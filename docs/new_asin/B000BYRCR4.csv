2447982,4,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is a Hollywood zombie. Because of the MPAA ratings, Resident Evil lacked the necessary gore a zombie masterpiece requires. . Although the film is serious and respectful to the story (about time, I am sick of post-Evil Dead films), Resident Evil would have been more powerful if it graphically showed the zombie bites, intestines, head explosions, etc.--like in Dawn of the Dead which was made independently and released unrated. But instead we are left with a typical action-horror limited by mainstream commercialism and the MPAA. I am just relieved that Resident Evil was treated seriously and has Mila Jovovich playing the main character. Mila Jovovich, who was brilliant in Luc Besson's The Messenger, carries the film from beginning to end without flaws in her performance. Her close-ups are beautiful and with her model features and eyes, she shows us a powerful woman on screen. She is definitely a talent to watch in the future.
Resident Evil is without a doubt an influence of DAWN OF THE DEAD. But RESIDENT is DAWN without gore. And that is a definite flaw. A good zombie film or a good horror film disturbs--it is suppose to make you sick. And when this sickness is combined with a serious approach storytelling and good acting, what you end up is usually a unique film or simply put, a classic. I remember when I first saw Dawn of the Dead, it had a good serious story, serious acting, and unforgettable sickness--head exposions, zombie bites, flesh eating, etc.--which made the film unique at the time. Although gore is considered by many as bad taste, a zombie film along with good serious storytelling and acting must have it in order for it to be a zombie masterpiece or a zombie art film. Resident Evil lacks the zombie gore.
Only time will tell if this zombie video game movie is really something of a classic. If Resident Evil is going to be a trilogy and if the sequels get better with the zombies, Resident Evil will be a classic trilogy.",1016236800,,1973,4.771929824561403
2447983,5,B000BYRCR4,"I watched this movie today and wow, it was great. The theatre had a line that went all the way outside and this was 30 minutes before the theatre opened and the theatre was packed. The movie was amazing. Keep in mind it was directed by the same guy who did the Mortal Kombat, which however, was not a flop like most other video game movies. When Resident Evil comes out on DVD it is definantly going to be a must have for any collector. Well what are you waiting for? Go out and see it now!",1016236800,,490,4.061855670103093
2447984,4,B000BYRCR4,"Well I think that Resident Evil was overall a decent movie. Although I was disappointed that the characters from the original RE Game, i.e. Chris, Barry, Jill, Rebecca, Wesker, etc. weren't in the movie, nor were almost all of the rooms from Resident Evil's Mansion. Firstly, the movie lacks the BRAVO squad and the STARS team, which I didn't like that much. The director took a creative licsence and did what he could keepin the story parallel to that of the video game story. The movie was pretty good overall, just don't go in looking to see Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, etc. Instead they have a character that resembles Jill, and a few new people. The movie starts off with the T-Virus being exposed and havoc and fear soon follow. The computer- instead of Tyrant as the main villain, there is a computer program made by Umbrella, designed with 'eyes' which are cameras located all over the place and a hologram of a young english girl- shuts down and seals all exits making it impossible for escape. Then it goes the reg. RE story, which is a good thign :), to the special forces, zombies, dogs, lickers, and much gore, and special effects in between. Don't expect an all's well ends well here.  The movie ends with a perfect setup for a sequel, so expect RE2 to be in the works very soon probably depending on the revenue. This is a pretty good movie for fans and non fans alike, just don't let your young ones go by themselves bc of the gore and nudity. Simply put- great movie, great time killer, and great to see with your friends.
In case you don't own the RE games yet, DEFINITLY GO BUY THEM!( and make sure you have a memory card) You don't need to know the game to watch the movie, but the RE Series is quite possibly the best genre out there for Playstation, PS2, Dreamcast, and soon to be Gamecube. Get your hands on these games, they've been out for awhile, are greatest hits and are cheap to get. Directors Cut, in my opinion is better then the original RE.",1016150400,,1977,4.461325966850829
2447985,4,B000BYRCR4,"... This film is great, many references to the game. Many zombie scenes. The zombies look great, even build more on them then the game ever did. The film may not be based on any of the games but there are so many similarities its almost hard to notice. I'm not gonna tell you the plot or any key moments because I don't want to spoil anything. The film takes place before the events in the first game and ends right in the middle of 2/3. Zombie infested Raccoon City is also seen, as well as the origin and identity of Nemesis! Go see it and enjoy it because this is probably the closest Hollywood will get to good video game movies.....well, except for the Crazy Taxi movie they're making.(HA-HA-HA, yeah right)",1016150400,2,712,4.401515151515151
2447986,5,B000BYRCR4,"I had expected Resident Evil to be good, but this movie is awesome. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez are the main stars in this horror movie. It also has bits and pieces of action/adventure/suspense/thriller. Alice and Rain are the two main leaders of a commando-team ( they appear to be similar to a S.W.A.T. team) who must enter an underground lab by the company Umbrella Corporation. That company unleashed a deadly virus and the team has a minimal three hours before it threatens to spread. Resident Evil manages to keep the audience entertained by killer zombies, flesh looking dogs, and a laser room (just to name a few). The acting is decent and the movie has a few good scares. This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in quite some time. I encourage you to go see it.",1016150400,,790,4.570422535211268
2447987,5,B000BYRCR4,"I, personally, think this will be a great movie (better than tomb raider by far). Most of the plot runs along with the original resident evil one game, with few exceptions (the red queen, new characters, etc.). I don't think that these new additions to the storyline will destroy the movie, unlike some people believe. I'm also glad to see that Josh Hartnett isn't in this as well, considering he's playing all different kinds of movies.
  I believe this does take place in the umbrella lab and underneath raccoon city (as did the first/second video games). I am not really sure, though, if our heroes will be going to the mansion. I didn't catch that part, but no matter, I think it will be a great thrill. By the way, don't listen to this kid from ""phenix"", he is criticizing the movie before it comes out and he can barely spell.
  But anyways, I'm going to see it today! I'm so psyched!",1016150400,4,890,4.4753086419753085
2447988,5,B000BYRCR4,"so far is looks awesome.  I definetely doesn't look cheap like Tomb Raider.  This movie definetely has some promise in it, seeing that they are going all out with the gory Resident Evil style.  This movie pretty much follows the way the games are made, (each game has a different main character, etc)  and according to some stuff I read, a lot of things in the movie are going to come straight from the game.  What do they mean by that, like herbs and stuff?  ...  well anyway, I've heard that we will be seeing a lot of the same kind of locations that were in the resident evil series, and the movie will definetely be as scary as the game.  probably lots of jumping!  I'm definetely going to see it.",1016064000,,701,4.290076335877862
2447989,3,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is from the source movie goers have learned to fear most--video games.  Resident Evil joins the glittering pantheon of such other video game to movie translations such as Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and even Super Mario Brothers.  It's certainly better than most of these but still is far from being a great horror film.
The original game started with the simple and uncluttered premise of being stuck in an isolated mansion with mysterious flesh eating mutated zombies and assorted other biological abberations that had to be fought past in order to find out that the whole mess originated from corporate experimentation in biological weaponry.  The game showed through clever use of shock effects, disturbing dramatic camera angles, and cinematic music that video games could be as scary and suspenseful as any horror film. In this way the game was a groundbreaker and amazingly influential and popular.
Now several years and game sequels later we have Resident Evil the movie.  The film clutters up the premise quite a bit.  Beginning with some unexplained corporate espionage that causes a spooky HAL like computer to kill everyone in the Umbrella building (or as it is explained later an underground hive) it cuts immediately to a half naked Milla Jovovich (she of the crazy red hair in The Fifth Element) waking up with amnesia in a shower and wandering alone in a strangely deserted palatial mansion that the computer is also monitoring.
Where are the zombies?
They do eventually show up and the creators of this film also borrow heavily from past successes such as Aliens, The Matrix, 2001:A Space Odyssey, and maybe even a little Memento.  The result is a mess and some of the action is incomprehensible sometimes it seems certain characters make their escapes out of impossible situations by simply being edited out of them. But the movie keeps moving frenetically and sometimes entertainingly along anyway.  The rest of the plot revolves around the mystery of the sabotage and a trip down into the sealed hive to solve the mystery.
Fans of the video games will be disappointed to not see Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine make an appearance.  Also zombies, hunters and mutant dogs are pretty much the only mutant monsters you get.
As far as the cast goes moviegoers will be left mainly remembering Jovovich's charming beauty and Michelle Rodriguez's(from the much superior low budget Girlfight) tough funny turn as one of the band of clean up soldiers who accompany Jovovich down into the hive.  Sure its a lift of Private Vasquez's character from Aliens but Rodriguez has such a gritty delivery that she makes the tired dialogue sound fresh and intentionally amusing.
The thudding rock score by Marilyn Manson does little to help and the various creatures are not imaginative enough to really inspire any horror.  There are various shock effects tactics employed throughout the film to keep moviegoers from getting restless.
The movie is an okay ride and probably worth a peak if you're a big zombie or Resident Evil fan.  Most of us will get more out of watching Aliens again.",1015977600,11,3133,4.994241842610364
2447990,4,B000BYRCR4,"Let's all hope this isn't another failed video game turned movie.
I was already driven away by Tomb Raider, Super Mario, and Street Fighter (ugh that was painful to watch).
If the filmakers decided to enlist help from people who are familiar with the series, it could be good.  If not, maybe there will a special...
If the movie stinks, then the soundtrack won't.  After all, they did get new tracks from Slipknot and Static X.
Either way, let's pray this won't stink.  And let's pray it makes more money than E.T. when it comes out that same week.",1015718400,,548,4.515151515151516
2447991,3,B000BYRCR4,"I hope the negative media reviews of Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy don't cling to RE before it debuts. I think it should stay exactly like the game. Paul Andreson said using Jill and co., fans would know who was killed and who survived. Yet,reading the reviews on the website Anderson ALREADY TELLS YOU who's going to live and die. So much for that reason! Being an overseas film,having B-rated actors/actoress+ its's a horror flick,it probably will dive. I love the game and have the action figures but I also know the film industry. So here's to the hope of being wrong and it becomes a smash (at least for them to make 2 and 3)  P.S. Why is it so hard for directors,producers etc.to appease gaming fans and such and do remakes and game movies just like the originals?",1015718400,3,770,4.5

Anyway, while this has several language options, everything defaults to English (that may be my PS3, not sure to be honest).
The 3D in this is as good as the previous RE movies, which I expected. Everything worked fine on PS3, it's not regionally coded.

This is a sci-fi/horror/action movie, so I can't understand the people whining about continuity and story-line, you're not watching the right genre. This is mindless entertainment, violent, bloody, Milla...

With the zombies taking over, the EVIL villain in charge (Thomas Kretschmann as Major Cain) decides to seal off the city and destroy it with a nuclear missile, then call it an accident, despite film footage stating otherwise.  Can the last few survivors manage to get out in time and in one piece?  And exactly just what is Program Alice?

2448050,2,B000BYRCR4,"After fighting her way through the tunnels of the Umbrella Corporation's Hive, Alice finds herself in the middle of Raccoon City's zombie outbreak!

I binged on the Resident Evil films this weekend and while the series is strong this one is fairly weak.  It marks a transition from an older style with practical special effects and conventional film making to the more stylized films that followed.  And the result is, even though this film is from 2004, it often feels like a low-middle budget films from the 80s.  The zombies are just extras with dirt smeared on them walking slowly.  The final monster looks and moves like a guy in a rubber suit.  The secondary characters are one dimensional 'jive talking black dude', 'tough chick' etc.

It's OK as part of the series but not as tense as the first film nor as over-the-top as the later ones.

I'd recommend instead seeking out the 5 film boxed set, this is much more acceptable as part of a longer series.

Then, it turns out, she joins a security team to find out exactly what happened underneath RACCOON CITY. Seems the ""Umbrella Corporation"" has been dealing with some kind of virus outbreak and they want it contained. Now, why at the end of the movie, would you want to reopen the closed doors of the ""hive"" to find out exactly what went on down there? lol Answer: to let out all the fools that got turned into zombies so they could infect the others above ground for Episode 2: ""Apocalypse"".
I loved this movie and the special features are well done, too! Great menu design with easy selections!

2448075,4,B000BYRCR4,"Many consider this sequel superior to part 1.  Im middle of the road.  The action is better but the writing seems worse, with the clich&eacute;s turned upa lot.  Still a pretty fun watch, though.

Narrated by Alice (Milla Jovovich; The Fifth Element, Resident Evil, Ultraviolet), a brief flashback montage catches us up with the story, which picks right up where it left off in 2002 as suited-up Umbrella technicians re-open the Hive.

Like part 1, Alice once again awakens quite scantily clad with no clue where she is.  This time in a surgical gownerrrra piece of one.  LOL. They sure do like having her wake up with a heavy dose of legs and side boob.  She has also clearly been operated upon or the subject of experimentation.  Alice wanders outside the facility to find the streets of Racoon City barrena newspaper headlined The Dead Walk blows by.  Nice touch, right?  We come to find that after her capture at the end of part 1 she had been dosed with the T-virus (a special strain, I suppose), making her a superhuman killing machine.

Picking up where Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) left off, newcomer director Alexander Witt (his only directorial feature, by the way) has turned the clich&eacute;s up hard. Supercop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory; Eragon, The Time Machine) slips out of her heels and into her Lara Croft Tomb Raider gear to solve Racoon Citys zombie apocalypse one headshot at a time in her tight breasty tube top and short-shorts; Carlos (Oded Fehr; The Mummy) likewise receives a nonsense-fueled opening action sequence; and the highly melodramatically written Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris; The Quiet Ones, Poltergeist) wheels out of his McMansion all smarty-pantsish like Professor Xavier.  There is also no shortage of various things random like ridiculous gratuitous acrobatics, zombies rising from the shallowest graves ever, no one ever missing a shot, topless zombie prostitutes, and yet more generally poor writing.

Racoon City is quarantined, trapping all within along with the virus-raging zombies.  Among those trapped is Dr. Ashfords young daughter.  Safely watching from outside the city, Ashford agrees to help Alice and Valentine escape if they can rescue her.  It's all very Escape from New York-ish (1981). Trapped in a city of undesirables, our bad-ass hero is infected with a virus and will find a grim outcome nearing the end of the film unless she can save the daughter of a scientist who waits safely outside the city.

Theres just one problem.  The Nemesis Program (mentioned at the end of part 1) is activated, awakening Alices old buddy who has now mutated into an unrecognizably hulking dreadnought resembling Hellraisers (1987) Chatterbox on steroids.

This sequel, much as its predecessor, features the lamest zombie scenesall phoned in and clearly wastes of film and make-up.  However, once Alice fights the Nemesis hulk, things get REALLY entertaining.  Im not a fan of the 30 Crouching Tiger Jedi jumps, the canned fight scenes, or how thousands of bullets perpetually miss Alice despite having no cover and minimal evasive maneuvers.  But the action sequence is really quite entertaining.  I roll my eyes more here than at the original, and part 1 was clearly better written (in my opinion), but this sequel truly succeeds at being more FUN however over-the-top it may be.

After a better final boss battle than part 1 offered, there is a still a lot to be desired in the fighting photography and choreography.  Even when featuring a hand-to-hand combat action finale, this sequel is clearly more about big explosions and blatant exposition than the quality of anything between. But again, its fun.  And Im grateful that the final boss wasn't another miscarriage of bad CGI.

We end very much how we beganand paralleling how part 1 ended and beganwith Alice recovered by Umbrella, naked (Amen for boobs, right guys?), and yet again the subject of further experimentation by Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen; Game of Thrones, Darkness).  No points for originality, but I enjoyed the ending anyway.  I enjoyed the whole thing.

Much as part 1 ended with the initiation of its sequels premise, so does part 2 leave the doors wide open for part 3: Initiate the Alice Program.  Id say keep going if you liked either of the first two.  Theres nothing particularly thoughtful to be found here, yet still a lot of effort was evident behind making this fun and exciting.",1486252800,,4453,4.990514905149052

2448080,4,B000BYRCR4,"Still a pretty fun watch for fans of mindless action and some occasionally decent gore, balanced by some terrible CGI and a lame boss.

I remember seeing Resident Evil in theaters in 2002 (LOVED it; I was 21), again in 2003 after I bought the movie, and once more (rewatching parts 1-2) before seeing part 3 in 2007.  Three times I had seen it and I recall quite enjoying it. But its been ten years and I was easier to please back then.  So I wondered, how would these videogame-to-movie-adaptation films hold up to my criticism now?

Profiteering from bioengineered virus technology (weaponized for the military) while masquerading as a home wares conglomerate whose products can be found in every household, the Umbrella Corporation is an original Proctor and Gambleonly evil.  Or at least one of their scientists was; the one who threw a glass vile of evil virus across the laboratory to volatilize through the vents and corrupt humanity.

Sometime after the incident, we find Alice (Milla Jovavich; The Fifth Element, Faces in the Crowd, Ultraviolet) with amnesia, leaving her memory as bare as her breasts.  Awakening naked in the shower in a lavish mansion, she has no idea who she is or how she got there.  She is taken by force by some sort of black ops team who expect her to remember much more than she does, and then things get interesting.

Theres a nice mix of characters, even if none of them ever develop into anything (except for more zombies, of course).  As Rain, Michelle Rodriguez (Furious 7, Machete Kills) continues her cute tough girl flavor that began with Girlfight (2000) and has persisted 17 years later (Fast & Furious 8).  In that vein, she has sort of a Hicks and Vasquez (Aliens) relationship with a colleague, both part of a larger team infiltrating the Hive and taking Alice along for the ride.  We also find Spence (James Purefoy; The Following, Rome, High-Rise) who, along with Alice, works for the Umbrella Corporation protecting the Hives entrance but now neither of them remember that.

We come to learn that The Hive, a subterranean research megaplex below Raccoon City, has an artificial intelligence: the Red Queen.  Her defense systems whittle down the infiltration team and at least one such scene really stuck with me.  To that end, the effects held up well enough and included some much-appreciated nuance. The CGI was pretty damned good for some parts and very bad for others.  For example, after getting laser-cubed, a soldiers eyeball leaks some white goo before its severed parts fell asunder.  I also liked the zombie dogs, which were less CGI and more live dog covered in goo suits.  On the other hand, certain zombies missing chunks of their face were blaring examples of obsolete CGI technology and the main monster almost looked as it would in the actual videogame complete with 128-bit graphics.  The boss creature was little more than a dumb tongue-lashing monster depicted as a CGI mess. I preferred the dogs and the chop suey lasers over this non-descript beast.

Director and writer Paul W. S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) did justice to the popular videogame with this popular horror-action franchise starter.  The movie may lean on heavy exposition (e.g., the introductory narration)but, hey, so did the game.  A lot of it is videogamified over-the-topand thats okay sometimes.  We have Milla jumping off walls to do jump kicks like Donnie Yen or Carrie-Anne Moss.  But I don't mind at all.

A major shortcoming for me was that the zombie action scenes were all pretty weak.  The bites were lame, the horde was uninspired, and outside of a few zombie kills by Milla, I could have done without them entirely.  It felt like stock footage from The Walking Deadyou know, the kills you don't really care about as the characters kill their way from points A to B.  Although I did enjoy our first meetings with zombies as the team was learning what they were (i.e., not alive).

In the end, a bunch of Umbrella scientists just appear as Alice and our other surviving (but clearly infected) hero escape the Hive.  Back to the exposition, one says: Hes mutating. I want him in the Nemesis programwere re-opening the Hive  Aaaaannnnnd cue the sequel as Alice wakes up again, now in a lab, and stumbles into the Apocalypse!

So there you have it.  Theres nothing particularly thoughtful to be found here, yet still a lot of effort was evident behind making this fun and exciting.  It came as no surprise that it was successful and infected multiple sequels.",1485907200,,4527,4.821243523316062

2448187,3,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is such a hot mess
Originally given to the Father of modern zombie George A. Romero (Go out of your way and read his script it was a bit different but, much better then what we got in the end)
The studio double crossed Romero and found a cheaper more lazy director/writer in Paul W.S. Anderson
Who would take the Resident Evil ""Brand"" down a deep dark hole where it needs to be buried once and for all
This is not a Resident Evil adaption it's a cheap action film with lots of terrible CGI F/X's and no real connection to the source material
Milla Jovovich character Alice doesn't even exist in the games
The only major highlight of this film is a naked Milla Jovovich but, she's a former eastern European model she'll get naked at the drop of a hat!
Anderson and Jovovich would get married after filming this so-called horror film  which would lead to the character of Alice taking over the Resident Evil Universe and pretty much be the face of these movies
You gotta love Hollywood  nepotism
Terrible spit in the face to all fans that grew up on these games
Without a doubt one of the worst video game adaptions ever  -5/10",1453766400,,1139,4.414285714285715

2448346,5,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse

 Oh boy, Raccoon City has only hours to exist before the cleansing flash of a nuclear weapon, the Zombies run amok and Alice has lives to save in what to my mind is the finest of the very successful Resident Evil films.  Milla Jovovich returns to her role as Alice, the Umbrella corporation security officer who we now know has been experimented upon.  Sienna Guilliory serves in the role of a very attractive cop in a mini skirt.  Oded Fehr plays another policeman, all three of them are survivors of the man made Apocalypse.  Young Sophie Vavasseur plays the young daughter of Dr. Ashford who the survivors must rescue from the soon to be wiped out city.
 Iain Glen (from Game of Thrones) has a supporting role.  Mike Epps also appears.  Watch for Kevin McKidd (Rome) in a small role as a cowardly victim.  This great cast would cause directors of lessor Zombie flick to have loud, envious stomach rumbles.
 Alexander B. Witt, a Chilean native, never mind his name, directed in his first time in the big chair.  He pulled it off in style and added some cool stuff, including a Zombie seen in the reflection of a police riot face mask.  He also has Milla Jovovich crash through a stained glass window on a motorcycle, jump off in a back flip then shoot the gas tank to blow up an especially nasty, bio-weapon Zombie.  That is just way cool.  In another cool bit Alice rigs up with ropes and runs down a sky scraper.  The level of filming, sound and special effects all reach the best levels.
 Paul W.S. Anderson wrote the screenplay.  Anderson has a long career as both a director-Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil (the first in the series),  the exceptional Event Horizon and the major studio film Pompeii in 2014.  He has been tagged to direct and write Resident Evil: The Final Chapter.  He has 11 credits as a full feature film writer including 5 RE films and one more to come.  He and Milla Jovovich tied the marriage knot in 2009.  He has 15 producer credits including many of the films that he either wrote, directed or both.
 We have a lot of action, very bad guys to hate and a script that makes the minimal level of sense that we need to go with the flow.  Some of the scariest bits in the movie involve Zombie dogs, real man eaters.  They are real dogs too, actor dogs with Zombie dog make up which we prefer to computer generated dogs or other monsters.
  Fans of the video games will find more or less constant references or reminders of the various versions of the games.  In another cool thing that Zombie film fanciers will like, there is a flash of a newspaper headline The Dead Walk.  The same headline also appears in George Romero's famous film Day of the Dead.
 I really liked this one.  I give it a superlative four brains.  It is rated R which we understand.  In one disturbing scene a news reported gets eaten alive by third grader Zombies.  Milla shows herself topless in a fairly extended view.
 The film cost a substantial $45 million to make but brought in over $129 million in world wide box office receipts.  More money of course continues to flow through TV and video sales.",1417996800,2,3128,4.501779359430605

2448349,4,B000BYRCR4,"The Zombie survival game series Resident Evil has gripped gamers hearts since 1997 when it first launched on the Playstaion 1. If you are a die hard RE fan prepare to be disappointed in this multimillion dollar popcorn flick's storyline. You aren't going to see your old friends Leon or Jill Valentine. Instead, we get to see Milla Jovovich as Alice, a mysterious reporter woman with some un-ordinary strength and perception. She is accompanied by a SWAT team that dwindles in size over the course of the movie. The group is led by Rain, a tough no nonsense badass chick. Their objective is to enter the Umbrella Corporation's underground testing facility and retrieve a sample of the T-Virus. But little did they know that all the employees that died aren't so dead anymore.

  The virus is a text book zombie contagion, causing death from infection and resurrection of the corpse. The reanimated corpses are classic slow moving, and have an insatiable hunger for living flesh. Some of the zombie scenes are scare you out of your seat good, while others are over done and disappointing. It is a fast paced shoot-em-up after the zombies debut. Ammo is scarce and there is no back up team. Their only choice is to retrieve the anti-virus and escape, or become another drone in the underground swarm of undead.

 Milla Jovovich stars as Alice in this three and a half brain Zombie fest.  Michelle Rodriguez supports with help from James Purefory late of Rome where he played Mark Anthony.  Paul W.S. Anderson directed from his own script.  The R rated film runs for 94 minutes and grossed world wide $102,000,000 on a $33,000,000 budget.  There are five live action Resident Evil films and one animated version, as of 2014.",1416960000,,1721,4.806779661016949

2448413,1,B000BYRCR4,"I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game series and zombie movies. Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.

Every problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.

Despite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.",1395273600,,1704,4.565359477124183

2448419,2,B000BYRCR4,"As it is the case with most sequels, this second instalment of ""Resident Evil"" franchise is significantly inferior to the first film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILLERS.

This film begins 30 days after the contamination of the Hive described in the first ""Resident Evil"" movie. In opening scenes the Umbrella Corporation attempts to unseal the Hive in order to eliminate its undesirable occupants and reclaim this huge, precious facility. It is suggested that this attempt doesn't go very well... Some days later Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an abandoned hospital in Raccoon City, naked, bruised and unable to remember jack... And then the film really begins.

The biggest problem with this film is that there is virtually no scenario, just a succession of shootouts and running. There is hardly any dialogs which would merit to be remembered, the sense of humour seems to have been completely eaten by zombies, most of decisions taken by people (both villains and good guys) doesn't make the slightest sense and let's not even talk about character development...

Milla Jovovich was asked to play here just a standard issue superhuman shooting machine and was clearly forbidden by the director to do and say anything else than shooting - and her two principal sidekicks, with whom she joins ultimately after more than 40 minutes (!) of film are even worse!

Sienna Guillory plays Jill Valentine, a police officer belonging to the Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.) who has the habit of coming to work dressed as a streetwalker and greatly praised may she be for that, because this firmer model is a supremely beautiful woman with such a figure, that Phidias and Praxiteles would KILL for the privilege of sculpting her (in more sense than one...). BUT, an actress she is REALLY not and even saying two lines of dialog is for her clearly an effort... And as for her character being an action hero, well, let's just say that she cannot even hold correctly the prop gun they gave her, because this thing clearly scares her...

Oded Fehr plays Carlos Oliveira, a mercenary from Umbrella Corporation private army - but being a simple soldier, he is completely unaware of all the evil plans of his bosses and in this film he actually is one of the good guys. Oded Fehr, who usually plays Bedouin holy warriors, demons from Hell or Arab terrorists, has of course all the necessary competence and physical attributes to make an awesome, legendary, bad@ss mercenary - but he is not really allowed in this film to do much. His character is just a subdued sidekick of Alice...

Another big issue with this film, that everything is centred around Alice and it really is hard to understand why is she SOOO important? Alice! Who the (----) is Alice!? But even worse, Alice enters the movie for real only after 40 minutes and in the meantime nothing really very important happens...

The second part of the film (once Alice appears) is slightly better than the completely useless first 40 minutes, but the operative word here is ""slightly"". There is a couple of good action scenes, but they are few and short. Of course, between those good action scenes quite a lot of munitions gets expended but mostly it is just a shooting of various fish in the barrels.

There is one sequence, involving an elementary school, which is not bad and will certainly delight all those who simply hate kids and puppies. It also makes sense that in the middle of an anthropophagic zombie infestation an elementary school is a particularly dangerous place, because playful kids need hearty balanced meals on a regular basis...))) On another hand the director couldn't follow this idea until its logical conclusion, because then this film would probably be banned in most countries...

The ending logically opens the way for the next film in the franchise and ask again the same question: Alice! Who the (----) is Alice?

Bottom line, this film is really not good and I managed to suffer through it all the way until the end only with some fast forwarding here and there (especially during all the one sided shootouts). This DVD is definitely NOT a keeper. Avoid!",1391385600,,4169,4.859154929577465
2448420,3,B000BYRCR4,"I found this action/SF/horror/zombie flick inspired by the video game ""Resident Evil"" quite watchable and entertaining, although it is really not a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Deep underneath Raccoon City exists a large, secret genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the Umbrella Corporation. The whole site is controlled and managed by an artificial intelligence called the Red Queen. At the very beginning of the movie SOMETHING happens which makes the Red Queen seal the Hive and start killing everyone inside.

Exactly at the same moment an attractive young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a deserted mansion - bruised, naked and unable to remember jack... Then she realises the manor is not as deserted as it first looked... And then the film really begins.

Well, as adaptations of video games go, this one is better than most and actually it is a pretty decent action film. Personally, I never liked much zombie flicks (with the only exception being the old black and white classic ""Night of Living Dead"") but this one is quite watchable. Action scenes are not bad, there are some rather good (sometimes pretty cruel) twists, Milla Jovovich is very sexy and Michelle Rodriguez offers a great performance as a Very Macho Commando Girl With Big B@lls Of Fire...))) Also, the Red Queen is a pretty interesting villain.

On another hand dialogs are not so great and there is little humour. Even if there are some twists the whole story is rather predictable and the ending, albeit necessary for the already then planned sequel, is really silly.

Bottom line, this is a honest action/SF/horror/zombie flick, mostly enjoyable because of two main actresses - but it is nothing more and I don't think I will keep the DVD for future viewings. Still, a honest watch, especially recommended for viewing after a very hard day at work, when one is simply too tired to think much and just needs something to go nicely with beer.",1391126400,,1994,4.940298507462686

2448422,4,B000BYRCR4,"Superbit DVD, High quality encode that when plays via an Upscaling DVD player, produces quality that matches Blu-ray pound for pound. There are no special features because of the high bit rate used, but from my experience, nobody watches those anyway. Aspect ratio is 1.85:1 aka it fills your widescreen TV.

I abandoned Blu-ray after I found it to be too restrictive of a format. Hardcore DRM that requires firmware updates via Sony servers and limited access to view your disks anywhere you want. Slow loading times and the security risk and less than stellar quality of the players. I now own an upscaling DVD player and have HD TV service, and I'm 100% satisfied as are many others.

Digital downloads like Amazon's service and cheap DVD's and upscaling players have all but killed Blu-ray. Sony is desperate now to the point of manipulating sales numbers and putting ""plants"" on sites like Amazon to try and boost sales. DVD's are outselling Blu-ray 3 to 1 now but Sony has a plan to manipulate those numbers by including the DVD with the Blu-Ray...it counts totally as a Blu-Ray sale and thus manipulates the numbers.",1389744000,2,1123,4.813471502590674

2448444,4,B000BYRCR4,"I am not going to provide a movie synopsis as there plenty of reviews which summarize this film. Instead this will be an attempt to focus why i like it.
  Out of the movies released to date(five so far with the sixth and final announced), RE: Apocalypse is my favorite. Not only did Writer/Producer Paul W.S. Anderson learn from his successful first installment, but was able to up the ante in a way that worked. In addition to being able to intensify the action from the first movie, I felt he maintained a story line that allowed characters to develop - which is something that has been virtually non-existent in RE: Afterlife and Retribution. With only a couple of exceptions, such as the cemetery scene (How did the T-Virus get to the interned corpses to infect them?), I enjoyed seeing the various responses to the outbreak by the main characters i.e. losing a close friend, being abandoned by your employers, dealing with overwhelming number of the undead and so on. There was more at stake than just a small elite team of soldiers in this film, it was a chance to stop the T-Virus before it infected the global population.
Milla Jovovich establishes herself in a rather elite company of female actresses (Angelina Jolie, Kate Beckinsale and Michelle Yeoh to name a few more) who can pull off the believable action heroine. The supporting cast of Oded Fehr and Sienna Guillory for action with Mike Epps for comic relief worked for me. Thomas Kretschmann did a good job as the Umbrella man put in charge of containing the outbreak that turns people in zombies - yet using the situation as a the prefect test for making sure various top secret projects of the corporation, such as Project ALICE are feasible and potentially profitable.
I admit I prefer the film series to the video games and the animated films so the fact the character Alice is purely invented for the movie does not bother me. I do watch the Extras and Special features on discs, especially deleted/extended scenes. For RE: Apocalypse I thought the extent and subject matter of Special Features was very good, such learning about the idea to give each character their own specific type of firearms so you identify it with him or her and watching how various stunts were designed and executed in the six-part 'Making of' documentary.",1375920000,4,2305,4.745635910224439

Pretty much nothing in the story makes sense, no-one behaves in a remotely believable way. (People line up peacefully to get let out of a city, with cannibal zombies behind them? People aren't even that polite on the subway).

Atrocious camera work just adds insult to injury. They did manage one rather nice plot surprise that I didn't see coming. About the only good point in the picture.",1375660800,,436,4.64935064935065

2448448,3,B000BYRCR4,"This is the second installment in the Resident Evil movie series and yet again it has been overdone. I've been a long time veteran of the games and have been very disappointed with how the directors brought it to the big screen. While the series is action packed and entertaining, the characters and their personalities are smeared all over the floor and they've reached too far to other crowds who probably aren't familiar with the series. After seeing the first film, I was apprehensive but still interested in seeing Apocalypse. I think they did a great job creating Nemesis and he was the best part of this film by far. Unfortunately the side story is mediocre and they totally destroyed all of the Resident Evil 3 characters I played as and loved. Jill Valentine (known as ""Valentine"" here) in the game is a cool, collected, smart gal with a pretty good intuition. In this movie she is a macho, loud-mouthed, jealous girl who lacks a warm personality and cusses up a storm. She's like Jill's evil twin sister. Carlos is a likeable character but he's totally an American in this movie. Both Nicolai and Mikhail (they call him something else in the movie) die very early on. Alice has always been exclusive to the film series, and while she is a good actress with an interesting back story, she was never in the games (to my knowledge).

The problem I have with these RE films is that they are way overdone - everybody is macho and fights to heavy metal or bad techno. It is totally to sell tickets. None of the characters share the humble qualities of inner strength and determination like in the games. There is no depth to anyone and it's hard to connect. The movie hits hard and leaves no lasting impressions. I keep thinking, ""less is more"", but that is not their philosophy - they want it all out on the table and leave nothing up to the viewers to be figured out.

Good as entertainment for an hour and a half, but definitely not true to the series, nor does it do the games justice. You must turn part of your brain off and forget everything you know about the Resident Evil games to enjoy this flick.",1374192000,,2112,4.511749347258486
2448449,1,B000BYRCR4,"Wow, the first Resident Evil movie was nothing amazing or original but it was a decent, competently made little sci-fi/action/horror flick but this sequel manages to be worse in just about every possible way. Visually the movie looks terrible and shockingly it had a bigger budget than the first movie, never would've guessed that looking at the movie, many times when the zombies appear on screen the picture gets all distorted and the framerate becomes almost like a slideshow, if this was a really low budget movie I would say it was a technical issue but seeing as how it wasn't this was clearly deliberate and why any director would go out of their way to make their movie look as awful as possible is just beyond any logic or coherence. Aside from the that it's also filled with lots of extreme quick cutting, cheap post production looking slow mo, and the action scenes filmed mainly in close ups with quick cutting and shakiness make em utterly unwatchable.

Music wise it's very bland forgettable techno-ish stuff that lacks the memorable factor of Manson's music from the first movie. For an R rated zombie movie there's not really any blood or gore at all, aside from some F bombs and a few boob shots it feels much more like a PG-13. Aside from Oded Fehr none of the acting is particularily good, even Jovovich is off but I blame the director more than her. Also the big giant monster in the movie suddenly turns good and almost cries, yeah really lame. Easily the worst of the Resident Evil movies and one of the worst mainstream movies of the past decade, it's honestly right up or should I say below there with the average Uwe Boll movie.",1373673600,,1653,4.603389830508474

2448465,4,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse manages to be a better action movie than the original.  The movie picks up a few weeks after the end of the first. The action sequences dominate this movie.  'Project' Alice (Milla Jovovich) really breaks out in this sequel.  She awakens stronger by virtue of being injected with the T-virus in the Racoon City Research Center.  We see her being monitored before being released by the conniving Major Cain.  Outside, Project Alice  is confronted with a ravaged Racoon City (seen at the edn of the first movie) and takes up arms.  Alice is now is full at war mode against the zombies and eventually Major Cain and The Umbrella Corporation.  Along the way, she uncovers more lies and betrayal as she wages a war against the evil conglomerate.  There is a side story about the renegade police officer, Jill Valentine and the attempts to rescue Angie Ashford (who has good health thanks to the T-virus injected into her bu her crippled father, Dr. Ashford.  This film provides more background on Alice and the Umbrella Corporation.  There are some good supporting characters in L.J., Carlos, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) & little Alice Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur) (AKA as the voice of the 'Red Queen' (The Umbrella Corporation's supercomputer).  The villains are Major Tom Cain played by Thomas Kretschmann and Dr. Isaacs played with gusto by Iain Glen. The anti-hero, Dr. Ashford (the designer of the 'Red Queen') is played well by Jared Harris. All these characters help the story line and provide more background into the movie.  The battle between Project Alice and Nemesis (an acquaintance of Alice's) is very good. The twist ending is good and tells you there is more afoot.  I enjoyed this action movie with zombies thrown in for good measure. PS, the zombie dobermans are back for another bite.  Overall, this is a very good action/science fiction film with some scary moments.",1367020800,2,1910,4.962264150943396
2448466,5,B000BYRCR4,I was not a fan of the games or book series until I watched this. I am now hooked on the whole thing. The movie starts with a an underground lab where scientists are paid to create classified millitary and medical advancements. Something goes wrong and everyone is killed by the super computer encharge. A team goes in to figure out want happened and the zombies attack. What I think makes this great is that it could accually happen. Many zombie movies don't explain why. The govenment working secretly on biological weapons and enhancements is very likely. Something going wrong and it being covered up is very likely. Just know that there would not be 5 movies and a book and game series if this was a bad movie.

This is pure action/science fiction/horror with a capital ""E"" = escapism, excess, evil, and eye-popping.  It is beneath it all an amped-up zombie movie with an evil 'big brother' (The Umbrella Corporation)twist thrown in for good measure.  This film is more horror than the sequels.  This first film in a series sets one up for where this is heading, a futuristic world being manipulated by an evil conglomerate.  The plot is this, someone has released the T-virus in the underground labs of the Umbrella Corporation.  The only none survivors are Alice (Milla Jovovich)and Spence parks (James Purefoy), the 'married' security officers. A special rescue/security team (led by Colin Salmon and Michelle Rodriguez) takes them and a 'police officer'Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius with them into the underground Racoon City complex.  There, they must deal with the super computer, the 'Red Queen; (voiced by Sophie Vavsseur)- the daughter of the computer's inventor and designer, the former complex staff turned zombies by the T-virus , zombie doberman dogs and mutants.  Along the way, they discover betrayal, an eco-advocacy/terrorism plot and corporate greed. In the lead role of Alice, Ms. Jovovich shines as the initially confused and drugged security officer who slowly realizes her role in this tragedy and is able to deal with the evil that exists all around her.  She comes out the hero but is soon at the mercy of the Umbrella Corporation which designates her as ''Project' Alice and the other survivor, Matt Addison as Project 'Nemesis.'",1367020800,,1673,5.143911439114391

2448492,2,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is meant to be a video game series and *not* a movie series.  Simple as that.  Why?  Because the movie writers made Apocalypse nothing more than a generic run of the mill zombie flick, and a rather average one at that.

They bring in Nemesis, what I consider the ULTIMATE bad guy in the classic Resident Evil 3 game.  While extremely dangerous and intimidating in the video game, he does nothing but plod along in a slow moving way in the movie.  He's still relatively cool I suppose, with the ability to detect those who are armed and pose a threat to him which is a fascinating feature, and of course, his trusty rocket launcher is as explosive in the movie as it is in the game (of course it is- Hollywood can smell a perfect opportunity for special effects and the rocket launcher surely satisfies in that regard).  However, in the game (as Jill) you had to REALLY move your legs as quickly as possible or you'd get caught.  He's not fast enough in the movie so everyone can easily run away from him.  Cool looking, but lacking speed.  This is a vital and distinct feature that's missing.

I'm also not particularly fond of the fact that Jill Valentine takes a back seat so the always attractive Milla Jovovich can shine in the spotlight.  Throughout the film Jill basically sticks behind Milla's character so Milla can take care of all the approaching danger.  Meh, Jill deserves better in my opinion.  Also, it seems strange that Raccoon City is so enormous.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big city in the video game series so this makes total sense, it's just that it's hard to believe (without spoiling the ending in both the movie *and* video game) such a big city would be considered irrelevant when you-know-what happens at the end.  Not a good storyline direction for a movie.

There's nothing remotely scary about this movie.  Apocalypse is not going to appeal to Resident Evil 2 survival horror fans, that's for sure.  All kinds of adrenaline pumping shooting action aroung every corner with several Resident Evil 4-style athletic kicks and jumps is what you can expect instead.  I say avoid this movie and stick with the gaming series.",1361318400,,2161,4.636842105263158

It doesn't have the timbre of supernatural or horror film that I've been told sequels do.

2448543,5,B000BYRCR4,"I like Sci-Fi horror films and this one is a good one. It is based on a video game of the same name and it has really become a cult type of zombie film. A beautiful woman named Alice wakes up in a large mansion and doesn't know who she is or where she is. She is really an guard for the Umbrella Corporation which is the largest company in the USA. They are also a company deeply involved in military technology and viral weaponry.

A deadly mutating virus has been released and the massive hidden facility below the ground is being shut down with all of the employees trapped inside. It is located under the mansion where Alice is. Alice is a guard who was living in the mansion which really is the entrance to the facility called the Hive. As she wanders about trying to recognize where she is at as a group of commandos break into the mansion.....

This movie is just constant action and suspense. The commandos and Alice try to reenter the Hive to see what has happened only to find out that the mutating T-Virus has escaped and the Hive's employees are infected. In addition, several of the Hives experimental creatures have escaped. Alice and the commandos are now trapped in the hive with no way to escape and they are being attacked by the creatures and Hive's employees who are now zombies. This movie is filled with high tech special effects and it is an excellent horror story with zombies and monsters galore. If you like scary movies with a high tech theme then this is a good film for you. I enjoyed and I recommend it to you.",1346976000,,1540,4.381118881118881

2448546,3,B000BYRCR4,"When I first heard that they were going to make a movie based of of one of my favorite video game franchises of all time I couldn't even begin to tell you the level of excitement I felt. I began climbing the walls with impatience and counting down the days until the films release. However after I viewed the movie I felt something completely different. Confusion and dissapointment, I couldn't believe that the film makers actually had the audacity to call this 'Resident Evil'. This movie goes against everything from the first resident evil game, and even finds new ways to annoy avid fans of the once great series of resident evil games.

Instead of this movie following the Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. team an a mansion located in the Arklay mountains we instead follow a Spec Ops team hired by or created by Umbrella (I wonder why they don't just use the U.B.C.S.) a security operative, and environmentalist, and an Umbrella employee. So we are off to a pretty sad spot to begin with. This film feature zero, that is right, ZERO characters from the first resident evil game and doesn't even come close to even getting the basic premise correct. Instead of this taking place in a mansion, we are in an underground lab, instead of Jill or any other cool resident evil characters we get these, somewhat interesting, set of characters, we only get to see two B.O.W.s, and I really can't believe they did this but, they had the nerve to change the way the virus spread to Raccoon City. In the game William Burkin had just finished his work on the G-Virus when Umbrella sent mercenaries to retrieve the sample from him, morally wounding him in the process. With William's last breath he injects the g-virus into his system and attacks the mercs and destroys all viles of the g and t-virus. Some sewer rats start drinking and gnawing on the capsules and then spread the virus throughout the city. In this movie the idiot scientist decide ""hey lets jut re-open the lab that we know is filled with dangerous monsters and walkers so we can find out what happened instead of downloading the security footage from a secure location."" Surprise surprise the virus runs rampant throughout the city.

Now if the writers actually played the game, or even cared about the fans they wouldn't have had the movie end that way, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

As we journey throughout the new location (that being the underground lab) we get some really interesting scenery as we get to see locations of manufactured B.O.W.s' and even locations where they tested the T-virus and designed it. I was actually curious about where this road was taking us in terms of story, so as the Special Ops team is sent in to deactivate the lab's A.I. system they have to cut the power, which releases all of the walkers that were contained in the offices and testing room, and the group is forced to do battle. Here is where the movie actually becomes pretty interesting, sure this movie is a stab in the back to all fans of the games, however, there are still some entertaining moments of the film and this is certainly one of them. The group begin fighting the undead but are curious as to why they keep getting up no matter how many times they are shot in the torso.

*Me personally, if I shot an attacker 7 times in the chest and they just shrug it off I'm going to aim for the head. To bad these characters would rather waste ammo than use their brains.

Our survivors are then forced to fall back, but due to heavy zombie presence, are separated as the writers thankfully bring some parts of the resident evil games into this movie. What I mean by that is we get a licker, who shows up at the end of the movie, and zombie dogs. This is where I was very excited to see how authentic these B.O.W.'s would be, and they are very authentic and in fact very scary to see in a live action film.

Alice wonders into a dog kennel and when I was watching this for the first time I said to myself ""Oh please, please don't be a tease"" and this anything but. It is here that we get an immensely satisfying battle between Alice and the zombie dogs as she takes on the entire kennel and even kills that last one with a pretty cool air kick to the face.

Alice manages to regroup with Matthew and the others as they try and find a way out of the facility before they become trapped and left to die. They discover a way out through the maintenance tunnels only to get swarmed by walkers. They just barely make it out alive, but two of the remaining spec ops team members (Rain and Kaplan suffer bites and are now both infected) This is even worse for Rain as she was bitten earlier in the movie and now the infection is spreading even faster now. As they attempt to escape their current predicament one of the pipes breaks causing Kaplan to fall the zombie bit below, he survives his encounter and tells the group to leave him behind as they don't have nearly enough ammunition to kill the walkers and he is too far away for there to be any probable rescue. He unloads his revolver and realizes that he only has one bullet left, which he uses to dispose of a walker before crawling away.

It is here that the remaining members of the group (Alice,Matthew,Spence, and a very much infected Rain) journey through the labs where the virus was being tested and manufactured, it is also here that Alice remembers exactly where the cure was located as well. When they arrive to this location she discovers the cure to be missing and we find out who is responsible (it is Spence big surprise there) as he locks the group in the room after he receives a bite from a walker. He makes his way to the train where he had the cure and virus the entire time, only to die from a very hungry licker.

*I was very excited to finally see this thing actually have some significance in the movie, for the most part it just wonders around the facility teasing the fans with its presence. Though I suppose they were ultimately building up suspense for the creatures inevitable battle with the few remaining survivors.

Kaplan rejoins the group as they make their way to the train, retrieve the cure and begin administering it to the infected members of the group (Rain and Kaplan).Only to have their happy moment interrupted by a still very hungry licker. Now we get, what I have to admit is a pretty cool battle. There is almost no stopping this beast, Alice even takes Rains .45 pistol and shoots three rounds point blank into its face and all that does is piss it off. But I have to complain about this part as well. In resident evil 2 you can discover a file that describes just how dangerous this monster is. The file says how its tongue cut a man apart, yet Alice gets hit right in the face with it and all that happens is she falls on her back.

After defeating this monster the only survivors are Alice and Matthew, they make their way up to the mansion and are greeted by Umbrella scientists. Alice and Matthew are again separated and Alice regains consciousness in a hospital. She discovers that the city has been overrun and her battle is far from over.

My god this movie was disappointing, there is almost nothing recognizable about this movie. I find it highly insulting to even call this a 'resident evil'movie when so much is changed. They changed the story,characters,location, virtually everything is different. With all that has been aid I have to confess that I actually kind of like this movie. I know how it sounds but it is actually enjoyable, even with all of the flaws. I just don't understand why they call it resident evil when so much is different.",1341705600,,7610,4.486642599277978

It's no wonder that people love the movies, there's enough suspense, campy undead, action, feminine vulnerability coupled with a kickass attitude for most people who like a movie to entertain them.  As they series progresses, so does the development of Alice's character.  Yet in this first installemnt - I can appreciate the initial concept and the ""coming into oneself"" aspet of who Alice is.

NOW the sequel makes MUCH more sense to me - I detested it the first time around and haven't even seen the third of the trilogy - now I have both on order and can't wait to get my hands on them.

One of the points that ""people"" miss--and I use quotes because I do believe this type of film has its female fans, but the game and the movie by and large is ""consumed"" by a predominantly male audience--is that this is not only a very, very fun action/zombie flick, but with a powerful female action heroine.  I'm seeing this more and more in movies and as a female person, I am thoroughly enjoying it.  Resident Evil is one of the leaders of the pack in this regard.  I am compiling a collection of videos that are not only great movies, but have great female leads.  I've been waiting for this trend all my life; someone to identify with in a film who isn't a screaming victim!  THANK YOU CAPCOM!",1337817600,5,1051,4.173267326732673

2448552,4,B000BYRCR4,I love the video game series. I still remember buying Resident Evil 2 when I was a teenager and taking it home and playing it for the first time. It just sucked me in instantly and before you know it I was out looking for the first one. This movie is no different. It sucks you in from the very beginning and doesnt let up till the end. It is a fantastic action/horror/sci-fi movie that is filled with great special effects. If you are a zombie or video game lover this film is for you.,1336953600,,486,4.126315789473685
2448553,3,B000BYRCR4,"It's a sci-fi/horror-action film about a sprawling, secret undeground research facility where illegal and dangerous scientific experiments are taking place.  Naturally something goes wrong.  A SWAT team is sent in to figure out what happened.  They figure out they are in over their heads, and spend the rest of the movie fighting their way out.  That's basically it.

Insofar as these types of films go, this one isn't terrible.  It does have its strengths.  Being underground for the majority of the film, there is a creepy, middle-of-the-night atmosphere to it that kind of works (kind of).  And the lead actress, Milla Jovovich, has a certain presence that works because she manages to be tough and gorgeous at the same time.

On the other hand, there is no depth to the plot, or the characters.  The dialogue is cringe-worthy at times (e.g. ""These people used to WORK here!""), and for an action film, the action is pretty tame.  It's also worth noting that the zombies are not particularly scary.

If you are in the mood for a simple, cheap guilty pleasure to watch late at night when you can't sleep, this film is decent.  However, if you are looking for something challenging, unique, or moving, you probably won't like this movie.",1332374400,,1238,4.838095238095238

2448559,5,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse is, of course, the second in the (so far) four-part, video-game inspired, film franchise. It picks up where the first film left off, with Alice (Mila Jovovich) waking up in hospital to find that Raccoon City has been taken over by the undead and sealed off by her erstwhile employers (the Umbrella Corporation) Oh noes! What will she do? Well, she'll need to get dressed, for a start.

Now, let's be clear. This film (and it's stable-mates) have no pretentions to high art. Neither are they really intended to faithfully reproduce the games from which they developed. The RE film series is no more than a bunch of zombie movies and I think we need to hold on to that thought. There will be plenty of shuffling, slack-jawed, dead-eyed ghouls (but that's enough about Amazon reviewers), gallons of gore and, as the protagonists have access to military-grade weaponry, a far-from-modest body-count. The story-line, believability and acting all take second place to the really important stuff - heads coming off and good-looking heroes/heroines and at least we can take comfort that the director and producer understood that perogative.

Indeed, it would be hard to find a better looking heroine than Milla J, who established herself as Alice, zombie dispatcher extrordinaire in RE1. This time 'round she has some superhuman powers which I admit, regardless of my earlier comments, do stretch the imagination somewhat. She sure can ride a motorbike, though. Milla/Alice is ably assisted by Carlos (Oded Fehr) a rugged, handsome SWATesque type fellow and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) a svelte, sexy police officer type lassie. Good looking indeed - in a pinch, I'd go with Oded, but I'd be thinking of Sienna. Mike Epps also tags along as a Huggy Bear type character, but he is really only there for comic value and to give the cast some (ahem) diversity.

Their task is to rescue a sweet little girl, fight off a big bloke in a rubber monster suit (not to mention all those pesky zombies) and flee the city before it is ""sanitised"" by the naughty old Umbrella Corporation. Just another day in small town America, then. Really though, this does its job admirably, if you're willing to accept some big plot ""issues"". How can an entire city be cut off from the outside world? How can the corporation then nuke it (sorry! spoiler!) and pass it off as a power station accident? How can the Umbrella Corporation achieve such fantastical things but still designs a swipe-lock that can be opened by poking it with a needle and a computer security system that can be hacked by typing in ""find password""? How does Jill manage to keep her bouncy bits from popping out of that boob-tube every five minutes? I think we should be told.

Fortunately the visual elements of the film (special effects, zombie makeup, sexy cast, blood, brains and great big bangs) make up where the plotline fails and, if you can achieve a zombie-like level of mental activity (""Braaaaaiiiins!"") you can extract maximum pleasure from this fine example of the cinematic arts.

Battleship Potemkin? Citizen Kane? Pshaw!",1323648000,,3108,4.923664122137405
2448560,5,B000BYRCR4,"This film (and more generally the series of films) does seem to attract its fair share of opprobrium and, looking at the spread of ratings it's got here on Amazon, it's not even just a ""love it or loathe it"" film - it's pretty much fairly covered by every point on the spectrum. One fairly common theme of the ""hate it"" reviews appears to be that it offends devotees of the computer game from which the film series originated. Only having played RE on the PS1 once, I personally have no concept of whether the transfer to celluloid has been appalingly botched but, in any case, I think that it's a little unfair: there can't be many films that were able to faithfully reproduce the game/book/comic/etc from which it was derived. Similarly, another common theme is that it's some sort of failed pretender to the Romero throne. Again, I haven't seen any of his films (I did see the Dawn remake) so I am unlikely to be offended on that score either.

Oh well, enough of that. I am one of this film's fans. Let me say up front that I realise that it has some fairly fundamental believability problems. However, if you hang your belief on the peg at the door and accept the film for what it really /is/ and ignore the director/producer/actor waffle on the ""Making of"" documentary about how they loved playing the game and wanted to reproduce the experience in the cinema then there should be no reason to really hate the film. And what it really is, is a zombie flick for the 21st century. Pure, simple and unambiguous. It has all the elements. A dwindling cast of ""survivors"" are trapped or confined in an environment that is literally crawling with the undead. Cue heroics, treachery, an enormous body-count and an ordnance expenditure that would shame the US Army. It's not all guns, though and the more usual means of zombie-disposal - decapitation by means of a handy fire-axe, iron pipe or simple neck-twist - is preserved for the pleasure of the traditionalists.

The story is admirably supported by the gorgeous Ms Jovovich, complete in knee-length boots and a strappy red dress, who literally kicks ass. She is ably assisted by a SWAT team which includes Colin Salmon, and Michelle Rodriguez adds a little more killer-chick eye-candy to the ensemble. Eric Mabius and James Purefoy also tag along, but the film is really all about Mila and the zombies and that is, perhaps, where the film suffers a little. This central theme is diluted by all the trappings of the computer game that the director felt he had to squeeze in: the all-powerful Umbrella Corporation, the computer system gone bad, the theft of the zombie virus and some nonsense about genetically engineered creatures (""Lickers"" I think? and in the second film the Nemesis creature) on the loose. I suppose that some viewers may also fret that there is a bit too much of the leading lady and not enough zombie peril, but I have always been of the opinion that you can't ever see too much of Mila Jovovich (and you can parse that statement however you like).

Overall, the film works for me. I would never call myself a zombie connoiseur but, with some minor reservations, this does its job very nicely. There are plenty of shocks and thrills, an elegant sufficiency of gore and you can play the ""who gets it next and how?"" game with your friends. Bargain! The zombies themselves are well executed (actually, that's quite a good double-entendre, isn't it?) and the setting is suitably claustrophobic: indeed, being set in an underground research facility (""The Hive"") does lend the film an constricted, linear, escape-down-this-corridor feel to it that actually recalls the game series quite nicely.

Perhaps then that is where the film fails (in a small way): it's trying too hard to satisfy two different audiences, the gamers and the Romero fans, but ends up being a compromise and maybe (just maybe) the people who will get the most out of the film are those (like me) who fall into neither category.

I tend to be quite free and easy with my 5 star ratings but, in this case, I feel justified. This film is one that I frequently return to regardless that the shocks and surprises generally don't anymore and my copy will never find its way to a car boot sale.

There was Leon & Claire that had to survive through the city let alone, Jill Valentine had to go through the city herself.  Although the 3 had their own battles that they had to deal with and knowing how to deal with what would be put in from those games I think had to be a difficult decision.

2448588,4,B000BYRCR4,"RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is the second film in what is so far a four-film franchise, and it takes the first movie and ramps it up by several notches. And, cripes, that T-Virus sure is a real mother. The sitch as this sequel opens is this: a zombie plague has scoured Raccoon City, thanks to the ill dealings of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's largest pharmaceutical agency and just possibly the most diabolical global entity, like, ever. Precautions have been taken. Raccoon City has been entirely sealed off, the sun setting on a population left to fend for itself, probably feed on itself. Throughout the city, measures have been taken to ensure the evacuation of Umbrella Corporation's key personnel. The scientist who invented the T-Virus, for one, gets out safely. But his young daughter doesn't. At sunrise, Raccoon City is scheduled for a tactical nuclear strike. Some really heavy sunscreen is recommended.

The story tracks a tiny band of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to escape the city limits. It helps that this group is made up primarily of highly skilled operatives from the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) unit and also from an Umbrella strike force. It also helps that the scientist who invented the T-virus is willing to guide them to safety, provided they rescue his young child. The odds for survival increase dramatically with the arrival of Alice, former head of security for an underground Umbrella complex. But it's a slightly different Alice than from what we remember in the first movie. She's been experimented on by the Umbrella think tank and she now demonstrates super powers. Another survivor from the first movie figures in APOCALYPSE, except that he'd been tweaked and probed and genetically engineered into becoming the terrifying Nemesis program. And no surprise that even with a city apocalypse going down, there are still fiendish Umbrella asshats bent on pursuing their messed-up experiments - such as pitting the Nemesis Program and Alice against each other, in a backstreet brawl, just to see who'd come out on top.

Plot, sphlot. This is survival horror cinema, so one shouldn't expect too much verisimilitude or texture. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE was designed with crunching zombie kills and gory special effects in mind. Sexy Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr step into the fray as two uber-capable action heroes in their own right. But Milla Jovovich owns this franchise, and she again lends her fantastic looks and her palpable physicality. Milla is fearless when it comes to committing to her action sequences, and she performs a lot of her own stunts, including rappelling 60 feet down the side of a high rise edifice. She really anchors the film, drives most of the spectacular action set pieces.

Plenty of gamers complained that the first film strayed too far from the video game, and here's APOCALYPSE attempting to atone. Consequently, game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory), Carlos Olivera (Fehr), and Nicholai Ginovaef are introduced, and the hulking Nemesis program is the featured Big Bad. The character of Alice was, of course, originally invented for the film franchise. The lickers are back, as are the gore hounds. Plenty for our good guys to shoot to bits. And, as ever, no dearth of the shambling undead, including a pack of flesh-eating school children.

Mike Epps provides the comedy relief, but you should watch the movie anyway.

What I have is the 2-DVD Special Edition with tons of bonus material. Disc one has the feature presentation with the option to view it in either wide or full screen and three audio commentary tracks (including one with actors Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Milla Jovovich and Milla's unfortunate cackling - and they sure make fun of Germans a lot). Disc 2 has: 20 forgettable deleted scenes, 12 minutes worth; cast outtakes; ""Game Over: RESIDENT EVIL Reanimated"" - a six-part ""Making Of"" the film (focusing respectively on the stunts, the zombie choreography (the Undead Boot Camp), the sets, the weapons used, and the visual f/x); ""Game Babes"" explores the emergence of female action stars in cinema, showcasing Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory; ""Corporate Malfeasance"" is a featurette focusing on how the Umbrella Corporation bears real world similarities; ""Symphony of Evil"" is  a special effects montage; ""Poster Gallery"" showcases five submissions from the finalists of the online poster design contest; and there are movie trailers, including the theatrical trailer and teaser for RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE and the trailer for RESIDENT EVIL.",1285372800,,4581,5.150537634408602
2448589,2,B000BYRCR4,"I hate all the reviewers and critics who say that ""fans of the video game are going to love this movie."" These critics normally aren't gamers or fans of the source material, so how can they be an adequate judge of the tastes of gamers? I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil game franchise, the very person these critics believe that will enjoy the Resident Evil films. But I DESPISE these movies. And why, do you ask? Because they really aren't much like the games at all. Oh sure, there's a mansion, zombies, zombie dogs, a ""Licker"" creature, and the malignant Umbrella corporation. But aside from those aesthetical similarities, the film bears little resemblance to the games.

When preproduction of the first Resident Evil film began, the legendary George Romero, whose Dead franchise was a major inspiration for the Resident Evil games, was commissioned to write a script. His script shared many similarities to the game, such as the inclusion of characters like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. However, it also made changes to the story that game developers Capcom didn't like, and Romero was ultimately turned down. Instead, they hired Paul WS Anderson, director of Event Horizon and another video game movie, Mortal Kombat. His treatment was more like a prequel to the games, and this approach was more acceptable to Capcom's head honchos. Anderson's treatment was greenlit, and ""Resident Evil: Ground Zero"" went into production (the ""Ground Zero"" subtitle was abandoned after the events of September 11th).

The film begins in The Hive, a massive laboratory facility beneath Raccoon City. The mutagenic T-Virus is being tested in the labs, but someone releases the virus, infecting the hundreds of scientists within the facility. Sensing the outbreak, The Hive's security system, the artifically-intelligent Red Queen, locks down the facility and douses everyone in halon to further prevent their escape.

We switch to Alice (Milla Jovovich), who awakens in an empty mansion after passing out in the shower. Her collapse has has given her amnesia, a condition that becomes ever more frightening when a team of nameless Special Ops soldiers (see: fodder) employed by Umbrella storms the mansion. Turns out that the mansion serves as a secret entrance to The Hive, and the team has been sent to infiltrate The Hive and investigate its lockdown. The team directs Alice down into the bowels of the facility to assist with the task. Why they can't determine the nature of the lockdown from the outside is beyond me, since that would be a much more logical thing to do. And why can't they just trust the security system they created and leave The Hive locked down, rather than endangering the lives of an entire Special Ops team and potentially the lives of everyone on the outside by reopening the Hive? But as you're going to find out while watching the Resident Evil films, logic does not exist in this dojo.

Anyway, Alice and the team discover that the T-Virus has turned everyone in The Hive into flesh-eating zombies, and they must get out of the facility before it is sealed up  permanently. But seeing the risk of letting them leave, the Red Queen isn't going to make it easy for them.

The Resident Evil games excel at creating a dark, suspenseful atmosphere, where you don't know what horrors are literally waiting around the corner. The main characters are given little ammunition to fend off the hordes of zombies and creatures salivating for their flesh, perpetuating a sense of doom and dread since the player must be methodical and conservative with their weapons. Writer/director Anderson attempts to establish a suspenseful mood by not even introducing the zombies until about halfway through the film. But sadly, all attepted suspense is lost once the flesheaters appear and the Covert Ops team whip out their big machine guns and blast away at them. The film becomes less about mood and scares and more about action and gunfire.

The emphasis on action increases once Alice begins regaining her memory, suddenly remembering that she is a martial arts expert who can run along walls, do flying kicks, and break necks with her thighs. It feels like her sparring partner was Trinity in The Matrix.

In fact, the film cribs a lot of elements from The Matrix Bargain Bin, such as references to Alice in Wonderland (Alice, the Red Queen, the entrance to The Hive is a mirror), wire-fu, slow-motion bullets, and a lead character who suddenly discovers that they have incredible abilities. The film also seems to ""borrow"" elements from other genre films like Cube and Day of the Dead, though it's hard to criticize the game for using elements of Romero's zombie films since the games themselves are inspired by them.

The film also possess a chugging, screeching metal/electronica score composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. No, I'm not kidding. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson assisted in the creation of the film's score. It's actually quite good, even if the combination of the crunching electronic guitars, pounding drum machines, and heavy gunfire could give you a headache by the end of the film.

This film is ""meh"". It isn't great, it isn't good, it isn't god-awful. It's quite derivative of other films it shouldn't be, and it lacks the elements that make the game so great. The acting is...well...there. It's also hard to care about characters who don't even have names. The only reason we know that Milla Jovovich's character is named Alice is because it's in the end credits. Characters are almost never addressed by their names during the film. So you feel almost completely indifferent when half the cast is killed off fairly early in the film. They all feel like nameless, faceless fodder, as bad as any cast of horny teens in any random 80's slasher film.

The highlights? The score and the rather humorous audio commentary of Anderson, Jovovich, producer Jeremy Bolt, and castmate Michelle Rodriguez. Jovovich sounds like she's in full ""valley girl"" mode here, and they joke about everything from Milla's gas (a little T.M.I. if you ask me), their time spent in a German nightclub (the film was shot mostly in Berlin), and cast member Eric Mabius' affinity for yogurt. But it says a lot about a film when one of the major highlights of the film is its audio commentary. After all, you don't watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 because the movies they're riffing on are great.",1280966400,,6427,4.941666666666666
2448590,2,B000BYRCR4,"As far as action flicks go, this one is decent.  It isn't anything spectacular, but it has ample amounts of blood and guts (the cube scene alone is a highlight) and some adrenaline pumping music to make the `zombie killing' entertaining.  In the end the film comes off feeling rather cheap, but it isn't a complete disaster.

Still, having been a fan of the videogames, I must say that this film went a direction I was not expecting and thus proved itself far less than I could have hoped for.

If you are a fan of the videogames, or have at least played them once or twice, you'd know that the whole idea behind this game (and the endless copycats) is to scare you.  You play it locked up in your room in the dead of night and find yourself transported to a place that shocks you.  Every noise makes your heart jump.  That is the exact feeling I wanted from this movie.  `Resident Evil' is not an action/adventure type game.  It is a dark and slowly paced horror game.  That is what this movie needed to be.  It needed to layer on the fear and tension, not the action.  Sure, it's cool to see Milla Jovovich kick some serious zombie butt, but I'd rather have seen her hyperventilate in a dark room while she listened to the corpses dragging their broken limbs across the hall on the other side of the door.

It's my opinion, but I think it is what the videogame warranted.

Taking my personal preference aside, this movie does deliver to a certain extent.  The story it develops is engaging (and the back story does have a certain amount of depth) and they tried hard to layer it with elements from the film, but overall it feels a tad hollow or unimportant.  When it's all over you don't feel like you need to watch it again.  There are far better zombie films out there (Danny Boyle's masterpiece '28 Days Later' is everything this film SHOULD have been).

Jovovich is a stunning piece of eye candy, and I really enjoy watching her breathe, so I was game for this film and its ridiculous sequels.  Still, I wish she were a better actress and I wish she were in better films.",1277856000,,2077,4.375979112271541

2448592,3,B000BYRCR4,"This is the kind of shlock SF/action thing that, regardless of reviews or how bad the ads look, I nearly always have a gut desire to see - and which all too often disappoints.  Having gone into this one 8 years after its release, having studiously avoided it and its sequels and knowing almost nothing about the plot or the game it was based on, I have to say that I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, at least at first.  No, it's not a great film or even a particularly good one, but in the hands of a director who is even remotely competent or interesting, this could have been a solid entry into the action/horror/sc-fi arena.

Unfortunately, the director we have here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who has managed not only to have a fairly productive and lucrative career but also to marry the fabulous Milla Jovovich, his leading lady in this film and the sequels.  The only other PWSA film I've seen is ALIEN VS PREDATOR, and this is certainly a notch above that film, but it still shows plenty of examples of poor editing and narrative construction, dull and ugly action scenes - excepting a couple where Milla gets to kick butt on her own - and fairly obvious and trite horror movie clichs in abundance.

What's good about the film is mostly Milla, who I wouldn't say gives a terrific performance exactly, but who does exude a presence, show some nice physical grace and power, and communicate reasonably well the character of a woman just starting to come out of memory loss - and to realize just how much the mega-corporation that she and nearly everybody else works for has betrayed them all.  She is Alice, apparently a former security professional for the Umbrella Corporation, and she has seemingly lost her memory as a result of some kind of nerve gas.  She awakens in a fancy mansion that turns out to be a secret portal to the underground Hive, a supercomputer that runs nearby Raccoon City and is a breeding ground for all kinds of unorthodox experiments.  Alice has to accompany - and eventually lead - a team of commandos into the Hive to see what's gone wrong with it, and along the way they encounter those most boring (to me) of currently popular horror icons, zombies.  Somehow an anti-aging virus developed in the Hive has this unpleasant zombifying side-effect, and the Hive has killed off all of the scientiests within.  Except, of course, that you can't really kill a zombie.

Like I said, there are some good action scenes with Milla, and there's also a nice sense of claustrophobia at times - it seems like the Hive might go on forever - but on the whole this wasn't any better than ""OK"" for me, and it sure wasn't helped by the dreadful bang-your-head-against-the-wall music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson.  I guess it's what the kids like.  But to be fair, this probably does feel a lot like the videogame - lots of action and blood, paper-thin story and virtually zero in the way of characterizations.

The entertainment value of this film is through the roof (thanks in no small part to the amazingly emotional connection the viewer creates with Alice,) and the scripting is really pretty impressive!

So, why the four stars instead of five? I hate to say this... Special effects. The special effects in this film occasionally take away from the much needed tension (especially the fight towards the end of the film...) It's odd that they chose to CG the monsters in that manner, because it really looked quite dated. Aside from this, fans of the ""Resident Evil"" game franchise will definitely like ""Apocalypse"" best (for all of it's one liners and slo-mo action scenes, it captured the spirit of Racoon City in a way neither of the other films did.)

The Umbrella Corporation needs to know what happened at the Hive and why it was sealed up afterward, so a team is sent down there to open it. Unfortunately, when they do, they unleash an army of the undead and the T-virus is unleashed on the world.

Alice (Milla Jovovich) wanders the streets of Raccoon City, now under quarantine, blasting the heads off of anything dead that moves. Soon she saves Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and crew and the group is quickly contacted by Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) whose daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), is still in the city. Umbrella Corporation scanners show her at the school she attends. The deal: if they save his daughter, he'll guide them out of the city and past the perimeter Umbrella has put up to keep the T-virus in. They have to do this before sunrise otherwise they won't make it out before Umbrella nukes the entire city, erasing any trace that the T-virus existed and reanimated the dead.

Oh, and the Nemesis Project is online, and it's on the hunt.

Usually sequels fail after the first, or if they succeed, it's only by a small margin. Well, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is even better than its predecessor and brings another haul of thrills and chills along with it. In this one the post-apocalyptic feel hangs thick on the air. Raccoon City is in ruins. Cars are overturned and on fire. Bodies and blood litter the streets. Guns are going off in the distance.

And zombies are everywhere. Good and gruesome zombies. (I particularly liked the ones featured in the cemetery; the level of rot and decay on those things was exquisite.)

In Resident Evil style, dark things lurk in the shadows and the suspense and tension built in this movie is awesome. I jumped I don't know how many times. Even the parts where you go, ""Okay, something's going to pop out . . . NOW!"" make you jump. Very cool.

The fight between Nemesis and Alice was cool along with her other wheelings and dealings with the undead. Her super solider-esque, Matrix-like fighting techniques was a treat to watch.

That scene in the school with all those zombie kids? Truly creepy. Adult zombies got nothing on these little terrors.

The movie serves as a nice in-betweener for the first and third. The epic scale of storytelling is terrific, and this is one zombie saga I'm eager to see go on, especially when part four (Resident Evil: Afterlife) comes out in 2011.

When Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up on a shower floor inside a mansion with no memory, she has little time to try and get herself together. Soon the place is infiltrated by commandos, who then take her down beneath the mansion to a secret train and into a place called the Hive, a hidden underground facility where the powerful Umbrella Corporation was conducting secret experiments.

The problem is something had gone wrong before the team got there.

And the dead are coming back to life.

Alice and the commandos dodge zombies, the Hive's super sophisticated security system--called the Red Queen--and teammates who have secrets of their own.

It would be a miracle if anyone makes it out of the Hive . . . alive.

This movie is pure suspense. Every little sound, thump and bump make you wonder when a zombie's going to pop out of nowhere and devour one of the living. Keeping things even creepier is the Hive itself. It's location: a half mile below Raccoon City. Space is limited. Time is running out. You feel the tension all the way through, right from when Alice wakes up till the blood-soaked climax.

I loved this movie. The only reason I'm knocking off half a point is because the plot is super simple (though they make you feel otherwise). However, this flick serves as an awesome back story for what's to come because there have been two sequels so far (Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction) and a fourth one to come in 2011, currently called Resident Evil: Afterlife.

This movie definitely served its purpose of setting things up for the saga to come, and wasted no time going through zombie origin stuff before getting hardcore into the action, mystery and carnage. Director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson nailed it with this film. Though--according to my Mrs--this flick was different than the game, I enjoyed it big time and have been a fan of the franchise since. Guess I owe my wife one for introducing it to me back when this film came out.

Zombie fans will love this movie and it's easy to see why Resident Evil has the following it does.

The city has been quarantined. No one is able to leave or enter. However, the few that have yet been affected by the virus are not without hope as long as they have Alice.

Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice, the zombie butt kicking heroine from the 2002 hit, Resident Evil. She has become stronger and more aware of her abilities. Unfortunately, so has her enemies. Umbrella has released their newest weapon into the city - Nemesis. Nemesis is a hulking abomination that has his eyes set on the S.T.A.R.S team and on Alice.

This movie leaves the confines of the Hive, and takes to the streets of Raccoon City. While the areas are dark and definitely spooky, the suspense is killed by how open they are. One of the biggest draws of Resident Evil was the claustrophobia inducing corridors. The characters never knew what was around the corner, and they had little time to react or maneuver when they found out. You simply never get this feeling with Apocalypse. Suspense has been replaced with action. What you are  left with is a decent action zombie movie with little resembling the Resident Evil tone and mood.

With action playing a greater role, the pacing has quickened quite a bit with frequent explosions, shootouts, and hand to hand combat. I believe more with this movie than any other, Milla secured her title of the ""Female Arnold Schwarzenegger"". She really gives the big guy from Austria a run for his money when it comes to being a kick butt action star.

This is nothing really groundbreaking with the special features - commentaries, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, etc. As usual, the better commentary track comes from the filmmakers rather than the cast.

Picture quality is not bad, but it's not a real looker either. My biggest complaint is with the skewed black levels. It looks a bit bright which hurts the contrast in darker scenes of which 98% of the movie is composed of. Colors are generally good, but nothing really pops. It is disappointing, but not necessarily a deal breaker. Sound quality is excellent. With a good surround sound setup, the groans of the undead will put the hair on the back of your neck at attention.

Overall, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not Resident Evil. The suspenseful mystique of the 2002 film has been lost, and replaced with something that more resembles a summer blockbuster. Fans of the Resident Evil universe will still find enough to keep them entertained, but this movie definitely won't change the minds of those on the fence.

Their latest invention, the T-Virus, promises to reanimate dead bodies. When a vile of this virus is released within Umbrella's underground laboratory known as the Hive, they find out just how potent that concoction is.

The radiant Milla Jovovich takes on the role of Alice, a woman who wakes up on a shower floor, completely unaware how she got there. We follow Alice as she attempts to piece together what is going on. Of course, she has to splatter some undead brains all over the place in search of the truth.

The atmosphere in this movie is spot on. Narrow corridors and flickering florescent bulbs creates an eerie environment reminiscent of the video game series. They also borrowed the extreme high and low angle camera angles from the games. This makes for a tense experience as our heroes move through the halls of the Hive, unsure of what might be around the corner-and have little time or space to react when they find out.

The picture and audio quality is superb. The transfer is leaps and bounds better than the DVD and audio begs for a nice surround sound system. This Blu is easily the best version of the film to date.

The special features are the standard fare of behind the scenes featurettes and commentaries. The commentaries where all the meat of the special features is at. You get two full length commentaries-one with the cast and one with the filmmakers. The cast commentary is entertaining, but not very informative. Milla does the bulk of the talking which some people will love while other will turn it off early on. The filmmakers commentary is very insightful, and the track that I believe most people will prefer. You also get an alternate ending and a Slipknot music video. They are about as interesting as they sound which will be good or bad depending on who you are.

If you are a Zombie fan, you will love this movie. Even more so if you are fan of the video games. However, Resident Evil will not change the minds of those who are turned off by the living dead. The Blu-ray version is definitely worth the upgrade if you are sitting on the fence, DVD in hand.

But aside from that it turned out to be a great movie with  the elements of the game. Alice is a good solid character and reminds me of Angelina Jolie's Lara  Croft  from The Tomb  Rider movies.

The basis of the story was simular with the first games storyline aside from a few slight changes here and there. but All in all it was a exciting  Zombie movie and I  enjoyed it..

Wiether you have played the game or not  I recommened this move",1249776000,2,804,3.9936708860759493

Grade: B-

O.K.--I'll admit it. I stayed away from everything Resident Evil for a while, passing them off as lame movies, unnecessary books, and lack-luster video games. I really don't know what motivated me; it was just something I never bothered with. Boy, was I wrong. Although the first live action film--this one--definitely has it's problems, I am now what you could call, or as close as a living person could get to obsessed with the RE universe.

(Oh, and I'm patiently waiting for the Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles....)

Now back to the movie--yep, you heard me, it has its flaws. Alice is the head of security at a top-secret base miles underground called ""the Hive"", a secret, high-tech facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation. The scientists there specialize in bioengineering and viral weaponry; and one morning their T-Virus, a virus which revitalizes dead cells and has it's side effects, is unleashed on the unsuspecting workers there. Now a team of highly elite trained officers must infiltrate the Hive and find out what went on down there. They stumble upon Alice who can't recall who is she and what she is doing there; they bring her along anyway. They open the Hive, and almost immediately stumble upon the dangers in there...Did I mention the ""side effects"" that may occur are A: death, B: waking up again after dying, due to the virus revitalizing dead cells--there for reviving you, and C: after you wake up, you want to eat something, namely, people. And that means that our people down in the Hive are in serious trouble.

Now of course the actors play it cool, going through the clichd motions, and getting picked off one by one. Milla Jovovich, soon to be seen in A Perfect Getaway, is sort of bland is this movie (although she gets into the grove of her role in Apocalypse and Extinction, giving excellent performances), and doesn't really do much. (Well, aside from doing the Matrix on some wickedly awesome zombie dogs.) Michelle Rodriguez on the other hand seems to always have a dirty look on her face; when she's not shooting zombies, she's busy pouting. All the other actors that had potential die to early in the movie...

That brings us to the special effects: surprisingly varied, they range from awesome (the zombie dogs, which are a mixture of CGI and make-up, are realistic and ferocious), to mediocre--the Licker, a monster that terrorizes the group towards the end of the movie, looks straight out of the video-game, graphics wise. I would say they could have done way better, but the special effects group started work on the Licker late, therefore it wasn't exactly up to par. (They solved this problem in Apocalypse though; they started working on the Lickers during pre-production.) As for the zombies--they have a ton of detail, and it looks like they seriously put some time into them.  After sending the actors to a ""zombie boot camp"", they intricately placed their details, creating effective and creepy zombies.  Bravo to the special effects team on that--you need it after that horrible Licker.

Now I'll also admit--I was going to give this an even lower grade, but decided the positives-negatives canceled each other out. The positive? I loved the ending. Although it too obviously sets up for a sequel, I just loved it. It has a desolate, creepy feel to it, and it kind of assured me that the sequel would be better. The negative? The editor should have been fired. It almost seems as if whole scenes are left out; therefore the movie at times gets highly confusing. For example: Alice and Matt--an environmentalist who befriends Alice--are talking in a room. The next moment they are running from a horde of zombies! How did THAT happen? After examples like this happen at least three times throughout the movie, I got fed up. They should be happy they made the ending so good...

So, in the end, is Resident Evil really the best effort they could have given? The answer is no, but it still has its fun moments. Whether it's seeing the zombie dogs, getting scared by a random loud noise, or seeing elevators kill people in particularly gruesome ways, Resident Evil still packs a (mild) punch.",1249344000,2,6218,6.590464547677262

And it looks like only Alice can stop them.

As with the original Resident Evil, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a monster-mashing, gore-filled zombie flick which is unexpectedly entertaining.

Of course if you're expecting an Oscar-worthy blockbuster here you will be disappointed but if you just want some good ol' mindless movie-watching fun, I recommend Resident Evil: Apocolypse.

2448621,5,B000BYRCR4,"Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.

Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red poster & DVD cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing (not knowing it was ""Resident Evil""). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- something happens, but I don't want to give it away.

That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the DVD. The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.

***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot)

A biological ""accident"" causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive?

***END SPOILER***

POSITIVES:

- As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.

- The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.

- Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.

- The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.

- The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.

NEGATIVES:

- Although ""Resident Evil"" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like ""Aliens"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"". Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, you know anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.

- To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi-horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (like the original ""Planet of the Apes"")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the slaughter comes with the territory.

The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.

PERSONAL GRADE: A-",1227571200,,3054,4.712406015037594
2448622,4,B000BYRCR4,"Ravenous zombies - what more could you ask for on Halloween?  RESIDENT EVIL is chock full of monsters, blood, gore, and actually cool, creative decapitations.  Based on a popular computer game (which I have never played), RESIDENT EVIL is an entertaining monster flick for a cozy evening at home.

RESIDENT EVIL opens with a bang:  something has gone seriously wrong in a secret, underground research facility.  (Isn't that always the case?)  Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down of the facility.  The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory.  A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened.  But things go horribly wrong...

As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun.  It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath.  The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers.  The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun.  The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.

If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL.  My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween.  But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming?  I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen.  It was in the cards.

You have the zombies, demon dogs, etc. as well as a monster who has 'very familiar eyes', but it seems a little dark and shadowy, which seems to rob it of some intensity. It feels more spooky than action packed. Perhaps because they're still stuck in the city fighting in and out of the buildings it just seems too cramped, and too much like the first. I did like it though and it's good enough to stand on its own without watching the first in the series.

2448634,5,B000BYRCR4,"While I felt the first and third movies in this trilogy were entirely average, this second part of the trilogy is nothing short of excellent. Here's why.

This movie breaks the mold of survival horror movies. The usual formula places a group of characters together and kills them off one at a time over the course of the movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, the story progression is much more open ended. We follow the stories of several different groups of characters in different parts of a city sealed off from the outside world to contain the outbreak of a virus. While many characters do die, in this case, it is happpening to unique groups of people all making their own way to survive in a city over-run by zombies. Their storylines eventually converge of course, but the storyboarding developed to bring about this connection is stellar. As icing on the cake, all of these characters feel excellently cast and developed.

There are special effects in this movie, but they do not overpower the realism of human acting. The zombies, and most importantly, the Nemesis monster, are real actors in elaborate costumes and makeup.

The directing and set design are also excellent. This movie feels like a horror movie whereas the other two simply pass as alright action movies. The sets are intricately designed, with the very smallest attention to detail throughout. They are dark, filled with well placed streams of light and shadow, and dirty looking, in direct opposition to the clean, slick nature of the first movie. Everything really feels much closer to what the games envisioned in this outing. The directing is outstanding, filled with inspired camera angels, and the knowledge that true horror does not come from throwing scary beasts at us, but through the unknown about any scenario. The church scene is particularily inspired, giving us only the smallest glimpse of three attackers stalking the characters being portrayed. The level of suspense is masterfully built slowly to a climax around wonderful camera angels and the mood of the set. It is also no wonder why the acting in the movie feels so superb as well. It may not be the stuff of oscars, but it is outstanding by action/horror standards. A great director can bring out the best talent from their actors and actresses. Another classic scene portrays frantic citizens of Racoon city trying to leave through the one exit in the barrier surrounding the city until one man at the front of the line succumbs to infection and the exit is shut tight for good.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an A grade movie, and by far the best of the series. If only all three were this good, and the director of this movie had been brought back for the third installment. It isn't a perfect film, but it is excellent in all the most important places. If you only buy or see one movie out of this trilogy, see this one. It is expertly crafted.",1211414400,2,2896,4.774451097804391
2448635,4,B000BYRCR4,"The movie itself is good, but the to see a zombified children in school was not good.",1210723200,,85,4.0588235294117645
2448636,5,B000BYRCR4,"There's just something about watching a hot babe laying the smack down on anyone and anything that gets in her way - and no one does it better than Milla Jovovich.  She is, to put it mildly, a whole lot of woman.  Resident Evil isn't all about Milla, though; nor is it all about the gore (actually, the movie wasn't nearly as gory as I expected).  Above all, though, Resident Evil is not to be dismissed as just another video game adaptation thrown haphazardly together just to make money.  This film has substance, subplots, and surprises to go along with the generally impressive special effects and, for my money, pretty good acting.  In other words, while the unfortunate denizens of the Hive may be essentially brainless, Resident Evil is not.

I have only limited experience playing the original video game.  I never got very far into it, mainly because I wasn't very adept in the gameplay department and didn't spend the time necessary to significantly improve my minimal skills.  All I remember is exploring the house and trying to kill the occasional zombie that popped up along the way as the music did the principal work of creating a spooky atmosphere.  The movie is much more intense than that - and far more suspenseful.  It's not like some clumsy scientist just happened to drop a beaker, thereby exposing the deadly T-virus all of his geeky colleagues.  On the contrary, this story generates a whole host of questions in the first few moments, questions such as who released the virus and why, but also why is the room housing such a deadly virus tied in to the ventilation system of the whole complex to begin with?  (I can't say I got an answer to that last one.)  I actually had to go back and watch the exposure moment a second time because I thought I had missed something the first time.

Don't expect Milla's character to supply you with any early answers, as Alice wakes up in a ritzy-looking house with no memory of who she is.  Even the shocking jolt of a stranger claiming to be a cop grabbing her just before a team of commandoes suddenly crash through the windows fails to jog her memory, but she doesn't question the special ops commander when he tells her she is one of two security agents stationed in the house to protect that particular entrance to The Hive, the mega-powerful Umbrella corporation's top-secret, underground facility devoted to all kinds of dangerous and illegal research into bioweapons and the like - and that her amnesia is the temporary byproduct of exposure to a nerve gas.  By the time she and the suspicious cop accompany the group to the entrance to The Hive, Alice has met her equally amnesiac ""husband"" and learned that the Red Queen, The Hive's central AI, locked the whole facility down and killed everyone inside in an effort to try and contain the super-deadly T-virus from spreading outside the complex.  Their mission is to get to the Red Queen.  It sounds pretty simple, what with everybody down there being dead and all.  As they soon discover, however, those 500-odd dead bodies have arisen as blood-thirsty, flesh-eating zombies, and the Red Queen isn't going to let anyone into her inner chamber without putting up a fight.

The majority of the movie, to no one's surprise, consists of the team members trying to survive the onslaught of hordes of zombies, high-tech computer defenses of last resort, etc.  As all of that exciting action is taking place, however, we see Alice trying to sort through the memories coming back to her in intermittent waves.  She is a much more central figure in all of this than even she knows early on, and she isn't the only team member with secrets to be revealed.  That leads to some surprisingly effective plot twists that not only advanced the story in important and plausible ways; they were also presented very much in the context of earlier scenes in the movie.

It doesn't matter if you've ever played the video game or not - Resident Evil is just an exciting, action-packed horror film.  I don't consider it to be the least bit scary, but it is quite atmospheric. As a horror fan, I must say I've never counted zombies among my favorite monsters - let's face it, they're basically mindless, slow-footed creatures with no erotic potential whatsoever - so I'm not just whistling Dixie when I say that Resident Evil is a great movie.  Of course, a lot of the credit has to go to Milla Jovovich, the finest of one-woman killing machines.",1210377600,,4446,4.68983268983269
2448637,3,B000BYRCR4,"If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.

This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.

These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descent into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of ""White Rabbit"" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.

In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.

This second film is, in my opinion, marginally better than the first film.  It feels less tied to the strict gameplay narrative that hobbled the first film.  On the other hand, I really didn't like the feel of Raccoon City in it.  It never really came to feel like a real place.  It just felt like a succession of sets, whether indoor or outdoor.  Contrast this with THE MATRIX, where the city of the construct felt much more alive and actual.

I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.",1208563200,2,4438,4.706874189364462
2448638,3,B000BYRCR4,"In the never-ending effort to find new material for movies, the industry has gone to a whole host of new media over the past 2 or 3 decades to include graphic novels, video and computer games, and even theme park rides.  Perhaps not surprisingly game adaptations have been perhaps the least success of all the films based on new sources.  Almost without exception movies based on console or computer games have been unspeakably awful.  RESIDENT EVIL, while not a great movie, nonetheless manages to be perhaps the best that the genre has produced.  It has, moreover, provoked two sequels that are both arguably better than the film that started it off.

I have not played RESIDENT EVIL (apart from RPGs like Dungeon Siege and Elderscrolls and especially MMORPGs like Asheron's Call and World of Warcraft I generally avoid games), so I don't know how closely this film adheres to its storyline, but you constantly feel the restrictions of a highly predetermined story line.  The entire film -- unlike the sequel -- feels as if it is progressing via a formula.

Milla Jovovich has managed to build a career playing strong, heroic women.  The first film most people know her from is THE FIFTH ELEMENT, but she later went on to make THE MESSENGER (about Joan of Arc), also with Luc Besson at the helm (over the course of his career he has constantly made films featuring female action heroes).  She does a creditable job in all three as someone who manages to be heroic despite attempts at the Umbrella Corporation to manipulate her for their own purposes.

This can be a fun movie if gone into with rather low expectations.  There is a low of gore, some pretty tense moments, but not a lot of plot.  As usual in these movies, greedy corporations are ultimately the enemy (something even truer in real life, yet why don't we remember that in real life?).  If taken for what it is -- slick fluff -- it can be enjoyable.  But if you start interrogating the plot and trying to make sense of it, you'll get frustrated quick.

I first saw this several years ago.  At that time the only cast members I knew were Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  On this rescreening I was pleasantly surprised to see Eric Mabius in one of the main roles.  He is best known today as Daniel Meade on UGLY BETTY.  And while he doesn't quite make it into the sequel, his character sorta, kinda does.",1208476800,,2374,4.62291169451074
2448639,5,B000BYRCR4,"Although based on a video game, the movie has an original screenplay which explains the cause of the T-virus outbreak which is the focus of the video game series. You do not need to have played the video game  to watch this film. In fact, the plot is not entirely congruent with the video games series.

The special effects are well done and the eerie score really adds to the atmosphere of the film. The picture quality on Blu-ray is excellent.

The movie is strong enough to stand on its own in the sci-fi/horror genre without any tie-in to its video game ancestry. The sequels; however, are both disappointing when compared to the potential shown in this film with the last film in the series being the better of the two sequels.",1207958400,,732,4.53030303030303

I have this movie on DVD as well. I have an upscaling DVD player. My upscaled DVD version of this movie looks almost exactly the same as the supposed High Definition Blu Ray version using a PS3 on a Sharp Aquos 1080p LCD TV. I don't know the reason behind the lack of fidelity and image clarity, but honestly, except to say you have the Blu Ray version with the rest (I got the 2nd movie for free in that 5 free movies deal), go with upscaled DVD. The sound quality is better on BluRay, but not so much better it warrants buying the Blu Ray over the regular DVD movie.

Heck, I saw it on TV on an HD channel and it looked the same, that is, nothing special.

So it looks ok, but don't expect superb quality, and instead expect a lot of graininess.",1202256000,,949,4.01058201058201
2448643,5,B000BYRCR4,"In ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse,"" Milla Jovovitch once again stars as the renegade security agent from the Umbrella Corporation.  This time around, we know her name - Alice.  In ""Apocalypse,"" the deadly T-virus has escaped from the underground laboratory known as the Hive and threatens to destroy an entire metropolis, Raccoon City.  Alice has been injected with the T-virus and has become a mutated super hero.  She leads a handful of survivors in search of a scientist's lost daughter.  The scientist has promised to airlift them to safety before a nuclear bomb destroys Raccoon City.  Like the original ""Resident Evil,"" this sequel is a science fiction/horror hybrid with non-stop action.  Instead of an underground lab, an entire city has been infected with the T-virus.  There are a thousand more zombies, killer dobermans, and hideoulsy mutated creatures that must be fought by a gorgeous cast of young actors/actresses.  A powerful rock-n-roll score accentuates the numerous action sequences.  While watching this movie, Euro horror fans will think of Lamberto Bava's ""Demons"" and ""Demons 2"" in which everyone is turning into hideous demons in lieu of zombies.  Favorite scene in ""Apocalypse:""  When Alice crashes her motorcycle through a church's stained glass windown and battles the mutated creatures.  A very strong sequel that rivals the original, ""Apocalypse"" is an apocalyptic disaster movie.  If you own the original, you must own ""Apocalypse.""",1201651200,,1459,5.393805309734513
2448644,5,B000BYRCR4,"""Resident Evil"" is a great science fiction/horror hybrid.  The plot, a virus released from a laboratory, is frightening and plausible.  A beautiful cast, led by a multi-talented Milla Jovovich, comprises a group of paramilitary commandoes who find themselves trapped miles beneath the earth's surface in a secret laboratory where illegal genetic experiments are being conducted by the Umbrella Corporation.  It is a ""who-will-live-who-will-die"" action adventure.  Flesh-eating zombies are not usually my cup of tea but this movie makes them very plausible.  The Red Queen computer is chilling, especially when her voice and hologram are that of a child issuing threats such as ""You're All Going to Die Down Here!""  With the advent of avian flu, the movie's T-virus has frightening possibilities.  Thus, the movie remains current and fresh.  It is reminiscent of ""The Stand,"" ""Rabid,"" ""The Crazies,"" and other out-of-control virus movies.  Favorite scene:  When the Red Queen traps four commandoes in a glass corridor and dispatches them with lasers that slice and dice.  A must have for all fans of science fiction/horror.

Despite (or perhaps because of?) such low expectations, the movie was remarkably well done.  The twists and turns of the plot were interesting, and not 100% predictable.  There was advancement of the broader story line of the t-virus:  A bioweapon that happens to turn the infected into flesh eating zombies.  Sounds simplistic?  Well, the story has more to it than that.

Even from a non-zombie afficianado, it was a sequel worth watching.  Not a Casblanca classic, but perhaps in 20 years this will still be watched as a cult classic.",1201392000,,684,4.737288135593221

If you do, I recommend this.  Anyhow, what I'm concerned with here is the video quality and, to a lesser extent, the audio quality.  Both are excellent; however, I'm irritated by Sony's stubborn use of MPEG-2 transcoding rather than Microsoft's VC-1.  Both Sony Blu-Ray's that I own (Casino Royale and RE: Apocalypse) use MPEG-2 compression; so, I assume that Sony just doesn't want anything to do with Microsoft (See: HD format war).

Honestly, the DVD transfer of this film is top notch for that medium; so, unless you don't own RE: Apocalypse, I wouldn't recommend snagging this one unless you just HAVE to have it in 1080p.

2448671,3,B000BYRCR4,"When I first rented the original ""Resident Evil"" I was completely shocked at how much I liked it.  I had zero expectations for it, yet was sucked in by it's story, characters and visualisation.  So I ran out and purchased it (as soon as it was on sale).  Since then I've watched it about 10 times, which is pretty remarkable considering I have roughly 350 DVDs to choose from.  Given this, as a non-gamer, I was surprised to find that gamers were generally disappointed in this movie (not all of them, but most negative reviews were from gamers).

Now we have ""Resident Evil- Apocalypse"".  Don't get to see ""grown-up"" movies at the theater, so I had to wait until the DVD release.  I liked the first so much, I did not even think of renting this.  I quickly bought the DVD (when it went on sale, never buy at full price)with much anticipation.  Roughly 3 years later I have viewed it approximately (well, ACTUALLY)1 time.  That's right, no type-o.  JUST ONCE.  It was not nearly as compelling as the first film (to me).  Gone was the gripping story, the great camera work, the excellent character development.  In the stead of this great stuff was some sort of ""made-for-cable"" goofy monster movie.  Now, I did not hate it, (I actually like goofy monster movies) but it is not begging me to watch it again.  It's so in-your-face that after one viewing, there was nothing left to see.  No mystery.  No subtlety.  No sense of future dread. It was done.

But wow!  Gamers really like it!!  Now it all makes sense.  Since I find shooter games extremely redundant and difficult to play more than once, I found this movie to be the same.  A one timer (OK maybe 2). Kind of like sixth sense.  Once you get to the end, well..  ...it's over.

Cinematically, comparing this to the first film is like comparing the first ""Star Wars"" to the last (I'm talking release dates, not ""Lucas-Time"").  It's comparing something that is a carfully thought out and woven tale, to something that is simply a series of events strung together to make a story.  Kind of like Shooter video games.  You travel down a linear path and take on what's in front of you.  Unfortunatly this is a film!

I can't say don't buy this if you liked the first.  It's nice to have a continuation of the first.  Just don't go in with the same expectations.",1177632000,3,2311,4.502415458937198
2448672,4,B000BYRCR4,"I really liked this movie. The sets were excellent, the acting decent, the action very good. I never played the game so I came into it totally unbiased. This is definately on my top ten list of movies to watch on cold winter days when I'm able to curl up in front of the tv and enjoy myself.

You've already got the basic story line from other folks and apparently this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' type. Maybe if you can see the movie while putting aside the game you'll have a better time. Just sit back and enjoy the story and the action. You'll do just fine.",1176681600,3,561,4.1
2448673,5,B000BYRCR4,"""Resident Evil"" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparant deaths of hundreds of employees;  at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandoes.  Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the ""Resident Evil"" series of video games.

  With ""Resident Evil"", it was far from a given that it could make such a good transition into a movie, to me at least.  It's not like ""Silent Hill"" (which has also generated an excellent movie) or ""Fatal Frame"" (which I'm still waiting for the movie version of), both of which had lots of identifiable movie potential from the beginning.  The ""Resident Evil"" games are a bit different, almost nonstop action, most of them not as developed along character or story purposes (these aspects have begun growing in some of the more recent Resident games).  They needed to fill in some areas for the movie to be as good as the games.  Most of the games pit S.T.A.R. (a highly trained law enforcement organization) agents against hordes of ravenous zombies, occasionally teaming the S.T.A.R. agents with other characters.  It's made a lot of great games, but could it move into just as great a movie?  One thing they did was split the focus up among more characters of different backgrounds - you've got the S.T.A.R. team, you've got the amnesiac Alice - whose nature is kept a mystery until near the movie's end) - as a main point-of-view character, there are the Umbrella (the name of the corporation that owns the underground facility) people and you've got another major character coming into it from outside the main 'groups'.  (This trend of character diversifaction has continued with the ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" sequel, and some of the more recent entries to the game line)  It takes longer to build into where the zombie carnage really starts flying, which is fitting for the first entry of a movie series. It introduces the elements at a pace that's equally good for longtime fans of the games and books as well as for viewers who've never even heard of the concept.  All in all, the transition was more successful than I thought it could be - this is a great, hi-octane horror-action movie which succeeds in establishing good characters and a great 'edge-of-catacylsm' air.  The ending flows directly into ""Apocalypse""; and a third ""Resident Evil"" movie is coming in Fall 2007.

Here are some reasons I found to like it:

1. Sinister corporate paranoia - The idea that things could go terribly wrong when the activities of large, greedy corporations are left unchecked is not exactly far-fetched. The creepy goings on at the Umbrella Corp present a currently relevent scenario.

2. Hot chicks - Milla & Michelle are worth watching anytime; but especially when they do the tough-girl thing.

  Milla looks particularly nice when semi-nude.

3. Delivers the goods - When it comes time for action, suspence & zombie attacks, this flick is fun.

4. Industrial setting - If you like that asthetic, lots of cement and steel for you. Industrial music too!

 While not going down in history as a genre classic ( it's not doing anything inventive or original ), it's actually a pretty good time for the monster movie crowd. What it lacks for in substance, it makes up for in atmosphere, brisk pacing and visceral thrills.",1166054400,4,1033,4.785310734463277

There are many times in this film that make references to the games. It was fun watching and saying, ""Oh that was on Code Veronica!"" for example.

At first, it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie, but Milla Jovovich is great as the heroine Alice.

The special effects were really good for this movie. The licker and the dogs were really impressive. The action is also very entertaining. When the action is happening, I find myself not being able to turn away, it is very fast paced. I also really enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the team.

I saw the first one and completely enjoyed it from start to finish. With this one I wasn't sure if they were trying to not spend as much money and give a few cheap shots during the action. I am not sure if anyone else notices the changes in the lens in way like what was done in moments in Collateral damage. If you wish to explain why they do this by all means please write me a comment. Where the action was done with normal shots I enjoyed each and every stunt, shot, and explosion. Overall the acting was decent just what is needed in an action movie, but all I have to do is remind myself that I am not watching it for academy preformances. Overall I did enjoy the movie even with my personal annoyance at the shots, I was glad about the stunning ending that they left us with. one more important note I left in my head as I watched the movie, a note that everyone should leave in their head... that in a series the second movie is the bridge between the first movie to the third one so basically go easier on it, it did it's job succesfully and I will be going to the theatres once again to see the third and adding to my shelf once it is released.",1159142400,4,1307,4.129411764705883

There are some good action sequences (I have a soft spot for seeing zombies getting kung-fu'ed out of their socks, okay?) and some over the top mid-air explosions and such which bring down the interest some, but of course the big element played in this sequel, much like the original, is the intrigue of the plans of Umbrella.

For those of us who have played the RE games, this movie provided a nice background, a sort of prequel and more depth to what was going on in the game and the reasons behind it. For anyone who hasn't played the video game, this movie is an excellent stand-alone horror sci-fi flick that is sure to become a classic and that does a good job of keeping your eyes glued to the screen and your heart thumping while you wonder what the poor characters will have to face next.

2448690,1,B000BYRCR4,"After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel. Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job.

RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.

I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses.

In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year. Somebody would literally have to pay me to see it!",1156982400,8,1410,4.478599221789883

Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didn't even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.

When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didn't even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title.

This movie is full of scary parts and humorous moments and great action sequences that trust me you will never forget. I was a little disappointed though on how this movie was not as scary and sinister as the first But many people jumped at many various parts of the movie including me.

Alot people have been talking about the zombies lately. I would have to say they were not scary...they seemed to be alot weaker as if you could push them over. I took it as kind of a joke and sometimes it makes you want to take pictures of the zombies then laugh later. But new creatures have emerged and are even more sinister like the ""Nemesis"" and the ""licker"".

Second the addition of ""Jill Valentine"" was simply very intelligent but you did not get to see her in full action. She was a little too much of the ""sidekick"" but you do see her kicking zombie [...]!!!

Well, yes it is.  And I like both.  In the Claim, a retelling of Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, you see MJ give a performance that should of at least netted her an academy award nomination (and she can sing!).  But the Academy, being the sink hole it now is, ignored that wonderful movie and the performances in it.  Fast forward things a few years, and Milla is kicking tail in better than Tomb Raider style.  A business decision on MJ's part?  Who knows?  But Hollywood can be cruel to women as they age.  For my money, it's clear MJ can do anything, and if B-movie Superchick is her choice, then enjoy the ride.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the kind of movie that critics hate, and movie goers love.  It's fast, it's furious, and don't try to make much sense of it (Example: the motorcycle crashing through the church window.  But hey!  It LOOKED great!).  Devil dogs, zombies (very lame ones, who fail the Romero zombie shuffle test), evil corporate scientists, and a band of heros out to save a little girl.  That's all you probably need to know.

2448703,4,B000BYRCR4,"I'm not really a fan of the comic book or video game based movies, however, ""Resident Evil"" is one thrilling movie.  The story line is well put together and original for the most part (ok, so there are zombies, past that though...)

The sequel to ""Resident Evil"" I think makes this movie even better and you should definately watch both, in order.  While Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigues might be type-cast, they certainly deliever when it counts.

Those who play and know the video game I'm sure will like the movie even more then the uniniated such as myself, but do not let that stop you from see this surprisingly good movie.",1149292800,3,634,4.633928571428571
2448704,3,B000BYRCR4,"I dunno quite how you should rate this movie.  Certainly, it is bad, but it is also amusing.  3 stars and a C seems fair, I suppose.  Anyway, It's really quite a sight. You don't often see movies in this day and age with this kinda of budget that is as flatly goofy as 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.  The original RE film was stupid, yes, but it really wasn't in the same league as this one in terms of sheer wackiness. (To the best of my recollection, anyway. It's been quite a while...)  Still, you've gotta give RE: Apocalypse this: It's gotta whole helluva lotta action.  It's quite nonstop the first like 2/3 of the movie, though it actually slows down some towards the end. It actually gets a little dull for a while, but the final fights, particularly the outrageous kung-fu battle between Alice and Nemesis are sufficiently hilarious as to get the movie back on track, or at least as on track as it ever was.

Anyway, this one takes place directly after the original, with the zombies and various other monster having escaped the Hive and laying waste to Raccoon City (It's adorable that they kept that name, by the way.)  It is shortly sealed off by the Evil B*stards in charge of Umbrella.  Also, there's a scientist dude who invented the T-Virus and isn't quite as evil and he wants to get his daughter out out, and there's Nemesis whose been let loose in the city and he's a jerk, and Alice is there too and a bunch of STARS people and a reporter and also this jive-talking black dude who is quite likely to offend those who are won't to be offended by things and blah blah blah.  Anyway, they've got to run around and yell and shoot a lot of zombies and lickers and some zombie dogs whatnot.  And so they do.

To give credit where credit is due, the set design and art direction in this film are generally quite excellent.  I particularly like the large church/cathedral they take refuge in.  However, the cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired. It's trying to be hypermodern and flashy but it's mostly just chintzy.  I'm not really opposed to this kinda thing in and of itself, but it's easy to screw it up, and that's what they've done here.  The action scenes aren't exciting, but they do have a sorta goofy energy to them that makes them fun.  Also, the film is never in the least bit scary, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for zombies.  These ain't the greatest zombies ever, but they work.  However, the film is utterly devoid of gore, which is quite aggravating and unforgivable.  We don't even get any notable close-ups of zombies getting their brains blasted out, and you need like a bare minimum of 15 of those in your zombie movie. (You could perhaps go a bit lower here, as shooting them in the head isn't necessary, but there need to be a lot more than none of them, anyway.)

Performances are generally either comical or flat.  Milla Jovovich is quite dull and really not all that attractive as our crazy semi-mutant hero Alice.  Sienna Guillory is our second major protagonist, Jill Valentine, and is better than Milla, or better looking anyway, which is what mostly counts in this kinda movie.  As you probably already know, they dress her as Jill was dressed in RE3,(i.e. tube top and mini skirt) which amuses me to no end.  This does not strike as the most practical battle outfit, but she didn't really have time to prepare, I guess, and she does look pretty damn hot, so I'm not complaining.  Also in attendance is some dude playing Carlos.  I do not remember a single thing about him, apart from one utterly hilarious line of dialogue.  There's also this Nickolai dude.  He's pretty cool. He's my favorite character, in fact, but he hasn't got that much screen time, sadly.

As if I haven't made this clear yet, this is definitely a good-bad movie.  I wasn't quite laughing at it, but I was smirking, continually, which is about the same thing.  I had a good time watching it, what can I say. Wouldn't mind watching it again some day.  It gives me hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.  They've headed in a bad direction as of late, with 'Silent Hill' and 'Doom' being stupidly boring rather than stupidly watchable.  RE:Apocalypse gives us the real goods, at least as far as this kinda movie goes.

Also, it does have perhaps the greatest line in all of film.  Some STARS dudes are discussing how, after they've been left in Raccoon City, they don't matter to the corporation and they're expendable and then Carlos (I believe) says: 'We've just been expended.'  HA!!!!!!!!!  That is frickin' hilarious.  I believe the proper term would be spent.  Anyway, an entertaining movie.

2448705,3,B000BYRCR4,"After getting dogged by many Resident Evil fans about the 1st film not being truly true to the game, Anderson decides to make the sequel more closer to the game's sequels. Didn't do a very good job of doing that.

The fools from Umbrella Corp. unleash the dead in the hive, and now the T-Virus is spreading through out Raccoon City. Citizens cannot leave the city, and now are trapped with the walking dead.

Jovovich returns as the dull and boring Alice, who now has super powers like a fake ass Albert Wesker wannabee from Code Veronica X. Along trapped in Raccoon City is Jill Valentine (Guillory), a reporter (Holt), 2 Umbrella soldiers (Fehr, Ward), a citizen (Epps) and a few others I don't care mentioning.

On their tales is a killing maching called Nemesis (Taylor). Once again, no gore, dull characters, and boring Alice taking away the spoylight from real characters from the game. Nemesis is a weak sissy in this film, and he looks cheesey. Nicholai in the game is a old and evil man. In this movie, Nicholai is a young man on the good guys' side.

The slow-motion scenes of the zombies' walking looks stupid, and once again, these zombies are pitiful. This film does have a few good scenes, good fight scenes, and the ending isn't bad. However, it's just like the first film...disappointing.

Resident Evil really needs to be redone soon. And when I mean redone, I mean no Anderson, no Screen Gems, and no Alice. At least these Resident Evil films are good for one thing...they entertain.",1146182400,,1501,4.670454545454546
2448706,3,B000BYRCR4,"Since I am a fan of the game, I see all the many flaws in this fake version of a film pretending to be Resident Evil. When I heard that Anderson was writing and directing this film, I thought it could be close to the game since he did a good job directing Mortal Kombat, and did a good job writing Shopping. But when I heard that none of the charcters or much of the game's elements are not in this film, I knew trouble was ahead.

Milla Jovovich playes Alice, an employee of Umbrella Corp. who doesn't remember anything after being exposed to knockout gas. She goes with soldiers to the hive that's under the mansion. When they get there, all the workers in the hive are dead. While trying to turn off the Red Queen, the dead workers become undead because of the T-Virus that gets loose in the hive.

The characters in this film are dull and boring. Rain (Rodriquez) and J.D. (Aleardi) are nothing more than a Vasquez and Drake ripoff from Aliens. The gore is so PG-13,this film is onlt ""R"" for language and the little nudity.

This film was the beginning of Anderson being a liar. He lied about a much gorier version coming on DVD. No version of that came out. However, he did told the truth in Fangoria issue #211 about the script of this film is just a homage to the game he wrote before he got the job. That would explain why it's really nothing like the game.

Another lie from him is that he says it's based before the mansion situation in the original game. Well, if that's true, where's Rebecca, Forest, Kenneth and a few other that were in that mansion before S.T.A.R.S. arrived?

Resident Evil does have good visuals, some good scenes, and a very cool score by Marilyn Manson. This film doesn't bore, doesn't make you go to sleep, doesn't make you look at your watch, but it's not a Resident Evil film. All we're watching is the script Anderson wrote that was turned into Resident Evil. He should've just released the film like that.",1146182400,,1944,4.403899721448468

2448710,2,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil 2 has much of the same qualities as the first film did.  For instance, both films cut right into the story with little background, and the two films end just as precipitously.

However, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start.

Oh yeah, also while at the end of the first film, we see a guy ripped away to be used for some experiment and we the audience actually are upset; but, in the second film the tenderness for this man-turned-mutant is never developed enough for us to care, and I mean at all.

Other then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.  Oh well though, I am only a reviewer and regrettably cannot actually tell directors what to make and what not to make.  (It's probably better this way)",1142380800,2,1474,4.670542635658915
2448711,1,B000BYRCR4,"Following the moderate success of the first ""eh, good enough"" film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse continues the story of Alice, one of the few survivors of the T-Virus outbreak that turned the Hive facility's employees into flesh-eating zombies. The Umbrella Corporation has reopened the Hive and the T-Virus has escaped into the Raccoon City above it. Now, Alice - who is now superpowered thanks to Umbrella tinkering with her DNA - must once again escape hordes of zombies, hellhounds, and Umbrella-created mutations before the whole city is nuked off the map.

With her this time are characters that are actually from the games the movie is based on - sexy cop Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr). Since the Alice character was inspired by the Jill character, they are almost exactly the same atttude-wise, and do we really need two of the same character in the same movie? Sorry, we don't. The movie is supposed to take place during the Resident Evil 3 game which Jill is the star of, but whenever Jill gets in trouble in this film, Alice swoops in like Supergirl and saves her ass. They totally waste the Jill character just to keep the awful Alice story going, and it's sad to see the character that stars in the game get upstaged left and right by a character that was never in the games. Booooo! Maybe they should have just left the game's characters out of this film so they could keep the film and game separate.

This brings up the problems with the story. Since Alice wasn't in any of the games and this film is supposed to be about the third Resident Evil game, this puts the film in the ""it's kind like but kinda not like the game"" category, so you don't even know where it exists in the canon of the games' storyline. Second, some of the plot points are incredibly stupid from the start. After all, why would a corporation design a research facility with a special security system designed to seal the place off should something disasterous happen and then try to reopen the facility not once but TWICE once something so bad happens that the place needs to be sealed off? Couldn't they take the hint the first time they reopened the place and lost an entire Special Ops team inside? And wasn't the guy that escaped that was infected with their T-Virus enough of a hint that there had been a T-Virus outbreak? The logic that sets this film in motion is so annoyingly flawed. You'd think a major coporation like Umbrella was smarter than this. They could have at least tried to explain it off that the Hive was reopened with the purpose of letting the T-Virus escape to see how effective their bio-weapon was in a major city? That's one of the explanations they give in the game, but they don't even do that in the film.

Second, why are they giving Alice more and more powers? How are we supposed to relate to her? Part of the appeal of zombie films - or most films in general - is that you can relate to the characters. You can mentally put yourself in their position, and you worry about their well-being. But what happens when the character you're supposed to relate to becomes so powerful they can do somersaults, know tons of martial arts out of the blue, and can kill people with telepathy? Alice becomes so powerful and superhuman, you never fear she won't survive. It's called the Superman Syndrome - a character becomes so powerful, that you don't care what happens to them because you already know.

Now there's the Nemesis. They turn a badass killing machine into a good guy in the end! Part of what makes some villains so fun is that they're so bad - they're so bad, they're good. That was part of the appeal of Nemesis. But instead, they turn him into a kinder, gentler Nemesis who saves the day in the end.

The Resident Evil movies are supposed to be zombie movies, but they're made into action/sci-fi bullcrap. Sure, zombie films have some action in them, but it's more realistic action. Sadly, these films use stylized action that look like they were taken from the Matrix Bargain Bin with its slow motion bullets, wire-fu, and choppy editing to try making the film look ""cool"". And they fail miserably. Zombie films make the action secondary, but this is an action film and the zombies are secondary.

The first film spent half its running time zombie-free, as they tried to set up suspense and that's pretty understandable. This time around, there should be zombies galore, right? But the plotting is so damn slow, you almost forget there are zombies in the film! And even when the zombies are on-screen, they use this filming style that looks like choppy stop-motion animation! Who thought this was a good idea in post-production? Whoever has this film editor hired now on ANY film, fire them immediately.

UPDATE - This visual characteristic is called ""dropping frames,"" and it usually occurs accicentally during editing when transferring footage from film to digital editing software. When the software is having trouble converting one of the frames the footage for whatever reason, that frame is ""dropped"". The blur yousee is the footage skipping over the missing frame. It happens rarely, and when it does happen, it's either barely noticeable to the audience , or it requires the editor to make adjustments or find a different method to convert the footage. But in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it appears that the editor is intentionally dropping frames to create this visual effect. Why? Is there something wrong with the zombies that they have to obscure the audience's view of them? Do they think (erroneously) that it makes the zombies scarier? Or are the zombies too visually disturbing that they have to be blurred in order to make an R rating?  Whatever the reason, this is a TERRIBLE visual characteristic, and whoever masterminded this decision needs to go back to college and take a few film classes.

I'm sorry, the LJ character is so blatantly offensive. Do we really need the loud-mouthed black comic relief these days? The only way this would have been more offensive and cliched is if they had some Vaudeville-esque performer in blackface tap-dancing and eating watermelon throughout the film.

And I'm certain that the only reason they made it possible to kill the zombies by snapping their necks was to tone down the gore and get it past the MPAA with an R rating, not to mention that video games still have the ""just kid's stuff"" reputation, and thus movies based on video games suffer a similar stigma so they have to be toned down for ""the kids."" But this is supposed to be a ZOMBIE FILM, it's supposed to be gory! The games, which are supposedly ""just kid's stuff,"" actually have MORE gore than the movies made about them. So as far as zombie films go, the Resident Evil films are pretty tame. Hell, they could have gone with more gore, taken it out so the film could get an R, then put it back in for an Unrated Version on DVD. That would have been more acceptable than these zombie film abominations.

And am I the only one who is so tired of the blue tint they see in every action/sci-fi film since The Matrix? I haven't been to a single city where the lighting is blue EVERYWHERE at night. Enough with the blue lighting, damn it.

Believe me, if I could have given this film 0 Stars, I would have. This is truly a horrible film. Horrible-looking, horribly-written, horribly-directed, and so on. It's such a shame that video games are being so poorly represented on film this way.",1142121600,9,7476,4.668185269552012

It's almost like the filmakers were constantly trying to outdo themselves. Granted, the costumes are very well done, the characters look like the characters, but there are just too many ridiculous searching scenes and dull lines like ' try to shoot em in the head' and the classic ' who the f are you?'

2448717,4,B000BYRCR4,"In 2002, audiences and critics alike were surprised by the success of the video game inspired hit ""Resident Evil"".  Though critics and even some moviegoers didn't feel the movie was worthy of receiving a sequel, even though the ending was left wide open and a sequel was needed for some sort of resolution to the story, the studio execs were clearly listening to those that enjoyed the movie and decided to buck the critics and released ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"".  The same people that despised the first film were bashing the release of its sequel with just as much passion; however, upon it's release the film managed to silence many of its attackers.  Not settling for merely making a sequel for money alone, writer Paul W. S. Anderson (the writer/director of ""Resident Evil"") crafted an even bigger, better, and more action packed thriller for the follow-up, and succinctly silenced the nay-sayers with a sequel that ties up all loose ends from the original film, serving as an excellent addition to a budding franchise.

""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" begins directly where ""Resident Evil"" left off, starting with a flashback sequence that serves as a refresher course for the audience so that all are on the same page when the action really gets going.  Surviving the zombie attacks in the underground compound of the Umbrella Corporation, Alice (Milla Jovovich) arrives in Raccoon City, located right next to the compound, and discovers that she is too late.  The entire city has apparently been overrun by zombies, with most of the city in ruins, Alice begins searching for any non-infected survivors.  She finds a few companions that are willing to take the fight to the zombies, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), well-armed and ready for action these compatriots set out to rid Raccoon City of the evil unleashed by Umbrella Corporation.  However, Umbrella Corp. has a surprise for our heroes, a nasty mutated form of zombie known as Nemesis.  With supplies becoming drastically limited, it appears that time is running out for our heroes, and humanity's days could be numbered.

As I stated earlier, ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" is simply a better film than its predeccesor, in terms of acting, storytelling, pacing, and action.  To be fair, ""Resident Evil"" is merely the opening chapter to this much bigger story that is told in ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"", and in truth, neither of the two films hold up on their own.  Director Alexander Witt brings his valuable experience as a much respected 2nd Unit Director from his previous film experiences, ""Gladiator"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" to name a couple, giving the material a more mature, polished appearance that the original film lacked.  The special effects, including the practical and make-up effects, are all improved in ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"".  A very good decision was made in having the Nemesis monster not be just another CGI character, but be a physical man in a suit, it is with the Nemesis character that the make-up and practical effects team really shined.  The acting and storytelling were much improved from the original film, and the addition of Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera from the video games was an especially nice touch.

Overall, ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" is a very solid, zombie thriller that doesn't stand up well on it's own, but when coupled with the first film, the two make for a very entertaining thrill ride of zombie mayhem.

""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.",1139356800,3,3544,5.070689655172414
2448718,4,B000BYRCR4,"Video games have been entertaining kids, teenagers, and adults consistently for about the last 25 years.  From Pong to Madden, Pac-Man to Tomb Raider, there is not a single doubt in anyone's mind that though most games have been created for entertainment purposes only, and that the graphics have significantly improved through every generation of gaming.  There are some games that standout from the rest in terms of almost movie quality experience within the game, from intense stories, stunningly realistic graphics, and for the most part solid voice acting, many of today's video game franchises have felt like they are movies that players have full control over.  Such franchises are extremely successful, some examples would be; `Silent Hill 1-4', all of the `Tomb Raider' games, and the controversial `Grand Theft Auto' franchise.  One of the most popular video games with that cinematic quality would have to be the `Resident Evil' series.  With its eerie and creepy storyline and music, dark and dangerous environments that are loaded with evil zombies waiting to kill you, and the great voice-over actors used to bring your favorite characters to life, it is clear why this franchise is one of the strongest franchises to this day, even after having 3 sequels and a prequel game released in the series.  Many of these video game franchises have been so successful that even Hollywood has begun to take notice, recent Hollywood movies based on video game franchises have been pretty much hit-and-miss in terms of loyalty to the source material and interest from the general movie-going public.  The failures would have to be ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"", ""Alone In the Dark"", ""Mortal Kombat"", and ""Bloodrayne"", the successes have basically been between two franchises the `Tomb Raider' franchise starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Tomb Raider:  The Cradle of Life"", and the Milla Jovovich thrillers ""Resident Evil"" and ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"".  It just so happens that this review is for ""Resident Evil"", look for future reviews to feature my opinions on both the good and bad adaptations.

""Resident Evil"" begins with a paramilitary commando team invading a house that appears to be mostly vacant except for a strange woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich).  Upon further searching of the grounds, it appears that all is not as it seems, and that this house is really a cover for a secret underground facility set up by the evil Umbrella Corporation.  Though Alice doesn't recall what has happened in the recent days, except for the bits and pieces she receives via flashbacks, she quickly begins to understand that there is definitely something awry with this facility.  A fact that is proven to be correct by the existence of zombies that have begun hunting the paramilitary team.  As if the zombies weren't enough to contend with, it seems that the facility's defense mechanism has been activated and the facility itself is hunting the commandos.  Now, all are in a race for their lives to escape the facility without letting any of the zombies make it to the surface.

Writer/Director Paul W. S. Anderson really had his work cut out for him when releasing this movie.  With previous video game adaptations failing at the box office, many movie-goers and critics were highly skeptical that any video game franchise could translate well onto the big screen.  Understanding that his biggest asset would be to not assume that everyone knows the source material, i.e. the video game, Anderson crafted a story that stays true to the video games, even feels like it could have come from any of the video game installments, yet also stands on it's own as a separate creation.  The actors are all very talented, and all give solid, realistic performances that serve to raise the movie up from being a simple video game adaptation and/or zombie movie into a truly suspenseful thrill-ride that doesn't require any knowledge of the source material so that all movie audiences can walk right into the theater and be on the same page in terms of what's occuring in the movie.  The special effects work for the most part is very well done, a few scenes are a little weak, but I understand that the studio might not want to risk breaking the bank on a video game franchise that isn't a guaranteed success at the box office.

Though I enjoyed ""Resident Evil"", I must admit that upon my first viewing of the movie I wasn't as enthralled by it.  This has mostly to do with the fact that there is a wide open ending to the movie, there is some resolution, but for the most part the story is left open and screaming for a sequel.  Since I saw the movie within a few weeks of its arrival on DVD, there had not been any announcement made regarding a future sequel.  Without a sequel the story is incomplete, and therefore a let down.  However a year later Columbia Pictures announced that they had begun production on ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" and that the basic story written again by Paul W. S. Anderson, would pick up directly where ""Resident Evil"" left off.  Needless to say, this made me happy and so when the sequel came out on DVD I rented both movies and watched them back to back.  By doing this I was treated to a complete story that is truly too big to fit into one movie and the need for two movies to tell one story made sense, and I was no longer frustrated with the first film.  With all that being said, if you are wanting to watch ""Resident Evil"", please keep in mind that you need to rent the sequel at the same time or shortly after viewing the first film so that you will get the complete movie experience as it was intended to be.

""Resident Evil"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.",1139184000,2,5752,4.791497975708502

I didn't even get a shiver.  The film is done as a action film, not a thriller so don't expect to piss your pants in fear.  The action scenes are decent and the gore level is up there...some of the CGI is a little corny but Jovovich is enough to make you forgive the defects of the film.  It's fun and entertaining while not living up to the hype I placed on it.  I give it four stars because for what it is, an action film with a beautiful star, it pulls through.  It just doesn't have the same feel the video game has...it doesn't do the game justice in that respect.

The Dislikes which made me give it a 3/5 is becuase of the music and action scenes. The action scenes seemed terrible, the combat moves to be exact. if they tried harder on the combat moves it would have made it seem more interesting. The music! They could have done better! It was the worst ever, they played music at the wrong times, music that didn't even belong with the scenes! Also what dissapointed me was that one character, that ""funny"" one, they should have left him out, i never found any lines of his funny and its suppose to be a thriller/ Sci Fi film, not a comedy film. But unfortionetly hes going to be in the 3rd movie also, i forgot what it was called. THe nemisis should have been kept till the 3rd movie, but remember readers!

This is one of those love-it or hate-it movies.  I loved it.  This is one of the best game-based movies out there.  Sure, the zombie thread is standard fare (a virus causes a zombie plague and a group of people fight to survive), but there are good special effects.

The movie is very fast-paced, mindless and filled with action, good sound effects and soundtrack.  Not surprisingly, this movie is quite violent and depicts a lot of gore.

2448726,5,B000BYRCR4,"I recently purchased Resident Evil: Deluxe Edition from Amazon.com. Having never seen this film before, I realized that I played a gamble with this DVD. However, I think I did alright.

For 11.49, you really can't go wrong. This film features non-stop action, suspense, and a semi-decent plot to go with the flow of the film. Mind you, the plot has the structural integrity of a block of swiss cheese. But, bear in mind that Resident Evil is not a film that was made with the intention of getting nominated for an Academy Award.

Movies of this genre require only 2 things:

1) A beautiful female lead who knows martial arts and can manipulate a 9mm with the finesse of a Parisian street artist (that is a compliment).

2) Lots of on-screen death and destruction. Resident Evil is chock-full of ""#2"". Zombies are shot at, kicked at, punched at, and even head-butted at one point I think.

Grab the popcorn and Coke. Dim the lights, and turn up the sound. For 12 dollars, I do not think you will be disappointed.

5 solid stars. Not for quality, but for pure entertainment value. Do NOT expect deep, thought-provoking dialogue, and thematic material from this film.

The dialogues are bad and the performance terrible; why make Alice look tough in the film? And the zombies almost doesn't appear. The special effects are bad and Nemesis is just a mass of makeup, not to mention the music. The only good thing in the movie is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory, which perfomance as a sexy policewoman reults unbelieveable.",1133827200,2,685,4.669421487603306

FANS OF THE GAME WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE-Shawn Edwards,FOX TV

This movie is pretty good. I thought it was better than part1,because is has more action. I recomend this movie if you liked the first movie or if you like the game. I am gonna talk about the dvd aspects of this 2 disc special edition dvd.

  IMAGE:

The biggest problem is black level,as darker scenes often look muddy and a bit grainy. Putting both widescreen and fullscreen transfers on the same side of the disc has also resulted in higher instances of digital artifacting than normal.

  SOUND:

If there is a reason to watch this movie,its the sound design,which really shines in DD 5.1 mix included here. I don't know if its because its only audio track and has thus been given more room to breathe or what,but this is one of the liveliest mixes I've head in quite some time. The front soundstage is very wide,with dialogue always coming in clearly from the center and excellent panning and directionality across the mains. The surrounds are active throughout,whether they're carrying echoes of gunfire,the moans and shuffles of zombies,or the annoying numetal soundtrack. Check out the showdown with the lickers in the church early on for a good example of what I'm talking about: As the creatures crawl around on the ceiling,stalking their pray,the mix track their progresses from left surround to right surround and into the front channels. Very Impressive.

  IMAGE:

The 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen image looks brillantly,hi-tech,smooth,sharp, and clear. The picture quality is not as good as the SuperBit DVD's video only when it comes to shadow-rendering. Had the SuperBit disc not existed, then this one would be great for showing off your expensive new TV.

  SOUND:

The state-of-the-art Dolby Digital 5.1 sound design is tremendous. Sound effects ricochet around the room courtesy of five very active channels and an overactive mix. In fact,the subwoofer isn't made just to thump,rather,the sound designers created a low bass feed that thumps creatively,pulsingly,so you won't hear/feel a continous boom but a mix of booms that will rock you to your bones. However,since everything is so damn loud, you might have to constantly adjust your volume settings in order to hear the actor's dialogue and to avoid blowing out your speakers. There's also a DD 2.0 surround Spanish track, Optional English,French,Portuguese,and Spanish subtitles as well as optional English closed captions support the audio.

  SPECIAL FEATURES:

The original Special Edition had a decent collection of extras. The Deluxe Edition is a simple expansion of the Special Edition, so it's up to you if you want to buy it.

The first extras are two audio commentaries. From the first Special Edition we get and audio commentary bu Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla Jovovich,Michelle Rodriquez and producer Jeremy Bolt. They share a lot of laughs about the movie while they discuss what was done to create each scene that flickers across the screen. This is actually fun,enjoyable commentary even though the commentators are talking about a dreary,dreadful enterprise. The other audio commentary features members of the visual effects team, and as expected, this is a technicalminded and occasionaly boring track if you're not a total tech wonk.

2448731,2,B000BYRCR4,"Is it even possible to make a decent movie out of a video game? As we continue our tour of movies pre-made from video games, we're starting to doubt that. Video games have already revealed everything. Where can the movie go and stay true to the video game (assuming ""staying true"" has any meaning in such circumstances). In RS2 we're given every genre gimmick and stereo-type in the book trying to flesh out a story that is already very well-known. Nothing can ever succeed on that basis. Good movies--great movies--are new, strange, and exciting. The writing needs to go in utterly new directions to be meaningful. It's a tremendous risk... and probably one the studios are unwilling to take. But there is a precedent. Shakespeare himself took stories--well-known stories--and wove them in new ways to create the greatest stage-plays ever written. Is this so entirely different from taking concepts from video games and putting them on the screen? Video games provide a shorthand and background that screenwriters could exploit if they chose. Instead, the choose to exploit a too-willing audience.

WHO SHOULD SEE THIS

As we've often stated here at Inchoatus, there is a certain charm in going to see some kind of mindless film. Well, this film is utterly mindless. And it has swearing, nudity, blood, and fighting to go with it. If you want to get seriously drunk and go see some women kick ass, then you've probably found a movie. Go rent it and just make sure you're pretty damned drunk when you go see it. There is no reason--none at all--to see it sober. The film is void of any artistic merit whatsoever.

WHO SHOULD AVOID

The goal of Inchoatus is to elevate the genre. We're founded precisely to encourage people to avoid films precisely like this. There are actually some decent films out there that feature blood, nudity, and fighting. Conan the Barbarian is an excellent example. The Event Horizon is another. Even Underworld had some merit to it. The anim film Ghost in a Shell is a tremendous film. As the core audience for all things speculative fiction, we don't have to automatically succumb to this kind of stuff just because they market it. If we can just muster the strength to show a little resistance to this kind of schlock, producers will be forced to provide something better. Is there a better reason to avoid seeing this film? We think not.

Obviously, anyone who isn't well and truly immersed in zombie movies or horror flicks--or has a very serious thing for Milla Jovavich--should avoid this film.

any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this case

however the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we the

viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.

Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)",1131840000,2,863,4.695364238410596

2448734,4,B000BYRCR4,"well i have to admit they did a great job for a sequel to resident evil.

if your into resident evil or if you like action/horror flicks then this is a must see.

i enjoyed this movie they had more money to spend in making it compared to the first one.

in short this movie takes off where resident evil left off and shows a virus breakout onto the city of raccoon.

now i don't want to reveal to much ill try to keep it short so as i said above the virus was released due to the fact that umbrella scientist wanted to go back and reopen the hive to see what happen to the hive.

they underestimated the outbreak of the virus with in the hive which in turn they couldn't contain it and was released onto the city.

alice was awaken as well as nemisis an alternate plan of umbrella to see which is stronger and be more viable as a bio weapon.

that is about all i will say if i told the whole story you wouldnt want to see the movie.

the actors did a great job once again bringing it to life as well as some comedy in the movie as well.

i enjoyed this but i liked the original better anyway if you collect resident evil items then this is a must have as well as a must see.

i rated it a four star due to the fact that some of the special effects just didn't fit in place with the movie as well as they did what they could on making nemisis real but with todays technology i feel they couldve done better.

the pace of the movie is nonstop and the feel of the movie was great as well as the sounds effects were great also.

the other con to the movie was the film angle of the zombies or how should i put it they zipped them in and out persay its hard to describe once you see the movie youll know what i mean.

now the other con is the zombies themselves before i saw land of the dead i thought resident evil zombies were great and made perfect but when i saw land of the dead and george romero zombies well im sorry romero wins hands down.

i feel that they couldve done a better job with makeup and effects on the zombies but it looked like they spent alot on the lickers in the movie so that mightve put a crimp in there budget and they had to let some things go as far as in detail.

overall its a great movie and a must see and turn out the lights grab some popcorn get ready for some good fun.",1130630400,,2301,3.9288793103448274

great flick with a great story line from beginning to end and it doesnt leave anything out.

the story is about a corporation named umbrella doing bio weapons research without the public knowing about it.

the lab was under the city called raccoon city and the workers for umbrella live and work there.

then all of a sudden all the people that worked and live in the underground lab died due to the computer than supervised the lab went homicidal then umbrella sent in a special team to shut it down and force it to reboot and find out what happen.

thats all i will tell ya but that is the gist of the movie and i do want to mention a interesting fact that they made this movie on a seriously limited budget.

the special effects are great for what money they were allowed to spend as well as the actors did a heck of a job bringing it to life.

even if you never played the video game it is a must see movie and a must have.

if your a gamer like me the movie brings it home and does not disappoint in any fashion.

so in short great all around flick to own or rent and since it is halloween season great flick to spook ya so go out there rent and or buy it.",1130630400,,1318,3.9809885931558937
2448736,5,B000BYRCR4,"Contrary to belief and contrary what every hardcore-gamers and ""gore fest obsessed"" moviegoers like to say, ""Resident Evil"" is an excellent ""prelude"" to the very source martial it is playing off of. (What many people do not realize, is that the decision to make Resident Evil different from the games was made by Constantin Film and Capcom and not by Paul W.S. Anderson).

I found Resident Evil incredibly hard four years ago to watch. Horror movies aren't my forte, therefore I never bothered to watch this. But to my great surprise - the movie wasn't that bad. And while it still holds the fear-factor for me, I can watch the movie now without worrying about frayed nerves afterward.

The movie starts out slow placed with a disembodied narrator before switching to the main event in which the storyline will be taking place. From there the movie introduces the female protagonist, Alice Parks who awakens with no memory whatsoever. She wanders around the elaborate mansion with no clue about the surrounding things within the environment around her. And before she is able to get her head straight she is jumped by a ""Cop"" by the name of Matt Addison (""The Crow: Salvation""'s Eric Mabius), who is apprehended by several Commandos who swiftly invade the mansion demanding a report from the amnesiac Alice.

From there the Umbrella Commandos head down into a secret facility, ""The Hive,"" dragging along with them Alice and a handcuffed Matt. They also meet yet another amnesiac, Spencer Parks, whom they found upon making their way to the hive. As the movie progresses things start to go wrong when they shut down the RED QUEEN super computer.

The movie shows off what it does best, and that is the walking dead. And the utterly creepy thing about the undead in this movie, is that they're not creatures from another dimension, but former humans all killed for a senseless purpose, their bodies reanimated for one purpose: Feeding on the living inhabitants (however, how they tell living from dead apart continues to be a mystery to me). This increases the creepy factor just a little bit more than usual. The acting (Spanning from minor to major, and undead) is amazing, never wooden or unrealistic for a moment.

This move had major talent for a cast of characters. Milla Jovovich's character Alice before ""Apocalypse"" is more relatable and much more likable, in the first movie than she was in the sequel which helped me understand her rigid and less feminine personality in the second movie. Broadway talens Martin Crewes, and James Purefoy (Spencer Parks) play out their small roles to the extent of their obvious screen talent, but Crewes' character (Chad Kaplan) turns out to be the more likable out of the two through out the movie. Colin Salmon (famous for his role in the 3 of the 1997-1999-2002 Jame Bond movies) plays the leading commando 'One' with his usual leader demeanor and atmopshere used in the James Bond films but with an American accent and more lines. Eric Mabius, famous for playing in 'odd-ball roles' in the usual ""R"" rated movies, turns out to be more believable as an actor in this movie than he has in previous roles. He plays out his character the cop with charm and actual humanity.

Michelle Rodriguez plays her usual ""tough-gal"" character (via ""SWAT"" and ""GIRL FIGHT"" among others) by the name of Rain Ocampo in this movie. Her equal balance of actual personality and granite type character plays off nicely with the character J.D (Pasquale Aleardi). The movie manages to be gruesome and bloody without crossing the ""overkill"" line (via all the other horror movies afterward, including the George A. Ramano movie remakes), it maintains the usual ""jumpy scenes"" common in a horror/action movie. And oddly enough, the music (done by the highly disagreed upon Marilyn Manson) suits this movie well, although there is a particular scene in which it begins to sound like a thousand bees buzzing in your ears. It plays off electronic/techo/rock tempo quite nicely for the movie without crossing the line also.

Now as for the CGI animation for the Lickers and the schematic of the Hive: Its the best done for this kind of movie. Though at times the Licker does seem out of place in some scenes(he appears to come off the background instead of blending in with it), it otherwise flawlessly blends within the film. The Hive Schematic was usual 3D animation, its never painful to the eyes and it works well with what its got.

The Special features for the ""DELUXE EDITION"" reaches beyond the ""SPECIAL EDITION"" DVD, while still maintaining its Windscreen, subtitle, and language selection. The following which are:

1): Alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction
2): Clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse
3): Commentary by cast & filmmakers
4): Visual effects commentary
5): Costumes featurette
6): Featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen. The list goes on.

All in all, this movie still scares me (slightly) still. However, I cannot deny its a cool movie I'd be willing to watch just for the scare. Paul W.S. Anderson did a good job directing and writing this movie. The acting is great from all the actors. The storyline is not hard to figure out but its great for this kind of movie and an absolute plus is that its not a complete carbon-copy/import/retelling of the game. It does a good job using references, atmosphere and locals of the game. Lastly, this movie is much longer and better than its sequel.----- [a 5 out of 5]",1130457600,,5504,4.883297644539614
2448737,3,B000BYRCR4,"I don't usually go in for zombie movies, but I did see the first one and didn't hate it.  I liked this one much better than the first one mostly because of the action and the interaction between the characters.  I liked the fact that the women kick ass and I'm a sucker for Oded Fehr ever since The Mummy movies.  And, well, Mila may be a skinny-ass model, but she's highly likeable just as in The Fifth Element.

2448738,1,B000BYRCR4,"How this has a 3.5 star average is beyond me. My room mate told me this was the ""best film he had ever seen."" Mind you, he is also a fan of Lizzy McGuire, so I took this recommendation with weary cynicism. Nonetheless, after a family party and a few too many Corona's, my brother and I reluctantly rented this glutton of a film.

Now, I do believe in the ""so bad its good"" aesthetic. Some movies like ""XXX"" are so bad they are good. This however, is so bad its painful. When the dumbest looking monster I have ever seen shows up on screen bound to a rocket launcher I was embarassed to be watching this movie. The acting is so poor it makes Paul Walker's thespian skills comprable to Sir Ben Kingsley's. There are so many explosions the action scenes lose meanings. All of the actors should be banned from the screen actors guild. The studio responsible should be shut down. This movie not only reflects pooly on cinema, but on the movie going audience as a whole.

His second try at the Resident Evil series, while better then the first, is still crap compared to REAL horror movies. It's kinda like asking to be kicked in the nuts once instead of twice...ones better but who really wants either option?

I guess this is fine though for people who can't handle the real horror movies, like 15 year old girls and horny guys who only want to stare at the hot main star. It's generic and cheap looking at times, much more so then the budget would suggest.

I would only recommend this if you can't handle real horror, or if you've already seen all there is to see in the form of horror movies.",1128902400,2,737,4.404411764705882
2448743,4,B000BYRCR4,"I remember going to watch the first installment of this series with my old friend in the cinema. And I have to say it was really great and alot of fun, even if some things were a little questionable. A little while ago I watched ""Resident Evil - Apocalypse"" on DVD. And I found it to be very good, but it just wasn't as good as the original. Allow me to elaborate a little...

""R.E - Apocalypse"" picks up from the ending of ""R.E."" Basically, we find that Raccoon City is under siege by a terrible plague that brings the dead to life (surprise!). We are soon introduced to some new characters, one being Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory). Now when I saw Jill for the first time she looked exactly like the Jill from the games - except here she has black rather than brown hair! It's a minor thing of course, but obviously sufficient attention wasn't given to the appearance of characters. Anyway, Jill's ruthless and good with a gun, and that's all that matters. Later on we also meet Carlos Olivera (played by Oded Fehr. Carlos was from the third Resident Evil Game). He's a leader and a great fighter, but this Carlos is much older than the Carlos from the game. Nemesis is pretty well done but his face just looks slightly different from what I remember. And the Nemesis in the movie has some pretty massive guns, which is true to the games as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, all the human characters trapped in the city must escape Raccoon City before dawn or they'll all be turned into Nuclear Pulp. The storyline is similar to the games but it's not particularly original. Overall characters get 7/10 and the storyline gets 6/10.

The monsters in ""R.E - Apocalypse"" are well done, but the zombies are not as gruesome as they were in the previous movie. Those creatures with the massive tongues are pretty well done and the mutant Dobermans are great. I've already talked about Nemesis, so I'll continue...all creatures and monsters have unique characteristics and are pretty ugly for the most part, so I'll give monsters and creatures 8/10. The zombies are not always completely convincing, but the zombie kids were awesome! No doubt about that...

The structure of the film is a little disjointed at times and not really condusive to an action film, but it's forgivable as the action scenes more than compensate for this. The explosions are big, the conflict violent and complex, and the drama convincing.  In this respect I'll give ""R.E - Apocalypse"" 8/10 for action and drama, but 6/10 for the structure. It's just what I felt, so don't take it as an attack on you if you enjoyed the stucture. Conversely one could say that the disjointed structure merely heightens the drama, so perhaps structure deserves 7/10. But it's your choice and opinion that inevitably matters.

I think the setting of a chaotic city is fascinating and the environments are nicely done. Well, perhaps I should say the environments look like they've been ravaged and destroyed. There were plenty of zombies, lots of broken glass and abandoned vehicles, blood spatters and finally empty streets. The environments are very convincing and deserve 9/10. Perhaps the directors could've used filters in some places to enhance the film and its tension, but perhaps it would've made it more of an Art Movie, which it definitely is not! So that comment is just an aside from me...

One thing I found to be funny was Stefan Hayes' (or Yuri Loginova's) extremely dodgy Russian accent! At times he got the accent nailed, but there were instances where he sounded like an American or an angry European! Look, it didn't bother me much and he doesn't speak that much in the movie. All I can say is that I've met Russian people, and if you think THAT's Russian, well...it's not I'm afraid. It's not hard to miss his poor accent, it's extremely noticeable.

Overall ""Resident Evil - Apocalypse"" gets 75% according to my percentage system. It's fun and entertaining but is extremely far fetched in some cases (an example of this is when Alice arrives in the nick of time to save Valentine (et al) by smashing through a stained-glass window on a motorcycle, then landing and back-flipping off. The bike then ramps and she fires to shots that hit the gas tank, causing the bike to combust and killing some of the long tongued creatures. I'm sorry, she may be super, but that's a steaming pile of goat s***) and is flawed in many places. Don't get me wrong, I'll watch it again, but it's no classic and certainly not totally well done. And if you think that's wrong, ask a stuntman to backflip off a bike, ramp it and blow it up without killing himself. I rest my case. So it's a cool film, but nothing I would call special. Buy if you like, it's a 50-50 for me...",1128902400,,4733,4.634088200238379

Sure the lead character is hot, sure there are some nice looking zombies in the movie...but thats where all the good stuff ends.

The video game for the PS1 (and it's gamecube remake) are amazing, both in atmosphere and story telling, why the movie didn't follow them more closely is beyond me. Instead you get some horrible story about a computer and the t-virus (which is the only thing in the entire movie from the games, that and the spider-man creature).

It is a really good movie but it does not have alot of character development as the first one really did have. But it is still a really good movie. The action scenes are alot more artistic than in the original and the zombies and creatures (NEMESIS!) look awesome. My favorite character is L.J. played hilariously by Mike Epps.

2448751,2,B000BYRCR4,"To say this movie was a good, successful one would in fact be a lie. In my opinion this was a terrible sequel to a movie that I adore. For starters, it is unrealistic in its approach to situations presented in the Resident Evil world, and by taking away Alice's feminine vulnerability it detracts from her character a heck of a lot.

The staged characters that are in the games are nothing like their counterparts. Jill, for one, does not do the character justice at all, nor does Carlos. And can I say that the other characters while at first seemed interesting, were killed off far too quickly to develop any emotional attachment to them.

The pace of the movie was too fast and it was not easy to catch on to what we are supposed to be seeing. Not only that, but every five seconds it seemd like there is a fight scene that has no purpose what-so-ever as opposed to the balanced feel of it's predecessor.

2448753,1,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is an onion of stupidity. It's just layer after layer after layer of the most retarded plot points, character dialogue and CG that I have ever been forced to sit through.

The story goes that under the streets of Racoon City there is a secret facility (The Hive) controlled by Umbrella (a massive pharmacutical company) which is designed for creating vast viral weaponry.
An outbreak occurs turing all the staff into flesh hungry zombies.

Now to get to the aspects of the film that made it so god-awful.
I'm pretty much going to ruin the ending for anyone reading further than here so if you haven't seen the film and actually care about the end don't read any further. Repeat MAJOR SPOILERS!

The outbreak occurs when Spencer shatters a vial of T-virus against a lab table on his way out of the Hive. The icicle virus melts, the water evaporates and carries viral particles through the air vents, infecting the entire staff.

Do you have any idea how unrealistic and stupid it is to have a facility where it's cubicles share the same air as laboratories working with Level 4 biohazards?!?

Next, the security team successfully infiltrates the Hive in order to stop Red Queen (the main computer) who has killed all the inhabitants in order to contain the outbreak.
Does Red Queen greet the Umbrella personnel and explain her actions to them? Does she reveal ANY helpful information to these people who in all respects she should view as her masters?? NO!
First she slaughters half the team in a laser grid based trap, and says ""You're all going to die down here."" The laser trap was stupid because there is an area of about 3 feet by the entrance to Red Queen's chamber where the laser grids can't reach. The leader of the security group is safe for a bit and actually backs up so he can get cut to pieces like the rest of his team.

Then after all the zombies have been released, you see these shambling corpses with bite marks, and half eaten faces. This makes no sense as everyone was killed by Red Queen at the same time. So they all should have become zombies at the same time, which would give them no reason to feed on one another.

The whole Alice in Wonderland fixation is a waste as well.
Elevator behind the mirror (looking glass), main character's name (Alice), going underground/down the rabbit hole), Red Queen. This doesn't help to forward or support the storyline in any way. It was all fun and cryptic in The Matrix, but it's pretty obvious the story writers just ripped it off.

This movie was the worst zombie film I have seen next to RE Apocalypse. This movie isn't worth buying, it isn't worth renting, it isn't worth the DVD is was burned to. Save you cash and your time.",1123804800,7,2708,4.55761316872428
2448754,4,B000BYRCR4,"From all the reviews I've read for this movie, they're pretty mixed in opinion. Some people Have been ranging on about how the movie sucked and how ""scantly dressed"" the female characters (I.E., Jill Valentine and Alice) are and ect. But really, the reviews --- for the most part--- could not be more far from the truth than the Miami Dolphins lost in Baltimore. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is the coolest movie of late summer 2004, only second to ""Spider-Man II."" It's that great of a movie. Contrary to belief, ""Resident Evil"" had a major scare factor for me, I still cannot will myself to watch the Claustrophobic-filmed movie that left me with a sense of hopelessness for the characters as they were attacked by the former ""Hive"" employees of the Umbrella Corporation. So you can believe that when I heard ""RE:A"" was on Television (7-2-05) I had a pretty hard time willing myself to watch it. I was that scared of it. I had watched enough for the first movie to understand the sequel:

- [The Umbrella CORP. has reopened the hive after capturing Matt (Eric Malbus) and Alice from their narrow escape from the hive upon sealing it to prevent further contamination. Both have been subjected to laboratory experiments with the T-Virus under the orders of men named Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen - Tomb Raider), but only Alice is left partially unscathed through the entire incident. However, Alice's attempts to keep the T-virus from escaping the underground facility were foiled by the Umbrella CORP when they reopen the HIVE and released the T-Virus and the lickers along with it. Thus creating mass hysteria within the walls of Raccoon City whose citizens have fallen prey to the deadly virus and are locked inside the city when it reaches the city limits.

Jill Valentine (from CAPCOM's Resident Evil game series, played by Sienna Guillory) a S.T.A.R.S. operative who was suspended for her accusations against the Umbrella CORP., her partner Pyeton Wells (Razaaq Adoti), along with whether reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt), take refuge in a church after Pyeton is bitten by one of the recently undead at the city gate and are met with more trouble. Their saving grace happens to be ""PROGRAM"" Alice (Milla Jovovich!!) who has been genetically enhanced by the T-virus and Anti-virus, armed to the teeth with guns of every kind and superhuman strength to boot.

The newfound group of survivors make their way through the city toward a hopeful exit before Raccoon City is sanitized by a Nuclear Missile strong enough to reradiate the virus and everything else. They're then contacted by Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), the creator of the T-virus, who wants them to head to the school where his daughter Angela ""Angie"" Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur; ""Evelyn - 2001"") --- whom he designed the ""RED QUEEN"" after ---- is hiding out after the van she was in was hit with a Semi truck. Right behind them S.T.A.R.S. elite Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and Nicholai Sokolov (whom was a villain in the game. ---- played by Zack Ward) and the wandering Raccoon City resident pimp L.J. (Mike Epps) who also get a call from the so-called ""Dr. Doom. Unbeknownst to the group as they approach the school, the Umbrella CORP. has unleashed their ultimate Bio-weapon ""PROGRAM"" Nemesis (from Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Played by Matthew G. Taylor and not Eric Malbus) monitored by Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann), whose primary objective is to kill all the S.T.A.R.S. members that were still alive and battle Alice for superiority of sorts.]""

---------- Apocalypse deals heavily with Alice regaining her forgotten memory after she is captured and subjected to tests and the secondary star of the movie ""Nemesis"" who was her friend, Matt Addison. While the movie deals with the subject of the undead, the plot is strictly character driven in the every way possible; You actual care about what will happen to all the people who survived the outbreak in Raccoon City. The scare factor in the movie for me has diminished somewhat after I conquered my fear of watching it but it still holds some kind of fear over me when it comes to all the Undead scenes which are truly something to be scared about for the ""most"" part. Milla Jovovich's character Alice kicks Jill Valentine (who really isn't given much to do in the movie) to the passengers seat and really kicks major ass in this movie, the action scenes in this movie are a sight to behold, its practically nonstop through out the entire movie but does nothing to dissipate the movie's twisting plot.

Alice's stunts are the coolest ever--- from the graveyard battle, the 100-Foot dash down City Hall (which Milla did the last of the stunt herself) to her battle with Nemesis, the action for this character is undeniably the best ever and better than her exploits in the first movie. Jill Valentine, however, manages to hold a special place in my heart and basically gets to do some pretty awesome things herself (Fighting the undead to some wicked handgun fights) but her range is basically limited since the movie is focused on Alice. The comic Relief provided by Mike Epps' character ""L.J. ,"" is actually pretty funny and does not kill the atmosphere of horror/action in the movie.

Oded Fehr does pretty a pretty good job with the limited character Carlos Olivera, he's never too macho and his character is quite likable (much like Nicholai was). Most of all the music is well fitted and plays best on the most important parts of movie overall. Best of all, Resident Evil: Apocalypse deals heavily with the video games in only a way the fanboys of the games would recognize. All in all this movie was up-to-specs and majorly different from the horde of Horror movies concerning the Undead that came out in 2004. There are indeed, plot holes big enough to stick your finger through but this does nothing to diminish the movie's high-rate enjoyment. Purchase this movie if your a fan of Milla Jovovich or the Resident Evil series, but consider this movie with an open mind. This movie contains brief scenes of nudity, mild-swearing, gory scenes, frightening images, and nonstop action violence (Written by Paul Anderson, Directed by Alexander Witt). FYI: The female protagonists, Jill and Alice are not ""scantly dressed"" they're quite covered with clothing for combat and easy mobility -----[a 5 out of 5]",1123372800,8,6334,4.881970260223048

He even goes as far as stealing the ""We are assets, expendable assets"" line from Predator and ""Newt, I like that"" line from Aliens (although it's ""Angie, I like that"").  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the characters as there is only one returning from the original movie and the rest are just thrown in for thrills.  Jill Valentine's inclusion is absurd and pointless as the first movie had nothing to do with the characters from the games, so why include them in the sequel?  Alice from the first movie is equally two-dimensional as she has suffered a complete pointless personality change.  She protested killing people after they were bitten in the first movie, but the first thing she does when that happens to someone in this is point a gun at them and prepare to fire.  Yeah, I know it's terrible.  This is the most illogical movie of all time.  Why would Alice drive her motorcycle through the stain-glass window of a church instead of walking through the door, and how did she even know how to get in there?  Why didn't Alice simply kick the villain's butt when he said ""Fight him"" and she said ""no"".  Moments earlier she had killed several guards with relative ease, but now she couldn't do it?  I don't think so.  I cannot believe that this story was bought and actually green-lit to be made into a feature film.  That's the most ridiculous thing of all time and after Ghosts of Mars and this movie Screen Gems' credibility has just fallen to rock bottom.

Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games.

Were any of you aware that George Romero (like I have to say it...but the creator of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead) wrote a screen play for the first Resident Evil.

It's pretty good of its kind. You know, the UnDead walk the earth (stumble, mostly), driven only by the urge to chomp on anyone not yet of their kind. Genus: scary monster movie, Species: undead zombie, Distinguishing features: Milla Jovovich.

'Resident Evil' does a pretty fair job. This time, the cause is is a virus cooked up in secret labs by The Evil Corporation, tapping into more modern kinds of fears and kinds of bad guys. (Give the movie a little time, and your idea of who's bad might change.) The action is strong, continuous, and well paced, with one more surprise in every scene, right up to the end. That ending, of course, sets up the inevitable sequel.

Since they followed the recipe for a good monster/action flick, not a lot could go wrong. Milla's babe appeal spiced up the mix in a few places, especially near the end, but could have been used more. The movie dishes out big servings of action, served with a side of gore. In the end, though, the result lacks flavor. I enjoyed watching it, but it never really rises above its genre.

2448765,3,B000BYRCR4,"I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil games. In fact, I denied that any other games existed for a long time. After seeing and, consequently, being disappointed in the first Resident Evil, I debated about seeing ""Apocalypse"" up until today. Having finally watched it, I am now qualified to write a review.

Firstly, the lack of Claire and Leon is moderately distressing. I watched the entire first movie wondering if Milla Jovavich was supposed to be Claire or Jill. Seeing as her name is Alice, the mystery deepens.

The action was decent, though highly unrealistic when correlated with game play. I know, I know, I'm being a nerdy purist, but the fact is, Alice kicks much ass with her hands and legs....have you ever tried killing one of those damn zombies with your handy dandy Bowie knife when you blew all your magnum bullets on the dogs? I think the game ends right there. Too much kung foo, and out of focus too.

I understand a man's need to see girls in skimpy clothing and even blow some heads off and do a somersault over a motorcycle, but this is ridiculous. Jill's top would TOTALLY have buckled like a belt about 80 times during the film. She even had a bit more on in the game!!

But I digress. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, I'm just saying more people would find it more irritating if they had heard Milla Jovavich sing. Not quite the badass now, eh? I guess all we can do now is wait for Resident Evil 3....",1121904000,,1434,4.4

Now.. this movie IS based on a video game.. so if realistic plots and the norm is what you expect, you won't like this movie.

Resident Evil (# 1) is about a group of soldiers that must destroy a virus before it has a deadly effect on the world.

2448769,4,B000BYRCR4,"At the end of the first movie we were left with a bit of a cliff hanger.  In this one we see just how the cliff hanger came about and how it is resolved.  Racoon City has been ravaged by the T-Virus and its ability to animate dead tissue.  The city has been walled off from the rest of the world by the Umbrella Corporation.

Umbrella's interest in the city is varied.  Can the city be reclaimed?  Can the virus be contained?  But it also provides a chance for proper field testing of other projects, particularly Project Nemesis.  Through all of this we follow a handful of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to find a way out of the city.  In the background a third party is pulling stings for his own benefit to locate his daughter who was left behind in the city.

The film is full of action and fighting.  There is less suspense than in the first and most of the monsters and hazards are straight from the first movie.  But it is the characters and what has been done to them, and how they handle it, that provides the real story in this film.  Needless to say there is another cliffhanger/opening at the end to pave the way for a third movie.  Most of the action happens at night so the sets are dark.  The action is fast and between the lighting and the speed, the fight scenes are often uncomprehendable.

If you liked the first movie or the games, you will probably like this one as it is not just a rehashing of previous stories.",1119398400,5,1452,4.244525547445256

2448771,2,B000BYRCR4,"The first Resident Evil movie was a homage to zombie movies that have gone before.  And Aliens.  And a few other movies thrown in for good measure.  It had a creepy girl, zombies, long-tongued monsters, carnivorous dogs, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) with lots of firepower.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse has all of those things, but none of the spunk.  Where the first movie had a relentless ambiance of terror, Apocalypse is a juiced up action horror without much horror.

PLEASE NOTE: This review contains spoilers, but that's sort of like saying ""water might be wet""--everything I explain here is painfully obvious from the start of the film.  So read at your own risk, but you're not risking much...

Where we last left Alice, she and the other survivor of the movie, Matt Addison (Eric Mabius), were captured by the evil Umbrella Corporation for experimentation.  When she awoke, nobody was left alive in the hospital (shades of 28 Days Later).  So Alice does what she always does in an uncertain situation...she grabs a shotgun.

Meanwhile, the entire city has been infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon that 1) mutates Alice into a superhuman killing machine, 2) turns poor Matt into Nemesis, a muscle-bound gun-toting juggernaut, 3) turns people into zombies, 4) turns dogs into zombies, 5) allows a little girl (Angie Ashford, played by Sophie Vavasseur) to walk, 6) did I mention it turns people into zombies?

So what does Umbrella do?  What all authorities do in a zombie movie: they seal off Raccoon City and call in the nukes (shades of Return of the Living Dead).

Also running about trapped in the city is a cast of stereotypes: the hot police chick (Jill Valentine, played by Sienna Guillory who fails miserably at disguising her British accent), the hot military dude (Carlos Olivera, played by Oded Fehr), and the funny black guy who swears a lot (L.J., played by Mike Epps).  After lots of grandstanding, swearing, amazingly accurate zombie head shots, and a lot of confusion, the plot finally gets going when Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) gives them a mission.

Using his amazing ""personnel locator"" that only seems to work for Dr. Ashford, he discovers that Angie is holed up in her school, all by herself.  We're not sure exactly how this is possible, but never you mind...what matters is Ashford hacks into the entire Raccoon City network and is able to view what's going on from every video camera and microphone.  He then calls our heroes with a deal: if they agree to get his little girl out of the city, he will tell them how to escape.

The means of escape is through a helicopter.  That's it.  That's the big plan.  Hijack a helicopter.  But of course, it's all a trap, and ultimately Alice and Nemesis must duke it out...for some reason.  Something about the perfect weapon, yadda yadda.

There are a lot of neat graphical touches throughout the film.  Alice's bullets have little Umbrella Corp. icons on them.  The helicopters are painted with the Umbrella Corp. logo.  And the end of the film (and subsequent cover-up of the nuclear blast) is entertaining in the same way that the rise of a zombie outbreak was entertaining in Shaun of the Dead.  Which is to say it's awful, but you enjoy it anyway.

But that's it.  Alice is far too much of a superhero to make us feel concerned about her survival.  There are too many characters to keep track of without enough plot development to care about them (Carlos seems to have no actual value at all, less so than even L.J.'s offensive portrayal as a black gangsta). And for some reason, Alice's every move is punctuated by a whiplash sound that quickly gets tiresome.

There's a lot of slow motion action sequences, a lot of blue lensing, and a lot of freeze-frame shots of weapons dropping to the ground. The director (Alexander Witt) is new to directing a film on his own.  He doesn't seem to know what to do with Paul W.S. Anderson's script, and it shows.

The movie drags on and on and on long after it should end, such that it feels a lot like you're watching the third film (an inevitability).  By that time I had lost interest.  When the most interesting part of a film is Jill Valentine's miniskirt, it's hard to care about Alice's fate.",1119139200,,4224,4.713506139154161
2448772,2,B000BYRCR4,"John Huston once said that a good story should have ""excitement,color, spectacle and humor, adventure, high drama, tragedy, good conversation, truth and irony"". Unfortunately the discerning viewer won't find much of any of those qualities in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". What they will find is a mildly entertaining spectacle of excess. There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.

The ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching ""Beauty and the Beast"" over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.

The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.

Finally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads.  Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh every time they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's ""Zoolander"" look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in ""Dummy"" than she does in her ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" outfits.

2448774,2,B000BYRCR4,"The chorus goes ""Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson? He's the biggest hack in the whole wide world, if there ever was a hack, he'd be the biggest hack, he's a big fat big fat stupid hack! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he's a stupid hack!"" Well you get the idea.

 REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie, and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face, and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.

 Jill Valentine, and Nemesis, and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie. That's where the good news ends, however, as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill, Chris, Leon, and Claire. The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis (PS1, GCN, DC, PC). Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive. Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character, and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat. I didn't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along. But its hard to get along with yourself, really... these two were identical in attitude, tone (which was just awful) and even their posture! Not only that, but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game. They may have put her in the same costume, gave her the same name, but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.

 What it boils down to is this, game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form. We never asked for Alice, we don't want Alice, drop kick Alice! Let's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script. PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects. He ruins everything he touches.

2448775,4,B000BYRCR4,"I feel that both of these films are somewhat underrated.  They were hurt by critics who sort of missed the point and by video gamers who expected them to be carbon-copies of the games.  They are, simply, very good zombie movies - lots of campy fun, great action, and even some genuine scares.  They're just fun to watch, and one of the big reasons for that is Milla - who looks great and is just perfect for this role, simultaneously strong and vulnerable.  (An earlier review said these were among her first films - in fact, she has been acting since 1991, when she famously appeared nude at age 14 in ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"".  She is a veteran actress with nearly 20 films to her credit.)

It is true that these films don't do much that's new with the genre - if that's what you're looking for, see ""28 Days Later"" instead.  But the Resident Evil films do the traditional zombie genre as well as any film has recently, with great special effects (these were big-budget films), good acting and a lot of action.",1117929600,44,1015,4.424731182795699
2448776,3,B000BYRCR4,"This 2004 horror/action sequel from Sony is among the first titles to be ported to the PSP UMD video format.  Starring the lovely Milla Jovovich, RE:A is loosely based on the video game series from Capcom.

The Movie <spoiler alert!>

Let's just be honest here: when you're dealing with a movie based on a B-genre video game title you are asking for trouble.  The fact that said movie is a sequel further exacerbates the problem.  Now, the first RE movie was actually a  moderate success.  Beautiful Milla was a likeable heroine and the plot was servicable, if full of blatant rip-offs from a host of better sci-fi/horror flicks.  Still, the movie was well-paced, and had a killer opening sequence.  There was a fair balance of action, horror, and science fiction throughout.

RE:Apocolypse, by contrast, is a more straight forward action film that suffers as a result of it's own failed expectations.  The story basically centers around how the shadowy, uber-corporation, Umbrella, ends up pitting their two greatest genetic warriors, Alice and Nemesis (her now mutated beyond recognition old partner/lover), against each other.  The whole middle of the movie is simply filler to allow a couple of characters from the game series (Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera, played by Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr respectively) to make an appearance and provide a plot device to segue to a possible third sequel.

Granted you can't expect too much from a movie like this, but my biggest gripe by far is the very lame guy-in-a-rubber suit fight at the end.  Director Alexander Witt tries his best to hide this really really really bad attempt at a ""Big Boss Battle"" between Alice and Nemesis with very close-up, choppy camera work, and quick-cut edits, but it's pretty obvious that they needed a budget for digital effects that they did not end up getting.

Overall, this movie is at least half-way entertaining, especially if you're a fan of Milla as she is quite the ass-kicker.  Jovovich is quoted as being a fan of the game, and it's to her credit that she takes this role seriously enough to lend it some credibility despite the tacky premise and uninspired, contrived scripting.

The Video

Pretty close to what you would find on DVD.  There is some bleeding/saturation of dark scenes that you would expect from the LCD screen, but overall it's nothing that only a real videophile would get riled over.

The Sound

Dialog is soft, but the general sound field and effects are well done.  For example, helicopter rotors moving across the screen have the appropriate effect on the headphones.  Nice.

Special Features

There are none.

Summary

Despite it's many flaws, RE:A is really the kind of movie the PSP is going to be concentrating on for now: relatively short, action-oriented films with cheap thrills.  Taken for what it is, it is more of a ""guilty pleasure"" than anything else.

I can't really recommend it, but being a Milla softie I enjoyed it.",1117584000,,2952,4.895161290322581
2448777,3,B000BYRCR4,"With the success of the original movie, Resident Evil.  I find myself seeing the sequel to it, Resident Evil: Apolcalypse.  With low expectations I found that this movie was silly, filled with action, and didn't have much character development nor a very good atmosphere that usually makes up a great film.  With that said, the movie was still good enough to be enjoyed as an entertaining movie.  With another solid acting job as the hero, Milla has convinced me that she belongs as a bad-ass super-hero.",1116460800,,504,4.825581395348837
2448778,3,B000BYRCR4,"I like Milla Jovovich as a superhero.  Her breakout role in ""The Fifth Element"" was all that was needed to sell me on her.  She was fine in the first ""Resident Evil"", which was better than perhaps it was given credit for.  But in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", Jovovich's Alice is given something of a makeover.  When we last saw Alice at the end of the first movie she had been captured by scientists from the evil Umbrella Corporation and was subject to some tests and experiments.  At the end of the movie we saw Alice walking alone on a street that was desolate and ruined, as if there were some sort of war or battle.  It is at this point that ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" begins.

Raccoon City is the victim of the T-Virus from the Umbrella Corporation.  This virus turns ordinary people into flesh eating zombies (is there another kind?), and like any good zombie virus, it is highly contagious.  Umbrella Corporation apparently has the power to lock down the city and prevent anyone from leaving, but there are still some citizens left alive, including ""disgraced"" police officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory).  Jill, and another officer attempt to hide before leaving the city and while being confronted by some nasty zombie creatures they meet Alice.  During that whole period where she was a captive and the victim of experiments, Alice has apparently picked up some sort of upgrade to her natural biology because she kicks serious butt here.  She fights like a super soldier or super hero, more like ""The Fifth Element's"" Leeloo than anyone else.

Besides the hordes of zombies, there is also a new super zombie looking creature called Nemesis which is stalking the city.  Exactly what Nemesis is and where it came from is a little bit of a mystery, though a little thinking about the clues given will solve the riddle fairly quickly.

This is a nothing special action/zombie movie.  Fans of the first ""Resident Evil"" may be disappointed.  I know that despite myself, I did enjoy the first movie.  There was more character interaction and character development, but this movie just had hordes of zombies and a bit too much action.  And while I like Jovivich as a superhero, this didn't seem to be a role that really needed to such an incredibly strong superhero.  I guess I didn't belive it.  The door was left open for a third movie, and perhaps there will be one, but until that point there is no real reason to watch ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"".  There are far better movies out there.

After placing the UMD in the PSP, it's immediately obvious that even at full volume, the built-in audio for the PSP just won't cut it for movies. The dialog is barely audible, while the explosions, gunshots, etc. are blaring. To combat this, try a couple of things:

1. Access the movie menu and increase the volume output

2. Turn off the volume limiter

3. Use some external speakers or headphones

4. Turn off the EQ - EQ should be flat

First, things I liked:

-This one is closer to the games than the first one, there are scenes that are taken straight from the games with some minor modifications.

-The animation blends better with the video here than in the first movie.

-Very decent cutting. After watching the deleted scenes, I noticed they were enjoyable but would have made the movie feel more campy.

-Loved the camera angles.

-The soundtrack's commercial songs seem a bit more polished than the first one's.

-Leads. I don't know who looks better but both Sienna and Milla light up the screen with their beauty. Took some realism away form the movie, but in all honesty I can't complain.

-Deleted scenes. I can understand why they cut them, and thankfully they are on the DVD. Jill's character really becomes my favorite after watching those deleted scenes.

-Outtakes. Not at Jackie Chan level, but amusing still.

Things I didn't like:

-The games' zombie rules seem to have been altered in this movie. It made sense in the first one because the corpses were fresh, here it doesn't make sense in some cases.

-The musical score is not as hauntingly addictive as the first movie's.

-To people who haven't played the games, Jill might seem as a character lacking more background info.

-There are some plot holes, but that happens in the games as well so I am used to it. You might not be.

Recommended if you like the RE games 1-3. Recommended if you need an action fix with bullets, explosions, beautiful women, horror, and an unusual plot.",1114732800,,1545,4.712686567164179
2448782,4,B000BYRCR4,"I have played almost every Resident Evil game that's come out from the first to the latest and greatest Resident Evil 4.  When this movie came out I was pretty hesitant.  Would they do a remake of the first game or would they create an entirely new movie?  And which would I rather they did?  Having seen this movie and the second movie's attempt to incorporate actual video game parts and movie parts, I must say I'm relieved they didn't remake the first Resident Evil movie.

Instead, they created new characters and created a semi-backstory to the events of Resident Evil the video game.  And, also surprisingly, it works pretty well!  What helps is that we have two cool actresses, Michelle Rodriguez and the always enjoyable Milla Jovovich.  But what also worked for this movie is the tension and suspense that built from the very beginning to the exciting climax.

At the beginning of the movie, we have fully clad men and women ready to kick ass but through a series of events, they end up losing lives and most of their ammo.  That is when the true Survival Horror that the video game stands for begins.

Now granted this movie is a rip off of many different and better sci-fi and horror films from Alien to the countless zombie films that have been made.  But what it lacks in originality, it makes up in style.  The action and violence is pretty stylized and it was fun to pick up some RE connections.  You're not looking at an Oscar-winning movie of course, nor is it as good as some of the zombie movies out there (28 Days Later, both versions of Dawn of the Dead, etc) but for what it is, it is very well done.

And, for whatever you can say about the movie in a negative light, Paul Anderson handles the subject matter much more deftly than Uwe Boll could ever do with his own Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead films.  So far, Resident Evil stands tall as the best and, sadly enough, most faithful video game movie yet.  That's not saying too much, given the competition, but it's still a fun, mindless romp through familiar territory.  And it could have been a lot worse.",1114560000,,2092,4.446194225721785
2448783,3,B000BYRCR4,"First of all, I need to get my biases out of the way.  I have followed and played almost every Resident Evil game (both good and bad) from the very first one on the Playstation through the latest and by far the greatest on the Gamecube.  When I heard they were making a Resident Evil movie, I was uncertain of how I felt; were they going to remake a game into a movie or would they create a movie that fit into the Resident Evil mythos?  The first movie did the latter, introducing new characters while fitting pretty nicely into the mythology of the RE videogames.  It wasn't a great movie by far, but it was at least quasi-faithful to the series.

Now we have Resident Evil Apocalypse which falls into the former category as it takes familiar characters and incorporates basically parts of Resident Evil 2 and 3 into movie form.  Unfortunately, it falls flat for me.  On one hand, I was thrilled to finally see the Nemesis on the big screen.  Being the unstoppable killing machine that he is and spouting that famous gravelly line, ""STARS!"" I was immediately excited to see the movie but I was worried how they would incorporate Alice from the movie with Jill from the video game.

To be faithful to the video games, you can't.  It's that simple.  By having this movie, it's as if Resident Evil 3 never took place.  It takes the premise of the movie: people trapped in Raccoon City with zombies and the Nemesis, and completely changes the story.  Every time I started to get pulled into the movie, something would happen that would make me go, ""wait, that didn't happen in the game.""

That said, my friends who haven't played any of the Resident Evil games had a fun time.  I think those who haven't played the video game will have a better chance of enjoying it.  Although, video game aside, I think the action is pretty stale and there's not a build up of tension like in the first movie.  I enjoyed RE 1 much more than this sequel and so did my friends (both RE junkies and not).  However, this movie and this series is much much much better than the majority of video game adaptations.  With movies like House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, even this movie stands as a king above them which is kind of sad.

At any rate, not as good as the first, not very faithful to the video game series and not very thrilling.  But, it can be enjoyable for a rent or to see the Nemesis in a movie.  Hopefully the third movie RE Afterlife will take place before Resident Evil 4 (the game) and won't deal *directly* with any of the games.",1114560000,,2533,4.367521367521367
2448784,2,B000BYRCR4,"Now, the first Resident Evil movie, I didn't see.  But hey, I've got friends who liked it, so I went along to watch Apocalypse with them.  They all liked it, and they can't seem to understand why I didn't like this movie as much as they did.  Yes, surprisingly, the movie is close to the games, but it's cheesy and forgets that while it's a movie, things do need to make sense before you can mess them up.

I was pleasantly surprised at least, that the movie does manage to help me learn the gist of what happened in the first one.  Now I don't have to watch it.

But the first problem with the movie is that it jumps into the plot right away.  No build up (people say this is scary?  all the good horror movies have some sort of build up and suspense, for an example: watch Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining""), which makes the film not scary at all.

The action sequences were tiring at most.  Too flashy and perfect.  It also seems that characters don't have to have knowlegde of where characters are to find them.  For example, Jill and company are fighting off a group of lickers in the church when Alice comes riding through the cathedral on a motorcyle.  She's completely in gear and ready to go, doesn't sustain any wounds from the glass, manages to flip off the bike and kill all the lickers.  But she somehow knew Jill and company were there.  How?  Forget how cool her entrance was!  And then she manages to KNOW them all?

I'll give the movie this though.  Anyone who was a big fan of Resident Evil 3 will appreciate the costume design for Jill and will REALLY enjoy seeing Nemesis on camara.  Even though the plot twist at the end is predictable (OH MY GOD!  Nemesis is Allice's old partner?  you mean we WEREN'T supposed to see that coming?), it was pulled off pretty well.  It was also stupid that Nemesis ends up helping our main protagonists through a disneylike ""Yeah, we used to be buds"" moment.  In the game Nemesis was a relentless bio-weapon that had no feelings or emotions.

Really, I'm not sure why this is such a popular movie among my peers.  It's mindless, and the parts that should be funny aren't.  There was nothing really memorable about the film.  For an action film it's shallow, weak, and the main action heroine is much too perfect.  Was John McClane in Die Hard perfect?  Nope, he still got wounded.

For horror, the movie isn't scary.  Too much of it is ruined by building up too much suspesne.  It comes off as more of a ""OK, let's take bets.  Who is going to die next?""

Really, this isn't a ""horrible"" movie, just a ""bad"" one.  Go on and buy it if you enjoy a lot of mindless action.  But if you're like me, mindless action DOES have to make a little bit of sense, or else it isn't ""mindless"" it's just ""stupid"".",1114300800,,2749,4.351084812623274

The second Resident Evil (apocolypse) is alot different. poor lighting, quick flashy camera work(can you say music video) the movie has no flow, the music sounds like some old nintendo video game music, the cheesy one liner attempts, it just seemed like a bunch of action sequences that had no connection to each other, the flow of the movie was bad. I wish I would have rented this one instead of buying it. This was also the first DVD that the special features are actually better than the Movie itself.",1112918400,6,976,4.427777777777778
2448790,1,B000BYRCR4,"THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!

 I have never seen anything so insultingly lame! How can people actually LIKE this garbage?! If any proof is needed that our education system has went into the toilet, the popularity of this stupid crap is it. This is not a movie, it's a movie trailer with no story to advertise. If I could give it negative stars, I definitely would.

 If you like wrestling and have more than two little Nascar numbers adhered to your car, you'll probably like this inbred junk, otherwise avoid it at all costs. Even that ""Alien vs. Predator"" crap was not this bad, and it reeked as well. The reason they make crappy movies like this is because morons keep paying to see and own them. You people are ruining the world for the rest of us.

 If you want to see an actual HORROR movie, pick up The Exorcist, The Shining, Dawn of the Dead (the original, not that stupid remake piece of filth), or Session 9. Those films had a few advantages over this one. For starters, they had DIRECTORS, not Hollywood, pony-knub sporting cel-phone addicts whose parents bought them a career. Secondly, they had STORIES. Actual CHARACTERS with THOUGHTS, say it with me, THOUGHTS...that's right. Their brains were involved in what was happening in the film, they weren't merely posing with guns and puckering their lips at the camera.

 This movie is for fans. Do you know what a fan is? It's a person who has already decided that they like something before they have even seen it. that is a form of prejudice. Fans are not flattering to a true Artist, because they aren't evaluating the Artists performance objectively, they are merely ""yes-men"". Cheerleaders. The true Artist doesn't want cheers for bad work. And the hack actor secretly laughs at the fans when they accept garbage as quality.

 I'm not trying to be spiteful, but we are being had. There is an elephant in the living room, and someone has to say it.

 If you can't see that ALL movies like this are nothing but commercial garbage to feed the great American cattle drive, then you are either hopelessly ignorant, or borderline retarded. There are lots of great movies to see and own, you are wasting your life watching this crap when you could be seeing movies that keep you thinking about them and their characters for days, weeks, months even. Sometimes YEARS. Life is too short for this level of stupidity.

 If you DO like it and buy it and even (gag) watch it AGAIN, remember that every time some moron is driving like an idiot and holding you up in traffic, it is because the entertainment industry is dumbing down the country, and they get away with it because people like you are helping them. Movies should involve your brain. They should not use flashy camera moves to try and hide the inadequacies of the writer and director. Stop helping Hollywood make people stupid for money, after all, they aren't giving you any of the money they make.

 Or consider this. The people who make movies in hollywood are the same people who nominate and award Oscars. They don't EVER, EVER nominate or award this kind of movie. That is because even THEY DON'T LIKE THEIR OWN FILMS!!! They pretend to in interviews and in commentary tracks, but obviously they aren't going to say ""Well, actually, me and Herbert Bumble-dong only wrote, directed, and produced this film because of all the money we can make off of bovine America"". They won't say that into the camera. They say that to their peers, though. otherwise, their peers would think they were fools. Because only a fool would like a movie this bad.",1112227200,4,3557,4.649122807017544
2448791,5,B000BYRCR4,"I think this is better than the original because it has a lot of action in it but as far as being a zombie movie of sorts it leaves a bit to be desired. For starters, the Resident Evil movies are not very graphically bloody which is what I like with zombie movies. I personally think DAWN OF THE DEAD the original is the best zombie movie ever made because it is realistically gory.

I read the book to Resident Evil Apocalyse and I was sorely disappointed. I thought there really wasn't much about zombies in it but when I saw the movie I changed my mind. Probably because of the action.

I think with this film series they changed genres. The first was really sci fi horror. But the second is really sci fi action.

If you""re looking for a good movie that was made from a video game check out House of the Dead. It has more gore than Resident Evil Apocalypse and is probably a better zombie movie. But I like Resident Evil 2 better.",1112140800,,934,4.235955056179775

(So I guess I should say I hate all video games that are not Resident Evil?)

I was very afraid of watching this second part... afraid of being disappointed, because I loved the first one so much. But rest assure, and what a great relief: this second one is just as awesome!! I love the Resident Evil movies so much that I never grow tired of watching them - and this is a person that doesn't' like one bit watching the same movies more than once.

2448794,4,B000BYRCR4,"Would you like to know why this one wasn't a waste of time like the first movie?  One reason: Paul Anderson didn't direct it.  Mr. WS Anderson seems to have a knack for taking it upon himself to helm larger scale films with infinite potential and make total crap out of them (which he finally managed to steer away from when AVP rolled around), but since he did not direct this installment, it turned out all right.  He did write it, and that I can live with, because his scripts are very visionary and he is a wonderful writer, just not the best filmmaker in the world.

I've rambled on about him long enough, now let's talk about the movie.  Just a day after the events which took place in Resident Evil, one of the two survivors, Alice (Milla Jovivich), has been taken to Raccoon City hospital and quarantined, where she has been experimented on.  Meanwhile, scientists have ventured back into the hive, where they manage to release the hord of zombies still roaming around down there.  Just thirteen hours later, the city is infested with them, and Alice, who has escaped the facility, must escape with another group of survivors, including STARS special againt Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr).  However, this proves to be quite a task for them, as they are not only hindered by mindless, flesh-eating zombies and lightning fast undead canines, but Umbrella Corporation has also unleashed their newest weapon, a 7 foot hulking monstrosity with incredible firepower, code-named Nemesis.

While edgy and seemingly pointless in a few spots, Resident Evil: Apocalypse proves quite an advantage over its predecessor.  The acting is quite well done, the writing seems planned out well and is whitty while sticking to the main points of the movie {kudos to Mr. Anderson), and the zombies are looking pretty juicy!  Not only that, but we are treated to a couple fairly graphic munching scenes.  I was also a little relieved the zombies remained slow, because if they had been very fast (ala Dawn of the Dead '04), there would seem to be no hope, as they've got the humans outnumbered by about a zillion to five.  But, what really stole the show was Nemesis, portrayed by the hulking 6-foot-7 Matthew G. Taylor.  Taylor really lended his performance to Nemesis in this movie, and personally, that is what I felt made this movie worth watching.  Nemesis was just plain cool to watch, and any oversized mutant zombie/human/cyborg decked out in a leather trench-coat-like battle suit with a massive rail gun and an enormous rocket launcher is always fun to watch kick some ass.

All in all, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not fail to deliver the chills, thrills, and cheap laughs that horror/action fans today have come to expect.  It even made by heart race a few times.  Saw it and theaters and bought the DVD, and still enjoy it.",1111708800,2,2819,4.777319587628866

2448796,2,B000BYRCR4,"From my experience, all sci-fi films need one very important ingredient... and this is ATMOSPHERE. Its the foundation block for all great movies in this genre. From classics like Star Wars to new favourites like The Matrix. They tell not just a story, but also of a world different to the one we reside in. That is the heart of a great sci-fi. Without it, characters, plot, nor action can develop. This is where Resident Evil Apocalypse falls apart. From the beginning we are rushed into an established storyline. It begins with a few words from the narrator, explaining the damage already done... and instantly we are expected to follow the paper-thin characters on their journey to righteousness. Its difficult to really care, when we are given little time to absorb the horror of a city under fire. Scenes flip from one character to another, each with a separate agenda. Everything is robotic, human interaction and emotion is minimal and the impact of armageddon is ignored. Its derivative, ironcially much like a computer game, you get bitten... its game over. That is it.

The influences are all there, simplified, squeazed and chopped together.

'Dawn of the Dead' a generic town is ravaged by a zombie outbrake shown in a TV report like fashion

'28 Days later' she wakes in a deserted hospital

'Terminator' dressed in a full leather with a mini gun.

'Robo cop' Remembers friend and defies command to KILL

'Tomb Raider' Girl with two guns wrapped around her thigh

'Aliens' aliens

'Matrix' the action

In the end, it has little originalty, and fails to improve on past formula. Post Viral-Apocalyptic films like Omega Man, Dawn of the dead series and 28 Days Later do a much superior job in creating a world in chaos.. the hysteria, tension, loneliness, despair, humour. That was riveting.

The movie has some breathtaking action and fight sequences that are nearly non-stop (Along with the unnecessary blood and gore, which seriously detracts from the film). The best thing about the film is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory. They can look incredible and kick serious behind at the same time. Their beauty and guts give the film a great boost! Fans of films like ""Aliens"" and the ""Terminator"" trilogy will truly enjoy this one, while others may be turned off by the graphic violence. Whatever your view, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a non-stop action epic that is sure to entertain. Grade: B+",1110844800,,693,4.982758620689655
2448798,5,B000BYRCR4,"I, unlike a lot of people, found this to be a very enjoyable movie. The thing I think few people take into consideration is the fact that Alexander Witt probably didn't set out to break new ground, all this film does is build on what we were left with in Resident Evil. The special effects are tremendous, a lot more detailed than the first one. The acting in a few scenes is a bit shallow but this is an action movie, of course it's not going to have great acting throughout the duration of the film. The exception to that statement is Sienna Guillory who plays the gorgeous Jill Valentine. I can't think of a single person who could play Jill as well as she did. She seems to have settled into the role with ease. And we can't forget the amazingly talented Milla Jovovich reprising her role as Alice. To watch her fight and shoot is pure exhileration. She also has become so much tougher in this one due to the injections of the T Virus she was given.

This movie starts off with a brief recap of what happened in the first film, other than that it picks up right where it left off. The plot is as follows. Racoon City has become a garden of rapidly growing numbers of undead. The Umbrella Corporation has taken it upon itself to quarantine the city, this means building a massive wall that circles the entire city. No one gets in, no one gets out. We are then thrust into heart pounding action sequences and all the things you loved about the first film. The small group we, the viewers, follow consists of Alice, Jill, Carlos, and Dr. Ashford's daughter. They must get to a designated building to then climb effortlessly onto a helicopter and fly off into the sunset. Things don't go as planned, however, and chaos ensues.

The lead characters couldn't have been cast better, Milla and Sienna's chemistry is evident and meshes very well. The addition of Jill Valentine was a good call and I feel that the franchise will be carried out very well with Jill being the main character.

The special features are surprisingly a nice little bonus. We get a ton of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews as well as 20 deleted scenes. Normally I'm not one for special features but the things included in this are done well. We are also treated to a few trailors to other films.

Overall this movie is worthy of the name Resident Evil. It follows the game very well and the characters are represented very well. This is a must for any fan of the genre and also any fans of the game.",1110758400,,2478,4.451541850220265
2448799,1,B000BYRCR4,"This is one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen in my life, and that includes the original Night of the Living Dead.

Apocalypse shows me a crew of people who are supposed to be converting a
video game to a movie, and instead decide to screw logic, reason, and sanity, and just make a movie that will catter to devout, die hard fans of the series. Why does the story have to make sense?? Just slap Resident Evil on the cover and people will pay.

The story begins where the first RE left off. Alice is awakening in an Umbrella hospital and realizes the world is not what she knew. Things are...well they're sh*t Most people are either dead or undead, and the police are trying to create an effective resistance against the zombies. Hotshot, loss cannon S.T.A.R.S cop Jill Valentine takes leave of her suspension and walks into the RPD just in time to cap a few zombies. She then reminds everyone in a tone that is up to par with porn star acting ""They're infected, you have to shoot them  in the head.""

Oh but it get's even better when Jill, her partner, and a reporter are trapped inside a church with two lickers. Alice bursts in on a motorcycle to save the day and the first question I have is, ""How did she know they were there?""

Then they all get to battle hand to hand with a bunch of rotting graveyard zombies which is funny because A. How did the T-virus infect the already-dead-6ft-burried corpses? and B. why did they choose THAT moment to unearth themselves?
The choreagraphy looks good, but then again it's hard to not look like a bad ass when your opponent makes no attempt to defend himself.

Later after making a deal with the lead scientist for a ticket out of this nightmare, they go to a school to retrieve his daughter as their part of the arrangement.
Low on people and ammo in a school full of zombie kids, they do the smart thing and split up which means; yep you guessed it someone is going to die.

I loved the scene where they find out a nuke is coming to destroy the city.
Jill asks, ""What Yield""
Alice, ""50 Megatons""
Jill, ""!@$! me""
Now, how does a police officer know the difference between nuclear yields..and WHY does it matter! It's a nuke! I don't think Umbrella intends on destroying half the city.

Watching Nemesis was just sad. Why is he after S.T.A.R.S members? In the video game it was because they were out to expose Umbrella's dirty secret. In the movie its....""because they're the best."" stupid stupid...

Resident Evil is how a zombie movie should never be done.
Horrible acting, a storyline full of holes and inconsistencies, and the feeling that the creators of this ""movie"" cared more about counting the money it would make rather than making somthing decent give this movie the 1 star is most certainly deserves.

The virus has now spread above ground and the Umbrella cooperation has sealed off the town, which is crawling with zombies.  Civilians and security forces alike are trying to survive and find some way to get out.  In the midst of this pandemonium, Alice has teamed up with an unlikely group in search of the creator's daughter who is none other than the girl whose image had been given to the Red Queen's holograph back in the Hive.

Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!  The only setback is in relation to the part where she, yet again, finds herself trembling/twitching/hurting/screaming etc Have mercy on us please... Can we please have a movie with Milla Jovovich not acting like that (i.e. EXACTLY as she does in the Fifth Element, in Joan of Arc and in the original Resident Evil)?  Is that too much too ask???  It gets tiring after a while!!!

Aside from that, the plot, the setting, the special effects, and the battles are all very good!  The film does a GREAT job of establishing a cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!

The action and suspense is incredible! There were a few times I actually caught myself holding my breath as they made there way through the hive in the first one. The actors all reallly went full throttle with this one. The dialogue, although a little bland at times, feels really genuine coming from the actors. They all seem to believe what they are saying and this pulls you right in with them.

2448803,1,B000BYRCR4,"There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.

The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.

For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.

Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.

The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.",1109980800,7,2489,4.427947598253275

It is an action-packed Nine Monkeys/Tomb Raider type of adventure combining significant elements of horror.

Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, with the exception of the female soldiers who are sooo ""butch"" and ""tough.""  Have mercy on us please... Enough with that!  They are simply not realistic and therefore not convincing in their roles.

The most egregious example of this is the first time Alice and Nemesis fight.  Alice escapes down a garbage chute and Nemesis launches a rocket after her.  It goes off three feet from her butt and her only cover is a wheeled gargage bin.  Alice not only survives, she's unharmed!

Another example:  The deus ex mechanica when they rescue Angela.  Jill's exploding-stove trick doesn't work, but Alice just HAPPENS to have a lit cigarette, she HAPPENS to understand what Jill's plan is, and she HAPPENS to be in just the right place to toss her cig exactly where needed.

The adaptation closest to its source material would be House of the Dead, as much as you hate to see it written it is.  I love House of the Dead by the way.

Now, to the movie.  This movie is excellent.  This movie has more dogs, lickers, zombies, and the inclusion of the Nemesis, considered to be the best Resident Evil monster.  I think those honors go to the lickers, my favorite.  This film doesn't add anything new or innovative to the zombie world, but what film in the past ten years has?  Zombies are flat creatures.  The reason Resident Evil is so cool is that there are more than just zombies included.  Sharks, lickers, hunters, dogs, and tyrants!  This movie is worth the price I payed when it first came out.  I was totally captivated by the action.  The film jumped me at times, and I was totally creeped out in the school scene.  Mike Epps is definitely worth the price of this DVD.  He doesn't try to be a serious character, completely revamping his career, but he sticks to his normal self, LAUGHS, LAUGHS, LAUGHS!  I'll admit that I laughed at EVERY one of his lines.  Just because it isn't the scariet film ever doesn't mean that you shouldn't view it, ignore the bad, horrible reviews and see it.  You owe it to yourself.  Give the filmmakers a chance to make a third.  Other great zombie movies are 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead (2004), Shaun of the Dead, Resident Evil, Romero's holy trilogy, and anything by Lucio Fulci involving zombies.",1109376000,,1619,4.47945205479452

Romero was going to write and direct this movie and was replaced by Paul Anderson(probably becasuse the mainstream movie audiences are flippin' idiots and don't know what a good horror film is). I read Romero's script and it had everything in the Resident Evil game. I hated that the zombies had CG faces. I hated the CG in this movie period. The plot was HORRIBLE. The acting was HORRIBLE. I left the theatre in disgust. Oh yeah, the last thing they had to kill in the movie was a ""Licker"". In Resident Evil 2 game you can kill a ""Licker"" with two shotguns blasts. In the movie they had the hardest time killing the ""Licker"". Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I guess that's what you can expect with Paul Anderson. I refuse to watch Resident Evil 2.

2448813,3,B000BYRCR4,"Hot on the heels of Dawn of the Dead remake and well past our memory retention for it's original, RE: Apocalypse picks up right about where the first one left off.  This time, it's an entire city that's being brought down by a virus invested population instead of a claustrophobic high tech lab.

A recap voice over given by Alice (in Wonderland?), played by Milla Jovovich gives the update we need even if we had released what little emotional attachment we had to the first one.  I give high kudos for the creators in making a movie that actually surpasses the first one in production value and action thrills.  The first was more of a suspense movie, which is fine because the suspense of what they discovered in the first one is gone.  We know what they are up against.

This one is actually more like the video game, an action shoot-em-up where the popular characters come together to fight the `Evil'.  I'm not familiar with the characters from the game but I was intrigued when I saw Jill Valentine smoke up the screen.  Nothing better then to put a hot female cop in a mini skirt, black go-go boots and corset with guns strapped to her hips.  Hello Nurse!

Anyway, the situation in the movie goes from bad to worse as the virus catches up with almost all the characters introduced.  Only a few remain at the end and the finale is actually pretty impressive with a shameless introduction for a third installment.  All in all, this is a good sequel and a great popcorn/action/horror flick with only passable dialogue but well done action sequences and thrills to spare.",1109203200,,1575,4.585714285714285
2448814,3,B000BYRCR4,"I have to confess that I don't play video games - eye-hand coordination and lightning reflexes weren't included in my genetic package, so this review is based on the movie - and nothing but the movie.

Other than Milla Jovovich, no cast member did any real acting.  Michelle Rodriguez had a fairly difficult role to play, but the snarling and eye rolling was just too much at times.  She was necessarily tough, but the dialogue also really let her down. The rest of the cast was on par for a B Grade horror movie, and only slightly more animated than the zombies.

This movie is what happens when you mix too many good things in a haphazard way. Imagine trying to write a coherent script when your ""must"" list includes zombies, were-dogs, sloppy genetic mutations with long tongues, a controlling computer system, an impregnable ""fortress"", a knockout babe with amnesia, a SWAT team, biological warfare, viruses, spies and saboteurs, a battle on a train, and guns - lots of guns.

The zombie scenes failed to impress, no gore to be seen anywhere - they just looked like a typical crowd of people in the mosh pit at a rock concert.  The mutating tissue-thing was straight out of a Dean Koontz book, and most of the suspense scenes weren't very suspenseful, because whatever you expected to happen - did.

On the cool side, you had the wicked lasers to do the slicing and dicing, Alice's (Milla) hot red zombie-kicking slit-way-up the side dress, and the fight scenes.  Many parts may seem familiar, mainly because you've seen scenes just like them in other popular action movies.

Next time let Alice do some Mortal Kombat with Lara Croft and you can call it a Final Fantasy.

2448815,1,B000BYRCR4,"This is terrible!

One of the worst films ever made.

I am a fan of Biohazard(Resident Evil) videogame, and compared to it, this film sucks. Although Anderson is calling himself a ""fan"" of this game, he is not a fan OF THIS game. A TRUE FAN would have never crated something like this.

These are the differences between a videogame and a film:

1 - In film: Nemesis is controlled by a computer(cyborg).

  In game: Nemesis is just smart, and he is not controlled by a computer.

2 - In film: Nemesis is created from the T-Virus(Matt was sliced by licker and infected with the T-Virus)

  In game: Nemesis was created using ""Nemesis Parasite"" and Nemesis Parasite was created in France. Besides most hosts possesed by Nemesis Parasite would die; and the hole process is unstable.....

3 - In film: T-Virus samples are stored in funky capsules made after DNA model.

  In game: T-Virus samples are stored in normal capsules, without any ""cool"" crap.

4 - In film: T-Virus is created by Dr. Ashford to save his dying child.

  In game: T-virus has a very long and twisted story; it was created by Dr. James Marcus by combining leech DNA and progenitor virus (Mother virus) to be used as a weapon.

5 - In film: In the end of the movie Alice can use a power of her mind to kill.(It sucks!)

  In game: There is no Alice; and there is no super crap mind powers.

6 - In film: The whole Raccoon City incident happens because the stupid named ""Hive"" lab was reopened.(Shouldn't the computer tell Umbrella HQ that the T-Virus was leaked?)

  In game: It happens because Dr. William Birkin was asassinated by Umbrella....(Rats were the carriers)

7 - In film: Raccoon City was bombed by Umbrella.(By doing so they tell US goverment that THEY ARE the ones responsible for this incident.)

  In game: It was bombed by US goverment.

There are many other stupidities in the film; and it sure is NOT connected to the game(unlike Anderson said). It's for you to decide if this film is good or not, but a true fan would never buy it.",1109030400,3,2019,4.5069252077562325

Ever since I seen her in ""The Fifth Element"" she is now on my must see list. Brains, brawn and beauty are her traits that cannot be matched. But now that I see Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine) I might have to rethink my reasoning.

""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" continues on the path of the popular video game genre. This film is the second in the series of Resident Evils. The always-curious Umbrella Corporation must open the Hive! Of course this leads to unleashing the T-virus again. Raccoon City is built above the Hive, so the virus spreads faster than oil in water. The Umbrella Corporation cannot stop the virus so the decision is made to quarantine the city and nuke it. But what a better situation to try out their new prototype fighting machine Nemesis.

  A rouge group of cops and civilians roam the streets. They are looking for a way out of the city. When they cross paths they decide to join forces with Alice. But wait, the inventor of the T-virus is looking for his daughter. He strikes up a deal with Alice for their freedom if they can find his daughter.

It is easy to see the PS2 video game elements in this movie.  It flows very well and I personally enjoyed this sequel more than the original.  The addition of Jill Valentine to the mix was an inspiration.  To tell you the truth, she's hotter than Milla.

In this episode, the contagion has broken out in Raccoon City and the population immediately falls victim.  Umbrella Corp isolates the city and ultimately unleashes Alice, who has become a project in and of herself since the last outing.  Umbrella takes advantage of the situation and unleashes Nemesis into the city for a trial run.  Ultimately, he is pitted against Alice.  There is a surprise at the outcome of that match.

Meanwhile, Dr. Ashby wants Alice and company to locate his daughter who was in the process of being evacuated when hell broke lose.  In exchange, he promises to get them safely out of the Raccoon City.

2448826,3,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse (Alexander Witt, 2004)

Resident Evil: Apocalypse may be Alexander Witt's first directorial credit, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have more than enough experience under his belt to direct an action flick. His previous credits include work on such things-blow-up-nicely movies as Pirates of the Caribbean, XXX, Gladiator, and Lethal Weapon 3. So you can go into Apocalypse knowing you're going to get, at least, a solid action flick.

Then you take a look at the cast. Milla Jovovich returns, of course, but much of the rest of the cast are also known for solid action-film work; there's Oded Fehr (The Mummy), Jared Harris (b. Monkey), Sienna Guillory (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Razaaq Adoti (Black Hawk Down), and Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason), among others. Getting away from action films, Sandrine Holt (Black Robe) and Mike Epps (Strays) also jump out of the cast. So you know you have a well-acted solid action flick.

Unfortunately, that's all you get. It's really kind of depressing that one of the few games actually capable of scaring you if played in the right conditions doesn't actually merit a horror film, but there you go. Jovovich reprises her role from the first film, and is here backed up by game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Fehr). The basic plot of the movie is that the three of them, along with a changing roster of hangers-on, have to both survive the city's undead and get out of the now-quarantined Raccoon City for reasons that the viewer's clued into about halfway through the movie. The result, as noted in the rating, is non-stop violence.

Given that, it's surprising how well the film does work on that level. The situation is quite likely to remind you of Predator, arguably the best film Schwarzenegger ever made (and definitely the best film Gov. Ventura ever made); Apocalypse suffers in comparison because the characters don't have anywhere near as much depth, but the action sequences never fail to be just as much fun. I just wish it had more of the outright creepy feel that made Resident Evil 2 (the game) so wonderful. ** ",1107734400,,2117,4.885793871866295

I am a big fan of the games, so this movie was perfect in my eyes.  I thought they did a fantastic job, especially with Nemesis.  I swear it was like he walked out of the video game and into the movie.  The special effects make-up guys are unbelieveably talented!

This movie was a great second to the first. It continued where the first movie left off and kept Milla Jovavich in it which was an added bonus.

It may be somewhat different than the video games but the storyline in the movie was put together very nicely. Definitely a change in pace from the first movie whereas almost everybody dies and now most of them survive. Yet, don't get me wrong. Not everyone makes it out alive or is able to resist the T-virus mutation.

The zombies in this movie were excellant as well. They had a eerieness to them being shot in slow motion (in the beginning) and looked very realistic. As realistic as one would imagine a zombie to be. And, beeing a fan of die hard Horror movies, I have to say that these zombies get 2 thumbs up from me! The director didn't focus too much on them so as not to make this appear as another ""Dawn of the Dead"" movie. He kept up with them and the story line which was great.

I admit, when I first seen Nemisis I was a bit taken back. I couldn't help but thinking the whole movie had just gone down the toilet with an oversize monster. But, having faith in the first Resident Evil and watching on I was quite surprised to see how well they integrated him into the sequel. It was better than to be expected.

Ok that's most of it.

But this film does have the best feel of a movie adapted from a video game. The framing of the story as it progresses using 3D computer animations to show where the various characters are in ""The Hive"", plus the point-of-view (a la ""Preditor"") shots that the central computer ""Red Queen"" sees, give a real gaming ""techno"" gloss to the proceedings.

The music score by Marylin Manson works great. I detest that guy's personna, but I am forced to give him credit here. He did make me laugh once when he said in an interview that at a multi-artist gig he felt he had succeeded if at least he made a few Alannis Morriset fans throw up.

Mainly just the monsters and some of the lab type levels from the first two games are intact, but thats were the comparisons end. Although, to give the director credit, he did say this movie was more of a prequel to the games, rather then a movie version.
  Horror movie wise, there isn't that many great moments in the movie. The zombies are mediocre, I'd take Romero or Jackson zombies over these ones any day.  They're just not that frightning and they don't do a whole lot.  The part with the dogs is fairly decent, but the licker at the end of the movie is just plain laughable and crappy. The budget wasn't very big for this movie, but I've seen TV movies with better special effects then this movies licker. Although I must admit, the part where they're trapped in the corridor with lazers that our out of control, is one of those ""wow"" moments of horror movies.
  The characters are one dimensional and not very fun. Milla doesn't seem to comfortable in her role yet, but that changes in the second movie. Other characters in the movie could live or die without the audience caring much, unless you're like me and would rather just see them all die.

The director uses quick jagged camera movements to obscure the action in the movie and give the moive a ""sense"" of action, but people who are used to the matrix/jackie chane show whats going on aspects of a fight sequnce will be aggrivated with the final show down.

Ontop of that the movie down right STEALS from the various RE stroy lines. and re-writes resident evil 3 completly,.

I much rather have had a RE type story or one that could have ran parrel much like the first movie. In stead we get whole a scene stolen from RE code veronica and they actually look less stunning.

2448842,4,B000BYRCR4,"I can't remember a time when I didn't love Resident Evil.  No other series of video games can even come close to matching the complexity of the story behind RE.  For years, I thought that an RE movie would be truly awesome, and lo and behold, they made one.  Although none of the original characters were involved, I still relished every second of it, and when I heard there was going to be an RE2 movie, I was estatic.

Now, don't get me wrong.  The visuals, the costumes, the characters, the fighting...all are truly awesome in the movie.  There are plenty of surprises, lots of zombies, and even some comic relief.  All in all, the movie itself was quite well done. My issue is with the plot itself.

As all of you hardcore RE fans know, 'Nemesis' is the title, and the subject, of the 3rd RE game.  The second RE game does deal with the scientist's missing daughter, and with a reporter, but the similarity ends there. RE2 (the videogame) follows Leon's and Claire's seperate stories as they try to escape the city: Claire tries to rescue the scientist's daughter, and Leon and the reporter are looking for the G-virus, the new and updated version of the T-virus. Also, the second game brings in more enemies and all kinds of things that would have made for an excellent movie.

I'm thrilled that a third movie is being made, and I hope it follows RE:Code Veronica a little more closely than ""Apocalypse"" followed RE2.  ""Apocalypse"" is still an awesome movie, but fans, be ye warned: the plot might make you a bit angry.",1106092800,,1524,4.545787545787546

P.S. - Does anyone else but me think that Milla Jovovich is a little flat chested?",1106006400,,390,4.342465753424658
2448855,4,B000BYRCR4,"People, if you want fleshed out characters and other cinematic niceties, why on earth would you even watch a movie like this?  It's meant to be an adrenaline rush, a cavalcade of fights and wow special effects.  Who cares about Alice's past?  We get enough from the first movie to fill us in.  This movie delivers what you should expect from this kind of moviemaking.  Milla Jovovich kicks butt in this one, which I think overall is better than the original, which seemed to be nothing more than an extended video game.  This time around we get Alice paired up with the likes of Mike Epps, Oded Fehr, Sienna Guillory and others.  Thomas Krestchmann who was so good in THE PIANIST makes an interesting villain.  There's lots of explosive action and twists and turns.  Its dark ending squeals for a third installment.  So relax enjoy this movie's mindlessness and appreciate the craft that was necessary to pull it off so nicely.",1105920000,,927,4.701863354037267
2448856,3,B000BYRCR4,"As a huge fan of the original games I came to the first Resident Evil movie with fairly large expectations.  Was I disappointed, a little.  As a horror movie it had its moments, as a movie based on a game it wasn't very great.  Although, to lend it some credit, Paul Anderson has said it was more of a prequel to the games rather than based exactly on the games.

Luckily Resident Evil: Apocalypse is based on the games and is a lot better done than the first one. First off, there's a lot more action. To me the first one was far to slow, with not much going on. This one was almost pure action through and through. It had great gun fights and well thought out fisticuffs.

It also played out like the games, with different scenes from the game actually in the movie, which I enjoyed. The Tyrant was well done and didn't look too cheesy like I thought it would.  The zombies were good, although the moments where the director chose to slow down the film to show groups of zombies moving was a total waste.  I couldn't help but think, ""cheesy TV movie"" during those times.  The dogs and lickers were well done, and there's nothing like a creepy classroom filled with zombie children to get some chills wrung out.

Milla Jovavich's character Alice was a big improvement too.  Jovavich had a better grasp of the character this time around and played her with some good old camp too.  She seemed more confident in the role, which worked for the movie.

My only real complaints about the movie where its lack of constant good scares, only one new addition of the monsters from the game(the Tyrant) and lack of gore. For a horror zombie movie you'd expect a little more gore.  Even Shaun of the Dead has more gore than this. But overall, it's a step above the original, and a gigantic leap over other zombie movies based off games.  Yeah, I'm talking about you House of the Dead.",1105920000,2,1874,4.409883720930233

2448858,5,B000BYRCR4,"Face it: game to movie adaptations don't work. They're either way too long and complex that an hour and a half movie doesn't cut it like Final Fantasy, which always need to be long and good 20-40 hours at most, or not enough story so the filmmakers try to make a story out of it like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. Oddly enough, the latter was made by the director of this film also, Paul Anderson. I actually found myself willingly watching Mortal Kombat rather than it being on superstation and nothing else on. His 2nd adaptation is slightly better but still fun.

Meant as a prequel to the first game in which Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield have to fight their way through a zombie-infested mansion, this takes place beforehand where employees of a secret research facility known as the Hive are killed by the computer. Alice(not named till the credits) is then taken by commandos into the Hive to shut down the computer. They also find Spencer and Matt, a cop.

After a rather grisly scene, they shut down the Hive's computer, but that unlocks all the doors and the undead escape. In the research facility, they're developing a biological weapon known as the T-Virus which reanimates dead blood cells but brings them to it's most simplest want: to eat, and they have a taste for blood and flesh, oddly. So they have to make it out of the Hive before they're trapped.

I think one complaint that I have with the film is that it doesn't FEEL Resident Evil. Instead of quiet atmospheric rooms with dim lighting and ambient music, you get full-blown lighting and loud music, courtesy of Marilyn Manson. As far as gore goes, this one's more gorier than the sequel, Apocalypse which was more implied. Here you get decapitations, cut in half and in one scene, guy falling in chunks after meeting a laser grid. Kudos on the ending though, which ends on a nice downnote and sets things up for the sequel.

All in all, it's not going to win an academy award, might incite laughter from the spoken dialogue, but yet just might love it.",1105833600,,2034,4.595041322314049
2448859,3,B000BYRCR4,"Most fans of the Resident Evil videogame series were disappointed by this movie.  I'm not entirely sure why but I found it to be a solid movie which never does anything really wrong.  The special effects are good, the acting isn't bad, the dialogue isn't stupid, the story is good, and there is a fair amount of scares.  All in all, the movie is a little generic and unoriginal but nothing is done badly.

The story is that a secret research facility known as The Hive resides below the city of Raccoon City and someone has unleashed the deadly T-virus within the facility.  This virus amongst other things has the ability to bring the dead back as zombies, flesh eating killers which have the ability to transmit the deadly virus by biting.  A highly trained group of ""special forces"" type guys are sent into The Hive by the Umbrella Corporation to figure out what happen.  Nobody outside knows why facility shut itself down.  The facility is still being controlled by the master AI, which needless to say is a little bit paranoid of the current situation.

In conclusion, I didn't regret watching this movie and have even enjoyed rewatching it several times.  There is no deep meaning, there are no awesome twisted character revelations, there isn't humor, there are no horrendous bloodbaths, but it is a decent action/horror movie that is an okay popcorn muncher.",1105660800,,1366,4.774468085106383
2448860,2,B000BYRCR4,"I have to admit I loved the first film.  It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied.  Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events.  There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality.  I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel.  As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood.  Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place.  More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story.  A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, cliched characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.

To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original.  I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation.  I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood clich instead.  The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse.  His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top).  Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first.  There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall).  This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series.  Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film.  Yet again, who am I to say?  Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end.  It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.

The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clichs to pour in like the flood gates had been opened.  The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present.  The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold.  The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever.  Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas.  YUK.  Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing.  Not just the characters were clich, but also the story.  Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI.  Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load.  Seriously, I would love to know what happened.

I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen.  For any of you that did not, I question your sanity.  The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut.  It was sloppy and cheap.  Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.

Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series.  The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad.  Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless.  I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept.  Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse.  I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.

2448861,2,B000BYRCR4,"Sorry guys, bear with me, this is a long review, but if you want to know why I gave two stars you will have to read the entire thing.

Let me first state that unlike many people, especially fans of the Resident Evil game series, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and although it wasn't anything too special or original, I felt the it was a solid action/sci-fi/zombie/horror movie which never really went wrong.  RE - Apocalpyse however disappointed me numerous times.  I excepted a generic plot, I expected Matrix style action, I expected hordes of zombies, I expected a lot of things, what I didn't expect were some lame scenes and a lazy plot wrap up.

The gist of the story is that a zombie creating virus has infected the Umbrella Corporation's secret research facility known as The Hive which resides underneath the city of Racoon City (the events of the first movie).  Of course a science team goes to reopen the Hive and the bad stuff escapes, no problem there.  All of Racoon City starts to get infected and all kinds of zombie hell is breaking out everywhere.  Alice our main character wakes up in a ""hospital"" after her ordeal from the first movie.  By the time she walks outside the city is already officially screwed.

First the things I liked about the movie, I love the Resident theme, I like the action/fighting scenes, I generally like the characters and the acting, there aren't too many lame quotes, there are some decently frightening scenes and the special effects are about as good as you could ask for.

Now what I didn't like.  *SPOILERS*  Some how Umbrella Corporation in less than 24 hours managed to contain the outbreak within a city seamingly the size of Chicago using 30+ foot walls around the entire city.  Allrighty then, in all fairness the Umbrella Corporation knew the virus had infected the Hive, so prior to entering The Hive they could have and should have had safety measures ready to be deployed if the virus escaped into the city.  Okay I guess I can buy that.

There were naturally a couple of scenes that were lame or dumb, such as Alice jumping via motorcycle into the church where the other characters are battling against some Lurkers, not knowing where she was going to land and who she might squish on the other side.  A little bit reckless, but I'll forgive it as a theatrical flair.  And of course if a zombie/undead resurrecting virus gets lose one of the first things you would put on your site seeing list is a stroll through the cemetary, right?  Well our characters did, and of course the buried zombies don't crawl out of their graves until our characters are right dead smack in the middle of the cemetary.  Sigh... well every horror movie has to have the character stupidity moments and maybe the buried zombies didn't have enough willpower to dig themselves out until they started to smell fresh blood standing right on top of them.  All right I'll forgive that stuff.

Then a semi-side plot to whole movie is the conflict between Alice and Nemesis (a huge T-virus mutant).  The Umbrella Corporation wants to see the two battle it out and test each other.  Allright so the two have a couple semi-random encounters which were actually kinda cool, but then we get towards the end of the movie and their ""battle"" has yet to resolve itself.  So we can't have that.  Rather than have to two stumble across/find each other in some random cool location and end it, an Umbrella Corporation scientist forces the two to literally fight now.  ""You and you step forward and end this.""  I thought for a second I'd stumbled into a ""Mortal Kombat"" movie, I expected at anytime to hear the deep gravely voice utter the word FIGHT.  Needless to say the scene was lame.  Once again however ultimately forgivable due to artistic license.

Now we come to the end.  A horrible disease ravaged a city the size of Chicago, a huge 30 ft wall is erected around the entire city (we are talking miles and miles of wall), newspapers lay scattered through the streets with headlines reading ""THE DEAD WALK"", people struggle to escape the city and many do before Umbrella Corporation puts a stop to it.  To cover this tragedy up Umbrella Corporation touches off a nuclear bomb and claims the power plant had a meltdown.  Fine no problem.

However, some amateur footage of the zombie tragedy ends up in the hands of mainstream news.  Reports of disturbing and shocking footage are aired.  Oh, wait sorry, never mind the whole thing was just a hoax.  All we know is that Racoon City was leveled by a nuclear meltdown.  WHAT?  Are you trying to tell me no one in the outside public knew about this outbreak?  No one noticed the 30 ft wall surrounding a major metropolis?  Newspapers had enough time to release breaking news headlines reading ""THE DEAD WALK"" and nobody outside heard about it or read these articles?  None of the presumably thousands of earlier escapees told anyone about the tragedy?  None of the remaining people not to mention the reporting local news, government or law enforcement groups made a phone call to the outside world to report what was happening and/or ask for aid and/or say there goodbyes to loved ones, especially in the early hours of the outbreak?  How in the world am I supposed to buy that crap?

If you want a cover story say terrorists released a biological/viral disease and before anyone could figure out what was going on, the nuclear plant had a meltdown and obliterated the entire city and any potential explaination of the virus outbreak.  There both horrible tragedies reported and simply explained and resolved.  But no instead the outside world remains completely ignorant of the zombie disease outbreak. Please.  That my friends is why I didn't like this movie.  It makes the whole plot resolution unbelievable.",1105574400,4,5803,4.709325396825397
2448862,4,B000BYRCR4,"Paul Anderson to me is a guy movie director: he doesn't make 3 hour long character studies or big period pieces, he just wants to have 90 minutes to show people kicking ass and blowing s*** up. Story may be very one dimensional, as are its characters, and dialogue may be hokey, but if I turned off my brain, I actually could enjoy this.

Resident Evil the first film was essentially a prequel to the first Resident Evil game which took place in the Spencer mansion. The movie was written to provide a prologue to the game even though there's Resident Evil Zero but oh well.

After the events of the first film, Alice, having woken up from some experiments done to her, she awakes to find Raccoon City looking decimated(kind of like RE2 and 3). Umbrella wants to know what happened in the Hive so they open it's huge doors, bad idea. The ""zombies""(they're not called that in the films) attack the scientists and start to overrun the city. The city people then go to the city's only exit, but someone contracts the virus and turns into one of them. Umbrella decides that it's too dangerous to have the virus this close so they do the next best thing to get rid of it: nuke the city. What follows is a group of people trying to escape without getting infected or killed and rescuing the T-Virus creator's daughter.

The plot is basically Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. There's no mention of William Birkin, Leon, or Claire. It does have Carlos Olivera and Jill Valentine from RE3(the latter also being in the first game). Not an important thing but Jill is HOT. Oded Fehr plays Carlos with a badassness and Milla Jovovich is quite capable in the movie-only character Alice. The big creature is the Nemesis, who transformed from Matt from the first movie. He looks like the game's character and has a rocket launcher and mini-gun.

Instead of Paul directing the sequel, the reins are given to Alexander Witt, a long-time second unit director but first time head director. He sometimes has a tendency to have the fast editing syndrome that plagues a director like Michael Bay with fast shots. This makes the fight with Alice and the Nemesis kind of weird too watch cause he's so damn slow yet it's shot like he's going Bruce Lee on her.

They're making a 3rd one with Paul returning as director. Seeing as how Resident Evil 4 just very recently came out, I'm wondering how it'll have its plot turn out. And here's to having Claire, Chris, Ada and especially Rebecca in the next film. But as for this one, give it a shot since it won't do anything bad and may enjoy it(except if you think the movie sucks).",1105488000,3,2596,4.538461538461538
2448863,1,B000BYRCR4,"Let me first take a second just to say that i have never written a movie review in the past, but i am a person that when extremely pleased or highly dissatisfied often feels the need to say something, so here it is: This movie is without a doubt one of the most worst action/horror/scifi/whatever the hell peice of crap kinda movie you want to call it. What bothered me most outside of the huge plot holes was that this movie was a horrid rip of of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (which i will add was a much better movie by far than this piece of tripe). What the producers of this movie relied on was the fact that the audience they were going after (young males 16-25) probably have never seen or heard of the movie ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK thus wouldnt know that there wasn't one single fresh or original idea in the whole movie. Yes it was nice seeing Alice and Valentie (pretty faces and nice bodies to attract the boys) kick some butt, ill admit, but when you actualy go to the lengths of stealing another persons movie idea you'd think they could at least make the plot work (i.e. to reanimate dead bodies they MUST be infected with the T-Virus, yet when the wayward team are running through a grave yard, corpes come up from the ground. Can someone please tell me how they, 1) got out of ther coffins from 6 feet down, and then tell me how they were infected with the T-virus?)I won't bore you with more details of the dreadfulness of this rip off, my only point was to warn any of you Resident Evil 1 fans that were thinking of picking this up (by the way i did like part one)If you really want to see a better version (AND NOT A RIPPED OF PIECE OF GARBAGE) of what was meant in APOCALYSE, rent or buy ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK with Kurt Russell, i think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1105488000,7,1779,4.235294117647059

  Just another beautiful day in Raccoon City, but underground the Nemesis has escaped.  Important residents in Raccoon City are visited by two agent men from the Umbrella Corporation telling them at their front door, ""There's been an incident"".  They are taken in the van immediately.  Their is chaos going on downtown. Officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Gillory) is called in. She enters the Raccoon City Police Department and kills the bio-hazard zombies.
  As we saw at the end of the first film, we see Alice (Milla Jovovich) unhooking herself from the operating table and leaving the building. She now stands in the middle of downtown Raccoon City where all the turmoil has just ended.
 Later that night, Raccoon City is quarantined. No one is allowed to leave. They must go back home. Valentine, Peyton (Razaaq Adotyi) and Teri (Sandine Holt) are in the church to get away from the zombies. The lickers are running rampant inside. Suddenly, Alice finds a way inside to help.
  Their next mission is to get Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) his daughter, Angela (Sophie Vavasseur), back and he will help them get out of the city.

2448868,3,B000BYRCR4,"If you dug the first Resident Evil film, you'll most likely dig Resident Evil: Apocalypse even more.  Taking place right after the end of the first film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself allied with a few survivors as they try to escape Raccoon City and the unending zombie onslaught.  Paul W.S. Anderson, who had directed the first film, wrote this sequel which is capably directed by first timer Alexander Witt.  The bigger budget allows for better special effects, a more expansive environment, and the appearance of fan favorite video game monster Nemesis.  Video game characters Jill (the oh so hot Sienna Guillory) and Carlos (The Mummy's Oded Fehr) are introduced, and the solid cast is rounded out by Mike Epps, Jared Harris, and Thomas Kretschmann.  However, Apocalypse is really nothing too special, and at times it is quite predictable, although the twist ending is a nice touch, and the door is left open (again) to another sequel.  It's not a waste of film as Roger Ebert described it as upon it's release, but it will depend on the viewer whether or not this is worth a look.",1105056000,,1093,4.818181818181818
2448869,5,B000BYRCR4,"If you felt the first ""Resident Evil"" movie didn't quite capture the atmosphere of the original game, you can sleep a little easier now. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" has EVERYTHING: from dark, creepy graveyards, a gothic cathedral and classic lorries in an ""Escape from New York""- style deserted city to a cigarette smoking Jill Valentine and half naked hooker zombies.

Although this sequel clearly had a much bigger budget than the original film, director Alexander Witt has kept it credible and didn't use digital technology to bombard your senses and keep your mind of the lack of a decent storyline. Rather than making you feel like you're watching a computer- made movie where nothing seems real, the special effects help create a desolate and panicky atmosphere with credible characters who struggle to survive in a city that's infested with their undead compatriots, partially decayed K-9s and other creepy lifeforms. The scene where one survivor has to go up against a class of elementary school zombies is just terrifying.

Unlike the director of the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, Witt and producer/ script writer Paul W.S. Anderson have opted not to follow in the footsteps of the fast- moving ""28 Days Later"" zombies, but has clearly been inspired not only by George Romero's view of walking corpses, but also by his opinion of our western society. The real evil in this movie is not the zombies or even the killer mutant Nemesis (who looks and sounds like he has just stepped out of the original game and into this movie), but a Big Brother- style multinational that puts itself above the law and has no respect whatsoever for morale, decency or anything human.

Even if you've never played the video game, didn't like the first ""Resident Evil"" movie or don't care for a lot of high tech military action in a horror film, I'd still highly recommend you take the time to watch this one. If you liked both the 1978 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Aliens"", you're going to love ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". Besides, if internationally acclaimed Milla Jovovich agreed to add it to her rsum of, among others, ""the Fifth Element"", ""the Messenger: the Story of Jean of Arc"" and ""the Million Dollar Hotel"", it has to be good!",1105056000,11,2229,4.84514435695538

Bad writing, acting and the action set pieces are mind numbingly crappy and non exciting. This sequel takes place right after the original in the desolate town of Racoon City where the virus has spread even more and the inhabitants become zombies.

2448873,4,B000BYRCR4,"It almost seems a prerequisite now for certain movies to spawn all kinds of aftermarket merchandising, specifically video games (usually sucky ones at that).  But to make a feature length film based on source material taken from a video game?  Seems poor prospect (who remembers 1993's Super Mario Bros?  Or how about 1994's Street Fighter?  Man, those were some awful times), but then again I come from a time when video games were pretty simplistic, and had little or no story.  Nowadays, the technology has allowed for extremely well developed storylines within games, and the likelihood of seeing the transition from game consoles to the big screen becoming more and more common.  I mean, look at it like this, if a game sold how many million copies, you pretty much already have a large fan base more than eager to watch a film based on said game.  A built in audience...how can you go wrong?  Well, if you deviate from the storyline, or screw up various elements or characters, you may end up with a fairly rabid pack of angry fans looking for blood...Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004), sequel to 2002's Resident Evil film, was written by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, AVP: Alien Vs. Predator), and directed by Alexander Witt, a man who has a ton of 2nd director (this is the guy responsible for filming shots of less importance, such as inserts, crowds, scenery, etc.) credits to his name, but makes his directing debut here.  Returning in her role as Alice from the first film is Milla Jovovich (as far as I can tell, she was the only one who made it into the sequel).  Also appearing is Sienna Guillory (Love Actually), Oded Fehr (Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, The Mummy), Mike Epps (Friday After Next, The Fighting Temptations), and Matthew G. Taylor (Gothika, Detroit Rock City) as Nemesis.

The film begins with Umbrella agents in full biohazard gear opening up The Hive, with predictable results (The Hive was a ginormaous, underground research facility that was sealed due to contamination in the first film).  This leads to the T-virus (the contaminate that has the ability to re-animate the dead) to spread into Raccoon City, forcing the Umbrella Corporation, owner of not only The Hive but the city as well, to quarantine the city, sealing many uninfected residents with all kinds of walking dead, many vicious mutations seen in the first film, along with a few new ones.  Alice, joined by a small band of survivors, now trapped inside the city, makes a deal to retrieve the young daughter of a scientist in return for safe passage out of the quarantined area.  Only problem is, besides the legion of hungry undead roaming the streets and hideous, nasty, bitey creatures on the prowl, the Umbrella Corporation has ideas of their own, seeing the situation as a perfect opportunity to test out their latest bio-weapon, Nemesis.  Oh yeah, there's also plans to nuke the city...time is running out (along with their ammunition), for the small group, but they do have an edge, namely, in Alice, as she is more than she appears...

Now you don't have to see the original to enjoy this sequel, as the makers of the film provide a certain amount of back-story at the beginning, but you probably should to get the full flavor.  I really wasn't expecting a lot seeing as how this was a sequel and we all know sequels rarely meet the level of the original that spawned said sequel, so I was pleasantly surprised when the film turned out to be pretty good, well, good in the sense that it's a movie based off of a video game.  And that's what I think people should keep in mind, especially those disappointed at the lack of substance within the plot.  A majority of the plot actually extends from the first, setting things up for this picture, which is heavy on action, light on nearly everything else.  I thought the actors did a pretty good job (that Sienna Guillory is one fine, hotsy totsy momma, playing the role of Jill Valentine).  I especially enjoyed Mike Epps as the urban civilian caught up in forces way beyond his control, relating some truly funny lines in a completely realistic manner.  I normally despise comic relief characters, as they're often played so ridiculously over the top that they distract more than anything else, but that wasn't the case here.  The one aspect I disliked the most about the film was the excessive, epileptic, herky jerky camera work and quick cutting, meant to heighten the tension during the more action filled scenes, but it just served to annoy the heck out of me.  This type of direction can be effective in smaller doses, but it's used too often here, and may cause some viewers to reach for the Dramamine.  Also, I thought it odd that every time the undead were shown, their shots were often marred by jittery cutting, as if to highlight something (I don't know what), but it made me wonder if it was done to draw away from the detail, or lack of, concerning the make up of the characters.  There were quite a few characters in this film, each seeming to have their own, little storyline going, but then they're unified nicely once their goals become shared.  The special effects are very slick, and the action rarely slows down, and there's lots of guns, gunfire, explosions, things getting blown up (blown up real good).  I thought the film a little short (it does list a 94 minute running time), but the ending sets up for a possible sequel.

I won't bother listing all the special features as Amazon details them nicely, but I will say the picture and audio were excellent.  This is a two disc set, the first DVD containing the film (both widescreen and full screen format), along with some special features, with the 2nd containing the bulk of the extras. 3  stars

2448884,3,B000BYRCR4,"I liked the first ""Resident Evil"" better.  I liked the way it opened and the entire idea of people having to go back into the Hive to find out what happened and look for survivors.  There is something to be said for the inherent tension in having to keep going forward when you should be turning around and getting the hell out of Dodge as quick as possible.  ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is about the getting the hell out of Dodge, or in this case Raccoon City, but there is a major problem in terms of the as quick as possible part, especially given that the city is about to be nuked.

The Umbrella Corporation decided to reopen the Hive, which allows the T-virus to escape and turn the inhabitants of Raccoon City into zombies.  I might be slow when it comes to modern science, but I really fail to see the practical applications or economic potential of the T-virus given that it is not really regeneration human cells.  Now the nuke option is making a lot of sense, which is bad news for Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically created ultimate fighting machine, who is trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombies to safety.  But since this movie is based on a video game, things get worse.  The Umbrella Corporation sends Nemesis, a killing machine that may or may not be a genetically mutated version of Alice's boyfriend, Matt, from the previous film.  Apparently shooting people before nuking them is in the best interest of the corporation.  Go figure.

Alice at least has some decent allies this time around, with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a demoted cop who is pretty good given that she has no genetic enhancements, and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), who leads what is left of an elite tactical team.  Weather reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) is as close as we get to the damsel in distress with this group, and she is not stupid.  The group has a glimmer of hope in that there is a scientist, Dr. Asher (Jared Harris), who created the T-virus and is wired into the city security system so that he can help them take the ""easy"" through zombie town.  All they have to do is rescue his daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), who was left behind.  So this is the ""Resident Evil"" equivalent of trying to get out of zombie town with one hand tied behind your back.

I understand that there are a lot of things in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" that are lifted from the various ""Resident Evil"" video games, but all of that is lost on me.  I am sure that this adds another dimension of enjoyment to the film, just like when I watch a ""Spider-Man"" movie and talk about what shots are taken from which cover by which artist.  A lot of this stuff is explained in the various commentary tracks, so there is ample opportunity to play catch-up, but it would all work a lot better if you have actually seen the video games.  The bad news is that the sequel seems much more like a video game as the survivors fight zombies, and then they fight mutant creatures, and then they fight the Umbrella Corp., and then they go through the whole cycle again.

Taking the movie out of the Hive and up to the streets works against the tension and the terror, even when you throw in the zombie strippers (yeah, it sounds like a good idea, but it really is not).  I think the characters are more interesting this time, mainly because their collective competence level is a lot higher than the first film, but this is yet another film that turns the lights down low and edits like crazy to achieve its effects.  I am so sick and tired of movies resorting to that approach instead of just letting us see what is going on.  But this is a movie that really does not have much respect for the intelligence of its audience, all of whom would know to shot zombies wearing body armor in the head.  At least the movie makes the videogames look really good in comparison, so there is that.  You just have to be into playing the games.",1104969600,49,3925,4.478932584269663
2448885,4,B000BYRCR4,"As far as shlocky zombie films go the R.E. franchise is my favorite. I did perfer the first one.
As a ""Torontoian"" I have to say it was fun to watch if a bit hard to suspend disbelief I found that I had to keep telling myself ""that's not Toronto City all It's Racoon City City Hall... or that's not the CN Tower in the background, pretend it's not there.""
I think that dispite what the reviewer said the visuals were well done, I enjoyed the fact that ""real"" effects were used where it was not ablsoutly nessisary to use CGI ie. Milla Jovovich's (Alice) stunt double running down the side of city hall and Milla doing the last 60 feet herself, this was all done in real time and not on a blue/green screen nor CG.
If you expect Citizen Kane from this movie then perhaps you aught to rethink you choice in Genre. It's a *Bleeping* horror/action/sci-fi flick for goodnessakes not high art.
The DVD special features are fantastic also 3 comentaries, the one with Milla, Sienna, and Oded kept me chuckling Milla has a fantastic sense of humor.

Milla Jovovich did manage to learn one thing about acting: she surrounded herself in the sequel with actors of such a caliber that in comparison is an Oscar caliber performance.  Yes, everyone else in the movie is that bad (although they do have wonderfully stereotypical accents).

The plot is also so disjointed to lose all logic.  First a virus is unleashed around the city so the evil corporation puts a wall around the city to keep the zombies in.  Makes sense so far, but for some reason they put mercenaries in the midst of the city for no discernable reason other then to provide ready victims.  And from there the plot continues to flounder.  What ultimately ruins plot is that is composed of specific action sequences taken from the games with a narrative designed to bridge the gap.  A big mistake.

The ending of Apocalypse (following the final battle) is the best part of the movie.  It promises a sequel that escapes the shackles of the game series.",1104796800,,1230,4.827751196172249

I've heard that the movie was better for people who haven't played the games, and must agree. I was told more about the storyline (What, I'm not telling you- What, are you too lazy to play the game?!) and it was quite different with other characters and whatnot.

Overall the visuals were decent and it ""didn't get boring"" at all. The only thing I didn't like was the final fight scene where the cameras were switching back and forth and it was a bit disorienting.

Nemesis was wonderfully portrayed but should of had a bigger part. His rocket launcher was also very entertaining...

2448893,5,B000BYRCR4,"first, an action horror movie is a great concept. to put resident evil as one, and even better concept. now some people didn't like the first because it didn't have much to do with the first game. that was the point of paul anderson, he was trying to breate a prelude to the story, there is nothing wrong with that except when he was making the film he didn't know that resident evil 0 was being made. oh well, what can you do. the movie is still a good movie.

the motive was to figure out what happened and now that they were stuck, they had to get out. the wasn't slow anywhere, it was a good fast paste movie for not having a lot of action in it.

now the second movie, a tab bit less story, but still had a story to keep it motivated and not to be dull (slow moving or to drag the story out) at any parts. some parts seem redone in other movies, like the graveyard scene with the dead coming out of the graves. well is resident evil 3 the game this happenes, and what is the movie based on? can anyone help me here... THE GAME! that's right! so not only is it a great action sequence, but also taking from the game as well for the fans. this is how you make good action movies and people will not relize that this is one. has there been a good action movie lately without a bunch of CG effects in it that makes it look cartoonish? this movie uses alittle, but it mostly stunts, and that is how most of them should be.

people don't like this movie because they usually don't like action movies about defeating the bad guy. these movies serve there purpose, i like action movies, but you should see my collection, i own 13 going on 30, why, because i likes the plot and the story was good and held up well, i also own the wedding singer and other comedies. good will hunting all the way to the terminator for God sakes! the point of the is i don't select movies by action or whatever, i judge on how they are put together.

resident evil 1 and 2 are put together good, and give you a rush of action and quick story telling enough to make a good movie, but someparts you might now want to be eating spagetti for dinner, try some tums or gingerale.

if you get upset at some people for saying it is a bad movie just remember they probably never watched it. and also rememnber, resident evil made 200 million dollars and the second film made just about that. these movies are here to stay for at least a third and they already set the date for it for 2006, so start getting excited! resident evil: afterlife is the name for it now, but it could change at anytime. resedent evil apocolypse had 3 names before it was finished.

ok, i hoped this helped and made more knowledge for you. by the way i played all the games too and beat them all. if people say bad things, whatever they just hate themselves and there lives and have nothing to live for or benefit other people. have fun with life, but don't do stupid things. buying used movies from amazon.com makes me feel better. if you don't like the movie then you don't, but it doesn't mean it's stupid. over 400 million dollars gross for 2 movies says something, hey people like them, you don't? don't watch 'em and shut up.",1104624000,7,3175,4.19672131147541

Yes the 'final battle' is as terrible as you've heard, featuring a different camera angle about every 1 to 2 seconds for most of its duration, which will probably leave you dizzy and disoriented instead of thrilled.

Nemesis looks awesome and Jill looks hot, just like the video game.  It's not as scary as the first one, but it's still good.  The only thing I thought was missing was the creepy electronic soundtrack by Marilyn Manson.  He should of done the music for this movie, it would of been even better.

2448896,2,B000BYRCR4,"Mostly everyone knows that rarely does a sequel live up to the expectations that its previous installment set up for it. Don't get me wrong there have been quite a few sequels/trilogies that have created legacies for themselves,..the Resident Evil series on the other hand seems to be moving towards disaster. The first installment of the series, Resident Evil, was excellent in my opinion, the story was told in a manner that left you yearning for more and kept you somewhat in suspense. Resident Evil also left you with a cliffhanger wondering what's going to happen next, thus wanting to see the sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I actually waited a few days after viewing the first Resident Evil to see RE: Apocalypse because I thought the first one was done so well that it will be better if I wait to view the second film. So I watched it and honestly can say that I have no reaction, the was absolutely no plot and if you can try to point one out it is probably a very silly one. It seems as if the writers just wanted to push another installment out so they can get to the next one and create a collectors edition box set. Milla defiantely was not aas appealing in the second film as she was in the first Resident Evil. I don't know but a very attractive woman who seems innocent at first then kicks arse later on in the movie is very sexy. In Apocalypse you already know that Milla kicks [...] so theres no suprise and she looks a little brutish while doing so. Kinda turned me off, The character Jill Valentine was very appealing but I feel she got robbed of a decent portrayal, I was confused throughout the movie as to who she was as there was a very brief intro to her. Overall the film was trying to hard to outdo its previous and failed miserably. There was too much focus and shooting 'em up and not enough story or plot. So a comment to the director/producers, in the next film remember that maybe fans watching the Resident Evil films actually enjoy a good plot and are not mindless like the zombies wandering within the film.",1104624000,2,2045,4.441489361702128

I loved the first installment, it wasn't based on the games but it had the same feel to it, but Apocalypse is a disjointed montage of things that happened in various games.  Sure I didn't mind many of the inconsistencies to the game to the movie, but get someone who understands how a Beretta operates, the slide locks in place when you're out of ammo.  My biggest issue was the ending, everything made sense how you wouldn't want the story getting out but I think that Paul W.S. Anderson forgot about events in the cold war that led to the establishment of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) there purpose to track missiles...  Translation you can't nuke the city and get away with it, NORAD has our backs.  Then the refusal to use any other mutant other then Lickers is insulting to the far superior Hunter's of almost every Resident Evil game, 6 foot tall killer decapitating frogs just never gets old.  If you didn't know anything about Resident Evil other then it had zombies and lots of guns then yes you might like this insult to Resident Evil fans but a die-hard such as myself, I had a hard time with number Apocalypse, and when it comes to the next one im going to pretend that the first was the only movie.",1104624000,2,1368,4.452

There's this super woman, this group of people, a mad scientist and a monster guy and they all run around shooting stuff. There, you don't need to see it now. My favorite scene is when this super sexed up cop enters a room with a little girl and there are zombies in the room and the girl is scared but the cop says not to worry because the zombies are slow and they can just run right around them. HAHAHAHA! That takes any kind of threat out of zombies right there. End the movie now. But no. It drags on through this plot that makes absolutely no sense. Somebody explain to me what the point is of scientists making two monster people and making them battle each other. There's no suspense in this movie, no drama, horrible acting, so-so special effects and no story what so ever.

And the zombies...oh my God this amateur director uses slow motion and some cheesy blur effect to make them ""scary""!!! Terrible. My advice is rent Shaun of the Dead or the brilliant Dawn of the Dead remake if you want to see a fun zombie movie.

This movie is NOTHING like the game OR the books.

*** This comment may contain spoilers ***

the only way you'll like this movie depends on 2 things.........1 your unfamiliar with the games and/or you just want a good shoot em up zombie movie.but if your a fan of the games your gonna be brought to tears.the only thing that resembles the game are a few action scenes taken away from the games.and 4 characters from the game,jill,carlos,nicholai,nemesis.but their not fleshed out at all.which makes the casual viewer think that they never had depth to begin with which is so far from the truth it isn't funny.

also the creepy atmosphere of the game was utterly annihilated in the name of action.which WAS cool but in a cheesy way.nemesis could have been a great character till he turned into a [...] at the end. plus the one on one fight with alice is horrible if it had stayed a gun Battle then it would have been acceptable.

umbrella motives isn't fleshed out unlike the games.plus alice is really an intruding character sense she's not in the game she just doesn't fit.she messes up the dynamics of the original resident evil characters.its as if a girl wrote a fan fic and abruptly put herself as the center piece of the story.at least she should have stayed separate from the others going on her own path like another reviewer mentioned.also there's others that don't fit the lil girl,is a rewrite of another character central to the 2nd game,nicholai is also a very important player,as is carlos and Jill and S.T.A.R.S but like i said their not fleshed out.but if you haven't played the games do your own research to see what i'm talking about.because the adaptation inaccuracies are too numerous to mention here

now judging the game on its own merits.........if your just looking for a light action shoot'em up slash horror pic this might hold you over.though i must admit that the first movie did have a level of more darkness and tension then this one(though not much).but like i said all in all if your unfamiliar with the games and/or you just want a good shoot em up zombie movie this is for you.but if your a fan of the games your gonna be brought to tears.",1104451200,,2152,4.62303664921466
2448915,3,B000BYRCR4,"I had heard a lot about Resident Evil - Apocalyse before I had a chance to see the movie. Most of the folks I spoke to fell into one or two categories. They either loved the movie or hated it. I, on the other hand, had more ambivalent feelings. IMHO the first movie was much better. Though, Apocalypse does have some redeeming qualities...mainly the dead dogs are back in action. There is nothing better then zombie canines.

The movie picks up where the last left off. T-virus has spread and chaos reigns all over Raccoon City. The evil Umbrella Corporation is doing all it can to contain the virus, but it's spreading faster then anyone could imagine. In an effort to study the disease, and keep it from spreading, the corporation has sealed off the city. It's then that the real action begins.

Resident Evil is full of action. There a lot of things blowing up, bullets flying, and plenty of people dying and re-animating. Not to mention, there is a huge terminator-esque bio-weapon running around.

I didn't find the movie too trying. But, overall the entire venture was short on plot. Events, people and circumstances were left virtually unexplained. Most of the acting was sub-par and just when you think the movie is over it starts off with another crazy hypothesis. It's like the neverening story...and I mean this truly.

I wish I could give this movie more then three stars, but it just doesn't deserve it. Though, the soundtrack is again superb Milla J. returns as Alice. That in it of itself is worth something.",1104451200,,1523,4.692883895131086
2448916,4,B000BYRCR4,"Picking up the dvd today I had some anticipation that this would be just as good as the first one. I saw this in the theater and it enjoyed it then. This is better than the first movie, which I thought was good. Good story, good acting, good action!

If you are a fan or at least familiar with the video game storyline you will easily pick up the references in this chapter. The first movie was a prequel and this one is taken directly from the source. Watch carefully and you will get them all.

As a movie, this is your big action popcorn movie with some sci-fi in it. If you are a zombie fan you will find there are some tense moments but nothing like Dawn Of The Dead. It only lacks in the tension put out by the game where you can't see beyond a closed door. Other than this setback it is action packed and will keep you going!

Jill valentine makes her first appearance straight from the Resident Evil 2 finally. She adds a nice compliment to alice from the first film. The subplot of Umbrella starts to also come full circle. Very Good! Go rent it or buy it!",1104364800,,1065,4.160194174757281

2448918,5,B000BYRCR4,"When you glance at many of the sequels to good movies, you would say that the sequel should have never been made. In this situation, this way of thinking is not the case at all! Milla Jovovich returns in this sequel to ""Resident Evil"" as Alice. She does such an amazing job with her character and was more than willing to do many of her own stunts during the filming of this movie. Another aspect that many gamers will find appealing is the fact that this movie is even more like the video game. Also, on that note, Nemesis looked absolutely amazing in this film. I loved what they had done with his character and (a personal favorite of mine) Nemesis' weapons. It totally took my breath away to see how well Nemesis was done for this movie. It was truly amazing. Non-stop action throught the movie. If you are in for one non-stop action ride, then ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is the movie for you to enjoy.",1104364800,2,907,4.437125748502994
2448919,5,B000BYRCR4,"This has to be one of the best sequels.  I have seen few sequels that have been able to outdo the first parts.  Spider-man 2 has done it, and so has Blade 2.

This movie will make the gaming fans very happy, ast this movie takes a lot after the game.  When you watch it, you'll know right away.

I hear that Milla Jovovich did most of her stunts in the movie, unfortunately not the 200-foot building rundown.  I think the fact that the actors do their own stunts add to the quality of the movie.

Now I'm not a guy, so I'm not gonna say that the nudity was hot or anything, but the circumstance in the movie, I can't really put it down.  Although a guy taking his shirt off would have made me like it more.  So any bashing on this part, get a life.

One thing these 1-3 star reviewers need to realize is that THIS IS NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE.  It's based on a virus and many monsters.  There's the Lickers, the dogs (which are sort of zombie dogs, but not really), Nemesis, and the LIVING DEAD. If this movie was made to compete with Dawn of the Dead then I'm sure it would have kicked that movie's [...].

Milla Jovovich played Alice so well, it's hard to put her character down.  As far as her fight scenes, I love her battles with Nemesis the most.  Her character became cockier, too, but it adds to the whole movie.  Whenever I see a girl thats kicking major [...], that's a major plus in a movie.

As far as the movie being racist, whatever.  Sure, the movie was made just to show a dominant race.  I'm sorry, but I liked the ""only"" black character in the movie, he added comic relief from the whole suspense-action theme.

This movie is non-stop action.  I don't even have to jump around scene to scene to get to my favorite part.  Everything rules.  But I do have to say, the first movie was more storyline and all with the fake marriage, the Hive, and everything else.  This one is all action, but it does have a decent storyline.  I won't put it down because I actually like more action than plot.

Is it just me, or was Alice's character a little flirty in this one, too?  Just by the looks and everything she gave him while they were in the car.  Hmmm... Maybe part 3 will be a little more romantic, although I don't see how that could work in this type of movie, so I'm not getting my hopes up, hehe.

If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading, or you'll ruin the ending.

I am psyched that they left it open for a part 3, which is supposed to be called ""Resident Evil : Afterlife""  Hopefully, they really bring out Alice's character, now that she's supposed to be even more, uh, for the lack of a better word, ""enhanced.""  The end scene was awesome.  I do admit, I was a little scared when that thing went through her chest.  But then I thought, she's full of that T-virus.  All in all, I  can't wait to see what Project Alice is all about.

So if you are an action fan, or play the video games, this movie will get 5 stars from you, too.  But like another reviewer said, don't watch it to point out the flaws.  That will only ruin the movie.",1104364800,,3051,4.168096054888507
2448920,4,B000BYRCR4,"First, I haven't picked up the DVD yet so I can't comment on the extras, although from reading the product description, it looks like it's gonna be really cool. I did see it in the theaters twice, so my comments will focus on the movie itself.
I was a big fan of the first movie, even though the storyline and the characters didn't have anything to do with the game series. The second one not only has all the elements that made the first one so cool, but now it actually takes place in Raccoon City. So, now you get a real perspective of what the game might actually look like in real life. Nemesis is just bad ass, definitely the coolest part of the movie. Milla Jovovich spent some long hours in the gym, because she is seriously toned. Sienna Guillory (Jill) is real nice on the eyes too, with her hourglass figure and tight fitting clothes. There's more Zombie creatures, too. The dogs are back, and while there was one licker in the first one, now there's a bunch of them. There's a lot more zombie people, too. Of course, also there's Nemesis. The action is pretty awesome too. You know how in the trailer they show Alice running down the side of the building? She also manages to kill four or so guards at the bottom without skipping a beat. There's also more humor in the movie. Mike Epps plays the wisecracking token black guy (as much as I hate stereotypes, that really is his character) and manages to pull off the bulk of the comic relief. I was very pleased with this sequel.
Now, I would have loved to give this movie 5 stars but I just couldn't, for 2 reasons. First, I was disappointed to hear that Paul Anderson wouldn't be back in the director's chair for this one. I'm a huge fan of Mortal Kombat and AVP. It was hard for me to picture the movie done by anyone else. Nonetheless, I gave it a good chance. My synopsis is, this director is just not as good. During the fighting scenes, the cameras were shaking like someone was making a home movie. Very annoying. Plus, it was hard to see the details on the zombies because the cameras were blurred when they were being shown. Not very high quality.
Second reason is what happens with Nemesis at the end. Alice has a final fight with him and, well I don't want to give it away but the way they wrote it was very cheesy and sappy.
Overall, this one is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the games, or a fan of the first movie, or even just a fan of horror/action flicks in general.
By the way, there will be a third movie! It's going to be called Resident Evil: Afterlife and prodution is scheduled to start in 2005. I don't know about you guys, but I'm really psyched.",1104364800,2,2650,4.312625250501002
2448921,5,B000BYRCR4,"When Resident Evil : Apocalypse was finally announced for it's theatrical release, no one was more excited than me. Being both a fan of the games, and a fan of the first movie, I had high expectations for what this one could be, and it did indeed live up to what I expected.

It seems my main complaint with the first movie, that it didn't have anything to do with the characters or events or the game, were taken care of in the sequel. Jill Valentie (Sienna Guilloy) makes her big screen debut as she bursts onto the screen as one of the bad-ass gunslinging heroines. She doesn't seem very much like the Jill from the RE games, but she dresses and looks very similar to her. My only question left would be, Where's Chris? Instead of Chris we get Carlos (Oded Fehr) who's an alright character. Doesn't seem to really stand out or be that special though. All the questions from the first movie are also effectively answered in the second. The T-Virus has broken out into Raccoon city, and now it's citizens are in mass paranoia. Umbrella has to contain the incident by isolating the virus or destroying the city. Alice (Milla Jovovich) the heroine from the last movie awakes in the lab where we saw her in the last movie. She then removes the cords from her body and walks out into the street and grabs a shotgun from a crashed police car (much like in the ending of the last movie). Alice ends up coming into contact with Jill and some others during her quest to get out of the city. Eventually the programmer of the T-Virus, Dr. Ashford, calls Alice and Jill and makes a deal with them that if they can get his daughter from the Junior High, he will help them escape. This is where the movie really surprised me, because I guess my brain just didn't make the connection between Ashford and the first movie. I mean he's not even in it. But we all remember the little red girl who was the image of the computer in the first movie? Well guess who doctor Ashford's daughter is? It's quite surprising to see her in real life, but as soon as I heard her talk, my brain mad the connection. So now you have some background knowledge, so that you will catch that. The main villian of the movie is Nemesis. If you've seen the last movie you remember at the end where Matt and Alice are coming out of the mansion and then a group of umbrella workers surround them. They see Matt mutating and then say ""Put him in the Nemesis program"". Much of the movie has to do with Alice remembering Matt, and now seeing him as Nemesis. You'll quickly learn that Alice and Nemesis have ultimately been programmed to fight eachother, and see who is the greater power. Perhaps the funniest part of the entire movie though is the black pimp guy. Sorry I don't know his name, but you'll know him when you see him. The things he says are just hilarious, and it's no wonder that they keep him around the whole movie, like when a stars officer trys to hand him a gun and opens his jacket to show to custom made golden guns, and he says all his stuff is custom. The movie once again had a very interesting story, and even more action than the first, which will appeal to all of you who liked the fight scenes in the first. The ending though is another cliff-hanger, because it's ending leaves a question that has to be answered.

Does this mean another RE movie? We can only hope. So if you've seen this in the theatre and liked it, pick it up, the bonuses are worth it. If you've seen the first, but missed the second, pick it up also. And if you don't like Resident Evil at all, then why the hell are you reading this review? Get out of here.",1104364800,,3612,4.3181148748159055
2448922,3,B000BYRCR4,"Milla Jovovich's character from the first is back in Resident Evil Apocalypse. The first one ends with her and another survivor being taking in and genitcally altered. Which makes Jovovich a hell of a lot quicker and stronger. The plot in the sequel has her and other survivors stuck in Racoon city with zombies all over the place. A scientist says he can get them out of the city if they find his lost daugher there.

  There's tons of action in the movie and Jovovich is in great action form. The movie isn't anywhere near as being a good of a zombie movie as 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead or even....Shaun of the Dead. It's still fun though and even better than the first. I think critics such as Ebert & Roeper were way too hard on the movie. It ends making it obvious that a part 3 will be coming soon. Although I liked it, Dawn of the Dead ended making me wanna see more. Resident Evil Apocalypse's ending didn't really make me care whether there's another one or not. Then again part one's ending didn't make me wanna see more either...",1104278400,,1045,4.348717948717948
2448923,4,B000BYRCR4,"Like one person said on here, the movie is great, but it seemed to be missing something. I wished the film focused more on the lickers, zombies, and Nemesis. Although it did a good job covering two of the three but it still seemed like the movie still could have done better. Was there a tighter budget compared to the first film?

Anyways, I thought the story was about average for a film of this type. Nothing that will really surprise anyone.

As for the characters, Milla Jovovich's character does steal the show but as we quickly learn, she is kind of the center of the movie. The acting though is just great! Definitely worth mentioning.

Overall Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a great film. But it just seemed like something was missing. The movie could have been longer and focused more on the zombies, lickers, and Nemesis. But for what was given on the silver screen, it is satisfying. The DVD has a plethora of extras on it as well so you shouldn't get bored with it. Definitely worth a look if you are a fan of this kind of stuff.",1104278400,,1040,4.43455497382199

I enjoyed the ethical issues pertaining to Umbrella's cover up stories, etc, and I think it had a lot to offer besides a ""bunch of good guys killing zombies"".  I also enjoyed Milla Jovovich in this film.  Is she Oscar-worthy?  Well, no, but if you're looking for an Oscar contender, this isn't Titanic, ok?  I forget that she basically has had zero movies and, from being a supermodel to an actress, I think she's doing a pretty good job.  Plus, how awesome is it that she's a girl and kicks so much butt?

  I definitely think this movie was worth renting.  In my opinion, it's not a waste of time.  I also, on a side note, thought 28 Days Later sucked in a big way, and the Resident Evil movies were much better.  How is 28 Days Later going to completely rip off Resident Evil and then call itself original?  At any rate, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this film.",1104278400,,1022,4.310526315789474
2448935,5,B000BYRCR4,"Let me start off by saying I'm not a major fan of American action flicks or comic book movies. Although, I love Hong Kong action, sci-fi horror and zombie flicks. I'm an older guy so I remember seeing the original DAWN OF THE DEAD in 1978. It's still the greatest horror movie ever made. But, don't compare this with other zombie flicks. IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND IT'S BASED ON THE GAME. I've also played most of the RESIDENT EVIL games and I have to say, this is the HOTTEST VIDEO GAME MOVIE FRANCHISE going. Some of the scenes are straight out of the games. The first RESIDENT EVIL flick was great, but this one only enhances the first film.

Yes, RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE is a popcorn action flick. Let's face it, they didn't make this movie for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. This one is strictly for the gamers and action fans. And I can understand why people don't like it. But, if you're into the technical aspects of films making and you love action, I beg you to take another look at this film. (Of course, you need to see RESIDENT EVIL first. Otherwise, you may be lost.)

One of the things that really blew me out of the back of the movie theater and my living room was the action direction by Alexander Witt. This guy really knows his stuff. This is his first feature, but he's done a lot of second unit action directing on films such as MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE is 90 minutes of non-stop action. There are some good John Woo moments in this, too. The bullet spray from the Nemesis' mini-gun is exquisite. Watching that concrete splash behind Milla Jovovich is sheer poetry. LOVING IT!!

But what ultimately sets this film apart from standard sci-fi action flicks is the EDITING. I studied this film hard the second time I watched the DVD. IT REALLY IS A MARVEL of MONTAGE, STORYBOARDING, JUMP CUTS, FAST EDITS, DISSOLVES, and EFFECTS EDITING. All I can say is WOW!! It is hyper-kinetic, which I know, turns a lot of people off. But, if you like the new wave of hyper-kinetic action film, you're gonna love this.

The art direction is superb and even the story was intriguing. There are some plot holes, but hey, it's a COMIC BOOK and I made up some of my own exposition. A Global Corporation named UMBRELLA with too much power and money experimenting with BioWeapons and expenable, genetically enhanced humans. Something to think about when you have a government in this country that has experimented with mind-control, telepathy, remote viewing, and God only knows what else. Some conspiracy theorists believe that AIDS was a bioweapon virus that got out of control. RESIDENT EVIL has the T-Virus. The story hits hard in the wake of the discovery of the human genome, cloning, and biological warfare. Remember, science fiction sometimes becomes science fact. And, corporations are out of control. So the whole notion of a corporation, probably funded by the military, making viral superweapons out of soldiers sends chills down my spine. Although, the Nemesis brought me back down to Earth. He's a scream. There's also a media cover-up at the end that's more plausible than you can possibly imagine. Good stuff.

After watching the DVD extras, (and there's a bunch), you get to see how much work the actors, stunt people, and effects people, went through to make this flick. Even the extras went to zombie school. The actors participated in hours of weapons and martial arts training. Milla Jovovich wanted to do the free fall stunt where her character, Alice, runs over 200 feet down the side of the Toronto City Hall building, but director Witt talked her out of it. A stuntwoman did the big drop. Milla does make the last 60 feet of the fall, which looked quite intense, herself. (I climb telephone poles for a living. 60 feet is high!!) The weapons are all real. The mini-gun that the Nemesis character uses in the film was custom made and brought down from it's original weight of over 100 lbs. to 70 lbs. for the actor William G. Taylor who stands over 6 foot 7. The first time he shot it, it actually knocked him back from the recoil. NOW THAT'S GETTING INTO THE ROLE, MAN. When you watch all the pieces that went into the making of the flick you'll realize what a labor of love it was for all of those involved. THANKS, GUYS. I LOVED IT!! I watched it back-to back. Once with the Widescreen and once with the Pan and Scan settings. THE DVD HAS BOTH. I understand Milla's commentary is funny. I haven't heard it yet. Her commentary on the first RE was hilarious.

As Shawn Edwards from FOX TV said, ""FANS OF THE GAME WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE."" It's like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Nice. This has CULT CLASSIC written all over it.

IF YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND WHO LOVES SCARY MOVIES, SCREEN IT FOR HER. AT TIMES, THIS FLICK IS JUMP-OUT-OF-YOUR-SEAT SCARY. AND FUNNY.

L.J. the pimp, played by Mike Epps is too funny. While checking out some topless zombie hookers, L.J. crashes into a parked car. I would too.

Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.

Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.",1104278400,6,743,4.803149606299213

The movie starts right where the first one left off and you don't have to worry about them messing up any of the plot points because there is no plot to either movie. Instead of plot, you have Jovovich and a few other people running around shooting, stabbing, punching, exploding and basically killing every kind of zombie that happens to cross their path. It is nothing but non-stop action and explosions the perfect thing to watch if you are trying to fall asleep. The zombies spread their plague by biting their victims which makes you wonder why Jovovich and the other women in the movie run around in shorts and tank tops. You could ask, but remember there is no plot so just let it go. Unlike King Arthur, where I was told no one wants to watch a movie with ugly people in it, Resident Evil is filled with ugly people. Really ugly people. It tanked at the box office so therefore, the ugly people rule must be right.

2448941,1,B000BYRCR4,"What I mean by ""fart in the wind"" is that once it's out in the open, it goes away fast, but while it's in the vicinity it's seriously rank. I couldn't get over the fact that the first one was fairly good, and this one just let me down. The story can't decide whether it's going to follow the games' story lines or if it's going to go on it's own. It takes some characters from the games like Jill, Carlos, Sherry, and Nicolei, and makes every single one pointless. Even Alice, who was likable to a certain degree in the first one (at least you want her character to live) but in this one she is just a [jerk]. You really didn't care what characters lived or died in this tradgedy that calls itself a film. Even Jovovich who is a decent actress did a poor job, and don't even get me started on the other actors. Especially the chick who played Jill. Just watch the way she holds her guns. She obviously had no training whatsoever. And Nemesis just look like a pile of poo rapped in armor. He looked so fake! And if you haven't played the games or read the books, you will have no idea whats going on. It never even explained what the S.T.A.R.S were, and therefor leaves all the non-gamers totally clueless.

If you actually liked this movie I recomend: House of the Dead, its a HORRIBLE zombie flick. The worst I have ever seen, actually worse than this one. And if you liked both movies, you have bad taste.

2448942,2,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins where the first film left off as Raccoon City has become a sweltering pot hole for T-virus infected zombies that seek human flesh to devour.  People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.

The struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.

The film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.",1104192000,,2279,4.857881136950905

I mean, come on...unless you've had your head in the sand, you oughta know Resident Evil: Apocalypse is nothing more than an action-horror popcorn flick based on the popular videogame. If THAT doesn't keep your expectations in check, then you must set yourself up for disappointment wayyyy too much in life. Anyway, I liked this sequel slightly more than the original, and I think it was because most of the action took place above ground...at times, I thought the original RE felt somewhat constricted, not fully capturing how large the underground facility really was. But this time, the effect is not just limited to (mostly) Umbrella employees in closed quarters, but the ""common folk"" of the entire Raccoon City perimeter as well, so you get a better perspective of just how out-of-hand things have gotten. The zombies, lickers, and devil dogs are back, and there's also a new troublemaker in town (the Nemesis). In addition to some of the characters, RE purists will recognize some locations and/or screen shots that pay homage to the game. Bottom line: good mindless fun, and a couple of sexy [...]-kicking heroines (Milla Jovovich & Sienna Guillory) never hurt either...there's always a time & place for movies like this. (FYI: The extra features are enormous & also worth checking out, my favorite being the commentary featuring a HILARIOUS Milla...BTW, even SHE knows it ain't Shakespeare) 3-3.5 stars.",1104192000,2,1544,5.082677165354331
2448945,3,B000BYRCR4,"Wow!  This is one case where I definitely wish that Amazon gave reviewers the option of rating both the film itself and the extras.

This is because while ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is just a slightly above average sequel, the extras on this DVD offer hours of entertainment and are worthy of four stars on their own and maybe even five.

Let's start with the movie and some background on its history.

First, with the possible exception of snuff films, there is no film genre that commands less respect than that of the video-game based-movie.

It's not without good reason either. If you think of the video game based movies you've seen, odds are they all s@#$ed majorly. ""Super Mario Brothers""? Awful. Van Damme's ""Streetfighter""? Mediocre at best. ""House of the Dead""? Dumb.

Which is why when ""Resident Evil"" appeared in theaters in 2002 it was something of a small miracle. Not only was the film not bad it was actually very good. Smart, sexy, stylish, ""Resident Evil"" was the rare video game film that transcended its roots to become a highly enjoyable movie-going experience for both diehard gamers and regular viewers.

It also helped to revitalize the zombie movie genre, kicking off a resurgence of zombie and zombie-esqe films that began with ""28 Days Later,"" the new ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and the Brit comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""

That trend continues now with ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"" which picks up right where the first film ended.

The bad news? RE2 is not as good as it's predecessor. The good news? It's still pretty good.

Returning for this installment is Milla Jovovich as Alice, sole survivor of the first film's series of events. Also, along for the ride is the luscious Sienna Guillory as S.T.A.R.S. officer, Jill Valentine, a name that will be familiar to fans of the ""Resident Evil"" video games. It's worth noting also that Guillory's resemblance to her videogame counterpart is so striking it's almost scary.

Other game characters also make their appearances here although some fans may be dissappointed that they are not featured as prominently.

Part of what made the first film work so well was the sure and inventive direction of Paul W.S. Anderson(""Mortal Kombat"", ""Aliens Vs. Predator""). Anderson's obvious love of video games seems to result in better than average film adaptations of them when he directs.

Anderson didn't helm this installment but new director Alexander Witt still manages to pull of some solid and occasionally stunning action sequences in this film. The church standoff, involving Alice and a trio of Lickers is especially memorable. Ditto Alice's run down the side of a skyscraper near the film's climax.

I'm only giving this film three stars though because it's flaws keep it from rising to masterpiece or even superb levels. Those flaws include:

Poor attention to characters - Though ""Resident Evil"" also boasted an ensemble cast, the writing and direction there were sharp enough to ensure that certain characters emerged as standouts. This is not the case here, where the ensemble just isn't balanced properly. Even Jovovich and Guillory don't get enough screen time and they are supposed to be the stars.

Not enough zombies - For a film that is supposed to be, at it's core, a zombie film, this movie offers far too few shots of the undead. When we do seem them they are often shot in shadowed, blurred slow motion.

Mike Epps - Mike, I loved you in the ""Friday"" sequels but if you're not careful you're destined to wind up as the Trimspa version of fellow Black comedian-actor Anthony Anderson i.e. the go to guy when a movie requires an annoying Black comic sidekick. Note to Hollywood: If you want to include Black characters in mainstream films try to make sure that they're well-rounded and have depth instead of the same tired, loudmouthed stereotypes we've been seeing for generations.

At least the movie explains why slim-framed Alice is able to pull off increasingly amazing feats of strength. Seems her exposure to the T-Virus is slowly evolving her to the point where she manifests superhuman powers. Where this storyline will take us, I have no idea.

Now for the extras.  Simply put, this DVD offers an impressive array of special features that will keep viewers busy long into the night.  You get, three, count 'em three commentaries, 20 deleted scenes, a six-part making of feature, and host of other goodies that amount to everything AND the kitchen sink.

Most interesting is the feature on real-world corporate malfeasance.  Rarely does schlock entertainment actually try to make you think.

I also love the fact, that this DVD release contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The ongoing trend of many studios releasing two different formats on separate discs fails to acknowledge many fans do like to have both versions and can't afford to shell out for the same DVD twice in order to have them.

While this is a great package there's no getting around the fact that the movie its wrapping is just a bit above okay.  In the end, I feel that movies like ""28 Days Later"" and the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" have raised the bar for zombie and zombie-like movies.  Anything coming afterward has really gotta step up its game.  ""Resident Evil:Apocalyse"" just didn't quite meet that challenge.

One thing I can say is that this film left me curious to see what happens in ""Resident Evil 3."" And if Sienna Guillory comes back for that one, consider my advance ticket already bought.",1104192000,2,5484,4.8782327586206895

The acting was quite good, and so were visual effects.  I think that the movie lacked slightly in the story, and it wasn't as hard hitting as I expected, but it still was entertaining, made you think, and was never boring.  Excluding maybe 15 minutes in the middle, this is not as much as a horror movie as the first one.  This one has a lot more action, and a lot less tension, so if your looking for a horror movie to scare you, this would not be your best option.  If you enjoy martial arts, action, and all around coolness however, you will enjoy this movie.  Another great aspect to this movie was the soundtrack, it contained many adrenaline boosting songs, and really added to the movie.  If you are into action, rock music, big guns, an interesting story, and you don't mind violence/gore, then you will definately enjoy this movie.  A real must-see.",1104019200,4,1023,4.433155080213904

Appearance: Unlike the 1st one it has a colorless ""wrap"" on the outside the case. The ""wrap"" has digitally printed Alice's whole image as well as all the words on the back. looks very attractive to say the least. Other than 2 discs, inside the cover also is the advertisement paper of the up-coming RE4 game with free T-shirt given if purchased on their site.

Disc1:

Commentary no. 1 by director Alexander Witt, producer Jeremy Bolt, and executive producer Robert Kulzer

**I like this the best. Detailed comment on how they did a particular scene. Witt shows his humbleness and let Bolt and Kulzer do most of the talk. The favourite stuff is Kulzer described how they convinced Capcom's headquarter to let them make RE a movie. They also hinted RE3 is coming soon at the end. I like Bolt's one the best lol. I gave it an 10/10

Commentary no. 2 by Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, and Sienna Guillory

**Like the commentary on the 1st movie dvd, this is probably the most hilarious commantary in the history of dvd u will ever hear. Milla and Oded kept joking around so u will probably cant stop laugh til the end,whereas Sienna does her one separately(she talks ridiculously fast btw) which I'm a little disappointed by it. I gave it an 8/10

Commentary no. 3 by writer/producer Paul W.S. Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt

**This is also a very good one cuse it's done by the director of the lst movie. Paul explains how he created the storyline and why they changed them later on. They also mention Mortal Combat which they did almost 10 yrs ago. I like Bolt steps aside and let Paul does most of the talk as he already talked a lot on the other commentary lol. All in all very very enjoyable to listen to. I gave it an 9/10

Widescreen anamorphic and full-screen formats

**10/10 all the way. All dvds should include this option all the way.

Disc2:

20 deleted scenes

**most of them are not very long but still good

Cast outtakes

**some mistakes they made in the movie lol

2448949,5,B000BYRCR4,"I have been reading these reviews(mostly the 1 star reviews) and the thing i have noticed most is that people have this movie confused with a Zombie flick. It is not a ""Zombie"" movie and was not meant to compete with such films as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn"", ""Dead Alive"", etc, etc. It is a movie based on a video game that happened to have some of the enemies be zombies(just one of the many enemies in the game). I would have guessed that people would have been mad that Tyrant wasn't in the first film or that the ""Hunter"" has yet to be introduced.

I have also read that people are mad that the movie didn't follow the game. Well if the movie followed the game to a T, then it would be no fun to watch b/c you would know everything that would happen.

Think of this movie more as an action flick with a big budget, undead enemies, explosions, and one heck of a cool setting(Raccoon City). Overall this is a very enjoyable movie to watch. Don't get too technical on it and don't try to find faults or differences from the video game. If you do, you won't like it.
I rated this 5 stars b/c i am a huge fan of the video games and i think the directors for both movies did a wonderful job of capturing the ""Resident Evil"" vibe on the big screen. It's a lot to have on your plate to take one of the biggest selling video games and turn it into a movie.

So if you want to watch a great action flick, buy the Dvd. If you want to be a little whiny baby and pick apart the flaws, then right a 1 star review and go to your room to suck your thumb.",1103414400,3,1550,4.025974025974026

I wanted blood, but there was barely ANY, what were they thinking? Resident Evil is all about the blood 'n the zombies, which mind you, not EVEN ONE get's it's head blown off, which is how you kill them idiots! No wonder Alice's team suffered so much! The most redeeming, interesting part of the movie is the way it tries to give suspense and surprise, it fails on some levels to say the least but it is the best feature.

The way the movie ends is stupid too, it basically ENDS where it should've BEGUN, thus resulting to a tiresome sequel that may I say was a total flop!

2448964,5,B000BYRCR4,"I am an enormous Milla fan and I thought Resident Evil 2 was good. Although I do prefer the first film. The whole thing about accuracy compared to the actual video game is of little or no importance to me. I am more interested in the quality of the film judged on its own merit. If you like the game, action filled zombie movies or the divine Milla Jovovich, you should check out this DVD. But also take a look at part one, if you haven't already.",1101340800,,447,4.149425287356322
2448965,5,B000BYRCR4,"First off. To the person who did nothing but diss this movie, you obviously need to go find something to do. You wrote that review because you were disappointed that it wasn't as ""game-like"" as it should have been. Me, being one of the biggest fans of Resident Evil, think the same, but I loved the movie. Jill and Alice were both great, and it actually had a lot to do with the games. You see, if you were a real fan, you would know that. Obviously however, you are just a wanna-be. Do not listen to people like him.

  Second, for the actual review. Resident Evil Apocalypse was full of everything you would want in a horror/action/suspense/thriller movie. Lickers appear yet again in this movie, which I was quite glad to see. I want to see the Neptune shark(s) in a Resident Evil movie, though. The Nemesis looked great. Not exactly like the game, but close enough.

To sum it up, Alice starts off as she ended the first movie, alone. She gets geared up and finds out she was tested on, (Which is what created to her new super strength) She meets with Jill and the others, ends up on a mission to save Dr. Ashford's daughter (I did not see any relation to Alexia Ashford from RE Code: veronica, though.), which would lead to their evacuation of the city. They find her, and meet him. He gets shot, Alice fights Nemesis, who remembers her and joins her side (The only thing I did not exactly like...Nemesis was the big bad in RE3. But, due to the new story, I was able to deal with the new idea.) And they all fly off in a helicopter. (Not the Nemesis) The Helicopter crashes, and Alice appears to be burned to death. Hehe, if you haven't seen the rest of the movie, i'll let you see the rest for yourself.

  As for the boxed set perspective, I am extremely happy that they did this. My old copy of RE1, (The one I bought the day RE1 came out) Is pretty worn out. I watched it so many times, and brought it to so many places, that it is all messed up. So, I figure why not kill two birds with one stone. And to answer the ""Special Features"" question, I am sure they will have them.

  So, RE2 is definately a great movie. Some people may not like it, but that is because they really have no taste in movies. Both RE1 and RE2 are great movies. Definately buy this dvd boxed set.",1101168000,16,2281,4.247113163972286

2448971,4,B000BYRCR4,"I enjoyed the first resident evil film because of the action but where was the gore from the games. The zombies didn't seem that hungry to me. They were supposed to be ravanous flesh hungry zombies but that wasn't what you see. For instance take the bloke who gets pinned down in the lift. You see loads of zombies clawing at him but when he becomes a zombie later, he has some lacerations and a few chunks out of him. Does that seem like ravanous zombies to you? If that had been a george romero film, you can guarantee that there wouldn't have been anything left of him to get back up. Except maybe a skeleton. Where as Resident Evil Apocalypse was better than i thought it would be. The blood flowed much more in this film. The zombies took more detailed chunks out of their victims (if you were pinned down in this film, there would be nothing left of you as these zombies really are hungry. Check out the poor woman who gets it in the school. You don't see her again. Gee i wonder why?) and the lickers were better too and it was scary during parts too. The intro to jill was cool. You don't need an intro to her character in this film as you already know her from the games and the game that she used that dress in was Resident Evil Nemesis (which i believe this film was loosely based on)where she popped a zombie's head as soon as she saw it. Alice is better in this film as she can seriously kick ass. Both zombie and nemesis. The intro of the original s.t.a.r.r.s team was good, even though they didn't last very long. The ending was very good too as alice, the zombies and a special character turns against their creators at umbrella. About time they got what was coming to them. Look forward to R.E 3.

In my opinion, this movie should be considered a Action film not a horror film.  I wasn't scared one bit.  The action of this movie was great.  I watched the first movie a milion of times.  It is a hot movie with action.  Stop comparing the movie to the games, and just compare it to the movie itself.  It's really hard to make a movie 100% on a game.

2448986,3,B000BYRCR4,"The first 30 or so minutes of ""Resident Evil"" is everything you could really hope for in a horror movie: a clever, tightly-plotted, interesting story that keeps you on your toes and makes you wince a little -- in a delightful ""Oh man, I can't believe they went THERE"" sort of way -- every few minutes. The movie starts out fast and never really lets you get your footing, while it delivers punch after punch in a very effective progression. If only they could have kept it up the whole way through.

However, once the walking dead come out, everything goes downhill fast. And I don't mean in a good way.

The funny thing is, it shouldn't be like this. The majority of the concept of the video games that spawned the film ""Resident Evil"" is fighting zombies, and the games are fun to play. One would think that the film would manage to re-create this effect easily. It's the opposite that's true, however, as everything leading up to the appearance of the zombies is the best part of the film. Once the re-animated corpses actually start lurching out onto the main stage, it just gets sort of boring.

Mind you, ""Resident Evil"" did benefit from some rather good stuff. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez both add something unique to their roles. Butt-kicking women are something of a staple in video games and in action films these days, but these two make their characters into more than the stereotype, and they're fun to watch. Milla, in particular, has a truly unique quality about her which she brings to everything she plays, and its on display here too. The music played throughout the film sets the tone nicely. The little hints dropped throughout the movie for devotees of the game series (listen, for example, for a mention of ""Project Nemesis"") add a bit of fun to it.

But in the end, this could have been better any way you slice it. As a horror movie, it's not very scary. As an action movie, it's not that exciting. Judged against other, similar films (""28 Days Later"" for example), it comes in a bit lacking. Even when compared to its source, the video game by the same name, it doesn't quite measure up.

There are those who would say that movies based on video games are destined to failure, but I disagree. ""Resident Evil"" has the potential to make for a great film, even a great series of films. If you only look at the first 30 or so minutes of this movie, you can see where that potential lies. The fact that you can stop the movie once the first zombies stumble out of the shadows and not miss much of anything tells you where that potential fell short.",1099094400,,2578,4.511777301927195

Overall, I give this flick three stars and pray that the third, if there is one, is much better off.

this is sad because the beginning is good, i mean the 20 first minutes are good, all the panic and etc, i won'T spoil it.

There'S some good points of course, good special effects, the pumped soundtrack and two sexy female caracters. :-)!!!!

2448990,3,B000BYRCR4,"I am a Resident Evil fan of the GAMES and as such, I have come to expect a certain...depth to my RE experience.  In the game, Zombies are the result of science gone wrong and, as a survivor of science gone wrong, your on screen avatar is expected to get to the bottom of it all.  In the first movie Resident Evil, much of this tone came through wonderfully.  Although there was plenty of shooting and running, the characters had to use intelligence to defeat the Red Queen defense computer and the genetically enhanced licker.  Alice was just a normal, albiet well trained, woman who finds herself in a horrible situation.  Thats Resident Evil to the tee.  So one can imagine my suprise and dismay when Resident Evil Apocalypse had none of this...

RE 2 manages to take a basically puzzle based psychological theme and turns it into a totally mediocre action film with all the overly done cliches and pointlessly unrealistic sequences.  Alice is no longer well trained, she's a ""super being"" with ""amazing powers"" of various forms.  True, even in the games this is not untrod ground but in the games the ""SPB's"" or super powered beings were the bad guys, forcing the all to human heroes to overcome their amazing powers.  The David to Goliath theme is a time tested and wonderful one that fits Re like a glove.  Why the writers chose to leave it behind is beyond me.

In this movie, one will see way too many obvious deaths and plot twists.  There are at least 6 instances of characters firing at a zombie just behind a human for the ""oh wow you saved me while looking like you were going to kill me"" effect.  There are also humerous instances of the ""suprise attack"" by zombies that seem to leap out of the framework to fall upon unsuspecting characters.  Added to the mix came main characters with such amazing pistol skills that they can hit a zombie in the head every time.  Ever since Mission Impossible Two directors have thought this is something audiences want to see but I for one am getting VERY tired of it.

But the absolute worst thing about this movie is the irreverant use of the Resident Evil characters in the game without any thought to who or what they are.  It is painfully obvious that the director chose to use Jill Valentine from RE 1 and 3 the game because she is a woman and can ""sex the screen up.""  Her intro to the movie has her walking into a police station and shooting zombies in the head without any explination of how she knows to do this or why she seems to be in trouble.  Sure, there is a bit of allusion to her disgrace but no explination.  Well folks...here it is.  Jill was part of the elite STARS unit that responded to a dusturbance at the Umbrella mansion and were nearly wiped out by the unleashed zombies.  When they tried to return with their story, Umbrella supressed it and made sure the STARS were disbanded.  When Racoon City slides into anarchy, Nemesis is unleashed to remove the surviving STARS as witnesses to Umbrella's complicity.  Now why could't they have had a montage in the movie with all that!  I, for one, would have enjoyed it more than the questionable action scenes and thin plot.",1098403200,6,3145,4.502645502645502

2448992,5,B000BYRCR4,"I don't know where to begin with this movie.  First off, it was a movie based on one of my top favorite video game series of all time.  Second, it is the sequel to my second favorite movie of 2002.  Next up, it takes the story from Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, but improves upon it with better elements, action, music, and characters than the game version ever did.  RE3 was always average, good, but nothing spectacular, but this was such a better take on the story.  You have Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), the girl from the games, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), who is also from the third game, and Alice (Milla Jovovich), who was the star of the first movie.  All three of these characters were so much cooler than I ever imagined they would be, especially Jill.  This is probably one of the few movies where the co-star gets to do just as much as the main star to the movie, and I liked that.  I also found Carlos an improvement over the pompous playboy with the ""sexy accent"" that was in RE3.  The story was awesome, the music rocked, and most of all, it had many different elements from the game.

Those that complained how the first movie was not like the game should be happy with this one, or they will still complain because there were things taken out of the games.  You had a motor cycle homage to Devil May Cry, a homage to Grand Theft Auto, and a lot of references from the game.  A typewriter in the church, the Nemesis saying ""STARS,"" a little girl being related to an Umbrella scientist (and an Ashford no less), the opening to Code Veronica (one of the coolest RE openings too), and a few others I'll let everyone find for themselves.

The Nemesis looks just like he was taken out of the games, which is pretty cool, as does Jill.  Carlos' hair is not as long as it was in the games, but that is fine.  Alice looks pretty cool, and she is like a female version of Wesker from Code Veronica.  There is even a cool battle scene between Alice and the Nemesis.  The outcome is unexpected, but it is possible.  Of course, not all the characters are cool.  I was pretty disappointed with the way they treated Nicholai as he was nothing like he was in the games.

I just can not get enough of this movie, and I highly recommend it for everyone, especially those that love the games, even if you hated the first movie.  It does not mean you will like it, you may hate it, but at least give it a shot regardless, you might like it if you go in with an open mind.

As for, like the title says, I think it is the best movie of the year.

2449004,5,B000BYRCR4,"Blood flows and the Dead walk and chomp in Paul W.S. Anderson's charnel house of a videogame-to-movie zombie opus ""Resident Evil"", a hyper-kinetic, supremely stylish, super cool barrage of living Dead and corporate wickedness.

Instead of plowing its profits and R&D budget into detergents and oven cleaners, the nasty Umbrella Corporation has built itself a big bad virological bug. But as go the best laid plans of mice and men, the Big Bad Bug gets out into the uber-secret underground laboratory/think-tank/weapons factory that is the Hive, and the Hive's super-genius super-computer called the Red Queen gets all twitchy, snuffing all hands on board---with extreme prejudice.

The fun is just getting started. Cut to former shiny-happy Umbrella Corporation employee Alice (played tastily by actress-model-singer Milla Jovovich) waking up in the shower of a mansion with no memory as to how she got there. Not to worry, as she soon has plenty of company: a crack-squad of commandos sent in to do a by-the-numbers infiltration: get in, shut down the psychotic Red Queen, get out. Simplicity itself, right?

Dead wrong. Everybody in the Hive is dead---but they just don't seem to want to stay down. Slaughter, high-style, ample blood and goop, and a note-perfect Marilyn Manson score ensues, and our marines have to look sharp or find themselves turned into zombie chewtoys.

If you're looking for insanely high style, zombie chewing goodness, some nice scares, a good workout for your home entertainment system, model-actress-singer Milla Jovovich in a torn mini-skirt kicking wire-fu butt against undead Doberman pinschers, and all of this served up with a generous side-order of the Red Sauce---well, brothers and sisters, you've come to the right flick! Make sure the safety's off your 9mm Ruger, sling the double barreled shotgun at combat ready---that's you, Soldier!---and let's head deep into the zombie-haunted hallways of the Hive.

Zombie purists were concerned when original director, and zombie Grand-Master, George Romero turned the reins over to Paul Anderson, who had a choppy directorial resume: he had previously helmed the lackluster ""Soldier"" and the grisly if silly space-opera gruefest ""Event Horizon"". They need not have fretted; from the opening credits to the apocalytpic coda, Anderson proves a master stylist, working with cinematographer Dave Johnson (who worked with Anderson on ""Alien versus Predator"") to deliver ample zombie-chewing fun with a tight editing technique that serves up the carnage with a mix of brutality and flair.

The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James ""One"" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the digusting ""Licker"".

But look, the real delight here is the way Paul Anderson, cinematographer Johnson, and composer Marilyn Manson all work together to play out their gory magic on a palette of silence. Can you beat the scene where the Red Queen is first shut down, the blast doors all slide open, and there is that palpable hiss against the tomb-like quiet of the Hive---and then the groans of the shuffling, shambling, *very* hungry dead? Or when, after a second's reprieve, the survivors cower in a control room from an undead bio-engineered abomination, hungry to get in, pounding at a bulkhead blast-door? The movie is at its best when it is a series of gorgeous shifts from dead quiet to blood-thirsty crescendo.

The Hive and its environs are so brilliantly executed that Anderson effectively creates another character in the set-pieces alone, from the parquet and marble digs of the Mansion to the sleek, techno-sexy sterility of the Hive, to the goth-industrial Road-to-Nowhere that is the train---all of this adds to the horror and frame the desperation of our heroes as they war against the Living Dead (the train station and Hive Entrance being an actual underground system in Berlin!). Few films manage to bring everything together like ""Resident Evil"", and Anderson is to be commended in making it all work out in spades.

Finally, kudos to Anderson's team for mixing up effective CGI with animatronics: in the last few years, horror directors have taken the easy road with cheap computer-generated effects, and happily Anderson opts for tastily gory animatronic models that give beasties like the ""Licker"" the respect they deserve.

A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completists, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson.

The billion dollar question, of course, is---is ""Resident Evil"" scary? Imagine being locked up in the wilderland of the cubicle with flesh hungry co-workers, armed only with your wits and a 9mm automatic. You tell me, Soldier---you tell me.",1097539200,10,5782,5.186495176848875

I am really glad that they turned it into more of a political and psychological thriller instead of just us having to watch Alice and Co. run around killing mindless zombies.  I really liked the underlying political statements that were made concerning corporations and media control.  This flick is great for those seeking a slightly more ""intellectual"" movie, and for those who simply want to sit back in their stadium seats with some buttered popcorn and have a good time.

In any event, aside from the quote on quote Professional Gamers poor comments about the movie, I, quite frankly was thrilled. This movie supercedes the first, which most sequels fail to do. The explosions, guns, nemesis, alice, etc... are just awesome. It doesn't follow the exact story line of the game, however the first one didn't either. Regardless of these facts, those Professional Gamers that are talking trash about RE:2 remind me of the comic book collector off of The Simpsons... Not to bash or anything ;) However it is definitely worth the money to see it in theatres... so what are you waiting for?!?!? See the darn thing!",1097193600,,731,4.809523809523809
2449008,5,B000BYRCR4,"Well I have to disagree with most of the reviews here.  Usually the first film is the best and the sequel is not so good, but in my opinion Apocalyse surpassed the original film.  Milla Jovovich was brilliant.  I especially like the scene early on in the film where she crashed through the window of the church on a motorcycle ready to do battle with the creatures.  I felt it brought the game to life, and so what if it didn't exactly follow the story line and characters of the game - films based on novels rarely follow the exact story line of the original book, so why should one expect a film to exactly follow story line of a game.

I would definately recommend this film and I can't wait for the DVD to be released and will be adding it to my collection.

2449011,4,B000BYRCR4,"After eagerly awaiting for the sequel due to the open ending of RESIDENT EVIL, and being teased by realistic ""ad"" trailers I was ready to see Apocalypse.

This movie did not disappoint, in fact I may boldly state it is the best action/horror movie I have yet watched. Mila Jovanavich is again compelling to watch in the lead role as the sole survivor from the first movie. (Well technically she isn't the SOLE survivor, but don't want to provide more spoiler than neccessary to whet Amazonians appetite.

She had already been through hell surviving the HIVE, the awakens to discover the whole of Raccoon City fallen prey to the virus. Quickly she joins a small, determined group of humans who make a deal with an Umbrella scientist to be able to leave the quarantined city in return for rescuing his daughter.

The action in this movie is intense, yet being a Resident Evil movie there are some genuinely creepy scenes as well. Although APOCALYPSE is heavy on action and special effects there are characters here as well including Jill Valentine from the video game.

In fact I barely played Resident Evil so my memory was foggy, but friends confirmed that as the little I remembered led me to suspect this movie stayed really true to the game. One criticism I have heard is that it lacks the story that the first had, to which I reply hey it's a video game adaptation movie not Shakespeare. In other words this movie delivered exactly what I expected and much more, the fact that it was filmed obviously in Toronto, where I grew up was just that much more of a bonus.",1096934400,11,1568,4.60931899641577

I say this because I don't remember hearing or knowing that the main character's name was Alice until the end credits.

By the way in response to  Mr. Robbin's review, he said:

  ""Except for one part, Milla, your no Jackie Chan, so that kick move off the wall, w/o the explanation presented in the second movie, was just uncalled for; a little too over the top.""

2449013,2,B000BYRCR4,"Hollywood's latest contestant in the video-game-cum-feature-film sweepstakes rears its head in the form of Screen Gems Resident Evil.  Originally Evil was in the hands of zombie guru George A. Romero but ultimately it was not to be, and his latest foray into the zombie arena was momentarily halted.  Currently Romero is in pre-production on the 4th installment of his popular `Dead' series. That aside Resident Evil liberally culls its plot and look from the popular PlayStation discs, classic zombie flicks and Alien-type sci-fi.  But alas Anderson's Evil disappointingly brings very little to the horror fans table.

Is the film all bad? Well, no. On the contrary, the cybernetic sets are slick and well conceived, as are the gored-up, out of control zombie dogs. The script is a notch above par and the soundtrack features music by Crystal Method, Static X, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. However strong these attributes are they hardly rescue this release from being more run of the mill, teenage drekk.

Fans of Lucio Fulci and/or George Romero's zombie epics will find little redeeming in this sanitary picture. It's appalling that Hollywood can screw up such a simple formula. There's no need for convoluted plots or deep subtext. Merely start with some dead bodies and a gung-ho group of survivalists fused with radiation or good old-fashioned voodoo and you've got yerself the makins' for a zombie marathon. Oh, and you can't forget the blood, lots of blood.

Resident Evil was rated R for ""Strong Sci-Fi / Horror Violence, Language, Brief Sexuality / Nudity."" Taking the latter first, there was only one fleeting glimpse of a female nipple and some sex-under-the-sheets-in-a-flashback-with-a-strobe-light type of crap. Next up is ""Language."" I recall but one ""F"" word and I'm quite sure that many a youngster has spewed-forth much worse while blasting the contaminated undead in the comforts of their parents' homes. Finally the ""Strong Violence"" - the handling of this aspect distressed me as I soon found that these zombies hardly bled at all. Yep, a near blood-free zombie pic. In the film's defense they did attempt to explain this by saying, ""the blood coagulates only after the body is dead."" Fine. So now we should see blood clots and splats rather than streams and pools, but we don't. What we see is a whole lot of nothing.

Furthermore, the fast action scenes (i.e. minions of zombies being massacred by 3 people) are obscenely influenced by the stylistic renderings of the MTV age. Any gore that may have been present in these sequences is completely blanketed in an overkill of rapid-fire filmmaking tricks and stunts. So while it may come as a surprise to all 4 (count `em!) of the producers, the jittery camera pans, quick editing, flickering lights and extreme close-ups just make for one unpleasant mess.

It's a sad fact that the video game is more compelling, more fun and a helluva lot bloodier than its cinematic offshoot.

Note: The film's star Milla Jovovich may have experienced some dj vu as she awakens towards the end near naked on a lab table, just as she was at the start of The Fifth Element. Bruce Willis co-starred in The Fifth Element and awoke to a similar predicament in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. All roads seem to lead back to Bruce Willis. I don't like that.

2449014,1,B000BYRCR4,"Coming off the turkey that was ""Alien Vs. Predator"", Paul W.S. Anderson swings and misses again with another script full of awful dialouge and cardboard characters. Anderson hands over the directing honors to Alexander Witt on this one but it doesn't make too much of a difference. Witt soaks the film in stylized violence and over-produced CGI but unfortunately, such items as ""substance"" and ""content"" were thrown on the back-burner, this time around.

Starting where the original ""Resident"" left off, ""Apocalypse"" has Milla Jovovich's Alice trapped in a zombie plague that has engulfed the fictional Racoon City. Along the way she meets up with female rogue cop Jill Valentine, her partner, and a news reporter. Of course, a representitive of the evil Umbrella Corp. is behind it all. To make matters worse, he throws a genetically-enchanced creature called ""Nemesis"" into the mix. If the cartoonish super-villian subplot about a corporate honcho who fiendishly sacrifices innocent people for the sake of a major advancement in weaponry has ever see more played out and cheesy than it is here, I have yet to see it.

While ""Apocalypse"" plays out like a mix of ""Charlie's Angels"" and the ""Dawn Of The Dead"" remake, it certainly doesn't stop there. It kindly borrows its plot twists and even lifts dialouge from other films as well. While the original film was a promising video game adaption, this sequel is a series of pretty pictures wrapped up in a meaningless story. For all of its influences, you'd think at the very least that ""Apocalypse"" would make for a decent homage. Sadly, that isn't the case. The treatment of the zombie mytholgy is flimsy and the story feels like it would be better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon series adaption of the movie then a sequel. For all of its faults, if you're looking for a big mindless celebration of action and violence with cheesy dialouge and little of anything else, this could be your cup of tea.",1096675200,6,1956,4.906344410876133

If you liked the 1st Resident Evil, you will really enjoy this one. It has a lot more action and Milla Jovovich does a lot more fighting. You see, they did something to her, Alice. She hardly feels human anymore.

The really good thing about this movie is that it does not just focus on mindless zombies. In fact, after the first half of the movie, the zombies have a minimal role. The movie shifts its focus onto the Nemesis project, or Matt from the first movie. And the climatic fight between him and Alice was really cool with Toronto's old city hall as the backdrop. Torontonians will recognize familiar locations throughout the movie and you can even catch a glimpse of the CN Tower if you look closely.

On the downside, the movie does little to explain a lot of things that happen and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks. For instance, we never know why Alice comes crashing through the stained glass window or how she knows what is on the other side. If the Nemesis creature could be mind controlled, then why wasn't Alice. And why were zombies coming out of the ground in the graveyard.

Overall, this is an awesome movie. Great action and great fighting. And an interesting ending that plants the seed for a 3rd movie... I'm thinking about seeing this one again!",1096243200,12,1398,4.496062992125984

Not only for the fact that it is spawned from such a great game series, but also for the acting and the realism it contains. Not many people would agree with me when I say this is a good movie, but different people have different tastes, I guess.

Resident Evil takes place before the events of Resident Evil the game, and explains why the game's mansion is infested with zombies. The story follows Alice (Milla Jovovich), who is a woman that has forgotten her past and must travel with an Umbrella S.W.A.T team to discover who she is. Her path crosses with Matt (Eric Mabius) who is a delegate for a faction that opposes Umbrella, going under cover to discover what is really going on in The Hive.

2449033,4,B000BYRCR4,"So yeah, this movie basically has very little to do with the Resident Evil game series we all know and love. Granted, there are zombies. Lots of zombies. And zombie dogs. And there is *a* licker. No tyrants. Boo. But, we can't have everything jammed into one movie, can we?

Basic plot is that the Umbrella underground lab known as ""The Hive"" has had an outbreak of the T-virus, and everyone was killed. Milla Jovovich 's character awakes with no memory of what has happened, and is forced by Umbrella-sent commandos into the Hive to see what went on down there. Chaos ensues.

Milla did a decent bit of acting in this movie. Granted, the outfit was an obvious ploy to get fanboy response, but oh well. Eric Mabius did an excellent job as supporting lead, especially towards the end. (god bless those candid muscle shots) Michelle Rodriguez was also very believable in her performance.

So, if you've got a free afternoon and need some decent entertainment in terms of action, suspense, and zombie-popping fun, go for this flick. It's not like the games, but I guess we'll have to gag and bind Paul Anderson for him to do a *real* Resident Evil film.",1096070400,2,1150,4.627450980392157
2449034,3,B000BYRCR4,"Ok, I'll admit. I am a rabid fan of the resident evil series. I was  thrilled when the first movie came out, and was decently entertained by the first film. So, of course when I heard there was to be a sequel based on RE3, I was equally thrilled.

Err....then I watched it.

First off, there is way too much Milla. Granted, she was a good character for the first movie, because that movie was based on nothing in the games, and thus was believable to a point. But now, she's gone all Wesker on us, and is the superwoman of the movie. Please, please Mr. Anderson...stop giving the fanboys shots of Milla's miniscule chest, and give us the actual *game* characters in lead roles.

I did enjoy some parts. Nemesis was well put together, and rather authentic to the games. Probably the most authentic character of the movie, yet we don't see enough of him. D'oh. Carlos is, well, Carlos. Jill is not nearly the repectable S.T.A.R.S ass-kicker we all know and love, unfortunately. Nickolai is good now, and actually played well. (yay for Zach Ward!) Then there's alot of random plot-filling characters that are there as nothing more than zombie-fodder. That too...not enough zombie action. Sure, we see hordes of them in many shots of the city. But that's all there is, walking hordes. Not alot of the random jump-outs that are classic to the games. And, don't get me started on the Ashfords.

So, all-in-all, this was a good idea gone down the crapper. Some parts were decently done, but the majority was pasted together too sloppy. I guess Paul Anderson was too busy screwing with AvP to give this movie it's due credit.",1096070400,,1617,4.620209059233449
2449035,2,B000BYRCR4,"Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:

What a LOAD!

Tell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.

I swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.

Y'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.

The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.

It is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the ""R"" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.

All the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of ""Aw, man, I really liked him/her too"".

Now, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.

The zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say ""Oh yeah, they're here too"". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, ""Holy crap, they're screwed"".

Not necessarily so, Lois.

Instead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).

Naturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our ""Zombie Reminders"" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.

Okay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.

Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.

All of this combined makes me want to see the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.

I have noticed that this movie had some similarities with the RE game series, u get a couple of scenes from RE2, Nemesis & some characters from RE3 & another scene from Code Veronica. While many people have complained on how horrible this film is.. i want to say first off many flaws in other zombie/horror films..

in Dawn of the Dead (original) it doenst get quite into the action right away, but then it was an older movie.. thats probably why it was remade..

the problems in the remake of Dawn of the Dead.. you got too many stupid people in the movie which i see this in every horror film.. & the fact it doenst really stick to the plot.. to me.. there wasn't enough zombies in the mall.

problems in Night of the living dead (possibly both original & remake) you end up seeing fights between people instaed of them fighting zombies.. what is the deal with that??

..i could go on but you kinda catch my drift, people disregard this film to quickly, why?? Some RE game fans end up taking the plot too seriously & thinking 'oh i hate that, it shouldnt have been like that, lickers wernt in RE3'.. do people really know what they mean by 'BASED OFF A GAME'.. this movie is based off the game into it's own series.. rather then complaining on how characters & the storyline has been changed, it should be looked at for what its worth.

However, Apocalypse delivers where the original did not. It has all the action of RE games, as well as some memorable characters from RE3. More importantly, you get to see Raccoon City in all its glory. There were two parts of the movie that bugged me, though. The first was a horrible line of dialogue from Jill Valentine: ""I'm good... but I'm not that good"", refering to Alice's fighting abilities. The combination of sub-par acting on Jill's (I'm not sure who the actress is) behalf and poor writing on Anderson's made it utterly corny, and I felt it took away from the movie. Another low point is a really bad fake accent by Nicolai. He hadn't even enough lines to deserve an accent, so it escapes me why they let the actor (who I didn't buy in the role after seeing him in Titus, anyway) use one so awful it feels like he's really just joking around. Those aside, I still really enjoyed this movie, and if you are a fan of the genre and are willing to set aside realism for the sake of entertainment, I would definately suggest for you this movie.",1095638400,2,1178,4.359090909090909

THE PROBLEM, The problem with Resident Evil Apocalypse is that the camera views are awful. When you watch a fight seen you want to see the fight at a good angle and on many different angles. The views were so bad it's almost hard to describe them  but think about seeing a fight seen and the whole time the camera's focused on the person's chest the entire fight there's kicking and punching but you can't see much of the kicking or punching. SO GO See the movie if you love the game series or want to know the second part of the story, the movie won't let you down completely but those camera views are gonna start to get to you while watching.",1095638400,2,809,4.146496815286624

But this, this is a movie I'll be getting as soon as it comes out on dvd. This movie has TONS of action, and the zombies look real this time around. Remember how last time they looked kind of...stupid? Not here. The zombies look like they came from actual humans this time. The character's are pretty well developed, although sometimes Jill's toughness is kind of forced and she comes off as though she has no personality. She should've left the toughness to Milla Jovovich's character, Alice, since she kicked ten times more @$$, was tough, AND could cry at the end. There's almost no computer generation this time around, save for the lickers, which not even hours of worth of make up on an animal or human being could create. Speaking of lickers, this time the lickers(yes, there's more than one) are much more like themselves in the game. One even used it's tongue to kill someone! Yay! Anyways, now I move on...to the minuses. Dun dun DUN. Nemesis is probably the biggest weak point in the movie. While he resembles the Nemesis from RE3, near the end he begins acting a little...well...like a good guy. And although Nemesis looks real, in that same aspect he looks, well, silly. Also, the ending is kind of stupid. However, I'm not going to give it away to those of you who plan to see it. Even if you weren't interested in the RE films, Jill's hotness and Milla Jovovich's awesome frontal at the end make it worth seeing.",1095638400,,1541,4.607272727272727

2449045,3,B000BYRCR4,"**Warning: Minor spoilers ahead**

Honestly.  What can I say about this movie?  If you've seen the trailers for Resident Evil: Apocalypse, or have seen the first Resident Evil movie, then you know what kind of movie you're in for.  Anyone expecting a deep storyline (although I think most movie goers are smart enough not to expect one) would be advised to look elsewhere.  Apocalypse is a B-movie through and through.  It's heavy on fight scenes with gun-fighting, explosions, blood splattering, and limbs being broken every minute, with plot and dialogue taking a back seat.

Apocalypse's story is pretty standard fare.  It takes place soon after the events of the first Resident Evil movie.  A virus has spread through Raccoon City, turning its inhabitants into flesh eating zombies.  Those who have not yet been infected (i.e. the main characters in the movie) have to find a way out of the city while surviving the onrush of a zombie horde, and a super-zombie called the Nemesis.  In most B-level zombie movies you wouldn't expect the acting to be all that great...and this movie is no exception.  I don't blame the actors however.  Milla Jovovich (who plays Alice) and the rest of the cast try to make the best of the movie's stilted dialogue with varying degrees of success.

However, my main problem with the movie is that the plot is not much more than a string of `money shot' sequences that make no real sense.  One prime example of this is during the fight at the church.  Jovovich's character smashes through a stain glass window on a motorcycle and saves the lives of the humans inside.  A few problems with that whole sequence include: 1) How did she know what was going on inside the church?  2) How did she know exactly where to land?  3) Why didn't she just go through the front door?  Apocalypse is filled with many horror movie clichs (i.e. going into a dark room alone in a zombie infested building) where you know someone is going to die.  Also, there was one scene where Alice and the gang walk through a graveyard to try and escape the zombies.  Of all the places you could go to hide from the walking-dead, why in the world would you go into a graveyard?!  Now, you're probably asking why the heck I would expect a coherent story in a zombie movie?  Because it has been done before.  Movies like 28 Days Later have shown that zombie movies could have strong dialogue, character development, and a good plot.

The one bright spot in this movie is that if you want to see a ton of zombies get shot up, than Resident Evil: Apocalypse delivers in spades.  The action Apocalypse is non-stop, especially when the Nemesis shows up.  Speaking of the Nemesis, I can't help but like the design of Nemesis' costume, and seeing him blow up everything with his rocket launcher and chain gun was pretty darn cool.

The fact is, if you liked the first Resident Evil, than you will definitely like Apocalypse (and I should note that the ending leaves room for another sequel).  Personally, I thought that Apocalypse was actually better than the first movie, but frankly that's not saying much.  If you want to see a good zombie movie, I suggest you check out 28 Days Later, or Dawn of the Dead (either the 1978 or 2004 version which I have not yet seen, but I hear is quite good), and wait for Resident Evil: Apocalypse to come to DVD and rent it instead.

I give Resident Evil: Apocalypse a 6 out of 10.",1095465600,3,3413,4.580858085808581
2449046,4,B000BYRCR4,"I actually enjoyed movie.  It was a pure fun pop corn flick.  I was impressed how they summed up the first movie in a nice way that didn't take long and wasn't corny.  Jill was done extremely well, sense she is big shoes to fill.  Awesome fight scenes hands down, the only bad thing is the fact that some of the moves went by way too fast.  Such as the grave yard scene: even thought there was some awesome kicks, some of it went by way too fast.

The characters were pretty decent.  Jill, Alice, and Carlos kept their parts pretty good, and the new addition of Terri added some ""classic scared citizen"".  However, L.J. was put in there to add some humor to the movie like Rain did in the first, yet I feel added too much black man stereotypical humor.  And Nicholai was a flat out embarrassment to the original Resident Evil 3 game, I mean he was a good person, which kinda flattens any chance of him being cool.

There was some questionable scenes, such as when Terri was told to go to the second floor, why was she seen going down the stairs?  Or like when Alice was able to just look at the man through the camera and killed him, that was very corny, but then again, Alexia from the video game had similar powers, so I guess no need to be super shocked.  Also, the topless zombies, what a horrible way to add ""sex appeal"" to a movie, especially sense they really served no point in the movie.

But other than some minor flaws, it's a perfect Friday night flick if you're looking for a fun action horror movie.",1095465600,,1513,4.266666666666667

2449049,4,B000BYRCR4,"After seeing Apocalypse, the story picks up where it left off with Alice leaving Umbrella H.Q. and finds Raccoon City a trashed, urban ghost town! For those who expected the R.E. flicks to be 90% accurate, forgot they're loosely based on the videogames.

As Apocalypse begins, key players from the Umbrella Corp. are no longer a mystery behind their environmental suits as the T-virus spreads. The zombies are out on the loose, eating and infecting people as they go. The Umbrella Corp. enforces a quarantine lockdown when lovely (Sienna Guillory) Jill Valentine arrives. What was lacking from the sequel was the length of time Jill spent at the police station in light of that same scene from RE2 confronting the zombies and trying to figure out where they came from. Less suspense, gore, and blood didn't prevail after the sequel's predessor. But more zombies and more action earned my approval.

Milla Jovovich looks as tough as Xena: Princess Warrior with guns a blazing on a Harley. As for director Paul Anderson, he was supposed to direct this sequel but, fell back on his word and chose to do ""Aliens v.s Predator.""

The most shocking scene was our heroes in the graveyard and the dead reanimated by the T-virus coming out their burial lots in the shades of George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead."" Who was that man in the rubber ""Nemesis"" suit?

Yet Resident Evil has reinvented the zombie genre for a new audience of moviegoers. The purists can say whatever they want to say in retrospect of their zombie films of the 70's. Please remember we are in the year 2004, and today's zombie flicks contain some of our current event themes.",1095292800,,1644,4.778169014084507
2449050,3,B000BYRCR4,"I had very low expectations for this movie after watching the disaster that was the first Resident Evil movie.  The first Resident Evil movie failed on so many levels: as a horror movie, as an action movie, and most importantly as a decent movie.  A great deal of this failure was due to the poor director selection and the lousy script.  The director, Paul W.S. Anderson directed this movie in a manner that showed both a blatant disrespect for the source material and a poor understanding of the same source material.  As a result of the aforementioned things the original Resident Evil movie featured lousy camera work, the worst special effects since the Power Ranger television program, bad acting, an awful plot, and a painfully loud sound track.  The people who were probably the most disappointed with this mess of a film were the game fans who watched a ground breaking and frightening game series with an intriguing plot and great characters nearly have its movie life slaughtered on the first go round.

With that being said, a drastic improvement for the second Resident Evil movie was that Anderson decided to work on Alien vs. Predator (which by the way is a run-of-the-mill movie) and left the directing in the hands of a much more capable director Alexander Witt.  Instead of going for suspense and horror of the games Witt directed the film in a non-stop action manner.  This movie unlike the first movie also features characters from the game: Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera, Nicholai Sokolov, and the Nemesis B.O.W. (Bio Organic Weapon).  This time around there's also some comic relief provided by the funny Mike Epps and there are a few locations and scenes taken straight out of the game.  The inclusion of characters from the game, having a few locations from the game, and featuring some scenes out of various Resident Evil games may possibly appease some of the loyal game fans to some degree.

While this movie is so much better than the original movie it still has it share of problems.  The first and main problem with the movie is that Anderson is the screenwriter.  With that being the case the movie has no character development whatsoever.  This prevents the audience from truly caring about the characters.  Also Anderson's script centers around Alice (played by model Milla Jovovich) who by the way has nothing to do with the game and the plot of the movie doesn't follow the plot of Resident Evil 3 and the movie is supposed to be a movie version of that game.  The plot that Anderson creates for the movie is mediocre at best.

The special effects have improved a great deal over the first movie's laughable effects but they still are lacking.  The zombies do not look scary in the least bit.  This is really sad especially since there is a cemetery scene in the movie that features zombies coming out the grave who can't compete with the zombie make-up used in Lucio Fulci's 1980 film Zombi (alsos known as Zombi 2) that features some really nasty looking zombies coming out of a graveyard.  In fact the zombie make-up in Resident Evil can't compete with a lot of zombie flicks: Dawn of the Dead Remake, and Day of the Dead just to name a few. Even Michael Jackson's Thriller video features better zombie make-up than this movie.

There is also some inaccurate information provided by the movie.  Some of the inaccuracies include crediting Dr. Ashford as being the creator of the T-virus. Also in the movie the T-virus was supposedly created by Dr. Ashford to heal.  If you have ever played the game or like it as Anderson claims he does then he should have known that both of these things are complete nonsense and should never have been written in the script.  The S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team is also represented in a false manner in the movie again Anderson's poor understanding of the games and disrespect are shown by the way they are presented.

Oh, well I can only hope that if there's a third movie that the plot is related to that of Resident Evil:  Code Veronica since the series appears to be going in that direction and this would be the next logical step.  I pray that the studio executives wise up and loose Anderson from the production and replace him with a competent screenwriter and that the main focus of the story is no longer Alice.  I also hope that they include the characters of Albert Wesker, Chris Redfield, and Clare Redfield in the next movie.

Most importantly I hope that the Resident Evil production team for the games wises up and decides to work closely with the studio producing the Resident Evil movies much like Konami Corporation is working with the production team to produce a movie version of the incredible Silent Hill game.  If they had done this in the first place all of the millions of Resident Evil game fans who shelled out their hard earned cash to purchase game after game or the various other Resident Evil merchandise could've made the movie a mega blockbuster.  Not only that but it also would have helped to increase interest in the games by people whose only contact with Resident Evil was the movie.  It may have even generated renewed interest in Resident Evil with jaded fans.  All of these things together would have ultimately helped the game make more money.",1095292800,4,5281,4.7178649237472765
2449051,4,B000BYRCR4,"I didn't care for the first one. I thought it was too slow. This one however revived the series. As the rating board says on the movie, in fine print under the R rating ""Non stop violence and gore"" need I say more?
It was a very good movie. My only problem is I hate matrix type movies and James bond type of movies, meaning: Impossible feats that not only leave you saying ""yea right"" but also are so outrageous they are laughable at best. Ex: she runs down a building on a rope. I thought that was not only impossible, but way cheesy. Movies need to stay away from the Charlie's angels mentality! You begin to stop taking it seriously when you see too much of this. Another nit-pick I have is the fast camera battle sequences. ITS ANNOYING! we all know the scenes. Where the camera moves so fast all you here is grunts from the battle, and a snippet of gore. Hold the camera still you moron!

Only wish more producers would get a clue from Matrix and film sequels all at one time or back to back. Waiting 2 sometimes more years for a sequel really sucks in my opinion.

2449063,3,B000BYRCR4,"""Apocalypse"" picks up right where this first ""Resident Evil"" left off.  In fact, it backtracks a bit to explain how the ending of the first came about.  And then, we are off, as Alice (Jovovich) hooks up with some others (Guillory, Holt, Fehr) trapped in the city.  The city has been locked down because the virus from the first movie has gotten out of the Hive.  The group is offered assistance in getting out if they can find and rescue the daughter of an Umbrella Corp. employee.  Added incentive comes in the form of a nuclear cleansing of the city that is on its way.  Along the way, they will deal with zombies, more of the creatures from the first movie, and the Nemesis (a really big, ugly mutant with a creepy smile).

""Apocalypse"" falls short of the confined terror of the first film.  The underground nature of the original added to the rising tension, while here the players have the run of the city.  Plus, to some extent, there is not much new here.  The Nemesis is a creepy adversary, but he introduced fairly early on, and his eventual end is no surprise, given the events of the first film.  There is also another cliffhanger of sorts at the end to set up another sequel.

Chances are, if you liked the first film, you will like this one as well.  If you did not like the first one or avoided it completely, you would be better off looking elsewhere for entertainment.  What you think you will get out of this film is exactly what you will get.  I liked it, but only enough to recommend on DVD.",1095206400,,1511,4.384892086330935
2449064,5,B000BYRCR4,"Disregard Roger Ebert's negative review and see this sequel for your own judgement. (BTW wasn't it Ebert who back then wrote that turd of a film; Beyond the valley of the dolls?!?)

This movie outdoes the original and many others of it's ilk, in various ways. Alice is back and this time we actually get to see Jill ""Master of unlocking"" Valentine. the actress who portrays the videogame based character bears an amazing spitting image. but unfortunetly lacks a bit of depth during the movie. One of the biggest surprises is Mike Epps, who provided comedy relief and not to mention Nemesis; the ""Terminator' of the RE franchise,and a real BADASS at that.

The movie's premise heavily borrows from various sci-fi horror flicks;Dawn of the dead,Return of the living dead,Escape from New York and Blade. but that's not necessarly a bad thing, is it?

REA was definetly made for the fans of the games,as a few scenes were lifted straight from the previous RE videogames. I.E.

Alice drops her gun then lowers herself to catch it while being surrounded by umbrella soldiers, The missle launch while Racoon City's zombies are looking overhead to meet their maker, Nemesis utters; ""STAAAARRSSSS"" after mowing down the entire racoon city police department,etc. some may recognize Dr. Ashford's daughter as ""the Red Queen"" from the first movie although they didn't make it obvious enough.

  We leave off with Alice in the streets of raccoon City...which has been completely destroyed by zombies and the sort due to the Tvirus leaking. However, RE:A picks up a few hours before that happens. Umbrella. the evil corporation behind everything, goes to pick up its high-tech employees. one of which being Dr. Ashford. However, his daughter, also being transported to a safe place, her car gets hit by a truck and we see that she is barely alive. Now here is where things get bad.

  You remember the Hive right? that huge lab underneath Raccoon City? well the good people of Umbrella decided to re-open it thus they get attacked by the zombies in it and the virus spreads out into the city. NOW re go to the conclsion of the first movie. They show Alice wake up and go into the city. meanwhile. another person Jill Valentine, is also trying to escape the city and a few other people join in. some last a few minutes some last awhile until you know that they are bound to die.

  The movie itself features quite a few creatures. Of course, the zombies are back in and they look the same as the first movie but this time they move a little bit faster? also the zombie dogs are back and they actually put up a little bit more fight this time unlike the first movie where like 10 of them get killed with like a clip of bullets. Also, the lickers, yes i said lickerS, make an appearance. These look much better than the totally CGI one of the first movie. The fight scenes move fast but are done well. The character of Jill could have used a little bit more depth but its wasn't bad considering the director was making his debut.

  In closing, they basically have to find the girl cause Dr. Ashford said he could get them out. However, to complicate things, Umbrella decided to send in a little...re-inforcement"" in the form of NEMSIS, a huge walking tank almost complete with a rocket launcher and a helicpoter mini-gun capable of firing 6000 rounds a minute! and he's also immune to almost every type of ammo lol.

  The movie like i said is much better than the first. there's more action, more comedy lol although a little out of place sometimes, the acton is cool, and the movie is a managable Hour and 30min long. If i had to change anythig it would be:

  Perhaps the indepth of jill, the way NEMESIS is ""killed""

2449068,3,B000BYRCR4,"Back in the day before I became a fan of music and movies I was constantly in front of a TV playing a video game. Years have passed and my attention span for games has seems to grow thinner and thinner with time. It takes a really good game nowadays to hold my attention long enough to get through it. I never played the Resident Evil games back when they were in their prime (though I guess they never really died out). I came back and played both Resident Evil 2 and 3 much later on. I found myself strangely fascinated with both games and ended up beating them.

A lot of you might already know this but it wasn't until a little while later that I was informed that both games occur at the same time, hence the concept for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Be that as it may, both games have thier very own story lines. In Resident Evil 2 it is a split story between R.C.P.D. (Racoon City Police Department) officer Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield both trying to find their way out of the city. Claire is also on a mission to find her brother Chris (who made an appearance in the first Resident Evil game). Various other characters fall into their mismatched story that makes up Resident Evil 2. In Resident Evil 3 the lead role goes to Jill Valentine who, believe it or not, is trying to get out of Racoon City. Farfetched, I know. Through her journey she encounters a group of mercenaries led by Nikolai Ginovaef. The other two are Carlos Oliviera and Mikhail Victor. The catch with this game is it consist of frequent encounters from Nemesis, a beast of a monster set out to kill the S.T.A.R.S. members.

But this isn't a video game review, that was just some background info going into the movie. The movie's main character is Alice who is awakened on a lab table where she was put at the end of the first Resident Evil movie. Also struggling to get out of the city is Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera and a few other characters. After they all cross paths they are sent on a mission to find a scientist's daughter with the agreement he'll tell them how to get out of town if they find her. Also thrown into the mix to complicate things is the Nemesis and a few angry Umbrella Co. guys who are dead set on not letting anyone escape the city.

Where they decided to throw Alice into the mix I'm not sure, but it makes for a few good action sequences. Since the first movie, Alice has been given some type of chemicals that have now made her 'superhuman'. 'Superhuman' meaning she can do crazy things such as flips, jumps, run up walls, run at super speed and possess an unlimited amount of ammo.  So since she's with the team this means that they can bash as many zombies as they please and wipe the blood off and move to the next area where they, get this, kill more zombies.

There's nothing original about this flick and they could've done a much better job at combining the games together (since both had a very subtle story attatched). However, throughout some of the slop they've piled on they manage to work the obvious cliches we've grown to hate (going off into a room alone, monster behind the door or behind a character, etc.) they actually work them pretty well. The movie is a decent effort if you compare it on it's own merit (not along side the games) but becomes way too farfetched for it's own good before it's over.

If you know what you're getting (which is a done over zombie flick) and go in with low expectations then you just might enjoy it. If you expect not to be scared you might get a few jumps. A good one time through movie that unfortunately leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mouth before it's over, I give Resident Evil: Apocalypse a 6 out of 10 (or 3.5 stars).",1095033600,2,3694,4.346376811594203

Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, one of the two survivors of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), send to check something that went wrong in the hive hidden underneath Raccoon City, who is now trying to find a way to escape the city. Jovovich's performance is excellent, an improvement on her original performance for ""Resident Evil"" (2002). The cast is very promising. Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, a rogue member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), looking for a way to get out of the city, as well. Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera, one of three soldiers trapped in the city. Thomas Kretschmann as Major Cain, the commander of the command center in the safe zone and one of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. Sophie Vavasseur as Angie Ashford, daughter of Dr. Charles Ashford, a doctor whose research was used for biological weaponry, who is missing somewhere in the city. Razaaq Adoti as Peyton Wells, a friend of Jill's and a member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S). Jared Harris as Dr. Ashford, the doctor of whose research was used for biological weaponry and whose daughter is missing somewhere in the city. Mike Epps as L.J., a man whose in the right place at the wrong time. Sandrine Holt as Terri Morales, a reporter lost in the city looking for her big break. Matthew G. Taylor as Nemesis, the second survivor of Alice's elite group, whose real name is Matt Addison, who was transformed into Umbrella Corp's new creation. Zack Ward as Nicholai Sokolov, the second of the three soldiers trapped in the city and Olivera's right-hand man. Iain Glen as Dr. Isaacs, second of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. This is an excellent zombie pic in between ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (2004) & ""Resident Evil"" (2002). The directing by Alexander Witt (who was the cinematographer for ""Hollywood Homicide"" (2002), whose taking over for Paul W.S. Anderson, who produced and wrote the story and screenplay for this one, is excellent. The story and screenplay by Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote, produced, & directed the original ""Resident Evil"" (2002), and who also directed ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995), ""Event Horizon"" (1997) & ""Soldier"" (1998), who recently wrote and directed ""Alien Vs. Predator"" (2004) is excellent. The music by Jeff Danna (who also did the music to ""O"" (2001), with additional music by Elia Cmiral (who also did the music for ""Ronin"" (1998) & ""Stigmata"" (1999), ""Wrong Turn"" (2003), ""They"" (2002) ""Bones"" (2001) and also orchestrated the score to ""Bones"" (2001), is excellent. The cinematography by Derek Rogers & Christian Sebaldt is excellent. The film editing by Eddie Hamilton is excellent. Casting by Tina Gerussi (who did the casting for ""Chicago"" (2002), ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) ""Dracula 2000"" (2000) & Robyn Ray (who did the casting for the original ""Resident Evil"" (2002), ""She's All That"" (1999), ""Dracula 2000"" (2000), & ""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" (1993) is excellent. The production design by Paul D. Austerberry (who production designed ""Exit Wounds"" (2001), ""The Tuxedo"" (2002), recently, ""Highwaymen"" (2004) & upcoming, ""Assault On Precinct 13"" (2005) and was also the art director of ""X-Men"" (2000) & ""The Corruptor"" (1999) is excellent. The art direction by Nigel Churcher (who was the assistant art director for ""Frequency"" (2000), second assistant art director, graphics, for ""The Virgin Suicides"" (1999) & assistant art director for ""Bait"" (2000) & third assistant art director for ""Romeo & Juliet"" (1996) & also directed the art for ""Driven"" (2001), ""The Tuxedo"" (2002), recently, ""Highwaymen"" (2004) & upcoming, ""Assault On Precinct 13"" (2005) is excellent. The set decoration by Steven Essam (who set decorated ""Honey"" (2003), ""Paid In Full"" (2002) & the upcoming ""Assault On Precinct 13"" (2005) is excellent. The costume design by Mary E. McLeod (who costume designed ""Porky's"" (1982), ""Porky's II: The Next Day"" (1983), ""A Christmas Story"" (1983), ""3000 Miles To Graceland"" (2001) & ""Driven"" (2001) & Adam Smith, who did the costuming to Nemesis, is excellent. The make-up effects on Nemesis and the rest of the zombies are excellent. A good sequel to its original movie.",1094947200,2,4680,5.1430446194225725
2449083,1,B000BYRCR4,"At least, that's what he has implied by ruining both Resident Evil and Aliens vs. Preditor. Why oh why did Sony choose him over George Romero? He had a script ready to go, and then Anderson walked in and offered to do it for less money, and that was that. The same thing can be said about Aliens vs. Preditor. Dream projects like AVP and RE will never be safe so long as Paul Anderson is making movies.

If you want the real Resident Evil expirience, I suggest you play the remake of the first game on Gamecube. If you desire a non-interactive adaptation of the games, read the books. If you must see just how badly Anderson botched up the RE mythology, then by all means see the movies. But be forwarned, they suck. What could have been an excellent horror film adaptation of a classic game turned into a C grade action movie flop.",1094947200,3,832,4.333333333333333
2449084,5,B000BYRCR4,"As an avid player of the Resident Evil games, I put both the first film and this one to high standards.  Upon doing so, I was very impressed with the results of this sequel.  It has the best elements of the game mixed with just the right amount of originality, it picks up very smoothly from where the first left off, and the acting is exquisite.  My only dislike is the one part where the characters are walking through the cemetery and the dead come up from their graves.  Resident Evil for me has always been admirable because of its ability to take a very outlandish situation and give it scientific backing, and this part just took away from it... but who knows, maybe it was just some form of satire on Paul Anderson's part.  Other than this, the movie is exciting, easy to follow, and backed with plenty of explanation.  As for Nemesis, he was absolutely perfect, in appearance and action.  One friend of mine I went with had a complaint about the fact that the film does not corrolate with the game.  To this and those who agree, I say, if you want the storyline to be from the game verbatim, then play the damn game.",1094947200,2,1125,4.375
2449085,5,B000BYRCR4,"If you like action/horror films, find zombies terrifying (and therefore, excellent scary movie material), have a thing for Milla Jovovich, or most likely, have played and LOVED any of the many Resident Evil video games out there, then you need to check out this awesome film and its even better sequel. Personally, Milla is a bit too ""stereotype super model"" for my taste, but she's made some great movies, few things scare me more than Romero-stlye zombies, and  the Resident Evil games are the shiznight! Especially part 2, with the delectable Claire Redfield! Anywho, Resident Evil (the movie) is a sort of prequel to the video games, so don't worry if you're unfamiliar with them. The plot goes something like this: The Umbrella Corporation is the most powerful commercial entity in the world, producing a variety of cosmetic and other type products, but making their real money off illegal scientific research and development. Their most horrific new discovery is the T-virus, a chemical agent capable of causing monstrous mutations and even bringing the dead back to life! As if that didn't make it a scary enough place to work, their main center of operations is a huge, underground research facility called ""The Hive,"" located deep below the surface of Raccoon City. The only entrance to the facility is through the walls of a huge mansion on the outskirts of the city. The mansion is guarded by two security agents working for the company and under the guise of a newlywed couple. Everything is very well controlled and planned out, until the day the T-Virus is set loose!

Alice (Milla Jovovich), one of the security operatives guarding the mansion, wakes up to find herself naked and confused on the shower floor, with no memory of her life or identity. Suddenly, her home is stormed by a special ops team, and she and two mysterious men are taken prisoner. She soon is informed of who she is and who she works for, and that the strange circumstances are due to something gone wrong within the Hive. Using the secret entrance, the group travels via an underground train to the secret research facility, where they discover the worst has occurred. The T-Virus has escaped, the ""Red Queen, the computer entity that controls the security of the underground lair, has killed all employees to minimize risk of spreading the contamination, and all those dead employees are slowly waking up....and they are hungry! Suddenly, the race is on to get back to the train and out of the mansion before the secret blast doors close-up and seal their doom! But, before they can save themselves,  they'll have to face the wrath of the Red Queen, the terror of some monstrously mutated dogs, a horrific creature called ""The Licker,"" and an army of the living dead!

What makes ""Resident Evil"" such an excellent film is the style and attention with which it is executed. Even on a tight budget, the filmmakers, most of which were fans of the game themselves, went to great lengths to make this a movie worth watching again and again! The style of the game is ever present, from the extremely authentic scenes, creatures, and characters, to the brilliant sets, lighting, and camera angles. Homage is paid to great scifi/horror films of the past, as well as to ""Alice in Wonderland,"" seemingly a favorite book of filmmakers all over. The cast is excellently chosen for this type of movie, and I'm particularly impressed with their love of the games. Michelle Rodriguez is frightening, even when not a zombie, and Eric Mabius looks computer generated himself! And I don't mind adding that the producer's sister makes quite a lovely Dr./zombie in the film. And speaking of zombies, thanks so much for sticking with the game and not making those new, fast moving style zombies we see so much in current horror. Those are scary, but they're nowhere near as creepy. Conserving their energy for when you're within reach, these zombies are fast when they need to be, their deceptive slowness making them all the more frightening! The new ""Deluxe"" version of the DVD isn't overwhelmingly loaded with extras, after all, it's still only one disc, but it does include a fun cast and crew commentary that brings to mind a favorite line from Zoolander: ""A model, idiot."" It also includes theatrical trailers and featurettes, a clip from Resident Evil: Apocalypse, a visual effects commentary, an alternate ending that I'm sooo happy they didn't use (the ending they DID use is awesome), and filmographies. An incredibly cool, must own film for all fans of the video game and zombie genres! And the sequel is even better!",1094947200,4,4597,4.874680306905371
2449086,5,B000BYRCR4,"Ok first of all i saw both movies and they were both great. I have also played and have beaten all the resident evil games. The first movie was good and i see the point in what they were trying to do is make a whole new prelude story. thats ok, because it fit right in into the second movie ( based on the video games of resident evil 2 & 3).

I haven't seen a good action movie in a while, so this movie was a surprise. They did a great job with everything and the acting was good just like the first one. You need to have a balance in movies like that.

Maybe the only problem, if it's a problem at all, is that there is one guy that tries to be funny a couple of times, but you'll be able to over look it considering the rest of the movie is great.

Now for the video game comparisons. There is quite a bit of it, which they owe the game fans. It's not portrade as cheezy ether. Some of the characters die at points they weren't supose to, but that's ok, at least they had them in there. As for the ending, ""God! Now they set it up for a third one which is great, but if this film tanks there won't be one! So go see it so it does well! This film rocks and is not a disapointment!

I'm going to go again and bring as many friends as i can to see it!

P.S. people that only see the resident evil movies and don't play the games and then judge the movies poorly are referred to as ""fan boys"". Please stay away from them, and they deserve to be infected with the T-virus or the O-virus, and then have Nemesis fire rocket launcher missiles at them.",1094947200,2,1547,3.929712460063898
2449087,4,B000BYRCR4,"RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE begins almost immediately where RESIDENT EVIL ended. The movie gives us a few details surrounding the incidents from the first movie:  Umbrella people opening the Hive which unleashes the zombies infected with the T-virus, Umbrella rounding up their top scientists to evacuate from Raccoon City, what exactly happened to Alice and Matt Addison after they escaped the Hive, etc. Then the fun really begins. The movie jumps around quite a bit as it follows several different characters in several different places scattered throughout the city who don't start meeting up with each other until about half-way through the movie. Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera (heroes from the Resident Evil video games) have major roles in the film, teaming up with Alice and a few other stragglers as they attempt to escape the city before Umbrella nukes the place to kill off the T-virus before it spreads any further.

The movie has a lot of action and even though this is a zombie movie, it's bascically an action/espionage movie with a bunch of zombies running around instead of a simple horror movie. The licker from the first movie has a brief appearance (with some kin), as well as a couple of mutated dogs, and a creature called Nemesis.  The film isn't as gory as the first movie, though there is a lot of violence.  There are also a few unnecessary swears and a shot of a nude Alice in a laboratory.

I enjoyed RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE.  I've never played the video games, but I was surprised by the way the first film was done and I was excited to see this sequel.  In many ways, RE:A is a better film than RE.  My biggest complaint with the movie is that it sets up a third film which makes the movie ten minutes longer than it could have been. But then again, I'm excited to see the third installment and see how everything will come together in the end.",1094860800,4,1878,4.66969696969697
2449088,2,B000BYRCR4,"I've never claimed to be an expert on movie-making. Having said that, I think it's fair to say that a movie sequel should have at least *something* that distinguishes it from the first one. Something that spices up the overall story and yet maintains a continuity. Well, you won't see that with ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse."" Alexander Witt sat in the director's chair for this one, but he may as well change his name to Paul Anderson, because this movie is basically a recycled, watered-down pointless sequel to the first one. Witt brings absolutely nothing new to the table. This might as well just be an hour and a half long prologue to ""Resident Evil."" Judged on its own merits, this one sinks faster than a ball of lead thrown in a river.

To begin with, just about every cliche in the book is thrown into the mix, including the obligatory multi-racial cast, which of course wouldn't be complete without the loudmouth, wise-cracking nimrod whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. And poorly-timed comic relief, I might add. The script is so atrocious that one could probably follow the entire movie with zero dialogue spoken. And oh yeah, there are plenty of profanities just to make it more ""hip."" Action sequences are forced and cliched, and pretty much all of them are shown in the trailer. This movie has no flow whatsoever; it's one ""shoot 'em up"" scene after another. After the millionth zombie shot in the head it gets old real quick. The so-called ""scary"" scenes are more laughable than frightening. You can see them coming a million miles away. It's not a good sign when the audience is one step ahead of the movie. Many scenes were just flat-out sickening, such as the zombie corpse with worms crawling all over its face. Cheap shock value. And don't even get me started on the ""Nemesis"" monster. But hey, one good thing was that the guy inside that Halloween rubber suit could at least hide his face and not let anyone know he starred in this movie. I could go on but I think you get the point.

For me, the only enjoyable thing was seeing Milla Jovovich, whom I worship. She's perfect in her role as Alice. But as much as I love you Milla, even you couldn't save it.

Bottom line: ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is an overly-loud, pointless, cliched, virtually plotless, poorly directed carbon-copy of the first movie, and at least the first one had its moments. Now, I'm a movie-goer who's able to have realistic expectations when walking into the theater. The ""Resident Evil"" movies are based on a video game for teenagers, so I'm not expecting ""Citizen Kane."" But come on, there's nothing wrong with having at least SOME iota of intelligence in a movie of this genre. A total waste of time.",1094860800,2,2712,4.681341719077568

RE:A has again, showed the audience that the Resident Evil series has great potential on another media. RE:A, unlike the first film, describes in depth the sinister acts of the Umbrella Corporation, the larges commercial entity in the world. Alice, the main character, has survived but it changed because of T-virus cells implanted within her body. She is now the strongest warrior ever imagined. The film also succedes in linking the 3rd game with well known characters such as Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera. This movie is kickass, with women wearing short skirts, gigantic monsters with a handheld mini gun, and zombies galore.

You can go into this movie with preconceptions and you'll get just what you want or you can just go in like I did and enjoy it for what it is a popcorn escape and a fun ride!

I eagerly hope they make a 3rd because I think Milla Jovovich stands out as Alice I believe her and thought she did a good job at convincing me she was ALICE.

2449103,2,B000BYRCR4,"The sequel to 'Resident Evil' has more actions, to be sure, but the film itself is done with less creativity and originality, repeating what you have seen in other better films featuring the un-deads, or zombies.  (The timing of the release is worst for we have seen recently 'Dawn of the Dead.')  And as to the actions, some must be really good -- I say 'must' because many scenes are poorly directed and edited, with a camerawork that shows the director doens't know how to create exciting fighting sequences, whether they are martial arts or bullet shootings.

Sorry if I sound harsh, but don't say I am missing the point.  I know the film is based on a Capcom game, and I know the story is only an excuse for the heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich who returned from the original) who must fight against a lots of zombies, in Racoon City which always looks like Toronto.  I'm not complaining about it.

Anyway, the Umbrella Corp. very strong company cause the infection of deadly virus that spread all over the city (which has only one bridge to access there), and it should be contained immediately.  Many citizens are turned zombies, who attack the following hapless people -- Beside Alice, tough (suspended) cop Jill (Sienna Guillory, 'Love Actually'), soldier Carlos (Oded Fehr 'The Mummy'), small-time crook LJ (Mike Epps, 'Friday'), newsreporter Terri (Sandrine Holt).  Plus you see Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') who controls the military operation ruthlessly.

If you can ignore the numerous plot holes and inconsistent logics, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has serious problems with it.  As I said, the fighting sections, which should be the biggest feature of the film, suffer heavily from the inept editing that use too many fast cuts and slanted camera.  Milla Jovovich, physically fit, is fine as the fighting heroine, but the camera fails to capture the essence of her, which was so eloquently shown in 'The Fifth Element.'

To make matters worse, though Milla is as beautiful as ever, the film's confusing (and unfocused) plot somehow refuses to use her to the full.  In fact, you don't see Alice on screen for considerable time, as the film heavy-handedly introduces other characters into the story.  And the way it does is so confusing that you find the film repetitive -- see how many times you have to see some people biting others, which causes inevitable results.  Many have already seen the consequence in the original, so once is fine.  Twice is unnecessary.

There are good things, though.  Sienna Guillory is a standout as the strong-willed police officer, whose acting is perhaps better than the star Milla Jovovich.  Perhaps her roles was cut short (especially the earlier part) because some of her behaviors in the opening parts look too adrupt.  They should not have done that (if they did, I mean).  And Mike Epps gives us a few moments of genuine laughs, which are always welcome to me.

But as a whole 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a bit disappointment, because of its recycled ideas and mediocre actions.  What if Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote the script, but went to direct 'Alien vs Predator') directed this?  I don't know, but perhaps, just perhaps, made it more effective than Alexander Witt, who was the second director for pefectly choleographed 'Pirates of the Carribians.'",1094774400,,3357,4.942959001782532

i really love zombie movies, and was a huge fan of the first resident evil.  this one, i had such high hopes for.  the zombies are loose, the city is going to hell, and it should be a lot of fun and exciting and gory, right?

nope.

i won't give away a lot of details, but let's just say it felt completely thrown together, the editing was incredibly sloppy, the zombies were hardly scary and they spent too much time featuring the big monsters.

and can we talk about the use of the ""crappy strobe-y videocamera effect""?  seriously, i'm wondering if the person that invented that filter had stock in this film, as they used it ALL OVER THE PLACE, and it made the zombies look cheesier than the freaking THRILLER video.

I know fans won't be happy because it changes certain things from the game. Such as, The Biohazard Counter Measure Force. In the movie, they were there for a completely different reason than the game, and I don't think they were mercanaries.

I was hoping Nemesis would have a bigger part, but he was still good.

This Alexander Witt guy, who has done Second Unit Direction on lots of movies did a great job with this film.

Listen to me. A Resident Evil Fan for 8 years. I have never seen a better video game based movie. This is definately number two on my list of favorite movies. Just below Dawn of the Dead 2004.

You know what I find funny? People have been telling others that 28 Days Later is nothing more than a rip off of the Resident Evil games and movie, but they say, ""It's not a rip off of the game at all. It is an original idea."" But now, all the sudden the next Resident Evil movie comes out and people are now say that the movie is nothing more than a rip-off of 28 Days Later. Hello? Didn't you listen when everyone was telling you 28 Crappy Days Later was a rip-off of Resident Evil? To many idiots in the world.

Ebert goes off and gives the movie a bad review. Then he tells us that Jill drove the bike into the church. What a great critic. We know he's good. (Especially sence he obvioulsy wasn't paying attention). He also said that they were in the church fighting a whole bunch of zombies. When he said zombies, he meant those things crawling all over the walls.(obviously he wasn't paying attention). He also say there weren't a lot of those mutant things (lickers) in this one. He said the first Resident Evil had a lot....... Was he watching the movie? The first Resident Evil had one. This one had several(obviously he wasn't paying attention). Then he also said there were many tall mutants walking around(he's means Nemesis). Was he watching the movie? There was only one(obviously he wasn't paying attention). He also claims that the Nemesis was wearing body armor. He wasn't. He was wearing a leather coat. Obviously Ebert never played the game because he didn't know Nemesis could just regenerate after recieving a bullet. No matter where it hit. I think it's time Ebert stopped reviewing. He's just to old. He can't even watch movies anymore.

Paul Anderson has played the games, because recreates a lot of scenes from them and takes things from them,

---The scene where Alice is running down the hall while the helicopter shoots at her, then she is confronted by Umbrella men. She drops her gun, drops to the ground, catches the gun and shoots them. ""Resident Evil: Code Veronica"". Anybody remember that?

---Giving Alice superhuman abilities. Just like Wesker in ""Resident Evil: Code Veronica"".

---The bullet shot that goes into slow motion, then pretty much stops and goes behind the bullet. Then speeds up again. Anyone remember that from ""Resident Evil 0""?

---The where the zombies start eating somebody, then the angle pulls up into the air. Isn't that how they usually do the You Are Dead thing in all the ""Resident Evil"" games?

---The typewriter in the church. How do you save in the ""Resident Evil"" games?

---The part where Umbrella Inc. drops the weapons off for Nemesis. Similar to the scene where Umbrella dropped the capsule that contained T-002 into the police station. ""Resident Evil 2"".

---The scenes where the cops and Umbrella's men were shooting the zombies in the city. Pretty similar to the opening scene of ""Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"". Don't you think?

So, yes this is a good movie, but it is meant for teens and men 20-45, not women like this idiot named Claudia Puig.

I'v just found another critic named Roger Moore. Take a look at all the things he says were very dumb. ""What kind of nitwit screenwriter names his fictional movie town 'Raccoon City'?"" That's a qoute from his review. Are critics so pathetic during these days that they can't even do 1 minute of research on a game before they watch a movie based off of it? I wonder how many fans would have been pissed off if they changed the name of the city. Here's anothe quote, ""...one mother of a creature dressed in a leather kilt. Yeah, a kilt."" First of all, he should know that that is pretty much the same thing Nemesis wears in the game. Second of all, I don't think it's a kilt. He also takes the time to call the lickers, ""...gargoyle like supermonsters."" Critics today suck. Roger Moore can be reached at RMoore@orlandosentinal.com.

Critic Wesley Morris said, ""And judging from her(Jill) chest holster and that miniskirt-tank-top-knee-high-boots combo, I'd say somebody's been raiding Lara Croft's tomb."" I thought that little combo looked alot like the same clothes Jill wore in the game. That's just my opinion.

If a critic is going to review a movie based off a game, can't they atleast play the games for a minute? Or are they too self-obsessed to do that? Laying back in a pile of their own stupidity.

By the way. The Ashfords in the movie aren't meant to be the Ashfords from the game. Are people so lazy these days that they can't think for two seconds? Angie Ashford-Alexia Ashford. Did you see much resemblence?

You won't believe how many idiots I've heard that said they would not build a wall around the city and lock everyone in. Obviously they have never played the game. I believe it was ""Resident Evil 2"" that said they built a big wall around the city. That is where the idea came from in the movie. The difference is, in ""Resident Evil 2"", they let nobody out. If you were in the city when they built a wall around it, you were not getting out. Unless you worked for Umbrella, but your chances were still small.

How is this a racist movie? One guy was complaining that it was racist against black people because the black man does not kill many zombies, and only has a few lines. That tells me that a movie that is nothing but a black man standing on a stage telling a bunch of other black people that black men are perfect and every other race in the world is stupid is not racist, but a black not killing zombies and having a few funny lines is racist. I am Asian, but I lived in America my whole life. I do not have an accent. I do not look Asian, and I do not need some black guy telling me that when I get pulled over by the police, I pretend I do not know how to speak English. I speak one language, and have always spoken one language, and that is English. I do not need some black guy telling me what I do and do not do. He does not know me. If you think this movie is racist, then you need to get with the times, because everything is racist now, and nobody cares anymore.",1094774400,45,6720,4.473856209150327

This movie is right above the hive in Raccon city. The Lowes movie theater I went to see it had the volume cranked up real hide so that realy helped out in the jump out of my seat department. There was alot of scenes that made me jump in this movie. That's what I like about horror films and Zombie movies you never know when a Zombie is going to jump right out and attack. I'm glad Zombie movies have made a comeback! I'm so looking forward to seeing George A. Romero's Land of the Dead film. And that British comedy Shaun of The Dead. And cant wait to get Dawn of the Dead 2004 on DVD!Well any way if you like the first Resident Evil movie,then you should like Apocalypse. My one complaint about the movie the cool soundtrack from the first film is missing,not a Marylin Manson fan but his music for Resident Evil was very good,and it worked very well in the climax of the first movie.

I thought the first Resident Evil was okay, but Apocalypse is an even better action/horror film. This movie really flies by with an action scene occuring about every five minutes or so. This film is not brain candy, but eye candy like this is always a treat to me. The action scenes are well done even though the gore is tamed down a bit (don't worry there is still blood and tons of violence). Milla Jovovich returns and really plays Alice tough, yet sexy at the same time. Who would have thought a skinny model would make a great female action star? Sienna Guillory is even sexier in my opinion as Jill Valentine and I'll look forward to seeing more of her in the third RE film. Oded Fehr is a pretty good actor and will have you rooting for him and Mike Epps steals the show with some funny lines. I'd say almost everybody in the theater I saw it with seemed to say good things about it as they were walking out. I really didn't expect to like it that much, but I truly had a great time. I think it is just as good as the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead and the improved CGI over the crummier effects of the first film is a big plus as well.

2449116,3,B000BYRCR4,"""Resident Evil"" is actually a pretty cool movie.  I've never played the game(though I've been aware of it since it originally came out), so I don't have anything outside of the actual movie to base this review on.  I was expecting a mediocre action yarn about zombies run amok.  What I got was a lot better than expected.  Milla Jovovich is good as the brains/beauty heroine of this flick.  She's very believable.  Michelle Rodriguez is also good as the tough-as-nails soldier.  The rest of the cast does a very good job(including the walking dead).  The story is pretty good considering that it is based on a video game.  I'm assuming that the game is just as complex and confusing with its plot.

I spent the first minutes of the film confused about what was exactly going on, which probably happened to everyone who hasn't played the game.  Once the plot has been set, though, the movie is easy to follow and the action is very good.  The soundtrack is fitting for a movie like this.  It has a horror/techno vibe to it, not unlike ""Blade.""

As stated before, the action is very good.  It is paced just right and there are very few lulls in the action once the movie gets rolling.  The special effects are good, but are sort of awkward at times.  The mutated creature looked pretty fake due to some ""Mortal Kombat""-type CGI.  Both films shared the same director, so that doesn't surprise me.  This film is, however, superior to ""Mortal Kombat.""  One thing that impressed me the most about this film is that it had slick set design and good lighting.  Most films in this genre tend to darken things up a bit in an attempt to hide flaws in the special effects.  ""Resident Evil"" lets you view all of the action, even though some of it is looks a bit fake, in great lighting.  No squinting to do, which is a good thing.  That's one of the main reasons I let some of the CGI screw-ups slip by.

The horror aspect of this film was basically a lot of ""jump-at-you"" scares.  I enjoyed that, but I feel that this movie is better categorized as an action flick.

As far as the DVD goes, the special features were par for the course on this type of film.  Lots of ""making of"" segments, which were fun to watch, are included.  There's also a filmography of the main characters and the director.  The free ticket to ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" was also a nice touch, and I'll definitely go check it out.

Overall, a nice action flick that does good for the Milla Jovovich machine.  It's worthy of multiple viewings, but if you aren't into action/gore films, you may want to avoid this one.",1094688000,,2579,4.47741935483871
2449117,5,B000BYRCR4,"If you go to [...] for Resident Evil: Apocalypse you will see that the user reviews are alot more helpful and useful than the critics like ROBERT EBERT. There is a huge contrast for the ratings between the so called ""professional"" critics and the general users. There isn't even one decent movie critic review which gives the movie the proper credit it deserves. This movie wasn't SUPPOSED to be an oscar caliber drama and dialogue. It is based on a video game and novels which has a huge cult following. Name any other movie based on a video game which can even come close to the thrills RE has provided its fans: not tomb raider, not final fantasy, not house of the dead.
The opening weekend sends a verdict to he critics: you have poor credibility and lack objective juxtaposing ability.
Now I say what I thought about the movie. Resident Evil: Apocalypse has made some big changes ever since the first Resident Evil and trust me they are worth seeing. This movie is full of scary parts and humerous moments and great action sequences, that trust me you will never forget. I was a little dissapointed though on how this movie was not as scary and sinister as the first But many people jumped at many various parts of the movie including me. Alot people have been talking about the zombies lately. I would have to say they were not scary...they seemed to be alot weaker as if you could push them over. I took it as kind of a joke and sometimes it makes you wanna take pictures of the zombies then laugh ur arse off later on. But new creatures have emerged and are even more sinister like the ""Nemesis"" and the ""licker"".
Second the addition of ""Jill Valentine"" was simply very intelligent but you did not get to see her in full action. She was a little too much of the ""sidekick"" but you do see her kicking zombie [...]!!!
The visuals were amazing. The story was very good and you always wonder what will happen next. There is also the addition of new humerous moments that make you laugh by a new actor in the movie.

There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.

With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.  The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better.

It might of not of pleased all fans but it sure hooked me onto the Resident Evil franchise. I never played the games before seeing the movie and now I own all of them. With the success of the first one, the copyrights are now in full, and those die hard fans can stop complaining about the lack of relevance to the videogame series.

2449134,4,B000BYRCR4,"I have been playing the game since I was eight years old, and I hoped they would make it into a movie quickly. When they did, I had to see it the very day it premiered. Back then, I thought it was the greatest zombie movie ever made.(Dawn of the Dead 2004 stole that title)

It wasn't much like the video game, but it was good. I wasn't expecting it to be good. It was low budget, and the trailer was just an unorganized mess. But I was wrong. It was a great film, and had one of my favorite scenes in movie history. The laser scene.

I'm glad they fired that idiot Romero from this movie. I've read his script. You can tell that he's never played the game before they hired him to do the movie. He based his script off the first Resident Evil game, and he ruined it. Chris had eagle friends? Jill left for the mansion first? Rebecca was always with Chris? No!!! He ruined the whole thing, and his style of zombies is pathetic.

Paul Anderson did a great job with this movie. People call him a bad director. I've yet to see a movie he's done that was bad. Can somebody tell me what movie is so horrible that nobody likes him?

Although the zombies weren't fast, they did make fierce and vicious sounds. I liked that.

I liked this movie a lot. It's one of the first horror movies I've seen in awhile that actually left me a little jittery (followed by 28 Days Later which is a better movie). The dialogue wasn't spectacular, but the storyline and cinematics were excellent.
This is almost more an action flick than it is a horror movie, which is quite fine by me. The action sequences are excellent and well choreographed. The special effects were also good and believable.

I watched this movie, expecting it to be really unbelievable, because most zombie movies are (I find), but they were pretty believable, because they look just like normal humans, except for there eyes, and teeth(except a couple of their faces are mangled from dying).

The result is a mediocre horror flick, with a story not convincing enough and character development far from sophisticated enough for the movie to be even slightly memorable.

The atmosphere is clinical, very much reminiscent of Event Horizon, another movie made by the same director Paul Anderson, only that Event Horizon is a slightly more interesting movie. The movie's sterilized feel is almost devoid of human emotions, even in the one or two forced scenes where the characters are supposed to express sympathy and compassion. Those scenes are ineffective. It feels like the script writers feel compelled to include them only to make sure the audience can distinguish the otherwise cold and expressionless human characters from the zombies and artificial intelligence. The stubborn refusal to develop the characters in any three-dimensional sense is rather annoying.

Even if one treats it as a ride in an amusement park, the movie fails to really deliver. The zombie attacks are clichd, and you could feel that even the cast sometimes shows in the movie their own lack of interests. Humor, in any form, is also conspicuously missing in the movie.

The visual effects (for a non video-game fantatic like me) are well done, and there are some jump out of your seat moments.  Milla Jovovich, who was so good in FIFTH ELEMENT, has a rubber face that displays a wide range of emotions for a basically undeveloped character.  Michelle Rodriguez overdoes the tough girl part, but is effective nonetheless.  Eric Mabius gives Matt both a tough and sensitive edge, and redeems himself for BLACK CIRCLE BOYS.  Martin Crewes as Caplan is quite good, as is James Purefoy (A Knight's Tale) in the role of Jovovich's undercover lover.  The monster dogs, zombies, laser killer and chief monster are all well done, and the movie's apocalyptic ending certainly leaves room for the upcoming sequel.

Resident Evil: Based on the super popular video games of the same name.
Basic plot, OH Geeeze Meathead don't spoil it for the rest of us who might want to see it. Players of the Resident Evil series of video games will recognise many of the scenes and plot elements. I didn't becuase I haven't played the games except maybe the first or second one once or twice (whichever one starts outside the mansion). OK so without giving too much away, a deadly virus breaks out in a super secret experimental laboratory complex that is controled by a supercomputer Named ""The Red Queen"" that has gone out-of-control so the powers that be send in the marines so to speak (a special forces type paramilitary unit). Meanwhile the main character Alice played by Jovovich has amnesia, a side effect of nerve gas released by the Red Queen, and slowly regains her memory as events unfold. Yes there are intentional parralels to Louis Carols Alice In Wonderland. I enjoyed this movie although you do have to turn off your brain as with most other movies of this genre. An interesting bit of trivia is that Night of the Living Dead (1968) Director George A. Romero, was originally on board to write and direct, but left the project due to creative differences over the script. The sound is typical Sci-fi, Horror, suspense heavy metal type music scored by Marco Beltrami and get this Marilyn Manson. Oddly enough despite that bizarre match up the music works. As for the plot etc... The result is something like Demon Seed meets Night of The Living Dead, meets Lara Croft - Tomb Raider with a little Total Recall and Raiders of The Lost Ark thrown in. I liked one scene which according to Internet Movie Data Base was inspired by and is very similar to a scene in the Canadian movie The Cube. My entertainment dollar was well spent even with the slightly cheesy CGI effects and occasional cheap Zombie makeup mixed with just plain gory Zombie makeup. BTW they don't ever call the undead creatures Zombies, they usually refer to them as the monsters or creatures or things, wouldn't you?
The Quality is very good overall so out of 5 stars or discs or thumbs or whatever you wants. I give Resident Evil a 4 for the sound and the picture quality a 4.5",1089072000,,2367,4.598108747044917
2449170,5,B000BYRCR4,"First off, I have never played the game so I was able to watch the movie unbiased.  Which I guess worked to my favor since I absolutely love this movie.  I know people who played the game don't really care for it because it doesn't follow but I loved it.
I loved it because it is a good concept movie, which you don't get a whole lot these days.  My favorite person was Caplan.  I wish he made it to the end but you can't have everything right?
Anyway, the movie starts out in the Hive.  You get a look at someone throwing a vile in the lab and running.  You see three different settings going on.  The Red Queen notices the broken vile and takes action.  People are killed by drowning, falling in the elevator or by the halox (is the spelled right?).  Then cut to Alice, who is in the shower and apparently has fainted.
The movie is perfect, simply because a movie can't be perfect.  Your going to get some people saying the hated it and some people saying it was ok and some people loving it.  I think it is definately worth seeing for yourself and making up your own mind.
The last scene of the movie (I won't go into detail), I think is the best scene.  In one scene, Milla portrays just about every emotion there is in this one scene.  Scared, confused, disoriented, terrified, amazement, wonderment, lonliness, hurt, betrayal, strength and courage.
See the movie, if only one time and draw your own opinions.  Go in with an open mind and come out with your conclusion.",1088553600,,1474,4.351648351648351
2449171,3,B000BYRCR4,"This movie looks pretty interesting compared to the other Resident Evil. The only problem with the last movie, is that it couldn't reach its full potential since the budget was cut short. I will admit something, Paul Anderson is good at budgeting, but he is not that great at what he does. The problem with this upcoming movie, is that it is not following what the video game had. This movie needs to have a better story line that goes a long with the movie. One of the things that bugs me, is that Jill doesn't work along side of Alice. What I believe he should've done is made a diffrent story line, and put nemesis in it, but not jill, carlos, and nicolai. I believe if he would've stuck with a diffrent story line with diffrent people, and left nemesis in there, this would be a GREAT Movie! But see, the problem with the upcoming movie, is that first off, Nicolai is not the squad leader like he was in RE3. Why not? Why is Carlos the leader now? Also, the licker NEVER showed up in RE3, its debut was in RE2 and then they no longer were brought in. So why is the licker a main choice for this? Possibly if the budget is dephiseted? Well anyway, I will go see this movie, but I do not believe it to follow the video games like it should. But maybe Paul will make a movie revolving around Claire Redfield... That would truly be a masterpiece... But for now, we shall see what this movie shows.",1088294400,10,1397,4.2556390977443606
2449172,1,B000BYRCR4,"Oh man, I don't even know where to start with this review.
First of, I should say, that Resident Evil is another botched attempt by a movie company (Screen Gems) to bring
another game title to the bring screen.
All movies based on game titles have sucked :Final Fantasy,
Mortal Kombat are just 2 examples.  In fact, the same idiotic director who made those terrible  Mortal Kombat movies directed this piece of junk!!!
Once I knew that, I knew the movie was going to suck.
I just didn't how much it would suck, until I saw it.
After seeing it, I have to say that Capcom did  probably the most stupidest thing they could have done, by giving the rights for this movie to be made.
Furthermore, Capcom, obviously didn't care,  how the director was going to follow the game, because if they had, they would have seen that the film does  horrible injustice to the game.
It does not follow up the story and plot to the games.
In fact, none of the characters from the game:  Chris Redfield, Claire Redfill, Jill, or Leon, the policeman are in the film.
To understand why Resident Evil is a pitiful attempt
to bring the game to the screen, you have to know the
story in Resident Evil games.
An evil corporation called Umbrella, has unwilligenly
or willingly (depending on who you ask) has unleashed
a virus called the ""T virus"".  The T virus has the effect, of killing people and then  making them zombies.
Even more scary is the fact, that the Umbrella knows
about the situation but is covering it up. Only a  handful of corrupt politicians and Umbrella  personnel know about the virus.  In the first RE game, a team of special police  officers, trace the roots of the virus to a mansion,  harboring all sorts of monsters.  In fact, ""the scene of the mansion"" is in the movie,  but that's one of a few similiarities  between the game and the movie.  Eventually the last survivors of the mansion Chris  Redfield, Jill Valentine escape only to be separated . (...)
Birkin is himself infected, by a more powerful virus,
and is mutated to another horrible beast.  Eventually all the survivors escape, and thus  stop the Umbrella corporation from doing more damage  to Racoon City.
That's basically the Re games.  Sounds cool,doesn't it?
The Crappy, Sucky Movie version of Resident Evil
The movie starts out in the Umbrella Corporation.
Everthing is calm and cool, until an employee drops a
chemical container containing the T virus into the
floor.  Then all hell breaks loose, because it seems that
Umbrella's computer known as the Red Queen, has isolated and
captured all of Umbrella's employees and plans to kill them.
In fact, some of the death scene in Re are actually
pretty good, but most of them are not.  So eventually most of the people in Umbrella die, due  to this supercomputer. LOL.
This is garbage that is made up. In the Re games,
there is no ""Red Queen"" that is causing the killing in
Racoon City, and in Umbrella. The killing is brought
upon by the heads of Umbrella, and corrupt politicians, who have knowingly released the virus and are trying to cover
it up.  Instead, we get Milla Jolladovich, playing some drugged out,security officer named Alice Prospero.
Then comes the ridiculous plot of the movie, which is that
most of the damage inflicted on the personnel of Umbrella,
is by a computer called ""The Red Queen"" which
unleashes a set of death traps, to anyone infected with
the ""T virus"".
Practically the only part of the game that the movie
stays true to is in fact that Umbrella has created a virus called the ""T virus"" which it plans to use for germ warfare.
However, that's how close you'll come to similiarities once again between the game and the movie.
Eventually Ms. Prospero is rescued, (technically she
is put in the custody) of a group of special police cops ,
to infiltrate Umbrella and find out what the hell is going on.
Adding more confusion (and laughter) to the situation
is that Ms. Prospero has amnesia and doesn't  understand her connection to Umbrella.  Well it's revealed that Ms. Prospero was working with someone in Umbrella, to expose to the media the virus  that Umbrella was creating.
However, that person died, along with the evidence that
Umbrella is responsible for the chaos in Racoon City and
Umbrella.
Eventually these bumbling cops eventually meet a holographic
image of the Red Queen who says ""I've been a very bad girl"".
LOL. Yeah and I would have added ""I've been a bad actress
to be in this film too"".
Eventually the remaining cops become aware of the zombies and other monsters and try to escape from Umbrella headquarters....
Besides the terrible acting, script and story in Resident Evil, there is also a lack of creatures from the games.
The zombies , zombie dogs, and lickers are in R.E. but
here is a whole of creatures and monsters not in the movie:
Giant, poisonous spiders,  killer sharks, 2 arm ferocious hunters, large killer poisonous plants and the over 6ft tall indestructible Tyrants in the game. A waste of a golden opportunity to make a good movie.",1087430400,2,5017,4.668181818181818
2449173,4,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is a nitroglycerin packed horror film that is based on Capcom's best selling horror videogames with the same name.  Before the story begins the audience is introduced to the Umbrella Corporation that produces 90% of every home's household products.  However, its large profits are derived from military technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry, which is unknown to the public.  The story begins with Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up with temporary amnesia caused by gas released by the Hive's supercomputer, the Red Queen, as a defense mechanism.  The Hive is a secret underground research complex with an exterior design similar to the form of a virus, which hosts over 500 scientists.  Alice learns through a group of special operatives working for the Umbrella Corporation that she is also a special operative and something has gone wrong in the Hive.  The mission of the group is to find out what went wrong and turn off the Red Queen that has seemed to run amok.  As the group enters the darkened corridors of the Hive they enter a nightmare that submerges them into an agonizing reality of hellish creatures that want to nourish.  Resident Evil is a fast paced horror tale where the unknown is known, yet the moment of surprise will cause nerves to twitch involuntary as it offers a creepy cinematic experience.",1087344000,,1345,5.0
2449174,3,B000BYRCR4,"I'm a huge Resident Evil fan, and have trouble disliking anything related to the series (I even thought that RE survivor for PC was pretty good). This movie on the other hand was a let down for me. Gone is the creepy atmosphere, the feeling of suspence, and the over all fright factor the game created for so many. This has instead been replaced with a slick sci-fi-action movie with some sub-par acting and some reasonable special effects. The movie follows the game's story VERY loosly (there are still zombies, there are still guns, there are still STARS comandos, there is a high-tech lab, and they threw in the Licker monster from RE2....thats about it), which is one of the main reasons I was disapointed with this film. Many of the fans know and love the twisting, mysterious story of the orrigional game, and it has been replaced with a movie that is remanesent of Starship Troopers (not that this is particularly bad, but it is a huge change from the orrigional story). All-in-all, this was not a bad movie by any means, and is a fun action flick that you should at least rent, however, I believe RE fans will be some what disapointed. If you have no idea what Resident Evil is, or have never played any of the award winning games, you will probably enjoy the movie a lot more.",1086393600,,1286,4.523605150214593

  Everyone in the offices and laboratory of the Umbrella Corporation is gassed with a biohazard substance. Those that tried to escape in the elevator are killed.
  Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up naked in the shower. The room looks like a suite. She has no memory of how she got there. She is still under the side effects of the nerve gas. A red dress is laid out for her on the bed. She walks around the mansion. Another man, Matt (Eric Mabius) is there in the same situation. Suddenly, soldiers bust into the place. They take them downstairs. They see the Umbrella rooms and the underground Umbrella Train.
 The soldiers are James Shade (Colin Salmon), J.D. (Pasquale Alcardi), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and Spence (James Purefoy).
  Alice was a soldier too, but her memory is only coming back in bits and pieces.
  Their mission is to get to the Hive which is deep under Raccoon City. The Hive is a top-secret research facility, but getting through it will not be easy. You have biohazard zombies and other horrifying surprises.

  The cast also includes: Heike Makatsch and Jaymes Butler, Jason Isaacs.

  Screen Gems (remember them from television in the 1970's?) presented this film which is now part of the Sony Pictures Entertainment company.

It was put together as a quick promo for the original and got lost in translation somewhere along the lines. Notice how no new footage was show except for the last shot of the first? Now, marketers took it, added the title Apocalypse to the end,and used it. Talk about cheap! Now, onto the movie itself...
This movie in my opinion actually has a chance to be great... a slim chance. Under the direction of rookie filmmaker Alexander Witt, we may be in for a rough ride. Paul Anderson has returned for the script, goodie :-(, and Mila is back as Alice. The plus side to this movie is that it contains characters from the RE series including Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliveria. But most of all, the main reason this movie looks remotely good, it that Nemesis will finally make an appearance.

The characters aren't the same, and the actual story is different. Sure, it is good to have a different story, you don't want to copy everything from the game, but i think the overall idea of the movie, should be based around the game, because thats what everyone is familiar with. But no, it is completely different, and thats its biggest downfall.
 The characters of the movie aren't properly introduced. There is no background to them, so you don't care if they live or die. It seems that they were more focussed on getting to the gore instead of building up the movie.
 The zombies were my biggest problem. They didn't look scary at all. Half of them didn't even look dead. Looked more human then some of the people i see around in the streets these days.
  Overall a missed opportunity. I give the movie 1 star because Milla Jovovich has a nice body :P",1081987200,2,1029,4.516129032258065
2449191,4,B000BYRCR4,"For all those that think the first movie was upsetting....well.  For one, the reason it didn't go with the storyline of the Games was because they were basically showing how it all started.  *shrugs* Most wouldn't figure that out....and blood and gore...sure that's all good.  But just because it doesn't have enough blood, guts, and gore doesn't make it a bad movie.  It's the storyline that makes a movie good.  I'm all for blood, guts, and gore......but I also look at the storyline.  Sure...it could have been a bit better, so could other movies as well.  That's how the creators strive to make a movie better.  I'm a big horror movie buff...and I've seen all old movies that didn't have all those ""gorey and special graphics"" and they were all good as well.  Welp, that's all I guess.

2449192,4,B000BYRCR4,"I have never played the games, nor do I know much of the story behind it. Perhaps that is good, because I won't like many reviewers be lamenting that it differs from it. Although to be honest, even if I did know the games I doubt I would care. I realise that movie versions of books and games differ, and as long as the story is good that's all that matters. I enjoyed this film, it wasn't a 'hide behind the sofa' film, but then these days, what is. We start with a bunch of people in an office slash science lab being killed. We do not know why but this grips us. We then cut to Milla Jovovich lying naked (covered by a shower curtain) in a bathroom. She doesn't seem to know where she is and gets flashes of memory. The action kicks off from there with SWAT like operatives storming the place along with a man who says he is local police. The action keeps on giving from there. People die in a myriad of ways, and you don't get a zombie here or there you get them BOOM all at once. I'm not sure if this is good or bad. One the one hand it makes the task of escaping (which they must do in an allotted time or be trapped forever) all the more impossible. On the other it's not a big shock when we see them all again, and again. The big creature wasn't scary, or rather, it was if we believed it to be real but I didn't. The dogs were scarier in that sense because they are more believable. I liked that the film had strong female characters. Now, I am no feminist but frankly, I'm sick of whiny, girls who want the man to rescue them. From the beginning, I knew Alice would kick booty, I mean the woman wears a pretty little dress, with combat boots. Michelle Rodrigez is a tougher chick but she also shows she has feelings and therefore doesn't feel one-dimensional. It's an interesting film with nice little twists. The soundtrack is both good and bad because it is by Marilyn Manson. I say that because as it's by him the film is labelled as a worthless teen flick, which is not the case. It's good because - and while some of his music does suck - the tracks included in the film are good. Not too gory, this again is both a blessing and a sin. It's a zombie film so we expect lots of gore but the fact not much is added makes it not just be about blood but has to have a plot too.

2449193,2,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics. As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.
Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called ""The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.
We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.
As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.
Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement. For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.
There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.
The zombies in this movie are your basic ""pale and rotting skin"" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh. Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility. Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.
Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful. Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not. Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine. Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part. And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.
Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick. And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too. But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please. Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again.
Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident Evil might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch. It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.

I don't recall bein HIGH or anything, but i remember seein some of the same zombies in different scenes.  They die and then they come back for more later in the movie.  That was pretty strange.  Plus, there was barely any gore in the film.  Movies with zombies, mean movies with a ton of BLOOD AND GUTS!  I just saw the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD in theaters, and it makes R.E. look like a kiddie movie (rated G or PG).  The musical score of the movie, done by Marylin Manson, was AWESOME!  That kept the movie in a steady state of COOLNESS!  The acting was good too.  I love watchin Milla (Alice) runnin around (...)
  I really hope APOCALYPSE is goin to be good.  It should be, with NEMESIS in it that is.  (...)  In this next round of FUN, Jill is also joining in, and some other people, who i forgot about.  (...) this [may] be one of the best sequels ive seen in a while.",1079913600,6,1166,4.143497757847534
2449195,1,B000BYRCR4,"Where to start, where to start. I know... the game. Resi Evil the game was, and still is, one of the greats. It had everything you could've hoped for. Zombies, action, scaryness, and a conspiracy/mystery. The sequels continued the story, and once again great. They where like movies themselves. Now, lets look at the movie on its own before we compare it to the original game (resident Evil 1 - psone). The casting of Milla Jovovich, although she can't act, wasn't bad. It was the others who where terrible. Michelle Rodriguez... OH MY GOD, when she tried to act tough, i squirmed. The Story... oh yeah, there is no story. The zombies... people with a bit of grey make up and contacts (although the dogs where good). Action... Yawn. Scary level 1-10 (10 highest) -4. Sory to sound sarcastic, but it stunk. Now the comparison. With the game, you had a great story with real suprising twists. You had real terror, and great music to go with it. Even the characters where top (although the voice acting is the only bad point on this game). It was gritty, it never had mad sci fi gizmos... it was a true horror game with true horror survival game play and could've been easily converted in to a film. But no, Paul Anderson (One of the worst directors ever) some how gets the job to turn this great game in to a film. Instead of keeping to the story, he throws out all the work done by the guys at Capcom and uses the name to tell his own so-called story. he throws out the characters of resi evil and brings his own in. Who ever says this is a kick ass movie deserves to have there ass's kicked. I've heard this be called a prequel. If its a prequel, where's Albert Wesker. Bye this film at your own preil. Regarding the sequel, Apocalypse, i've seen stills of Milla and the new character, Jill Valentine (thats right) and four words come to mind, looks cheap and tacky. Don't let the trailer fool you. Kick ass film... yeah right... idiots. If the review sounds rough, sorry. Very angry man. Paul Anderson has destroyed any chance of a proper Game Adaptation with Resi Evil, With Chris Redfield the main guy, and Albert Wesker the arch nemeisis and the betrayer. I Hope the studios see sense and don't make a 3rd resi film, and leave it a few years for a proper director to come in and revive the franchise in the proper way.",1079913600,6,2322,4.427570093457944
2449196,1,B000BYRCR4,"I really don't like writing negative reviews.  I like to write about things I enjoy, it makes the process of writing reviews much more enjoyable.  But every now and again something so rotten comes along that I've gotta say something.  This is the case with Resident Evil.  Hollywood seems to be getting into a zombie phase these days.  This is scary coz Hollywood knows about as much about making a good zombie flick as I know about nuclear fusion.  History has shown us that all great zombie flicks have been made outside the system.  There are many reasons I hate this film, but here's the top two:  1) I'm a fan of George Romero, and 2) I'm a fan of the video game series.  Resident Evil is a game based on the works of George Romero, yet Romero wasn't allowed to do this film.  Just like a previous reviewer, I have also read some of Romero's original script for Resident Evil.  If he made it, it would have been superb.  Why wasn't it chosen?  Probably coz it was intelligent, it actually stuck very close to the story, it would have been about two hours long, and it would have been too gory for an R rating.  In other words-for people who like good horror films and not cruddy rock video type films.  Instead the studios figured that they'd go with Paul Anderson since he directed another lame movie version of a video game.  This film actually has a decent opening sequence, but falls flat on it's face afterwards.  Anderson decided to take it upon himself to change the story, and not for the better either.  Now everthing is all high tech and computerized.  Part of the scariness of the game was it's simplicity.  It's down and dirty approach to survival.  We have yet another clone of 2001's HAL in the form of a computer security system called the Red Queen(oooooh, scary).  Everything's a cliche in this film, no surprises.  The soundtrack is dated and annoying.  It's full of that lame Matrix slo-mo junk we've seen a million times before, as well as those lame VanDamme-esque slo-mo kicks and punches.  The ""Licker"" is pitiful.  I've seen scarier creatures in Fraggle Rock.  The cast is all pretty people, not real looking people.  All of the scientists in the beginning are hot women!  Yeah, right.  There's a scene stolen from the movie, ""Cube"".  There's basically no gore.  Sorry to sound so shallow, but the sad fact is that gore is required for a zombie film.  The only positive I can think of is the zombie dogs which looked good.  But that's the only good I could find out of an hour and forty minutes.  I feel so sorry for Romero.  He's really been getting the green weenie lately.  First, he's screwed out of Resident Evil, then some no-talent hack by the name of Zack Snyder remakes Dawn Of The Dead!  And this is Romero's genre!  He made this genre, now they're treating him like a doormat.  Accept no imitations and make it a Romero night!",1079395200,18,2866,4.521484375

The first Resident Evil was ok, to put it bluntly, the movie was very much different from the game as well as the books.  The movie also didn't contain enough action and therefor left one sitting there looking at their watch.  I would also watch which reviews I read here, as many of them are most likely written by 10 year olds who sit at home and play Resident Evil games all day.  Overall, as a Zombie genre fan, I can only hope that the release of Resident Evil: Apocolypse, as well as, the remake of Dawn of the Dead do great in the box office.",1078099200,,631,4.190082644628099

First of all, there's not much here in common with the games, other than zombies and an occasional mention of the T-virus or some other phrase from the games.  Secondly, there is nothing frightening about this movie.  Unlike the games, all the instances of violence/gore/shock come across as very campy rather than scary.  Actually, ""campy"" may be the wrong word to use, as that would imply a bit of lightheartedness- this movie takes itself *way* too seriously.
You feel very little tension or buildup while watching, and you'll find yourself looking at the packaging halfway through to find out what the running time is.  It's just plain boring.  And of course, there's a setup for a sequel no one is asking them to make.
The only impressive thing about this film is the performance of lead actress Milla Jovovich, who seems to be the only involved in the movie who realizes this is based on a VIDEO GAME, not Shakespeare.  She did a great job considering the quality of the movie.  On the other hand, Michelle Rodriguez gives an eye-rollingly melodramatic performance as the token ""tough chick.""  The other actors either just stand around, get killed, or most likely, both.

OK...but Nemesis will be in it and that makes up for anything that went wrong in the first one. I hope the soundtrack to be AWESOME!!!.

2449211,4,B000BYRCR4,"Let me say straight off that I have never played Resident Evil (I don't get the time). I found this movie to be great fun with a shocking opening. I can't believe the opening isn't listed as being scary. I mean think about it, you're just getting ready to go home and the fire alarm goes off, you try to leave but you're sealed in and about to get dosed with Halon gas. I watched the opening sequence and it chilled me, because at the time you don't know who's deliberately killing the workers. Then we meet Alice (BTW no-one names her) who suffers amnesia. From then we get into the Hive and the horror that awaits.
I enjoyed this movie and found it moderately jumpy without being a gorefest (I don't like proper gore flicks). To the reviewer who asked why Milla is running around in a red evening dress, I have to ask: Did you watch the movie? It's made quite plain that she puts the dress on because it is laid out ready on the bed and she doesn't get the chance to change.
So it didn't go everywhere like the game, well to be blunt, that works in a game but in a film, it would look patchy and disjointed. All in all I liked this film, Milla is sexy and kick..., Michelle is moody and tough and the sounndtrack rocks. Can't wait for the sequel.",1076025600,6,1248,4.204166666666667
2449212,1,B000BYRCR4,"This director really has only one good movie - ""Event Horizon"" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help ""Aliens Vs Predator"" with the way things are shaping up.
This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on...
When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy.

This film really moves along at a great pace, the Marylyn Manson soundtrack kicks it up a notch along w/ the action sequences.

I can't attest to its faithfulness in translating the video game franchise to film.  It does succeed in being attractive, stylish.  Michelle Rodriguez (seen on the cover next to Jovovich) rocked, giving one of those performances that will make you remember her name and look for her elsewhere.  Milla Jovovich delivered, refashioning herself again so that she looked nothing like she did in The Messenger or Fifth Element, balancing her character's vulnerability with ferocity and sex appeal.  The male characters were, for the most part, short-lived and forgettable.  Not that they gave poor performances, just that they were (mostly) supporting roles that doubled as h'ors-douvres.
The special effects were good.  The computer controlling the Hive 's defenses -- The Red Queen, seen in the trailer -- made a good character in the movie.  Resident Evil made good use of the state of the art for 2002-3.  The music melted into the movie, adding to the action sequences without otherwise interrupting the flow.  Action sequences were nicely choreographed.

Where is the Tyrant? Where is the music? Where is the ""world of survival horror? This movie is everything the VG is not. Which is exactly why I gave it two generous stars. People say, ""you can't expect the same thing, you can't expect all the puzzles and gadgets, you can't expect the same characters. Huh? What's that? Why call it Resident Evil? Paul Anderson has done great in the past, Mortal Kombat is a peach of flick if you ask me, and Event Horrizon was more scary than this and it was Sci-Fi. I don't get it either.
Paul, I know your a big director and I'm one of the little angry viewers that didn't ""get it"", but take some advice. Whenever you adapt something, be it a book or a video game, the idea is to truly stay true to the original by re-creating that atmosphere that made us jump at the zombies and the dogs crashing through those windows. The erie music that played over the vast rooms of the mansion and basements. The darkness that followed you everywhere. You did a good job with MK and I respect you for that. But I can't forgive you for what you did to a classic game and genre of Resident Evil.

Because she's a sex symbol, I somehow can't help but be amused by her obnoxiousness (i.e. the ""gas controversy"" when she collapses in the shower).  Michelle points out her favorite weapons and ""sick"" scenes, while joking about Eric Mabius's pepper and yogurt binging.  The James Purefoy comparison to James Bond is equally funny at the right moments.  Although the commentary group's timing can be off, the facts concerning movie production are also appropriately balanced (i.e. the Alice in Wonderland analogy).  Overall, they just seem like a fun group to make a movie with- you can tell they enjoy eachother's company. There are many memorable lines and scenes that become the joke subjects of the actresses, director, and producer.

2449222,1,B000BYRCR4,"The director of Resident evil, Mr Paul Anderson is a huge dissapointment to CAPCOM, the grey coloured playstation console and not forgeting the Resident evil fans world wide.
Now let me explain, why R.E is a dissapointment.
HISTORY OF THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT
The basic reasons are Paul anderson preffered writing his own script by adding additions in the movie which never exsisted in the game itself.
Before Paul anderson wasted his ink and paper on writing his script. There was a director of the name George. A.romeo.
He is the genious behind the zombie movies such as Day of the dead. His R.E script wasn't approved because he wrote the names of the real characters in his script. This is when Anderson was transferred and decided to change the whole script by using everything in his little imagination.
NO ORIGINAL CHARACTERS AND STORY
So how can this movie be a success, if the director cant even create the original characters of the game and get the authentic storyline. Not one original character is present in the movie, which is a huge dissapointment to the fans and CAPCOM's unappreciated efforts of creating the brilliant characters.
NO HORROR
The other major dissapointment is that the zombies and dogs looked pathetic, which i found more real terror in the 32bit game itself.
The movie should be aimed at children who enjoy watching goosebumps instead of being aimed at ages above 15.
SPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY
I would recomend you R.E fans or just horror lovers to think twice before buying this movie. If you are a R.E fan you are better off buying the resident evil comics, because the story and characters are related to the game. If you are a zombie horror fan, i recomend you to buy movies directed by George. A.romero and Fulci, thats the real stuff to get full satisfaction from your hard working money.
REMEMER,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED",1072483200,7,1850,4.784375
2449223,2,B000BYRCR4,"...on it's own, standard Hollywood fare. Don't go into this expecting a faithful take of the original ""Resident Evil"" game; that storyline was tossed out the window, with director Paul Anderson inserting his own cookie-cutter vision (lack of vision?), looking to cash in on the franchise name.
Anderson, in the liner notes, is called a ""fan"" of the RE video game series. Coulda fooled me, since his big-screen adaptation hardly has anything to do with RE. For whatever reason (ego? studio execs with zero inspiration beyond $$$?), Anderson decided to script his own ""prequel"" to the events of the first RE game. The game was a slow-paced creepfest, all about atmosphere. This film is typical Hollywood tripe, full of kung-fu babes, lame one-liners, wooden acting, obnoxiously-loud industrial metal music, and cheap ""things popping out of lockers"" scares.
The basic plotline: Umbrella, a sinister mega-corporation which profits from bio-engineering & genetic alteration aimed towards warfare while operating under the guise of a General-Electric type company, has a massive underground lab. Nine-to-fivers work there like they would in an ordinary office, live there, eat & shop there, shut away from the world above. This is all hidden under a pristine mansion. Some criminal jerk decides to steal a very lethal viral agent known as the T-Virus, intentionally loosing the virus in the process, causing all hell to break loose. Everybody down below dies, re-animate as zombies. A ""crack"" SWAT team swoops in to find an amnesiac agent and a do-gooder trying to bring down Umbrella. Zombies attack, and most of the squad dies in a laser room before most of the action goes down. Later, mutant dogs abd beasts attack, Milla does her ""Matrix"" routine....you get the point.
Anderson turned a great game series into a convoluted mess. There is no ""Red Queen"" killer computer in the game. No underground office workers. No Alice the Zombie Killer. The script is paper-thin. Here's a great example; Team Leader: ""Report, soldier."" Jovovich as Alice: ""What?"". Good stuff, eh? Michelle Rodriguez will make you wonder how she gets paid to act, irritating you beynd belief in the process. She plays a Vazquez-from-Aliens ripoff character, snarling the entire movie in an effort to play a tough commando chick. The rest? Uh, doesn't matter since you barely even learn any of their names. Bad zombie effects, mediocre CGI work (including some zombies), blasting music....meant as a distraction, I believe, from the awful screenplay.
There's no crumbling Spencer Mansion. No odd puzzles to solve. No lone zombie wandering a dark hallway. No mouldering tombs to search. No blackened catacombs. No Trevor family. No freak mutations like the massive snake Yawn, Plant 42, Lisa Trevor, the shark Momma Neptune, or the dreaded Tyrant. No moody atmosphere of being stranded in a remote mansion, looking for your missing comrades without a clue as to what happened. No horror of discovering sinister experiments. In fact, there's nothing in this movie that made the game so creepy and effective. It was all there; perfect source material to make a truly frightening film. Sadly, it was all trashed in favor of pretty actors and lame Matrix-like action. In other words, Hollywood took another promising franchise and turned it into the typical garbage that they churn out day after day. On it's own, the film is your average Hollywood action/horror job, indistinguishable from the rest of its ilk. As a RE film, it is a complete bomb & miserable failure.
Want a great RE movie experience? Buy a GameCube and the Resident Evil remake. The graphics are amazing, and the mood is perfect. Play it in the dark and you start looking over your shoulder. Want a bad RE movie experience? Pop this film into your DVD player and you start looking over your shoulder for the nearest exit. Shame on you, Paul W.S. Anderson. What does the W.S. stand for?

Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.
With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.
The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.
Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.
The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.",1068249600,7,1988,4.540389972144847
2449229,3,B000BYRCR4,"Based on the hit survival horror video game series from which it gets its name, Resident Evil does an adequate job of setting up a film franchise, but does practically nothing with the rich world available to it from its source material - it's all set-up and no follow through.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson does keep the pace brisk and the film uncluttered with too much detail, but a little more shading in the character department would have been nice, and having the two people who should know more about the facility than they actually do because of a nerve gas induced amnesia is just a dirty (and lazy) little cheat, narratively speaking.  Also the movie too often resembles other, better movies (i.e. Aliens, Dawn and Day of the Dead, etc.) instead of the games upon which the movie is supposed to be based.  Weak script aside though, the movie is visually exciting and fun to watch in its own way.  It just isn't the moody and scary experience the games are.  Hopefully the inevitable sequel will be an improvement and not another semi-successful missed opportunity.  For Resident Evil fans only.",1067385600,,1111,4.790575916230367
2449230,3,B000BYRCR4,"What to say about RESIDENT EVIL? Well, the film's director, Paul Anderson, is probably one of the most hated directors in Internet land and while I don't hold as harsh of an opinion on the man as many do, I still don't think he's anything great and I definitely don't think he is qualified to direct his next feature, ALIEN VS. PREDATOR. Anyway, that's beside the point. How did Anderson do with the adaptation of one of the most popular video games of all time? Unlike its video game turned big screen adventure predecessor TOMB RAIDER, RESIDENT EVIL isn't a total waste. However, at the same time, for as much action and danger as the story tells us is going on during the film we don't really see all that much happen.
 What RESIDENT EVIL does well though is the way it thrusts us into what we are able to see happening. In the first five minutes, several people are dead and we are introduced to the lovely and very naked Milla Jovovich who stars as the films lead character, Alice. Granted, RESIDENT EVIL doesn't break any new ground whatsoever with the things it shows us. The things we see throughout the film are actually borrowed from several other movies ranging everywhere from DAWN OF THE DEAD to ALIENS to that Bridget Fonda LA FEMME NIKITA movie. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch them again does it?
 I admittedly don't know that much about the video games of RESIDENT EVIL other than the fact that I know there are zombies in them so I don't know if the film is faithful to the video game or not. What I do know is that as shallow as it is, I had a pretty good time watching RESIDENT EVIL. While the film may be brain dead, it's still fun, popcorn munching entertainment.

2449233,1,B000BYRCR4,"I love the Resident Evil video games. I have been a fan since the first one was released in 1996. I love the storyline, the erie soundtrack, the creepy sound effects and of course, blowing the heads off of the walking dead. When I heard they were making a film based on it with George Romero directing, I went unconscious. I was so excited and couldn't wait to see it. Then, Mr. Romero was dropped from the project and it was given to the biggest hack in Hollywood history...Paul W.S. Anderson. Besides the competent Mortal Kombat, he has yet to make a film worthy of a one week run at a dollar house. This movie was shameful from beginning to end. Complete with faux-Matrix action, cookie-cutter acting, void of any horror or suspence and featuring CG that must have been made on a Tandy PC from 1988. He even trashed the storyline. There was no Red Queen nonsense in any of the games, and certainly no child hologram telling everyone they are going to die. And don't give me the excuse of it being campy on purpose. This movie failed on every possible level, including being one of those bad movies that never takes itself seriously and becoming a midnite cable classic. Anyone who likes this movie needs to see a George Romero film immediately. He is the one who started the whole zombie genre and it still the best at it. Once you see any of those films, you'll forgot about this one and realize how much better this could have been. Mr. Anderson is also helming the Alien Vs. Predator movie, due out Summer 2004. This movie has been in the works as long as the recent Freddy Vs Jason film. You'd be better off playing the 16 bit Sega game than being subjected to his desecration of it as a film. He is sure proof that talent and vision are traits not needed for a director's job in Hollywood.",1066521600,12,1797,4.4156626506024095
2449234,1,B000BYRCR4,"I don't know about the video game but I don't have to know about it and to be a bright one to see that the conceptors of the game were inspired by George Romero's cinema.
Take Romero's excellent movie, ""Day of the Dead"" (the third and last film in his zombi trilogy), add to it a big budget, plenty of computers and special effects and a couple of female stars, in order to grab the required audience, and you get that kind of predigested movie, that you forget as soon as you see it. The story is practically the same: a handful of characters trapped by a bunch of zombies in a closed, underground place, and who quickly slander each other for survival. ""Resident Evil"" is unfortunately typical of today's American action cinema: it's empty, noisy and brainless, in one word, standard. More than the story, totally trivial today - the virus theme has been told a hundred times, and in better, especially in ""Twelve Monkeys"" and in Richard Matheson's founder novel, ""I am Legend"" -, the biggest default of this film is the total lack of gore scenes, which is paradoxical for a zombie movie and the symptom of a politically correct U.S. cinema. Milla Jovovich is not very comfortable, the music, uselessly hard, is deafening and brings bad headache (but this is the fashion today), the beginning is totally taken from Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" and the ending, from John Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"".
This disastrous movie (but what could you expect from the director of pitiful ""Mortal Kombat"", also based upon a video game?) is a good proof that money and technology don't always do good to cinema.
A last point: it's George Romero himself who was first supposed to direct the movie. But he was put away after he brought a script we may suppose as 'gore' - and good - as his previous zombi works... Shame on the deciders! And shame on the finally chosen director! Your movie is a waste!",1066176000,4,1894,4.623145400593472
2449235,5,B000BYRCR4,"I had never played any of the Resident Evil games before this movie came out. When I found out it was based on a Playstation zombie killing game I passed it by time and time again at the local video store.
One day I'm kicking back on the sofa flipping channels when I come across RE on one of my movie channels. I loved it, went out and bought it immediately.
The story deals with a virus that was purposely released in an underground work/lab environment and causes the dead to rise and mutate on occasion.
A small group of survivors must navigate their way to safety.
That's the plot in a nutshell.
The storyline is good and original in my opinion and the characters are all likeable. You'll find yourself pulling for them and cringing when things don't always work out so well.
Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are certainly easy on the eyes. I especially liked Rodriguez's performance.
I've recommended this movie to several friends who've all loved it.  I hear ""Resident Evil 2"" is in production. Milla Jovovich will be reprising her role. I'm really looking forward to it.
After watching the movie I went out and bought ""Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 for my daughter's Playstation.  The zombies freak her out so she won't play the games but she loves watching me.
it's a blast. A real stress reliever for me.
Bottom-line: I'd recommend both the movie and the video games.",1066176000,,1378,4.597560975609756
2449236,5,B000BYRCR4,"This film was a very intense 2 hours of jumping and gasping. It is based on the popular video game series, but you don't have to have burned corneas or sore thumbs to enjoy this modern and believable zombie flick. For those who haven't played the game, Resident Evil was a spooky game to play alone and in the dark. The film is no exceeption.
 In short, a biological weapons manufacturer/gene tampering company has an accidental release in their facility and has been locked down, containing but killing the entire staff. The government funded security team comes to check it out and are shall we say surprised. Oh yeah, did I mention they were 200 feet underground?
 The cast did an excellent job and the director was true enough to the games to make any gamer happy. I also suggest to watch it with the commentary the second watch. You hear how intense the set and atmosphere was for the actors to work in. Also guys, you hear the ""real"" to life Milla and Michelle talk about a bar they ""visited"" on location. Something about underwear only?????
 If anyone is interested in a good scare Resident Evil is a good choice. Lots of blood,gore,and sexy women with automatic weapons.

2449237,2,B000BYRCR4,"""Resident Evil"" was, originally a series of really enjoyable video games. With a dark, creepy atmosphere that could make you jump out of your seat, it created a world in which you could easily go into. It also had the reputation of being a very graphic and gory game. Another great element of the games was the plot; you had to resolve many puzzles, and your intelligence was required to play.
The same things are not all true in ""Resident Evil"", the film.
""Resident Evil"" tells the story of a woman who had been rescued from a virus infested research center. She awakens later on, she has forgotten everything. After that, a military team takes her and brings her back in the research facility, when the effects of the virus are no longer contagious. They find that the release of the deadly virus was a conspiracy. But there are many problems on their way; some almost invincible zombies, a main system (which takes the aspect of a little girl) that wants to kill every intruder, and a security system that turns against them.
In the case of ""Resident Evil"", it's not the movie itself that is so bad, it's all those little things that are messed up, without ruining completely the quality of the movie. If you've seen ""Deep Blue Sea"" and liked it, then you'll love Resident Evil. As much as ""Deep Blue Sea"" was a very simple and common model of what a suspense movie turns out to be in Hollywood, ""Resident Evil"" is another clone of that model. What I mean by that is the presence of the similar elements, which mostly are: A good-looking girl, a bunch of men that get killed one by one, a spectacular enemy, some high-tech facilities and equipment, a very simple scenario, some violence (not graphic enough to gross out the average teenager, which is 80% of their target audience, but not mild enough to be rated PG-13), and some cool looking action sequences. It's a formula that works many times, and they chose it for a movie that promised so much, but did not deliver what the real ""Resident Evil"" fans like.
A movie that could have been so much more...I could easily criticize the plot, or the actors, but you know how it is, and we all know how it is. It's just normal, common, average...it has nothing special...it is an excuse to make a movie. I'll still have to admit that Milla Jovovich is not only a beautiful woman, but she's also a pretty good actress. Even though her role in ""Resident Evil"" did not require a lot of talent, she's still able, sometimes, to make us share the shivers she plays on the screen.
The points where I would focus a little more are two very important elements in the ""Resident Evil"" video games. Like I said before, originally, these games were moody and gory. Two major deceptions here. The gore...ARGH! I just can't take it, it's made by computer! This is a message to all directors: If you want to put any gore in your films, do it the old fashioned way. Digital blood looks fake, digital monsters look fake...Even with some very cheap gore/creature effects, you can do a better job than the one they did in ""Resident Evil""...the same thing is true in Blade...Every single mutilation in ""Resident Evil"" was made in CGI, and every single one of them really looks bad. (Spoilers) There's a part where more than half a dozen soldiers are cut in pieces by lasers (and it really deceived me to see that three quarters of the human characters die in two minutes...human characters were the only hope of seeing a gore scene in this film, because the zombies in this film have coagulated blood, which is, for sure, realistic and intelligent, but absolutely not satisfying for the gore fans) and some heads are cut off, some bodies are cut in cubes. But every darn death looks so fake! Even in the excellent low-budget Canadian movie ""Cube"", the effect with the guy that gets sliced into dices is really, really, really, really, a thousand times better than all of ""Resident Evil""'s reunited gore moments. I'm sick of CGI gore...and all CGI made movies...this is removing all the human aspects of movies...people are amazed to see things that were made with computers and almost look real...Yeah, they almost look real, but if they were done like before, they would look even more real! Well, what is the point of being impressed with things that could be a lot more simple and look better if they were done like before...It's not because technology exists that films should overuse it...Technology is a tool, and many film makers don't understand it.
The other aspect, the mood, is not delivered the same way...it's more like a futuristic atmosphere, with a certain lack of terror, a very ""Blockbuster"" atmosphere, with nothing really eerie. The music is not bad, but it certainly is not as creepy as the one in the games. The zombies are not scary at all, and the other ""creatures"" are plain laughable.
They kept some elements from the games, and that's a good thing. The city is still ""Raccoon City"", the train really is identical to the one in the game of ""Resident Evil 2"", (Spoilers) the city in the end really seems to be an image taken from the game, it's the Umbrella Corporation, etc. But, talking about that ending, which is actually pretty good, I would have seen the whole movie setting in the Raccoon City streets, like we do in the beginning of ""Resident Evil 2"" (the game).
Overall, I'd say that ""Resident Evil"" really is a disappointment, especially if you were a big fan of the games, but for those who haven't heard of the games and saw the movie and thought it was good, you should definitely check these games out! ""Resident Evil"", the movie, is a very common piece of entertainment, that, without being bad, simply offers some acceptable entertainment, some mild thrills, and an easy and agreeable night at the theater. It really is nothing impressive, but it's very ordinary recipe of Hollywood thriller that puts itself under a name that has acquired reputation with the years. Not that bad, but nothing great either.",1065484800,4,5977,4.650283553875236

One being that it's based off a Japanese video game called ""Biohazard"" suitably renamed ""Resident Evil"" for the states.

I however went ahead and bought the movie. To my surprise the flic wasn't bad at all. I expected certain things to be ""stolen"" from other flics especially in the horror genre but then again they're all rehashes of each other really. The story was good and the CG kept up with what the director wanted to portray. Don't expect a whole lot from Resident Evil but it's worth placing in your collection definately. I know you have worse titles in there already so at least you're on your way up with this one.

The special effects on that big creature thing are so-so, but the zombies are well done. The part where the military commando guy was pulled into a room full of zombies gave me shivers and I can't imagine what that would feel like and it gave me chills just thinking about 50 or more zombies pulling at me and taking chomps out my face.

The ending is cool, in where Jill steps out of the hospital to find Raccoon City taken over by zombies. That tells you that there will be more movies, and that sends a happy chill up my spine. The director of this movie is same director of Mortal Kombat, which was a laugh and a half. Some parts were good, but PLEASE!

Resident Evil: The Movie is set prior to the goings on of the game series, and explains how the T-Virus was initially released by a corrupt Umbrella Agent, seeking glory.
The Movie starts in 'The Hive', an Umbrella Secret Laboratory directly underneath Raccoon City. A figure is securing the virus in a briefcase, and happens to accidently let one capsule slip, splintering over the table edge and the floor, releasing the deadly virus into the air vents.
The Red Queen, the super computer of 'The Hive', discovers this Biohazard and immedietly takes action to prevent it's spread, sealing in all who work in 'The Hive'.
The story moves pretty quickly, considering that it only goes for little over one and a half hours, but the plot twists near the end as you get to know Alice, and Matt Addison, and all the cast of the Umbrella Special Operations Team.

2449245,4,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is a movie version of what is called ""Survival Horror"" in the gaming industry.  The ideas and a number of scenes are directly inspired by the Resident Evil Games.
Milla wakes up, naked in a shower and has no memory of the past.  She is in a large mansion.  Soon she is beset by commandos who claim she is one of them and that they work for the Umbrella Corporation.  In the mansion is an underground train station that leads to a large underground research facility that is in trouble.
In the facility, known as The Hive, the team is trying to shut down an AI computer that killed everyone in the facility.  Aside from the killer AI, there are plenty of zombies and even a monster.  The team must defeat these and get out before the facility becomes completely sealed.
Milla's character is central to the movie and she slowly regains her memories as the plot advances.  We come to know her better and feel sympathetic for her.
All of this is bound up and painted with classic elements of horror and action and blended so well you don't really notice the switches.  Camera angles, stunts and atmosphere really push the viewer's buttons and keep the fear and adrenaline running.
As the film nears its conclusion, the viewer tries to guess just what is going to happen and how it will be resolved, but the surprises keep coming until the final scene.

2449246,5,B000BYRCR4,"When I was younger (much younger) there was a movie venue in America called the ""drive in.""  Folks pulled up in cars, attached speakers to their windows, and watched movies on a large wall set in an enormous field. In my day, the drive in had two uses. One: it was a place where you took a girl on a date because you were too young  to have your own apartment and not worldly enough to get a hotel room. When used like this, you and your date simply steamed up the windows in your old man's car, and it didn't matter what the movie was. The other purpose of the drive in was to go with a gang of your friends (with one usually stuffed in the trunk to save the price of one ticket) bringing in as much beer and wine-cooler as you could stuff under the seats. Resident Evil would have made a perfect drive-in movie, and frankly, I loved it.
The gore was well done, barrowing from Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Night of the Living Dead. Milla Jovovich is a pleasure to look at, scampering through the whole affair in a miniskirt, and she displayed a real flair for action as well. Finally, there is just enough good story and plotting to keep you brain at least idling.
Nope, it's not Citizen Kane, but then sometimes that's a good thing. It was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, who always brings a certain integrity to all his work, and at the least this is a carefully crafted movie.

2449248,3,B000BYRCR4,"Ok I am a huge Resident Evil fan.... I have all of them except RE:Gaiden and RE:Survivor...(survivor I hear sucked)...
If you are a huge Resident Evil fan this may not make you very satisified.... The reason why is because only certain parts of the game are in it. For instance, Zombies, The T-Virus, Umbrella Corporation, and a small scene of Raccoon City, oh and the Licker from Resident Evil 2. But see, just because they have all these things doesn't mean that it's going to be as great as playing the game because the movie really is just like playing the game because all you do is walk around this place called ""The Hive"" and try to disable the Red Queen. Now what would've been VERY smart is if they would've had Stars Alpha team be the people who investigated because the other people worked for Umbrella, which kind of made me angry because I hate the Umbrella in the game! They make me so mad with all those lies but hey it's just a game... Ok now here are the facts..
PROS:
Very nice Commentary w/ Milla Jovoich (Actor), Michelle Rodriguez(Actor) , Paul Anderson (Director), Jeremy Bolt (Head Producer).
Very good acting, I personally liked Milla Jovoich's kicks and moves, she's good!
Enough Action to satisfy anyone... Lots of Zombies
CONS:
The parts of the game they put in here are not very well designed, for instance, The Licker. The Licker is the weird bizarre creature we find in Resident Evil 2 on the ceiling of a Police Station in Raccoon City. Well see the thing is that this Licker design in the movie is not completely a clone of the one from the game, so it's not quite like The Licker you'll see in RE:2.
Not well Budgeted..... This movie was not well budgeted and here is why... When you see that lady in the elevator about to get her head chopped off after the T-Virus is released, why don't they show the head get chopped off? LOL Michelle Rodriguez complains about that on the commentary. This movie is Rated R so why can't they show that much gore? Paul Anderson (director) said that the movie had insufficient funds to possibly make gore and stuff. So that was lame. Also Michelle never got to use her knife, and it was because they didn't have enough time or money to show zombie guts getting taken out.
The Ending was terrible.... WHAT THE HECK HAPPENS! THATS SO ANNOYING YOU CAN'T JUST GET AWAY WITH THAT! The ending leaves you wondering if Matt turns into Nemesis cause that doctor says ""I want him in the Nemesis program"". And where is Jill Valentine? Where is Brad Vickers? I will give them credit on one condition.... IF THEY PUT JILL VALENTINE IN THERE! WHAT THE HECK WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE IN RESIDENT EVIL 3 THE CITY IS NUKED AT THE END! So how could Alice (milla jovoich) possibly get out of Raccoon City? Thats gonna be an outrage if they do not put something about Jill Valentine on there. Also they MUST have Nemesis! They must because he was part of the story!
Final Point: This movie is good but not great.... The story line isn't good enough.... But lemme tell you the commentary is great, one of the first I've been happy to hear. So good bye yalls and thanks for reading",1055980800,,3120,4.475438596491228

I enjoyed the story and it was quite a thrill ride.  In this day and age of corporate greed and coruption, the story fit in nicely.  We don't want those corporations getting out of control, do we?

2449251,4,B000BYRCR4,"This movie is part of the famous Resident Evil video game franchise and is a side story for what is occurring in the games. The special forces in this film are not S.T.A.R.S. They are actually working for Umbrella corporation. The contamination in the game series occurs several months before S.T.A.R.S. team Bravo is sent in to investigate.
Umbrella tried to cover the accident up with its own special unit and the R.P.D. (Racoon city's police department) were in charge of the murders occuring a few months later outside the mansion. When the R.P.D. lost control the S.T.A.R.S. were called in to investigate which led to the first game. Bravo team had problems when they arrived at the woods outside the mansion in the movie. Only a few made it to the mansion. Alpha team was sent in to rescue them but they were attacked and the chopper pilot, Brad Vickers, fearfully took off without them.
The remaining Alpha members made it to the mansion and so Resident Evil the game started. Resident Evil Zero, the game, shows what happened to the Bravo team.
So if your expecting the movie to be the first game then your going to be disappointed. But remember it was never billed as being a movie based off the first game, instead it was billed as being a part of the franchise. This is what happened to the members of Umbrellas special unit. Several months after the events in the movie, the game begins.
The movie is very well done. It isn't a gore fest, so it doesn't seem over the top. It is well directed and the special effects are very good. If you like zombie movies, or the game series then you should like this movie very much. That is unless you expect this to be the first game in movie form. Think outside your shallow viewpoint and your sure to enjoy a little side story you probably will never see in the game franchise.",1055289600,2,1829,4.5120481927710845

2449253,3,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil will probably never win any awards for subtly, acting or writing but it does satisfy the urge to watch an interesting horror movie. The original game was really a knock off of the concept from a number of previous movies (Night of the Living Dead, Warning Sign among many others). It's lack of originality is more than made up for with an imaginative production design and nicely paced narrative.
The plot is as simple as the game. There's dangerous research going on in the Hive. Someone has stolen a lethal virus that turns whomever it kills into flesh eating zombies. A crew is sent in to discover what's happened to the Hive when the computer shuts it down killing the infected staff of 500 workers.
It's clear that Paul Anderson's film owes a huge debt to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. While George Romero chose to inject an element of savage satire into his trio of films, Anderson plays his film as a straight ahead thriller. There's lots of close ups of gruesome things. The most clever and original element in this film is making the persona of the central computer into a little girl.
This isn't anything heartwarming or original about Resident Evil but it's a fun thrill ride for fans of the original game. It's a pity that Anderson chose not to add any additional subtext to the film as it would have given him and his performers more to work with given the thin narrative. This superbit edition has improved resolution (particularly noticable on a progressive DVD player and HDTV) when compared to the previous, regular editon. Is it worth buying again and paying more money for? Frankly, given the film itself probably not. It's not a surprise to see this film released in the superbit format (vs. more deserving films)as Hollywood has learning to fleece customers many times for ""new improved"" product.",1054425600,,1865,4.706422018348624

Packed with terror, gore, and action...Resident Evil brings the game to life on the screen. Every actor in this movie was great. Every creature was amazing. Every piece of music (composed by Marilyn Manson) fit the scenes.
This movie is one of my top recommended movies of all time. If you love Horror or if you loved the game check it out. It is SO worth it.

2449255,3,B000BYRCR4,"Fun flick, but one minor complaint...
I am not a huge fan of the Zombie genre, but enjoy them quite a bit.  I understand the ""rules"" and like watching a movie that works well within it's own particular idiom.  I can say the same about Romantic Comedies, Documentaries and Action Adventure flicks.  When they're done well I enjoy the heck out of them.
That having been said, Resident Evil compares favorably among it's fellows.  I'm not going to discuss plot because there are a few hundred reviews posted here on Amazon that explain pretty much everything.  Besides, you really don't want me to ruin it, do you?
There is more action than gore, but it's pretty graphic action so Argento freaks may not walk away happy but the rest of us will have a good time.  There is an Aliens type feel to the elite military team, but the characters are very broadly sketched and there's not a lot of feeling for them as they fall victim to the beasts and nasties that inhabit the lair beneath the mansion.  Still, seeing a few hundred zombies ganging up on five or six well trained commandoes makes up for the lack of characterization.
As far as the effects go, my only complaint is the CGI work on the most monstrous of the beasties.  The concept was excellent, but the execution left a bit to be desired.  Resident Evil is based on a computer game and the monster looked like he was lifted right off a Playstation and dropped onto the set.  I actually chuckled at one point when he was climbing up a wall and looking over his shoulder.  My finger automatically sought out a fire button to waste his sorry behind.
All that having been said I do have one major complaint about this flick.  Are we supposed to believe that these folks live in a world where there has not been a single zombie movie ever made?  Reanimated dead folks, shambling through corridors trying to eat human flesh and none of these crack commandoes have the presence of mind to try a head shot?  I know with small arms it's advisable to shoot for the center of the target, but how many rounds do you put into something's chest before you try another target?  It's a small complaint, I know, but just once I wish a character in one of these movies would have seen a Romero movie some time in their life.
Long and short of it; decent effects save one CGI character, a decent plot and wall to wall zombie killing action...  I can think of worse ways to spend a Saturday night.",1053734400,,2432,4.431460674157304
2449256,5,B000BYRCR4,"I've read many of the reviews here at amazon.com.  I find it interesting how what is considered ""a minor film"" has brought on so many ""Love it""/""Hate it"" opinions.  I (a non-gamer) fall in the ""Love it"" group.  I've read criticisms of the beginning of the film and how it is hard to follow.  It seamed quite apparent (to me) that you were supposed to be confused in the beginning so you could identify with the main character that has lost her memory.  I thought it actually brilliant how things become clearer to the viewer as the effects of the knockout gas wear off of Mila Jovovich's character.  I am also surprised that people can watch a video-game based film and have such high expectations.  I went into this thinking, ""I sure hope there's a lot of special effects and good action"".  I came out of viewing my rental thinking, ""That was so much better than I expected, I must own this!!""  Heck, I thought ""Mortal Kombat"" was a passable video game adaptation; Full of action, had a story, fair acting.  I'm not sure what people expect when a film like this comes out.

Here's my reasoning behind supporting this DVD;
-There is actually a story in this film and it requires your strict attention.
-Better than average acting for a film of this genre.
-Visually stunning.  Pay attention to how color (and the lack of) is used.
-So it has a metal soundtrack... what did you expect?
-Sound quality is very good.  ""Whisper"" in the vent is very subtle and creepy.
-I have never played the game.  This is the film, not the game.

What to look for;
-Not much gore.  Some will find this disappointing.  I personally don't think it matters.  There is an ample supply of blood however.
-More tension and suspense than scares.  I think this film has a great emotional edge to it.
-Great character development.  You might care when they die.
-George Romero Zombie rules are in effect; Blow to the head, infect with bites or scratches, and eat the living.

-Laser room is a great moment in horror film history.  If it does not freak you out, then I don't know what craziness you've witnessed.
-Plenty of good extras for the money.

I personally looked at this as a film, without consideration to the video game.  That comparison is no more fair than comparing ""Lord of The Rings"" films to the books.  Sure, we all want a reasonable level of ""faithfulness"", just be fair to what you are looking at.  I believe the only fair way to judge a film is to keep the media separated.",1053648000,2,2466,4.510158013544018

The movie's opening was confusing, the acting was mediocre at best, and the music, as usual, is totally forgettable. Any movie with zombies has the potential for being scary, but Anderson's pounding metal score ruined any atmosphere the film could have had. All of the monsters, save a horribly adapted Licker, are cut from the movie. The entire movie was painfully boring, save one scene involving a security laser, which was the only redeeming thing about this horrible film.

Everything that made the games so overwhelming - the feeling of dread and isolation, the brooding music, the terrifying jolts when zombies crash in on you, the complex relationships between the characters, the paranoia of who can be trusted and who not, and above all the excellent story about the mother of all corrupted corporations, Umbrella - all this has been reduced to nothing.
Instead we have yet another Matrix ... with thumping techno-soundtracks, a Lara Croftian tough babe with more one-liners you can recall, ... cgi, mind-numbing action (so what do you do when a zombie dog comes running for your throat? You whirl around mid-air three times and kung fu kick it right in the face!), and predictable plot twists.
The only redeeming ingredient is Milla Jovovich, who actually tries to put some depth in her character. Overall the best actors in this film are the zombies.

If you pay enough attention to the film the basic concept of the story line is simple enough even for people who may never have heard of the video game to understand.

The movie is about a team of highly trained special forces commandos who are dispatched to the Hive (an underground Umbrella facility where viral research was going on) who find out that all the specimens and employees have been infected with the T-virus. The special effects in this movie are superb, look at the way the zombie dogs move, real dogs move the same way. Every undead creature looks very realistic, they aren't covered in tomato sauce or anything fake like that. The special effects are arguably as good as those of The Matrix. Paul Anderson even took the time to make sure the plot info concurred with the info given by the game and books. A big step up from the Mortal Kombat movies.

  The movie tells that, in The Hive, an underground Umbrella Corporation laboratory, a computer who controls the whole laboratory, called Red Queen, killed everyone down there when she found out a virus was released inside. To prevent contamination outside The Hive, Red Queen closed every way out of The Hive and killed everyone. After that, a team is sent to ""turn out"" the Red Queen. What will they find? That's what you'll see... (See more about the movie in my Resident Evil - Movie Showtimes Review)
  It's rated R because of Sci-Fi/Horror Violence (zombies, blood, this kind of things you see in the games), language (some f-words, s-words...) ande brief sexuality/nudity (you can see Milla Jovovich's breasts and vagina, real quickly).
  The 5.1 Surround Sound is really good, and so is the image (Widescreen). The main menu is animated, there are the Scene Selections, audio in English and French, caption in English and French.
  The main extras are:
  - Making Of: A basic Making-Of.. How were the main scenes made, some things are said about the Red Queen corridor... You know, it's a Making-Of...
  - Scoring Resident Evil: Tells about the movie sountrack. How was it to be working with the antichrist superstar Marilyn Manson and the classic musician Marco Beltrami? Was it easy? Or was it really hard to mix both styles?
  - Zombie Make-Up Test: It's basically some zombies running around the screen.
  - ""My Plague"" Music Video by Slipknot: It's the video of the main song in the movie soundtrack. It mixes and Slipknot show with movie scenes...
  - Cast & Crew Commentary: Paul Anderson (director), Milla Jovovich (Alice), Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) and Jeremy Bolt (producer) make a very interesting and funny audio commentary.. Lots of humor, one of the greatest commentaries ever in my opinion...
  - Costumes: A basic movie explaining how were the costumes created, how did the cast and crew felt about them...
  - Set design: The name tells everything.. How were the sets designed, what was the most difficult...

The zombie make-up creator was brilliant and made the other zombie movies look like 80's movies (no offense). The suspenseful parts really made me jump, like when you think the people are really survivors, you put your arm around them and get a chunk clean right out of you. The first zombie really freaked me out, she was really well done and played a good, fairly short part, LOL, credit to the make-up artist. While watching the movie I came across the first undead scene and heard some really great Manson. Manson's scores were really well done and went along with the movie really well.

Another bad thing is the fact that the whole movie takes place in a weird underground facility. What happened to the glamourous mansion and dilapidated laboratory? The game doesn't take place in some shiny, futuristic complex. Another problem. I guess the good parts of the movie are action sequences when fighting the undead creatures. The zombies also look good, but sometimes the creatures look like unscary crap! Who likes that? Take a look at the version of the Licker and you'll see what I'm talking about. There are some very well done jump scenes, such as with the man being attacked by his sister. But others are deliberately there, trying to be suspenseful. Then, after you freak slightly, it turns out to be nothing at all! The movie was well-done, but too short, sometimes boring, and untrue to the game.

2449275,3,B000BYRCR4,"This movie is EXTREMELY UNDERRATED. No, it's not a classic. No, it's not an academy award winner. But it does succeed where many others have failed.
First, the good things:
1) THE PACING, ACTION, AND SUSPSENSE are some of the best I've ever seen in a film. This film has a real sense of urgency and moves along at a breathtaking pace. It jumps from gloomy suspense to exciting action all within minutes. Both aspects are done very well; the movie will excite you with its visceral action scenes and scare you at the same time.
2) THE ACTING is well done. While much of the characters aren't explained through dialogue, their body movements and subtle gestures to each other make you learn much about the characters. Some of the acting is a bit sketchy, but it's good enough that it comes to the point where you care when some of the people die.
3) THE MUSIC AND PRODUCTION DESIGN: The sets are wonderful and completely convey the high-tech, computerized feel that the movie is about. The music also flows with the production design and the acting, so everything feels in-sync. And by the way, the music greatly helps the picture, whether its the booming base during the battle scenes are the subtle high notes during the suspensful ones.
4) THE PLOT IS GREAT. The director has the characters face so many enemies (alive, undead, machine, chemical, etc.) that the movie keeps surprising you and makes you keep guessing. It unfolds as a mystery and with the characters trying to pick up the pieces throughout.
And the bad things...
1) THE LENGTH was too short. At only 94 minutes (not including the credits), it didn't leave a lasting impression and I was forced to watch it again to get a better ""feel"" for it. There could've been much more character development and some of the sets created great places for some outstanding action scenes. Unfortunately, they are not to be seen.
2) THE SPECIAL EFFECTS could've been better. Seeing the Licker push its way out of the metal cage always looks fake to me. But, they had a low budget so the Director did the best he could.
3) THE ENDING, although good, should've been replaced with the alternate one. According to web interviews with director Paul W.S. Anderson and the commentary, there was a huge, action-packed ending with Milla Jovovich using the same gun that the ""One"" character had. A chance for more much-needed action. The ending presently in the movie is good and leaves room for a sequel, but I think there was enough scary stuff in the movie and it needed more action. Also, the ""climatic"" battle with the Licker on the train was sort of a disappoinment.
All in all, a solid video-game to movie adaption. It still has many problems, but you can do MUCH worse that sit through and enjoy this. Trust me.  3.5 stars.

Awful acting, horrible writing, meaningless techno music and a poor storyline make up the hellish experience of sitting through this film. Apparently the filmmakers, the crew, and the writers never picked up a controller and actually played the game. The film is NOTHING like any of the Resident Evil games. Like most recent films, Resident Evil was made to draw in a younger audience, or any audience that would pay for that matter, not necessarily to make a ""good"" film. A supermodel was hired to play the leading role, rather than a professional actress; her acting is awful. This movie symbolized to me, everything that a zombie movie shouldn't be - Big budget, ""modern"" (techno music, computer graphics, unrealistic kung fu performed by a person that hasn't ever even taken a class in any form of kung fu, etc.). Basically, the newest member of my favorite genre (zombie horror) is one of my least favorite movies ever. Please, don't buy this movie. It seriously is in contention for the ""worst movie ever"" award. Consider yourself warned.",1046476800,7,1192,4.905940594059406

I hate head-banging, it gives me a headache; and I'd love to give a swirly to every goth guy I've ever met....still I like the movie. This movie shows how wrong our obsession with new scientific advancement can reach. There is a point of no return in creation sytems. Thus movies, games, etc. like Resident Evil try to remind us that we are very fallable; consequently, messing with scientific areas such as cloning, viral exchanges, and re-animation needs a precision we as humans aren't able to meet yet. This is not a gore movie made for every hack who pretends they worship the horror genre, but a what-if movie that provides us a wake up. We need to respect the knowledge we've discovered and it's abuses, or resident evil will be upon us. It doesn't take a doomsdayer to figure out this movie is scary because of its reality.",1046390400,,1130,4.599009900990099

The detail gone into the sets like the mansion, the zombie dogs, the sound effects, even the way some of the characters talk is like Resident Evil-the game. The music is innovative, exciting and moves the movie along nicely. Each scene is filled with action and there is not a scene in the movie that is slow or bogs the movie down. Mansons music is great. Milla Jovovich is perfect as the lead kick arse character Alice. Michelle Rodriquez is excellent as the tough as nails Rain. Not one actor is miss casted in this film. I'm so glad director Paul W.S. Anderson did the film right, justice has prevailed. When I first heard that a Resident Evil movie was getting made I instantly thought that some hot new upcoming actors would be cast ie( No this can't happen), but no I was over the moon and over joyed when I found out that Milla Jovovich- one of THE BEST ACTORS around and of her generation,was going to play the lead. I then knew that this film had a chance of being grouse. So if your thinking of buying this film, it is a diffinite must for any fan of the genre.

this DVD is absolutely crystal clear and beautiful as is the soundtrack.  The special effects are very good, and I enjoyed watching the very well dressed but incredibly stupid special hit team get their collective butts kicked by zombies and monsters.
I am retired special forces and watching small units in military action in both war and horror can be a hoot.  I found Michelle
Rodriguez to be disgusting in her cheap imitation of that incredibly ugly rapper ICE T. She continually tried to look out
the top of her eyes while tilting her head down while scrunching
her face up like ICE T.  She tried talking like him, and rolling
her head around like him, and tried to be so macho while failing
miserably.  She was uncontrollable and left the unit at times to
solo recon which is a cardinal no-no in that type of situation.
Aside from that this movie is a one dam good zombie stomping movie and the end leaves you dying for the sequel which is coming
in 2004.  I highly recommend this movie to any horror buff who

2449284,5,B000BYRCR4,"You probably know what the movie is about from all the other reviews so I'll just talk about some interesting aspects of the movie commentary which I always like to view after the real movie and maybe you will too.  Director Paul Anderson, Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovich, and one of the producers Jeremy Bolt were all in the commentary, which is quite a crowd to talk in.  A few times all of them talked at once making it difficult to hear, but for the most part it was humorous and informative to hear how the movie was made.  Surprisingly, Michelle was the one who seemed to talk the most and I gained a new respect for her since I'm only familiar with her moody characters (ie Fast & The Furious, Girl Fight).  She had to attend with the other soldier actors a commando school on how to fire weapons, walk commando-like, etc.  Lots of remarks about the sets and how the movie was the director's attempt to have RE be a subtle comparison to Alice in Wonderland (really!).  Milla was engaging, didn't do a prima donna act, but she seemed uncomfortable or didn't comment when the director mentioned how hard she worked and than shot a Loreal commercial between her RE scenes.  Another surprise was that Michelle and Milla were big gameplayers of the RE game and approved of how the director used camera viewpoints similar to the game, the scratching of the dogs nails on the floor, etc.  The director commented mostly on how shots were done, lighting, music soundtrack were done. Jeremy Bolt didn't talk very much, but it was interesting to find out that the budget for this movie was very small so using redundant scenery and actors over and over again was a must. Jeremy ended up being one of the zombies killed, reapplied different makeup on him again and killed him in 2-3 other times.  His sister and girlfriend also got to be zombies probably for no pay.  Other interesting facts about the movie was how the cast was hungover on champagne or wine before a critical battle scene, funny to hear everyone laugh about it.  One sobering fact was the scene at the beginning of the movie when the commandos invade the mansion.  The mansion hall was actually a WWII era nazi bunker w/ padded cells for interrogation.  Chilling to hear how the cast members felt haunted there and wouldn't go anywhere by themselves.  The movie was shot in Berlin so access to this bunker and also an existing underground train system somewhere under the city provided ready made sets w/ minor changes for the movie.  Just some interesting trivia about the movie that I thought was cool so buy the movie and enjoy!",1045094400,2,2597,4.6152173913043475

It's about time we got people on the screen who can carry a line as well as shotgun. As far as the DVD the highlight was surprisingly the commentary. Paul, Milla, and Michele are hilarious. Commentaries are usually straight forward and a little on the dull side but this trio of crackups just had me rolling on the floor.

2449286,4,B000BYRCR4,"I was a bit worried this movie would be nothing but another bland horror attempt, but thankfully Resident Evil is far more. It has the visual effects, the soundtrack, and the acting to really shine. The story is complex enough to keep you guessing, but simple enough to let the action flow. Resident Evil is the truly first good horror movie in quite some time.
The visual effects of RE are quite unique. A beautiful mix of all CG scenes with live action really puts that video game fill into it. The often overlooked fact is that as a RE gamer, you usually have at least in part a lot of info on the world around you. You know things you couldn't otherwise know. For example, how things work, maps, where things are, etc. This movie does a great job of keeping the viewer informed in this manner, without going so far as to ruin the surprises. As for the undead, this movie is unmatched. The way they move, moan, and even die is exactly what any RE fan will expect. It's really good to see the attention to detail.
The soundtrack is every bit as cool. In the theater it sounded incredible, and it certainly doesn't disappoint at home. For all of those out there watching on some crud two speakers system... you'll miss out. The movie just doesn't have the same punch without the deep bass and creepy ambient surround sounds around you. For all of those with the system to handle it, you'll have a new showcase title for your DVD collection.
As for the acting, the downfall of so many movies, it's simply outstanding. You really do feel as if you're watching an elite squad of jaded specialists. It's somewhat like Starship Troopers, in a different setting. I really felt convinced of the performances. When they're hurt, they act hurt. When they're scared, they're scared. There's very little room for uncertainty here. If they actors aren't upset about being injured, or scared of the death that surrounds them, then it's quite hard for the audience to be concerned either.
Resident Evil manages to not only get the job done, but to excel. It should pass all expectations you may have for it, and surprise you a few times as well. It certainly ranks among my favorites as an action / horror flick. I honestly believe it would even if it didn't have the game series behind it.

2449288,4,B000BYRCR4,"Funny thing is, this movie manages to be very entertaining and well made, despite being absolutely nothing like the videogame series it was based on.  Oh sure, you've got some famous monsters from the game.  There are zombies and for a few scenes some lickers, but the suspense and claustrophobia the game was famous for gets thrown away in favor of violent action.  The eerie fixed camera angles from the game are ditched.  The bloody hallways, and creepy silence is lost, and instead we get a futuristic science lab type building.
  But still, I found myself enjoying this movie anyway.  It reminded me an awful lot of Blade and Blade 2, so anybody who is a fan of those two movies should check this one out.
  All in all, I think I would have enjoyed a movie with the spirit of the game a lot better than this action oriented film, but it is still very fun and worth seeing at least once.

2449289,4,B000BYRCR4,"To begin with, lets get one thing straight, video games do not make great movies. Like books, video games are a different sort of medium and when turned into movies are usually nothing more than cool bad movies. With that said, I was really surprised by RESIDENT EVIL.  I had never played the video game, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie uses film techniques and cliches borrowed from a host of other films, e.g. THE MATRIX, ALIENS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD just to name a few. Yet, the movie sucked me in. I was enthralled by it. I got caught up in the action and the story and kept wanting it to go on.
There isn't much dialogue here and therefore the acting is limited to physical reactions, facial expressions, body movement, and action sequences. The movie starts off slow and confusing with the seemingly hodge-podge of scenes not making any sense. However, once the background to the film is given and after a few flashbacks are seen, things begin to fall into place.
The movie is classified as a horror movie. However, it's really more of an action/adventure or sci-fi movie with a little gore and for a horror movie the gore is rather tame.
I've read a lot of mixed reviews about people who have played the game. Some say it strays from the games plot, while others say (with the exception of character changes) stays pretty close to the original video game. I don't know. However, I do know that I really didn't think I would like this movie, but I ended up liking it and was thoroughly entertained for 90 minutes.",1044403200,,1538,4.492857142857143

2449295,3,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is pap, stupid, predictable, violent, idiotic mayhem ... and I loved every minute of it.
I bought this DVD on a whim, and next to ""We Were Soldiers"" it was my favorite film of 2002. I laughed, shouted out advice or predictions, had a few suprises, and am maybe in love with Mila Jovovich. She looks simply fantastic, all wetted down in that little dress with her leather boots and kicking zombie butt.
2002 had two revivals of creature feature mayhem at it's best; ""Eight Legged Freaks"" with it's Giant Mutant Spiders On The Loose theme and the adorable Scarlet Johanson, and ""Resident Evil"" resurrecting the Zombie Movie for the Internet generation. Every possible Zombie Movie convention or style is shamelessly ripped off or recycled, with doses of ""Aliens"", ""The Andromeda Strain"" and even ""The Matrix"" thrown in for good measure. The film even boasts repeated, close-up views of Digital Readouts [of varying colors] ticking down until the film's implied doomsday. I am a connesiour [sp?] of Digital Readout movies, and ""Resident Evil"" has the best Digital Readouts I have seen since ""The Six Million Dollar Man"". If you want to watch a movie where you are constantly reminded of how long the plot has until doomsday, this is the movie for you.
It is also a movie that helpfully reminds its viewers of exactly what is going on every ten minutes or so by having a character list the plot details up to that point. This is done for the benefit of viewers who may have calculated that a run for the restroom is about due during the theatrical runs, and helps jar the memory of those who may not have been paying attention to every minute of the DVD. I found that helpful, because the people I watched it with and I were constantly discussing what was going on to the point where we were talking about the movie more than watching it. ""Resident Evil"" is an interactive film, and requires a sense of humor in addition to a strong stomach.
I am sorry that I missed seeing this movie in a theater; two of my fondest cinema visits were the aforementioned ""Eight Legged Freaks"", where each and every one of the audience members were interacting with each other and the movie. And ""Starship Troopers"", which I saw in NYC with an audience that, like me, were besides themselves with hilarity during the entire running length. ""Resident Evil"" is very much a film in the same genre, and as such delivered the goods, and is certainly due for some sort of ""cult"" status as time goes on. It is truly Something Awful.
But you know what? I'd rather have fun watching a movie than be subjected to an additional three hour purgatory like the two films that will probably contend for Best Movie this year [Peter Jackson's seriously bloated ""The Two Towers"" and Martin Scorcese's overtly ponderous ""Gangs of New York""]. They are fine movies to be sure, but it is refreshing to find a film that takes the gas out of the art form, and does it with a wetted down leather booted Mila Jovovich to boot.",1042848000,,2993,4.62781954887218

2449300,3,B000BYRCR4,"I wasn't sure what to expect when ""Resident Evil"" fired up, so my pre-conceived notions were minimal.  I've never played the game, and thus have no bias from that viewpoint.  To summarize the movie:  Another movie where a lot of people die and then come back to life, running around and attempting to eat everyone in sight.  How many times have we seen this plot?
Even though the plot is a retread that we've seen more times than we can count, there are a few nifty differences.  I loved the underground train.  I know.  What is the difference between the underground train and any subway?  In this case, it's the fact that it is under a house, leading to a top secret facility.  Furthermore, the train plays an important part in the end of the movie that has some top-notch special effects.  Some of the best special effects in the movie, in fact.
The hive was an interesting concept that the director spent just enough time on to provide a background for the plot, without spending so much time on it that you felt like it was time to go make popcorn.  I also liked the concept that Milla Jovovich and her male partner lost their memory and regained it throughout the movie.  However, the transition from memory loss to memory gain felt a bit jerky, and wasn't covered well by the pseudo-cool flashback sequences that weren't all that well done.  The best special effect was a super cutting laser effect that plays in a couple of deaths.
After these cool things, the movie is basically a bunch of people running around in zombie makeup trying to kill and eat the people still living.  There were places where the director tried to infuse a modern look into the movie by the way certain shots were set up and by laying a metal rock sound track to make everything seem more impressive than it really was.  Lastly was a heavy coating of blood on everything, as though that is sufficient to cover the spots where the creativity weakened.
I am glad I watched the movie, which will likely be the only time I ever watch it.  Not a terrible movie, but not terribly good either.  If you are relatively new to the zombie genre, you might find this movie interesting.  If you've seen very many of this movie's predecessors, such as ""The Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and the numerous imitators, then this movie will be same old, same old.

It gave people goosebumps, it made you afraid to walk down dark hallways after you played it, and for the more timid, yet determined gamers, it made you do things such as sleep with some sort of weapon next to you, and the lights turned on. But this movie, every single shred of it was horrifying - horrifyingly stupid, that is. If the rating system could go any lower, I'd rate this movie about a negative 3 stars. I'm ashamed I actually bought a ticket to go see it, may the lord forgive me for being such an imbecile.",1040169600,6,1335,4.88546255506608
2449306,4,B000BYRCR4,"I have never played any of the ""Resident Evil"" video games, but I understand this film is very faithful to the storyline -- specifically, it serves as a prequel to the first game (the end of the movie is apparently the beginning of the game). As a video game adaptation, this film is one of the most solid I've seen. Yet it takes most of its cues from the video game paradigm, and is constructed somewhat like the video game we all wish we could play.
All the elements are here: The Red Queen, the AI which controls the movie's environment, is like the ""dungeon master."" It's a lethal adversary, yet it provides backstory, context, and objectives, i.e. the ""mission"" of each ""level."" Its primary goal is the extermination of the human characters, yet it bargains with them and even at times saves them for various purposes, rather like the way the rampant AI Durandal behaves in the famous ""Marathon"" game series.
The main character, Alice, arrives in the movie just like a video game character: No weapons, no clothes, no memory, just a heightened perception and a suite of deadly combat abilities. In order to work out her own situation and objectives, she must collect weapons and useful items along the way, and rely on her observations and on the exposition provided by others (as in a game's cutscene). That exposition, furthermore, is provided in a deliriously perfunctory scene executed as efficiently as a military operation, as if the filmmakers acknowledged the unfortunate necessity of this action-halting story element and decided to get it over with as quickly as possible.
And finally, there are the scores and scores of irretrievably feral zombies, which provide limitless guilt-free cannon fodder for the main characters to slaughter. This is something every action game provides in one form or another: Sufficiently independent humanoid enemies that are nevertheless so unquestionably evil (Nazis, Imperial Stormtroopers, alien invaders, demons, zombies) that you can blast away at them without reservation.
As a film, ""Resident Evil"" lacks a compelling storyline, deeply drawn characters and even well-choreographed action sequences. Instead, it focuses intensely on cinematography, production design, sound, and editing. This actually makes for a more interesting film, since nearly every frame is a carefully constructed movement within the scope of the film. Its goal, put simply, is horribleness. This movie, like other films such as ""Final Destination"" and the director's own ""Event Horizon,"" elevates the terror of danger and death to an art form. How terrified can you be before you die? Getting shot in the back or killed in a car accident is tragic and even painful, but at least it's quick. The anticipation of a baroque and cruel death is milked dry in this film. Irony, too, is an important factor, as in the case of the businesswoman who squeezes halfway out of a stranded elevator only to find that the elevator's about to start moving again.
Although this film sometimes gets bogged down by inconvenient practical considerations (like having to get from point A to point B), and the unending horde of flesh-eating zombies tends to get old, it's a slick, carefully-made and professionally produced distillation of horror that's as fascinating as it is artful. The music and photography are excellent, and if you have the technology to watch the DVD in Dolby 5.1 Surround, you'll love the sound work. It also provides a few fresh twists that defy conventional action plots, and a beautifully rendered ending which inverts expectations at the same time as it satisfies the story's arc.",1040083200,3,3616,5.078991596638655

Next, a specialist security unit has to get in to discover what happened. What they discover is row after row of coffin like containers, each housing one of the now dead staff members. And, of course, they're all brain-hungry zombies just waiting to get let out!

Do not rent this expecting a horror film. It is simply a movie about a video game. I will warn you that this is a film that starts kind of slow. Be patient for the first 15 -20 minutes. When the team finally gets to the red queens lair you will have been suprised once. I will not ruin it for you. Pay attention to what the teams mission is and try to figure out the relationaship between the two people (Jovavich and the guy found on the train). Try to figure out who is the ""badguy"". This is a enjoyable film if you go into it not expecting it to be the best film of the year (although hollywood is producing less and less competiton each year).

I have played every Resident Evil game that has came out and I loved every single one of them.  One of the things I liked about the game was the well developed plot.  This movie does a horrible thing to that plot.  First the movie is about a a virus that allows the dead to come to life as zombies that wander lifelessly feeding off human flesh.  First the mansion would have been better left off the movie entirly it served no purpose other than to give us a few glimpses.  Whatever they did to the police teams was atrocious and it still leaves me confused.  The movie throws you into a situation where the police are holding people hostage during a raid on the house.  I must say the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent special effects, but they do not make up for the mutilated and awkward plot that was created.",1038441600,4,942,4.223463687150838

Michelle Rodriguez is one of my favorite actresses. I thought she was perfect for this movie because, she was extremly tough. Milla was a very good person because of her unique fighting skills. This movie deserves five stars because the plot went right along with the whole movie and didn't change automaticlly without any sort of reason why. I especalliy love the fight scene with Milla and the mutant zombie dogs, along with the way Michelle shot the he** out of the first zombie that they encountered. One of my favorite quotes is ""I shot her six times, how was she still standing?"" the bit** isn't standing now."" The look the Michelle gave that guy was perfect. My only complaint was why did they have to kill Michelle? and why was she the only one who had to suffer with getting bit or scratched about 6 times! What I thought should have happened was her and Milla were going to be the only ones who made it out. I hope they make a sequel with they probally will, since there are so many video games. My opinion is this time the guy who got scratched my that huge mutant spawn looking creature returns, and Milla is the only one who can stop it, maybe the thing will only want Milla. Kind of like a Halloween Trilogy with mutant zombies. Maybe they can make the whole coming back of Rain [Michelle]thing work without it not making since. The best directors!

I even noticed similar sound effects and background music at certain points of the movie!

Jovovich stars as a cop/heroine who gets mixed up in the whole ""zombies taking over the world"" thing.  But she has amensia and doesn't remember she's a cop, or what she was doing before it all started.  My favorite scene is in the tunnel of lasers where everyone was sure to met their demise.

While I grudgingly accept that far out tales are what make science fiction actual fiction, let's have some grounding in reality, okay?  This isn't the best movie I've ever seen, and far from the best sci-fi adventure I've watched, but it's certainly worth two hours of time.
The basic plot deals with a an elite group of characters trained for combat who are sealed underground in a complex known as the ""Hive.""  A deadly neurotoxin is purposely filtered through air vents and kills all who it comes into contact with.  Supposedly.  Soon you discover than while the toxin kills unmercifully, it also reanimates the corpses of its victims!  Think Frankenstein en masse set loose in a labrinyth.
Milla Jovovich is a capable actress, but good acting really doesn't drive this movie.  She's at least believable.

Yes, it's as pathetic as it sounds, but there's some pretty good action. For the most part, though, the film fails to generate the intense frights that the video games have. The zombies really aren't that terrifying, but the special effects and makeup are very well done. As for the story, it's only mildly interesting and very obviously incomplete.

Andy Warhol once made films called ""screen tests"" that were close ups of people's faces and nothing else because he claimed people just go to the movies to look at the stars anyway.

2449326,3,B000BYRCR4,"I've played every Resident Evil game and book there is and I have to say what the heck is this movie about?  I mean if you're going to call it Resident Evil you might want it to look and be as close to the game as you can.  When I heard the movie was coming out I couldn't wait to see it...but now that I have I wished I didn't.  The script was terrible; it took away from the whole resident evil series.  Originally the whole plot was Umbrella Corporation was creating genetically engineered B.O.W. Weapons.
From the start things were terribly wrong.  The mansion (if you could call it that) wasn't even what it looked like in any of the games and the hive what the hell was that???  Both the mansion and Raccoon City had its own underground labs. And the Red Queen what the hell where they thinking?  That took away from what could be expected to be a great screen play of the popular Resident Evil games.  R.E. gamers expect if you have zombies and the other nasty creations where is the scientists who created them?  The scientist in the movie look like college graduates rather than medical geniuses who would research on something like the T-Virus.
There was no mention of S.T.A.R.S. the G-Virus or even William Birkin, who was the man who created the T-Virus. That would have made this movie more worth while to see. It would also have cleared a lot of things up and made the movie sell more.  The zombies both portrayed what they did in the game because they weren't all messed up because they don't decay fast.  I thought that the licker and the zombie dogs were also a really good touch.  But the movie would have been better if there were a little bit more monsters like hunters, zombie crows, and the infamous Tyrant.  They would have made this a better movie.
The acting was good considering the bad script.  Actresses Milla Jovovich (Alice) and Michelle Rodriguez (Rain Ocamo) did really well.  The scripting and design on the laser room scene was bad.  The whole team could have just stayed but the front or back doors where the laser beam couldn't hit them (because the glass wall didn't extend to the doors) would have been a smart move. But instead you have 3 butchered commandos and one diced leader.
In all, this movie to Resident Evil gamers is a partial upset.  And its replay life is only a couple of times.  But for all you suspense/horror movies this one is your movie.  It contains many thrilling parts including zombie carnage, action packed gun battles, navigating through a dark murky sewer, and a high speed train slug match between the living and undead.  This is an especially good zombie movie even though it isn't as gory as some but the suspense is what makes it a good movie.
Although this movie had a lot of changes and upsets it is still a good movie.  The movie also left off at a good spot where the other one could pick up on.",1034899200,,2867,4.44359464627151
2449327,4,B000BYRCR4,"I have to say I wasn't that bothered about seeing this movie at the cinema, I've only played the game a couple of times and didn't really get hooked on it. So I have no idea why I bought it on DVD, but I am glad I did.
You don't have to know anything about the story behind the game to enjoy the film. I thought everything was explained really well, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) losing her memory and throughout the film having flashbacks was a good way to do it. The zombies were really well done, and the cgi Licker was good for the ammount of money spent on the picture, even though it sometimes seems as though it does quite fit into it's surroundings, like when it bursts out of it's holding box it looks a bit fake, too computery if thats even a word.
The part that surprised me was how fast the commandos die, but more to the point the way they die. The laser mesh was an excellent idea and really well done, even though the director admits it's taken from a film called Cube.
The special features were quite good, even though I'm not a Slipknot fan I think the song really suits the film and the music video is pretty cool as well. But the best feature is the feature length commentary. I had never listened to a commentary all the way though until this one. It doesn't just comment about the film but a whole host of other things. Milla and Michelle are really funny along with the director and producer, especially taking the p**s out off Eric Mabius and his yogurt adiction.

2449328,2,B000BYRCR4,"Not being an owner of a game console such as a Playstation and the like, I have never spent much time actually playing any of the Resident Evil series. I tried to play them on my PC, but it always seemed like my top of the line PC was being dumbed down by playing console games on it, like it was getting a headache trying to think on the same level as a console. That said, I have however seen the games played by many of friends and know the Resident Evil stories, read some of the comics and a couple of the novels. I know and like the characters and all of the playable ones like Claire Redfield or Jill Valentine. Both have one quality, among others, that Mila Jovovich lacks in abundance- her character Alice is not very likeable. In fact, she isn't much of anything, she isn't even that attractive.
 The Resident Evil movie also has very little in common with its console video game forebears- other than it's title and that it has an evil corporation named Umbrella which has made a terrible virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Now, to me, this sounds like a match made in heaven. I'm a graduate of the George A. Romero school of zombie flicks and cut my teeth on Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead. I make no apologies for like spectacular gore- I want to see people being ripped in half with their intestines and other organs spilling out on the floor with wet goopy splatting noises like a bowl of rotten fruits being tipped over. I want limbs hacked off. I want people using 500 bullets to kill something instead of using just one. I want Peter Jackson `Bad Taste' and `Brain Damage' level gore. Resident Evil the movie has flesh eating zombies, but very little gore, very little actual eating of flesh. Almost none. So, what's the point?
 Anyway, the film is pretty much an amalgamation of some of the game stories, namely the virus being released and Umbrella trying to cover it up by gassing the residents of a watch house after someone attempts to steal the virus and purposely releases it. Alice, who awakes in the shower, has no memories of her past and is suddenly thrust in the middle of a commando raid as Umbrella attempts to gain access to `The Hive'- their massive underground research facility where the `T'-virus was made and subsequently released. Now, in the video game, everything Umbrella owns is made of rusted steel and looks to be about a hundred years old or painted a sickly medicinal green and splattered with mud and blood. The film, however, everything is cut from polished stainless steel and aluminum, all very sanitary and high tech, which doesn't fit the milieu.
 The commandos realize they'll have take down a powerful hologram-based AI known as the Red Queen, because she controls the whole Hive and they suspect she's insane. Entering through a glass corridor we get to watch as most of the team is cut into meat by lasers, including the grid laser seen in the commercial. But they wimp out- we barely see Number 1 cut into giblets Sylvester-running-through-the-chain-link-fence style, and get a semi decent slow motion decapitation. Now, in my mind, after the first laser had passed and killed two of the commandos, the next obvious move would be to roll a couple of grenades down the hallway- made entirely out of glass!! Instead, no, everyone dies, leaving only Alice, three commandos and a ineffectual cop to deal with it all.
 All in all, this film is nothing like the video games. None of its characters are likeable and truth be told, I wanted them all to die. However, the production values are very high and they obviously put a lot of care and thought into the end product. I'm also a big fan of Jon Anderson- Event Horizon will always be one of my favorite films. But in Resident Evil he changed too much, took too much away from the games that made them so effective. Very few of the monsters made it to the screen save for the lickers, which were underused and the undead skinless dogs, again, underused. Notice I have said much about the zombies? I haven't because there aren't exactly a lot of them, nor a lot of scenes with them.
 It's a zombie movie! For crying out loud, this is what people paid money to see and they give a very poor account of themselves. In this is where the film really falls apart- the zombies just didn't look dead enough, for the most part. It's like the make-up artists gave up before they were finished. The zombies didn't looked decayed enough, weren't feral enough, weren't missing enough body parts or bleeding enough. In short, they were one of the least satisfying portions of the film. I want gore...not scene after scene of high tech equipment and mean spirited characters with very few redeeming qualities. Dawn of the Dead could get away with being a character drama as well as a satirical portrait and scathing indictment of our consumerism-based society. Resident Evil is about gore and killing zombies in as many disgusting ways as possible and nothing else. Worse, the music had me reaching for an icepick to puncture my own eardrums it was so terrible.",1034208000,2,5067,4.594475138121547
2449329,3,B000BYRCR4,"The first time around, the movie was good. The second time, the movie was still good, but the flaws were very noticable. The utmost of those flaws directly involves Anderson and Milla. He is too busy attempting to steal every Hitchcock trick in the book, while Milla walks around looking pretty but acting very vapid. She shows off her wonderful body a few times, so I don't fault her for not doing much.

The DVD quality is spectacular. The picture is amongst the best of any DVD--and the DD 5.1 sound is better than it was in theaters. Unfortunately that spectacularity does not extend to the special features. No, what you get is: some lame trailers; some even lamer behind the scenes footage (Milla is fine as hell, so just be sure to use the pause button frequently); and you get the worst commentary in years.

The commentary of doom!

It is packed with people: Director Anderson, Producer Bolt, Actresses Milla and Michelle. But the problem here is Milla, only Milla. Apparently she never learned what a commentary is, and is shocked when it is explained to her (""you mean we talk for the whole movie?""). Anderson and Bolt make numerous attempts to describe the set-up to a shot, or any number of other technical matters, but Milla won't have it. All she does is joke around, really bad jokes, and interrupt anyone who talks. She makes fun of the movie, bashes her male co-star repeatedly for something SHE did, and generally acts a fool. It is really sad. She may not be the best actress, but most people assumed she was intelligent: European woman, speaks multiple languages... But she plainly shows us the woman underneath the beauty. Milla is a moron. Too bad.

2449334,3,B000BYRCR4,"Torn. Yes, this is how I was left feeling when the move came to a close. Let me explain:
  I was filled with much anticipation & excitement hearing of
this action-packed/sci-fi starring two female roles: Milla Jovovich & my new found favorite, Michelle Rodriguez(Girlfight). I have followed Milla's early modeling career back when she graced the covers of Nov & Dec '89 issues of Seventeen Mag up until her movie career. She has played a variety of charectors far from her 'model persona'. But to put her in a flimsy red dress & black leather boots to fight off something capable of destroying mankind? It strays away from her role as Alice, a strong member of a covert security team which she specializes in
hand-to-hand combat, not to mention martial arts skills assured to leave any 'livingdead' DEAD. I'm sure they thought a slight peep of her thighs would keep our attention. What they don't realise it's those rediculous decisions that make a film flop. Milla took what she was given & did the best she could: to [beat down]& look cute.
  Then there's Michelle Rodriguez. She rightfully is dressed the part of a commando. 1st class to be exact. No frills and she does not need any. She has a certain mystique and charisma that no lipstick or fancy wardrobe could come close to.
  Although I believe the script was poorly written and we, the audience, were not fully introduced to the charectors as individuals, I truly feel the actors put all they could in this film.
  Oh yeah, it scared the hell outta me, and the soundtrack was great. The fight scenes left me at the edge of my seat.
Maybe someday we can have it all in an action or sci-fi: great writing, well rounded plot, interesting charectors, & most of all, leading ladies getting the job done and takin' names later.",1033171200,,1782,4.634920634920635
2449335,4,B000BYRCR4,"I THOUGHT THIS FILM WAS EXCELLENT, CONSIDERING IT WAS MADE BY THE BLOKEY WHO MADE MORTAL KOMBAT. IT WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND STARTED ALMOST STRAIGHT AWAY AND STAYED TRUE TO THE GAME IN MOST RESPECTS EXCEPT FOR THE CHARACTERS NAMES AND SOME OF THE PLOT. I LIKED THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO MUCKING ABOUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE CHARACTERS KILLING THE ENEMY, UNLIKE MANY FILMS WHERE THE CHARACTERS HESITATE TO KILL RESULTING IN THEIR OWN DEATHS; THE CHARACTERS IN THIS FILM DID WHAT YOU WOULD DO AND USE ANYTHING AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO ENSURE YOU DONT GET KILLED. ANYWAY, I THOUGHT THE EFFECTS WERE VERY GOOD TOO, THOUGH BEING AN CREATIVE PERSON WITH AN EYE FOR DETAIL I THOUGHT THE 'LICKER' (THAT HUGE, SALIVATING, SKINLESS THING WITH THE TONGUE) COULD HAVE BEEN ANIMATED A LITTLE SMOOTHER AND THE LIGHTING ON IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DARKER, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT STOOD OUT A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON SCREEN, THOUGH THE DETAIL ON IT'S MUSCLES WERE SUPERB. THE SCORE DEFINATELY DESERVES A MENTION; THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ASPECTS THAT MADE THE FILM FOR ME BECAUSE IT HAD, MARCO BELTRAMI (THE CROW:SALVATION AND BLADE 2 SCORE'S), PROVIDING THE ORCHESTRATIONS, MARILYN MANSON PROVIDING THE HARDCORE, ATMOSPHERIC, INDUSTRIAL ROCK AND JUNKIE XL PROVIDING THE DANCEY, TECHNO, SOUNDSCAPEING AND THEN THERE IS A NINE INCH NAILS TRACK IN THERE THAT SOUNDED LIKE IT INFLUENCED MARILYN MANSONS PART OF THE SCORE EVEN THOUGH THIS PIECE OF MUSIC IS TEN YEARS OLD... IVE BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK, WHICH IS ALSO VERY GOOD, BUT I WISH THEY WOULD BRING THE FULL LENGTH SCORE OUT, IT IS VERY ATMOSPHERIC, DRAMATIC, HEAVY AND DANCE LIKE AT THE SAME TIME, IF THEY DO PUBLISH THE SCORE IT WOULD BE A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SELF RESPECTING FAN OF ALTERNATIVE LISTENING.
...THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FILMS, THERE'S NO HARD TO FOLLOW PLOT AND THE ACTION COMES THICK, FAST AND FAIRLY GOREY (THOUGH ITS NOT THE GORIEST FILM EVER). IF YOU LOVE THE GAME YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS...",1032825600,,1917,4.674556213017752
2449336,3,B000BYRCR4,"but, not terribly scary... I guess I was hoping for this to be a real terror-inducing ride, and although it certainly has it's unsettling moments, I never really found myself checking the corners for zombies afterward. However, what it lacks in chills, it more than makes up for in pure, stylish violence. Milla Jovovich jump-kicking the rotting hounds is a standout scene, and there are plenty of those slow-mo bullet shots (ala The Matrix) that directors seem to dig so much these days.
But, in the end, the film left me longing for more scary. It seems that the director abondoned the elements that make the game such a terrifying thrill, replacing them with sleek sci-fi action. Not that that's a bad thing really but.. let's just say it would have been a lot creepier had it been modelled a bit closer to it's interactive counterpart.",1032652800,,839,4.7534246575342465
2449337,5,B000BYRCR4,"First of all people say this is a rip off of other movies ie: Night of the Living Dead. Well in a way yes but this movie is also it's own movie.
Resident Evil is based on the fact that a Virius infects the hive which is an underground research facility. This causes them to turn into Zombies which is the basic plot of the Movie and the games so it cannot really rip off night of the living dead when it is based on the game which has zombies in it.
To really understand this movie you have to understand the game so unless you are a zombie fan, video game fan or someone who enjoys watching movies like this then you may not like this. This movie isn't for everyone, But from my point of view this movie was a really really good movie, great plot and sepcial effects as well as sound and cast.",1032480000,,794,4.063694267515924
2449338,4,B000BYRCR4,"First of all, I'd like to say that this is a very brainless movie. It plays out like an extended video game cinema, with lots of gunplay, yelling, zombies, and zombie bites. The characters are essentially movable, bendable action figures, complete with clip-on weapons and pre-recorded lines. The only difference is that when they get ""broken,"" they can come back and eat your flesh. I hate it when that happens. The actors include Milla Jovovich (who likes to look intense) and Michelle Rodriguez (who likes to glare at people from behind her eyelashes). They do their best, and manage to create fairly believable characters. On the whole, though, this is mindless action fare that most people will hate.
Wait, I'm not finished. I didn't hate it. I was entertained. I'm not a fan of the games and have never even played one, but I still enjoyed this. If you're looking for pure entertainment and pulse-pounding action, look no further.
The movie begins in the Hive, an underground research facility, where the employees' day is somewhat ruined when the doors seal themselves and poisonous gas gushes from the walls. So much for them. Cut to: Alice (Jovovich) waking up in a deserted mansion with no memory of who she is or how she got here. Before she has time to get over last night's hangover, all heck breaks loose and she ends up down in the Hive with an eco-warrior (Mabius), a fellow amnesiac (Purefoy) and a bunch of military commandos (Rodriguez, Crewes, Salmon, and some highly expendable extras for added flavor). Their mission is to kill the sentient computer running the hive, but first they have to contend with the dead employees, who are back as hungry zombies, thanks to a nasty genetic virus. Throw in some undead dogs, rounds and rounds of gunfire, a killer computer, security lasers, a heavy metal soundtrack, and ""The Licker"" (don't even ask), and you've got yourself a gripping action flick.
There is nothing I can say in this movie's favor. I could say, ""Why is it that Rodriguez yells 'we're running out of ammo!' near the beginning of the movie, but no one ever actually runs out of ammo?"" I could say, ""Zombie dogs? They just look like a bunch of dobermans who rolled in Black Forest cake!"" I could say, ""I don't care if you loved him! He's a bloody ZOMBIE! Wipe that shocked, tragic look off your face and RUN!"" I could say, ""What were these people paid to be in this film and will they ever live it down?""
But I won't. Despite all its flaws, I enjoyed this movie. In terms of gripping action and terror, it delivers. If there's a sequel -- and you KNOW there's gonna be a sequel -- I plan to see it. So shoot me. Because you know I'll come back to get you.",1032480000,2,2684,4.59375
2449339,3,B000BYRCR4,"'Resident Evil' has me wondering if I should lean towards personally classifying it a Sci-fi rather than Horror.  The movie was teeth-gratingly full of tension, however, I did not even think to jump with suprise once. I was impressed with the fluidity of the CGI animation, this coming from guy who scoffed at the inconsistent skin movement of the Jurassic Park dinos (I was a School of Visual Arts NYC computer animation major.)  The story line had very few flaws and did a great job of setting the premise for those who had no idea about the game. Movie viewers who are jazzed by the idea of flesh eating undead must seek out and watch 'Return of the Living Dead,' which should satisfy the urge for horror with a splash of comedy.  Great sound, dazzling visuals and a good score make this movie an attractive addition to your DVD collection.",1032393600,2,843,4.6066666666666665

2449341,1,B000BYRCR4,"Lame, shallow and dumb, are just a very few words I will mention to describe this movie.  This movie's is basically a bunch of speical effects strung together by a shallow story line that really does not end with any real resolution other than to look out for part 2.

On top of that you may notice that this movie ""samples""  ideas from other movies such as Andromeda Strain - compare the Hive to Andromeds's underground installation as well as the Hive's computer system to the automatic self-destruct mechanism in Andromeda Stain.  Speaking of computers, where else have you seen a computer go on a killing spree? Here's a hint 2001. Another steal was from Night Of The Living Dead where dead bodies are hijacked and commissioned to wreak havoc on the living.

If you want a real thrill get your self the game and start playing.  You will get 10 times the substance and all of your money's worth.

Quite frankly I do not see what is so not helpful about this.  Obviously those who did not find this helpful have no idea about the game in which this movie is supposed to be based on.  Surely it's packed with a lot of suspense and action, but it did not follow the game in anyway.  I found this movie lame and somewhat of a rip-off from other movies.",1032220800,2,1251,4.423580786026201

So if you keep your expectations low in comparing it to the games,it's an enjoyable enough action flick.

2449343,3,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is yet another movie based on a video game and I must say I don't think it was that bad. Sure the Zombies are no where as scary as the ones in Romero's films, just seem more like people with rabies than the living dead, lol. What I was surprised about though was the acting, it wasn't all that bad. Think Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) gives her best performance yet, Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast & the Furious) is pretty good too. Getting rid of George Romero was the biggest mistake though as I was really looking forward to a come-bat. Mean the director of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead doing Resident Evil would of been a dream come true. Sure his scrpt that was canned was much better too.
  Well anyway despite that let down, besides the acting I also liked the action, especially the train sequence at the end. Think there's a little too much confusing in the very end though, leaves too many loose ends. For instance there's a certain character whose fate really isn't clear and who you don't see again, guess they're planning a sequel. As long as they have a better script, scarier zombies and the sexy  Milla Jovovich returns I'll have no problem with that.",1031961600,,1201,4.474885844748859
2449344,1,B000BYRCR4,"Yeah this movie is terrible. This film relies completely on those slit second scare tactics. Where it's really quite one second and then there's a loud noise which usually turns out to be nothing. When there is something, such as a zombie, it's not scary. The zombies are very boring. They stumble slowly to their victims. They're so frail you'd think they could just be pushed over. Which is how it is in the 'Resident Evil' video game. Which is why this game never should have been made into a film. I do like the games but the plot just isn't strong enough for the big screen. If they want to make a scary game into a movie they should have chosen 'Silent Hill.' It's not so corny. Not all video game movies are completely stupid. 'Tomb Raider' managed to faithfully bring Lara Croft to the big screen and actually improve her image. Sorry Capcom, 'Street Fighter' failed and so did 'Resident Evil.'",1031961600,,902,4.539877300613497
2449345,5,B000BYRCR4,"When one critiques a movie they should stick to the movie and not stereotype people that would watcch it and then also call it trash on top of that. Also people who are ""hardcore"" Resident Evil fans should grow up and stop complaining that the movie was nothing like the book OR the video game. What kind of movie is that? It would be entertaining but just a rehatch and nothing more. Opinions are fine but one should not have to sit through others bashing on someone elses work. Paul Anderson is great admirer of the series and he knew how to translate the video game with flare.
This movie however, created something new that did not steal from the video game and still kept the edge which fuels such a movie or video game. ""the only thing I found upsetting was that too many people died too quickly in the ""Cube"" scene. Oh well. And for everyone who thinks the movie didn't fallow the video game the next movie sticks itself a little more to the setting we are all used to.
I recommend this movie to anyone: fans of the game, horror, or zombie flicks. After this movie is not suppose to be the next big take on Zombie movies.",1031875200,,1128,4.3254716981132075
2449346,4,B000BYRCR4,"Oh-KAY!  Resident Evil got a little more hardcore and bleak than I was prepared for, but that's a good thing.  I was expecting a mediocre, derivative action movie where I'd be able to predict every single shock and plot twist, with maybe a few cool money shots or zombie gore thrown in that made it worth a rental (I'm a sucker for zombies).  If you'd told me before I saw it that I'd be giving it 4 stars afterwards, I probably would have laughed. I ain't laughing now.
I can't compare the game to the movie that well, since I've only played the game once or twice in the arcade and didn't last very long before I got eaten. (Check the trivia section on the IMDB if you want more info on that, though beware of many spoilers) I don't know if the game has any more of a backstory than the DVD box did: a virus is accidentally unleashed at an underground biological research facility that turns all the employees, lab animals, and experiments into flesh-eating undead. A rescue team discovers too late they are stuck in there with them; they have 3 hours to get out without getting eaten or, worse, infected  before the `Red Queen' master computer permanently shuts down all the exits.
On the negative side, it was a little longer than an action movie needs to be-- 10 minutes could have been trimmed, I caught myself wanting to hit forward and skip scenes in the first half hour of people wandering warily around deserted areas. I've never wanted to do that with a Romero movie. It does take a little too long to get going, but when the action kicks in, trust me, it doesn't let up, to the point where I felt kind of battered after the movie-- really unrelenting. I couldn't stand the industrial/techno soundtrack, but then I don't usually listen to bands with song titles like `Fistf*ck"" and ""My Plague (New Abuse Mix)"". I guess it was appropriate for the movie;  I didn't exactly expect, say, Oingo Boingo (though that would have been kind of cool, now that I think of it) but it was grating after a while. Several shots were extremely derivative of Romero, but since I haven't watched the featurettes or commentaries, I'm not sure if the filmmakers intended them as a tribute/in-joke (like the newspaper headline blowing around a deserted street proclaiming THE DEAD WALK!  which, as far as I'm concerned, should earn a movie 3 stars right there) or just ripped them off with the plan to say they were `inspired by' the other movie if anyone pointed out the similarities.
The end seemed to be setting up for a sequel (according to the IMDB, one is planned but not even in pre-production), though at least not in an extremely cliched way, and it mainly irritated me because it was a cliffhanger. There's also several CGI shots where the monster looks about as realistic as the one in the actual game; I did not for a moment forget I was watching CGI, and it was VERY easy to tell where the animatronics ended and the CGI began. Oh, and terrible tagline, at least on the poster art (""Survive the horror""?  C'mon, marketing team, you can try a little harder).
OK, enough of what didn't work. On the plus side, Milla Jovovich has proven herself to be one of the few genuinely talented model-turned-actresses, and gives a great performance. I was kind of disappointed in Michelle Rodriguez's acting, mainly because she was so good in Girlfight, but she was acceptable and at least can really look like a badass. There's quite a few fun--and sick--shots. There were plot twists that I actually didn't see coming--sorry to say, I could see most of the jumps walking up 5th Avenue-- and the plot was a lot more brutal and downbeat than I expected (for a movie based on a video game, and for a modern zombie movie, anyway)--good for them. They did definitely outright steal some ideas from Dawn of the Dead (and, as everybody has already probably pointed out, Cube) but at least had some originality by putting a slightly new twist on them. There was a much higher body count than I thought (not counting all the zombie employees, of course, I mean among the heroes), most of which was pretty b-llsy. Characters did not die in the order I expected them to. Things got pretty cold-blooded (so to speak).
I'd recommend it for a rental, if you want a mindless, scary action movie with some real suspense. Big fans of the game, it's probably a good investment to purchase (though I'm sure everyone that was going to buy it did so a long time ago) . You could do a lot worse (like rent the director's Mortal Kombat, for instance) Bonus/deleted/alternate scenes, and easter eggs (yes, you can stop hunting for them now), are conspicuously absent on the DVD, which leads me to believe the talk about releasing a 2 disc set a few months down the line of an `unrated director's cut'.  I'll rent that to see that extra gore (hey, I ain't above that, and I'll gladly admit to it), and I wouldn't mind seeing the flick again, either.
Not bad at all for a mainstream studio movie based on a game.",1031875200,12,4977,4.540691192865106

I saw the trailer, it looked good to me. Milla Jovovich? Oh yeah, I remember her from ""The Fifth Element""; the girl wrapped in toilet-paper.
Resident Evil starts well. The underground laboratory known as ""The Hive"" is sealed when a deadly (sort of) virus is released. A team of S.E.A.L.s is sent in to rescue possible survivors.
How does Milla Jovovich fit in? She can't remember a thing, but she's been inside the Hive before. As the team advances through the hive, the computerised defence-system mercilessly sets out to destroy them. And that's before the zombies are unleashed!
The good part of the movie is the atmosphere. I really like the dark rooms, the beautiful scenery. And it's got plenty of GORE! And I really enjoyed this movie at the time, but I don't really feel a need to watch it again. ...",1031788800,2,977,4.49438202247191
2449348,4,B000BYRCR4,"Being a hard core Resident evil fan, I was dissappointed hearing about how the story was going to end up, but it was still a good movie. People who are not familiar with the game should love this movie even more, game fans like me though some will, and some wont. And there are only 3 monsters in the film, and the hunters are not. There are Zombies, Cereberus(the zombie dogs) and a licker (was in the 2nd RE game) which is supposed to be the major killing machine filling in for the tyrant, which is pretty lame really if your a fan of the RE game as well as the novel. I thought the special effects done on the licker where a little too computer fetched too, and it didn't even kill the victims right. According to the game the lickers had a certain way they killed their victims, which was by twisting the victims heads off with its tongue. Coulve been better gore effects as well, if anyone thinks this is the best zombie movie ever made, then you have only seen the original night of the living dead, or no other zombie movie.
The acting is good, as well as the excitement. I really cant believe Anderson didn't just read the novel, because it went by the game so well, and was made up as a story. But if he did do it that way, the film wouldve had to at least be 3 hrs. long, but it wouldve been worth it. The actors were perfect though if they still had the same characters: Milla Jovovich couldve played jill. Michelle Rodriegiez couldve played Rebecca Chambers. Eric Mabius(guy who played in the great independent film black circle boys and the crow:salvation) couldve played chris redfield, and they couldve just found other people to play Barry and Wesker.
They shouldve gone exaclty by the original story. Some fans of the re game say they wouldnt want to see the same thing over again, but that is something that would be great to see. The game Resident evil had a great story, while the movie was though original. If anyone reads the Resident Evil novel, I think they will be very angry when viewing the movie of how it turned out. But I gave it 4 stars for the entertainment, the acting, and the monsters effects. However the story couldve gone by the original and the soundtrack couldve been better. Static X and slipknot do not fit this kind of film, it isn't even real music, if you disagree then learn how to play a guitar properly. Anyway the movie is worth viewing. It was good, but could've been amazing. Hey its a really good movie, and I plan on buying it, but I say this,""Everyone play the first Resident Evil video game from beginning to end, then read the novel. If your not a fan of video games, then just read the book, and to people who don't like to read either, read it anyway, youll love it"".",1031529600,5,2726,4.357563850687622
2449349,5,B000BYRCR4,"I don't know how anyone (other than a true horror hater) cannot like this movie. I've played the game since it's first release, and once I heard Tomb Raider was coming to theater I had my fingers crossed that Resident Evil would soon follow.
  I didn't think that Tomb Raider did the game justice, but with Resident Evil the cast and crew have more than captured the feel of the game, they've taken the idea and properly put it down on film. I'm sure we all agree that is one tuff task.
  I've heard a lot of nonsense about the zombies not looking real enough and that the monsters weren't scary looking enough...Hogwash. I mean these zombies aren't the ""rotted in the ground for years"" type of zombie, their freshly killed zombies. What's a freshly killed zombie supposed to look like? Pretty much like a person that's just been killed I would guess. Anyway, the zombies were quite fitting to the plot in my view. And the monster at the end looks just like something out of the game, another good job done in my opinion.
  The computer guarding Umbrella's underground hive was a really good addition to the overall monster theme of the movie. It definitely added an interesting twist to the first parts of the film.
  If I HAD to pick out weak points of the film it would be, the hidden/secret object format the game follows. The group finds it clues/keys/guns a little too easily, but we only have a limited amount of time, so looking for a key for 30 minutes like the game would have been a tad much. And not to give any of the movie away, but I do think the dogs should have had a wee bit bigger of a part.

I like Milla Jovovich, so as far as she is on the screen, it's OK.  But the film itself is ... awful.  Not that it fails to entertain us.  It is often scary (some of the kids were jumping in the seat, it's true).  Its production designs are decent.  However, the director Paul W.S. Anderson doens't know one thing: originality.
The story is about Alice and the squad with special mission, who have to (they are told) to shut down the main computer of The Hive, underground institute specializing in the study of lethgal virus.  An accident there changes the workers (and dogs too) into zombies, and in this deadly place with booby traps, Alice in undergraund has to fight with a vengeance.
OK. ...are  As it is, fondly remembering James Cameron and David Twohy, I started to get bored after a while, the film being completely relying on shock tactics of sudden big ""Bang!"" and strongly suggested violence.
Jovovich (a bit one-note) is so-so, though lacking the presense of Jolie; Michelle Rodriguez is good, but I frankly thought they are wasting the time and the career.

These include 90% of the cast and its soundtrack.  It is a wonderful B movie and if it's a choice between this and Pearl Harbor rent Resident Evil.  I personally can't wait for the sequel",1030579200,,506,4.175257731958763
2449354,1,B000BYRCR4,"There have been rumors of a Resident Evil movie since the release of the second videogame in 1998, but it hasn't happened until now. Originally, George Romero, the director of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" wrote a script completely identicle to the story of the first videogame. Later, I discovered Romero's script had been canned and that Paul Anderson, director of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Event Horizon"" was responsible for the project. Naturally and suspectingly, this movie became another cash-in, completely ignoring the original story of Resident Evil. Even though I paid to see it in theaters on opening day, I was still sketchy about this movie. As it turned out, this movie had completely failed all my expectation, leaving me dumbfounded as to why I had even considered seeing it. This movie was another excuse to cash in on the videogame-turned-movie basis, filled with useless CG effects that have no real place in the film. The story and script is full of holes, and the one-liners get fairly annoying. As a real fan of the Resident Evil videogames, I'd recommend other die-hard gamers to only watch this movie warned that there isn't anything good to expect. But to all the movie-going public unaware of Resident Evil, enjoy this cash-in movie.",1030492800,4,1265,4.971698113207547
2449355,4,B000BYRCR4,"RESIDENT EVIL was a great Capcom videogame (with many successful versions) with a very simple plot: someone must do something in order to solve a mystery. In this basic outline, the character must cross many different spaces (each has its obstacles) and accomplish smaller missions, that help him to gather objects that lead to peaces of information leading to a final confrontation. Period.
The good thing is that the adaptation for Cinema of that basic game structure is reasonably well made. The result is this: a group of top-soldiers is sent inside a secret corporate lab complex where a lethal virus has been spread. They have a few hours to a) discover what happened, b) disable and neutralize the virus and c) get out.
Like the game, the complications rearrange the order of priorities and the journey is constantly being redesigned according to the new obstacles found. Like the game, some characters have secret agendas and everything leads to the high-powered action confrontation scene.
Put like this, it all seems cerebral, but don't missunderstand me: the film is very entertaining! If the story/screenplay design is (in this case) simple, it is because film is not for the cinemateque. It is pure (and good!) fun. It has a lot of rhythm, the cast is appealing, the characters are fine (in their game-like dimension) and the action makes you jump.
Even if you do not play the game (or even know nothing about it) you will understand it perfectly for the screenplay was designed for a wider audience. In this sense, the film is constructed so you'll get early on all the information that you need for the rest of the film.
I liked it very much and I believe this to be the best game-to-film adaptation ever made. It works even for those who did not play the game and it delivers a simple plot with lots of interesting twists and great action scenes.
The ending is begging for a sequel (but you know that already) and - I have to admit - it is a great ending (and it alone worths the whole film!). Great art direction (doesn't have much to do with the game). Good soundtrack.
The extras are fine and they're mostly on the technical side (why wouldn't they be?). Milla Jovovich is absolutely beautiful. Despite the fact that we are dealing here with game characters, I do think that Milla gives a great performance. Furthermore, I do think she is capable of taking higher flights in the future. Aside of that, she is someone the camera trully loves.

2449359,3,B000BYRCR4,"Alright, so Resident Evil has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad characterization and bad plot development. How can this possibly be any good? It's simple; you forget all the above because it's just so much fun. Of course I love zombie movies, so I could be a little biased.
Incorporating elements of the original video game into the storyline, the plot of a S.W.A.T-type team and a couple of amnesiacs stuck in a secret underground lab where genetic experiments have gone awry is for the most part intriguing and entertaining. Good enough to keep your interest for the duration of the film, at least. The development and timing of the plot needed some work; some things were revealed too late, some too soon, but the film's energy distracts you from dwelling on that too much. And except for a few clever scenes, there isn't much to admire aesthetically, but who goes to zombie movies to enjoy a piece of art?
Although it borrows too much from other genre films, such as Aliens, Cube, and George Romero's Living Dead movies, Resident Evil somehow manages to still make it work. No, it doesn't come close to the greatness of Romero's films or the gore fest of Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (a.k.a. Brain dead), but it is still much better then many other zombie flicks.
So if you're just looking for a fun zombie flick with plenty of action, Resident Evil's got what you want. It's the definition of guilty pleasure.",1030147200,,1408,4.704453441295547

However, the movie doesn't offer quite an eerie atmosphere as we've come to expect from the game, but then again this isn't the game we're talking about.  Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who brought another video game series to the big screen with the original Mortal Kombat, as well as Event Horizon) directs with his usual flair and penchant for some bloody (but not very gorey, most of the gore is kept off screen) violence.  However, the film isn't scary at all, the only thing that is  scary is how gorgeous Milla Jovovich is.  You'll know pretty much when something is going to happen, and the special effects could have been more polished, I mean you can tell that the Licker is computer generated, it doesn't even look real at all.  However, the film does have some things going for it, the original storyline (as in not taken from the game but inspired by it) is a refreshment, and the score which handled by Marilyn Manson adds the movie.

2449378,3,B000BYRCR4,"Zombies and guns. Trapped. Zombies and guns. Running. Zombies and guns... It may sound like B-grade, popcorn, adolescent male fodder, but Resident Evil is actually a well-crafted movie of the survival-horror genre. Eschewing gore in favor of imagination, it skimps on the on-screen bloodbath, and instead plays a guessing game that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.
The scenario is that in the ultra secret military lab of the Umbrella Corporation, an extremely volatile virus has been set loose. The alarm is triggered, and the Red Queen, an artificial intelligence system, quarantines ""the hive"" to prevent the virus from reaching Raccoon City, trapping the workers in the process.
In an effort to save the survivors and salvage the research, a team of commandoes is sent in to reboot the Red Queen, before she seals the Hive permanently. A simple objective, but one immediately complicated by the discovery of our protagonist, Alice, a young woman suffering from amnesia. She has no memory, but the Team Lead recognizes her as an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, so she is taken into the hive with them.
What she finds there makes her doubt that she wants her memory back.
It may sound like overdone tripe, but Resident Evil (RE) takes some of the old horror cliches and makes them new again. Alice's memory loss is handled with intelligence, and enough mystery to keep the viewer guessing. The gore is minimal, as the film culls its scares from sound cues and implication rather than onscreen blood. Unlike so many other horror movies, it doesn't have gaping holes in it's plot (though there are a couple of lapses in continuity). Instead it cleverly weaves it's elements, slowly revealing how everything came to pass as it heads towards it climax. The coup de grace though, is the action. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez put the ""grrr!"" in ""girl."" Wallflowers won't survive in the Hive, and these two ladies are intent on living. When the ammo's gone, they resort to hand to hand combat, taking a chunk out of their adversaries.
I won't recommend RE to those who are faint of heart, or abhor lots of shooting, screaming, and scares. But for those that love a good action movie, pop a bag of popcorn, and make yourself comfy on the couch. You're in for a hell of a thrill ride. And when the movie's done, check out the special features. The 2-disc Collector's Edition coming later this year will have the lion's share, but the Special Edition is no slouch. There are several ""Making of"" featurettes, a music video by Slipnot, and a commentary track featuring the principal actors and the director.

Milla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as is appropriate for an action flick. What works in the movie's favor is that it actually feels like a video game. There is atmosphere and pressure, thumping climactic music, zero character development, dialogue pared down to the essentials, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of locations, lots of zombies... all the comforts of Playstation, without having to move your thumb!

A team of military guys enter a secret facility to ""save the world"". People die, only few make it out alive.
I found the element of amnesia of one of the main charakters (Alice) interesting. Though this element has been used many times in other movies it nevertheless keeps the movie interesting, as Alice tries to find out who she is, what she did in the past and why she did it.
So what else is to say about a movie featuring a basic story that has been told many times before?
To enjoy the movie (any movie like that) you have to focus on other elements that make a movie, which mainly would be the ""how is the story told"", and I think the way this story is told is worth 2 stars. Esp. since the movie is not trying to be funny or too entertaining (which I really hate about horror movies).
If a movie intends to scare (regardless how cheap the scares are) comic relief is always misplaced.
Worth mentioning is, that the AI is not the usual [bad]-software that simply goes berzerk, or follows a plan of it's own or wants to rule the world. The AI most of the time in this movie makes sense and is simply doing what it was programmed to do.
The rest is action and suspense. Predictable sometimes, but who cares. People who want to be amused by a movie should watch comedy, not horror. People who want movies to make sense should watch the news (even that doesn't always make sense) and not action-horror-suspense movies.",1029110400,,1592,4.418367346938775

The game is based solely on action. The horror aspect was stuck in to give the genre a twist. Every Resident evil game was built around the shoot'em up concept. additionally, if anyone saw the previews before they decided to spend money on the movie would easily have known that this was a no-brainer, action flick. If you expected anything else then you shouldn't be writing reviews for anything.
 Needless to say, the movie was not the greatest movie ever made. It wasn't even close. But I can say it was fun to watch. I would like to see where they take the story to in the next movie, ""Resident Evil: Nemesis"" in the works now.",1029024000,,779,4.372413793103449

Unfortunately, you don't get much of that here either, thanks  to a razor-thin plot and alot of idea-snatching from superior films. The plot revolves around a company called the Umbrella Corporation, which does illegal viral research in an underground facility called the Hive, which in turn is monitored by an artificial intelligence component called the Red Queen.  After  a security breach, the Red Queen activates a defense mechanism in which all the Hive employees are trapped and summarily killed in the facility.  At this point a tactical unit is dispatched to investigate, and that's where the so-called fun begins.  Again, a movie like this is never known for its' character development or acting range, in which case Milla Jovovich acquits herself admirably in the lead role, looking sufficiently (hacked) off when the scene calls for it.  Michelle Rodriquez does another one of her always-looks-mad-as-hell routines, which seems to be all she's good for and is frankly getting tiresome in every movie that she's in.

I loved this movie!  Based on the video game of the same name, it gives you all the zombie killing fun that I can only assume the game does (I've never played it but I've seen commercials for it on T.V.)
In the secret underground lab of the Umbrella Corporation, illegal genetic and chemical weapons experiments are being conducted.  One of the experimental agents is released in the facility and the A.I. enhanced super-computer that monitors the lab decides that the only way to contain the ""accident"" is to lock down the building and terminate the hundreds of researchers who have been exposed.  The company then sends in a special forces team to disable the computer and discover the reason for the disaster.  Once inside the team discovers that the A.I. is in control, the researchers have all become flesh eating zombies and  the genetic experiments have broken out of their cages.
Milla Jovovich, aka Leeloo from The Fifth Element, plays Alice, a special forces agent in a sexy evening gown with short term amnesia, who is found in the house above the lab complex and taken in with the team to secure the facility.  The only other actor of name is Michelle Rodriguez (Girl Fight, The Fast and the Furious) as one of the special forces soldiers.  Both women do a great job of running around blasting zombies and acting cool.
The special effects are really good.  The zombies are your basic slow moving, ever advancing, impossible to kill without a head shot variety.  The mutated killer dogs are scary and look real, but the CGI genetic mutants are disappointing.  Kinda like the stone warriors from the based on a video game movie Tomb Raider.  The 3-D computer maps of the facility that pop up periodically to show you where the characters are is a neat effect as well.

Instead you get a bunch of incompetent special forces jerks who have no personality and seem to not think of trying a headshot when the people they shoot get back up after emptying entire magazines into them. This movie plays more like a crappy matrix remake with zombies delivering neck-breaking and kung-fu kicks galore instead of horror. Another thing there's no blood when they shoot 'em in the head just a shot of the gun going off and a quick cut to the tiny bullet hole on the forehead of the zombie; no forehead squibbs!
The best thing about this movie is Milla Jovovich gets naked. You can even tell that some of the background in the mess hall tank sequence are 2-D paintings.

I have played all of them (aside from Resident Evil Gaiden for the Gameboy Color, and Resident Evil Survivor which is just a title trying to cash-in on Sega's success with House of the Dead).  Having said that, I must warn fans to take this movie for what it is- an action movie with similar monsters and the same city.  The movie is loosely based on the game, there are no characters from the game, the mansion lab has been replaced by ""the Hive"" (a lab buried deep under Raccoon City, more in common with the 2nd and 3rd games).  So, once I turned off the RE fan boy inside and gave up on the hope that this would be a faithful representation of some of the finest games in the world, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience.  However some problems are inherent with the movie itself.  The villainous Red Queen seems to have conflicting motivations from scene to scene.  At times she seems to be merely enacting protocol, other times she seems to be playing a malevolent game with the lives of innocents.  The zombies, other than a couple instances, are uninspired.  Unlike the game where the people have had time to rot and are sufficiently dead-looking, these look merely like people that don't get out much.  The special effects are hard to believe, especially the Licker.  It doesn't look convincing, or even reasonably scary (a Hunter would have been a more suitable monster, if not several Hunters).  The fight seen between Milla and the Dogs is forgettable, and stupid.  Finally, the obligatory femme fatale SWAT team member, that takes no guff and shows no fear, is both contrived and offensive.  Otherwise, Resident Evil is an entertaining, if uninspired movie with more in common with Aliens than the game from which it recieves it's title.  I suggest you check it out.",1028678400,,1835,4.672897196261682

This movie had no gore and a female lead that could act but I like my women more voluptuous.  Story is confusing but unimportant anyway so don't worry about it.  American movies should not be censored or at least available in an uncut form because the audience for this type of movie demands it and this is the land of the free. When will these movie studios get a clue.  Movies rated for children are well and good but it's the adults that pay for them and we should be able to watch movies that cater to us too.

2449406,4,B000BYRCR4,"Lets be honest this film was never going to win any votes for an Oscar or an Emy but I think it would win votes from fans of Thriller/Horror movies and also fans of the Games. For those of you who are sitting there going Resident What? And Umbrella Who? Here is a quick run down of the plot.
Imagine a Small American Midwestern Town called Racoon City (Don't ask), its economy is good, its people are happy and enjoy living there and it has some fantastic scenery. The largest employer in the city is the Umbrella Corporation, Americas largest Medical group. Umbrella looks clean, however it also produces large orders of Biological weapons. Umbrella decided to build a secret lab called the HIVE, under Racoon City (How they did it with out anybody knowing, your guess is as good as mine), this lab is there to research the T-Virus, a medical triumph in the field of combating nerve based disease. However the Virus has an interesting side effect; it can bring people back from the dead and also turn people into the undead (NICE).
Anyhow a disgruntled employee breaks a vile of the T-Virus in the HIVE in an attempt to kill everyone, he rushes for the exit while the HIVES Megalomaniac Super Computer, the RED QUEEN, (one of the directors many associations with the Alice and in Wonderland Story) seals off the HIVE in an attempt to contain the outbreak, of course all of the employees quickly die and soon the HIVE is full of hordes of Zombies all looking for a quick snack.
Umbrella sends in the Marines to find out what went wrong and with the help of the security guard Alice (Reference), Jovovich, they soon find themselves battling the undead, shooting mutant dogs, avoiding laser beams all while trying to restore Alice's memory and find an antidote.
Queue lots of blood flying around rooms, screaming, boo scares, creatures galore and the typical statement of never go down a corridor alone especially a dark one.
The film moves along nicely and does not take its self too seriously at all, it is not afraid to show that it has borrowed form the Night, Dawn and Day of the dead series by Romero and it is because of this admittance that it works well.
The actors perform well and interact well also with the Computer FX. The Zombies do look disgusting and they are all different and they actually move like Zombies in the game and not like a stereotypical Zombie of On the Zombie FX a few points that should be worth noting are that the Zombie scenes are NOT computer generated they are actual actors, a hark back to the days of when computers where more costly than the film and the FX department only dreamed of virtual actors. The computer FX, also the make up teams were told to make the zombies look ill not dead and this is evident in the actual film.
The only let down to the effects is the licker. This creature looks great standing still, but when it starts to move it shows that the Computer FX did not do well, it looks jagged and flimsy and almost laughable, but apart from that the FX are fine.
However the DVD to say the least is Poor, the extras on it are pathetic compared to other less hyped films. The interviews with the cast and crew are too short and there are not enough of them, the trailers are old and poorly transferred, unlike the actual film, which transferred very well, and the Wide screen anamorphic - 1.85:1 looks great. The thing that could have made this DVD could have been the edition of so much more, like how about a Resident Evil mini game for DVD-ROMS, extended commentary from the director or even some stills would have been nice. An interview with CAPCOM would have gone down a treat with both fans of the movie and the game alike also how about some histories behind the Games as well. But the biggest edition to the extras that was missing was the deleted scenes. The film looks as if it has been cut a bit to try and get it in to the 100 min market and also not seem to long winded, after all there is only a certain amount you can do with Zombies, but still it would have been nice to have seen some, Christ if Disney put deleted scenes in their DVDS surely Columbia/Tri-Star can?
The saving grace is the Slipknot music video, as a fan it was great and the background pictures from the film made it even better, if your not a fan you may not even look at it but if you are then buy it just for this.
Overall a good sound film that will probably end up being shown on Christmas Night around 11:45 after the news, but hey if you're a fan see it, if your not see it anyway, but if you can wait and see if a directors cut comes out. Like the title says I think Romero would like it a lot!
I though i would put this in as i mentioned it in the review. it a small list of the references to Alice in Wonderland, although small it is interesting to see.
1. Milla Jovovich's Character is called Alice
2. Around the clock in the mansion are pictures from Alice in  Wonderland
3. The central computer is called the Red Queen.
I just thought it was interesting as the directors brief for himself was for a different view on the Alice in Wonderland story, and that puts a whole new light on the story. 5th year students studying Shakesphere forget that soon you will be analysing this movie for its deep metaphorical meaning, maybee, perhaps not.",1028678400,2,5290,4.392456676860347
2449407,5,B000BYRCR4,"Excellent movie, great soundtrack and cool effects. This movie didn't get very good reviews from the ""critics""... but who are they anyways? This movie is defiantly one to add to your Action / Science Fiction / Horror collection. For what the movie is based on and the amount of violence deemed to ""neutralize"" a Non-living hostile, there is very little gore. Even when those poor guys get Ginsued in that little hallway, it doesn't show what a mess it really would be... Instead it lets your gray matter ponder on it. This itself makes it very gruesome. The music is wonderfully placed and mixed, I never was a MM fan... I think he's the same thing Brittany Spears is to little normal preppy types that he is too little wanna-be Goths. But I have to admit, he did an excellent job with the soundtrack. The RE DVD is loaded with all kinds of stuff, which is a huge feature I love about DVDs. The only negative thing about this DVD I can say is that the Commentary is terrible. It would have been better if it was just the director, but they have the entire cast droning on and on about things that have little or nothing to do with the film.
There's a million little touches they did to make this movie cool, like when the zombie dog jumps in the air and gets shot in the head. For a split second you can see half of its head explode... very cool. There's a zombie with a broken ankle that walks around and you can hear its bones crunching as it walks around, and the very best little detail... The guy who gets sliced up into a bunch of little squares... his eye oozes just a little before he falls apart. What's not to like about RESIDENT EVIL?
Even the movie soundtrack is cool, they put a cool sample right in the beginning. Check it out.",1028678400,,1741,4.327217125382263
2449408,3,B000BYRCR4,"I wasn't expecting much when I began watching Resident Evil, so I was not so much disappointed with it. The plot is completely non-existent, the scenes just an excuse to lots of shots, punchs, kicks, etc. You know from the beginning who is the bad guy, how the end is going to be, all that. The low point of the movie is Michelle Rodriguez, from whose face we understand she's suffering severe pains in some kind of vital organ (in the real life, not in the movie). The high point is Milla Jovovich, more beautiful than ever. She is the only reason for someone to watch Resident Evil more than once. Milla is not hysteric like in ""Joan of Arc"", and not stupid like in ""The fifth element"". She is plainly gorgeous, and her almost-gone kind of voice is very atractive.
I give Resident Evil three stars: one for some of the action scenes, who were well done, and two for Milla, one for each of her lovely blue eyes.

The film is at its best when the characters come up against hordes of zombies - including a really cool homage to both Day and Dawn of the dead involving intestines. But there is absoloutely no wit to the film - it wants to take itself too seriously. And that is the biggest problem.

2449410,2,B000BYRCR4,"This one should have been ""The Night of the Living Dead"" of the new millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing, an incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast. Ironically, Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" ; perhaps the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that ""Resident Evil"" is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.
And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and [mad]at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch ""The Fast and the Furious"". It was a great pleasure seeing her changed into a zombie at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel.
It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"".
TRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly pop out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised. Another vivid proof of a half-hearted attempt to bring a popular videogame franchise to the big screen.",1028592000,3,2259,4.678391959798995

2449420,5,B000BYRCR4,"This is my first review written here, and perhaps some of you old timers might hear me out.  Resident Evil is an amazing movie, brought together from the minds of gamers and psychological nit-pickers alike.  The movie is meant to be left a bit confusing, only to add to the mystery the characters are themselves experiencing.  As said in the commentary, the characters that have suffered from slight memory loss are very helpless and vulnerable, and the audience is made to feel all the same.  ""Hot"" actresses make up the childish tang of the movie, which is meant to portray innocence and fresh-to-the-world mindsets.  Of course the mini skirt complements this, as does Michelle Rodriguez's (Rain) baggy commando uniform.  Shoulda used her knife more!
  Anyway, I must admit that I haven't liked a movie as I do this one for some time.  Event Horizon is perhaps one of my favorite films, only because of its whole eerie feeling, and Resident Evil does about double of what I would have expected off of E.H.  The director does the perfect job with this film - he makes the most important thing the ""here"" and ""now"".  Of course the characters may seem to the critics as undefined and two dimensional, but then they wouldn't be critics if they didn't have something bad to say!  The point of this background-less approach is to make the audience forget about everything else not happening at the current moment.  The characters were not given the luxury of gathering their thoughts before they were plummeted into The Hive, and once they were in, they had no need to remember how they felt about last Christmas.  This is called the mood.
 Some people associate Marilyn Manson's presence in the credits with unthinkable ways of life, and though that may be true to whatever extent, he is only there for the music.  He has put scoring into another category for me; I feel now that the difference between song writing and scoring is merely the artist.  Manson does an absolutely amazing job placing lurking sounds and treading effects over menacing bass lines and intense melodies.  Manson demanded much of himself on this job, and places into the Resident Evil world feelings and anticipations that would have otherwise not been present.  He took a scene's feel and atmosphere personally, and spent time composing tracks that did not merely fit with the set and plot, but instead meshed into the landscape right before the viewers' eyes.  If anyone wants to discuss this, download his track ""Seizure of Power"" that was written to, not for, the movie.
  Now, as some say that it is not a creditable movie to the game, one must realize that it was not based on the game's actual play.  The creators imaged the Resident Evil world, and its feelings and manners, and created something from the middle of this.  Half of the characters had no idea what was going on for most of the time, and only wished to see the commando mission achieved and their own lives saved.  More and more is explained as the movie goes on, as it should be.  The game has its own succession of events, as does the movie.  Resident Evil the game throws around different challenges and events, while the movie's producers have a line that follows the best of these.  The game is meant to be interacted with, as the movie is meant to be experienced.  Those who have played the games already know what will happen in order to succeed, anyway...  Why just act that out?
 The producers did slip in a few places, but they did their best with their budget.  The most obvious mistake is the note reading something about ""today all your dreams will come true"".  It's shown twice in the movie, though in different handwritings!  During the commentary, they even admit to it!  Ah well; no harm done.  Again, they were given a very limited budget, and they did their best using what they had.  A pretty funny point was in their admitting that most of the large doors in the movie were in fact the same one, just painted every time!  Smart!  Again, the characters were left short and thin because that was the entire point.  We do not get enough to anticipate their actions, which leave even more to be expected.  The character ""Alice"" even spends a few moments here and there remembering her own skills, which were taught to her as an inner company operative, though she doesn't realize it.  The dog scene mainly brings these qualities to the surface, and I can't complain about watching her easily drop kick both zombie and un-dead poochie alike.  The firearm usage right after reveals even more to her character, though perhaps it revealed more to her than the audience.  Also, she definitely does not come out of the movie just as pristine as she had entered it; she did all of her own stunts, and all of the bruises and scratches that were on her at the end of the movie were real.  In fact, they had to add a little make-up to improve her appearance for different scenes!  Lastly on this note, why would any company reliant on an underground research lab construct the lab's controlling computer to be accessible from the outside of the complex.  Matter of fact, it's the same reason why I have a firewall on my computer!  How is this something wrong with the movie, as some say?
 Overall, I can't see this movie enough.  I think it amazing that the director and producer could have worked out a totally workable situation for the actors to be stuck in, and forced to find their way out of!  The sequel will bring more of a story to the Umbrella Company, as well.  ""Alice"" has already spent a good time slaying the un-dead, and next will look into just what went wrong, and what can be done to fix it.  Of course, I anticipate a good amount of trouble to present itself, but then, what would a good movie be without a little difficulty?  ...",1028505600,,5800,4.6123046875

The entire first 45 minutes were the most boring 45 minutes of any movie. it gets better, but the zombies aren't scary at all and it just needs more suspense. the entire movie was a sinch to predict.

Now, while this is a very fun movie to watch, you can't help but notice the plot holes and imperfections that cause this movie to get only 3and a half stars from me. Again, don't get me wrong, I like the movie for what it is...action, action and more action. There is some great stylish violence in the film, some outstanding visual effects and make-up and decent acting from a reasonable cast. Milla Jovovich is very good in the film (although I must admit, I am kind of partial to her) and Michelle Rodrigues is another standout, However, the supporting cast was a little weak and I think they could have done a better job in that department.
The story of the film basically follows the game, but strays a little here and there. One of my favorite parts of the film is the ""red queen"" She is very interesting and well thought out. Overall, the movie is very entertaining and I enjoyed watching it, but I just can't bring myself to give it more than three and a half stars due to the plot holes and sub-par supporting cast.
The dvd is good. The menus look nice and the picture looks vivid and clear. The audio is also good. My only complaint is the extras, a little sub-par. The commentary track is nice, but there are no deleted scenes, outtakes or alternate scenes or endings. There are some featurettes, but they are a waste of time.

2449427,5,B000BYRCR4,"Okay, here's some facts about the movie before I start this review.
Fact:  Yes, this movie isn't too close to the storylines in the ""Resident Evil"" games.  I've played a couple of them, but not much to know the storylines.
Another Fact:  This movie SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME SO BAD!  And I don't scare easliy when it comes to horror movies.
I happened to love everything about ""Resident Evil.""  I was a little worried at first, because we all know track records of movies based on video games.  They're not that good.  So, I was going into this movie with some kind of hope, but I was worried.  Well, I ended up enjoying EVERY MINUTE of the movie.  It was so good and so scary.  It was dark, twisted, and sinister.
Though the movie does tend to seperate itself from the orignal video game some, the basic elements are still the same.  Zombies, killer dogs, mutant killers, and a nasty virus that can destroy mankind as we know it.
The story:  The Umbrella Corporation is a very wealthy business.  It sells household products everywhere.  But what the public doesn't know is that it makes most of its money off of human experimentaion and biological weapons.  One day....something goes wrong.  Very wrong.  That's all you need to know.  There's a bunch of twists and turns this movie takes that I am not going to give away.  But let me say this....this movie has one hell of a dark and twisted ending that really made the movie that much better.
The DVD looks and sounds incredible.  Too bad that there isn't a DTS option available, but they might release this in Superbit.  But it looked and sounded awesome.  It also has some nice extra features.  Not a lot, but enough to keep you happy.
(Note:  If you're wondering why they didn't load this DVD with extras, it's probably because of all the negative feedback this movie got and how little it made in the box office.  So don't complain about it and accept it.  How in the world do you expect them to put a lot of money on the DVD when it did so poorly at the theatres?)
All in all, this movie was fantastic, and I loved every minute of it.  Let it be known, if you are a die hard fan of the video game, then maybe you should pass on this one.  Because you might be disappointed.  Then again, I read some of the other reviews from people who are fans of the game and enjoyed the movie.  If you are looking for a really good scary zombie movie, instead of these stupid teen-slasher flicks that have been coming out, see ""Resident Evil.""  If this doesn't sound like anything you'd like, maybe you'd be better off with seeing ""Jason X"" or the latest ""Halloween"" movie.  This was an awesome movie that scared the hell out of me.  I loved every second.
(Favorite scene in the movie:  When they are trying to shut the power down, the Red Queen is telling them it would be a mistake.  As soon as they're about to cut the power, she turns her head, looks at them, and says, ""You're all going to die down here.""  Creepy and awesome!)",1028332800,2,2975,4.364963503649635

Anybody can say their thirst for zombies was fulfilled as I have never seen so many on a screen since Night of the Living Dead. Also, the movie is very suspensful and there a few slow instances. There were some jumpy times but I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie...(its more action).  This movie is a lot of fun and a good rent but I probably would not buy it.

This movie just lacks ""something.""  You can't really put your finger on it but overall it's great eye candy.  Great special effects, awesome sound and for once, a good plot!  The biggest problem here though is, for a video game turned movie, this DVD sure lacks quite a bit of inspiration!  Where's the deleted scenes?  Where's the ""fun"" extras??  Where's the fun???  All are missing unfortunately.  So, I guess we'll have to wait for the real deal when Blade 2 comes to DVD in September.  In the meantime, this DVD is worth a rental.

2449451,1,B000BYRCR4,"This film was, I'm sorry, [really bad]. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.
Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theatre, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.",1028332800,2,1010,4.554945054945055

But as an action movie, it's up there with the best of the I've-got-some-time-to-kill-and-feel-like-watching-some-action-movie genre.  That's the situation I was under when I watched this movie.  Must say, I was thoroughly enjoying this movie.  Didn't really care that the plot was thin.  Didn't give a damn I didn't see any recognizable characters from the game (which I've played).  I saw a damn good action movie!

2449453,4,B000BYRCR4,"Unless you're a gaming freak who's played Resident Evil 24/7 and watched this film expecting every single detail to match up to the game, I find it hard to believe how anyone could not find this film at the very least thoroughly entertaining. The story which is pretty simple goes like this. An underground research facility has been experimenting with DNA and doing dangerous and illegal testing on animals. The facility which is run by a computer shuts down and traps all of the employees inside and a virus breaks loose killing everyone instantly. Flash forward to Alice (played by Milla Jovovich) who wakes up alone in a mansion only to discover she has no clue who she or anyone else is. An army like swat team (including Michelle Rodriguez) breaks into the mansion, informs her that she used to be one of them and forces her and a mysterious man named Matt (played by Eric Mabius) to come along to inspect what's gone on in the lab. Soon they find themselves dying one by one and fighting for survival against zombies, mutant animals and monsters. This is one of those films you have to over look it's premise and watch with an open mind, but in the end what you get is a rewarding kick ...action / horror film with some amazing special effects and some sufficiant scares. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who desires some good thrills and lots of detailed gore. Similar to the video game, this movie is not to be watched alone and is filmed with many of the storylines and scenes taken from this game. I suggest watching this DVD twice. First watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is and then watch it with the hilarious commentary on provided by the film makers, Milla and Michelle who give alot of behind the scenes info about the frame to frame sequences they shot that were taken from the game. Also discussed is their time spent in Germany while making the film, the training that went into the fighting sequences and what to expect from the highly anticipated sequel. ... With a great score by Marilyn Manson this loud, in your face flick is possibly the best movie made from a video game ever. Alot better than Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. For those who didn't like it, give it a second chance and watch it with an open mind.",1028246400,3,2245,4.504901960784314

Both hot and tons of attitude, not to mention the resemblance between the charecters in the film and game.  It's pure eye candy for all your desires.  I loved it.",1028246400,,327,4.872727272727273
2449456,4,B000BYRCR4,"For anyone who has the strategy guide to the new GameCube edition of the original Resident Evil game, you'll find that the development team of RE has called this movie a good ""trailer"" (whatever that means) and that Milla Jovovich did a good job with it. This leads me to believe that Capcom isn't overly happy with the end result. Who cares...it's solid in it's own right and doesn't pretend to be the game, but rest assured it is well based upon the concept of the game franchise, maybe more in spirit than actual application and a welcome addition.
Of the horror films that have come out in recent years, excluding Hollywood smashes such as ""The Sixth Sense,"" or ""The Others,"" and so on. ""Resident Evil"" happens to be the best, more intelligent than ""Jason X,"" and the last 2 ""Alien"" movies.
The movie begins with a very familiar concept to the hardcore RE gamers. The breakout of the virus, S.T.A.R.S. team infiltration, and so on. I don't feel the need to rewrite the synopsis of the movie, which you can get from the Official movie website and Amazon's own review. What I am going to say is that there's plenty of action, gore, mutated zombies, zombie-dogs and so on. Milla Jovovich will keep keep you enthralled herself, I guess that's reason enough for men to see it, ya? The ""Red Queen"" is the eeriest thing in the movie, ""You're all going to die here."" Not an original line, but the visual and tone of her/it is quite enough to give you the chills. I recommend watching the movie to find out what the ""Red Queen"" is. To me that was a reason to stay in my seat and be thankful that there were other people in the theater. The DVD is a hit, sharp, crisp, and chillingly Gothic. All the things I love.
I gave it 4 stars because I wanted a game controller. No I didn't, believed that didn't you? The reason I left one star of is because the movie is shorter than what it could be, even though it doesn't appear that way when watching it. All thing's being equal, well that's a crock line, but who cares, ya? If you're a horror fanatic, or like the occasional, twisted and demented scare, this one's a good choice. <P...",1028246400,,2125,4.423469387755102
2449467,3,B000BYRCR4,"The movie itself was overall enjoyable.  It had terrific special effects, but yet the whole movie was not special effects.  Some of the zombies did have to go on the blue screen, because they couldn't just do that with make-up.  You will understand when you see the movies.  The bad thing about this movie, is the plot, and that the zombies are really the star of the show, not the licker, and not the main character.  The plot was almost laughable, it had nothing to do with RE games, but I'm sure that the ""movie makers"" had good reason for this.  The characters weren't developed, I only really felt sorry for Michelle Rodriguez, she was the star of the show.  She was ""hot"" in many scenes with her tom-boyish approach in the movie.  She was the only one the cracked any jokes in this movie.  Milla Jovovich was good, she looked reallll good in clothing that barely covered her.  Thats one reason why I saw the movie.  The licker look just like the game, but the special effects that used to create some part of the licker, except the train scene, were again, laughable.  It looked like the licker was put together in a minute.  I hope they do the RE series justice in the sequel.  As I said before, this movie is for you if you like blood, gore, women in skimpy clothing (Alice), and things lurking around the corners.  The zombies really made this movie bearable to watch, and Milla a.k.a. Alice.",1028246400,2,1401,4.460629921259843
2449468,4,B000BYRCR4,"First of all, let me say that I had a preconceived opinion about this movie before I saw it.  Being a hardcore fan, I thought it would go the way of Super Mario Bros.  Much to my surprise, however, the movie turned out to be less a cold attempt to make quick cash then a proper tribute by real fans, as well as a fun ride.  Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a woman who is suddenly sucked into a mission to infiltrate an underground lab called the Hive, which has mysteriously killed its inhabitants.  Unknown to Alice, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of the crew, everyone down there is now a flesh-craving zombie.  It's not deep entertainment, but it's fun as anything.  Just rating the movie, I'd have to give it five stars, for a movie which gives a fan like me everything he wants (including Milla in minimal garb, but I digress).
My rating takes its one star plunge when the DVD itself is analyzed.  Most of the extras are just fine.  The French students among us can listen to it dubbed or subbed in Francais.  You can watch it in widescreen, and you can check out the filmographies of five members of the staff.  It also contains a music video for ""My Plague"" by Slipknot.  I wasn't interested in this video, but that's just because I'm not a fan of Slipknot.  It's all about taste in that department.  The trailer section, however, pulls my least favorite of tricks.  Instead of offering the many different tv spots, teasers, and trailers, it offers you one trailer for ""RE"" and four more trailers of random other movies.  But this is just a pet peeve.
The real clincher for me that decided its three star rating was the commentary.  It presents the situation of four (the most I've ever heard) people in a room: Milla, Michelle, producer Jeremy Bolt, and director Paul W.S. Anderson.  Because of this turmoil, the commentary plays like having four people behind you at the theater: three film students, and their ditzy blonde friend, with Milla playing the part of the latter.  I loved her as Leeloo, and I think she's an accomplished and attractive actress, but damn, is she annoying.  The commentary rarely answers any questions that the viewer might have about the film, and when the director or producer is about to, Milla typically interrupts to talk about her topless scene, or something else trivial.
On the lighter side, the commentary does provide some fun moments.  It becomes clear after twenty minutes that all four are devoted to the video game series, and Michelle sounds like a die-hard fan of my own caliber, spouting reference after reference.  Also, it's kind of funny when they go off on tangents.  There's a hilarious moment when Milla and Michelle are arguing about one aspect of the movie, while at the same time, Paul and Jeremy argue about the music of the film.  It's obvious that they don't take the commentary too seriously, and they apologize for it routinely, and inform you that the real answers will be given in the production designer's commentary.  Unfortunately, this commentary doesn't exist.
All in all, I gave the DVD 3 stars, and the movie 5, which obviously averaged out to 4.  If you want a good horror or sci-fi flick, or are a big fan of the video game series, this DVD is just right for you, and it's not too expensive either.  Otherwise, you might want to just stick with a rental.",1028160000,2,3337,4.613559322033899
2449469,5,B000BYRCR4,"OK. I know that Resident Evil had barely any gore. And people are saying that it should have had more. But I think becasue of thr lack of gore it made it better.

Resident Evil is about a team od paramiltary commandos must battle flesh-eating undead, killer dogs, and a supercomputers deadly defenses before an unleashed virus cunsumes humanity. I think this movie is a good adaptation of the video game series. It has action, violence, language, brief nudity, and some blood. I heard a rumor that the director had to cut some scenes from the movie becuase they contained so mmuch gore, that the movie would have gotten a NC-17 rating. I had also heard that there was going to be a directors cut, but I bought the movie the 2nd day it came out and i did hear of any directors cut. Maybe it will come out in the future.

If that just happens to be something your into - more power to you! But if not, you might want to make this one a rental. Aside from the zombies, the story keeps you interested, it moves along quickly, the special effects are good, and it gives a nice sequel suggestion at the end.",1028160000,,523,4.634408602150538

Even though the plot is based on a video game, it is still solid, and believable. Another selling point is all the bonus features that the DVD has. With movie comments by Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez, several featurettes, and a Slipknot music video, the DVD provides hours of entertainment, and behind the scenes insight.

2449472,4,B000BYRCR4,"The Good:
1) Good looking sets.  Because of budget constraints they filmed many scenes on/in existing locations.  This worked in their favor.
2) Fairly fast paced.  You are put in a bad situation that just keeps getting worse.
3) The movie is actually 3 stars but I gave an extra star just for the director/cast voice over commentary option on the DVD.  Watch it once without it then switch it on and watch it again. Very, very funny.
The Bad:
1) They didn't go far enough.  The movie has much less gore than you would have thought a movie like this would have.  The director said that any more and they might have gotten an NC-17 rating but I suspect they didn't have the money to do any more since I have seen many other movies that were more graphic that still got the R rating.
2) Don't go into this thinking its a ""Zombie"" movie or that its particularly scary.  Its not.  Yes it has Zombies in it but its still not that type of movie.  Its more of an action/sci-fi movie.
The Ugly:
All in all just switch off your brain and enjoy.  Don't try to put it in the same league as an Oscar contender.  Just relax and watch.  Not everything has to be A Beautiful Mind.",1028160000,,1165,4.245454545454545

From the previews, it look as if there were barely any zombies and most of the monsters were the zombie dogs, a computerized girl, or Nemesis.  After viewing the trailer, I was dissapointed b/c, quite frankly, the zombies are the scariest part.  I am glad to say that I was pleasantly suprised.  The movie was great, the acting was wonderful, and there were more zombies than I could shake an machine gun at.  I went with my wife to see this and I swear, she spent most of the movie with her head buried in my arm, and she doesnt scare easily.  The only downside to the movie was that the beginning was a bit confusing, but it all makes since as time goes on.  If you like to be scared and on the edge of your seat, this movie is for you.  But don't go into it comparing it to the video game, because as you have probably already read, its not like the game.

As pure enjoyable trash, this movie is to savored over many times.  While I cringe at buying from Sony (because a Superbit DVD will likely follow), I was pleased with the picture and sound.  I hoped that there was an uncut version out there (it SHOULD have a rated X for violence version), but no deleated scenes were included, so I am unsure.

2449486,4,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil is one of those films that I said, ""Ah, I'll wait until it gets to video to see it.""  I didn't expect it to be any good - not really.  How could it be?  It is based on a video game.  Now, I actually liked Mortal Kombat, which is also based on a video game (it wasn't great, but it was fun) - and I didn't know that the same director was responsible for it.  So, I was expecting the worst.  I was wrong.
As someone completely unfamiliar with the video game on which the film is based, I didn't know what to expect.  In short, Resident Evil is about a group of ""security"" personnel who work for a huge conglomerate that is doing all sorts of research - some of it suspect.  One of their more sinister viruses is released and they must go into the secret facility where it is created to try to fix things.  Little do they know that they will be facing all sorts of creepy security devices and ... zombies.
Milla Jovovich is the female lead and she manages to carry the film well.  I'm really not that informed on her background, but I will say that while she probably doesn't have a great depth of talent at her disposal, she is a capable actress and I liked her in her role.  To say that she was believable would be impossible, as I don't know that such a person could exist (how many zombie fighters do you know?).
Sadly, the men in this film are almost interchangeable.  I really didn't know who was who until names started getting fired off and I actually bothered to pay attention.  They all sort of look the same.  There are two other women in the film too, and I didn't realize it until one of them gets injured - they look the same as well.
The interesting thing in this sci-fi/horror film is that the horror aspects were not the ones I found frightening.  It was the sci-fi stuff.  The whole zombie aspect seems to be ground better covered by George Romero in Dawn of the Dead.  In fact, the zombie mythos seems to be taken directly from Romero's film:  they move slowly, they look terrible, and they eat flesh of the living.  If you get bitten, scratched, etc. by one of the undead, you, too, will become one of the undead.
The sci-fi angle worked better for me (and I don't really like sci-fi).  I found the security devices and the assorted set pieces to be very intimidating and frightening.  I definitely was feeling the suspense.
Part of the fun for me was that I DIDN'T know about the video game.  Why? I didn't know what was going on.  The beginning of the film was very confusing as I didn't understand what was happening or why it was happening.  Fortunately, the screenwriters did a very good job of having a few of the characters actually explain the subject to me - and it was done well - as a few of the other characters were designed to be as confused as I was.
The script, the sets, the make-up, and the actors made this a very enjoyably scary film.  I actually recommend it and give it four stars when compared with other films of this genre.
The DVD extra features are rather standard and I didn't avail myself of all of them.  However, as DVD extras become the norm, I think we'll see more and more added features for big budget films and more of the ""standard fare"" extras, such as these, offered:  Director and actor commentary, subtitles, music video, biographies of the actors, etc.
Have yourself a good scare and watch this film.",1028073600,,3373,4.321144674085851
2449487,4,B000BYRCR4,"A Zombie film with no gore?...surely not!!
However, it almost works...almost. Paul Andersons not done too bad a job with it considering i thought they were gonna turn it into a pg13 when Romero left the production, but far too many movies have been pillaged in it (Matrix, Dawn of the Dead, Aliens, Cube) so if you seen any of these films youll be seeing the same thing but in a slightly different way.  Acting is occasionally dodgy but bearable.  Overall a good film, if you're a fan of RE of course.  Sequel should be better.",1028073600,,527,4.46875
2449488,5,B000BYRCR4,"So there are a lot of you who are very critical of this movie. That it wasn't an accurate portrail of (in my opinion) the greatest video game series ever, sans Final Fantasy. I throughly enjoyed this movie. It has a great premise, even though it's not based directly on one of the games. But I believe that Paul W.S. Anderson did an amazing job on this movie. The casting was outstanding, to say the least. You can't ask for anything more than for an actor to truly love what they are doing, and both the amazing Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez love the game. One of the greatest things about this DVD is the commentery by Anderson, Jovovich, Rodriguez, and Bolt. I've watched it about 5 times already. I truly hope there is a sequel to this movie because I really loved it and I'm looking forward to seeing how Anderson incorporates the characters from this film with the characters from the actual game.

2449489,4,B000BYRCR4,"It's so refreshing to see a horror movie that actually takes itself seriously. I'm old enough to remember when scary movies actually believed they could frighten you and not show their insecurities through self-parody. The closest movie I can remember to this one is Aliens by James Cameron, in which the action takes turns with fear.
Of course, this movie is based on the video-game series which I know only by reputation. Probably one of the reasons behind the movie is a marketing one, which works, because now I want to play the game.
In the world of Resident Evil, the world's largest corporation is secretly conducting genetic experiments and developing biological weapons. A problem develops when one of these biological weapons, called the T-virus, is released in one of the company's underground labs. The lab, called The Hive, is controlled by a super computer called The Red Queen. She kills all the employees in one manner or another in order to contain the virus. A team of paramilitary soldiers is sent in to shut her down, not knowing that they will release zombies who have a taste for living flesh. Milla Javovich plays a soldier who guards the entrance to The Hive, and due to her proximity to the lab, was knocked out by nerve gas, and has lost her memory.
I really liked this movie. It reminds me very much of the George Romero movies, but with more style and more of a budget. There are a lot of frightening moments. You don't ever get a tongue-in-cheek comment or a moment of goofiness that you see in Wes Craven movies. In fact, what horror director can you name these days besides him? It's pretty sad about the poor lack of quality AND quantity in horror. Witness the idiocy of the new Halloween movie, or Jason X. They would make Ed Wood roll in his grave. Resident Evil is grim, gruesome, bloody, apocalyptic, sad, brutal, entertaining, and invigorating. The look of it is  beautiful, lots of greys, blacks, and whites, with Milla's red dress of blood flashing through it all.
The director, Paul W.S. Anderson, has really outdone himself with this film. It moves and pulses and oozes, and creeps around you. This is greatly helped by the soundtrack recorded by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. I really liked the Alice in Wonderland references. That's how you feel, as though you're in the land of the videogame, where only it has any reality. Anderson shows us what John Carpenter or George Romero could have become instead of sinking into obscurity and B-movies.
Now, for the DVD quality. The picture is beautiful and the menacing ambience of keyboards and guitar is really good. It features 5 short featurettes: ""The Making of Resident Evil"", ""Scoring"", ""Costumes"", ""set Design"", and ""Zombie Make-up Tests"". The making of the score is interesting because we find out that Marilyn Manson is actually a pretty intelligent guy.....uh, girl.....uh whatever. It also includes a video from the Black Sabbath/Texas Chainsaw Massacre band Slipknot, if that means anything to you.
Something pretty disappointing about the DVD is the movie commentary. It features Milla Javovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Producer Jeremy Bolt, and Paul Anderson. It's disappointing because everytime the two filmmakers start to discuss something interesting in the movie, Milla comes in and interjects ""nobody cares about that"" or ""that's not very interesting"" and goes into some rambling that has nothing to do with the film. In fact, at the beginning, it seems as if Milla doesn't even know what a commentary is: ""you mean we're going to comment on the whole movie?"" She comes across as an immature valley girl. You can always just never listen to it.

This movie just doesn't stop, and is by far the best ""zombie film"" I have seen.  The acting is mediocre (not bad, mind you) and the characters work in the context of the film. The music is very well done, the general theme of which is borrowed heavily from the George A. Romero films.
Not being a fan of the game is irrelevant (I wasn't, but this film has gotten me hooked), you'll still enjoy it if you have any love of the sci-fi/action genre.
This film is what it is...a rollercoaster, so turn your brain off and don't overanalyze it! Enjoy the ride!",1027987200,3,875,4.49685534591195
2449493,3,B000BYRCR4,"This movie starts off slow, but take heart...it takes off in a whirlwind of action.  A group of scientists, working in a secret installation known only as ""The Hive"", play God, experimenting on DNA and creating a mutating virus.  When an attempt is made to steal the virus, the thief unleashes the virus.  The Hive's security defenses, in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading, seals off the facility, killing all within.  A special military unit is sent to discover the reason behind the deaths at the facility, and to shut down the ""murderous"" main computer controlling the security defenses within the hive.  What they don't know is that the virus that was unleashed mutates the dead into nightmarish zombies.
Although the action is slow in coming, when it hits you're in for a rollercoster ride!  The movie is very true to the game.  The  zombies move exactly like those in the game, even when they are being shot.  Milla Jovovich is every bit the action heroine.  At the beginning of the movie she appears to be a helpless damsel in distress, but we soon learn that she's anything but.  And there are even some genuine surprises in the end.
My only gripe with the movie is that it reminds me all too much of Aliens.  A slow start, followed by extreme action and bloody deaths, a strong female lead.  Even the military unit reminds me of the Marines in Aliens.  The character played by Michelle Rodriguez is reminiscent of Vazquez from Aliens.  And the plot twist is also similar.  However, all-in-all this was a pretty decent movie inspired by a great video game.",1027900800,,1577,4.68
2449494,3,B000BYRCR4,"Some fans of the Resident Evil video game complained that the film was not true to the game; I have never played the game, so I can't comment on that, but in a sense such a criticism is neither here nor there. It's more important to know that Resident Evil is as much an homage to George Romero films as it is to its video game origins, although I am sure many tried and true Romero fans won't like Resident Evil for its somewhat poor and certainly imitative borrowing of Romero's zombie ideas. Resident Evil doesn't stop there, as it borrows from other sci-fi and horror films; the method the Red Queen uses to kill several characters trapped in a corridor is lifted right out of the low-budget, cult favorite (and successfully eerie) film Cube. Paul Anderson is a talented filmmaker, to be sure, and Resident Evil is a slick looking film with sparkling clear photography. Anderson's screenplay isn't as simplistic as one might expect from this type of movie and it proceeds through a series of flashbacks to tell part of it story. Milla Jovovich, whose energy, presence, and looks always out-pace her acting, is just the type of actress to play Alice. Add to that the nice touch of giving the Red Queen the voice of a young British girl, and you have a film that rises above mediocrity ... even if it never really impresses.
It doesn't help this film that zombie movies in general are difficult to take seriously these days, unless the zombies are tounge-in-cheek. But Resident Evil is fun and slightly scary. Just remember that this is derivative, not original, filmmaking and that you too can own this DVD for less than full price. That would be the justification for actually owning it.",1027900800,6,1691,4.65886287625418

This was a playfully nasty little bit of fun, meant to give you a little thrill, and a few smiles, too.
Maybe I was in just the right mood when I saw this in the theatres, or maybe I'm more forgiving than other folks, (yeah, right), but I liked RE for what it is;

2449506,5,B000BYRCR4,"I Saw Resident Evil the movie in Mexico on the Omni screen with THX sound at 6 floors high and wide its was amazing. now the DVD is here and the movie is a perfect transfer from Cine to DVD. the game to movie transfer was delt with good enough new carictors, new house on the other side of the forist, the train sequence wasdelt with good too as in the second game you see the train leave and there was an endless tunnel behined it so there is where the train comes from the new house. The Hive is the same from the seconed but in the game you could only make it a serten size due to computer memory and time and probably more reasons but on film you can show the full size. The house is an Emergancy Escape house to recive high class personel and to evacuate them. The house also functions as Emergency Entrance to the Hive in case's where fast entrance is needed. In all it was good to see the movie after a 6-7 year weight from one director to an other etc... . The FX were top class, The Sound was done well, The Music was done well, and the Actores were good. The next thing to weight for is the Directors Cut in witch i will sertenly get as well. A definet 5 Stars Movie as is and with the next version the Directors Cut in 4-5 months that would probably be a 10 stars film.",1027814400,,1280,4.023529411764706

The special effects and the plot behind it was just f'in awesome. Again, i don't know why people put this movie down for not being more like the game, it wasn't supposed to be, it was supposed to be a Prequel to the game and it is a very nice one. The movie left alot of room for a sequel which I surely hope comes out soon as I cant wait for it. Welp, there's my two cents :) Hope it helps :D",1027814400,,759,3.75

2449509,5,B000BYRCR4,"This was one the few movies in a long while that I enjoyed more than a *little* bit.  I think the people who went into the movie with a ""Oh, brother"" expectation got what they were expecting.  But I personally thought it created a great spooky mood with mesmerizing shots early in the movie that could've come straight from a Stanley Kubrik flick (The Shining, 2001 A Space Odyssey).
The production value is a bit odd at times.  Some parts look like they spent a ton of money but then others look like they were seriously rushed.  Did you guys keep seeing the Microphone Boon about 20 times in this movie too?
The earlier posts about wanting more gore are a bit disturbing.  WTH?  There's *Plenty* of gore in this movie.  If you didn't think so, I suggest a seriously overdue reality check.  I do admit the Zombie crowd scenes didn't quite work but overall, the storyline is good (yeah some of the smaller details seem overlooked / left out).
Milla Jovovich of course looks fine (though kinda grungy) and is a surprisingly good actress.  Although how many people are going to admit that when it's in the context of a movie based on a video game?  She's already shown what she could do in the fifth Element so it really shouldn't come as a surprise but she's definitely proven here that she's more than just a pretty face.
The movie definitely evokes the same mood that the Original Night of the Living Dead did.  ""It's us versus them and we gotta get outta here.""  A Definite recommend.",1027728000,,1486,4.503731343283582

In a dark theatre I sat with my entire body embroiled in shivers, the slightest sound behind me sent shockwaves of icy fear through me and it took over an hour after the movie for that fight or flight response to die down.

The visuals were some of the best to date.  The zombies looked awesome.  I cannot wait for the DVD to come out!

2449512,3,B000BYRCR4,"Being a fan of the ever-popular Resident Evil video game for both Playstation and Gamecube, I found the movie to be somewhat of a disappointment in that aspect, however for a movie alone it does an average job. The actors do their best to interact with the obviously bland and remarkably unoriginal plot, and the special effects make for some excellent scenes.
The movie is cohesive in the respect that I saw how the writers didn't make the fatal mistake of taking the famous game plot and drive it into a movie, they used the names of a few key events and objects (Umbrella, T-Virus, Raccoon City) and rebuilt the movie to fit into two hours of action that didn't require puzzle solving and boring backtracking (though you see in the movie less than thirty different scenes I think!)
The movie is a good fling for some entertainment (but if your a gamer, don't expect Jill or Chris to blow anything away!) The movie made its mark as yet another video game-movie transfer and it ranks, like its previous attempts, mediocre. I think that the game to movie idea needs some more time to develop, after all the average video game lasts three to sixty hours now, so movies are a bit pressed for a descant transfer!",1027382400,,1209,4.576036866359447

While it isn't overly scary, they do a great job on make-up with the zombies.  The plot is very easy to follow and keeps you on the edge of yours seat the whole time.  There are some great performances by the 2 lead roles, and the movie keeps a mysterious, dark undertone throughout the movie like is felt in the video game.  If you enjoy the video game you are going to love this movie, although it is hardly even loosely based on the video game.  But since this is coming out to video soon, this is a great movie to rent and have fun with.

2449515,5,B000BYRCR4,"These days, when we hear about video games being adapted to the big screen, all fans of said video game begin to weep and complain.  And I can't blame them.  Just look at the other Video Game-Movies out there:  ""Street Fighter"", ""Super Mario Bros."", ""Mortal Kombat""(1&2), and ""Tomb Raider"".  None are very good at all.  As a matter of fact, they all [stink].  So when I heard news of ""Resident Evil"" taking the doomed trip, I was kind of [ticked] off in a sense.  Then, I heard Milla Jovovich, and Michelle Rodriguez, two very gorgeous women, were starring in it.  This got me a little excited, but then I asked myself:  ""Remember how hot Angelina Jolie is, and look at 'Tomb Raider'"".  So it rolled around in theaters, and I went to it as an alternative to ""Blade II"", which was beyond sold out.
I was blown away, to say the least.  I loved how Paul Anderson didn't use a whole lot CGI, and how he gave a fairly thorough explanation of what made the zombies, well, zombies.  Not many other zombie movies give explanations.  Just take the Romero flicks as an example.  But altogether, this isn't exactly a zombie-fest.  It balances the horror with wit, like the video game did before it.  It also transfers a lot of the video game into the movie, such as the mansion, certain names(Nemesis), a few tricky angles, and creatures(the dogs and Lickers).  This altogether makes a pretty darn cool movie.  I also really enjoyed how he brought the zombies to the screen.  He gave them poor skin, and made them barely decomposed.  I prefer that over entirely decomposed bodies.  It scares the viewer a bit more, because we can still see the human side of the zombie poking through.  The best zombies on-screen to date.  Not a great film by any means, but definitely one of the coolest movies I've ever seen.  Not to mention the first time I saw it, I jumped a good 5 times.  Upon second viewing, I still jumped twice.
Onto the features.  The Slipknot video is just that, nothing great unless you're a huge fan of the band.  The featurettes are cool.  The making of is the best by far, and the ""Scoring Resident Evil"" was extremely interesting, considering the score in the movie was great.  Other than that, the make-up tests, and costume trials weren't spectacular, rather short, but still fun.  The highight on this disc in the Commentary track.  On the track is the director, Paul Anderson, Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and the producer(the name escapes my mind right now).  They're all very comfortable with eachother, and crack wise quite often.  They talk about an upcoming sequel, which excites me, but I'm curious as to how they'd bring back Rain(hopefully they will!).  The only thing is that it was recorded before the film was released theatrically, so I wonder if the box office gross will affect the sequel?
Overall, the disc is about a 4.5, and the movie, a 5.  It's not the best acting around, it's not gonna give anybody nightmares, but it's guaranteed to make you jump.  And if you enjoyed the video game, you'll love the movie.  Take it from a fan of the game.  So, go out and rent it or buy it.  Just make sure you see it, and enjoy all the horrifying goodness!",1027382400,4,3179,4.569148936170213

2449522,3,B000BYRCR4,"I think that anyone who went to see 'Resident Evil' expecting character development or a witty script are foolish.  This is the kind of no-brainer entertainment that is good fun at the cinema and from this perspective it is actually pretty good.  The story has Jovovich playing a...babe with memory loss who, along with a group of army officers infiltrate an underground research facility called The Hive.  Unknown to the public above this is where the hugely influential Umbrella Corporation has been researching the deadly T-Virus, that reanimates the dead.  However, the Red Queen computer mainframe killed all of the Hive's employees after a security scare.  Now it's up to the cast to find out what went on there.
First of all I'll go through everything that's wrong with this movie.  Most glaringly, there are several long scenes which just have the cast shooting at zombies, which I could have seen playing the game at home.  Other things critics have labelled as ridiculous mostly adds to the movie's trashy fun.  For instance, check out the employees of The Hive, all researching a top-secret virus over cups of coffee and all under 25.  On top of that we have Jovovich parading about in a red dress split at the thigh, and whilst the rest of the cast are bitten and maimed she remains with a few delicate smears of dust across her face.  Unfortunately, the story is very inconsistent, and for a while the audience can't be sure what's going on, why Red Queen's mainframe couldn't be overriden from outside and who everyone is supposed to be.
Still, there's actually plenty of elements here that mean 'Resident Evil' is a cut above other computer game adaptations.  Despite being almost totally reliant on dumb jump scares, there's a few things here that have the ability to make you recoil in disgust and a few other creepy elements.  For anyone that's seen similar movies, you just know that when we focus in on the dead woman pressed against the glass of a research lab that she'll open her eyes suddenly.  Thankfully knowing what's coming doesn't take away from a lot of genuinely enjoyable aspects.  For example, the Red Queen's manifestation as a little girl is great fun, as are the zombie Dobermans and Michelle Rodriguez is fantastic in what could easily be a very unrewarding role.
Although this is certainly no classic, it's a good watch and is a lot better than 'Tomb Raider' or 'Street Fighter'.  Even so, anyone over the age of 30 will be scratching their heads, but that's probably the idea, what with a Slipknot-laden soundtrack.",1027123200,10,2554,4.812356979405035

I've been a hardcore horror movie fan for years  and this movie simply had everything; A simple plot that took the viewer straight into gory action; a clean kubrick-like look and plenty of chilling splatterpunk mayhem. I was spellbound  from beginning to end. the last movie that made me feel that way was Reanimator.

2449535,3,B000BYRCR4,"...well I haven't yet and I don't think any of you have either.  This movie is only a small facet of a complex and entertaining genre.  If Resident Evil the Movie is the only exposure to it you have had, I pity you.  When judged individually as cinematic creation, I think this movie fails in a number of fields.  However, if you consider just the content of this movie, it does contribute vital material to the RE universe that all of us non-T-virus infected individuals can extrapolate into our own little Raccoon Cities.  For example, I think Milla's character COULD be a very good addition to the RE cast. It seemed to me she had some depth that Jovovich herself, fans, or writers could have some fun with in the future.  That's one of the neat things about having enough electricity in the ol' melon, even if something (like a mediocre movie) isn't totally enthralling by itself, we can find something interesting WITHIN it.
I found interesting things in RE the Movie and I thought it was worthwhile to see it.  If you are a true Biohazard (they really should have kept that) fan, then I don't need to give you any input about buying the DVD...I hope you already have.  If you have not had much exposure to the RE universe then I recommend spending a few dark, lonely nights with the games or Stephani D. Perry's excellent novels.

2449536,3,B000BYRCR4,"I'm not a big fan of zombie films to be honest.  I've never really seen the attraction of seeing crowds of zombies being killed in manical and violent ways.
""Resident Evil"" is no exception to this rule, but somehow it manages to be entertaining enough to warrant your attention.  The story is based on the top selling computer game although luckily, it doesn't suffer the same fate as films such as ""Tomb Raider"" or ""Super Mario Bros."" by being total rubbish.  the script has been made to take a back seat to eye-catching set pieces and set designs.  This sort of film doesn't require you to take too much notice, and the producers have realised this by giving you just enough of a storyline to keep track of whats going on amongst all the neck-breaking and dog-kicking.  Mila Jovovich proves that her acting abilities ain't exactly Oscar-winning, whilst Michelle Rodrigues just walks around looking angry and grunting a lot.  But this doesn't really matter.  If the characters were anything more than two dimensional, you'd get it confused with Robert Redford film and walk out.  You don't have time to ""bond"" with the characters; theres big zombie dogs to kill before they escape and eat all the Winalot.
It's best to view this film with no big aspirations.  It's almost a re-work of ""Evil Dead"", except Bruce Campbell is now a woman in a red dress.
As i mentioned, this film's stand-out feature are the sets and the fight scenes.  The underground ""Hive"" looks superb, and the laser weapon used during the first 45 minutes will have you saying ""Wasn't that also used in 'The Cube' with Nicole DeBoer?""
See this film if you're feeling annoyed on a Saturday afternoon.  Otherwise, watch an episode of ""Jackass""; it's far more intelligent.",1026950400,2,1738,4.7792642140468224

I have never played the game, or even seen it up close, but I must say that it was one of the better video game-to-movie adaptations I have seen to date. This one had an interesting plot unlike the ""Mortal Kombat"" style of video game movies in which everything from the game is attempted to be squeezed into the film and therefore some items are left out, including a plot sometimes.
The beginning is a little confusing, with everything going on at once. But after everything settles down and all is explained, the movie gets much better. The special effects were quite good, and the acting was convincing too, especially Jovovich and Rodriguez.

2449539,2,B000BYRCR4,"...Ok, as an action film, this is quite good. But as somebody else said before it is aimed really at 15 year old kids. The explosive sound effects and pumping techno sound-track absolutely ruin the atmosphere in my opinion. Where is the tension and suspense that was so abundant in the awesome game ?? And where are the spooky silences and orchestral soundtrack which really made the game.
What made the game such a success was the feeling of tension and genuine uneasiness as you crept around completely alone. Milla Jovovich didn't portray any feelings of anxiety or terror, there was nothing in the film to scare you psychologically at all.
I think Paul Anderson really should have studied some George Romero films before trying his hand at this. Its annoying because Anderson said he had replicated the atmosphere of the game as much as he could - the reality is that he hasn't at all. What game were you playing Mr. Anderson ?
As I said, I think this is one aimed at the younger fans (even though I'm not old myself !). If you want to see an action film, go see it. If you want to be paralysed with fear and suspense - play the game.......

We only went for Milla Jovovich, and in that respect we got an eyeful (literally...keep your eyes peeled in the end for a brief but well-worth-the-wait shot of nudity).  The movie's got bad editing, terrible dialogue, an awful soundtrack and a storyline that makes even less sense than that of ""The City Of Lost Children"".  It was a good film to hoot at the screen for (and hoot we did), so I would imagine that it would make a perfect midnight selection for a party. However, if you're even tempted to rent it to watch with your buds, I would recommend something truly campy like ""Death Race:  2000"" instead.  Hopefully I haven't upset anyone who seriously enjoyed this flick, but rather than lay the DVD in a place of honor, you'd be better off putting your twenty bucks toward the next ""Resident Evil"" game.",1026604800,,936,4.541666666666667

Just look at what happened to Mortal Kombat (Mortal-what?). Times change, however, and Resident Evil is by far one of the best video game to film transfers to date.
The story follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) as she wakes up in a shower. . .
Paul Anderson does a great job of making zombies scary again and uses any CGI to enhance the film instead of degrate it. The action scenes are well done and the story telling is quick paced with a sense of dread through out. The acting is top notch-even though some characters are about as cliched as you get. It's a fun movie for fans of the game or just horror fans in general. Definately worth checking out.",1026604800,11,774,4.49645390070922

I was dissapointed in the fact that not all the chacaters and monsters of the video game were present in the movie. And, most of all, that many, many key elements were cut or changed.

You have to give things a try or else you might miss out on a great thing... If you know the games it helps to learn about the movie.

I have never seen one zombie movie that has scared me.  Infact, my friends and I often rent zombie movies to laugh at them.  How can a rotting corpse with no brain, stummbling about and making odd groaning noises not be funny?

However, this surprisingly is not the reason that I disliked it. I am rather thrown off as to why this film is getting such good reviews by other Amazon.com customers, because in my opinion, the movie is a mindless escapade through one obstacle and another. The film tries to go for intense plot twists, however, the makers of the film must not have realized that if they want intriguing plot development, an existent plot is required. The video games really do give you a sense of uneasiness, however, all this film offers is a brainless combination of Night of the Living Dead and Die Hard. People say that it's no big deal that the story doesn't follow the game, but it is. Reason being, the film IS based on the game, so I'm sorry, but YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE GAME'S PREMISE.

Yes, I saw it 4 times in the theatre.  What can I say?  I loved this one.  And what really surprised me was how clean and tame it was.  Granted there were some gross scenes but I was expecting all-out gory-bloody messes left and right like the movie.  So I was very impressed by that.
Why did I give it only 4 stars you ask?  Well for two reasons:  One, the director totally strayed from the video game story line.  And this movie was mainly bent on the pleasing the fan boys.  And nothing makes a fan boy more mad than straying from the game storyline.  And seccond:  All the Milla fanboy pleasing scenes were not needed at all.

Even though Resident Evil isn't based on one of the widly popular games, it's still good: Flesh eating zombies, mad dogs that look as if their skin had been turned inside-out, (just like the games) and don't forget the lickers.
We start with a ""crazy computer"" that kills everyone in a lab testing with the T-virus. So a team of SWAT-like commandos find two people who have been knocked out by nerve gas or something and take them down to the Umbrella falculity and fight the computer.
Sure, listen to the retarted critics and say, ""That sounds like it sucks!"" Yes, it IS stupid, just like the games but it is, not quite, but ALMOST as gorey, especially the part where the team gets caught in a hallway with a laser that chops them into bits--
my favorite part!
  Well, here's the ratings:
  Setting 10\10: Secret Umbrella lab
  Horror 10,000\10: Mutants, flesh eating zombies, ""crazy"" computer
  Characters 8\10: None from the game, but Michille Rodriguz is hot

I love the games and have defeated them all and i just bought a game cube simply to the R.E. remake so yes i am a true fan of the games themselves which is why i was disappointed with this film. Where was Jill? Where was Claire? Where was Chris? Where was Barry? Where was Wesker? I'm sure you get the point. How can you call a film Resident Evil and then go and not have any of the characters from the game in it? Then when i read that the zombiemaster himself George Romero had walked off the set i just knew it was in trouble. Then an amazing thing happened i saw the film a second time then a third and by then i loved it and it has turned into a fovorite. I have gone on a rampage and purchased a movie poster signed by the cast, various banners, standees and other stuff. I have to say i loved this movie but that was only after i had accepted the fact that Milla was not Jill. Paul Anderson has a good track record as far as i am concerned as i loved Event Horizon which did a wonderful job of blending horror with sci-fi but i still think Resident Evil would have been a better film if Romero had done it. It does lack gore and that certain punch that a zombie film needs and that would have been what Romero brought to the table. Alice doesnt even get a gun until halfway through the movie which is rather disappointing but all in all a very well done quite enjoyable little romp that all fans of the game should own.",1026000000,,1564,3.9213836477987423

It's not The Godfather, or whatever film you may think is ""excellent, 5 stars"", but who cares. Nothing ever is anymore and most likely nothing ever will be again because everyone is sooooo critical.
Sorry, back to the point now. What the film lacked in plot it more than made up for in it's aesthetic appeal. Framing and lighting were well above par. The editing was Tight, Tight, Tight, wrapping up loads of info in short and sweet sequences that over load your brain just enough be excited by what ever otherwise boring, made up, technical fact that you just heard. The sound was completely engrossing which is important for the jumping and the scaring. I normally don't like Marilyn Manson's music, i mean it's really not my thing, but the score was really great.

Soo when this movie came out I dragged my best friend to it ( He was the one who held the party and the on I thought I would most enjoy it with . I have to say that I am not one to deal with scary stuff well at all. Even while playing the game I toss the copontroller to the nearest person whenever I open a door, wraped in a blanket. So we sat there watching the preveiws and muching on popcorn and then it started. From start to finish I don't think I let go of the chair's arm or hyperventalting.

The zombies in the movie seem to hiss and growl more like tigers than flesh eating zombies, the dogs seem to be easily taken down, and as for the mutants, what mutants?  Except for that ONE.  For any true horror fan, i'd suggest playing a resident evil game (try the one on gamecube or re 2) watch the movie and if you're impressed by the movie then hooray for you.  I can honestly say that i was greatly dissapointed by the movie.  I gave it an extra star only because I could see it as another movie other than Resident Evil.  The movie did not do the game any justice.  If you're thinking ""oh this person is just an re fan"" you're right.  I just don't think the movie should have been called Resident Evil.

It's not as gory as all those ridiculous war movies and such that are out these days...but it still manages to capture the true atmosphere and sense of helplessness that made gamers the world over fall in love with the series in the first place. The music, direction,acting and dialogue is incredibly good. And the best part is, you don't need in-depth knowledge of the series to understand the movie.

2449565,2,B000BYRCR4,"There is only one brief moment in Paul W.S. Anderson's misguided film of Resident Evil in which he actually captures the awesomely creepy atmosphere of the original games. It's when we first meet Milla Jovovich's character, dazed and amnesiac, waking up in the shower in a dark and deserted mansion. It's also the only scene that can reasonably be termed ""horror."" For most of the rest of the film, Anderson tries to capture a riff similar to that of James Cameron's Aliens...and fails. Sure, there are specific elements of the game introduced here and there (like the skinned-looking zombie dogs), but what on earth kind of zombie movie is it that has NO GORE!? Perhaps fearing those prudes at the MPAA, Anderson gives us close-ups of muzzle flashes in the gun-battle scenes when any REAL zombie movie would be bestowing its special make-up effects crew with the latest means of molding exploding heads. Make no mistake, this is an action movie, not a horror movie, and not a particularly tense or original one, borrowing as it does from every ""bunch of folks getting picked off one by one"" plot that's come down the pike. (For a movie that's almost identical to this one but actually remembers to be good cheesy fun, try John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars.) There is, now that I remember it, one other shot that reminded me of the game, and that was the final one in which Milla is gazing out upon the Raccoon City street littered with burning cars and wreckage. It's a sign that Anderson could have actually made a Resident Evil movie if he'd wanted to, but he just didn't. I told myself I'd give this DVD a rental if it proved to be an extended unrated director's cut, with excised blood-n-guts restored, but it looks like this ""special edition"" is going to be nothing more than the sanitized-for-your-protection theatrical edit after all.

The director usually tries to follow the game too closely, which makes for a scattered plot and a lot of fighting(Mortal Kombat:Annihilation), a movie where no one has any idea what the story is about(Final Fantasy), or a movie that's cheesy in every reguard(Mario Brothers).
Paul Anderson does an exellent job making this movie appeal to the general public while still keeping it tied to some of the plot of the video game. He starts the movie off fast paced and keeps it going throught the entire movie, all the while managing to tell us the plot before killing off that character as needed. For the premise he was given, Anderson did a good job at making the idea able to be mass marketed while still keeping some elements that would appeal to the fans.

The movie takes off like a rocket and the action doesn't stop 'til the end - and that's when you suddenly realize the ride is almost over and you start wishing for more. After years of hunching over our CRT, killing zombies and other dead maniacs, finally, someone in the last decade has made a decent ""kill-the-dead-thing"" flick.

For the life of me can't see how they got the microphone in so many scenes in this film, every other shot you see the damn thing hanging over the actor's heads.

I found out they were going to have a new story with new characters and only 3 monsters: the zombies, howlers, and licker. I got back into it because I found out this was going to be a prequel to the games giving them a back-story. I downloaded it first off the internet to see if it was truly good and it was. Then I saw it in theatres. It was excellent, it suprised that the guy who did Mortal Kombat: Anihilation did this film.

The creepy atmosphere, the terror of being eaten alive, the stress in trying to conserve your dwindleing supply of Ammo.  Also, to all of those who said there wasn't enough gore, Paul Anderson had to cut out some scenes to avoid a NC-17 rating, but he said that he would probably include them in the DVD.

The story line is unique but badly portrayed with corny scenes that makes you think ""oh no, they're doing that matrix bit again"". The zombies can be related to an 80's style dracula-like movie; the only real feeling you get is from the fast pumped and creepy music from Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Static X, etc.

2449584,3,B000BYRCR4,"While the Resident Evil movie adaptation of the game didn't hold any Acadamy Award winning performances or groundbreaking special effects, it was a great popcorn movie.  It was truly scary in some parts and had practically non-stop action throughout.  During the action scenes, all I could keep saying was, ""I wish I had a game controller and could play this!""  That, and how cool it was.
  The movie's musical score, composed by none other than Marilyn Manson, was really well done, adding a definite techno-horror feel to the film.  One track, called ""Seizure of Power"", is a really driving piece of music which makes you lean forward in your seet while watching the movie, ready for whatever might come next.
  The story line is rather original, actually.  Anyone who was expecting it to be just like the first game was in for a major shock:  it wasn't.  The story follows a new line of characters, mostly an Umbrella Special Forces team, sent to the Raccoon City Secret Umbrella Lab (called the Hive) to shut down a haywire computer system that killed all the scientists in the lab after a T-Virus leak.  It sounds kinda cheesy, but, believe me, the first time the Red Queen (computer system) warns the team to leave, chills will run all over you!
  All in all, Resident Evil is a really fun action-horror film for both fans of the game and horror-movie buffs.  It's a great movie to watch on a Friday night with some popcorn and a thunder storm outside!",1024012800,6,1458,4.662745098039216

  At first I thought that this movie was going to be a desaster when I heard that the movie was going to have it's own story, and it's own characters, instead of taking them from the games.  But Paul W.S. Anderson pulled it off with an amazing cast of actors such as Milla Jovovich(The Fifth Element), and Eric Mabius(The Crow: Salvation).  But this movie did have a few downfalls, such as there was no Tyrant character that goes on a killing spree like in the games but instead they used the horrifying Licker creature from the game RE2.  It would've been better if they had a Tyrant and a Licker.  And I think they killed off to many people in the laser hallway scene.  But other than that this movie is a must see.  Also the ending is amazing (I won't ruin it for you but it sets it up for a spectacular sequel)

The movie follows the early beginnings of the games goes mostly to the prequel game though called Resident Evil zero (gamecube). The costumes and effects were done well and kept to the dark nature of the game. It comes down to being one of the best video game movies released yet. I mean what did it have a fight against Tombraider? but thats another story. The movie is well acted but they lose too much of the search party too early in. I mean 4 members 30 minutes into the movie that was overkill. All in all the movie was well worth the wait of almost 2 years of hype.,1023580800,,743,4.276595744680851

2449599,4,B000BYRCR4,"I own the dvd.. how come i can't tell without doing something to you. I don't see resident evil (the movie) getting so much praise as the video game which came before it got. Yeah, sure it was nice enough, but nice doesn't really cut it when it comes down to this genre of film.
Mila Jovovich (fifth element) gives an outstanding acting performance and the Dark Angel chick wasn't half bad either. Yet they failed to really make the movie. The special effects, the setting and the plot were highly unoriginal and the makers should have deviated more from the game story line to make this movie into what it could have been.
If you want to see what I mean with ""could have been"" watch Jeepers Creepers or Blade II and you'll see what I mean. A cocktail of gore, suspense, credibilty and high tech cinematography....

2449600,3,B000BYRCR4,"I have played none of the video games so I must judge Resident Evil as a movie alone, and this is a good one.
There is a disappointing beginning which sets up the movie as standard Hollywood formula (i.e. garbage). As events progress it becomes clear that the writers actually know how to make a good movie (we must keep Hollywood from killing or corrupting them!). There is a scene which looks like a formula-movie contrived ending, but it isn't the end! This gave me a letdown, followed by a swift kick; an incredibly refreshing approach to audience entertainment.
The atmosphere becomes extremely intense after the Doomed Elite Team discovers they have been lied to by their employer, the Faceless Evil Corporation. Be warned: There are a lot of cheap scares, especially with the infected bodies (zombies) and I felt that detracted from the overall effect.
I don't normally get into horror, but Resident Evil is effective. I'm already waiting for the sequel.

2449604,5,B000BYRCR4,"I was one of the naysayers who initially believed this film would fail without the guiding hand of George Romero. He is, as many of us remember, the man who was originally picked to direct ""Resident Evil."" When Paul Anderson was chosen to replace him, I seriously had my doubts over whether he would possess the proper credentials to tackle a film of this nature. Now, after having seen ""Resident Evil"" twice in theaters, I can definitely say my hastiness to prematurely slam it was wrong because, people, this movie flat out rocked!!! Paul Anderson surprised me.
  The story, itself, is more or less, a mishmash; more of a prequel to the events in the games than anything else. So, don't expect to see any characters from the games. That, I am told, will be happening with the sequel, ""Nemesis,"" which is currently being put together as I write.
  This had everything for me: Zombies, those vicious killer dogs, and the oh-so-awesome licker! The opening segment that explains how the T-Virus gets released was handled exceptionally well, I thought. And the ending? A perfect set-up for the sequel which, to be quite honest, I absolutely cannot wait to see. If the ""Nemesis"" is anything near to what he is in the ""Resident Evil 3"" game, that movie will be just as good-(if not better)-than this one.
  So, please do not listen to the people who are slamming ""Resident Evil."" They are the same people who, like many critics, go to ""Friday The 13th"" films looking for character development. That, in itself, is as silly as watching ""There's Something About Mary"" for it's heart-wrenching drama. No, folks, this is a zombie film through and through, quite possibly one of the very best since Romero's ""Day Of The Dead.""

Only these two have given me nightmares after watching them, and that propels me to see them, again, and again. Now why people are giving such bad reveiws of the movie I don't know, it is impossible to adapt a move completly!

2449608,1,B000BYRCR4,"...Sorry to all the Capcom fans out there, but this movie goes into the vault of all the rest of the video-games-turned-movie[s]. ...The story takes a odd jump from a office building that is terminated by a unknown machine that kills all the employees, to a half-naked...er, whole-naked woman waking up in a bathtub in a weird mansion.  Alice (Milla Jovovich) has amnesia from what just happened.  Only seconds later, the mansion is attacked and bombarded by gung-ho S.W.A.T.-like marines with roughneck attitudes...(yawn)!  Alice is taken captive, were there she is revealed to be a member of the squad...but she doesn't remember.  Alice meets a mysterious cop (Eric Mabius) and a charming nobody (James Purefoy) that later turns out to be a charming jerk-off...or is that a jerk-off nobody?  The Marines and the 3 are taken to a an underground lab, where the same inccident took place at the very beginning.  The machine that killed the office employees is already planning to kill the marines...As for the basic plot?  Well, when I mean ""basic"", I mean it was as if the writer just watched ""Aliens"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", took out his laptop computer and started writing a remake of the movie he had just watched and titled it ""Resident Evil""...because he just saw a commercial for some game called ""Resident Evil""...
Seriously, folks.  You need to go out and see REAL films and not just hokey sequels or dumb wannabes.  RE is pathecticly shown and scripted.  The entire movie is basically ""Aliens"" in an underground office space that looks like the headquarters for Washington Mutual bank company than a secret organization, with Zombies, mutant dogs and a grumpy computer.  Oh, and as for the mutants?  The zombies look more like homeless bums with horrible teeth hygene than flesh eating monsters.  The mutant dogs are just Dobermens with Halloween make-up on their faces.  As for the rest of the mutants, like the ""Hunters"" and ""Lickers""?  Well, let's just say that Rick Baker must be turning in his grave...wait a minute...nevermind.  The ""Lickers"" in the RE video-game were much better, were as in the film, they're piles of doo-doo that have the intelligence of a pasture cow.  The ""Hunters"" in the video-game version kicked butt totally, with their pumped-up bodies and bad attitute, were as in the film (this has to be the cheapest idea I've ever heard), they are actually ""Lickers"" evolved...where ...did that come from???  The CGI in this film is absolutely terrible.  It looks like it was done on a home computer!!!  The characters are terribly one-dimensional and have no purpose...either than to be eaten alive by monsters.  What really ticked me off was the fact that some characters in the film get close to death in one scene that is very pulse-pounding, survive, only to be mutalated anti-climatically 10 minutes later.  It was as if the director was sitting in his chair and constantly his assistant would come up to him and ask ""So...do we kill him now?"" and he would say ""Nah, better wait a few more minutes"".  This was totally annoying.  I absolutely hated Jovovich's character for her lack of common sense.  Ofcourse, these days, if you want to make a action film, gotta put in stupid ""Matrix""-style moves.  God, am I getting sick of that same formula of action!!!!  How is it that you can jump against a wall and kick a dog in mid-air motion?  Please!  Probably the worse thing by far in this flick was the ending......",1022025600,4,3454,4.836456558773424

2449611,3,B000BYRCR4,"Well first off this film was far above any expectations that I ever had. I played all the RE games to come out on PC and playstation, anyone who hasn't played them should know that these games are legendary and coined the phrase 'survival horror' to describe their puzzle solving/action/horror/roleplaying style. Playing throught the games themselves is no so far detatched from watching a film as they have story lines (quite good ones too) and closing credits. They are a really great suspensefull and in their own right cinematic experiance.
After the slew of terrible video game films (Mario brothers, the live action street fighter, double dragon, two mortal combats and the extremely [bad] tombraider film) I was expectining a terrible unwatchable film. Anyway I got a hold of a bootleg and was surprised to find that the movie was very decent. The sets are close to the gaming enviourments, especially the train (a scene from the game when the monster attacks throught the wall of the carige is recreated in the film) and the mansion while not the same as RE 1 still had the same feel and decor. The story was in line with the game plots, which is great seenings how I expect some wise guy director to rewrite the story for 'his film'.
There is plenty of nail biting suspense, ...But still I cannot bring myself to really like this movie even though it is true to the games simply because it completely lacks any graphic flesh eating scenes. I guess that truely gorey scenes are not in vogue in mainstream horror productions which is a shame because with such a big special f/x budget and some first 20minutes of saving private ryan quality make up, they could have created some truely gut wrenching zombie flesh eating scenes. I mean it is no where near as great as zombie films like braindead (or a hidiously cut dead/alive in the states), dawn/day of the dead, zombie, beyond ect it would be piontless to list the amount of supieror ""zombie"" films, not to memtion it would require more that 1000 words just for the titles.
So in conclusion this is hands down the best game to movie adaptation ever! But if like me you enjoy a good zombie flick and are expecting gore, gore and more gore you will be sorely disappointed. Highly recomended for the squeamish.",1021852800,7,2266,4.681704260651629
2449612,2,B000BYRCR4,"When this movie was released in Australi, not many theatres picked it up. I can see why.
A pathetic remake of a video game classic, it follows the likes of Mortal Kombat (by the same director) and Tomb Raider. Although director Paul Anderson did well in creating tension, and overall adding a rather eerie and freaky element to the movie, the actual story has many things left to be desired.
There are a few goods bits though. The start was well contrived, leading the watchers to feel for the soon-to-be-killed employees of the Umbrella corporation.
It falls rapidly downhill from there. Somehow, directors seem to get a thrill in having leading star Milla Jovovich naked when we first see her and when we leave her (think Fifth Element). It wasn't much of an acting challenge for Jovovich, just a few looks here and there, and a number of well-placed kicks. The supporting actors were not much better. Michelle Rodriguez, known better as Lennie in The Fast and the Furious, puts on an act not unlike Velazques in Aliens.
Highlights include the laser killing techniques that bring to mind the opening sequence of alternative movie Cube, which used thin wires for the same effect, the death sequences, the alarming jump that one gets when a former employee reanimates for the first time, and the startling eery super-computer, the Red Queen, which in my opinion was the best character of the lot.
Even the casting of dancers as the zombies was a good idea, making their movements realistic.
But the whole story had a lot of flaws. The explaination of the zombies was extremely inaccurate and unbelievable, as well as their following of our 'heros'.
As a business student too, the actions of the Umbrella Corporation after the Hive was sealed and the survivors rescued was extremely inaccurate. But I won't get into that.
Apart from the small highlights, the movie was extremely poor. Only watch it if you are a die-hard fan, or like getting kicks from extreme gore.",1021766400,2,1965,4.816568047337278

Unfotunately, what they don't realize is that awaiting them are hordes of the living dead who are hungry for human flesh!  Action/horror film directed by Paul Anderson mixes in elements from Cube, Ghosts of Mars, and Day of the Dead, and is never entirely successful, due to some bad acting (Jovovich, surprisingly enough, being the exception), a grating industrial musical score, and zombie shootouts that aren't directed with as much flair or intensity as you might expect.  Still, there are several standout sequences that are tense and thrilling, particularly a scene where approaching lasers try to make mincemeat out of the team inside an enclosed hallway, several exciting fight scenes against zombies, and the suspenseful finale that pits the survivors against a monstrous genetic experiment.  Definitely recommended to genre fans, and once again, Jovovich just rocks in this movie.",1021766400,2,1082,5.347058823529411

Perry it would have been amazing but they decided to go original. its still a great movie but i just wish it was based on the novelization done for the first game! the thing i was very happy with was the ending. its not sad but its not good. its got the perfecvt lead off to a sequel. i only hope its based off of either resident evil 2 or resident evil 3: nemesis. if so, its gonna rock!",1021680000,,786,4.143790849673203

...Anyways, down to business. Resident Evil is based on the very good video game on the Sega Saturn, Playstation, N64, Dreamcast and the recent PS2 and Gamecube and Gameboy Color.
Right, first off *ahem* DON'T BRING YOUR BRAIN TO SEE THIS MOVIE! It ain't a thinker. This movie is a low down dirty horror/ action movie. It's everything a movie was meant to be... fun!
The plot (as you've no doubt already read in these other reviews) is that a team is brought in to see what went wrong with this secreat underground base called ""The Hive"" that runs biological weapons. Such as the dreaded T-virus, which can turn anything into the walking undead or a horrible mutant. This team gets locked in the hive by the malfunctioning super computer called the ""Red Queen"" with a whole butt-load of zombies. Oh, and an evil creature called ""The Licker"" is also loose and after there [butts]. So they do what any normal tantics team does in this sort of situation. Kick some [butt] and try to survive!

This Movie plays like it's Dawn of the Dead meets Aliens, which surprisingly works well but It's does have Some Weakness and also has some unintentional laughs coming from the Dialogue. Anderson brings a stylish Edge to the Film and Even when the Zombies are Scary. Jovovich looks good in this Flick, also Michelle Rodriguez and Eric Mabius gives Good Performances. The ending isn't great but it's a set-up for a Sequel. Resident Evil wasn't a Huge Hit in Theaters, since there's a sequel in the works.

2449625,3,B000BYRCR4,"I have always had a keen interest in zombie moviesand horror films and have spent time watching some of George A Romearo's classics such as night of the living dead etc.. Resident Evil is a movie trying to get out of its shell, it has the potential to be a great movie with some tweaks. As I watched the movie and it quite frequently kept jumping from place to place giving no real focus on ceratin parts of the film, not giving you time to settle. No real description of the chracters was given at the start of the movie, and it wasn't until half-way through you finally really found out what was going on. On the good side this film did offer some good scare factors with some well crafted zombie sceanes and fancy lazer rooms (if not seen before) Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez do a good job as the lead roles in this film and play there parts well. I did see this film before it comes out in the UK and I will see in the cinema before I pass my final judgement.
The main point I really have to make is resident evil doesn't go out of its way to shock you do death with gore, unlike George A Romearo's Dawn of the dead and day of the dead sequal's to the very good night of the living dead, which did have a genuine scare factor. Dawn of the dead and day of the dead are fairly OK films but George Romearo just slapped them with gore and expected you to be scared, I was basically discussed. Those films were a far cry from such comedy classics such as Braindead, which I think is banned in America (shame on you). Anyway i'm getting away from the point if you like zombie films go see Resident evil, if you love films with a fantastic story and amazing acting this film is not for you. Ignor some of the patchy story and you will love it.",1020124800,,1749,4.162241887905605

2449637,5,B000BYRCR4,"Wow!
I'm a big fan of Horror movies and have probably seen hundreds of them over the years, especially enjoying what the 80's had to offer, but Andersons Resident Evil has taken the genre to a new high standard.

This is a slick production with great perfomances from a mostly unknown cast, and the action sequences were worth the admission fee's alone(Watch for the Zombie Dog scene, its breath taking).  It would seem that they have gone to a lot of trouble to remain true to the game which preceeds it, and it was certianly worth the effort.  Crammed with plenty of great action scenes, gore, suspense and pure horror throughout, this is a dance with adrenalin itself.
If you enjoyed the game, then this is a must see, you won't be disappointed.  When finally released, I will definately be adding the DVD to my library(In pride and place no less) and I'm holding my breath for RE2 .....

Does he suceed ?
F##k YEAH !
+ Plus points: Jovovich and Madius both give great parts while Rodriguez steals every sceen she's in (wait for the blood Driping taunt part ;). It also work as a who-dunnit as you see at the start of the film when a mystery figure releases the virus. Marilyn Manson's composed score is briliant, the guy has hidden depths to his talents and is a must for any sequels !
- Minus. points: Few, a few people will liken a certain scene to CUDE but i still think this is cooler. Also the main beasty(LICKER) is a little too C.G.I.
++ Eyes Peeled: The final shot with Manson's main theme will have you screaming for the sequel !(and hopefully a full Trilogy)

It stayed more true to the game then I thought it would and even though the movie's over all plot had nothing in common with the video game series plot, it still astounded me. Paul W.S. Anderson has done something unique with a beloved video game franchise. Most video game movie transfers are horrid and shoddy but this one is a huge exception to that rule.

2449644,5,B000BYRCR4,"As a fan of the Resident Evil videogames, I was over excited to see the film. When news first sparked that the film would be made, I actually overreacted with excitement. As I sat in the movie theatre, waiting for the previews to be over, I could barely contain my excitement. I was like a little child waiting to see another Toy Story, except Resident Evil is far from being another Toy Story.
 Resident Evil is a prequel to the games. It all starts off by showing us the Hive, an ubersecret testing facility that is underneath the fictional town of Raccoon City. When a virus is purposely released into the atmosphere of the facility, the security system takes over and locks the place up, locking up and murdering all of the facility's workers. Above ground in a mansion, Alice (Mila Jovovich) wakes up with a case of amnesia, and is soon bombarded by a team of ""commandos"" that go into the underground facility to figure out what happened. After this, chaos ensues and zombies are hoarded.
 My excitement for Resident Evil was not failed or a waste of time. Everything this movie gave, I was completely happy with it. First off, with any Resident Evil fan, the first thing you will look for are the zombies and references to the games. The zombies were excellent and I must note that the first zombie to attack was creepy as mess. The references to the games didn't really come until the last 15 minutes of the film, and it made the film 10 times better. Especially the final scene in which I was almost gaping at. The acting wasn't topnotch, but enough feeling was given to make the film. Mila Jovovich stole the show of course. Michelle Rodriguez and Eric Mabius also did noteworthy jobs, but I'm getting a little tired of Rodriquez playing the smart-arse girl even though she does it well.
 This review is given by a Resident Evil fan, so undoubtedly, some people will think the film was trash. But I certainly do not. It rests high on my list of favorite movies.",1019260800,,1970,4.543661971830986

I love that they kept having Alice(Milla Jovovich) remember important things about Umbrella and her Marriage. Even though the movie wasn't terribly scary it did have its jumpy points. The movie had your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. I think it was a plus that they didn't give us any important info in the begining of the movie. It made it a lot more interesting if we discovered these key things right along with Alice. It made it seem as though we were remembering things along with her. I really love the gore that they put into this movie, esspessially the laser hall. It is worth going to the movie just for that scene. When they said they were going to push the violence they did and it's great. You get everything from broken ankles and decapitations to severed limbs and zombies riddled with bullets.

What a way to show the events that led up to the best RPG game series that Capcom has ever created.  Alice is a kick-butt heroine and if they were to keep creating Resident Evil movies, I would want her to come back and play Jill Valentine (for all those who know Resident Evil 1 and Nemesis)
Speaking on Nemesis, it is amazing how they incorporated Matt into becoming that horrid creature.  That guy still gives me the willies when he jumps around the corner to kill me. (Tee hee hee).

I can't remember when the movie was announced, but it was a very long time ago. I want to say 1998, not long after Resident Evil 2 was released. I think I was a little optimistic at the news, but months and months went by with no more word of the movie actually being made, just rumors that George Romero was possibly being brought on to direct, and then that he wasn't. Finally, the first details and publicity photos emerged. It looked and sounded... well, pretty bad. It was revealed that the plot revolved around an ""evil computer"". This wasn't good news, since NONE of the games involve such. It sounded like it was going to be yet another weak video game cash-in; ""Ah, who cares what's in the games, that stuff won't work in a movie. We'll start from scratch, as long as there's zombies in it, those mindless, idiot gamers will be happy."" I pretty much lost interest in it. But then couple of months ago I saw the trailers, and my curiosity was once again piqued. It looked like it might actually not [be that horribly bad]. (edited by Amazon)

After finally seeing it tonight, I'm happy to say that this movie did a damn good job of invoking the feel and atmosphere of the RE games. It isn't 100% dead-on, it took a few liberties... but they were never really a detriment. It stands up to the games very well, and it's a good popcorn/horror flick in its own right. There were a few moments when I was truly HORRIFIED. I really don't think it's necessary to have played the games to enjoy this movie, not at all.

Paul Anderson did a good job with directing this film and I give him credit because I saw Mortal Kombat, which he directed, and thought he did a horrible job.
Resident Evil has the state-of-the-art special effects.  Specially with the laser grid part.  The Licker, the one monster, looked really cool.
I don't want to give away any of this movie, but a little advice.  Be prepared to jump because I was so shocked I jumped seven times. Enjoy! I know you will.",1018742400,,837,4.570469798657718
2449663,4,B000BYRCR4,"I loved it. The only flaes I found were the lack of creatures(I WANTED MY HUNTERS!!), and the fact that the people you feel bad for are who you have grown to HATE, or really dislike...Umbrella operatives. The movie answered the question ""Where did Nemisis come from?"". I liked what they did with the licker though. I give it a 4/5",1018656000,,330,4.426229508196721

2449675,5,B000BYRCR4,"To my surprise, Resident Evil was a excellent movie.  I really did enjoy Anderson's, ""Mortal Kombat"" so it was no surprise that I would enjoy this movie.  Don't get me wrong though, because I did have my doubts about this movie.  Most video game movies tend to flop for example, Street Fighter and Super Mario Brothers.  Don't get Paul Anderson confused with Mortal Kombat Annihilation because he had nothing to do with that HORRIBLE movie.

The movie actually takes place one month prior to the Playstation Game Resident Evil and ends at some point within Resident Evil 2 and 3.  How?  I will explain later in the review.  The only think I disliked about the movie was the mansion set used in the movie itself.  It looked nothing like the Mansion used in PSOne Resident Evil.  The interior of the mansion followed the style of PSOne Resident Evil, but many hardcore gamers will immediately point out that the Mansion is completely different on the outside.  Every thing else follows close the game format and can possibly be tied into the game.

Many people will immediately identify Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez in the movie.  Other actors are no names, but one actor named Eric Mabius is one to keep a eye on.  The movie is centered around a huge underground laboratory under Raccoon City called the Hive which is owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation.  A virus is unleashed by a insider within the Hive and you know what comes next...Zombies Galore!  If you remember the games, Umbrella is known for one thing, cover ups and they attempt to cover up this mess by completely sealing the Hive off with everyone trapped inside.  A special ops team is dispatched to clean up the mess by making sure if this leaks to the public, Umbrella will not be blamed.  Milla is dragged into the mess not knowing that she also works for Umbrella.  When the team fails to accomplish thier mission, their new mission is to get out of the Hive ALIVE!  Get ready for some excellent nail biting suspense and action as they attempt to get out of the Hive.

It has been announced that a Resident Evil 2 is in the works already and will star Milla Jovovich and Eric Mabius who will play the ""Nemesis"".  Resident Evil ends somewhere within PS1 Resident Evil 2 and 3.  You have to remember that in the PS1 Resident 3, PS1 Resident Evil 2 took place when Jill Valentine was injurned and poisened by the Nemesis.  Two other characters from the game will be showing up in Resident Evil 2.  Gina Phillips will be cast as Claire Redfield and Natasha Henstridge will be cast as Jill Valentine.  This is going to be interesting to see them together on the screen when they never really met in the Playstation Game Series Resident Evil.  We know that Claire was in Raccoon City looking for her brother Chris and Jill Valentine was attempting to get out of Raccoon City Alive.  I sure can't wait to see how Paul Anderson will bring this movie together in Resident Evil 2.  If you are a fan of Resident Evil, I know you can't wait too!",1018569600,33,3021,4.563197026022305
2449676,4,B000BYRCR4,"I'm a big fan of zombie flicks and horror movies in general. If you're like me and you miss the days of Evil Dead and just want to see Scream vanish from the planet, you might see this movie as a breath of fresh air. It's not full of gore (hardly any blood for that matter) but it's definetely a step in the right direction considering the terrible place that horror movies have been in the past 5 years or so (scream, i know what you did last summer etc)
FX wise, I was also very impressed. Alot of films nowadays use tons of cgi and it takes alot away from the film. The Mummy for example... Who's going to be afraid of some 100% cgi mummy!??
Thankfully the cgi is done in a very artistic way. It's used to make jaws on zombies look transparent where there are holes etc. Overall, it's a great movie to go see if you're sick of the past few years of horror movies and are wanting to see the best of what horror has to offer, new and old.",1018310400,,939,4.053763440860215

The movie although not following the game linearly, to my chagrin, was a pleasant excusion from what we normally expect from Resident Evil titles, much to my delight!  There are many aspects to the movie the alude to the series, especially the end scene with raccon city torn to shreds similar if not exactly like the opening scenes of RE2!  This movie has everything, action, a strong yet simple plot, great cast of new comers, very little use of CG effects, and surprises.  The biggest being the use of the same camera angles used in the RE:Director's Cut.  Simply awesome!  The atmosphere and mood of the movie were right on, and the soundtrack/score set it off in a way nothing else could. Kudos! Kudos! Kudos!

2449678,1,B000BYRCR4,"Twenty years ago, a movie like ""Resident Evil"" would have been considered a horror masterpiece, heralded for its social commentary on the evils of the advancement of mankind, and praised for its stunning array of action sequences and make-up and special effects. Here, in the age of movies like last's year's ""Thirteen Ghosts"" and countless other entries into the horror genre, it's a big, obnoxious, at times baffling effects show fueled by incoherence and banality.
The film is derived from a popular video game franchise, which would explain why the plot feels jumbled, or why its characters feel flaccid and empty. It begins with an introduction that is aggravating in its choice of leaving too much in the dark to be explained later in a less-than-admirable manner. The world is dominated by major corporations, many of which deal in such things as genetic and viral testing and experimentation. In a series of chain reactions, an underground laboratory known as the Hive is contaminated by a viral strand, after which its computer, referred to as the Red Queen, begins the containment process, locking its hundreds of employees within the complex, and extinguishing them.
Enter Milla Jovovich (character names matter not in such a film), who awakens after a fall in the shower to find a mysterious scar on her shoulder, a strange note left in her bedroom, and a dresser drawer that holds a full arsenal of weaponry. Equally unsettling is the storming of her elite home, where she, along with Eric Mabius, is taken into an underground cavern through a hidden door in her home, and transported by rail to the Hive. This sequence, as well as those to come, is poorly shot, with the use of flashy cinematography and quick-cuts; it matters little, though, because to see it clearly would not be to like it more.
The underground setting itself is another slap in the face, being everything you'd expect from a movie such as this: endless hallways of steel, an abundance of fluorescent lighting, and a sense of claustrophobia that goes unnoticed in director Paul Anderson's eyes. Joining Jovovich and Mabius is a team of gun-toting security guards led by Michelle Rodriguez. The objective of their mission centers on the Red Queen, whom they must reboot in order to regain access to the Hive's many chambers, presumably to find some answers to the lockdown.
The real evil that resides here is the story's desperation to try and provide coherent solutions to its mysteries. Once things start going awry after the opened doors release the many undead facility workers, victims of the viral strand, the story descends further into camp territory, recalling plot twists and surprises from previous horror and science fiction films, some better, some of the same caliber.
... The overall film boasts a loud, aggressive soundtrack replete with heavy bass and ear-splitting treble, becoming aggravating and obnoxious without ever attaining our interest. There are innumerable amounts of quick jolts, in which undead zombies jump onto screen to a beat of the music; the abundance of such tactics quickly grows tiresome and redundant. The antagonists themselves, from the sleep-walking zombies and inside-out Dobermans, to the clich-riddled monster that can change form and attain the strength of its victims, do nothing to raise the fear factor, providing more laughs than scares.
On those grounds, ""Resident Evil"" is little more than another horror entry riddled with familiarity and incoherence, banal characters and lousy plotting, that feels less like a movie and more like disjointed cinematic interludes that appear during the course of a video game.",1017964800,2,3647,5.120805369127517
2449679,4,B000BYRCR4,"Regardless of what others have said (armchair critics) this movie was pretty good. What I think it needed was not to be cut so much. It seemed to go from one scene to the next with jump cuts that practically gave you whiplash (like going from the scene where there in the office And Milla kills the guys sister, right to them getting a back to the rest of the team running from the Zombies without anything in between). There was more of this movie people! I think the things that kept it from being great were left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully the'll come out with a directors cut.

There is absolutely nothing redeeming about it whatsoever. The only frightening parts of this wreck are the dreadful script, the haggard plot (people blast a bunch of zombies while trying to shut down a supercomputer in an underground lab), and weak acting by equally weak actors. Milla Jovovich is a far cry from Angelina Jolie as a respectable female action hero, no matter how hard the media tries to incite a rivalry between them.

The editor is obviously talented.  The production design crew was obviously talented.  The story was salvageable.  Nonetheless, the film just plain stucked!  1) The directing of the actors was completely unconvincing. Every character and every emotional expression seemed like the director had no ability to pull an original, believable performance out of these capable actors.  2) It was totally derivative of films like Aliens and countless video games: ""Keep it tight people"", ""Get over here!"" etc, etc. 3) The gore was pointlessly disgusting to the point of connoisseurship, as if gore fans will be sipping their Pepsi like fine wine and commenting in a faux English accent, ""Ah yes, that's just wonderful how the white of his eye just leaked out of that laser cut. And, oh my, the sound of walking on broken ankles is just an exhilarating aural bouquet.""  I think people are actually getting off on this stuff, which is just sick.  4) The cinematography, which again must be approved by the director, is totally overdone.  Every single shot is seemingly an extreme close up or swooping crane movement or some other camera technique that is best used in moderation.  It's again just contrived to the point of aggravation.  5) The plot development and character development is totally out of whack, so that we don't know who anyone is or why we should give a damn until halfway into the film, and this is not in a good way like in Memento.  6) A giant beehive-like underground corporate R&D complex, a supercomputer AI programmed as the dead daughter of the programmer, self defense mechanisms that meet the ridiculous criteria parodied in Galaxy Quest...I could go on and on with the laughable ideas portrayed in this film.  Even worse is the ridiculous exposition the characters indulge in to relay these facts to us.  In the end I was left with a serious case of that ""bad film"" feeling.

It is up to Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez with the assistance of cop Eric Mabius to confront and isolate the virus. Accompanying them is an elite task force - and the situation is critical with the time factor going against them. They have to reach the Red Queen, the mother of the computer network that powers and defend the Hive.
Unless you are a computer fanatic of the popular Capcom game and its spawned 3 sequels or wanting to get a thrill from seeing the protagonists battling terrifying obstacles through the dark labyrinths, you might want to spare yourself from surviving a horrible movie.
It is a splatter of unnecessary gore with decapitated corpses and mindless violence that desensitized rather than offer true scares. The phalanx of cannibals and vampire-like troops eating people alive and animatronic creatures like Licker, Zombie Dogs doesn't exactly fascinate either. Paul WS Anderson who also helmed the cheesy Mortal Kombat makes a movie that is stocked full of grunge rock to compensate for its lack of atmosphere.
The only saving grace of the movie is Milla Jovovich hiking up the kick... factor with her resilient mantle. Otherwise the movie is a sputtering mess - and it's a shame when horror-chiller George A Romero of the famed Living Dead trilogy inspired this movie.

2449685,4,B000BYRCR4,"Resident Evil (Paul W. S. Anderson, 2002)

No, Paul W. S. Anderson is no relation to Paul Thomas Anderson (of Magnolia fame). Anyone who's seen Resident Evil probably knows that without having to be told. But I get the feeling that even Paul Thomas Anderson fans will get at least a guilty kick out of this movie. Hey, you've got beautiful women, hard-case police officers, loud music, a psychotic computer, and a bunch of zombies. What more could you possibly ask?

Paul W. S. Anderson, responsible for bringing us the fun little flick Event Horizon five years ago, turns his attention to videogames here. He opens with a scene right out of The Stand; a bacteriological contagion races through an office building, while the computer that runs the building, fearing the contagion getting out, seals it off, killing everyone inside. Cut to Alice (Milla Jovovich, last seen by Americans crossing swords with Dustin Hoffman in The Messenger), naked, passed out, and in the shower. ...She, along with a number of other law enforcement types, head into the Hive to find out what went wrong. Complications, as they say...

Those who have played the video game series (I've only played a demo of the second game) will find lots of little homages within the film, at least according to the trivia section of IMDB; so will fans of George Romero films (both Dawn and Day of the Dead are well-represented with visual cues and the like; Romero was originally slated to direct this film) and Alice in Wonderland (Alice is fighting a computer called The Red Queen... In fact, some folks will have enough fun with the movie playing spot-the-reference that they won't really have to have much else for the film to be worth the admission price. For the rest of us, there's more than enough action (almost nonstop after the team has been in the Hive for about ten minutes), decent acting from a cadre of rising B-list actors (along with Jovovich, we have Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, and a number of easily-recognizable others), more jump-out-of-your-seat moments than in any so-called horror film from the last decade, and, well, zombies. How bad can a film be if it's got zombies?... Add in a Marilyn Manson-scored soundtrack, shake, chill, and serve.

Not many names were mentioned in the movie except for Rain, but this was definetely one of those edge of your seat type movies. I stayed tense through the whole movie and I normally don't get scared or jumpy through any movie. Definetly good if you want to be scared. The plot was real good in the beggining, but it went downhill from there, mostly because it was confusing and didn't make much sense and the end left you hanging in a most unpleasent way, which is why I didn't give it five stars.

The original game (currently being remade for Nintendo GameCube) had the perfect premise for a scary movie, it had the atmosphere, the monsters, the suprises and everything that kept a person on thier toes, all things which the movie that was made a s a prequel did not have. WHat did this movie have that was good? Michelle Rodrigiez is very good looking... aside from that... There were some great makeup effects, but the one non-zombie monster that appeared was the licker, which looked terribly CGI. Over all the special effects were unimpressive, they held back way to much with the gore, and there was far more eye roller moments than scares. This is what we call a hack fest flick, except there wasn't a lot of hacking... so there wasn't a lot going on here that would make it a good horror flick. The problem with a lot of game based movies is that the movies don't follow the games closely enough, that's why only Mortal Kombat has succedded to be a good movie so far, but Mortal Kombat Annihilation strayed too far from the original plot of MK 2 and failed miserably because of it. The same can be said of all of the other game based movies. Many of them have been moderate successes, but we gamers go to see these hoping for a movie that will be true to the games, not be related by name only.

2449702,4,B000BYRCR4,"Resident evil is a movie that will be liked by several different audiences.  There are aspects that will be liked and disliked by horror movie fans, as well as fans of the game.  For a movie based on a video game, it was very well done.  For the most part the story stayed true to the video game's plot.  Some of the characters from the game were missing which I'm sure will upset more than a few.  But all in all, the feel of the video game runs true.  There was a scene where Milla Jovovich wakes up in the shower with a temporary case of amnesia.  She starts looking through the drawers in the room and you can almost picture ""There is nothing of interest here"" printed across the bottom of the screen.  For the horror fans in general there are some nice shock tactics used at times and the creatures are really well done.  It's very worth seeing.
As plot goes, the premise for the movie is better than the final movie turned out to be.  The main story revolves around an artificial intelligence system that exterminates the entire staff of an underground biochemical lab when one of there super-virus' secrets is compromised.  A team of soldiers, sent in by the Umbrella Corporation, is sent in to uncover why the A.I. system malfunctioned and to shut it down.  A single agent (Milla Jovovich) and her partner/husband, were in charge of guarding the secret entrance to the underground lab and are both left with no short term memory about the incident.  As the story is told the plot twists somewhat, but the overall feel of the movie is that it's been done before.  Several of the characters line up to be ""next to die"" in a series of creative deaths that parallel ""The House on Haunted Hill.""  The one outstanding thing that I did like about the story was the way the movie ended.  I won't give away anything, but the way the ending was filmed left you craving for a sequel.  At the same time, it didn't feel like this particular movie ended early either.
The special effects alone, make up for any monotony in the story-line.  There are several shots that reminded me of ""The Matrix"" and ""Swordfish.""  The living dead dogs were very realistic looking and the zombies makeup and costume design was very good.  Milla Jovovich was absolutely beautiful in her role and her supporting cast was very well chosen, although without a lot of star appearances.
The scenery throughout the movie gave it a very creepy feel.  Even though the movie takes place in a high tech office building, it gave off a very haunted house feel to the picture.  Marilyn Manson's scored songs added greatly to the eeriness and would be a great addition to any haunted house.
All in all a good movie to see, but not necessarily one to watch again and again.  And in my mind, if you combined the start of ""House on Haunted Hill"" with the ending of ""Resident Evil"" you'd have a near perfect horror movie.
The Breakdown:
1.  Plot- 8 (solid story with a few twists)
2.  Characters- 7 (nice main character, but supporting cast was very cookie cutter in nature)
3.  Flow- 8 (movie seemed to be moving on a different time frame than the characters were)
4.  Atmosphere- 10 (very creepy scenery and music)
5.  Cinematography- 10 (awesome special effects)
6.  Entertainment factor- 9 (kept you paying attention with no real slow spots)
7.  Replay factor- 7 (watch again for the effects but the story is a once in a while type movie)
8.  Casting/character depth- 8 (Good casting for roles, but not a lot of character detail)
9.  Relevance to genre- 8 (Atmosphere and the ending made this a good horror movie)

2449705,5,B000BYRCR4,"First of all, this is not an oscar-bound movie, so don't expect it to be anything it's not.  It's an excellent horror/sci fi thriller that kept me at the edge of my seat from start to finish.  Just turn off your brain and let the zombies munch on it for awhile and have some fun.  Don't think too hard about plot holes and such :-)  Resident Evil is truly frightening, and is one of the few movies that actually made my heart pound in fearful anticipation.  The movie is excellent at creating a kind of clausterphobic panic that really gets to the audience.  And yes, there are more zombies than you can shake a stick at.  And just when you thought there couldn't be any more zombies...
  The plot is engrossing and well-developed; the transition from video game to movie was very well made, compared to most.  The dual-""enemy"" of the A.I. supercomputer ""Red Queen"" and the zombies add two layers of horror to the film.  And of course, I have to agree with a previous reviewer that indeed, Milla Jovovich is HOT.  There's no getting around that.  She goes through the entire movie wearing a ridiculously [pretty] red dress which she didn't need to be wearing, but you don't hear me complaining.  Milla can look beautiful and kick zombie-[back side] at the same time.  The fact that the gorgeous Ms. Jovovich plays the main character certainly doesn't hurt the movie's enjoyablity for the male audience.",1016928000,2,1402,4.642276422764228
2449706,5,B000BYRCR4,"For not being faithful to the game, this movie was suprisingly great. This is the kind of movie where you get SO envolved in it that when it's over, you're just sitting there thinking 'man, that was just...WOW.' I was so shocked that it was so GOOD. I mean, when alot of people go to see a movie based on a game, they basically think 'you just wait, this is gonna be corny with no real plot.' Well, I THINK NOT! Of course, you know there's gonna be alot of critics out there that are going to terribly underrate RESIDENT EVIL. Take my advice, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR [comments]. I am so fed up with critics! What do they know? When YOU see a movie, YOU judge if YOU like it or not. EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT TASTES IN WHAT MOVIES THEY LIKE. Ok, enough said about that.
Milla Jovovich's acting alone is worth seeing this movie. She is, without a doubt, an amazing actress. The rest of the cast were really great as well.
The plot couldn't have been better. It's exciting and at the same time enjoyable. It's very hard to loose interest. I didn't mind the cliffhanger ending because I know there's gonna be a sequel.
I do have a warning. I usually don't put warnings in my reviews, but I think I should in this one. Ok, to start off, I saw RESIDENT EVIL on the day it released. I noticed that alot people were bringing in some very young children to see this movie. I'M TALKING ABOUT 5 AND 6 YEARS OLD!!! PLEASE people, use your heads!! OK, I think I got my point across.
WARNING: For people who are not familiar with or have never heard of the game, RESIDENT EVIL has strong scenes of violence and gore (not for the weak stomache). THERE ARE SOME DISTURBING DEATHS and alot of (well, of course) frightning scenes.
Overall, the movie is fantastic. The acting is top-notch, the plot is excellent with a suprising twist and the graphics are great.
So, if you're a fan of the game or horror/thriller movies, see this as soon as you can. I'm definitely gonna see it again. I can't wait till they release it on DVD!

2449707,2,B000BYRCR4,"It's been six years since I have run out of a movie theater angry and bewildered.
This review is really intended for the mature movie-goer. I say this because many of the young adults loved this movie and were having a blast.  I only wish I could have seen what they found so interesting. But hey, I gave it a go.  Even though the critics hate this movie(if you want a real laugh, check out Roger Ebert's review),  the trailer was intoxicating.
If you want to know, in depth what the movie is about..see another reviewer's review.  I'll just say here that the plot of an underground, highly classified colony of people, working on unnatural forms of DNA was exciting. When one little vial gets dropped, the computer system shuts the plant down, literally. Everyone is killed to contain the contamination.  The first 50 minutes were decent, but when really awful and unconvincing zombies jumped out of the woodwork, the movie could not redeem itself (think of zombies from knock-off flicks of the original ""Night of the Living Dead""). This is when 11 or more people, including ourselves walked out of the theater.
  There was rumor that this movie is based on a PC game of the same title.  I play many PC games and would appreciate if someone would email me and elaborate.  If this is true, that could be the reason why the younger crowd was so enthusiastic about this flick.
I give the movie two stars for suspense, a great initial plot, and choosing Milla Jovovich as the lead. I enjoy her acting, she is blossoming into a great actress.  In all, this movie felt like a combination of ""Aliens"", ""Ghosts of Mars"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", and ""Relic"".  It's a mish-mash of many great film ideas...but the ridiculous zombies were the movie's downfall. If they were more realistic, and frightening, instead of laughable, the movie might have succeeded.",1016928000,3,1854,4.708978328173375

2449710,4,B000BYRCR4,"I just got home from seeing this movie and I must say that it was far better than I had expected.  Having seen other movies like ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Mortal Kombat"", I knew that the whole movie-based-on-a-video-game was a really tough genre to incorporate.
That being said, this movie surpassed all my expectations and limitations that had been placed on it.  It was more of a prequal than a direct tie-in on the game level.  The movie answers some questions and provides some background on the games and universe.
We find out what the ""licker"" is and where it comes from.  The whole problem with the mansion being filled with zombies is explained, and more background on the Umbrella Corp. and the T-virus is given as well.
Although the movie is not an edge-of-your-seat nail-biter, it does include a fair share of ""jumpy"" places and some awesome special effects.  The acting is good, and I think that this is one role that Milla Jovovich shines in.  Sure, this movie isn't going to be up for any Oscar or award, but it is still worth watching.
The only thing that I am not pleased with is the ending.  Sure, it leaves the possibility open for sequals and thing of that nature, but I really don't like the way it just leaves you hanging.  Some resolution to the plot and the Nemesis Program would have been nice, but we all can't have everything.

2449711,5,B000BYRCR4,"I watched Resident Evil last night and I have to agree with most of you about being the best game to movie adaptation ever.  With a budget of forty million, I think Anderson did an excellent job.  I would've liked a bit more gore, but let's not forget the Dead movies that RE is being compared to were made a few years before graphic violence in movies was an issue.  I didn't expect to see exploding heads, although I would've liked to have seen at least one.  I jumped a few times watching the movie and that's something that hasn't happened for a long time.  How can you do anything new with zombies?  Give them wings?  Give them personality?  They're the walking dead for gods sake!!!  The time frame of the movie does fit in with the time frame of the games.  The movie takes place before the first game and the end of the movie takes place after the first game.

2449714,3,B000BYRCR4,"I could rant about the wooden performances by everyone but Jojovich (who might grow into the character Alice if they let her).
I could rant about the sloppy story and poor editing.
I could rant about the laser chamber scene, which had the potential to scare the beejeezus out of you but instead left you saying ""what just happened?"".
I could rave about the ending, which was about the only thing besides the 'Lurkers' that was dead-on.
I could rant about the blatant 'Dead' rip-offs.
But what I'm here to speak on is the zombies.
Regardless of the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of these creatures, we all know zombies in cinema eat human flesh. And we all know when you rip someone's guts out of them, they bleed profusely. Plus, you see guts. And we all know that when a zombie takes a chunk out of your carotid artery, you should be shooting bright red fountains.
Not to mention they're sloppy eaters, so you would expect, um, 'leftovers' over the floor.
Why am I getting into all this detail? Because every horror buff knows that's what happens when zombies eat. How do we know this? Becuase Romero, Fulchi and company have taught us so. And now you want to pass this [stuff] off as horror? Please. The game is far more realistic, with the asdded bonus of a more believable plotline.

My friend, although he wasn't familiar with the video game's plot, came out of the movie theatre almost drooling over the possibility of a sequel.  After seeing it I have to admit that although it has aspects from the 1st, 2nd, and even the introduction of the 3rd game none of the characters in the movie are in the video game series --- just yet...  This alteration the the games' storyline makes the movie even better because even though it's not a carbon copy of the game the storyline within itself is much more interesting (and revealing) than the actual games.

2449717,3,B000BYRCR4,"I don't get to watch television much, so, it's rare I see any previews for movies. However, a movie being made out of one of Playstation's better games, Resident Evil, shouldn't have evaded me before it was released. I mean, I know that their making new Halloween and new Friday the 13th movies.
Resident Evil is based off of the video game. It has an almost no-name cast, with an exception to Michelle Rodriguez, that you may remember from the Fast and the Furious. It incorporates aspects of the Matrix, in fact one seen where the main star, Milla Jovovich, is battling Zombie Dogs, she runs up a wall and performs nearly verbatim the same move that takes place in scene one from the Matrix. There is even a slow motion bullet scene at the end of the movie. The acting wasn't top notch. In fact, it left a bit to be desired, and the script wasn't done very well either. The only redeeming factor is that it had top notch sound effects and a lot of cool independent scenes. Such as the defense mechanism of lasers that the computer has. That part was cool, but again, it was stolen from another Keanu Reeves film, Johnny Mnemonic. So, the special effects are almost primitive now.
Overall the movie was good. Worth seeing in the theatre simply for the sound effects. I enjoyed it. I may buy it. There is going to be a sequel. Hopefully it's better.",1016668800,2,1349,4.465587044534413

It's pretty much exactly what you would expect- Lack of a good plot plus little character development, but hey, I've seen worse. This movie is a lot of fun though, with plenty of scares plus some nice visual effects and set designs, this movie is at the very least worth seeing if you are any kind of horror fan, I think any fan of the games would love it, I sure did. Speaking of the games, it does remain faithful although there aren't any of the characters you've seen in them, except for the monsters of course.  It's the same old plot of the games though, in fact it is set up a lot like them so it will also be very familier to Resident Evil fans. There a few things I would have changed though. For one the characters didn't seem very real, they didn't really have a story to them, so you can't really care about them or if they die or not. Plus the ending was a little disapointing and was kind of a tease, I expected a little more to happen, but I guess I'll have to wait again for the sequal, although the last thirty seconds was very nice indeed! One last thing... the gore factor, there should have been more! Seems a little silly but it is what the games are known for, I mean the movie got an R rating! Not that there isn't enough gore and violence but there were times in the movie where you expected to see it but didn't. Anyway this movie is still worth seeing, don't expect an oscer winning masterpiece, but expect a lot of mindless fun with plenty of good scares, kind of like the game? Almost. It also is the only movie based on a video game that ends up being well worth it in the end!

Just look at the previews, even they look like a disaster. Why make an action film this bad and THEN give it a theatrical release? Still curious? Here is the movie in a nutshell, its a very simple formula folks: throw in every tired action/horror/scifi film cliche, add an annoying heavy metal music soundtrack, base the 'plot' on a boring/simplistic computer game (kill the zombie, find a key, open the door using the key, repeat), add plenty of gore and a hoochie female lead and mix.

2449730,5,B000BYRCR4,"First let me say how it never ceases to amaze me how people can review books, games, dvds, music, etc. BEFORE they are released.  To the people who ask ""where are the zombies?"", HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOVIE????  Your reviews were written anywhere from a week to well over a month PRIOR to the films release.  So, a job well done to all of you.
The film itself, in my opinion, is one of the best entries into its genre in years.  The film succedes exceptionally in its intent: to be a great action/horror film.  Lets remember that nobody ever claimed that this was for Oscar consideration.
The acting by Milla Jovovich, who overall is an exceptional actress, is excellent.  The supporting cast, from Eric Mabius, who was the title character in The Crow: Salvation, to Michelle Rodriguez, who started in Girlfight, was commendable.
The score of rock and heavy techno, produced by Marilyn Manson, is suprisingly good, after his subpar contributions to the Spawn and Not Another Teen Movie soundtracks.  It worked well with the horror elements to create a creepy mood and was great during the intense action scenes.
The direction by Paul Anderson is excellent.  Anderson is an underrated director of such films as Boogie Nights and Magnolia, as well as the above average sci-fi film Event Horizon, and what is generally considered to be the best video game based film thus far, Mortal Kombat (yes, that includes Tomb Raider).  Anderson's direction on this film is in the music video style, jolty and quick, which serves the picture perfectly.
The special effects and computer graphics certainly are NOT the grade-B some people have made them out to be.  Lets remember that this is a 40 million dollar production.  The makeup on the zombies is great, the zombie dogs look great, and the CG Licker looks excellent.  Every monster is faithfully recreated to look like those in the game.  The special effects are just as good as any major sci-fi movie.
Now, about the complaints of the lack of human zombies, DID WE SEE THE SAME MOVIE??? or are you still basing your review on the trailer??
As far as the lack of main characters from the games, I thought that that was a great decision.  It makes the events fresh and unpredictable.  After all, this was a movie ""based"" on a video games, not an ""adaptation"" of the game.  Sure, the characters were underdeveloped, but the film gave you enough information on the main character, played by Jovovich, to understand her motivation and the role which she played in what had happened.
Also, the compliants about the lack of gore, are completely unfounded.  There is as much blood and gore as the director could push for without recieving an NC-17 rating, which is a decent amount.  Just wait for the DVD.
As for the plot being A) too complex (WHAT?) or B) too predictable, I greatly disagree with both.  Come on, the sole purpose of one of the characters, before he was ""disposed of"", was to explain the role of The Umbrella Corp., the Hive, and the Red Queen.  Too complex?  Judging the grammar in your review, I suppose it was.  Too predictable?  Perhaps in some parts, but not often and not laughably so by any means.  Ultimately, the plot is different than that of any of the games, but as an original story, it is well done and very much in vein with the games.  I never once shuttered over a corny, cheap line of dialogue.
As a really big fan of both video games and Resident Evil itself, I, as most of you do, get really mad at horrible video game based movies.  Not so with Resident Evil.  This movie is loud, stylish, action packed, and scary at times.  I had a blast during the film, never once feeling bored.  In my opinion, Resident Evil is the best video game movie made so far, and a great action/horror movie period.  And WOW what an ending.",1016496000,6,3787,4.608955223880597

I was REALLY wrong.  Don't get me wrong, because I don't scare easily. This movie was amazing.  If you ever played the video game...don't expect anything...you will be taken by suprise no matter what.  So, just go in there as if you haven't even heard that name before.",1016496000,7,565,4.5

Everything about the movie, from camera angles & effects to actor performances to creative death-scenes was right on.  It was upbeat and intense, while maintaining a certain level of class; no cheap gore just thrown in to gross you out!

I have played all the ""Resident Evil"" games on PlayStation and I thought that the film version definitely lived up to the games in a big way! ""Resident Evil"" takes place in a future city called Raccoon City. A lethal virus has been released inside a medical facility building called the Umbrella Corporation, killing everyone in sight and shutting down elevators, etc. The main character is a woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich, ""The Fifth Element""), who is teamed up with a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez, ""The Fast and The Furious"") to find the cause of everything that went on inside the complex...but not before some flesh-eating, virus-infected zombies come chasing after them! And the movie goes on from there. A lot of the credit goes to Screen Gems, part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, for bringing this movie to the big screen. Also to Milla Jovovich for not just her performance, but for her physical abilities as well. I mean, you should have seen Milla fight off those virus-infected canines one-by-one! In fact, Milla kind of reminds you of Angelina Jolie in last year's ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"". And also to Michelle Rodriguez for her outstanding role as Rain, who is part of the commando team and to director Paul Anderson (""Mortal Kombat"", ""Event Horizon""), he did an outstanding job in directing his second video game adaption since ""Mortal Kombat""!

2449737,4,B000BYRCR4,"This movie is based on a video game that I have never played, so I can't comment on how the movie's plot follows the game.  When the movie starts, there is a really cool aspect to it.  A naked woman has just regained consciousness in her shower and can't remember anything.  The next few minutes are packed with action, and a team of military personnel take them to the Hive (an underground research lab).  Slowly each of them get filled in on the details of the mission.  What that mission is, you'll have to watch the movie (or e-mail me) for.
The movie goes along great.  The plot starts to materialize and things seem all right when all of a sudden the movie got derailed.  Right about the point where the first living dead is discovered is when the film started to take a downturn.  From then on it starts to resemble one of John Carpenter's films (particularly Ghosts of Mars.  They even have the requisite train scene at the end.  If you haven't seen this.  Don't.)  I was disappointed by this.
What I can say is that the lead actress Milla Jovovich gave it a good performance (as far as action flicks go), on top of being HOT.  Sure, being the femme fetale and kicking butt is cliche nowadays.  But you should see her in action.

Based on the wildly popular video game series, ""Resident Evil"" is an action-packed thriller starring Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element), Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast and the Furious) and Eric Mabius (Cruel Intentions) in a battle of good and evil, human versus computer, the living against the Undead.
Something terrible is lurking in the Hive, a vast underground genetic research facility run by the Umbrella Corporation, a faceless bio-engineering conglomerate. A deadly viral outbreak occurs, and in response, the Red Queen - a vast supercomputer that controls and monitors the Hive - seals the entire facility to contain the leak, killing all the trapped employees.
Alice (MILLA JOVOVICH) and Rain (MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ) must lead fellow commandos to isolate the virus that has wiped out Umbrella's entire research staff. The team soon discovers, however, that the workers are not really dead. They are now the ravenous Undead, and they are prowling the hive. One bite or scratch from an Undead causes infection and worse, instant transformation into their kind.
Alice and the military task force have three hours to complete their mission before the virus threatens to overrun the Earth. To access the Red Queen, the team must pass through a series of increasingly horrifying obstacles in the maze-like hive. These include deadly lasers, mutant dogs and a vast specimen room where Alice witnesses the results of Umbrella's evil experimental research. Alice soon discovers that the
former humans are the ghastly result of Umbrella's latest project gone awry -- the T-virus.
Initially designed to combat ageing and fight nerve-based diseases, the T-virus has the ability to reanimate dead cells. Alice realizes that an unknown saboteur has stolen the virus and freed it into the hive's atmosphere. That's how the outbreak occurred. Who would do such a thing,
and why?
Confronting the giant computer, Rain demands that she guide them to the surface. The Red Queen agrees, but insists that no one who is infected will be allowed to escape. Unless of course, they can find the Anti-Virus first. Standing in their way is a genetically mutated experiment that is now a vicious creature known as ""the Licker,"" bent on destroying them all. The Licker's strength increases with each victim it slays-making the team's job even more deadly.
""Resident Evil"" is scary, but not nightmare scary. The director did do a fantastic job in adapting this video game into a heart pounding action horror thriller. I was frightened and kept in suspense at all time. It gave me chills and it really made me jump. Everyone in the theaters was screaming and yelling. This movie definitely has the thrills to give you the chills. I recommend it to anyone who is a huge fan of the ""Resident Evil"" games or fan's of the horror genre.
I didn't gave the other star because I thought that maybe the movie could of have more monsters like the giant spiders from ""Resident Evil 2"" game. I still enjoyed this movie a lot. Also, if you do not know anything and are clueless about the ""Resident Evil"" games, don't worry, this movie will tell you the story. It is not necessary to play the games to understand the movie.
I loved this movie because it did scare me and it had plenty of action to really satisfy me. I hope you will too enjoy it as much as I did. And by the ending of this movie it looks like there will be a ""Resident Evil 2"" and it will take place outside the streets of Raccoon City.",1016409600,,3518,4.884615384615385
2449739,5,B000BYRCR4,"I have to say that I was worried that I would not understand the movie at all because I have never touched anything Resident Evil before.  I loved this movie.  Had I not known better, I wouldn't have known that this was a game first.  I was confused to the first minute, but so was everyone, I think.  Right after that the movie progressed in a confortable manner, not to mention startling every five minutes.  I now want to learn more about the Resident Evil world.  Please don't expect anything from this movie and just enjoy it as a movie...",1016409600,,544,4.39
2449740,3,B000BYRCR4,"I was nonplussed at first, of seeing yet another video game hit the cinemas. But I went anyway, when I saw one of the tv trailers, and found out Milla Jovovich playes our heroine Alice, and the film is directed by Paul Anderson, whose Mortal Kombat was surprisingly pleasant popcorn fare.
While the story is based on the game, the plot is really a prequel to the Nemesis story that is alluded to in the movie's final scenes.
In an opening sequence we are introduced to The Hive, an underground research facility where the clandestine arm of the medical mogul Umbrella Corporation practices it's illegal genetic experimentation-until a terrible virus is released into the air system.
Our main character Alice then wakes up in a shower stall, with no memory of why. She can't remember who or where she is either, so I was a bit confused until later in the story. Alice is then burst in upon by a team of SWAT types demanding her report. Then off we go through the Looking Glass House with Alice and the S.T.A.R.S. to find the Red Queen-a supercomputer who has locked down The Hive with all its occupants.
Our team must shut down the Red Queen, and escape from the Hive before it is sealed off from the outside forever. It is a simple plan, until we learn what Umbrella Corp.'s virus has made of the men and women who worked there.
Once the computer is shut down, the film becomes a full-fledged flesh-eating nightmare as our heroes try to escape. Alice reveals a side of herself she didn't know was there, which allows them to make progress and also realizes that one of their band doesn't really want to help them.
Milla Jovovich does very well in this action film. As Alice learns more about herself, she becomes a much more interesting figure that Jovovich manages to inject with some humanity. She also fights very convincingly.
Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius and James Purefoy all have meaningful roles and play them well, as do the other cast members.
Paul Anderson has made his best film yet, but has sacrificed much of the humanistic elements for action and gore. Still, they do survive. Technically, the film looks wonderful. The editing is dramatic, even though it really overuses the ""shock-you"" moments where things jump into frame and surprise you. The tension is real, and I jumped in my seat and chomped on my nails a few times. The Looking Glass House looks much like the game and the Hive sets are very claustrophobic as in Aliens. In fact, one scene is ripped right out of Aliens!
Paul W. S. Anderson still pushes the envelope when it comes to shock, gore and overall gruesomeness though. There were moments when I could not watch.
I did like it though. It does not aspire to do anything more than scare you and gross you out, but it is very effective. Not bad for what Michelle Rodriguez terms ""MTV, ADD"" filmaking.",1016409600,5,2833,4.623015873015873
2449741,4,B000BYRCR4,"You should see this movie. It is good enough to see at least once depending on taste. I plan on seeing it a second time in the theatre for anything I missed while I was cringing in my seat. (which wasn't much--but I really liked this movie)
I am really getting annoyed with the bad reviews this movie is getting though. Some of the reviewers trash the movie always referring to the Alice in Wonderland theme and Anderson's past film credits (Mortal Kombat). Now tell me honestly...how many times was Alice's (Milla) name even mentioned? How many times was the mansion referred to as Looking Glass House? Not many. So why complain about that tid bit? And as far as original...what HAS been original in horror films lately? Most everything in one fashion or another has been done or copied. So just enjoy the ride. Sit back and let it take you because it DOES.
I am sure that while it seems a little odd, Anderson wanted this to be kind of like Alice down the rabbit hole scenerio. Who wouldn't be feeling that way in this situation?
I thought that this movie (the game series aside) was very eye stimulating and chilling. The zombies were a little...well they could have been scarier or something but they're zombies not mutant zombies so what do you expect?
From the opening scene in the elevator that was pretty heart stuttering to a confused, upset, and nearly nude Milla in the middle of Racoon City. I was really excited to see the end scene because it has the feel of a sequel and perhaps this movie being sort of a PREQUEL to the game kind of thing, we'll see more of what we wanted to see when we thought this was the first game in the series. (It will just be RE2 that's all)
I would like to see a sequel. No doubt about it. It got jolts and scares out of me despite reading the scorn and criticism I'd read before seeing the movie. I mean-- I liked Aliens, I liked The Cube, I like zombies and freaky scenes. The red queen was pretty neat and I thought Milla and Michelle rocked. So if you enjoy just a good scare flick and can leave some of the scorn people are throwing around out of it--you will have a good time.",1016409600,,2125,4.341708542713568
2449742,1,B000BYRCR4,"The way the movie started I thought it was gonna rock...Boy was I wrong. First of all, Resident Evil as a game was scary and had lots of gore and blood. As a movie that was rated ""R"", it didn't even stand up to the video game in that aspect. The movie should have been PG-13. Come on! This is supposed to be RESIDENT EVIL, not Scooby Doo! The Blair Witch was scarier AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE WITCH! If they intend on making a sequel, I suggest going all out for it, but please don't be afraid of using more blood and gore...Remember this is the year 2002!  If they need to go for NC-17, then have at it!",1016409600,4,606,4.008264462809917
2449743,4,B000BYRCR4,"You may think I am crazy ,but I tell you I couldn't get Resident Evil out of my head. Most of the elements of Resident Evil you may have seen in better movies ,but it does grow on you. Resident Evil, one of the most popular playstation games ever, has now been given the big screen treatment in this Big, Buff, and gory flick. Even though it lacks plot and characterization and it is not as gross as the video games and still is the best 2hrs of entertainment you will ever have. Using material from movies like Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, and Aliens(All Highly Recommended) Resident Evil will make you jump, scream, laugh, and hurt your ear drums with its driving load soudtrack. Special Effects are dazzling and is as fun as a 3 ring circus,this film is full of the big budget studio entertainment you see constantly in scifi/horror movies today. So for those nerds out their (like me!) who love scifi conventions, and dig (NO-BRAINER) zombie flicks this is the one to see!!! I think fans of the video games will not be too disappointed do to their dissisions to not use Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield from the original video game and not using the plotlines from the game as well. Anyways the bottom line is : Loud, fast, scary, and gross sells and is the amount of jolt Resident Evil has to offer for Horror junkies! Now already I have the DVD, I can't wait till director Paul Anderson finishes his script ""Resident Evil 2: Nemesis"" and starts production!",1016409600,,1488,4.4944649446494465
2449744,1,B000BYRCR4,"""Good special effects"" seemed to be the only positive thing anyone had to say about this movie.  From start to finish, the movie did nothing to make you feel either for or against any of the characters, except perhaps for tantalising glimpses of Milla Jovovich's anatomy.  The entire movie seemed like an endless repetition of a 90 second sequence: create a spooky setting with an opportunity for special effects to go overboard, build an ""it's almost too quiet"" sense of normalcy, then introduce some grotesque horror and put a bang in the soundtrack to make it seem like everyone's jumping due to the amazing build-up of tension.
I tried to think of a worse movie, but apparently I've either repressed all such experiences, or this is genuinely the worst movie I've ever seen.  It's probably not... oh - no... in fact, it definitely isn't.  There was one film that I've seen that was worse: ""Powder"", which one reviewer dubbed ""the best supernatural albino film ever made"".  Ah well - this film didn't even make the best of the worst... just plain lame.",1016323200,2,1055,4.774725274725275
2449745,4,B000BYRCR4,"Is it a movie masterpiece? Well, no. But ""Resident Evil"" still satisfies the most important movie requirement - it's fun. It's designed for the same audience that enjoys hack & slash video games, and in that regard, it succeeds totally. I suspect the critics who can't understand this are the same ones who actually think trivial pop-culture [movies] like ""American Beauty"" really do deserve Best Picture awards...",1016323200,,414,5.1940298507462686

Eerie environments (like the spooky quiet rooms in the game), monsters that pop around corners, as well as the good ole blood and gore that accompany any resident evil game fill this movie.

2449747,5,B000BYRCR4,"Well last nite I went to go see the movie and I enjoyed the movie beyond belief. Because it related to the game. I can not stand people who do not understand it and give it bad reviews, in most cases it is because they haven't played the game. Seeing the graphics of this movie was great, personally I liked the twist in the story and the evolving stages of a licker to a hunter. It keeps you wanting more and I cannot wait to see part two if they come out with one. The plot behind this movie was excellent and people who disagree are those who haven't played the game. To a gamer it was great to a new person who was trying to compare it to Night of the living dead need to go home, this was another type of movie horror yes but entertaining and yet kept to the game, unlike other movies (Tomb Raider). During the movie u wanted to see more of the game come out, in the theater all u heard if u were surrounded by RE or in japanese (bio-hazard) fans was when is Tyrant or Nemesis going to show. To the people who made the movie I think it beats any other game movie cross over and congrats.",1016323200,,1092,4.0368663594470044
2449748,5,B000BYRCR4,"The Resident Evil series is by far the best RPG game to ever hit the video game circuit.  So when I heard the movie was going to be made ... I was excited.  But ... I've read reviews of what the movie was going to be about and the road they were taking on the concept and storyline, then it occured to me that the movie was going to be very bad.  I thought it was going to be another B monster movie with a popular title slapped onto it.  I saw it on opening day and I'm glad to say that those reviews weren't correct and the movie was awesome.  There was so much of the video game that was in the movie.  I would say 80%, maybe more.  There are plenty of hungry flesh eating zombies to creep you out, zombie dogs, a crazy supercomputer, the T-virus, and the licker.  The main star Alice (Milla Jovovich) reminds me so much of Jill Valentine from Capcom's ""Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"" that the movie makers could of just named her Jill.  But I guess they wanted to have different characters in the movie.  By the way, she is hot.  In any case, the movie is especially great for fans of the game, but also can be enjoyed by horror fans as well.  ""Resident Evil"" definately has a lot of heart stopping moments that can raise the dead and I would recommend this to you, Resident Evil fans and to you zombie lovers worldwide.",1016323200,,1319,4.169960474308301
2449749,4,B000BYRCR4,"Well, here it is another video game movie destined to follow in the path of Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, and other laughable adaptations of video games.  But wait, Resident Evil is good, very good.  I was expecting a hackneyed story with horrible dialogue and characters.  But instead I got a movie that brings back wonderful memories of the first game and the huge mansion and baddies.  It was all very nostalgic.  This movie is made for fans of the game pure and simple, anyone else isn't going to get it, there are lots of references to certain game elements.  Many characters from the game make an appearence, the zombies, the ""licker"", and even the ravens make a brief appearence.  There is even a slight reference to the nemesis program.  I read many reviews that tore into this movie for being implausible and ridiculous.  But these reviewers failed to take into account one thing.  Anyone going to a Resident Evil movie who knows the game is going to realize that B-movie schlock is part of the fun of RE.  The horribly stilted dialogue in the first game was unforgettably bad.  Not to say that the movie has anything that bad, the acting is actually rather good, especially Milla who really impressed me.  The best thing I have to say though, is that there is enough of the plot of the game to bring back pleasant memories of the game, but not too much so that it looks like I'm just watching the game in movie form.  That was a tightrope to walk, and I think it was pulled off admirably.  The direction was rock solid, there were far too many ""boo"" moments at the beginning, but thankfully that quickly faded.  There seems to be ample room for a sequel so I hope this movie does good business so I can see another one, because I'll be first in line.",1016323200,,1758,4.481132075471698
2449750,5,B000BYRCR4,"This movie is simply awesome. The whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. Even in the parts where you know something is going to happen it still makes your hart beat faster and makes you jump out of your seat. The music even helps to add to the creepy factor. If you ask me it is one of if not the best horror movie in awhile, if not one of the best movies all together.
Now the plot of this movie is as follows. Umbrella company is the biggest corporation and its products are in almost every home, but they do have a secret source of income doing illegal viral experiments and bio weaponry experiments. These experiments are done in an underground secret lab called the Hive. When a vial of the T virus breaks the Red Queen(the computer that runs the Hive's security systems) kills all the people in the Hive. A special team is sent in to see what happened. They go in using the entrance in the mansion above the Hive. Here they find another women that was supposed to guard the hive she was knocked out by the gas the the Red Queen had relased. Also they find someone posing to be a cop he is really some one trying to uncover Umbrella. So they head down to the Hive via a train. On the train they find another man who was also knocked out by the gas. He is another guard from the mansion who was supposed to be married to the woman as cover when they were living in the mansion. Now that the get down there they eventually come to a hallway where 4 of the team members die because of a laser beam that cuts them up. The still living people go into the room that controls the Red Queen. After the Red Queen tries to scare them off by telling the that they are all going to die they turn her off which unlocks all the doors which let the zombies out. Now the team must fight for there lives to escape this place before the get locked in beacause the mansions entrance door closes by itself after a period of time. They find out all this stuff about the woman and guys they had found on the way down. It turns out that one of them (i am not going to tell which one so you have to see the movie) had something to do with the incident. Well in the end it turns out they all did. Go see it to find out the rest.
This movie is really gory so if you don't like that kind of stuff don't even think of going. Now if you like being scared out of your seat then I highly recommend this movie.",1016323200,2,2392,4.048523206751055
2449751,4,B000BYRCR4,"First let me start off by saying I never played the ""Resident Evil"" video games. I never even heard of Jill Valentine until I played ""Marvel Vs Capcom 2"" for my SEGA Dreamcast. But my older brother, the ""Resident Evil"" savant, has been filling me in on the games storyline since we first heard about Constantin Films making this into a movie.
Then came the trailer, which made the flick look like an ""Aliens,"" ""Matrix,"" ""Day of The Dead"" rip off equipped with the obligatory kick [all] babe in a dress and a Matrix style super kick to a Doberman. Needless to say I thought this was going to be the most worthless movie ride ever.
But the movie is actually quite good. I went to a 12:15am showing in Manhattan and to my surprise it was packed. But my older brother quickly filled me in and told me that ""Resident Evil"" is one of the most popular games ever, spawning many sequels and remakes. That explained the fanatic geek contingent in the front row. The movie starts off like a video game which is fitting, a back story about the Umbrella Corporation being the largest corporation with most of their products in every home in the world.
The movie then starts with a dynamic opening sequence inside the hive and does not stop. I was told the first game was set in a mansion. This mansion is just in the flick for all about maybe 5 minutes of screen time, because all the action takes place inside the hive. I was also told that none of the characters in Resident Evil: The Game are in the movie. Milla Jovovich plays an amnesiac named Alice who wakes up inside the mansion not knowing how she got there, of course we find out that she is a commando for the Umbrella Corporation. We then meet a squad of commandos who have a mission to enter the hive and stop the Red Queen. Milla joins them for the ride into the hive.
The Red Queen is the hives central computer and she has gone in spaz mode sealing the hive shut because of the T-Virus contaminating the air vents and infecting the hives employees.
Note, if you are expecting a Romero style zombie flick don't see Resident Evil. The zombies are merely a plot device to scare, or bite someone. That did not bother me because I know with today's jacked rating system, a flick like ""Dawn of the Dead"" would never be released. The flick is packed with plenty action. Sure the film borrows from the flicks I mentioned above but who cares. I was enjoying it, and the audience was too.
The flick doesn't have much acting in it, just a lot of action and ... whooping. Milla Jovovich is capable as an action heroine. And she is far superior to the acting of Ms. Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie in last years debacle known as ""Tomb Raider."" A film I affectionately refer to as ""The Complete Piece of Crap I Saw For Free Last Summer And Still Wanted My Money Back."" Back to Resident Evil, Michelle Rodriguez expands on her resume of bad ... chicks with this flick, she offers the much needed action hero one liners because Milla spends most of the beginning of the flick regaining her memory. Eric Mabius is cool, and looks to be seeing more of the RE franchise. Did I say Franchise? Yeah guys there will be a sequel, the cool epilogue at the end sets it up and had the audience fired up.
The Good:
Action, Set Design, The Monster at the end, Evil Dobermans, The Beginning, The Laser Sequence, and The Ending.
The Bad:
Does not follow the sequence of events in the games, i.e., The Train from RE2 is in this one. Too many scenes in which the director tries to scare you. With a hand here and a zombie there. The film is good enough without those things, it feels strained, like he's trying to make it up to the fans for the fact that Romero was thrown off the project. It's like he was trying to prove he can make a scary flick.
In closing, the film is not a waste of time. Go see it, it is quite good. You have to take it for what it's worth. Mindless fun in the vain of flicks like ""The Fast and the Furious."" My brother left the theater and admitted he wanted to hate the flick so bad. But he couldn't. He enjoyed it and said that it will get a bad rap from rabid fans, the same stupid fans who were [upset] that the X-Men dressed in leather, or that the 1st Episode 2 trailer was too lovey dovey.
One thing about this movie that does [upset] is it's release date. Why couldn't it come out in early January and pummel that god awful Britney flick or the music video also known as ""Queen of the Damned""? Now it won't have time to breathe with ""Blade 2"" coming out next week, and ""The Scorpion King"" coming out soon after.",1016323200,5,4570,4.308943089430894
2449752,5,B000BYRCR4,"I personally have never played the video game, but I have to say that I was really impressed with this movie.  It is very suspenseful, and full of surprises.

A must see for thrill seekers!",1016323200,,339,4.557377049180328
2449753,4,B000BYRCR4,"The movie follows the continuity of the games, making references to people that are in the center of the Ashford family, owners of the UMBRELLA corp. that appear in the R.E. games as well as Nemesis and even down to the detail of the Umbrella special-ops teams uniforms reminiscent of Hunk in R.E. 2. If you like the games you should like the movie. As a prequel to the games the movie provides answers to some of the mystery and questions that arise as a result of playing the game. The movie plays off of the games success by using the same style of camera angles as well as using common characteristics, i.e. that design of dress all too many R.E. characters own, or the bizzarre messages that people with temporary amnesia find and only discover the meanings later. The movie lacks most of the other biohazard mutations, containing only zombies, zombie dogs, lickers (the long tongued clawed thing from the 2nd game with an exposed brain), and a glimpse of pre-Resident Evil 3 NEMISIS. The movie uses lots of inventions pulled from the games, such as the underground train in RE gun survivor. The camera angles while meant to bring suspense get overly repetitious, with several close ups of people who suddenly get surprised, or close ups of zombies suddenly opening their eyes. The movie is a little on the predictable side but only as much as the games. A misconception is that the original games, and thus the movie, while horror in nature were meant to imitate and satirize the old style of B-movie horror, and the movie is the same way, the whole Resident Evil series is meant to be a farce of the whole 50's style of horror in a modern setting. Most people don't realize this and expect to see a terrifying movie, while scary there is subtle twisted humor to the series, I mean evil international corporation with a virus turns people into zombies that eat the flesh of the living. Hmmm... sounds funny to me, just as much as an asteroid from space bringing bacteria that cause the dead to come to life. The movie is good and follows the same tone of the games, the movie was meant for people who like the games, the storyline, the characters, and the plot are a variation of the plots and characters of the games, which are a variation of the classic horror sci-fi genre. If you go into the movie with this in mind you will be frightened and will enjoy it just as much.",1016236800,5,2380,4.524361948955916

While the storyline stuck with the games very well, it also was done in a way to entertain anyone who has never played the games. The action starts at the beginning and lasts to the end, leaving you gasping for breath and begging for more.  Some scenes actually had the audience applauding at their conclusions.
I so hope for a sequal.",1016236800,,542,4.577319587628866

I must say, I'm impressed, not only with the plot, which fits nicely into the whole RE storyline, but also the choice in actors, the visual effects, and of course, the ""jump"" factor.  It does help if you are familiar with the games (there are references to lickers, hunters, and the Nemesis), but if you like being scared, you'll like the movie.

I really enjoyed the movie. There is a girl who is reeeeeally ripped off of the ""tough chick"" in other survival horror movies, the movie rips off Dawn of the Dead (almost word for word at one point) and other movies stated here in other reviews, and it does not have the same feel at all as the game, but I can't help it -- Despite all my criticisms, I really enjoyed it. The music is really unique and I think contributes a lot to the overall mood. My main beef with the film is that it is not a movie about zombies, monster plants, hunters, lickers and tyrants and everything like the games are, but it is a movie about zombies. Zombies and one monster. Still, gotta love the zombie dogs, been waitin my whle life to see zombie dogs, lemme tell ya.

So if you really like horror flicks go see this.",1016236800,,266,3.9444444444444446
2449759,3,B000BYRCR4,"...I saw this beautiful gem of a movie on the opening night! Definitely the best video game adaptation to date so far for the big screen. While the acting and plot may not have been the strongest, it definitely left me entertained and eagerly awaiting the next installment. The information presented in the movie links the mansion with Raccoon City, as well as a decent description of how the T-Virus created the zombies after the squad arrived 6 hours onto the scene.
The initial confusion is a bit annoying, but once the flashbacks are experienced and the reason for the ""confusion"" are revealed you'll go, ""Ohh...I get it.""
The use of new characters on Anderson's part was brilliant as people couldn't figure out who lived and who died, if they didn't read any interviews with Paul anderson, the director. The use of special effects wasn't that much, as least not what the trailers show. Most of the SFX scenes are in the trailer, the rest is brilliant use of prosthetics and make-up, good ol'movie magic! For a movie done with such a low-budget, it sure as hell surprised me! Definitely recommend it if you are a hardcore RE fan or if you just want something to get your blood pumping. It'll be #1 in the box office for one week though, cause next week is 'Blade 2'...",1016236800,,1272,4.607929515418502
2449760,3,B000BYRCR4,"This movie is a action packed film based on the game resident evil by Capcom. This movie will keep u on the edge of ur seat the whole time . In the beginning it is a bit confusing but u will understand it a little later into the film it's about a virus (t-virus) gone bad and kills everyone in the umbrella company building which is under raccon city in a hive type of struture. All of the employes turn in the undead and rome the hive. Including killer dogs and other strange creatures!!!
A must see movie.",1016236800,,507,4.183673469387755
2449761,3,B000BYRCR4,"This movie was pretty cool. I'm a fairly big fan of the games, and I though it was well illustrated on film. The action was fast, the violence was gratuitous, and Milla Jovovich was sexy. ... Fun stuff. The zombies are creepy, and the licker (don't ask) is just plain freaky. Go see this flick. It's a fun time at the movies. ...",1016236800,,329,4.238095238095238
2449762,2,B000BYRCR4,"I was quite disappointed with this movie. The music is high quality teen fare (the youngsters seemed to like it). Don't have high expectations of the film however if you are a hard core horror/sci-fi fan. This is no ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Evil Dead"". Wait for the cable release - there is nothing in this film that can't be shown on cable.",1016236800,,339,4.3125
2449763,1,B000BYRCR4,"If I could vote in the minus catagory this would be a -10.
 This I guess is supposed to be a video game for those Tron's who really like this stuff. Using good actors, Milla Jovovich,(The Claim) and I swear on my sight, I saw (Hugh Jackman) 'X Men' in this movie, but he does not show up in the credits, and if that (was) him. It's no wonder he had his name taken off the credit line.
If plagiarism, is the basis of video games then this is loaded with borrowed material. I see, Alien's, Night of the living dead,and a few others.
Really folks save your money. Or go out on the back roads of America and look for road kill, its more exciting than this flick!!

2449764,5,B000BYRCR4,"I am an avid player of the Resident Evil games. I went into the theatre with low expectations, expecting yet another horrible video game-to movie translation. The moment the film starts though, you can tell it is nothing like the anything that has come before it.
Plot:
It takes less than a minute for all heck to break loose as the virus is released upon ""The hive""(an underground facility where the film takes place). The poor workers are trapped and we witness an intense and very sad series of scenes. Cut to above the complex where we meet out star, a beautiful young woman who can't remember who or where she is. In come the S.T.A.R.S members(the good guys) to save the day. They are here to see what went wrong at the Hive. All of this happens in only minutes...just hinting at how fast-paced this film is going to be. We meet many people, majority very likeable as they go deep into the Hive. The beauty of the film really comes out here. The film started so quickly and left so many things un-explained that we feel exactly like the lead. Everything is a mystery and every second of the film is part of the mystery unfolding.
What I think:
Now I won't give anymore away....the film does any amazing job of setting everything up, and slowly building up until the really scary stuff starts. Some of the acting at the start is a little off, but later the acting is great. You really start to care about the people, and when people die the way the characters react really gets to you. To top it off, this film has some of the best writing I've seen in a long time. I'm a writer so I'm usually very picky, but I was very happy with this films ability to surprise the audience. I see every horror movie, so I can always say what will happen next. In Resident Evil though, I had no idea what would happen. From opening scene to the completly amazing ending, I was susprirsed. There is even one specific scene that is so surprising, even after it happens you are still in dis-belief. By the time the film was over, everyone in our audience looked exhausted. I know I was. And if that still isn't enough, the movie fits perfectly in with the video games. Must you play the games to understand? No. People I saw it with have never played the games, but they still understood everything. However, if you have played the games, you will definitly appreciate the movie even more, if that's possible.",1016236800,22,2395,4.433106575963719
2449765,1,B000BYRCR4,"Ok, where do I start? The plot was dumb, the soundtrack was horrible, the acting was ridiculous, the zombies were even more ridiculous, there were splatter scenes thrown here and there to try to spice up the whole thing, and, finally, the spirit of the movie was sick. Could things get any worse than this?",1016236800,3,306,4.581818181818182
2449766,5,B000BYRCR4,i just saw the movie and all i ahve to say it was worth teh wait . of course its not exactly based on teh first game but tehy took the best parts of it and turned it into a great film not teh best but tehy did a dang good job cant wait for teh sequal.,1016236800,,251,3.4210526315789473
