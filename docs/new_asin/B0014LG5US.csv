8256001,2,B0014LG5US,"This bxw footage appears to have been shot, for the most part, while a female reporter was trying to get some straight answers from Dali, something he almost never gave. She gets justifiably frustrated at his nonsensical responses, rude actions and idiotic actions. The self-proclaimed ""Divine Dali"" was a showman through and through, but he was a very boring one most of the time and babbled gibberish. I was bored by most of this short film. At least there's no footage of him in his main self-described persona, ""The Great Masturbator."" That we don't need to see despite the fact that he did it often and got his entourage to join in -- as long as no one, especially any woman, touched him. I was very disappointed in this film that I got through Netflix. It's not worth the money by any means and only deserves one watching.",1399507200,,828,4.601351351351352
8256002,2,B0014LG5US,"I wish I hadn't seen this film.

It surrounds Dali's trip to NYC, during which he acts mostly like an over-grown badly behaved child seeking to drench an insatiable thirst for media attention.

It was probably because he knew there was a camera present that he acted so.

His behavior somewhat deminished my impression of him, which previously I'd only gained from viewing his work.

Other DVDs I've seen that focused more on his work, were much more informative.",1368403200,2,463,4.822784810126582
8256003,3,B0014LG5US,"This film is all in black and white. Mainly short, casual interviews with Dali, moving images over his paintings (again, in grainy black and white), and a few shots of Dali doing artsy things.

The beginning is mainly jerky (annoying now but perhaps edgy back then?) shaky camera angles of, you guessed it, Dali in New York. One un-expected surprise were the shots of parties and people talking which give you a glimpse into the art scene back when.

The DVD has no main menu (well, I couldn't find it), and I couldn't get subtitles to turn on. Dali spoke in a thick accent so it was hard to hear what he was saying (this is when I really wished there were subtitles). There is no narration and not THAT much talking going on in the first place so don't expect a lot of information to be passed onto you. The thing that makes this documentary great is WHEN it was made. But you don't really get a glimpse into who Dali is (Watch this, then watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bukowski-Born-Into-This/dp/B000E8N8L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bukowski - Born Into This</a>&nbsp;and you'll see what I'm talking about).

I did like how we saw Dali try to contrive these artistic experiences (with the egg/money/ants scene, crashing the sculpture onto the pavement, and insisting on that tiger/sphinx animal being around him) - I feel like that showed me the extravagances of the artist, specifically Dali's, mind. The film mentions Dali's admiration for science/molecules. The credits are cute with Dali drawing a scene to live music. 2.5 stars.",1229299200,3,1586,5.1395348837209305
8256004,5,B0014LG5US,"I watched this film at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and had to buy a DVD of it.  It is an amazing film that captures Dali at his most surreal.  He performs various art events, including being surrounded by a million dollars in cash while an egg containing huge black ants is broken on his face as the legendary photographer, Philippe Halsmann snaps away with his Hasselblad.  The black and white cinematography reminded me of Pennebaker and I discovered later that the cameraman, Jim Desmond, had been his protegee.  There is an energy to this film that carries it along and I was not bored for a moment.  It has a very '60s feel and the technique of the film reflects Dali's surreal creativity. After the screening at MOMA, to a full house, the audience was very appreciative, and a Japanese woman stood up and said the film had brought her true happiness and had changed her life.",1222128000,8,890,4.503105590062112
