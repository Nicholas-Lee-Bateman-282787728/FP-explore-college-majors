8407998,5,B003XF1V2U,"It is not a great film, but it features the now long lost Windmill Theartre and many of it's girls. A bit of nostalgia worth a look if that interests you.",1464048000,,154,4.0
8407999,5,B003XF1V2U,"I bought this because of Jon Pertwee (Doctor Who). Fun movie, kind of strange, and you get to see Pertwee do a Danny Kaye impersonation.",1420502400,,136,4.48
8408000,4,B003XF1V2U,"I bought this DVD to see some early work by Jon Pertwee, the sexy third Doctor Who. In Murder at the Windmill, Jon Pertwee plays a police sergeant, always browbeaten by his superior officer. The real joy of this film is the selection of musical and dance acts from the Windmill. There is no nudity, even in the tableau scenes, although that was not the case at the real Windmill. One scene shows the cast members dressed and made up to resemble Hollywood stars of the era of Veronica Lake.

Dont expect much from the mystery. Dont expect much from Jon Pertwee. Instead, enjoy watching the various vaudeville acts and the pretty women.",1402012800,,634,4.610619469026549
8408001,1,B003XF1V2U,"This is by far the worst mystery I have ever seen and I have seen plenty.  I could hardly make it to the part where the murderer was revealed because of the horrible songs throughout the movie.  Kept it playing while I did quick tasks in another room since there is no scene selection.  I enjoy mysteries old and new.  Doesn't matter whether they are American, British, Italian, etc. as long as they are interesting.  Murder at the Windmill is a waste of money and not worth even the actual twenty minutes it took to see ""who dun it.""  Consider yourself warned!",1384214400,,561,4.450980392156863
8408002,4,B003XF1V2U,"Val Guest is one of England's finest filmmakers. His body of work covers all main genres, their hallmark being solid storytelling, strong plots and well-rounded characters. Many of his films seamlessly combine humour and drama. ""Murder at the Windmill"" is such a film where the cast and crew of a play at the Windmill Theatre are detained while a police investigation is carried out into the murder of an audience member, apparently shot from the stage during a performance. A highlight is a humorous turn by a young Jimmy Edwards. Good mystery, good fun, not unlike the Miss Marple Movies of the '60s. My only quibble is this print is 15 minutes short of the film's original running time.",1366502400,,689,4.798319327731092
