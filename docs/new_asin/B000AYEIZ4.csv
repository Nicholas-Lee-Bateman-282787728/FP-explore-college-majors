2397854,5,B000AYEIZ4,Back when this program aired as a television special I videotaped it since both my sons and my elderly father loved this character. We watched it for several years and just about wore out the tape.  How great it is to be able to see this program again.  The print is in excellent condition with clear picture and sound.  What makes this one also special is the music written by Harry Nielsen.  To me this one is a collector's item.,1416268800,,431,4.35

2397859,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Loved it as a kid, still love it as an adult. DVD plays great on any player it's been in.

Ziggy's gift is a simple story, about a good guy that (unknowingly) almost gets into a big heap of trouble. Ziggy gets tailed by both a crook and a cop, but continues about his good deeds without realizing it. The crook learns a good lesson, and I think maybe the police officer does too. It's a short feature, but worth purchasing.",1412121600,,423,4.222222222222222
2397860,5,B000AYEIZ4,"I've always loved this movie, and when I bought it recently my nine-year old grandson...who wasn't sure he would like it...has watched it seven times already (almost in a row!).  It's an endearing Christmas treat for young and old.",1407715200,,231,4.923076923076923

It's a cute movie, with a good message that the whole family will enjoy. Love seems to be the theme and it's done very well. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially families with young children.",1390953600,,328,4.061538461538461
2397863,5,B000AYEIZ4,I first saw this back in 1984 and bought it on VHS tape.  Since we no longer have a VHS player (not to mention the tape is pretty worn out) we decided that we just had to get this on DVD.  We shared it with our grandkids and now we have another generation that love this movie.,1389225600,,277,3.8421052631578947

2397869,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Ziggy is my favorite cartoon characters and have loved this show for over 25 years. I have hunted for this at stores that sell dvd's and have not been able to find it. I like that the show is all about love and caring. I am so glad that I got this and have watched it almost 50 times, while at home recovering from back surgery. I would love to be able to get one more copy in case this one breaks some day.",1382832000,,407,3.857142857142857
2397870,5,B000AYEIZ4,"If you've never seen a Ziggy cartoon, or read a comic strip, this is the way to break into it. This silent star is funny, touching, and a little ""off"" but in a good way! And there isn't a person alive who won't have the theme song stuck in their head having them happily watch it again and again.

I got a used one though, but my only complaint is that the case is... from a library ahaha! But its the actual casing just pocked with stickers. But the disk is in very good condition.",1382054400,,482,4.073684210526316
2397871,5,B000AYEIZ4,"My family and I have watched Ziggy's Gift every Christmas for the past 30 years. We owned the VHS, then a DVD copy, which was lost during a move.

2397872,5,B000AYEIZ4,"To all the moms and grandmas out there, this short 35 minute Award winning Christmas cartoon is a must have for your little ones.  The messages throughout emphasize a beautiful morality that invokes not only a feeling of love and joy for life, but for the future of mankind in general.  I have shown this movie to my sons every Christmas when they were little in the VHS format, then bought it as a DVD since I had worn out the previous version.  My granddaughter will now grow up seeing this at grandma's house.  Ironically, my son (and her daddy) had also found the DVD version and bought it for her as well--that's the impact that this beautiful cartoon has on us all!  Ziggy is my all-time favorite cartoon character, and this film not only renews our belief in human kindness and forgiveness, but brings tears of joy as well.  This is a film for young and old alike, truly an emotional roller-coaster of the goodness we all have deep inside and our willingness to find the true meaning of Christmas beyond the material values.  This is not about religion, but a general outlook on goodness and human decency, so this film is good for all religious sects (or non-religious ones).  Just a feel-good film well worth the price to watch as a holiday tradition.  Definitely a must-see!  Love, love, love it!",1374364800,,1306,4.5905172413793105
2397873,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Great find as well, Every time I watch it with my son, I feel that I'm back in time. I see it through his eyes. A great time for kids... not the crap they have now. Every thing has a destiny. this tape is Old School... it's heavy and
two toned in color, The First tapes that came out. Why nobody brought this. it was meant for my son and me. 1983 packaging. Forever thanks to the person sold us this tape.

2397874,5,B000AYEIZ4,When my kids were young this show would come on every year with the Christmas shows.  My kids loved it.  Now they have kids and wanted them to see the special story Ziggy had to share.  I know they will love it as much as my kids did.,1373241600,,234,3.8333333333333335
2397875,5,B000AYEIZ4,"I was so happy to get this.  I remembered it from years ago when it used to come on with the Charlie Brown Christmas special.  Why they ever stopped showing it, I don't know.  Lucky for me I was able to get this for my DVD Christmas collection.",1355097600,,244,4.041666666666667
2397876,5,B000AYEIZ4,"As Christmas releases go--and I'm including movies, holiday episodes of TV series and TV specials like this one--it doesn't get better than ""Ziggy's Gift."" Beautifully-written and impeccably-animated, this very brief special from 1982 has humanity-affirming warmth that might and only MIGHT be topped by ""It's a Wonderful Life."" I even could argue that as an animated special, this is better than ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" which sounds like sacrilege even to my own ears. But it truly is that good and it's a shame that more people don't know about it or appreciate it.

It's impossible for me to watch this without having tears spill down my cheeks. Quietly wonderful with direct, though not mean-spirited, jabs at Christmastime avarice, it also shows that each of us has a shot at redemption from these ways. What could be more beautiful than that?",1353801600,,853,5.049645390070922
2397877,5,B000AYEIZ4,Ziggy's Gift is one of the all time great Christmas videos.  I own it and watch it with my family each Christmas.  I just purchased another one for my nephew and his wife who are newly weds and will be able to start their own Christmas tradition.,1349827200,,246,4.212765957446808
2397878,2,B000AYEIZ4,"My rating is based partly on the price. We have this on VHS tape. It is okay... I don't mind taking the time to watch it every 10 or 15 years for nostalgia's sake, but honestly, FIFTY dollars for a half hour second rate TV program from the early 80s. Seriously? Um... no. Unless you are Bill Gates, or one of the other members of the 1%, I suggest you spend your money on something more worthwhile.

P.S. I wouldn't listen to comments from bitter people who have to resort to namecalling and personal insults to make their point. Obviously he learned nothing from the content of ""Ziggy's Gift."" Sad--very sad.

P.P.S. Whether you see this on DVD or VHS, digital download, or a film that has been sitting in your local library for thirty years, it's still the same program... and not worth $50 in any format.

P.P.P.S. As the price has been lowered significantly, I would say that if you are fan of two out of these three: Ziggy, cheesy early eighties animated specials, or cheesy early eighties Christmas specials, it may be worth the 20-odd bucks to you. I would alter my rating to three stars, but don't want to give the nasty people the satisfaction. A bitter pill to take, but there you are.",1323388800,,1195,4.472477064220183

2397880,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Ziggy's Gift is an absolutely adorable Christmas special.  I have fond memories of watching this Christmas special as a child.  My father taped it for us along with many other holiday specials from the 60's, 70's, and 80's and we watched it every Christmas growing up.  Now as adults, my brother and I still fight over who gets the holiday specials tape every Christmas.  I even show the Ziggy special to my students every holiday season now.  Its message of peace and good will towards those less fortunate is a very pleasant change of pace from the frenzied, consumer driven specials that are being made nowadays.  A definite A+ in this teacher's grade book.",1295395200,,660,4.745614035087719
2397881,5,B000AYEIZ4,"I love amazon for movies that you can't find anywhere else. I watched this cartoon as a kid, but haven't seen it for 25 years. This is a sweet cartoon with a great message. Ziggy will warm your heart and remind you to be kind to others.",1294531200,,236,4.042553191489362
2397883,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Gosh, I remember watching Ziggy's gift when I was a child. I forgot about this cartoon until I saw it for sale on Amazon. I had to have it! I don't normally get choked up but, this is one of the saddest (in a good way) holiday specials there is.
I'm just surprised that it's not aired as often as these other shows.

2397888,5,B000AYEIZ4,"For many years we had this special taped off television, and then we lost it. It's one of those old Christmas cartoons that just makes it Christmas to me, and when I found it on DVD I had to buy it. After all these years it's just as good as I remembered, and I'm not at all ashamed to admit, it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside to watch it. The sort of Christmas special they don't make anymore. I find the difference between cheesy and touching is often a case of sincerity, this cartoon makes it work. Finding this and ""A Wish for Wings that Work"" on Amazon have been what got me shopping here.",1248912000,,601,4.145299145299146

I did, and later went to Amazon hoping to find it, and there it was.  Ordered it as a Christmas surprise and was delighted to see this great program again.  It's only a half hour show,and it is touching and 'sweet' - as my twenty-something gift recipient noted.  Not the Nutcracker or The Messiah, but something you might want to add to your list of Christmas musts.",1232150400,,493,4.384615384615385
2397891,5,B000AYEIZ4,"This, and A Wish For Wings That Work, are the only Christmas cartoons I can watch over and over. Brings out the spirit of Christmas without cloying sentimentality

2397892,5,B000AYEIZ4,I love this movie. Ziggy in his own way spreads the joy of Christmas and by doing so changes others along the way.  It is really a heart warming Christmas cartoon that just makes me smile.  It is the joy of giving and making the best of the situation you are in.  I saw this on TV years ago and have been searching for it ever since.  It will certainly be a regular part of our Christmas Seasons.,1227052800,,396,4.038461538461538

I remember watching this on HBO as a kid and I enjoyed it very much.  Twenty years later I plan on having my sons experience this Christmas classic that only a lovable and pure character like Ziggy can offer.

This is just a great example of the warmth of the human spirit and the power of kindness.  Get away from the daily grind, have fun with Ziggy, and feel good about humanity again. . .",1188432000,,461,4.204545454545454

Five stars out of Five for this special!

2397909,4,B000AYEIZ4,"I'm not really a fan of the Ziggy comic strip but I think it's cute from time to time.

This animated special is actually pretty decent though. The animation is really nice!

There's a thief character that is strangely similiar to the Thief from ""The Thief and the Cobbler""--which makes sense since both were directed by Animation legend, Richard Williams.  Not an amazing holiday special, but one worth watching if you are an animation lover and into holiday cartoons.

The DVD also has some interesting bonus features including scans of Ziggy comic strip panels and some animated shorts (most of which are cheezy but curious odditities...)",1169078400,,641,5.018867924528302

2397926,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Ziggy's Gift was a strange surprise to me when released in in 1982.

After years of the same old Christmas cartoon's (Rudolph, Frosty, Charlie Browns Christmas),  from out of no where comes this Christmas classic destined to become a staple in the yearly Christmas lineup for kids.

Ziggy's Gift, while very short @ 23 minutes, embodies all the important qualities of a good Christmas show.  Love, caring, giving, and peace on earth.  Tom Wilson manages to pack his message in a playful and sometimes tear jerking way in the time alloted for his 1/2 hour special.

The show really supports the true meaning of Christmas and ends with an orphanage scene that is not to be forgotten!!  Ziggy's dog even makes friends with a kitten in the show!!

Go out and get it if you are tired of the same old Christmas specials.  Here's where Ziggy's gift stands in my top five shows:

1.  Charlie Brown's Christmas
2.  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
3.  Ziggy's Gift
4.  Frosty the Snowman
5.  Santa Claus in Comin to Town

Enjoy!

2397928,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Ziggy, known in this short feature as ""the little guy"" goes innocently about his business just doing what he always does, which when one looks at it in the proper light, is a blessing to all.  Ziggy shows us all that the simple things, being honest, living with love and charity in your heart and mind, and keeping busy by serving others instead of yourself is the gift that keeps on giving.  Ziggy's Gift does all this while keeping all ages laughing at the antics that surround him.  I first viewed this short in the 80's when my children were small, and to this day, we still call our Thanksgiving bird a Torekey.  Watch and you'll see what I mean.  It will become a family favorite.",1131321600,5,686,4.412698412698413
2397929,5,B000AYEIZ4,This is probably the BEST Christmas cartoon special of all time. I've been waiting a long time for this to come out on dvd. I have a copy of this program on a Betamax (remember those things) tape that I recorded off of HBO probably 20+ years ago. Buy multiple copies and give them away for Christmas!!! Ho! Ho! Ho!!!,1128556800,11,316,4.283333333333333
2397930,5,B000AYEIZ4,"Ziggy's Gift is for everyone.  It embodies the true spirit of Christmas giving. Children will enjoy the humorous antics, parents will love the deeper meaning, and everyone will feel peace on earth, good will toward men. The world is not a perfect place by any means, but if more people gave as Ziggy gives, it would be a far better place, especially at Christmas.",1127692800,,363,4.671875
2397931,5,B000AYEIZ4,"I was so filled with joy and excitement when I saw that ZIGGY's GIFT was available on DVD!

 I almost wanted to cry. I'm serious.

  This is one of, if not THE best Christmas special in history!

  This heartwarming show will fill you with the spirit of Christmas.

 Beautiful! Magical! Inspiring! Emotional! Funny! Good hearted!

 I cant tell you just how good this special is. The fact that it won an award for best Animated show is just a hint of how great this show is.

 And the beautiful song (Cant remember the title) that chimes the meaning of Christmas, ""Give, Give, Love"" perfectly compliments this Holiday Classic.

 It took a long time to come to DVD, but it was worth the wait.

  I love this show so much I ordered 3 copies! LOL

 I'll probably wear them all out watching it.

  This special isn't very long, about 25 minutes to a half an hour, but believe me, it is worth it.

  You will be touched and you will be filled with the Christmas spirit when you enjoy this great show.

 It's message of love, peace, and giving to those less fortunate are contagious.

  Get yourself an early Christmas gift this year. Get this DVD.

 And enjoy it all Holiday Season long!

  Watching this show is sure to become a Christmas tradition in your home.

 If I could have given it ten stars, I would have.",1126224000,25,1309,4.385593220338983
