5372564,2,B009YMEPJ2,"THE HOUNDS is one strange movie.  It's difficult to review without revealing ""spoilers"".  Suffice to say, I didn't really enjoy it very much.  The first 40 minutes are painfully dull and uneventful.  It takes the whole film to understand the connection between the main plot and the enigmatic subplot, and then it's pretty unbelievable.
I enjoy films that challenge my deductive skills but I demand quality film-making and necessary clarity...things that don't exist in THE HOUNDS.  Therefore, a thumbs down for this misfire.",1367625600,,525,5.27710843373494
5372565,2,B009YMEPJ2,"The title of this feature is a head fake. There are no hounds chasing kids in the woods. You find out what the title means at the end.

The film runs with a subplot that does not seem to connect to anything. It lasts for all of the film until the very end when they come together at which point I groaned.

Four seemingly level headed young adults who like to drink decide to go camping. About half way into the film they find a body, then weird things happen that make you think they are descending into madness aka ""Yellow Brick Road."" This would have made a good film except they added a subplot.

In this subplot, bad guys who exchange money for ? are being investigated by Mike, a detective who also likes his drink too much. The only link between the two is when our token eye candy, Sarah (Maddie Moate) has dreams, visions,and hears things the others do not. Clues are kept to a minimum.

The movie has some tension factors to it, such as when Sarah wanders through the forest by herself. The woods scenes were done great, the subplot was substandard as we find out details of the investigator that simply don't relate to anything. The film doesn't hold your interest until midway when they discover the body...feel free to fast forward to that point.

This is an interesting horror film that borders on being cerebral and lousy. It will attract a small group of fans. I am not one of them.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Maddie Moate in bra during foreplay.",1363996800,3,1479,4.439114391143911
5372566,1,B009YMEPJ2,You might as well take your money and set it on fire if you waste it on this movie. This is horrible.  Nothing about it is good. Very low budget looked like a 10 year old shot it with a cell phone camera. The story line was ridiculously stupid and made abdolutely no sense at all. I cant believe I sat through this and even more I wasted money on this movie. Save your money!!! This is a fair warning. You will thank me later.,1363824000,3,426,4.011764705882353
5372567,3,B009YMEPJ2,"This horror flick shows what can be done with a low production budget as long as the story matters.  Without spoiling it, 3 friends go on a camping holiday and come accross a dead body at the camp site.  Is it really dead?  Are they really camping?  Meanwhile a detective is morning his dead young daughter who accidentally shot herself with his gun.  How does he relate to the campers?  Flashbacks of the trio at a disco partying it up and are in the sight of some sinister characters.  What is their intent?  What are or who are the hounds?  Are they wild dogs or members of something?  You must see this movie to find out.  Hint:  Things may not be what they seem to be.  The overall acting and directing is mediocre at best, but we're provided with a few scary jolts.  Stick to it!  The twisted ending makes the 1:30mins. film duration worth it.",1363132800,2,849,4.352564102564102
5372568,2,B009YMEPJ2,"Generally good acting and filming can't save this low budget exercise in gore-horror from an unfocused, repetitive, and disjointed storyline. There are one or two good ""jump"" scenes, but most of the film reverberates between tense and harrowing to just plain silly, and, alas, there is much more of the latter quality. The two sets of characters and settings really do intertwine, but their relationship is hard to see or care about.",1362787200,3,433,5.027777777777778
5372569,1,B009YMEPJ2,"Total waste of time. Horrible script, stupid story line, terrible acting, poor editing, and lousy filming, get the picture. Don't waste your watching this movie. I wish I could give it zero stars",1362528000,3,195,4.9393939393939394
5372570,5,B009YMEPJ2,"I Enjoied this movie, good plot and stunning FX once the guys get into the woods...nothing is like as it looks, be patience for the first 25 minutes, then is a ""on the edge of the seat"" film! 5 stars for me!",1357948800,,207,3.9523809523809526
5372571,3,B009YMEPJ2,"So this was kind of foreboding and What is that : Flashbacks in the woods or what ???

This film went that way and this and put a whole new meaning to camping and friendships.

There was a film with similar theme,MUGGERS,But it took a funny slant,The Hounds does not,Not even a little.

Oh,The DON'T DRINK IN PUBLIC point shall be well heeded with this flick.",1357689600,4,359,4.409090909090909

8545290,4,B009YMEPJ2,"This is one of those movies where the end justifies the means.  There are a lot of little details in the first half or so of this very slow starter that seem completely disconnected.  If you pay attention to details, they are put together quite smoothly in the last 20 minutes.  Even though the first 40 minutes of the movie is as much fun as watching molasses drip down a drainpipe, the rest of the movie is worth the pain getting to it.  It becomes a horrific nightmare with lots of jumps, blood, and gore with some surprises along the way.  I almost rated it a three, but after the seeing the ending and how it all came together, I became a fan.",1511049600,,648,4.235772357723577
8545291,5,B009YMEPJ2,5 stars because I wasn't able to puzzle it out until they explained it in the end. Well thought out and confusing at the same time. Jumped half a dozen times. Watched on Prime.,1509062400,,176,4.205882352941177
8545292,1,B009YMEPJ2,This movie was filled with way more than the usual stupid behavior seen in so many wannabe horror films. No one in his or her right mind would make the unfathomable decisions these characters made.,1508976000,,197,4.6571428571428575
8545293,1,B009YMEPJ2,Pretty freaking lame. I don't think I'd watch it again unless threatened with a deadly weapon. Not worth the couple hours it took to watch it.,1508976000,,142,4.5

8545295,4,B009YMEPJ2,"We see a woman wake up in the woods in the beginning of the movie.  Two men and a woman have a drink in a bar.  Their names are Jake, Dave and Sarah.  Then we see two guys drinking on the sidewalk outside.  One of them is Martin, who's also friends with the three I mention just one sentence ago.  He joins Jake, Dave and Sarah at the restaurant.  They talk about camping in the woods tomorrow.  We see a business deal going on in a basement... somewhere.  The one guy makes a phone call to someone saying there will be no mistakes this time or you'll pay the consequences.  While the three prepare for the trip to the woods, we see two business men discussing that they've never made a fatal mistake.  The younger guy of the two puts his heart into his work and plans on keeping it that way.  They talk about talking to a woman but nothing constructive is said- this is just teaser material.

While driving down a back road, Sarah mentions to her boyfriend Jake a nightmare she had the night before that her sheets were blood soaked and she woke up.  Dave mentions splitting up with his girlfriend Anna a week or month after they were on this same trip to the woods.  All three of them meet up and hike through the woods while scary music plays.  A man at home sits on his couch while his young son walks up to him and grabs a gun hiding under the man's teddy bear.  The mother sees the kid playing with the gun and tells him to put it down but it's too late- he shot himself.  This haunts the father- the same father we see briefly in his own separate storyline throughout this movie.

Jake, Dave and Sarah bring up Anna again while in the woods.  Jake hilariously agrees ""Yea, she did have some ""nice points"" implying her breasts were big.  The man whose little boy shot himself continues sitting in his car.  He talks on the phone to his wife and they argue, but we see she's pregnant.  She thinks this pregnancy will be the turning point to move on from the death of their son.  Back at the camp site, the woman says she's on her knees but... I don't know if she meant what it sounds like, lol.  Not sure if that's a figure of speech.  She makes out with Jake in the tent a moment later so hey, maybe not!

Dave disrupts Jake and Sarah who are making out because he sees bugs buzzing around a corpse in the ground.  Sarah wants to leave while Dave digs to find out if it's just a body part or an entire body under the soil.  Sarah thinks it's odd Dave would be curious over such a thing and well, so do I!  Whether a body part or an entire body- it's still a human!  We see a corpse with a plastic bag around his head.  Jake gets angry that we're in the middle of nowhere without a phone and they have to deal with a corpse.  Not really!  You can just set up another camp site 50 yards away from the bugs and the smell.  There, problem eliminated.

The man who lost his son is standing by a road at night and talking on the phone giving a description of someone to somebody.  He finishes by saying ""You can't miss him"".  Jake, Sarah and Dave have a discussion over the dead buried body with a bag around its head.  Dave says there's no conspiracy going on here- it's just bad luck these three happened to stumble upon him.  The man who lost his son is now in the car outside a restaurant waiting for somebody.  A car drives by and he follows. Jake, Sarah and Dave smell a chemical and think it's the dead body.

Later Sarah wakes up in a tent after hearing voices.  She hears something outside her tent.  Dave notices the buried body somehow got uncovered.  When he returns the body's gone.  Dave, Jake and Sarah all agree they have to stay together to figure out what's going on.  They walk in the woods.  Jake says if it's an animal it will run away.  Dave says we have to go back to the tent because Sarah's frightened, but Jake disagrees.  Jake asks ""What kind of animal could've ripped a corpse out of the ground!""

Meanwhile Sarah is overwhelmed by weird screeching sounds and runs away.  Dave seems more concerned for Sarah's well being than her boyfriend Jake.  That's weird man!  Jake must be one of those ""Oh, my girlfriend's scared? She must learn to handle herself and fight through the scares because I'm a man and won't tolerate having a weak girlfriend"" type of boyfriends.  In other words, a jerk.  Sarah returns to her tent, makes a phone call and suddenly someone in the tent rips her heart out while she's running away.  Dave looks at the figure and says ""It's not possible you're alive"".  Jake asks Dave what to do since somehow Sarah's alive, and Dave has medical experience.  Dave says we need the burner and the knife, and a first aid kit too.

I guess it wasn't Sarah's heart the monster dropped on the ground since if it was, Dave and Jake wouldn't be trying so hard to save her life.  She screams when Dave puts the butcher knife in her back.  He puts stitches in her skin but doesn't know if Sarah will make it. Sarah dreams she's in a night club.  She wakes up and says she saw the attackers face in the dream.  Dave freaks out swinging an ax outside his tent.  They think the land they placed their tent on is cursed.  Dave drives away as Jake cries with Sarah.  Jake says he can be unpredictable and domesticated, but one thing Sarah needs to know is that he'll do anything for her.  Jake that is. He mentions taking Sarah to the hospital.

Just then a man reaches in the tent and pokes Jake's eyes out.  He runs around the woods screaming in pain.  I guess he'll be taking Sarah *and* himself to the hospital, haha.  Their friend Martin finally shows up.  Wow, took him long enough!  I think he overslept or something.  He says he's not leaving Sarah alone in the tent.  He'll get help.  Dave opens a tent at another camp site and a cloaked man lying down gets up and strangles him.  Dave runs away scared.

Jake with his gouged out eyeball hugs Martin when the two run into each other in the woods.  Martin makes Jake scream.  Dave hears this on the other side of the woods and says ""What's going on!""  Martin quietly walks around in the woods after killing Jake.  He's scared.  Just then a bloody chain smacks his face, and a man who looks like Martin grabs his stomach and kills him.  Dave runs into Jake.  Jake says they need to get back to Sarah because Martin, who is Dave's brother, ripped out his eyes.  Jake says Martin's been manipulated in some way.  Up ahead Dave sees Martin dead.  We see Sarah get dizzy at a party.  She must be dreaming again.  She wakes up in the tent, even managing to stand.  She's made major improvements after having her lower organs ripped out.

She walks out of her tent and cries.  Dave helps Jake through the wood since he won't be able to see until he gets medical attention.  Sarah's back in the tent.  She doesn't have a pulse.  At least she was able to leave the tent one last time to get a breath of fresh air before dying.  When Dave turns around a pulse-less Sarah is now awake and strangling a blind Jake.  This is a big relationship change compared to the make out scene the two had earlier.  WHAT THE!  Dave turns around and sees Sarah sitting by a tree!  The Sarah doppelganger in the tent is the evil one.  Dave whacks her down.  The nice Sarah by the tree says ""That was me!""

The good Sarah asks ""Where are we?""  ""What are those noises!"" as she covers her ears.  Dave looks at her like ""Should I kill you too just to be safe?""  A man sneaks behind the good Sarah, grabs her then strangles her.  The evil Sarah feels the strangulation while the good Sarah grabs her throat in relief.  The bad Sarah is now by the tree.  Dave goes ballistic and kills the man while the evil roped Sarah growls.  When the good Sarah looks up Dave is gone.  Dave appears again.  He has his liver in his hand and falls over dead beside the growling Sarah.  The good Sarah screams in confusion, takes an ax and cuts the evil Sarah's head off.

The man then wakes up.  I guess Dave didn't kill him.  Jake wakes up and asks for Sarah.  Sarah turns around and the man is holding Dave's liver.  Meanwhile the man earlier whose little boy shot himself turns out to be a detective  He walks into a building and says it's too late to Sarah who's lying on a bed.  The detective says to Sarah, who mysteriously left the forest for unclear reasons, that her friends are victims.

Jake's also in this building.  I'm not sure why they aren't in an actual hospital.  Actually I'm not sure why they're not in the forest!  The detective explains the camping trip to Sarah.  The Hounds is a secret organization that precure human organs for the black market.  The blood Hounds got away this time.  The detective mentions spiked drinks and sedatives, and that Sarah never went camping and never stepped foot in a forest.  The drugs made her hallucinate.  Wow, what a twist!  This explains why Sarah often had dreams she was dizzy at a party, and the noises that made her cover her ears were equipment the Hounds were using to remove her body parts.

I'm being nice giving the Hounds 4 stars.  The first 40 minutes is pretty boring.  Too much talking, partying and preparing for the camping trip.  The detective's reason for being in the story takes a long time to discover.  Until the end he feels like he's unnecessary.  I'm disappointed the Hounds isn't based around vicious angry hound dogs attacking campers in the woods.  It sure seemed like the story was going that way.  I did like the twist at the end, even though it got really confusing with the good Sarah and evil Sarah.  That part still doesn't make sense.  At least the detective who lost his son had a story that makes sense.  The killings are okay, and the storyline is pretty good.  The story even nicely wraps up with the detective feeling sad over losing his son for a while, but realizing  he has to start anew with his pregnant wife.  I recommend this.",1500681600,,9874,4.308237861429351

8545297,3,B009YMEPJ2,"I watched half of it last night (it put me to sleep! No joke!), and the other half today. Well the first 45 minutes are really boring, then after that it goes to WTF?!? I HATED how the black guy (forgot his name!) talked to his girlfriend ""oh baby stop"" every other sentence REALLY ANNOYING! And he seems to be whining it the entire time.....
The premise of the movie was good, BUT the execution was HORRIBLE! The FX and CGI?! Well WHAT FX AND CGI? They had the 2 stories that seemed to not have ANYTHING to do with each other until the last 5 minutes of the movie!
*SPOILERS*
I really thought that the boss dude was a drug lord or something NOT the police! The guy below him? Well we only see him 5 minutes of the movie so WHO IS HE?!? The characters aren't even worth it! BUT the ending is!
This movie is about organ steeling! A very REAL thing! The whole camping in the woods was a dream enducted by the drugs and the sounds and feelings they were hearing and well feeling (DUH!) are theirs! When you stop and think about the whole thing only AFTER you hear why they are there and WTF is going on... I kinda get it!",1470614400,,1118,4.13302752293578
