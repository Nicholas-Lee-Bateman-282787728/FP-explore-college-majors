5451430,5,B00AMQGFJM,"I wanted Madhouse on DVD, and was happy to be able to get it (my old copy was a VHS).  Amazon had a great price and the second movie on the DVD was a bonus.",1377302400,,156,3.4571428571428573

5451433,4,B00AMQGFJM,"Although I bought the DVD for Madhoouse, Carbon Copy was worth seeing as well.  Carbon Copy is for all California natives",1371427200,,121,4.761904761904762
5451434,3,B00AMQGFJM,"I loved the movie, ""Madhouse,"" but I am not pleased with a couple of glitches in the middle of the DVD.  There is something wrong with the DVD.",1370995200,,143,4.107142857142857
5451435,5,B00AMQGFJM,I haven't watched Carbon Copy yet but I bought this for Madhouse- I used to have it on VHS and wanted it on DVD because I remember it being so funny...and it still is! Kirsty Alley and John Laroquette are a riot and this movie will certainly make you think twice about having house guests :),1367366400,4,291,4.214285714285714
5451436,5,B00AMQGFJM,"This review is only for Madhouse- Don't confuse this with the awful horror movies by the same name.  This is great comedy.

I really love this movie and have been waiting for it to come out on DVD.  By itself, it is reason enough to spend the money on this 'double feature'.  I had ""Madhouse"" on laser disc years ago but donated that collection to a library years ago.  This is one of the movies I have not been able to replace on DVD until now.

  - If you like John Larroquette,
  - If you like Kirstie Alley,
  - If you like seeing snobby yuppies getting taken down a peg or too,
  - If you like cats,
  - If you hate cats,...
Then this movie is for you. There is a hysterical running gag about the cat!

Now I can check off another one from my movie bucket list.",1365638400,12,766,4.033557046979865

5451457,4,B00AMQGFJM,"Like many others, I bought this because of Madhouse, not Carbon Copy, although the cast of that has stirred interest. Burned copy or not, the quality was very impressive, except its missing the trailers. Its nice that many forgotten movies are getting the disc treatment, even just burned, better than not at all. I would welcome a release from United Artists/ MGM, or certain others, but once again, any but Echo Bridge!",1419465600,,421,4.861111111111111

I can watch this over and over and totally relate! Get it for a good laugh. This has too be Kirstie Alley's best performance. I use to live in LA and when the relatives from back east would come and visit...this movie couldn't be more accurate! Just saying.",1393027200,,417,4.5

5451492,4,B00AMQGFJM,"This is one of Denzel's first movies, and I've always loved it.  It has a great story line and deals with the issues of racism in a comical way, but it is very real.",1388620800,,165,3.8529411764705883
5451493,4,B00AMQGFJM,"I am appreciative that Amazon bought one of my all time favorite movies to me but I wish it was on a regular DVD. Anyway, I only bought the set for Madhouse, haven't watched carbon copy yet. Madhouse is about a couple who has everything under control until an unexpected visit from cousins occurs. From the moment the cousins step off of the plane everything rolls down hill. This movie makes you never want to have company....",1387670400,2,427,4.558441558441558
5451494,5,B00AMQGFJM,I love Madhouse. It is hilarious!!! I've been looking for it on DVD forever. Many places said it was never made on DVD. Even eBay only had it on VHS and for a lot more than this two pack. I was so excited when I found this two pack. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it,1382486400,2,277,3.793103448275862
5451495,4,B00AMQGFJM,"I'd always enjoyed MADHOUSE and this is the widescreen presentation of it - whew!  On a scale of 10, this is an 8.  CARBON gets a 5-ish - lower-average film",1380672000,,156,4.166666666666667

8553944,5,B00AMQGFJM,Great,1477353600,,5,5.0
8553945,5,B00AMQGFJM,"We got this strictly for ""Madhouse"".  The movie is hilarious and the things that Kirstie Alley and John Larroquette is just crazy!!  Personally, I would have had to remove everyone from the house, but then there wouldn't be this hilarious movie.  It's ""old"" from 1990, but it's stood up well to time.

The quality was great and there was no issues playing the movie.  We've watched it a couple times and it has played fine each time.  Shipping was quick and packing was suffice.",1473552000,,478,4.630952380952381
8553946,4,B00AMQGFJM,"I purchased this for Madhouse - I never saw the other film. I absolutely loved Madhouse as a kid - the scenes with the cat are the most memorable, from its ridiculous puke in the car to its tweaking out on cocaine. Alley and Larroquette give great performances here, and the end is a satisfying conclusion to the frustration that builds up for this poor couple over the course of the film. A cute little understated comedy that is also the reason for my familiarity with the great song ""Bernadette"" by the Four Tops.",1468800000,,516,4.5
8553947,5,B00AMQGFJM,Carbon Copy is an old favorite of mine and I was excited to get the multi-pak.. great value and delivered as expected,1461283200,,117,4.363636363636363
8553948,4,B00AMQGFJM,love the movie,1447545600,,14,4.0
8553949,1,B00AMQGFJM,"Watched the start of Madhouse, until at about 10 Minutes I was totally fed up with it. Too dumb to be funny. One example: a cat escapes in a car and 'throws up' all over everybody, including the windscreen. So incredibly fake. Obviously desires a different kind of humor than I have.
Don't like Carbon Copy either.",1441497600,,314,4.526315789473684
8553950,5,B00AMQGFJM,"FINALLY! I've been waiting for years, stalking the internets, for this gem of a film, featuring elephants, undead felines, high finance, and the tall, fantastic prosecutor from Night Court.  The other movie is amazingly terrible - just throw it away; don't let it deter you - watch Head Office (with Judge Reinhold!), instead, as a double feature.",1441065600,,347,5.087719298245614
