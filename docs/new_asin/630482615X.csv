936442,5,630482615X,"Judi Dench, first lady of the British theatre, portrays Queen Victoria in  this capitvating film. Much of the acting is remarkable--Dame Judi Dench  knows how to build and sustain a character through all the ""slings and  arrows of outrageous fortune."" The depth of feeling that she displays  -- in sorrow and in joy -- speaks of an actress who knows her craft well  and takes the time to practice it.  ""Mr. Brown"" and the officials  of the court are well portrayed; here again one marvels at how well the  characters are built and sustained.  A first rate piece of work.  Well  done!  END",904089600,11,588,4.601941747572815
936443,5,630482615X,"I watched this video only recently and I was enchanted by Dame Judi Dench and Billy Connolly who gave an excellent performance as John Brown, Queen Victoria's man servant. I was a bit skeptical about the film at first but I am a convert to the cause. Watch this and enjoy, it's not a tear-jearker for those looking for kisses and roses but it will bring a lump to your throat as you watch a fragile friendship develop between the austere Queen of England and the rough and ready Scotsman who became her most loyal subject in a time of need. John Brown is never portrayed as a Saint, he is drinker and blasphemer who somehow managed to charm Queen Victoria and anger a nation at the same time. Judy Dench gives a credible performance as the brittle and aging Queen grieving for her dead husband and the storyline follows their friendship from beginning to end. Look out for the scene when John Brown goes skinny-dipping in the sea, it's enough to make your teeth chatter for a lifetime!",901497600,,985,4.5083798882681565

936678,4,630482615X,"This is an interesting story of the Queen Victoria's controversial relationship with her servant. It's well done and it can be enjoyed even if the story is warped a bit to fit the actors. Judi Dench plays the Queen excellently and Billy Connolly is very entertaining, but the timeline is a little off.  Although Queen Victoria kept detailed journals for most of her life, they were heavily censored by her daughter after her death. This is what the Queen had asked her to do. In addition, her family tried to erase as much of John Brown as they could. His letters and journals were destroyed. He did mean a lot to her and this film tells that story well. However, the film gives the distinct impression that the Queen was a mid-sixties lonely grieving widow. The real story is that the relationship started in her 40's with Brown in his thirties. Granted, she stayed in deep mourning and dressed like an old woman after Prince Albert died, but this film seems to compress their twenty year relationship into a a short span set in their later years.",1493164800,7,1048,4.60427807486631

937222,1,630482615X,"This review is of the presentation of this film on Amazon Instant Video.  I saw this move a number of years ago, and remember it as being quite good.  So the one star here does not reflect the actual quality of the movie itself, but rather the serious audio problem with it on Amazon Instant Video.  Somehow, ALL of the languages which were dubbed for the audio play simultaneously.  Needless to say, this renders the film unwatchable.

I talked with an Amazon customer service rep, who refunded my rental price, and said he would alert tech support, so the problem could be corrected.  A couple days later, I tried to watch the film online again - same problem.  Nothing's been done to correct it.  If you really want to stream this film online, you may want to try Netflix.  Or the other option would be to just buy the DVD.

In either case, save yourself the frustration of trying to stream it on Amazon...at least for now.  I'm hoping this review will get Amazon's attention, since my contact with customer service apparently did not.",1425340800,16,1038,4.586956521739131

937290,4,630482615X,"I'm amazed to see this reviewed as historical - even as being too dryly factual! Except for the basic situation of the queen's mourning, the ""facts"" presented here are subjectively selected and colored, following the viewpoint dramatically attributed to an opinionated highland servant named John Brown. The play consists of lampooning everybody John Brown would not have approved of, from Sir Henry Ponsonby and Dr William Jenner through the Prince of Wales and Prime Minister Disraeli (in spades!) even to Queen Victoria and her household servants. These personages are shown (and brilliantly acted) as embodiments of John Brown's self-centered and brusquely simplistic valuations - which he of course takes for commonsense truths and which enjoy some sort of temporary and conditional acceptance for the Queen's sake. So the gillie is ""in,"" almost anywhere he wants to be! Hence the scandal ... or the flirtation ... or the therapy ... or the love story. ""Mrs Brown"" is a touching screenplay, well written, beautifully filmed, memorable ... but Noble Savage literature is satire: playfully insightful commentary on history, not history itself.

So I liked this, with some reservations as to its aims and effects. I would recommend it to two different groups of viewers: those whose grasp of history is solid enough not to be unduly swayed; and those who don't care much about history but might enjoy a dramatic achievement on its own terms in spite of the accents and costumes. Others should be careful.",1421712000,,1506,5.172131147540983

Queen goes into a prolonged depression after the death of her husband that makes her hole up and not want to do anything.  An overbearing scotsman comes along to encourage her to go outdoors.  The two get strangely attached to each other and rumors start to spread about how the country can do without a monarchy and about Mr. Brown's involvement in the court.  That's all.... That's the big conflict in the film.  There's just not much going on in the film, but somehow you get hooked and it's because of the great actors.  Judi Dench was wonderful as Queen victoria and I found the performance of many of the smaller characters to be just as noteworthy.  Connolly does a good job, but I have to say I found his character unlikable and I'm not sure if that's solely because of the script or not.  I found Mr. Brown to be a pompous arse and if I was supposed to feel sorry for him at some point, it didn't work.  In short I definitely recommend this film.  You'll know the actors are doing a great job because the story itself is so boring and yet you won't be bored watching.",1405555200,,1176,4.402777777777778

I also adore Dame Judi Dench, so this movie is a no brainer for me.  I first saw it at the movie theater years ago, and this was my third or fourth time to watch it but the first time on Prime.  It did not disappoint!  I do not know if this is a historically correct re-telling of Queen Victoria's platonic friendship with one of Albert's stablemen, but I do know that Queen Victoria was devastated by the death of her beloved Prince Albert. I would like to think that in her saddest times, she did have a true friend, who was loyal to her and who sincerely had her best interests at heart without any personal agenda of his own. Both Dame Judi's and Billy Connolly's acting are superb,and the scenery is picturesque.  This beautifully told tale is definitely my cup of tea.  Cheers!",1403913600,,898,4.418181818181818

But after the death of her beloved Albert, her husband's personal attendant assumes a position of protector of the widow much to the dismay of many of her advisors and attendants.  If you enjoyed Billy's brogue and role in the recent ""Quartet"", you'll appreciate the character he portrays here.  Judi is perfect as the widow and Queen.",1402444800,3,521,4.8977272727272725

Brown stretches his formal authority by a couple of country miles, via the Queen's increasing reliance on him to boost her morale. Naturally the servants resent this, he gets beat up, blah, blah, blah, and blah.

The Queen, deep in despair caused by the loss of her husband, was subject to the same grief as of numerous women in her kingdom who suffered the same loss.  The difference between the  two classes of widows was that the Queen was not forced to face the responsibilities of life as quickly as her counter parts.  When Mr. Brown came on the scene, he re-established a familiar routine in the Queens life.  (We often think of routine as boring; in reality it is comforting.)  Mr. Brown was such a strong personality that he not-so-gently reminded the Queen that she too was strong enough to overcome any obstacle.

937723,5,630482615X,"This was a wonderful period piece at a time of great sadness for Queen Victoria. The Monarchy was now Imperial - as a world-wide Empire where ""the Sun never sets."" But we see past the veil of Royalty to see Victoria in her grief as quite a real woman in a time where women were not powerful and viewed as ""weak."" Dame Judi Densch shows them real majesty and strength by her choice to cast off sorrow in taking heed of the late Prince Albert's gamekeeper and guide from Balmoral Castle, John Brown. His ""no-nonsense"" approach towards her safety and well-being go awry when ambition exceed political savvy. Mr. Brown makes enemies in the Royal Family upstairs and their servants downstairs. Look for a surprise appearance by Gerard Butler, as Mr. Brown's brother Archie, behind the scenes in the servant's Hall. He cautions his brother against such ambition and provides a good baseline of home style Scottish practicality. The unrequited passion between Mr. Brown and the Queen is palpable and wonderfully present throughout the film. Simply marvelous!",1390867200,4,1051,4.943502824858757

And I cannot find any feature to turn them off. Indeed, my dvd player and my tv both show captioning is off. <shrugs> Very distracting and annoying.

The movie itself is fantastic, of course. The role for which Dame Judy Dench won Best Actress. Her portrayal of Queen Victoria is dignified and at the same time appropriately human.

I realize that it may not be an accurate story of the relationship between Queen Victoria and Mr. Brown, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  Billy Connolly is also a great actor and the chemistry in this movie is wonderful.

To see Dench as the grieving Queen Victoria is to see Victoria come to life in such a special way..  Billy Connolly as Mr. Brown is magnificent.

937893,4,630482615X,"The ingredient that makes this movie so entertaining is the well acted characters, starting with Judi Dench down to all the actors of the serving staff, who added validity and quality to the production. The story itself revolves around Queen Victoria's  inability to cope with the death of her husband and of her growing dependency on his personal aid who arrives to help her recover. With beautiful and historic backdrops it gives us a look at a monarchy that is not only the ""last word""on every topic but where questioning a choice is not tolerated. For those who enjoy historical and political manipulation you might want to give this one a try.",1378771200,2,648,4.785714285714286

I am not especially supportive of monarchy, but as a period piece, Mrs. Brown is fresh and interesting on an intimate relationship between the Queen and her patriotic supporter, with important figures like Prime Minister Disraeli making an appearance. Good for history buffs, and family viewing  and easy to watch. I am surprised there are no other reviews on this, I watched this once before on Amazon a year ago.",1378684800,,582,5.0625

938049,3,630482615X,"As a long-time fan of British period drama and Masterpiece Theatre, I was really excited about a 2011 DVD of this 1997 production.  Unfortunately, for me this film did not equal the hype of the editorial synopsis and raves by many amazon.com reviewers.  I was greatly disappointed with ""Mrs. Brown"".

One of the underlying problems seemed to be in a lack of first-hand knowledge of the complex interpersonal relationship between Victoria and Mr. Brown and a very limited amount of time to develop the characters and their relationship. The script-writing, casting of the major roles (including Judi Dench and Billy Connolly), the directing and the film-editing were problematic for me.

An exception to my disappointment in the casting was Antony Sher as Prime Minister Disraeli; he gave a very convincing portrayal of the pragmatic politician and really looked like the character he was portraying.  The very fine actors, Judi Dench and Billy Connolly, were miscast and I really didn't see portrayal of ""passion"" between the mature Victoria and the commoner due to the script and directing rather than the actors in their roles.  For me it was similar to seeing a famous opera singer in a role twenty years junior to the actual age of the singer.  Gerard Butler, a favorite of mine since the Phantom of the Opera movie, gave a convincing portrayal but looked realistically more like Billy Connolly's son than a younger brother. Victoria was supposedly in her mid- to late-40s when the story began---it might have been better if the story could have been Queen Victoria remembering her relationship with Mr. Brown twenty years later.

The script seemed to have been written from information available in the public domain rather than biographical information from people intimately acquainted with Queen Victoria and her private feelings.  There was not a gradual unfolding of the relationship and the story simply did not hang together cohesively.  Victoria and Brown did not seem real and I never felt we were getting to know the characters as living people.

The BBC usually does better in British period dramas than this particular film.",1365984000,5,2141,5.088571428571429

938408,4,630482615X,"This is a character driven movie about the relationship between two people: The Queen of England, icon of her age, the widowed Queen Victoria (Dame Judy Dench) and Mr John Brown (Billy Connolly). For lack of an official title, Mr. Brown would become a general factotum combining  a number of personal functions while in his queen's service.

As this review will indicate there are problems with this movie. Dame Dench and Mr. Connolly present beautiful performances. Beautiful best describes the highland scenery and castle interiors, the attention to costuming and the general viewing experience of Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown. Hence the four stars.

If you are a fan of the small movie, of costume drama based on history and/or British royalty you will want this movie; my concerns aside. Likely you will want to own this movie rather than rent or instant view it. I still cannot leave behind my questions.

Having raised the issue of Mr. Brown's official title...  He had originally served as Prince Albert's ghillie, or Highland Scot for fishing guide and manservant.

Because he had been trusted by Prince Albert, the widowed, grieving and no longer young Queen would admit him into the very small circle she allowed to attend her in her grief.  Over time their relationship would become close and constant as to cause a scandal. This scandal would also be a part of a constitutional crisis that would arise questioning the need for royalty given the queen's near total withdrawal from public affairs.  The relationship is the plot of this movie. The political issue its' back drop. The scandal is made mention and otherwise not important to the movie.

Throughout her performance, Dame Dench moves across emotional states with her natural fluidity. She portrays a very self aware queen whose dignity will allow no presumption. Instantly she can call up the grief of Victoria and go straight into her role as the matriarch of an important family. Her performance is sufficient reward for selecting this move.

Mr. Connolly's Mr. Brown is more of a puzzle. His acting is worth watching. I just do not get who Mr. Brown is, or what drove him or ...more on this to follow. Movie editing and the script never explain how he got past the queen's emotional armor. At first she is leery and her retainers closely observant. Then suddenly she is galloping over wild highland hillside. How did this happen?

The CD jacket exclaims: ""Her forbidden passion!"" Except that this movie makes no case for or against the rumors. He is arrogant among the servants (his nominal peers), and physically handles a craven prince royal. How does he believe that these things are allowed? He is a gentle man, a drunkard and at the end a possible paranoid. Why does he think his Queens life is at risk?

Virtual all of the rest of the cast serves as back drop. The politicians are all vaguely unpleasant (the queen's attitude toward Prime Minister Disraeli may have been coldly correct in her early years, but the evidence would suggest that she would come to respect him) The place courtiers are not folks with whom you would sequester yourself. The Royal family is portrayed as an undistinguished and interchangeable; hardly worth getting to know as individuals.

The writing, directing and general flow of this movie argue for three stars, I don't hate these aspects, but they keep this from being a five-star gem.",1346371200,10,3392,4.888501742160279
938409,5,630482615X,"First I will get the ""techie"" stuff over with.  My wife and I watched this movie via the Amazon Prime program.  The download was perfect and the quality of the picture and sound were excellent.  We had no problems with it what so ever.

Now that being said...

What a beguiling this film was.  When I view a film whose story or theme is based on history, I am not one of those people who go berserk is the makers of the film stray from historical facts and use their artistic license to ""enhance"" the story.  The study of his history more or less belongs with the written word more or less or at least films which are distinctly labeled ""documentaries.""  Hey, I like to be entertained on one or more levels.  It is a pure delight to find a film that not only entertains, is well done, and pretty much historically accurate to boot.  In this film we had it all.  (Note:  Due to the rather intimate and personal subject matter, i.e. a story dealing with the thoughts and feelings of individuals there is of course ""speculation,"" but I feel the writers and producers of this film did a pretty good job in this area.

This is the story of the great Queen Victoria, a historically fascinating woman, and her relationship with a gruff, somewhat crude and outspoken Highlander who joined Victoria's staff after the death of her beloved Prince Albert passed away.  The story is of their personal relationship as it develops throughout the film until the death of John Brown.  This of course is a period piece and from my point of view it is almost perfectly done as far as the costuming and set design goes.  The scenery in the film is nothing less than spectacular and I would watch this movie again, with the sound off, just to view it again.

Dame Judy Dench plays the bereaved, depressed and devastated Victoria.  I have never seen Dench in a part that I did not like and this film is no exception.  Billy Connolly plays the gruff and somewhat unsophisticated highlander who is called upon by Victoria, primarily due to the fact that her Prince Albert thought so much of him.  We watch as a relationship develops between the queen and this commoner.  Was there love involved here?  I suspect there was at some level; at the very least there was extreme devotion and a mutual respect the developed between the two that went far beyond queen and servant or even between two close friends.

I felt that the portrayal of the relationship between Victoria and the rest of her family pretty well followed the facts as I know them.  Some have said that this is a gloomy movie with little or no humor involved.  I have to disagree.  The humor was most certainly there, subtle at times I grant you, but it most certainly was there.  As to the gloom accusation....I suppose that would be in the eye of the beholder.  Yes, there was sheen of sadness but that is only natural.  Victoria and Albert had one of the closest and loving relationships of any of the royal families and were absolutely devoted to each other.  The loss of Albert was a blow to Victoria of which she never fully recovered.  Hey, life is not all happy, happy, happy.

Both my wife and I enjoyed this production and will quite likely watch it again in the near future.

938563,5,630482615X,"If you like the history of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert you will really enjoy this little known movie, ""Mrs. Brown"" with Judy Dench and Billy Connolly.  I ordered ""Young Victoria"" with Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend at the same time to learn about the early years of the love story between Victoria and Albert.  Although very different in the format of the filming and age of the characters, it was really worth watching both to understand the history, although I am sure quite a bit of dramatic liberty was taken, of this romance.
Judy Dench true to her genius acting ability was fabulous as the Queen.  She never fails to give a truly brilliant performance, and as Victoria in her older years she does not disappoint.  Very believable in her grieving of the death of her beloved Albert.  No one in court had been able to get her out of her deep depression and inconsolable grief.  This is where John Brown, played so well by Billy Connolly, one of Albert's oldest and dearest friends from Scotland, was summoned to come and see if he was able to assist the Queen in getting on with her life.
John Brown was dedicated to the Queen, and only the Queen, much to the disgust of the members of her family and the members of her court who tried to control her.  His non-conventional ways rubbed many the wrong way, but after what seemed to be a long time, he was able to persuade Queen Victoria to start living again.
He showed her the joys of riding her pony in the moors, meeting with the common people of her country, laughing, dancing, and just loving again.  There were rumors of a love affair between them, but never proved in the movie.
If you like Judy Dench, I would highly recommend this movie as she will not disappoint.  Billy Connolly, an unknown to me, has become a favorite.  He is a lovable character with the strength needed to breathe life into a Queen lost in her seemingly unending grief.  I also highly recommend getting ""Young Victoria"" at the same time as it is the beginning of this story.  It is beautifully filmed, beautiful costuming, and helps you to understand and appreciate the beginning of this endearing love story.",1304467200,16,2147,4.5625

The story could certainly have more interest if the dialogue was not so bad. It showed Victoria in her extream depressive and overbearing state in the long, long mourning for her husband and I don't doubt that everyone around her, children included, were made as miserable as she was. I suppose Judi Dench did the best she could, but there was no comic relief at all. Billy Connolly, again, did as well as he could with the material at hand. I, for one, would not have blamed the Queen for ""misbehaving"", but could they not have put a little humor in it??  No, can't say I would advise anyone buying it.",1295395200,,749,4.413043478260869

938638,3,630482615X,"As always, Judy Dench is luminous in this movie, an apprehensive telling of the could-have-been romance between the enigmatic Queen Victoria, unable to recover from the loss of her beloved husband, and Billy Connolly's clod-hopper Scotsman with a Heart of Gold.  As good as the acting and production are, one comes away with the feeling that the filmmakers were so uncomfortable confronting the possibility of a romance between this mismatched duo that they managed to avoid the essence of the story.  Most likely nothing more than mutual respect existed between these two characters, but how much more satisfying as a piece of drama Mrs. Brown would have been if the so-called 'facts' could have been slightly bent to tell a warmer, more romantic saga.

It's difficult when adapting from history not to let diplomacy reign, but when there's as much potential as lurks behind the curtains in Mrs. Brown, it's pathetic not to take some creative license and let those two damn people fall passionately in love.  All those who aspire to filming historical dramas be bold - chances are you won't be tracked down by the late Queen's relatives and slapped unconscious with a handful of haggis.

As a footnote, keep an eye on Gerard Butler as Billy Connolly's long-suffering brother.  Now, there's a guy even a queen would give up her throne for.",1283126400,2,1339,4.928888888888889

Because her husband was so fond of him, Victoria sends for John Brown (Billy Connolly), a Scotsman who was one of her husband's attendants. Being a stubborn Scot, he doesn't take 'no' for an answer and waits out in the courtyard until Her Majesty finally decides to go out on a pony ride. Gradually, they develop a friendship--or is it more? That's a question asked by historians and fans of the royal family throughout the years.

Meanwhile, there's a political struggle going on.  The Prime Minister (Antony Sher) wants the Queen back in the reins. Bertie, the Prince of wales, (David Westhead) is anxious to take the reins from his Mum. Meanwhile, the rumors about the Queen and Brown are flying and as one pol says to another: ""This country runs by talk...""

There's a lot of speculation both in the film and out about the relationship between Queen Victoria and John Brown.  She was a favorite of mine and I honestly hope she did have some comfort after her husband's death.

Whatever the film is historically, it's an amazing costume drama from both what the characters wear and the landscape behind them. Dench and Connolly do a superlative job in their respective roles. Dame Judi has played two of Great Britain's queens to date and she's quite regal in both.

I've seen this film several times and every time I note something different. In this case, it's Archie Brown, John's younger brother who is played quite ably by none other than Gerard Butler.

938773,5,630482615X,"British director John Madden's well-done 1997 opus stars Dame Judi Dench as Queen Victoria, the woman of an era, and concentrates on an unlikely (and almost certainly platonic) relationship that arose during her darkest years, those that came in the time between Albert's passing in 1861 and before the resurgence of royal popularity after her Golden Jubilee in 1887.

As Mrs. Brown opens, we are confronted with an emotionally-weakened Queen Victoria who is unlike the iconic figure of popular memory. Having retreated into depression and mourning, the seldom-seen Victoria's popularity is declining, and with it a vocal minority among her loyal subjects have begun to speak out about the relevance of a monarchy in a modern industrialized democracy. Though always a woman of duty, Victoria dwells in isolation, with one of her few contacts being the charming Conservative Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, well-portrayed here by Antony Sher, whose attempts to coax his queen back into London society meet with limited success.

Into this predicament comes a Scotsman named John Brown, Victoria's personal servant and eventually her friend and confident during this time spent mostly in self-imposed exile at the royal estate at Balmoral. Brown, played here by the magnificently larger-than-life Billy Connolly, was a plain-spoken, rugged outdoorsman, whose loyalty and lack of formality led to a greater closeness with the queen than had existed with any man save the late Prince Albert. While as we see in this film, Victoria came to rely more and more on this rustic Scot, insiders at court, particularly the heir to the throne, Prince Edward, grew alarmed at the influence Brown might be exerting, and also speculated at the propriety of it all. As word leaked of the close bond shared by the sovereign and her servant, rumors percolated and some took the step of calling Victoria by the mocking title of ""Mrs. Brown"".

John Madden is at his best directing pieces set in the past and nowhere is this more true than here. This movie utilizes an exceptionally talented cast and takes full advantage of its setting in the Scottish high country, and overall the mid-Victorian era is reproduced with a careful tidiness that lends a great deal of realism to a subject that is in many ways based on guesswork and prying speculation. Although Mrs. Brown lacks wide appeal and hasn't found its way onto many best-of film lists, it is a five-star production with very few noticeable flaws. I enjoyed seeing it in Boston when it first came out during its sadly limited theater run, and haven't regretted buying it on DVD. It's the kind of motion picture that should more often get made.",1188864000,2,2681,5.047404063205418
938774,5,630482615X,"Queen Victoria has long been one of my favorite British monarchs, so it was with great interest I viewed this movie about her extraordinary friendship with John Brown, an outspoken, charming Scottish highlander who was her devoted manservant ... also highly admired by her late husband, Prince Albert.

The Queen goes into mourning after the death of Prince Albert, and the Scotsman is the one who, by sheer guts and determination, brings her back to active life.  As their friendship grows, Brown becomes the Queen's closest friend and confidante, resulting in personal and political ramifications for both.

The way the movie develops the friendship between the two main characters is exquisite in its timing and it appears the Queen and the commoner are indeed in love.  Although the film never directly addresses the issue, Brown obviously adores his Queen and she defies convention many, many times to stand by and support him.  Being an incurable romantic myself, I wish it had addressed the issue in more depth, but it was rather titillating to allow my imagination to run amok, forming my own conclusions.

This romantic drama is humorous in places, and is exquisitely shot.  Sparkling, brilliant performances were given by Judi Dench as Queen Victoria, the woman behind an empire, and Billy Connolly as the robust John Brown who helped her live again, then risked his life for her on many occasions.  Another outstanding performance was given by Antony Sher who portrayed Prime Minister Disraeli with cunning malice.

My heart went out to this beloved Queen, whom wagging tongues called Mrs. Brown, and her indomitable friend, Mr. Brown ... a heart-warming true story of friendship and loyalty, politics and betrayal.

Don't miss this outstanding movie.

938775,5,630482615X,"One imagines, I think, that it must be quite trying to live life not so much as a person, but as an institution; an icon - especially when this state of being isn't chosen, it's assigned.  There's little room for being human, or experiencing other people as they really are, not simply as the version of themselves they must be when in The Presence.  Deep, soul-rending mourning and this particular kind of status must make poor bedfellows indeed.

I should confess straight off that I am a rabid Anglophile and would be more than content to watch Dame Judi Dench read from the phone book.  She could burn down my entire town and I'd applaud.  With those biases admitted to, I should add that as I am well aware of them, I can and do step back from them in assessing this film.

But the result is the same.  Such a wonderful movie.  Talent abounds, the scenery is beautiful and Her Majesty is shown without her ""modifier"" - ""Queen.""  Here we have glimpses into a woman named Victoria, a woman who has lost her most beloved husband.  She, however, faces rather unusual circumstances.  Rare, I would wager, is the widow who has Parliament clamouring for attention, a Prime Minister ever at her door, a cabinet, and a nation all wanting their share.  What's a devastated queen/woman to do?

Find John Brown.  When John Brown came to service at Balmoral after Albert's death, it was not the first time he had been in service.  She first mentions him in her immaculate and lifelong journal several years prior to Albert's death.  His treatment of her as a person, with flesh and feeling, coupled with her innate fondness for Highlanders - the Queen was very unlike most of her English subjects in that she was refreshingly devoid, for the most part, of prejudices based around nationality or religion - produce in her some of the very first moments of peace and ""lightening of the spirit"" in the wake of what I am sure can be called the greatest tragedy of her long life.

All the above it played out in inimitably talented hands, all across the board.  Perfomances true and moving, landscapes sweeping and full of that beautifully moving and melancholy magic that is the vistas of the Scottish Highlands.

The range of human emotion that both she and Billy Connolly bring to this story-telling just simply should not be missed.  Buy it, rent it, whatever...just see it as soon as possible!  I do believe Helen Hunt was properly surprised when she won her best actress Oscar in '98...beating out Judi Dench.

Judi Dench plays Victoria with both the arrogance and very touching vulnerability that makes her character of the bereaved monarch both credible and poignant.  The very talented Billy Connolly plays Mr. Brown, the queen's horse tender and her eventual friend and confidante. Connolly gives Brown a very tough, crusty exterior, and expertly exposes the  tenderness underneath the man's roughness.  Dench and Connolly work beautifully together, and as the movie progresses, they forge a very believable relationship between their two characters.

One note for Gerry Butler fans:  You may be disappointed that your beloved actor is only in a few brief scenes.  He is mainly there for exposition, wears a very bad wig, and really has no huge impact on the story.  You might best spend your money on another Gerry film, unless you're set on seeing him cavort in the water au natural(for a few seconds).

Three years after Prince Albert's death, while the Queen was living in seclusion at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, John Brown was hired to tend her horses.  A rough, virile man, far more accustomed to life in the wild than in royal castles, Brown treated the queen with respect, but he also treated her as a fellow human being, refusing to obey court etiquette while encouraging her to improve her health and spirits by riding in the hills.  In time, he came to be her confidante, so much so that the royal family became alarmed at their relationship and members of Parliament began referring to her, mockingly, as ""Mrs. Brown.""

Judi Dench, in one of her best roles, is a wonderfully sympathetic Queen Victoria--haughty with those who try to control her, angry with those who cross her, and vulnerable to someone like Brown, who understands her loneliness and is determined to protect her.  Billy Connolly is perfect as John Brown--rough, craggy-faced, full of life, and unafraid to tell the queen exactly what he thinks, a trait the queen comes to respect.  Scenes between them show the queen in all her reserve slowly responding to Brown's honesty and inherent charm, and though there was no affair (though all the film publicity suggests otherwise), the depth of their emotional attachment is obvious.

Filmed on location in the Scottish highlands and at Duns Castle on the Scottish Borders in 1998, this production features wonderfully intimate scenes of everyday royal life, including the full retinue of servants and ladies-in-waiting, the queen's enormous family, the impatient Prince of Wales, and many luminaries of history--especially Benjamin Disraeli (Antony Sher) and Lord Henry Ponsonby (Geoffrey Palmer), both of whom try to act in the queen's best interests while also protecting their own.  As the queen responds to Mr. Brown's care, the slow, subtle effects on her everyday life become clear to the viewer through the remarkably acted scenes between Dench and Connolly.  Dench won many Best Actress awards for her role here, and Connolly was nominated for an almost equal number for his role.

A gorgeous costume drama with a large cast, the film focuses on just two people--Dench and Connolly, both of whom are so overwhelming in their roles that everything else becomes peripheral.  n Mary Whipple",1160265600,6,2479,5.036674816625917

I did not know much about the actual history of the story, and I'm sure the producers took certain liberties with history, but the story presented in the movie is timeless.

Judy Dench does an outstanding job portraying Queen Victoria after the death of her beloved Prince Albert.  To try to persuade her to come out of mourning and once again be in the public eye, her advisors ask a family friend, John Brown, to come and be a personal servant for the Queen.  The story evolves into one of forbidden love.  Mrs. Dench makes her character real, passionate, and powerful.  Billy Connolly as well does an excellent job in his portrayal of a most loving and devoted friend.

Billy Connolly was not as familiar to me, and maybe that was a good thing because I don't know him as a comedian or whatever, so he seemed to be meant for the role as the Highland Servant.  At times, when he and his brother Archie (played by ""Phantom of the Opera"" Gerard Butler) were conversing, I couldn't understand their Scottish brogue and almost wanted to turn on the subtitles.  Incidentally, Mr.  Butler looked sublime running naked into the ocean, flying appendages and all ... *sigh*!

Antony Sher as Benjamin Disraeli -- probably the best characterization of the great Prime Minister I've ever seen.

I couldn't help but wonder about the animosity displayed by the rest of the household staff toward John Brown, but upon researching his story on various websites most of what was depicted was accurate.  This man had to be pretty highly regarded by the Queen to be so disliked by everyone else around him.  I did not find anything about his having a brother also in her majesty's service, so that quite probably was 'artistic license'.

Anyhow, it's worth checking out, not one for the action film enthusiasts, but a lovely way to escape for a few hours.",1139788800,12,1244,4.648401826484018
938847,5,630482615X,"MRS. BROWN as written by Jeremy Brock and directed by John Madden (Proof, Shakespeare in Love, Captain Corelli's Mandolin) is a sprightly, entertaining and engrossing study of a moment in the life of enigmatic Queen Victoria.  Selecting an outstanding production crew and a fine cast this film succeeds on every level and once again proves to us that Judi Dench is one of the finest actresses on the stage or screen today.

The story revolves around the time when Queen Victoria's beloved husband Prince Albert dies resulting in a clinical depression in the queen.  She leaves London with her entourage to grieve at Balmoral Castle. There her Scottish Highlander servant John Brown (Billy Connolly) nurses her back to normalcy but in the meanwhile sets up the appearance of an affair that scandalized the British Isles.  Disraeli (Antony Sher) visits in an attempt to right the situation but it is Brown's strong personality - an equal match for the wise and wily Victoria - that alters the course of events that returns Queen Victoria to her proper station.

Dench and Connolly play so well off each other that their relationship has a wealth of charm, tenderness, bite, wit, and solidity.  The supporting cast includes a fine turn by Gerard Butler as Archie Brown, John's supportive and playful brother.  The costumes are superb and the cinematography by Richard Greatrex  captures the atmosphere of the cloying indoor spaces as well as the freedom of the vast coastline vistas.  Stephen Warbeck  is responsible for the well-integrated musical score.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06",1138665600,4,1597,5.1

In reality, their relationship was much more intersting and lively than the soppy one portrayed in the film.  john Brown had a brisk, no-nonsense manner of talking to the Queen which outraged everybody else, but which she loved.  Moreover, Queen Victoria was a matriarch who ruled her entire family with a rod ofiron, you would never guess that from seeing the timid, shrinking creature she is portrayed as being in this film.  And as for Henry Ponsonby (Geoffrey plamer), who is portrayed in this film as a miserable git, the one thing everybody always sazys about him is what fun he was, and what a wonderful sense of humour he had.  you'd never guess it from this film. nor was there every any estrangement between John Brown and the Queen,as this film implies.  he stayed with her until his death, and was as rude and outspoken at the end as at the beginning.  this melancholy film does not do justice to any of the characters portrayed in it.  However, if you like gloomy romances, you'll probably love it.",1066694400,17,1140,4.693467336683417
938937,5,630482615X,"That is the question. Of course, when one thinks of Victoria, the idea of prudishness, conservatism, and a very reserved manner in action and morality naturally come to mind. It was never unusual for monarchs, male or female, to have lovers outside of their marriages (indeed, it might be considered unusual for a monarch to have been thought to have remained faithful), but Victoria? The epitome of a repressive, almost oppresive morality? Surely not.
Don't be so sure.
Four years after the death of Prince Albert, to whom Victoria was completely devoted, and for whom she mourned in quite public and dramatic fashion, against the protests of her children and her ministers, John Brown, a favourite ghillie of the royal couple, was brought back into service of the Queen household.
Victoria's favouritism toward him, coupled with his own brash and blunt behaviour, caused him to be envied and disliked by members of her family, her household service, her ministers, and largely by the public. There were parodies of John Brown's activities, done up in the form of mock Court Circulars (the official listing of royal engagements), which appeared in the press on both sides of the Atlantic.
It is unknown if Brown actually kept a diary (the movie speculates such, but also states that no diary was ever found). There was a large black trunk of correspondence found after Victoria's death, between the Queen and her doctor at the time, Profeit, regarding John Brown. This came into the possession of her new doctor, Reid, who recorded 'most compromising' secrets into his green memorandum book. Alas, this book was burned by Reid's son, and the trunk was not found. Did it refer to a secret marriage between Victoria and John Brown, as was often speculated?
This is, in truth, unlikely -- Victoria's devotion to Albert never waned in her life, and there was a certain innocence, lack of pretense and guile in Victoria that the more political and suspicious (particularly in the press) would not have known. Both Brown and Victoria were outraged at the rumours. Brown was a servant who put no stock in class divisions and the artificiality of social conventions -- his familiarity with the Queen (in fact no different from his direct and familiar manner of relating to everyone) was simply his manner.
But then, everyone likes a good, juicy scandal, don't they? So much more interesting than decades of mourning, which makes for rather boring news leaders.
The film takes up the story with Brown's arrival at the royal residence on the Isle of Wight (an inaccuracy, as he was presented at Windsor first). The story is romantic yet reserved, and the cinematography is stunning. From the cloud-cast home on the Isle of Wight to the stately and foreboding Windsor scenes, to the unspoiled Highlands around Balmoral, this film has had great care infused in the details of costume, setting, and atmosphere.
Judi Dench gives perhaps the greatest performance of her life as the Queen, showing real emotion through the Victorian reserve in an admirable fashion (for which she was nominated for the Academy Award, and won the Golden Globe, as best actress). In a really surprising casting, Billy Connolly, best known as a comic, turns in a first class performance as John Brown, the brash Scotsman who becomes completely devoted to his Queen. Geoffrey Palmer, a solid actor known in many BBC productions, plays the Queen's private secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, who is continually amazed at the liberties taken by Brown (Ponsonby, in reality, saw Brown as a first class servant, and remarked so frequently in correspondence with others). This film was first proposed as a BBC television production, but ended up being so well performed and executed that it was transferred to become a cinematic release.
Given the high profile scandals of the royal family today, this story seems almost timid. But, history does repeat itself, so one can never be entirely sure, until such time as the royal archives are opened to scholars, perhaps a few centuries from now, and the truth may be known to posterity.",1054252800,129,4086,4.9751461988304095

This is a story of a unique friendship formed between two very unlike characters: Queen Victoria and her servant Mr. Brown. As the story developed I was completely absorbed by the lives of these two people, as if I was actually part of it rather then watching the film.
Story is incredibly well told (though I do wish filmmakers were not in such a rush to end it), cinematography is absolutely beautiful and as far as the historical part of the movie it was perfectly captured. And then there are actors involved in this movie.
I do not think that my knowledge of English language will allow me to fully describe superb talent of Judi Dench, which by all means is unmatched by anyone alive today. Her performance was absolutely flawless.  Academy should be ashamed for not awarding her with an Oscar and choosing Helen Hunt's performance over hers. Not even a contest in my opinion.
As incredible as Judi Dench is I'm sure it is very hard to find costars that will not be completely overshadowed by her. But Billy Connelly filled the screen with his brilliant performance. Perfect chemistry between the two. And of course - Geoffrey Palmer who happens to be Judi's long time costar from BBC's ""As Time Goes By"" (which I think is one of the best TV comedies of all time). When you get so caught up in a movie that you forget it's not a real life you know that actors are doing an incredible job.

Everytime he escorts her out for one of her morning rides and simply calls her 'woman', it's a moment of comedic joy, mild irritation and comfort that that is so nuanced and perfect that their relationship seems even deeper and tender than the story implies. The gist of the piece is that while the Queen finally begins to open up and feel alive again, naysayers and other royal advisors vehemently disapprove of her associating with a commoner and do everything in their power to put a stop to it. In the end, John Brown's devotion to her Majesty costs him his life, but the bond forged by these two individuals never dies.

Score: 82/100
Although this film has a kind of TV-film feel to it, it is far from the standards of such TV movies as Absence of the Good. It is a professional and well-made film that deserves your time. Mrs. Brown was nominated for 2 Academy Awards, Best Actress and Best Makeup, and although it didn't pick up the Oscar, in my book, it deserved to. It also deserved to take home more nominations, and more awards.
Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) is deeply depressed after the death of her husband, disappearing from public. Her servant Mr. John Brown (Billy Connolly), who adores her, through caress and admiration brings her back to life, but that relationship creates scandalous situation and is likely to lead to monarchy crisis.
The story is sometimes confusing, and the end seemed a little rushed to me, but Mrs. Brown is still a visually easy on the eye, meticulously crafted drama with a touch of emotional romance. It's not as if Queen Victoria is in love with Mr. John Brown, it's more that she is in love with the subject of falling in love. It may seem odd reading it now, but once you've watched the film, you'll understand perfectly. The film is very brutal and full-frontal, but it sometimes stops for a touch of comedic humour, some of it funny, some of it not so funny. As for performances, it goes without saying that Judi Dench is absolutely masterful in her controlled performance as Queen Victoria. It's a truly memorable performance, a homage to the real Queen. Billy Connolly is amazing as the honest Brown, he brings the days of truthful royalty to our screens with power and divine emotion.
Mrs. Brown, directed by John Madden, is a frequently stunning picture, and although it could be a snoozer for teen audiences, for real movie-goer's, it's a must-see, a magnificent film you definitely won't want to be sleeping through.",986601600,3,1857,4.734567901234568

She starts luaghing so he and his wife join in the uproar. It is what is left  unsaid that is most important in this film. The unspoken yet apparent love  between Queen Victoria and her highland servant Mr. Brown echoes that of  Emma Thompson an Anthony Hopkins in the 1993 masterpiece THE REMAINS OF THE  DAY. Mrs. Brown never quite reaches the heights of that classic because in  that film Anthony Hopkins lack of romantic involvment was more self imposed  then imposed by position and therefore gained a lrager measure of  poignancy. Mrs. Brown also doesn't have the poetic flow, or masterful  direction of that great film. Yet it is a terrific film in its own right,  elegantly (but conservatively) directed by John Madden, it gains much of  its power from three performances. The first is by Dame Judi Dench who as  the bruised monarch goes out of her way to ensure Mr. Brown position, her  immediate affection for him is gradually displayed in the film till it  reaches a peak in a very moving scene where she tell him ""Without you  I don't have the will to be what I must be"", for that is the limit she  imposes on a display of affection. Billy Connely as Mr. Brown is a man who  shows his love in an obbsessive effort to protect his Queen and indeed  through the film he will offer considerable sacrifice to do just that. The  third wonderful performance is by an actor who plays prime minister  Diseraeli, whose name I don't know but the way in which he plays him  suggests smoothness and slyness to a biting fashion. There is also the  subtext of the uproar of the British political establishment and internal  politics among the rest of the servants , yet these events thankfully  remain in the background.
