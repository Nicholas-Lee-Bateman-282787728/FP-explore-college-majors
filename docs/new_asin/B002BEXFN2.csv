8361140,3,B002BEXFN2,The transfer quality of both the movies in the Bob Steele double feature is far less than ideal so don't expect a Criterion or Kino style treatment.  The Rider of the Law has 4 minutes cut while The Pal from Texas is the correct runtime.  As with most Alpha releases it's a hit and miss affair.  This is about the middle. Not bad enough transfer to make it unwatchable yet far from good. You can pick this up for a few dollars second hand so for that price it's OK. Looks like both movies are telecined from film stock so better than VHS transfer but film stock not the best.,1468800000,,575,4.209090909090909
