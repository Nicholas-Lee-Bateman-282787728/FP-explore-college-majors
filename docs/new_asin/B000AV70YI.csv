8564792,1,B000AV70YI,"Purchased dvd of UMBERTO D, by Vittorio DeSica from Sales K-JAM.  I was billed for the dvd and after weeks of e-mail I was told they would resend.  K-JAM said they would resend.  Dvd never arrived and after weeks of unanswered e-mails I was told it was on back order.  After waiting another month I wrote back to cancel the order and receive a credit.  Repeated requests to receive a reply and credit have gone unanswered.  The service or lack thereof from K-JAM is truly the worst.",1231718400,2,482,4.482758620689655
