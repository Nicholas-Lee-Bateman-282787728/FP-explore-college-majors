8723651,4,B01169B18S,"Much Ado About Nothing presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company under the title Loves Labours Won is a companion DVD to Loves Labours Lost. Directed by Christopher Luscombe, this production provides an enjoyable and splendid entertainment. As such it fully deserves five stars. However, if one is looking for some guidance towards unveiling the secret of Shakespeares magic, this production will be of little help. As indicated in my review of Loves Labours Lost, every Shakespeares play has an ambiguous character whose actions drive the entire plot. Therefore, it is always a great challenge for theatre and movie directors do not remove this ambiguity. It is this ambiguity that may lead the audience to perceiving the plays meaning. Prince Don Pedro is such an ambiguous character in Much Ado About Nothing. Right at the beginning, Don Pedro announces what his role is. His role is My love is thine to teach. However, his teaching takes a strange form. He offers to woo Hero on Claudios behalf. Such an approach to wooing may appear strange if considered within an ordinary social milieu. Lets remember that Shakespeares plays are an illustration of a process that is beyond and above ordinary rational and emotional reflexes. So, there should be no surprise that Don Pedros approach is misunderstood. Namely, Heros father is informed that: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance. As a result Benedick accuses Don Pedro of stealing Claudios beloved: you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds nest. This seemingly confused situation is needed so Don Pedro may inform Benedict, and the audience, what the purpose of his acts is. Don Pedro tells Benedick that I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner. It seems that Don Pedro knows that Claudio is not yet ready for Hero. Therefore, Don Pedro has to teach him how to sing. Don Pedro steals Hero from Claudio when she dies to live. It is then that Claudio is forced to sing songs of woe, round about her tomb. At the end, Claudio is united with Hero. But why is such a teaching needed? Why Don Pedro imposes such a painful set of experiences on Claudio and Hero? Why is he intentionally but falsely accusing Hero? The spectators are supposed to leave the performance asking themselves these questions. By pondering on these questions they may find the answers and get closer to the meaning of Shakespeares message. However, the Royal Shakespeare Companys production robs the audience from that experience. Any ambiguity in Don Pedros actions is removed. The line the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved your daughter is changed to Claudio revealed to the Prince that he loves your daughter. Don Pedros line I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner - has been cut-off. Everything becomes simple, logical and rational. The intended impact of the play is lost.",1451520000,3,2932,4.866
8723652,2,B01169B18S,"A shrug-inducing production, neither painfully bad nor particularly good.  The Downton Abbey setting flattens the play's high spirits, substituting a stiff-backed decorum.  The director occasionally resorts to crude burlesque to enliven the proceedings:  the results are tasteless and unfunny.  I was looking forward to Michelle Terry's Beatrice, but Shakespeare's labored and archaic jokes seem to baffle her (her serious moments are better).  As Benedick, the horse-faced Edward Bennett handles the language more deftly, but lacks charm and appeal.  The production runs smoothly enough, and is certainly preferable to the disasters wrought by Kenneth Branagh and the Globe Theatre, but that is scant praise indeed.  The title Love's Labour's Won is doubly misleading:  the show is really Much Ado, and there is nothing victorious about it.",1445904000,2,841,5.672
