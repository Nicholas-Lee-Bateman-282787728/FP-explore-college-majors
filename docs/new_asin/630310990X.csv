574086,5,630310990X,"I thought Roger Ebert did an excellent review for Household Saints. Here it is from the Chicago Sun-Times 10/01/1993:

Saints are a great inconvenience. They interfere with the plans of ordinary people. When a modern family finds itself with a saint in its midst, there is a tendency to send for the psychiatrist. ""Household Saints"" is about Italian Americans in New York City who begin with a form of madness they are comfortable with, and end with a madness only a saint could understand.

Like many stories of miracles, this one begins with a pinochle game. The local butcher, Joseph Santangelo, has fallen in love with Catherine, the daughter of his card-playing buddy, Lino Falconetti (Victor Argo). The stakes in their game go higher and higher one night, until finally Joseph wants to play for the right to marry Catherine. Lino agrees, and loses, and goes home and orders his daughter to fix a nice dinner because the Santangelos are coming over.

""I want you to make a meal so good a man would get married to eat like that every night,"" he says. ""I got news for you,"" she says. ""Nobody gets married for the food."" And particularly not her cooking, which is so haphazard that Joseph's mother insults the cooking right there at the table.

But Joseph (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Catherine (Tracey Ullman) do get married. And gradually they change. As young people they look like the ""before"" pictures in an ad for a beauty school. Catherine is particularly careless, with her lank hair and her tendency to spend the day locked up with a book. But eventually prosperity touches them. Joseph grows a mustache and goes to a better barber. Catherine tints her hair and uses makeup.

It is a constant trial, living with Joseph's shrill and hateful mother (Judith Malina), who spends Catherine's first pregnancy pumping her full of horrifying old wive's tales - superstitions about all the things that can lead to miscarriages or the birth of monsters. When Mrs. Santangelo finally dies, Catherine paints the dark old apartment in bright pastels and buys Tupperware, and the family enters the 20th century.

To them a daughter is born. Teresa (Lili Taylor) is a quiet, serious girl who grows up as a devout Catholic. She is attracted to that uncompromising thread of Catholicism that challenges her to become a saint. She prays, meditates and spends her days in penance and good works. She develops a special devotion to the her namesake, St. Teresa, known as the Little Flower of Jesus. She agrees with the saint that it is not necessary to do great things in the world to be holy; one can do God's work anywhere, and there is grace to be won by scrubbing floors.

Teresa is a child who would be completely understood by her superstitious grandmother. Her parents have become modernized, however, and while of course they are Catholics, they don't see any need to get carried away with things. When Teresa shyly announces her hope to enter the convent, her father explodes: ""I don't want no daughter of mine lining the pope's pockets.""

By now it is about 1970. Change is in the air. Teresa enrolls in college, where most students are on the floor in sit-ins, not prayer. She meets a young man named Leonard Villanova (Michael Imperioli), who explains that he has a Life Plan: ""First, I get the St. John's law degree. Then I want a Lincoln Continental. I want a family and a town house on the upper East Side, and I want membership in all those clubs that always turned up their noses to the Italians."" He plans a career in ""television law."" Teresa is impressed: ""You mean like Perry Mason?""

""Household Saints"" is a wonderful movie, without a second that isn't blessed by the grace of its special humor and tenderness. But the closing scenes are transcendent, as Teresa drifts away from the Villanova Plan and into a plan of her own, for loving Jesus. The fact is that modern people do worship false gods and that a life devoted to getting a big car and a town house is seen as eminently more sane than a life devoted to God. You can decide for yourself whether Teresa goes mad. In an earlier age, people would have known how to think of her.

This warm-hearted jewel of a movie was directed by Nancy Savoca, whose previous films are ""True Love"" and ""Dogfight"" (which also starred the priceless Lili Taylor). She treasures eccentricity in people. Another director might have started right off with the story of Teresa. But Savoca's subject is larger: She wants to show how, in only three generations, an Italian family that is comfortable with the mystical turns into an American family that is threatened by it. And she wants to explore the possibilities of sainthood in these secular days. That she sees great humor in her subject is perfect; it is always easier to find the truth through laughter.

Some people will question Teresa's devotion to the Little Flower. For me, the movie rang one bell of memory after another. I went to Catholic school in the 1950s - that age of Latin, incense and mystery before Vatican II repainted the Church in politically correct pastels. I know this movie is closer to the literal truth of those days than many non-Catholics will believe. When was it, I wonder, that it became madness to want to be a saint?

574087,5,630310990X,This is one of my favorite top 10 movies. My favorite character is the superstitious Santangelo Gramma who once picked clam shells out of the garbage and made a delicious soup. Household Saints reminds me of friends and relatives that were all around me growing up.,1041811200,15,265,4.782608695652174
574088,5,630310990X,"This movie has a haunting quality that stays with you and in quiet moments you see scenes in your mind's eye and it makes you wish to go back and watch it again.  Each time you watch it there are deeper & deeper levels.  It really is quite an amazing film.  Being brought up Catholic probably has something to do with it....especially if you were born in the l950's or before.  People born after ""Vatican II"" took place probably can't relate to, nor appreciate, some of the symbolism.  GOOD, SOLID FILM.  WORTH OWNING.  WORTH WATCHING MORE THAN ONCE.",979171200,22,550,4.551020408163265
574089,4,630310990X,"At first I didn't know if I would like this movie or not. It didn't seem TOO great, seeing as I'm not very religious... but I was willing to try it for the sake of my favorite actress, Lili Taylor. I knew that her previous  work had been very good (like her roles in Dogfight and Short Cuts) so I  decided to try it. And I was surprised. It was better than I thought it  would be, but not as great as I hoped. However, the fact that I am not  really a strong religious person may have swayed my liking to this movie.  If you are religous, I suggest this movie to you. But if not, please don't  waste your time... it may not be to your liking.",948672000,,642,3.937984496124031
574090,5,630310990X,"I found this film highly creative and refreshing.  Traditional Catholic practice was brought to life, when we have such a sterile enviroment in the church of Vatican II.  The hunger for God in a godless society.  The brief  sexual content was a distraction, unnecessary and a blemish in this  depiction of a making of a saint.  A reminder of the Little Flower, Saint  Therese of the child Jesus. The spirit of a Catholic saint was portrayed  beautifully.",914025600,2,454,4.805194805194805

 Being second generation Italian-American, with a Father who was famous for his scrumptious homemade sausage, going to Catholic School, living in these time periods, and loving Puccini--well, I have to admit my perspective on this film is bound to be a bit skewed.  The story evolves as half-reality, half-myth, with a heavy does of nostalgia for a time not so long ago, rendering it capable of being read in any way that a viewer might want to. Believers will adore its quiet intensity, in the character of the young girl/woman brought to life in a tour de force by the wonderful Lilly Taylor. Non-believers will on board with her anti-religion father (at least until the last few minutes), another great job of acting by the talented Vincent D'Onofrio. Yet the real acting surprise here is comedian Tracy Ullman who was able to transform herself into a very believable and sensitive portrayal of a shy and sheltered young Italian-American woman going through profound transformation in the two decades through which the story unfolds. I was precisely the same age as Teresa Santangelo at the time the Pope was supposed to reveal the Third Prophecy at Fatima in 1960  (believers convinced that the Virgin Mary appeared to 3 simple farm children revealing great secrets, the first of two which proved to come true); like her, I was greatly disappointed when he chose not to reveal it. Rumors still abound as to the reason why. But its importance in the story is that this propels the little girl Teresa into the young adult with a hyper-religiosity which rules the rest of her life. There is great comedy in the scene where a somewhat bawdy yet polite young Jesus appears to her and causes her to see hundreds of checkered shirts like the one she is ironing for her somewhat creepy and overenthusiastic materialist boyfriend. It returns near the end where she describes God the Father as a fan of the very same thumb-scale tilting and cheating at pinochle that marks her own father. Throw in the marvelous Grandmother from the Old Country, with her strange beliefs that the uneducated had back there, and the fact that her father ""wins"" her mother as his wife in the one pinochle game that he actually did not cheat at (drawing nothing but hearts, a near mathematical absurdity), and that Teresa may very well have become a modern version of the very Saint that she modeled her life after, and I see a marvelous story, told with verve and imagination, sensitive and touching while believing in itself. Ignore the critics and listen to me--this is a gem that should not be missed, even now 24 years after its release.",1488931200,,2683,4.813449023861171

7839276,1,630310990X,"This film is lewd and crude and sexually suggestive, and waits way too long to get to the inspiring part.  I actually threw it away before finishing it.  Too bad.  Household Saints in our midst deserves better treatment.",1407628800,,220,4.7368421052631575
7839277,5,630310990X,"I have been wanting to see ""Household Saints"" for years.  I used to watch Ebert and Siskel and heard their review.  Unfortunately, this movie must not have appeared at many theaters because I could not find it anywhere.  From time to time, I even checked out video rental stores, but they did not have this movie available.

I probably forgot about the movie for years and then happened to read something about it just recently.  I was so happy to have found it available through Amazon.  It was only available in VHS format, but that was OK - we still have a couple of VCRs around.  What was really nice was that the vendor not only sent me the VHS tape, but they also copied it onto a DVD format.

I LOVED ""Household Saints""!!!!!  I would especially recommend this movie for Catholics who grew up during the 1950s who were first- or second-generation born Americans.  It brought back so many memories from my early Catholic and ethnic upbringing.",1398124800,,948,4.589285714285714
7839278,4,630310990X,"This is, apparently, a film that has not been transferred to dvd.  I saw it years ago now and thought it was good.  Buying it on VHS is the only way I could get my hands on it.  So I ordered it, it came within a couple of weeks, I watched it again.  I was right.  It is a good film.",1368057600,4,282,3.557377049180328
7839279,5,630310990X,"I saw this movie in theaters when it came out in the 90s, then I read the book by Francine Prose.  I got the video because I wanted to see the movie again after reading the book, and I wanted my husband to see it.  It's a brilliant, original story that will stay with you forever!  if possible, read the book, then see the movie!",1313798400,2,329,4.030769230769231

7839281,4,630310990X,"It is amazing that the woman who wrote the novel on which this film is based is Jewish, because it is a very Catholic, very Italian film.
