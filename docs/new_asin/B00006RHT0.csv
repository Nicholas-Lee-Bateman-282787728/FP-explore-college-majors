7972729,5,B00006RHT0,I teach reiki all levels and this Reiki DVD by Ian Welsh is great he is  a real Reiki Master. One can tell that he has a deep commitment to reiki. I use  5-15 minutes of this DVD in my Reiki Classes I show different sections in each class . I find it very helpful. So glad he did not include history of Reiki .As information keeps getting 'found' it would be not be updated. My students also tell me they get alot out it .

This DVD tells you the basics of doing a Reiki treatment on yourself or friends & family. This DVD seems more geared to Reiki I students & does not teach any symbols. There is no attunement either.
It does remind you to turn on & always also turn OFF Reiki energy, otherwise you will always be giving out energy & anyone you walk by will naturally absorb whatever they need & you will drain very easily.
This DVD is great in that it always reminds you the most important is your intentions & what positive thoughts you have effect yourself & those around you & what you are trying to achieve in anything you do. It tells you can use Reik on humans, injuries, helping others to concentrate, animals & even inanimate objects such as your home or car.
There is a simple Q & A also for those who have never taken a Reiki I class or just finished one saying Reiki I is for your own healing, you need Reiki II before you can do it as an occupation, etc.
There is a brief tutorial about cleansing stones, food & dream catches & how to get rid of negative energy from those items & ""program"" it to be more positive energy & use it.
Most of the information is very basic, only tells locations & colors of Chakras, not what they do or indicated for, etc. You will need other DVDs or books to get anything more then shallow infomation.
The only thing I learned (whether it works or not, I will give it a shot...) is to say to yourself that you will only absorb from food that wich your body needs, no more, no less. With him saying it's great for chocolate so you don't have to worry about the fats... it seems far fetch, but the human mind is capable of killing the body tomrrow by wishing it as well as miraculous cures from cancer, so... It's worth a shot.
This was a good intentioned DVD & good to have, I just wish it has more information. There is no info about the history of Reiki as well, just that it's from the universe with loving energy.",1143504000,8,2060,4.1914357682619645
7972731,5,B00006RHT0,"This DVD is made for people who have already experienced their Level One Attunement.  You might wonder why you need a DVD if you've already had a Level One class.  Well, you could be like my husband, who took the Level One class from a teacher who was very riddled with issues about money and who was not an efficient teacher.  I'd like to say everyone who reaches the Master-Teacher level is going to be a good teacher, but not everyone is born to teach, and so many people are left feeling as though they didn't get everything out of the class that they could have, or that they don't retain it, or didn't understand.  I got this DVD specifically so that my husband could catch up on what he didn't really learn in class, but we both ended up learning from it!  Ian Welch is a very good presenter and an inspiring reiki Master-Teacher in his own right, and this is an excellent DVD for anyone who is learning to do reiki for themselves, family and friends, or even eventually a paying clientele.

There is a very informative question-and-answer session towards the end..... overall, very good DVD for any reiki person!",1132963200,11,1120,4.51980198019802
