2346625,4,B000A0HW5Q,"I always loved this movie as a kid, and while it's a little sillier than I remembered from when I was twelve, it's still entertaining and clever. The main character, Arlo, is a cute science geek who tends to take frogs to strange places, like on dates. Fortunately, his newest acquisition happens to be a cursed, 600-yr.-old Italian Prince (he wouldn't kiss a witch, and now *poof* he's a frog). Gus (the frog prince), tries to help Arlo boost his confidence so he can be with the cute girl from school, while Arlo tries to get Gus kissed. A series of misadventures ensues. Obviously, there is a cute, uplifting ending, as can be expected from all Wonderworks films, and I guarantee that you will not get the song ""That's Amore"" out of your head for weeks. Kids who like reptiles/amphibians and science will enjoy this movie, as well as those who just enjoy slightly comedic stories. Children frightened of snakes or lizards may be distressed by the plethora of them on screen. Overall, I definately recommend this movie; it's cute and clean, and generally amusing.",1177286400,5,1065,4.762162162162162
2346626,4,B000A0HW5Q,"A great fun movie for the early teen. As a 6th grade teacher I use it in mid February (Valentine's Day)and near the science fair time, as a ""Frog Love Story"". It is based on the idea that a nerd (science student) buys a frog who was once a Prince. Of course the frog wants to be kissed (and turned into a Prince again) and Arlo (the student) wants a good science fair project. He also wants to get kissed. Along comes a cheerleader who needs a good grade in sciencewho is willing to be Arlo's partner and the story hops off from there. Shelly Duvall and Elliot Gould are wonderful as the post hippy parents. This is a good video for any age group.",1012176000,7,647,4.184

8071466,5,B000A0HW5Q,"Love this movie!  I saw it when it originally aired as an afternoon made-for-television movie.  It's fun, it's entertaining, it's goofy, it's smart, it's innocent and it's good-natured.  It also plays ""That's Amore"" repeatedly and by the time the film is over, you'll know the lyrics and will be singing the song with a smile on your face.  It also has a very happy ending.",1508889600,,373,4.6923076923076925

8071468,5,B000A0HW5Q,"I love this movie. It's very 80s and a little silly. But it's a movie I really enjoyed on VHS. It's a spin on the Princess and the Frog, sans the romance and with all the fun of your typical 80s movie. I think kids will enjoy it but not as much as us old fuddy duddies who remember how shoes and movies were in the 80s and 90s.",1497657600,,327,3.753623188405797

8071474,5,B000A0HW5Q,"Given the cast of characters in this classic movie, my grandsons are now enjoying this as my own kids did.  Kiss a frog & he turns into a lounge singer-what funny stuff w/ some great music.  My 3 year old grandson is singing Amore all over the house.  Good popcorn time for the family who would like to enjoy a movie that is a gem. Sadly, the sequel is not available on DVD, but it would be hard to equal the entertainment in the original.",1390089600,,439,4.141176470588236
