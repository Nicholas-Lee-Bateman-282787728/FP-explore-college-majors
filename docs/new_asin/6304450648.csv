878640,4,6304450648,I enjoy watching Cops because of the drama and silliness. This VHS was hilarious and I watch it over and over.,1260403200,,110,4.285714285714286
878641,2,6304450648,"I got this for my dad because he saw it on TV advertised and he loves the show. He was not happy at all with it! He had seen the majority of the scenes on TV already and the video was not as uncensored as it says.  They still bleep everything out, thought we were getting some raw footage but its nothing they wouldnt show on TV.  Dont waste your time.",1207526400,6,352,3.943661971830986
878642,3,6304450648,"Just wanted to try out my new Creative vision. Cops would look even more stupid if it weren't for how stupid criminals usually seem to be. Amazon's unbox service worked well, and I guess this episode is worth a few laughs....",1186272000,,225,4.512195121951219
878643,5,6304450648,"If I had to recommend only one segment of one episode from the 19th series of COPS, it would be the final segment of Episode 27.  (Note: the rest of the episode is also pretty good stuff--not to be missed by afficionados.)

Palm Springs police are dispatched to a room in a seedy motel on a drug tip.  ""Kelly"" answers the door here, a woman whose pitted face and sunken eyes are an ineluctable betrayal of a raging, unmitigated meth habit.  Guilt thus established prima facie, the cops move in to recover her contraband.  But where is it?

The motel room is small and the search does not take long.  Hilarity ensues as this mendacious meth zombie and her boyfriend try to blather and blubber their way out of a ride to the jug.  Officer Mike Goodwin's felicitous reference to the old proverb ""As you make your bed, so you must lie on it"" wraps up the segment in style, and will have you laughing all the way through the credits.  With superior performances by the cops, perps, and producers alike, this one gets two thumbs up.",1181001600,7,1026,4.44385026737968
878644,2,6304450648,"Its OK, but too many duplicate scenes from the TV show. Thought it was outtakes that couldn't be shown on TV.",1029801600,5,109,4.238095238095238

878831,5,6304450648,"Cops was a great way for me to get over my dead wife. My dog had dog AIDS and he died right after and I cried for weeks until my friend Emily suggested I watch cops and so I bought cops and 3 days later, I was feeling better. I'm much happier now.

878903,3,6304450648,"""Cops"" is one of the most brilliantly simple shows ever made.  It has been entertaining us since before many of our parents got married!  ""Cops:  Caught In The Act"" contains a tiny sampling of this awesomeness.

That tiny sampling is the primary flaw with this DVD.  Those expecting to see a dozen or more totally-unedited episodes of ""Cops"" will be stunned to see that there are only two (2!) episodes on this disc, and that both episodes are totally edited!

To be totally fair, there are about 15-30 minutes' worth of unedited ""deleted scenes"" from ""Cops"", but that hardly makes up for just how minimalist--and heavily-censored--the rest of the DVD is.

I recommend this DVD, but, truthfully, ""Cops:  Caught In The Act"" is for die-hard fans only.",1409788800,2,749,4.84251968503937
