3904280,3,B002C6VMJI,"Which I don't think it was intended to be .. at least not in the scenes I found funny.

I'm not knocking the cheap effects (use some imagination .. it's a fantasy film), nor the fraction of a budget of LOTR, but could they have saved a bit of money on the effects and paid for some screenwriters to edit the script, or at least go over the storyline and redline it.

- how to protect yourself from a grenade that has been lobbed into a cave that you are standing in? .. A: throw yourself on top of the nearest woman.

I could go on, but it is not worth my time .. btw, how did the elf-woman hero survive being stabbed by the baddies sword .. I'd fallen asleep by that bit?

As another reviewer commented .. 'is it over yet?' Goes on for at least an hour too long.",1261440000,,763,4.0
3904281,5,B002C6VMJI,"My answer to some of the other reviewers: is it a story that copied the Lord of the Rings, clearly the answer is yes.  Yes a counsel is called that decided to form a fellowship which is needed to fight the source of great evil.  The main member of this fellowship will give her life in the fulfillment of quest, though she does not do so in the end, she clearly is a Frodo type.  Sir John is very much an Aragorn look alike.  Is this a one for one copy of the Lord of the Rings?  NO!  It is a story in its own rights.  Is the story influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien?  Greatly.  What modern fantasy is not?  What modern Sci Fi is not influenced by Star Wars?

Was the Lord of the Rings influenced by other works, or did J. R. R. Tolkien work in a vacuum?  The answer is J. R. R. Tolkien took his ideas for the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings from Die Nibelugen the story of Siegfried.  In Tolkien own words The Hobbits were the English peoples.  In the Hobbit Tolkien is saying Siegfried, i.e. the German people, killed the Dragon but it was due to the effort of the Hobbit, the English people.  He carries this idea on into the Lord of the Rings, which is drawn from his experience in World War I and II.  The point being, all stories stand on the back of other stories.

The question is, is this movie a good movie, i.e. worth watching.  The answer is YES.  It is well made, good story, the photo work is great, and good acting.  Buy it, enjoy it.",1254182400,23,1446,4.042402826855124
3904282,1,B002C6VMJI,"Someone had a bit of courage producing this movie and keeping it at almost 3 hours.
The acting is bad, the effects are bad, the writing is bad and I'm happy because I rented this.
Save your money of better yet, if you need a nap rent this because you're likely to get a really good nap.

Not sure what's wrong with others who have compared this to TLOTR. This movie is nothing like the TLORT with the obvious exemption of  attempting to make the poster a look alike.

Amazon needs a ""Hate it it"" option or a ""No Star"" for movies like this.",1253491200,4,539,4.163461538461538
3904283,5,B002C6VMJI,"I thought this was a pretty good fantasy epic made on a minimal budget. You can not really compare this to LoTR because LoTR was made on a nine figure budget were KofB may have been made on a couple million, if that.  I think it was nicely made on the budget it was given, and it is also nice to see a fantasy adventure in a television world ruled by reality television and CSI clones.",1250640000,43,385,4.065789473684211
3904284,2,B002C6VMJI,"To compare this low budget 2nd class production with LOTR is an insult to LOTR... the graphics are so evident to be CGI, the scenery is so clearly artificial, and the story, OK, just more of the same. Not even the characters and creatures are original.",1250640000,3,252,4.5
3904285,5,B002C6VMJI,"I got to see only the first-half of KOB, so I can't wait to finish the experience. I've already ordered the DVD. From the first-half of the movie, I'd have to say that this isn't far behind LOTR and other epic movies!",1250553600,11,217,4.190476190476191
3904288,2,B002C6VMJI,poor story line and bad acting.  I expected much better from David James Elliot.  The writing seems more like they took a whole bunch of little unrelated stories and dumped them together with some minor bindings.  Not very good at all.,1408060800,,235,4.682926829268292
3904289,1,B002C6VMJI,"This has to be one of the worst shows I have ever seen. I can tell they really wanted to be complex plot-wise but none of it was actually coherent. The most memorable line of this movie is right after the villain gives a command to kill someone. Then he says, ""And even if you don't!"" dramatic lowering of his voice, ""Kill him anyways.""
The only redeemable thing about this show is the nostalgia I feel watching the guy from Back to the Future. That and lines so stupid that quoting them explains just how dumb I think something is. Saying, ""And even if you don't!"" has helped me mock numerous things by putting them on the same level.",1404259200,,635,4.34453781512605
3904290,5,B002C6VMJI,My daughter likes to watch these movies. She likes role playing video games and would recommend this movie for all the fans of quest movies.,1400112000,,140,4.64
3904291,2,B002C6VMJI,"There are a few good actors in this movie, however, the plot is shallow and predictable. The set, CGI, and other aspects of the movie are obviously low budget. Fantasy film fans are used to this sort of fare however, and have become very tolerant of films that the general movie watching public would avoid altogether. So, if you are a fantasy film fan you will likely find the movie watchable. If you insist on high quality films, you may find this film hard to endure.",1400025600,,470,4.476744186046512
3904292,3,B002C6VMJI,A fantasy sword entry that was average at best. Had some good actors playing the roles but didn't develop all that well. Tough staying interested. 3 stars.,1398643200,,155,4.777777777777778
3904293,5,B002C6VMJI,This movie is great if you love Sword and Sorcery not compare to the The hobbit or lords of the Rings or the dungeons and dragons but it is similiar to these movies. I only like it because of the plot and actor David James Elliot been a great warrior for the quest.,1397260800,,265,4.018867924528302

3904297,5,B002C6VMJI,"I am very generous in my rating of movies & this is why, I rate a movie if it entertains even if it has a B-rate budget or the acting isn't exactly academy award winning. If it can hold my attention sway my emotions or provoke thoughts then I figure they succeeded in making the film. If you love the Sword & Sorcery genre than you might want to give this DVD a try.  If you go into this not expecting a big budget block buster & want something to bulk up your collection this might be a fun movie for you. For the price I paid I was satisfied.  If on the other hand you are a arm chair critic than you will not have to work overly hard to pick this film apart & you might want to pass this one by.  But if your like me & are looking for a couple hours of fantasy fun & love this genre then you won't be disappointed.",1384819200,,817,3.8511904761904763

3904300,4,B002C6VMJI,"The film fits within the Fantasy genre. There are no real surprises apart from an ugly goblin being the sacrificial hero perhaps. It follows the ideas already well covered in all Fantasy from TLoTR's, but the personalities are varied. All are well acted, with DJE being far and away the best - as expected.  It's long, as it covers 3 mini-series episodes, so gives a good solid night of fun viewing. I'll be watching it again several times just for the relaxing fun.",1350432000,,466,4.614457831325301
3904301,5,B002C6VMJI,this DVD had very good pricing and that is one of the most important things these days - movie was good but I think you have to be a David James Elliott fan to enjoy it,1333411200,,168,3.6944444444444446

3904305,3,B002C6VMJI,"Although fairly well done and legitimate effort in its 2009 production is obvious, ""Knights of Bloodsteel"" is most definitely marketed toward teenagers and pre-teens.  Elves, goblins, humans and other denizens of Middle Earth fight against a demon and a dragon.  Some of the acting is actually pretty good, but some of the acting is really lacking too.  This was a TV mini-series, so the DVD movie is 240 minutes long.  That's 4 hours for the arithmetic impaired.  Natassia Malthe (Elektra; BloodRayne 2) is great as the heroine, and Christopher Lloyd gives a very acceptable performance as well.  David James Elliot is a little too smug and arrogant for the time period, possibly from his days on the set of JAG.  Mark Gibbon (Voyage of the Unicorn) gives a decent performance as Dragon Eye (the demon), as does Mackenzie Gray (Voyage of the Unicorn) as Lord Splayven.  Heather Doerksen is some of the eye candy for this film, as she also was in the movie ""The Eye.""  A lot of the cast comes from Canada, since this was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Most reviews say bad things about the script, acting, and plot, as well as dissing the director and lack of continuity.  One review said this movie is clich, repetitive, unimaginative, uninspiring, and poorly executed.  The only thing I didn't like about it is how it is legitimate Sci-Fi Fantasy genre, but marketed wholly to teens and pre-teens.  What that means by definition is that the main characters are made to appear exceptionally young among the good guys, but older among the bad guys.  The stereo-type being that old people are mean, slow, and stupid, but young people are smart, clever, and superior.  This type of film truly HAS to be fantasy because of the setting, the species, the dragon, and the fact that in real life whoever is in charge isn't that easy to overthrow.  Movies like this coupled with the cartoons of the 1960's and 1970's thrown in with stories about David & Goliath, Daniel & the lion's den, Joseph and his coat of many colors, and other accounts, legends, and folklore about underdogs overcoming impossible odds, give teens and pre-teens an unrealistic bent toward survival in contemporary life.  But then, I have to admit, nobody wants to watch a Sci-Fi Fantasy film that parallels real life hurdles, trials, obstacles, and burdens; or how insurmountabloe the condescending arrogance of some people turns out being.  So when I took time to ponder whether or not this film delivers what an intelligent fan of Sci-Fi Fantasy would anticipate, I'd have to say this film does a fair job of being what it is supposed to be.  I'm not impressed, but I give 3 stars anyway.  I doubt that the partial, quick upper side shot of a woman in the shower was really Natassia Malthe, and even if it was, it isn't worth buying the DVD for.  Remember this was a TV mini-series.",1306368000,4,2866,4.761133603238866
3904306,2,B002C6VMJI,"The Syfy (or ""genre syphilis"") channel is like the girl with a curl on her forehead -- sometimes it's really really good, and sometimes it's horrid.

""Knights of Bloodsteel"" is.... neither. While hardly a shining example of the fantasy genre, this fantasy miniseries isn't a SyFy weekend movie either. It's mostly all about good ideas that aren't fully developed and potential that is squandered -- not to mention acting that ranges from decent to mind-meltingly bad.

In the kingdom of Mirablis, a magical element called bloodsteel is considered essential, both to the vampire-elf/gobin/human alliance and to the villain Dragoneye. What is bloodsteel? Nobody knows! It's basically Applied Phlebotinum that does whatever the characters want. Anyway, bloodsteel is becoming rare, and the only way to get more is to find the Crucible from which it all comes.

An oracle predicts that four knights will arise to search for the crucible and save Mirablis from Dragoneye. And after a clash with Dragoneye's minions, the knights are revealed -- a cynical human drifter (David James Elliott), a reluctant goblin ""vessel"" (Dru Viergever), a roguish conman (Christopher Jacot), and a conflicted elf sorceress (Natassia Malthe). So they set out on a dangerous quest to get the Crucible.

I'll say this outright -- ""Knights of Bloodsteel"" is much better than most of Sci-Fi's usual original productions. It has an intriguing high fantasy world where elves, humans and goblins live in peace together, there's a genuine effort at fleshing out the characters (including the villain), the special effects are cheesy but not horrible, and the scenery is lovely.

Unfortunately, the execution is not so great. The main story is standard ""Lord of the Rings""-style fantasy quest, but it's choked by half a dozen subplots that don't really add anything to the plot. What's the point of the deadly robot hand? Or the treacherous sorcerer? Or that annoying blonde chick?  It feels like there's a lot going on here, but it all dissolves into a big confusing muddle.

Plus, there are a lot of things that just don't make sense -- for instance, a main character's sister dies tragically... and one scene later, he's in bed with a camp whore.  And apparently you can heal a gaping hole in your midsection with.... ""willpower."" That's almost as lame as the power of friendship.

The acting is a mixed bag. Elliott is pretty solid as a scarred loner (although his Scottish accent slides all over the place), and Viergever gives a strong performance as a goblin haunted by his destiny. But Jacot is basically a 2-D ""roguish thief"" character, and watching Malthe try to act angry or heartbroken is just painful. She looks like she stepped on a tack.

And... Christopher Lloyd? What is he doing in a movie like this? I can only assume that since his house was destroyed in 2008, he needed the quick cash that playing a vampire-elf provided.

""Knights of Bloodsteel"" isn't HORRIBLE, but it's certainly not good -- overloaded with subplots and a really bad lead actress. But if you turn off your brain, it's mildly amusing.",1295136000,11,3090,4.992217898832685
3904307,1,B002C6VMJI,"When somebody (including me) saw the potrait immediately thinks great story like Legend of the seeker or any other great fantasy but I am truly and really sorry this is not even close of the category of Seeker or any other , the plot and the movie went slow and did not pick up anything to keep you entertained.

So do not buy it or even check it out.",1293840000,,351,4.086956521739131

3904340,2,B002C6VMJI,Being a David James Elliott fan from his role in JAG I purchased his movie Bloodsteel. I must confess to expecting more out of his performance than what I observed. I think the script was lacking in substance which was disappointing. The story line is weak and the characters almost seem mechanical in their quest. Being a total fan of the Lord of The Rings triology I was hoping that this movie would be of similar quality however it is not. Christopher Lloyd does his best to portray his character with believablity however the supporting cast just can't help him out. I thought if I watched it twice it would grow on me but I came away with the same opinion as the first time. I'd love to be more fair about this movie especially because I'm a fan of David James Elliott but I admit to laughing at several scenes that probably weren't meant to be funny. I'm glad I purchased this one used. Not really worth the investment and I'll probably never watch it again.,1284076800,,964,4.451977401129944
3904341,4,B002C6VMJI,"While I have to say the film is in no way a great epic; it does provide for an insteresting world that sadly didn't get explored. The world of Humans, Elves, and Goblins living together due to their dependence upon the substance of blood-steel drew me in (Perhaps its the gamer...more correctly game-master in me that likes to see a good setting with lots of background). Though Christopher Loyd does make for an odd choice as an elf!
Most of the goblin make up was pretty interesting, but the main villain (Dragon Eye)looks good right up until he speaks or moves. They could have done a lot better...it didn't need to be as over the top; it would have moved better on his face if they had toned it down a bit (or even just shaded it a bit better).
The plot is predictable; but I found it engaging.
