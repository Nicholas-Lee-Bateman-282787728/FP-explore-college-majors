8533914,4,B0091915KA,"This re-telling of the tale is a delightful way to spend a little time with the kids catching up on a tale from youth...until you realize it's not quite the same old tale. John Cleese is awesome as usual, but what puts the icing on the cake is the score by Elvis Costello. I've enjoyed some of his stuff growing up, but this is full, genuine beautiful art of musical genius. Splendid!!!",1397520000,2,386,4.375
8533915,5,B0091915KA,All was fantastic in this book retold with lightly moving pictures. They do a great job of having just enough movement without making it a yucky cartoon. Art really is fantastic.,1392854400,,178,4.774193548387097
8533916,5,B0091915KA,This is perfect for parents who would prefer to slow things down a bit from video games and action movies. It is like great actors are sitting in your living room reading to your kids. I loved this and the others in this series. Highly recommend.,1374624000,2,246,4.369565217391305
