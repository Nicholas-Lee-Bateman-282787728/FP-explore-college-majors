2480696,5,B000E1OIBC,"My students watch this every year and LOVE it.  This is much better than ""Twister,"" the movie, and based on a true story.  Riveting.  I love it when they yell, ""GET THE BABY!  GET THE BABY!""",1400284800,2,190,4.194444444444445
2480697,5,B000E1OIBC,This movie gives you a very up close view of what a Twister looks like and the damage it does. Great movie. Glad I bought it.,1389744000,,125,3.8461538461538463
2480698,4,B000E1OIBC,I liked the movie to begin with but... the video quality was not very good.  The film had a yellow tint to it that I couldn't adjust my tv too.,1386374400,,143,3.7666666666666666
2480754,5,B000E1OIBC,"i chose this 5 star rating, because it's a very good movie, and theres a lot of action to it.  it is very rare to have tornadoes in nebraska.  yes it is very flat there, and i don't know if there is storm shelters in that country.  i love this movie, because i was always into tornadoes, and studying them since i was a little girl.  some tornado movies are very scary, and wouldn't want to get stuck in one.  storm shelters are the best way to go if people live in very flat areas, that causes tornadoes, in those areas.  i recommend this movie to anyone, that loves tornado movies.",1380412800,,583,4.207207207207207
2480755,5,B000E1OIBC,I remember waching this back in elementry school. I went to my local video store to rent it but they did not carry it  so I decided to just buy it. I bought this on VHS and will be upgrading to DVD hopefully real soon. Peter Smith,1375401600,2,230,3.893617021276596
2480756,4,B000E1OIBC,"I enjoyed this movie  John Schneider is one of my favorite actors and singers.  John Schneider starts out as a not so nice guy, but of course, ends up being a good guy and good father.  Waited several years to get this movie, and I am glad I did.",1362182400,,246,3.979591836734694
2480757,5,B000E1OIBC,I first saw this on tv years ago. I wanted to get a copy of this and finally found this movie on Amazon.,1358899200,,104,3.5652173913043477

2480760,4,B000E1OIBC,"This was a nice movie I saw on tv a couple of years ago.  Thought I would purchase it for my students to watch after studying about tornadoes.  Was AMAZED at how high this movie is, I mean almost $90.00 for it new and $30.00 used, PLEASE I will look for a copy in a yardsale or the bargain bucket at WalMart.",1328572800,6,308,3.9516129032258065
2480761,5,B000E1OIBC,"I watched this movie on TV one night when I was 15 or 16, and have been trying to find a copy for my personal library for a long time since!!  It was incredibly well done, which was amazing for a TV movie from the mid-90's, and helped to foster my fascination with severe weather, ESPECIALLY tornadoes!!  Plus, I just love Devon Sawa...;)  This movie is interesting, and compelling, and just great.  I love it!!",1287273600,,411,4.44
2480762,5,B000E1OIBC,"I enjoy this movie everytime I watch it. No,it's not as grand as a big screen production, but it has a good story line. Being based on a true weather situation was the interesting angle also.",1286323200,,191,4.333333333333333
2480763,4,B000E1OIBC,"Night of the Twisters is an excellent movie, cheaply done, but has all the necessities of a proper mother nature furry has her wrath! I was pleased to see that this movie did not blame global warming as the result of the cause of all the twisters. Acting was good, Step-father and step-son's relationship was beautifully developed in the movie. Anyone who loves these types of movies will not be disappointed.",1282953600,,409,4.774647887323944
2480794,5,B000E1OIBC,I watch this movie every now and then because it has such a realistic feel to it. The special effects are better than a lot of disaster movies I have seen. Night of the Twisters also shows how a family unit should hold up under the worst conditions.,1282953600,,249,4.208333333333333
2480795,5,B000E1OIBC,"That's one of our favorite lines from this movie.  LOL!!!  If you are looking for a realistic, weather-catastrophe-type of movie, and are very picky about details being accurate, this is not the movie for you.  ""Twister"" is better in that respect (but only a LITTLE).  BUT, if you are a science-nerdy-type of person who greatly enjoys picking out all the things that are ""wrong"" with a movie, and finds it quite humorous, then this is the movie for you!  My husband and I are major weather buffs (he was a professional meteorologist, and I'm an amateur hobbyist/trained spotter), and this is our favorite ""funny"" movie.  There are SOOO many peculiarities and inconsistencies in this movie that I could write about; but it's much more fun to watch the movie and find them yourself.  We've seen it maybe 30 times or more; and we're still finding things in this movie that are just ""off"" that we hadn't noticed before.  Yep, this is definitely one of our most favoritest movies.  However, kids who are scared of tornadoes may be frightened of this movie, because they most likely will not understand WHY this movie is so fake.  In my mind, no movie tornado will ever compare to the terrifyingly realistic twister on ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and this movie certainly doesn't even come close.  But its entertainment value is worth every penny spent on it.  ;-)",1277078400,,1350,4.746781115879829
2480796,3,B000E1OIBC,"This review is on the tv-movie ""Night of the Twisters"" I saw on TV awhile ago. It's not a bad movie and has a good story plot based in fictional Nebraska town of Blainsworth sometime in the early fall. Some parts of the movie really were quite impressive and most of their special effects [the tornadoes itself] were from fairly realistic to downright realistic. I guess my favorite part of the movie was near the end when they were being chased by the tornado. As I said before, this movie has a good story plot to it and was good enough to keep me glued to my couch for the entire movie.
I have seen Twister many times and Night of the Twisters a few times and a few other tornado-based movies and overall I prefer Twister, but Night of the Twister is still a pretty darn good movie to watch!",1273536000,,794,4.264900662251655
2480797,4,B000E1OIBC,My fifth grade students were really surprised at the differences between the book and the movie.  Good comparison/discussion activity.,1270944000,,134,6.052631578947368
2480798,5,B000E1OIBC,"I remember watching Night of the Twisters when I was a kid with my mom we would watch it every time it would come on tv
this movie has some scary parts for young children but it does show them what happens with tornados and what they do

I would definatly recommend this movie as it is one of my all time favorites.",1270857600,,315,4.0
2480799,5,B000E1OIBC,"This movie is one of my personal favorites, since I grew up with Devon Sawa as being one of my favorite actors.  If you can look beyond the cheesy acting and the horrible special effects, you are bound to fall in love with this movie as well.

The setting takes place in Blainsworth, NE during a brisk fall day.  A teenage boy is left home alone with his baby brother, and his best friend, when disaster strikes.  This movie is about reuniting a family torn apart by a natural disaster, and overcoming obstacles along the way.",1260489600,,526,4.447916666666667
2480800,1,B000E1OIBC,"Parts of this film rate up there with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-from-Outer-Space/dp/6305760403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>&nbsp;The special effects are especially laughable.

There is a scene where the heroes are being chased by the tornado;  When the heroes turn and drive down a side street, so does the tornado!",1250640000,,424,7.134615384615385
2480801,5,B000E1OIBC,"CLEAN, nice family movie. Based on a true story about a families struggles on a night that mutiple TWISTERS hit their town. Their struggles to find each other and get to saftey . A truley good/exciting  movie for the entire family.",1250467200,,231,4.634146341463414
2480802,5,B000E1OIBC,"This movie is awesome. Devon Sawa and Amos Crawley are perfect for their roles. In fact, the entire cast is perfect. John Schneider is excellent. This movie is entertaining and wholesome for the whole family. Two thumbs up!",1242000000,,223,4.894736842105263
2480803,5,B000E1OIBC,I loved this movie when it first came out on TV so when I saw it here I just had to have it. If you like natural disaster type movies then you would really like this one.,1234742400,,170,3.6216216216216215
2480834,4,B000E1OIBC,"I remember watching Night of the Twisters when it first aired on the Family Channel back in 1996.  I had read the book when I was in 5th grade, and I thought this was a very good adaptation.  For a TV movie, the special effects for the tornadoes were very well done.  I had wanted to purchase the VHS tape when it became available, but never got around to it.  When I saw that there was a DVD for the movie, I bought it.  It's really nice watching the movie without commercials.

I really liked the casting choices -- especially Dan Hatch.  Who wouldn't want to see Devon Sawa in his teenage years?  He was a little older than I had pictured Danny being in the book, but it still worked quite well.  John Schneider as Jack Hatch was another good casting move.  I felt he was a little too harsh at times, but other than that it was a good portrayal.

I found it interesting that this was released the same year as Twister was.  If you compare the two, of course Twister is going to have the better CGI special effects, but I am not going to compare the two movies, as they are completely different from one another.

If you liked the book, you'll most likely like the movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who is old enough to read the book since they will know what to expect when the twisters come.",1229817600,,1302,4.218623481781377
2480835,2,B000E1OIBC,"this movie is cheesy and lame.....but great if you are married to a teacher and her class is reading the book ;) Making you the super husband for a day or so.

(Also great if you are looking for a funny and cheesy movie. I would just rent it)",1229040000,,242,3.938775510204082
2480836,1,B000E1OIBC,"I have no idea what the people who wrote all these other previews were watching but this is the worse movie I have ever seen . . . well almost.  Napoleoan Dynamite was bad, but at least it had funny moments.

This is bad effects, horrible acting and very unrealistic scenes.  Complete tornado devestation while not a drop of rain or moisture on the ruins, police cars or even the ground!!.  Four tornado's his a town and not a single drop of rain!  lol.  We didn't even finish the movie, but left the room.",1224460800,,506,4.329787234042553
2480837,4,B000E1OIBC,"I rank this one among the best of the made for cable disaster movies. Granted it's formulaic, but it executes said formula well. Given that it's a TV movie from 1995, the CGI effects are above average as well. There have been over half a dozen TV movies about tornadoes since Night of the Twisters, but this one remains the most engaging of them.
Recommended for genre fans or families looking for a solid movie that's enjoyable for everyone.",1222041600,,442,4.6075949367088604
2480838,4,B000E1OIBC,"Good Movie.  Had seen it before, but it was even better and suspenseful than earlier viewing.  Good family movie and enlightening about tornadoes and their impact on people.  Having gone through tornadoes before, this one really brings out things that one can identify with.  Good show.",1215475200,,286,5.1521739130434785
2480839,3,B000E1OIBC,"I can't tell you what the movie is like if you sit through the whole thing because I haven't been able to manage it. But by using the remote to zip past the long, drawn out attempts at character development, I was able to enjoy the disaster part of the movie. The graphics were decent enough and the survival part of the story was entertaining.",1204848000,,344,4.3076923076923075
2480840,5,B000E1OIBC,"This movie was a slightly changed version of the Ivy Ruckman book by the same name, a fictionalized account of the real-life disaster that happened 6/3/1980 in Grand Island.  The book was very good and well worth reading, but I found some of the storyline in the movie in some ways even better.  It developed the characters well and the growth of them & their relationships with each other.  The movie was actually made about a decade ago, so the special effects are more typical of that time but no less good.  As a fellow Nebraskan who remembers that night, I found most of the weather-related detail accurate.  Likewise, I found a few changes in miscellaneous details that only a Nebraskan would catch... check out the license plates, for example... worth the ticket price right there, if you ask me.  It was a very reasonable and even good adaptation from an existing book, which is a feat in and of itself.",1184371200,3,911,4.627329192546584
2480841,4,B000E1OIBC,"Teenager Dan Hatch and his friend Amos are babysitting Dan's baby brother, watching TV and fooling around. But a major tornado is coming their way, unbeknownst to them but knownst to us, and we just want to scream, ""Get the baby and get out of there NOW!"". I just love the scene where the ping pong table swirls around for a few seconds, then flies away! In fact, unlike Twister which mostly showed us the damage from the outside, Night of the Twisters makes us feel much more ""inside"" the tornado. And it's fun! The scenario is very well done, carefully building up to the climax: the tornado chasing car scene. And the special effects are surprisingly good, right up there with Twister! Wholly recommended to any disaster movie buff.",1176422400,8,735,4.661538461538462
2480842,5,B000E1OIBC,I've been of fan of John Schneider's since the first episode of the Dukes of Hazzard.  He is multi-talented and brings life to this story of tragedy in a small town.,1175644800,,165,4.32258064516129

8104045,2,B000E1OIBC,"Long before Justin Bieber, Canada had unleashed another teen celebrity on the world, Devon Sawa. He was better looking, more talented, and much less successful. While not as well known, during the mid-90s, putting him in any film almost guaranteed a bigger box office, and that was the case with Night of Twisters. This horrible, direct-to-video film, never should have made it to the U.S., but gained worldwide distribution because of it's star. Even twenty years later, the DVD is still considered a collectors item among collectors of teen idol memorabilia, and regularly sells on Amazon and eBay for upwards of $50. That being said, what makes this movie so awful, besides that it's an independent film made in Canada? Even for 1996, the special effects are laughable, this was Canada's response to Twister and not only don't the effects come close to comparison, but the story is just terrible. Obviously the story is going to center around the teen star, who sneaks out with friends to go meet girls. He's punished and has to stay home and watch his baby sister instead of going to the town event at the local high school. It's a boring night, until the town is hit by a series of tornadoes, forcing Sawa, to save the baby, save the girls, save his best friend, and then if there's time, go find his parents. The story is straight out of a kids movie, but the language and some of the devastation is not, so which is it? Is this some weird teen friendly family film or some scary disaster movie? The bottom line a lot of people love Devon Sawa, me included, that's why even today he's still getting work, but when it comes to this film, there is no real story, no real plot, it's as predictable as anything you will ever see, and the special effects make the tornado from the Wizard of Oz look more realistic. I can't believe that twenty years later the DVD costs more than the Godfather and they're still playing this thing on cable, but some things are just inexplicable.",1474243200,,1979,4.609065155807365
