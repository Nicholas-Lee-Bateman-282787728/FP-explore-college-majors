5361333,5,B009RJRI2I,"Classic TV Bloopers is great ! Just what it says. Enjoyed the stars a lot, like The fantastic Elizabeth Taylor from ""General Hospital"" in 1981,and the fabulous Mamie Van Doren in a rare clip from ""Burke's Law"" in 1964. She makes a funny reference to a trumpet player, and her fans know it was one of her ex-husbands she was talking about. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her stand on women's and gay rights.  A living legend and one of the last stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Some of the commercials make you go hmmmm...Fans of television will like this the most.",1437696000,,598,4.292035398230088

5361337,5,B009RJRI2I,Bloopers are usually funny and these are no exception. I laughed and laughed to see how stars are human and can make a word mistake which is quite funny to me. If you are displeased with any swear language you might not like the uncensored version. I was not offended in any way myself. It was very humorous to me an another friend who also enjoyed it as well. So many stars and clips from so many different shows really made this a plus and it was well put together.,1427673600,4,467,4.2
5361338,4,B009RJRI2I,The classic bloopers are always entertaining!!  :),1427241600,,50,6.142857142857143
5361339,1,B009RJRI2I,This video is very inappropriate. After the happy days bloopers almost everything goes down hill. I did not expect that uncensored men't naked people or the F word being used a lot. I thought it would be more wholesome since it was older shows. Even some commercial bloopers were bad. We did not even finish watching it and are returning it.,1426896000,2,341,4.60655737704918
5361340,4,B009RJRI2I,It was funny in parts and just ok in other parts. It was good to see older shows and some were very funny and then here were some dull moments. I still would recommend to people because of how funny some of it is.,1426118400,3,213,3.8636363636363638

5361344,4,B009RJRI2I,"A funny glimpse of behind-the-scenes antics, flubs and goofs from classic TV shows.  Nothing earthshatteringly new here, but it's all presented in an enjoyable program-length show that moves from show to show with lots of laughs.",1408147200,3,229,5.361111111111111
5361345,5,B009RJRI2I,"This blooper collection is one of the best I have seen; If you are a fan of the old classic comedies like Dick Van Dyke, Laverne and Shirley--you will love watching this! It is fun watching some of my favorite comedy actors mess up--they are human! If you need an escape and laughs, buy this!",1395273600,8,292,4.327272727272727
5361346,2,B009RJRI2I,This was a waste of money and time. The language and content of many were vulgar. I will not bother taking these to The Goodwill Store to donate. There were precious few clips that were actually funny and clean.,1395014400,5,211,4.435897435897436
5361347,3,B009RJRI2I,"T/V/ Bloopers aren;t new and ""Classic TV Bloopers Uncensored"" does just what it says it will. But just how long can one listen to actors orget lines or watch props fail to work or actors trip over a phone cord?

Anyone who grew up on the edited and perfectioon of filed stories may be fine with this; those acgors and audiences who are comfortable with live theatre realize that to break character is a mortal sin. Back in the 70's many people used to enjoy the ""Carol Burnet Show"" in order to watch Harvey Korman or Vickie Lawrence break inti laughter at the steadfast acting of tim Conway and Carol Burnet. If you liked that, then this may well bring you pleasure. or me I found it irritating thinking how I would tell my acting students that o break character was to steal monet from the audience and to betray the audience. This is called ""Breaking the fourth wall.""- that invisible wall between the stage and the audience tha the audiences don;t see but the actors must pretend is there. I've come to see how the really fine actors stay in character while their scence partner laughs or snots. On the ""Roseanne Show' we watched Laurie Metcalf and John gooidman continue to work in chbaracter as Rosie wouold snort and gigle until she eventually gave up. (Svenes between etcalf and Goodman were sibnsequently the best.

There were some series where outtakes were indeed funny because some acgors will push their fellow actors to break character. Irt rarely happened on ""Friends"" whereall six of them were seasoned theatre trained actors though I remember a scene when Joey enters Monica's apartment and, thinking beneath his bathrobe he is dressed for a party to which they are not invited they ask him to o-pen his robe, He does so and the script suggests that underneath it he is naked. He is notl of course, but he turns to the audience and shows them that he has taped a picture of Matthew Perrys face over her crotch. THEN they laugh.

Several of the shows on this DVD were live from time to time, such as ""I Love lucy"" where when something went wrong they had to keep gpoing. Lucy could go with anything and desi would try to improivise, a smile would break and bits of Spanish would sneak through. Think back to the ""Honeymooners"" which performed live every time. Saturday Night Live has bee n on a seven second selay for four deacdes. I was watching the night that Sinead O'Conner tore the picture o the pope in half. The film ""Network"" and the pilot of ""Studio 60"" delve into live television where we see that the only thing that can be done is to cut to VTR or commercial.

After a while missed lines are not enough. This DVD contains soime wonderful costume and set malfunctions and again, for some, it's a matter how measuring how an acgor handles it.

i can;t imagine anyone watching this DVD more than once. It's the sort that one person buys, and then donates to the library.

For those who have looked at the cover? Mary Tyler Moore never once breaks chgaracter nor does Penny Marhsall. Who would you hire?",1392681600,2,3026,4.553308823529412
5361348,1,B009RJRI2I,Was a MAJOR disappointment. Wasn't what I thought it would be at all. Thought it would be funny but it wasn't.,1384992000,2,110,4.285714285714286
5361349,5,B009RJRI2I,I always get a good laugh out of bloopers and I decided to see if I could just get bloopers and I am glad I bought it because I was laughing through most of it.  I think you will enjoy too if you like bloopers.,1377993600,4,210,3.6666666666666665

8543901,5,B009RJRI2I,"Well, we abhor massive use of F-word and such in movies today, but this naughty Documentary, if you dare call it that, sure demonstrates that hardly anything has changed, really.  People goof up and it blows up.  Nice to see people had fun behind the scenes.  My father used to laugh with me when Red Skelton referred to how the Censors cut what was said in the rehearsals.  Live TV was not boring.  TV audiences are still mostly dismissive Puritans in America.",1506211200,,461,4.573170731707317
