8349708,5,0990002101,A group of about 12 of us have watched Shawn's DVDs on both jealousy and forgiveness and we thoroughly enjoyed them.  Shawn uses scriptures to guide us through what happens when we harbor jealousy and do not deal with it; the same with her forgiveness study.  Shawn shares from her personal life trials with these topics so we know she truly understands and wants to help us understand.  The Lord has given her difficult topics to discuss and she does them with thoughtfulness and a straightforward attitude.  We are so glad that we participated in both of these studies and highly recommend them.  Be prepared to learn more about the Lord!,1379980800,,640,4.72972972972973
