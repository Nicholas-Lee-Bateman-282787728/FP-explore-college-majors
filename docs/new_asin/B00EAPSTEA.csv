8603332,1,B00EAPSTEA,"High Anxiety, 1977 film

A TWA Boeing 747 lands at an airport. You see the faces of some of the passengers. [Note the differences at an airport from today.] Dr. Richard A. Thorndyke leaves with his limo driver; he is the new head of the Asylum. His predecessor may have died from ""foul play"". This Institute is very lavish. The hospital staff seems odd. [Are these skits still funny?] Thorndyke has a fear of heights! High anxiety? There is a lavish dining room, like an expensive restaurant. Thorndyke asks about the plans of his predecessor. Who's in charge here? A pocket calculator gives the rate of recovery. Later he gets a welcome note. There is a noise from Nurse Diesel's room. [Is this funny?] Why is a patient being kept there at a rate of $12,000 a month? This patient dreams about werewolves and gets pains in his neck! [Just who needs treatment here?] Where are those flashes coming from? There is some unseemly behavior here.

""Mama, I am falling!"" Thorndyke visits the Violent Ward. He meets Arthur Brisbane, the Industrialist. Nurse Diesel talks to Dr. Wentworth; he is unhappy there. As he drives away his car radio plays full blast; will this cause a stroke? Thorndyke goes to San Francisco and finds his room was changed to a higher floor. ""What a view!"" [Those parodies won't mean much to people today.] Later he gets a surprise visitor. ""Close the drapes."" She is Victoria Brisbane. She lights her cigarette. [Remember unrestricted smoking?] Thorndyke speaks to the meeting. A man talks on a pay telephone. [Remember them?] Will he answer that question? What about toilet training? [Is this still funny?] Later Thorndyke meets Victoria at dinner. Thorndyke sings! [This is not the high spot of this movie.] He does not have a wireless microphone. He learns that patient is not the real Arthur Brisbane!

Nurse Diesel has a plan to prevent Thorndyke from going to the police. ""What does this mean?"" [It means this is not a great movie.] Thorndyke must avoid the police now. He visits the Golden Gate Park at the ""North by Northwest"" corner. The birds chase him to a storage shed! Next he goes to a clothes cleaner. Victoria's clothes match her car (or vice-versa). [Recognize that design?] Does that photograph contain a clue? Can Brophy blow up that negative? Yes. ""Very good work."" Can they suppress that photo? A pager summons Frazier for his next assignment. ""Life is good."" Thorndyke makes a telephone, That man is there to attack him. There is another skit at the airport. [Is this funny? No.] Dick and Vicky return to the Institute. Brophy is in the North Wing and tells them of the plan for murder. They climb the stairway to rescue Arthur Brisbane. Can anything go wrong? [Yes, this movie continues.] Thorndyke is cured by a few words from the professor. Brisbane is rescued, there will be a marriage.

The writers of this script copied parts from old Alfred Hitchcock movies. A copy is not as good as the original unless the writer has the skills to make it better. Was this meant as a comic parody? Or of psychiatry or mental illness or Hitchcock movies? I think it doesn't hit its target. ""Foul Play"" was based on ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and is a better movie (even with its funny parts). That ""Oh Dennis"" phrase is an echo of Jack Benny. [Remember him? Not if you are under forty, unless you've seen old shows.] That ""tin teeth"" character echoes a villain in a ""James Bond"" movie of that year.
[I found ""Wrongfully Accused"" a funnier movie. Is it me or time?]",1425081600,,3497,4.68130081300813

HIGH ANXIETY, my all-time favorite Mel Brooks farce, has him starring as the newly-appointed head of the ""Psychoneurotic Institute For the Very, Very Nervous.""

In this ""wrongly-accused man"" parody, Brooks and a cast of comedy superstars spoof a number of Hitchcock films in great style. Mel even croons the title song, &aacute; la Frank Sinatra.

One of the best comedies ever! (Watch for director Barry Levinson's hilarious cameo as a demented bellhop.)

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.
