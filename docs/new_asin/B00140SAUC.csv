8253837,1,B00140SAUC,"I deceided to see what the other side of the Darwin arguement was thinking, and just as I suspected. Nothing! The other side of Darwin really has nothing to say,other than the same old, tired,  regressive arguement that just falls back on itself and answers nothing. We don't know how the Universe came to exist and we may never know. Dr. Kraus has a better grip on this than I do. We are learning everyday more and more about the origin of life. Men like Charles Darwin were closer on the heels of the truth than belief in the strange idea that it all came about by some Sky God waveing a magic wand. Only a fool would accept such nonsense, but sadly there are millions of them. Lets just hope that we unravel this mystery before all of the Christers, Jews, Islamics, Born agains, and Mormon morons kill us all.
