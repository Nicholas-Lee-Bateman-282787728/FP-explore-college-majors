8561983,3,B00B361IQK,"The first battle between Austin and The Rock was ok, but it spent too much time outside the ring fighting and using foreign objects and not enough time on actual wrestling.  The Brawl for all was short and killed Bart Gun's career because he was supposed to be the tough guy.  Nothing special about Undertaker vs Big Boss Man, it was the worst performance of the dvd.  Xpac vs Shane was ok.  The Hardcore Title match was good.  The Intercontinental match was a waste of time, due to a double count out.  The rest of the segments and matches are forgettable.",1491868800,,557,4.465346534653466

YOU CAN BUY THIS IF YOU REALLY DON'T CARE IF ALL LOGO'S THAT SAY WWF IS BLURED AND WHEN EVER ANYONE SAYS WWF IT GETS BEEPED.

8561986,3,B00B361IQK,"This is my second review on Wrestlemania 15. My first review was on the original DVD and this one is on the re-released version released in 2013. To see my sidenotes on this version, check out the bottom of this review

The final Wrestlemania of the 1990s emanated from the First Union Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 28th, 1999

1.) Triple Threat WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Al Snow vs Hardcore Holly vs Billy Gunn (c)

You had of the Attitude Era's fan favorites....and Hardcore Holly open the show, beating each other senseless with numerous weapons for a chance to be Hardcore Champion. Doesn't get much better than that for a Wrestlemania opener, does it? Hardcore Holly pins Al Snow after a Fame Asser from Billy Gunn to get the win. Overall a fun and exciting match opener to warm the fans up and prepare them for the night

2.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: D'Lo Brown w/Ivory and Test vs Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett (c) w/Debra

This was pretty much a last minute filler match that happened after D'Lo and Test won a Battle Royal. Although there was no big basis behind this match it was decent for it's time, which was short. Jeff and Owen retain with Jarrett pinning D'Lo while Test was on the outside arguing with Debra and Ivory. Sad to say, this was Owen's last Wrestlemania as he was living in his last says right before the tragedy that'd happen just a couple months later.

3.) Brawl For All: Bart Gunn vs Butterbean

Idk what possessed Vince McMahon to do the Brawl For All to start with. Many people never seemed too invested in these boxing matches...but Vince was. There's a pre-match video as Gunns trainers predict he will beat Butterbean in the first, and second and the like. Gorilla Monsoon is then introduced as a judge, making his final Mania apperance. The fight beginsand its over. Butterbean wins by knockout at 0:35. I think the WWF learned there lesson here as this was the last Brawl For All match to happen. Brawl For All is still extincted and Bart Gunn is still knocked out by Butterbean

__________________________________

4.) Big Show vs Mankind - Winner Referees the Stone Cold vs The Rock Main Event

The reason for this match happening was stupid in every way. Two people fighting to be named special referee in the main event?? Because it's such an honor, right? A slow-short back and forth match that ends with Mankind getting a DQ victory after Big Show Chokeslammed Mankind through 2 steel chairs. A pissed off Vince McMahon comes out and insults Big Show for ruining the plan that was supposed to benefit him (McMahon) in the main event. Vince slaps Show and Show knocks out Vince. Horrible match with a mediocre storyline. But then again, Vince Russo was writing the stories at the time so it's no shock as to why it was mediocre

5.) Four Corners Elimination WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Road Dogg (c) vs Val Venis vs Ken Shamrock vs Goldust w/The Blue Meanie and Ryan Shamrock

Not too much of a bad match. A nice way to get some of the midcarders a spot on the Wrestlemania card but man oh man is Ryan Shamrock a sight for sore eyes! All 4 men were grapplers so there's a lot of decent grappling action going on throughout the match. Apparently, Jerry Lawler thinks Blue Meanie is an idiot, as we hilariously hear him call him dozens of times throughout the match. Road Dogg and Goldust are the final two in the match. Ryan accidentally distracts Goldust, which allows Road Dogg to hit Goldust with a unique move for the win to retain the title. After the match, Goldust severely scolds poor Ryan Shamrock

6.) Kane vs Triple H

As Kane made his way to the ring, the San Diego chicken mascot attacked Kane but failed. The person under the costume turned out to be Pete Rose who was trying to get some revenge for the Tombstone he suffered from Kane at the previous year's Wrestlemania. Unfortunately for Pete, he got Tombstoned again. On to the match! Kane and HHH had, had better matches prior to Mania and this was one of the worst. Things started out at a normal pace but mid-way though it slowed down became painful to watch. Philly almost fell asleep. Thankfully we had another Russo swerve at the end to make things seem semi-worthwhile. Must be seen to be believed.

Backstage, Vince McMahon tells Kevin Kelly that since there's no special referee for the main event, he'll be the referee! Jerry Lawler is ecstatic about this news

7.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Sable (c) vs Tori

This match was just horrible. In fact, it'd probably explain why there weren't many diva matches at Wrestlemania afterwards. Tori was wearing some hideous bodysuit that looked like Giant Gonzalez and Tony the Tiger got mixed together. Sloppy match. Nicole Bass makes her WWF debut and helps Sable win the match. Next!

__________________________________

8.) WWF European Championship Match: Shane McMahon (c) w/Test vs X-Pac

This match featured a nice display of athleticism. Shane McMahon was just beginning his in-ring WWF career and he surprisingly impressed in the ring. Just as X-Pac looked to have the match won, part 2 of Vince Russo's swerves came in when Triple H came to the ring and turned on X-Pac with a Pedigree and Shane pinned X-Pac to retain the title. All while Chyna distracted the referee. Shane, Test, Triple H, and Chyna all attack X-Pac following the match. The New Age Outlaws try to jump in and save X-Pac but they get beat down too. Kane comes back out and goes right after Triple H and Chyna, chasing them to the back

__________________________________

9.) Hell In A Cell Match: Big Bossman vs The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer

Another disaster of a match. The build-up leading to this match was astonishing but unfortunately the match itself did not deliver. Both Bossman and Undertaker were heel in this match but Undertaker still got cheered from fans, most likely due to the respect they had for him. The match moved way too slow and this match was filled with nothing but a barrage of punches and kicks. Nothing else. Talk about a snoozefest. Taker puts Bossman away in the end with a Tombstone to go 8-0 at Wrestlemania. This was just as bad as Undertaker's match with Giant Gonzalez at Wrestlemania 9. What happened after the match is something that's still etched in my mind to this day. Following the bout, Undertaker with the assistance of The Brood and Paul Bearer, hung Big Bossman from the cell. Watching that as a kid, sent chills down my spine and literally scared the heck out of me. I was scared to go to bed that night. Horrendous match with a jaw dropping post-match scene

10.) WWF Championship Match: The Rock (c) vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

This was the first of the 3 Stone Cold vs The Rock matches to happen at Wrestlemania and it was probably the least exciting of the 3. Now I'm not saying this match isn't good but if you compare it to their other 2 matches, it can't compete. Before the match, Commissioner Michaels came out and told Vince McMahon he would not be the special referee (Earl Hebner was) and ordered that no members of The Corporation interfere in the match. J.R. also thankfully replaced Michael Cole on commentary to call the main event. The match was great in all aspects and was probably the best one of the night. Stone Cold and The Rock had a great chemistry with each other and it really showed in this match, making it exciting to watch along with King and J.R's commentary. Vince comes to the ring to try and prevent Stone Cold from winning but Mankind returns to the arena and lays Vince out. Through it all, Stone Cold manages to hit the Stunner on The Rock to win 3rd WWF Championship and Vince's face was priceless

Overall: This wasn't exactly the best Wrestlemania to end the 1990s. It was mostly filled with boring or mediocre matches with only 2 or 3 really being worth the watch. It was a fine example of having great build-up but not being able to deliver with matches on the PPV.

Sidenotes: This is the re-released Walmart version that was released in stores in March of 2013 and here are a few notes about the re-released version

- The WWF logo is not blurred and WWF is not censored out when commentators or announcers say the name

- This is a PG re-released version, meaning many ""violent"" scenes have been edited out. The most notable one being the post-match hanging at the conclusion of the Bossman vs Undertaker Hell In A Cell match. For some reason they also edited out the pre-match package video leading up to the match

- There a few edited jumpy cutscenes in here which is quite a bother at times

- The disc is a blank disc with no artwork

- There are NO extras on the DVD

Overall, I'd sacrifice the few extra dollars and get the original version released in 1999 so that way you get the entire PPV with no stupid PG edits",1395964800,,9224,4.750156543519099
8561987,5,B00B361IQK,One hell of a pay-per-view from the Attitude Era. Great way to end the show with Undertaker vs. Big Boss Man and The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Great way to start the show with Three-way for the Hardcore Championship. Great show overall with lots of action in between and good job of restoring the WWF logo.,1366416000,,314,4.431034482758621
8561988,2,B00B361IQK,"A couple of notes here in that all of the previous Mania releases were direct copies taken from the WrestleMania Anthology released back in 2005 when WWE lost the rights to their initials ""W.W.F."" & the ""Attitude Era"" logo but this disc isn't from that set as all the references to WWF & the logo are restored here but there are some edits throughout the presentation such as competitors choking each other, different camera angles in different spots, and the infamous scene at the end of the Hell In A Cell match removed so this presentation is no different than when a movie is edited down for television.

The hardcore city of Philadelphia hosted the 15th edition of WrestleMania in what was nicknamed ""The Ragin' Climax"".  Celebrities involved with the show included Chuck Wepner, Kevin Rooney, Vinny Pazienza, and Boyz II Men singing ""America The Beautiful.""  This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like Michael Cole, Teddy Long as a referee, Al Snow, Debra McMichael, Test, Big Show, Val Venis, Edge & Christian in a cameo appearance, and Shane McMahon.

Steve Austin walked into his second Mania main event in what would eventually be the first of a trilogy of WrestleMania matches against WWE Champion The Rock to regain the title he was screwed out of months earlier in a No Disqualification Match that saw both men brawling in & out of the ring with people from Mr. McMahon to the special guest referee making their presence known while it should be noted that Jim Ross returned to commentary for this match.  European Champion Shane McMahon defended his title against X-Pac in a match that surpassed expectations due to Shane's athletic ability while also having Shane's friends in the Mean Street Posse at ringside & Test in his corner before we got a shock that nobody expected.  Other matches Undertaker vs. Big Boss Man in a Hell In A Cell match that was so disappointing to the point where WWE never shows highlights of this match when showing the history of the Cell & didn't include it in the Hell In A Cell anthology DVD, Womens Champion Sable vs. Tori, Triple H vs. Kane, Intercontinental Champion Road Dogg vs. Ken Shamrock vs. Val Venis vs. Goldust, Mankind vs. Big Show to determine who would be the referee in the main event, Butterbean vs. Bart Gunn in a Brawl For All match, Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett vs. D'Lo Brown & Test, and the first Hardcore Championship title defense in Mania history with Champion Billy Gunn vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Al Snow.

This WrestleMania was really only a two match show in the World & European Championship matches as most of the action just wasn't very good or had booking that really didn't make any sense (D'Lo Brown & Test teaming together when they had no history before or after this event?  Billy Gunn & Road Dogg switching title matches a week before the show killing the storylines for the two matches?) & all of this isn't even including the edits that were made for this DVD edition of the event.  In the end, you can get the Austin/Rock match on various DVD sets while get the Shane/X-Pac match online elsewhere but the rest of the card isn't anything memorable so this is a Mania you can skip as it was very disappointing.",1364774400,,3251,4.689473684210526
8561989,3,B00B361IQK,"This particular dvd of Wrestlemania XV is an improvement in comparison to XIV. While I am very appreciative of the WWE finally restoring all the logos instead of the blurring that occurred in ALL past Wrestlemania Anthology releases. Like the other reviewer stated, one of the things I found the most annoying was the editing of certain segments from the event such as my most vivid memory of this event, the hanging of the Big Bossman from the top of the Hell in the Cell. I was like, ""what in the world happened to the hanging"" and the very mention of it was removed while they cut directly to the lame Rage Party. While other than the editing of the Bossman/Undertaker match, most of the slight editing is barely noticeable.

If the WWE is going to re-release dvds of its past events, they really need to leave them be or place a label and/or disclaimer that the event has been edited for content.",1364428800,2,900,4.521472392638037
8561990,1,B00B361IQK,"Unlike the other 14 DVDs released along with it, the new Wrestlemania XV is not the same DVD from the 2005 Wrestlemania Anthology, though it does have the same menu style and likewise lacks disc art or extras. The WWF logo is not blurred, Tori has her original theme, ""WWF"" is spoken and there are no dubbed Howard Finkel announcements. However, it has been edited for violent content. Total running time for the 2005 release of WM XV is 2:46:23, but the total running time for this 2013 release of WM XV is 2:39:03. Notably, the video package and entire postmatch segment were edited from Boss Man/Undertaker, and they also spots where Boss Man choked Taker and Austin choked The Rock.

Differences that I found (time based on more complete 2005 timecode):
16:09: 2013 restores a 5 second shot of Holly walking away with the belt cut from 2005

18:23: 2013 extends the bickering of Test and D'Lo when 2005 dissolves to a shot of the audience. 2013 cuts to the audience after one second of bickering, a little before the point of the dissolve in 2005.

48:51: 2013 restores a half second shot of an audience member giving the finger.

50:05: 2013 restores a half second of dead frame as Road Dogg ducks before a cut to the crowd.

1:25:02: 2013 cuts a 10 second shot of Big Pun in the crowd.

1:26:58-1:27:08: Alternate footage. The lead in on both cuts is Tori walking to the ring. 2005 cuts to 5 seconds of video package from Raw, 2013 cuts to Tori attempting to slide into the ring and getting an axe handle from Sable. At 1:27:06 2005 and 2013 are in sync again, with 2005 not showing the axe handle at all and 2013 showing none of the video package.

1:31:09-1:31:18: Alternate angles. 2013 shows this attempt at a Sable Bomb in a single close profile shot. 2005 cuts to a wider profile shot and then to a shot from behind Sable.

1:33:13: 2013 restores an extra 1 second of Lawler before the X-Pac/Shane match graphic, and the graphic runs about 5 seconds longer as well. It's interesting because in 2005 it flashes to the DX promo, while in 2013 in dissolves to the promo, so in 2005 you can like see everyone with their eyes down, which you don't notice in 2013 because of the dissolve. By the time the dissolve finishes everyone's eyes are up.

1:48:02-1:50:23: 2013 removes the Undertaker video package in its entirety, though it does tack on a 3 second shot of the M&M blimp in its place.

1:58:29-1:58:50: 2013 removes Boss Man choking Undertaker, replacing 18 seconds of violence with 3 seconds of Paul Bearer B roll.

2:05:11-2:08:36: 2013 completely removes the hanging of Boss Man, cutting right to the Rage Party.

2:08:38: 2013 is reversed here for some reason, and notice whatever kinda ghosting or overlay is goingon with the WWF logo.

2:09:19: 2013 cuts 30 seconds of the Rage party vignette here.

2:09:49: 2013 cuts a 4 second shot from the Rage party.

2:25:35-2:25:50: 2013 cuts Austin choking Rock, replacing it with a three second crowd shot.

2:45:27: 2013 completely cuts Undertaker/Boss Man from music video, and oddly also the Shawn/Vince stuff afterward, picking up with the shot of The Rock's entrance.

Some title graphics were not altered for 2005 (Hardcore, Brawl for All), but the ones that were are restored on 2013.

I'm really shocked at some of these edits. We're gonna have to somehow let WWE know that these alterations are not cool. Particularly the two choking shots but really all of it. These events should be uncut. I have to give it one star because they didn't make any kind of mention of the editing.",1362873600,31,3552,4.637958532695375
