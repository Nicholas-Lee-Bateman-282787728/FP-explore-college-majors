8372172,4,B002KQHVUO,"First, a word about the region coding. It's from Europe, and it's Region 2, meaning it won't play in the majority of DVD players in North America. Luckily, the Xbox 360 did play it, and I didn't get burned like I thought. Just a heads-up for all consumers. Now onto the documentary. If you already know about August 1st 2008, and what happened up there on K2 , you know the story. Great, and I mean great footage of the ascent, all camps, the Shoulder, the bottleneck...it's all here in stunning hi-def. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because after following this story for years, most of what I saw, had already seen the light of day at one time or another. Most of it on YouTube or  Nightline. I was hoping for far more pooled footage from the various expeditions, and their photographs as well. More interviews with other climbers would have been nice, maybe Marco Confortola or Pemba Gayjle, but at least Wilco van Rooijen was there to tell his story a little bit . The footage of Cas & Wilco at base camp, being treated for severe frostbite , and only then learning of the fate of many climbers is errie .Wish it was longer , wish there was far more content , but there aren't very many vids on K2 , and until there's a movie made about those three days , it'll do .
Speaking of which, there is a film about to premiere at Sundance this year called ""The Summit"". It combines this doc and some truly amazing re-creations of the critical moments, and it looks as though I'm not the only one who feels this story is big-screen worthy. Cannot wait to see it here on Amazon.",1352764800,3,1577,4.30976430976431
