I bought the version that has 3 discs; 2 CDs and a DVD. The video is good, not great, and certainly not ""filmed with a camera-phone"". Though it does have a little too much ""arty-farty"" visuals for my taste. I've never been a fan of what I call stutter-step video (where it looks like a strobe is on the band) and would rather have straight-up video. Maybe that's what some others are critizing as well, but, to me, that's a small complaint. The audio, on the other hand, whether stereo or 5.1, is AWSOME.

The band is great (the singer from Quiet Riot AND one of Santana's singers from the 70s do background vocals on some songs!!!) and Glenn's voice is as powerful as ever. And, as others mention, the Chili Peppers's drummer, Chad Smith, is outstanding!!!

The only thing is, never having been a big Trapeze fan, I could have done with more Hughes solo songs and less Trapeze.

And, from reading the other reviews, it seems that another major complaint is that it is filmed in a really small place and everyone's sitting on rugs on the floor. But heck......it's an L.A. FAN CLUB show!!!! It's supposed to be intimate!!! While I agree it's not the best place to film a DVD, it's still good and I would love to have been there!!!

Overall, while I agree it could have been better, I really like it and would recommend it to ANY fan of Glenn Hughes. If it was cheaper I'd say don't believe the naysayers and check it out for yourself, but it is pretty pricey in these days of $12-15 DVDs!!",1174262400,,1689,4.470779220779221
8032734,2,B0002V7TIS,"First of all, let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Glenn Hughes fan.  I've been following his career since the Trapeze days and I think he is one of the best and most soulful vocalist around.  I have all his discs and I will continue to buy his discs because he's something special.  Now, the problem with the DVD.  First of all, I don't like the filters that were used in the production of the video.  Secondly, there is a very clear disconnect between the music and the video.  It just doesn't gel!  Too much technological meddling.  And clearly there are many times where you hear Glenn's voice but he is not singing at the mike.  What does this mean?  Well, in my opinion , it appears that he's overdubbed quite a bit of the vocals, if not all of them.  This is a live concert for crying out loud.  I want to see a performance with the warts and all, otherwise I'll listen to the studio CD.  Glenn Hughes is amazing but this DVD was extremely disappointing to me.  Not to mention that the individual tracks are not even indexed.  Hopefully next time we will see a real performance!",1107302400,2,1088,4.29064039408867
8032735,3,B0002V7TIS,"I bought this as an import along with the 2CD set and let me tell you, I should have passed on the whole thing.  Glenn has had a long career with lots of songs to choose from.  Why these?  Most didn't rock and were all just so unnecessarily long and boring.  I own most if not all of his recordings and when trying to order this, I could not be supplied with the song list.  Bad sign.  When I received it, I just couldn't believe the songs omitted and what ended up as the list.  The studio was setup as some throwback velvet walled 70's club and the different camera speeds and angles just didn't work.  I thought this was going to be a concert film.  It is just Glenn and his band in front of some people who are just laid back and watching.  Just not very exciting and if this was done and released, what was edited out?  This fan sold both the dvd and the CDs.  Save your money and find a bootleg of him in actual concert, not this.  The dvd and CD packages were nicely done though by the people at Frontiers records.  The  packaging brought up the rating on this.  If you don't own ""Burning Japan Live"", pick that up instead.",1100217600,4,1130,4.138248847926267
8032736,3,B0002V7TIS,"Glenn Hughes makes fantastic music. However, he makes inferior DVD's. The video on this is incredibly poor. It looks like it was filmed using a video phone. The music is great but the poor quality of picture spoils the show. I am really surprized that this was released with poor video.

I suggest buying the CD instead.

This could have been a great concert DVD....",1099699200,5,366,4.615384615384615
8032737,1,B0002V7TIS,"Warning!!!....Stay away from this DVD!!!

As a longtime Glenn Hughes fan I was heartbroken by the quality of this DVD. The performance is great but the quality of the video was possibly inferior that of some webcasts. The video also seems to have been filmed with a time delay effect making glenn's vocals and the also the drummer's playing out of time with what we are seeing on the screen.

During darker moments we are subjected to a unacceptable amount of pixelation all over the image.

Glenn Hughes as an artist should never have permitted such a shoddy (Grab The Money And Run) release to have ever hit the shelves.

Shame On Him!!",1099526400,7,638,4.619469026548672
