7809961,3,630111549X,"The movie starts off a husband, wife, and kid in the home at Christmas time. The husband gets a phone call from his employee and the husband fires him ""pretty sad to fire someone around that time"". The next thing you know they get a knock on the door and the husband open it. I man in a wolf mask and shotgun kills the husband and wife. The little kid is the only one left but gets spared. Then it fast forward to the kid being in college at stuff..you know living life. He starts having bad dreams about the killer and just can't get sleep. Everyday he keeps seeing this man outside just staring at him..is this just a illusion, no body else sees him. He thinks he's going crazy until he finds a dead deer in his tub, then he knows this man has came back to finish what he started.

I can't tell much without giving the little great parts in the film since theirs so few on them. It plays out like a TV mystery movie, which you know are slow with little action. But when the killer revealed themselves it shocked me. To bad you had to go through these endless guessing game to find it out. The movies good for a boring rainy day..to bad it's not on DVD.",1383782400,,1154,4.128888888888889
