2704368,5,B000LC4CUG,"This is an older film, but does not appear dated.  I find it impossible not to think of Vladimir Megre's successful Anastasia series of books watching this film, and wonder if in some way it may have been an inspiration for him.",1367107200,,228,4.428571428571429
2704369,5,B000LC4CUG,"Exellent copy, I particularly appreciated the comments which gave interesting psychological hinsight to the various situations: The Sorcire is perhaps the best film of Marina Vlady: I suggest you to release on DVD another exeptional film with Marina Vlady that has not yet been released by any company: The wicked go to hell (Les salauds vont a l'enfer).",1224979200,5,354,5.120689655172414
2704370,5,B000LC4CUG,"i understand you want to know my opinion about the product,the movie,well it came on time,very good quality of the dvd and i really enjoyed it because i have seen it many years ago,when i was a child",1207785600,,199,4.2631578947368425
2704371,5,B000LC4CUG,"This is one of my favourite movies of all time. First seen as a teenager in the fifties and happily rediscovered as a pensioner. Marina Vlady is beautiful in a way that none of her contemporary screen sirens could match. Although the title conjurs up a negative image of her as a sorceress, the ""white magic"" that she performs is not used for evil purposes and is a minor part of a film that depicts a beautiful, but doomed, love affair. In common with many European movies, the settings are creative and realistic. The music, particularly Ina's theme, which she sings at one pont, is mezmerizing. Fifty years after seeing the movie but twice, I would still hum the tune to myself. I am a born romantic, and cannot watch this picture with dry eyes. Marina is more angel than witch.",1193788800,10,781,4.546099290780142
2704372,5,B000LC4CUG,"...and not your ordinary sorceress either.  Ina is pure as driven snow, innocent as the faun she befriends.  The young French engineer who falls in love with her cites her ""witchcraft, innocence and purity.""  But the jacket notes are misleading, for she is not an ""ordinary girl.""  She really is a witch and proves it over and over.  And she is afraid to ever set foot in a church.

But it is not her love of the engineer that does her in, the archetypal matching of Venus and Vulcan, and it's not the love triangle the engineer inadvertently sets up or the spirits he dynamites out of the rock or even the corporate greed of the landlord.  It's you and I, my friend, ordinary folk, who insist that this kind of beauty and power are not allowed among us.  It is a conclusion which troubles me greatly, but one I know in my heart to be true because of less severe events that have befallen me.  So I assure you, though parts of this movie may seem strange and incongruous, something rings true about it.",1174089600,4,1002,4.372972972972973

8161328,4,B000LC4CUG,"To be clear, the movie itself is not a four-star movie. But I bought it for Marina Vlady and was delighted to see this wonderful young woman, who had been a ""fire of my [youthful] loins"" (V. N. Nabokov) - sadly only on screen - exude her powerfully subdued sexual aura once again. The DVD had no technical flaws, something previous reviewers had warned against; must have been a different batch.",1472169600,,395,4.577464788732394
8161329,5,B000LC4CUG,OK!Thank you!,1454198400,,13,6.0
8161330,1,B000LC4CUG,Great film but TWO DVD's I bought  from  Amazon froze in 84th minute and the last chapter 10 is completely not accessible on any of my multiple dvd players. This is a defective DVD batch that Amazon should NOT be selling. Super disappointing. Calls to the manufacturer went unanswered. ZERO STARS when you can't view the whole film.,1423267200,,332,4.706896551724138
8161331,5,B000LC4CUG,"This is a French classic which has been entirely filmed in rural Sweden. This is probably Marina Vlady's best role (""Enough Rope"" is my other Vlady favorite based on ""The Blunderer"" by Patricia Highsmith).
In ""La sorcire"" Vlady plays a young woman who lives in the woods and is considered being a witch by the village residents. Ronet is an engineer working close-by on a project. Another (rich) woman is interested in him. But he has only eyes for Marina Vlady.

Maurice Ronet was always a great actor, but he was never better than in ""Plein soleil"" (Purple Noon) based on Highsmith's first of the 5 Ripley novels, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"".",1422144000,,642,4.732142857142857
8161332,1,B000LC4CUG,"The movie is wonderful!  Unfortunately, there seems to be a batch of bad DVDs in the system.  I have had 2 of these in a row with the same problem.  In Chapter 9, about 1 hour, 24 minutes, and 03 seconds into the movie, it freezes.  Chapter 10 is not playable. I have tried this disc on 3 different players with precisely the same result.  I notice other comments have recently listed a similar experience with their discs, as well.  The movie itself is wonderful, so I hope the apparent issues with the current batch of discs can be resolved.",1397692800,,543,4.38
8161333,1,B000LC4CUG,"It seems that the current batch of La Sorciere DVDs is defective. In October 2013, I asked our local library to purchase the DVD. We received our copy from Amazon in November. I was the first person to get it from the library. The DVD froze towards the end of the movie in chapter 9. The last chapter, chapter 10, is not playable. The library returned the copy and received a new copy in December. When the new copy was tested, exactly the same flaw was observed, which suggests a manufacturing defect. I hope that Amazon removes this batch of La Sorciere from its shelves and replaces it with good copies because La Sorciere is a very interesting movie.",1387756800,3,654,4.504201680672269
8161334,1,B000LC4CUG,"SUBTITLES OFTEN SMEAR......THIS CREATES TRAILS ACROSS THE IMAGES........GHOSTS.........THIS TITLE NEEDS TO BE RELEASED WHERE THIS PROBLEM IS CORRECTED.....ALSO, MY COPY FROZE WITH ABOUT FIVE MINUTES REMAINING......I PLAYED IT ON TWO DIFFERENT MACHINES AND THE SAME THINGS OCCURED..........A CHEAP DVD-R.",1376784000,3,303,6.794871794871795
