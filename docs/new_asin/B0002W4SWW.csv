2128139,5,B0002W4SWW,"FINALLY!  This is ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" without the hatred and anger.  Sure the family rags on each other a bit, but you can still feel the respect and love... sadly missing in most ""Raymond"" episodes.  And it was a darn funny show.  Hurry up with all the rest of the seasons!",1097280000,4,280,4.431372549019608
2128140,4,B0002W4SWW,"I liked this show, but the family values issues did get on my nerves a lot, and how Jill (the wife) would always jump down Tim's back about the littlest things - it seemed.

The neighbor, Wilson, was pretty cool, always with some wise information for Tim and the others.  And this first season, possibly the next one too, had Pamela Anderson in it as the Tool Time girl.  Here's a description of the episodes on this set:

""Pilot"" - Tim wrecks the dishwasher, while trying to give it more power;  Jill gets a job interview

""Mow Better Blues"" - Mark breaks a tool of Tim's, which Jill was told to stay away from

""Off Sides"" - Tim hires a magician as a babysitter

""Satellite on a Hot Tim's Roof"" - Tim installs a satellite dish;  one of Jill's teachers visits

""Wild Kingdom"" - Tim hears some weird noises in the basement

""Adventures in Fine Dining"" - Tim bets Jill that he can teach their kids some table manners

""Nothing More Than Feelings"" - Tim tells his Tool Time audience that his wife drove with the oil light on;  the other guys say that their wives don't respect their tools

""Flying Sauces"" - The K & B Construction guys show how to make hot gourmet meals while on the job, on Tool Time;  Brad and Randy tell Mark that Brad, Randy, and their parents are aliens

""Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble"" - Tim puts another sink in their bathroom

""Reach Out and Teach Someone"" - Tim does a Tool Time episode for women to teach plumbing;  Brad worries that he's going to do bad on a test at school

""Look Who's Not Talking"" - At a presentation for the Library Association:  Jill gets stage fright

""Yule Better Watch Out"" - Tim competes in a neighborhood Christmas light competition;  Brad and Randy tell Mark that Santa Claus is dead

""Up Your Alley"" - Tim and Jill go bowling;  the kids get in trouble at a local arcade

""For Whom the Belch Tolls"" - Jill doesn't want an old college friend of Tim's to stay with them

""Forever Jung"" - Karen comes to visit;  Jill teaches Brad to dance

""Jill's Birthday"" - Tim buys Jill a lifetime membership to a health club;  after wasting all their money, Brad and Randy put together a scheme to get Mark's money

""What About Bob?"" - Tim competes against Bob Vila in a trivia game;  Randy pulls a prank on a nerd at school

""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" - Tim's boss has Tim and Jill go camping to promote some new camping gear.  The problem is that they had a romantic weekend planned instead

""Unchained Malady"" - Tim throws away a chain letter;  Randy gets dared to do a trick on his bike

""Birds of a Feather Flock to Taylor"" - Jill tells Tim that he's a bad listener (happens to me all the time);  Brad and Randy try to get Mark to eat a worm

""A Battle of Wheels"" - Tim lets Al host Tool Time;  Tim accidently breaks some of Jill's pottery

""Luck Be a Taylor Tonight"" - Jill's sister and Al ruin Tim's poker night

""Al's Fair in Love and War"" - Tim wants to read Jill's old diary;  Al tries to ask a girl out

""Stereo-Typical"" - Tim and Jill argue over stereo volume

So buy this set, my favorite segments were always the Tool Time scenes of the episodes.  There should be an option of the DVDs to view only the Tool Time scenes, oh well.",1097280000,60,3183,4.27563025210084
2128141,5,B0002W4SWW,"I too live in the U.K. and are an avid Home Improvement fan, I watch it every day.  I just love the way it is just so true!  I can certainly identify with wanting to make things bigger and better.  It is also the only television show to have made me laugh out loud until it hurts.  I am looking forward to seeing the early episodes again, although they still seem so fresh.  I have pre ordered my copy, although region 1, as the dvd player I have (pacific 1002w from Asda for 35.00 quid) is multiregion and can even play RCE disks without problem.  I hope that the following series are released soon, because I cant wait to get More Power!",1096156800,18,639,4.19672131147541

2128143,5,B0002W4SWW,"Tim Allen, Pat Richardson and the Kids, made me smile and cry, they are wonderful and Home Improvement can not be forgotten.

I can not stop watching at this fabulous TV series.",1094169600,4,177,4.53125
2128144,5,B0002W4SWW,"It's about time is all I have to say. About time one of the best shows in TV history becomes available to buy. I've been a long time fan of the show. To get an e-mail from amazon anouncing it's arival has certainly made my day. ""What are we looking for?"" MORE POWER!",1093910400,8,266,4.037735849056604
2128145,5,B0002W4SWW,"I've only recently started to watch Home Improvement in syndication for the first time, and as soon as I got into it it has become one of my favourite sitcoms. The humoar is very original and the concept was very bright and fresh when it came along on ABC in 1991.

It wasn't just that that made it one of the most popular shows of the 90's, it was also the strengh of the characters. Tim Allen's portrayel of accident proned chauvanistic tool man Tim Taylor helps make the show along with his sidekick Al, wife Jill and three kids Brad, Randy and Mark.

This show also provided more realism than a lot of other shows of its kind, for example the relationship between the boys and their regular fighting seems a lot more true to life than other shows that often represent people as constantly loving and everything always patched up by the end of the show. Home Improvement still has many tender moments that are always well acted.

As well as the 24 episodes on this DVD set, you also get a gag reels of jokes from the show and a commentary by the creators. It's good to see that a lot of these sets now have extras and that the companies are going to the trouble of adding nice touches to the tv shows we know and love.

So overall, this set is one that you should definetly add to your collection, whether you want to re-discover the classic first season once again or watch this show for the first time and introduce it to your family who may not have been around then; either way you are very unlikely to be diassapointed! ""I don't think so Tim!""

Highly recommended!",1092787200,41,1572,4.351535836177474

2128172,5,B0002W4SWW,"My husband and I really enjoy this show!!  It is funnier, in our opinion, than most of the ""comedy"" currently on TV, and reminds us of when our three boys were growing up. The characters are likable and the overall tone of the show is positive.  The dialogue is educational at times, as when Wilson shares some insight with Tim, and even the ""suggestive"" dialogue is not in bad taste. Plenty of silliness but also affirms marriage and family.  I would like to see current shows done this well, but sadly that is quite rare.",1477872000,,523,4.484210526315789
2128173,5,B0002W4SWW,Love this show........I grew up on it and it is still just as good. A family show for everyone. I grew up with 6 brothers so finding a show we all enjoyed was hard. Thus by far was our favorite including my parents. Never gets old and Tim Allen's vulnerability as a new actor actually makes it more appealing. Love the bloopers as much as the show as they offer a glimpse of the family like set. You won't be disappointed!!!!!!!,1477353600,,428,4.296296296296297

2128267,4,B0002W4SWW,"I didn't spend much time watching TV until after I graduated from college, and by that point Home Improvement had pretty much finished its run.  However, I caught some episodes and liked what I saw.  So I headed back to season 1 to start from the beginning.

I think what surprised me most was just how much the early part of this season focused on theTaylorfamily.  Theres husband Tim (Tim Allen) the accident prone mans man and his wife Jill (Patricia Richardson) his long suffering wife.  They have three kids, Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), and Mark (Taran Noah Smith).  Tim is the host of his own home improvement show, Tool Time, where his co-host is Al Borland (Richard Karn, just a guest star here).  Theres also Lisa (Pamela Anderson), the announcer for the show.

The typical episode involves Tim going about doing things in the way he wants to, often ignoring Jills advice, and making a mess.  It can be something like adding too much to the remodel of their bathroom or sharing an embarrassing secret of Jills on Tool Time.  He doesnt quite get what hes done wrong until neighbor Wilson (Earl Hindman) sets him straight with some ancient philosophy or wisdom, which Tim mangles on his way to apologizing.

Of course, that pattern stayed true for most of the series.  This season specifically, Tim is distracted by a football game while on a date with Jill, has to teach the boys table manners or go to the opera, tries to get out of going to a fundraiser, and gets a table glued to his head.

Yes, this show involves plenty of slapstick humor as the accident prone/more power obsessed Tim goes too far.  Those moments are funny, and several of them are classics.  Many of the jokes involve verbal sparring, but the actors always keep the ton light and loving instead of harsh.

The acting is great from most of the cast.  Id say the weak link is Mark since hes the youngest, but hes cute enough to make up for it and its a minor issue.

My big complaints about the show are present here.  I already noted the formula.  Also, it would be nice if Tim weren't always so clueless when it comes to his wife and how what he does bothers her.  Only one episode in this season is Jill remotely responsible for the misunderstanding between them.  On the other hand, she is always ready to forgive, and I love the fact that they have a good marriage.

The season includes 24 episodes on three discs in their native full frame and stereo sound.  Extras include three interesting commentaries by the creators and some pointless theme collections of funny moments from the episodes youve just seen.

As formulaic as the show could be, it was a hit because it was always funny.  I laughed my way through the first season of Home Improvement and bet you will, too.",1432512000,,2787,4.557344064386318

The family setting is a bonus. I'd forgotten how nice it is to watch the goings-on of a family that is loving and close-knit, not shrill and crude, as TV families are these days.

Some of the references between Tim and Jill are of the adult variety, but it's not a bad thing to have the opportunity to explain the meanings of double entendres within the context of a loving marriage.

We've seen some shows from later years and haven't liked them as much as the earlier shows. Through the years, the focus seemed to have turned inward onto family issues and relationships.

2128346,4,B0002W4SWW,"Home Improvement is based around Tim Taylor (Tim Allen), a husband and father of three who has his own day-time television show called ""Tool Time"" (guess what that's about) with his pudgy and lovable sidekick, Al Borland (Richard Karn), who Tim loves to make fun of. Jill Taylor (Patricia Richardson) is Tim's intelligent and witty wife, and his three boys are Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), an environmentalist and hilarious jokester, Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), the jock and popular guy, and Mark (Taran Noah Smith), the youngest of the three and the ""goth"" boy. There is also Wilson Wilson, the Taylor's quirky and genius neighbor, who gives at least one the Taylor's advice in every episode. Inspired by one of Tim Allen's neighbor as a child, we never get to fully see Wilson's face.

Home Improvement has always stood out amongst all the dozens of hopeless sitcoms out there. While it is sometimes guilty of using cliches and overdone topics to revolve a show around, it manages to turn it from the same old thing to a fresh, clever, and hilarious episode. While it isn't the most realistic or unique sitcom out there, it's special because it is quality, good 'old ""family fun,"" that you can just pop in to brighten up your spirits. It's neat to watch the whole series in a row, because it's so interesting to see how the family evolves over time. In the first season Brad is getting into trouble at an arcade, and in the last season he's getting busted for smoking pot. But somehow Home Improvement has always managed to keep the same ""feel"" to it. Lots of shows seem to break away from what they once were. You can watch an episode from the first season and then one from the last and the characters and writing just seem completely and utterly different. But with Home Improvement, you always feel like you're watching the same family on tv, no matter how much they've evolved and changed. It's a show you can count on!",1322956800,,1926,4.6647058823529415

4. Tim goes to Jill and tells her a mixed-up version of what Wilson said. Jill doesn't understand.

2128381,5,B0002W4SWW,"Home Improvement: Season One started it all.  This is the season that Tim souped up his lawn mower, blew up the dishwasher, slipped a snake down his shirt, glued a table to his head, dyed his hands green, and knocked Bob Vila unconsious on his television show ""Tool Time.""  If you want Home Improvement at its best and in its classic state, Season 1 is the way to go.
We are introduced to the Taylor family, your typical clan of five, living their lives like the rest of Americans in the 1990's, but the Taylors are anything but normal.  There is Tim, the man of the house, ruling his family to the best of his ability but losing to his wife, Jill.  Tim's grunts and quest for power lead to visits from the fire department and journeys to the hospital.  If you enjoy seeing things get blown up, Home Improvement is the show for you!  If you enjoy drama, Home Improvement is the the show for you.  Jill Taylor, dedicated wife of Tim, attempts to restore order to the manly household, but Tim and their three boys will always make a comeback with something even more troubling than before.  Tim is always trying to outdo the most powerful tools with more power.
And when he screws up, Tim can always go to the fence in his back yard and talk to his neighbor Wilson who has something to say for any problem, helping Tim to get back on track only to screw up again another day.
You cannot forget Al, Tim's assistant on his daytime television show ""Tool Time,"" and his endless wardrobe of flannel.  Tim always has something to say ABOUT Al, whether it is in front of him or not, and Al always has something to say to Tim: ""I don't think so, Tim.""
So come on into the living room, pop Home Improvement: Season 1 into the DVD player and enjoy a series that will NEVER fail to make you laugh.  Whether it is Tim screwing up a project or powering up his lawnmower.  If it is Wilson's wise, but strange advice, or Al's professionalism that make you laugh, then the job is done and you will be sucked in.  Keep watching and you will realize that there is no other show that will take you where Home Improvement does.",1201392000,,2105,4.32824427480916

2128403,5,B0002W4SWW,"During the late 80's and 90's many TV shows were based on the comedy of some stand-up comedian or another.  Seinfeld (a show about ""Nothing""), Drew Carry, etc.  They were too many to count...

I enjoyed most of these genre of shows, I loved visiting the comedy clubs with my father and/or brother as a teen, so naturally the comedy of these guys was in my blood.

However, as someone who wishes they could be as funny as some of these guys, I have to say that the best comedy is NOT when you poke fun of others but when you poke fun of yourself...

I grew up telling jokes that always came around to make me the butt of the joke...  Everyone can laugh and no ones gets feelings hurt.

Seinfeld is the only ""normal"" person on his show.  Everyone else is crazy, wierd or just a looser.  His jokes are all about other people and the stupid things they do.  He is only firends with them to be sure he is always the ""coolest"" guy in the group...

Drew Carry, was pretty much an Ohio version of Seinfeld...

BUT, Home Imporovement was all about making fun of Tim Allen and his Character Tim ""the Toolman"" Taylor.  I grew-up around tools, car repair and home improvement.  I grew-up around ""men's men"" and the one thing I learned about being a man...  ""real men don't have to prove they are real men!""

Tim makes fun of men who worry about being a ""real man"", while his character is trying sooo hard to be a ""real man""...

I think they have 8 seasons, I have 2 so far and have ordered the third...  If you want BETTER TV than what is available today, get this, you'll laugh, you'll laugh and then you'll laugh.

After that,I turned to Frazier. Now every new show(example King of Queens)is about the loveable but unfortunately very stupid husband who loves sports and knows cars but very little else. And,of course,the overbearing,obnoxious and smart wife who bails them out of problems a two year old would know to avoid. Case in point from this very show, Tim uses Jill's driver's liscense photo at an event that really matters to her because he forgot to get any other photos because he was too busy farting,scratching and watching football. It got to the point of being offensive to men that this was accepted as a fair and accurate representation of all men. How long do you think a show about a bunch of ridiculously stupid women would last? Let me answer that, about 1 episode before the cry of ""discrimination against women"" would begin.

2128429,2,B0002W4SWW,"Home Improvement showcases the comedic talent of Tim Allen and his portrait of the well-meaning but insecure, harassed modern American male. Allen and his TV show sidekick Richard Karn are great, as is the neighbor Wilson.

However, all of this is tarnished and diminished by the razor-blade edged attitudes and jabs of Allen's on-screen wife, played by Patricia Rishardson. Her character nearly ruins the entire season. While it is vital that a wife display personal strength and maintain her own identity, Richardson's portrayl of Jill Patterson-Taylor as a wife that is constantly antagonizing, provoking, and humiliating her husband in order to show her independence is enough to make most men swear off marriage. Her constant demeaning of her husband's interests and accomplishments simply adds insult to injury. Marriage is designed to be a partnership between friends and lovers, not a constant sparring match.

Sadly, while the production values are excellent, and the comedic talents of Tim Allen are fun, the constant arguing between the Taylor's ruins most of it. It's fun for a while, but the sharpness of the conflict wears a person out. Our family never finished watching the episodes.",1123977600,4,1199,5.272251308900524
2128430,4,B0002W4SWW,"When it comes to shows like ""Home Improvement"" that are aired in syndication seemingly a dozen times a day in any given market (when you account for cable and local station airings), it becomes very important for the DVD presentation to provide something extra.

Thankfully, this set provides the most important thing first: UNCUT episodes. As most fans by now know, most if not all shows are edited down when put into syndication. Usually, a couple of minutes are trimmed. This, as well as the second and presumably all seasons sets of ""Home Improvement"" feature unedited shows as they originally aired. This is important, because over the course of a season's worth of episodes, about two episode's worth of running time is cut when two minutes are clipped from each episode.

Visually, this set looks as good as it possibly could. Early 90's videotape. It sounds just fine as well.

The rest of the extras aren't much. The three commentary tracks are pretty interesting. They're a bit dry, but very informative overall. It's a shame they couldn't put more commentaries on this set. There were no commentaries for the second season set.

The ""Loose Screws"" montage is not really an extra, as it simply slices up little bits of footage from the actual episodes.

Apart from perhaps offering more extras (more commentaries, documentaries, etc.), this set is perfect. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.",1123977600,5,1402,4.89873417721519
2128431,4,B0002W4SWW,"Most of the shows are funny, yes, but the best part of Home Improvement were the bloopers at the end of each episode which were lacking on this set!  There were only a few. And the so-called extras, which I thought were bloopers, were just a rehash of what we just watched.  Please include everything next time!!!",1123545600,2,313,4.473684210526316
2128432,5,B0002W4SWW,"Nominated for 9 Golden Globes and 34 Emmys, including 2 for Outstanding Comedy Series, Home Improvement was the number one family-friendly comedy for most of the 1990's decade. Created by three writers who worked on wide range of sitcoms, such as The Cosby Show (1984) and Roseanne (1988), Home Improvement is one of a number of 1990's smash hit sitcoms built around a lead character who stars as a stand-up comic in real life. Some of the other series include Seinfeld (1990), The Drew Carey Show (1995), Everybody Loves Raymond (1996), and King Of Queens (1998) among others. One of the trailblazers in this area, Home Improvement ranked in the Top 10 among Nielsen-rated shows for seven of its eight seasons (it ranked #11 in Season 7). One notable tidbit of trivia is that Sears was approached to sponsor the show which would've put Craftsman tools in the hands of Tim ""The Toolman"" Taylor (as opposed to the fictional ""Binford"" brand), but Sears rejected the offer because they feared Tim Allen's prior conviction on a drug charge might be interpreted as unfriendly to families (funny, since Home Improvement later fell under the moniker of the Walt Disney Company)...

Home Improvement centers around the life of Tim Taylor (Tim Allen), a home improvement expert who hosts his own local TV show ""Tool Time"" on cable access. Tim and his wife Jill (Patricia Richardson) live in a house in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan with their three boys Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), and Mark (Taran Noah Smith). On ""Tool Time,"" Tim is flanked by the flannel-clad, easy-going Al Borland (Richard Karn) who is often the butt of Tim's jokes and harbors a neurotic tendency toward perfectionism. At home, Tim's numerous domestic missteps lead him to continuously seek the advice of his well-traveled, near-perfect neighbor Wilson (Earl Hindman), whose lower face is never seen (only his eyes)... Marked by Tim's abundant clumsiness as a home improvement guru and his inept ability to display sensitivity toward his wife, Home Improvement is a classic sitcom that relies on formulaic episodes of slapstick humor and zinging one-liners. It's a formula that works, but grows tiresome as the show progresses...

The Home Improvement (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere in which Jill goes to a job interview after telling Tim not to mess with the dishwasher. But Tim inevitably ruins the dishwasher when his attempt to super-charge it goes awry. When the job interviewers pass her over, Jill returns home dejected, and Tim only makes things worse - leaving room for a bit of Wilson advice to save the day for Tim... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Flying Sauces"" in which the K&B Construction guys show off their jobsite cooking skills on Tool Time while Tim and Jill plot revenge on their eldest boys, and ""What About Bob?"" in which Tim cheats in a Tool Time trivia contest in order to beat guest Bob Vila...

Some of ""Home Improvement's"" finest moments are within this set.  Buy it!",1118016000,2,247,5.3076923076923075
2128453,5,B0002W4SWW,"If you ask me, there's nothing like trying to push wimpy underpowered factory products to their limits by modifying them (I do it myself all the time).  I think this show is incredibly funny, Tim's ""Tool Time"" show, the next door neighbor Wilson's advice that Tim always screws up, adding more power to things 'normal' people would never even be concerned with, and even in the midst of all this chaos we get good and 'real-world' plots too.

my favorite I think in this set is ""Bubble Bubble Toil and Trouble"" where Tim starts a bathroom project, turns it into a Tool Time Remote that everything goes wrong on, Whirlpool wouldn't fit, concrete spill, water main busted, lots of good action and some badly messed up lines from advice wilson gave! this perticular show had me cracking up pretty good!

I can't wait for season 2, already on pre-order",1115424000,4,848,4.677852348993288
2128454,4,B0002W4SWW,"Home Improvement was on the air at a time when sitcoms were a good source of bread and butter for network television. During its prime, Home Improvement made its share of money for ABC, as the show appealed to a broad audience, from kids to adults.

The complete first season of Home Improvement takes us back to the very beginning of the show. We meet Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor, the host of a local cable home improvement show, his wife Jill and their three kids. While much of the show dealt with the television show, the prime focus was on the family aspect of Tim's life and how it affected his work and vice versa.

Stand-up comedian Tim Allen brought the character of Tim Taylor to life. His observations about everyday life, along with his penchant for getting himself into fine messes, usually involving ""more power,"" made for some interesting situations. While Tim is by no means a stupid guy, he quite often misinterprets advice given to him by his neighbor Wilson, or the meaning of any number of things that his wife says. Somehow he always manages to get everything to work out the way it needs to. If only life were so easy.

Patricia Richardson stars as Tim's wife Jill. She is the perfect co-star for Allen. While she can stay in the background as he goes off on his antics, she is also quite capable of stepping into the spotlight with some great jokes of her own. As the only woman in a house full of males, she finds herself constantly outnumbered, but usually manages to get her way.

Zachery Ty Bryan, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Taran Noah Smith star as the Taylors' three kids. Through the years viewers got to watch the kids grow and got to see how their parents influenced them as they grew up. Looking back, the kids look incredibly young in this very first season. It is amazing just how much older they look at the end of the show. The kids have some great moments, mainly with the older two picking on their younger brother, but the focus of the show is the family, and if the kids do something wrong, the parents are there to try to teach them right from wrong.

Richard Karn stars as Al, Tim's assistant and Earl Hindman stars as Wilson. Both characters provide some great supporting parts and it is interesting to see all the ways that the show's powers that be find to hide Wilson face, which is never fully visible. The show also started the career of Pamela Anderson, who was Lisa, the original Tool Time girl.

Two of the show's producers provide commentary on a number of episodes, and the commentary is quite interesting and a good addition to the set. This set is worth the purchase for anyone who remembers the good days of television sitcoms.",1115078400,19,2682,4.508230452674897
2128455,5,B0002W4SWW,"If you like Everyone Loves Raymond, you will like Home Improvements.  Every episode is kid friendly.  There is always a good mix of adult humor and humor that appeals to even the youngest person in the family.  The wacky family situations in the series are not all that different from real family experiences.  My kids ask to watch this before anything else.  Looking forward to the other seasons!",1105315200,8,397,4.779411764705882
2128456,5,B0002W4SWW,This is one of the best TV sitcoms.  Season 1 - when it all began!!!!,1105228800,,69,3.6
2128457,5,B0002W4SWW,This has fast become my favorite DVD to watch. It is a relaxing and enjoyable alternative to what's on TV these days. I bought it for the episodes - not the extras. So I really don't care about the abundance or quality of the extras. I can't wait for season two!,1105056000,5,262,4.1568627450980395
2128458,5,B0002W4SWW,"I received this DVD collection of Home Improvement from my kids for Christmas. They scored some big brownie points with this gift! I had originally tried to catch the reruns on cable and tape them off for watching at a later time. Now I can pitch the tapes!

The DVDs are really nice to have. The only negative I can make is that there are NO outtakes. I expected them to be there at the end of the show but there aren't any. I find them to be just as funny or funnier than the shows and added an element of entertainment that 99% of the other sitcoms didn't have. It helped make Home Improvement more unique. Maybe when Buena Vista releases the other seasons on DVD they can include the outtakes? Even without them the DVDs are worth buying.",1104451200,2,742,4.3
2128459,5,B0002W4SWW,"Ever since ""Home Improvement"" came on in 1991, millions of people have watched it.  Today, re-runs of this show are still shown on televison, and ""Home Improvement"" has even found some new viewers.  I have loved this show since I was seven years old, and I remember watching every episode every night.  Years later, this show still kicks, and it is a miracle to see that ""Home Improvement"" has finally made it's way to DVD.  This DVD has three discs, and there are eight episodes on each disc.  Yes, all the laughs are here.  All the grunts are here.  But most importantly, all of the great episodes which were all made during season one are all here.  There is no behind the scenes look at the show, and there are no interviews with the cast members, but there are two commentaries on disc one and one commentary on disc two, and on disc three, there is ""Loose Screws"", a certain thing from this show where people talked about how much they loved Al, Tim with his kids, Wilson giving advice to his neighbors, and seveal other features (there are nine ""Loose Screws"") which are all pretty funny. Also, if you purchase this DVD, a free 2005 calendar that has a picture of Pamela Anderson comes with it. Before I got this DVD, I had seen every season one episode, and it is great not just to have them all on DVD, but to get to watch them anytime I want to.  Hope they release a season two DVD!",1104105600,5,1392,4.364341085271318
2128460,5,B0002W4SWW,I love this show and to musical j. this is a half hour television series from 5-6 pm on tbs superstation staring TIM ALLEN on Santa Claus. This is such a FABULOUS show. Eveybody knows who Tim Allen is honey.,1103068800,,207,4.2
2128471,2,B0002W4SWW,"I really enjoy watching Home Improvement.  (The show itself would get 5 stars!) I was able to get in to watch the show taped twice.  I've visited every Disney store I was ever around to ask why they didn't have HI merchandise and asked the store people to make the suggestion to higher ups.

I was signed up for notice of the release of these on Amazon several months before it came out.  I forwarded the information to many of my friends who also enjoy the show.

I love having all 24 episodes, commercial free in DVD quality video and sound.

HOWEVER, it gets only 2 stars because there are virtually no extras.  There is commentary by writers, producers or someone on THREE episodes.  THREE?  Why not get some of the cast involved.  Why not do ALL of the episodes.  This looks like just enough effort to be able to say ""commentary available"" or something like it on the case.

Extras?  About 10 minutes of collected moments from the show grouped into 9 topics like Tim Grunting, Jill's bites, Wilson's Intro's, Al's Comebacks and some more.  While it is entertaining (minimally) it is only barely worth considering as an extra.  In my opinion, it shouldn't even count as an extra because it's nothing that isn't in the episodes anyway.

Having watched the DVD's of other ""TV Seasons"" with cast and crew commentary on every episode, outtakes, interviews and other ""insider information"" I was very disappointed.

There are NO out takes.  That's right NONE.  The first season doesn't even include the ones at the end of the show - these were introduced in later seasons.  Having seen filming twice, I can tell you that as good as HI is, the stuff that gets cut is many times FAR, FAR funnier than what made the screen.

I'm not sorry I bought them.  I'll buy several more seasons.  I'm just disappointed that the studio didn't spend more time beefing up the offering.  Future purchases will certainly not be made with anywhere near the sense of expectation.  I'll probably just wait a few months until after the releases and pick them up used. I guess I just hoped for too much from Buena Vista.",1102032000,33,2095,4.597297297297297
2128472,5,B0002W4SWW,"Tim Allen turned a clever stand-up routine as a baboon- grunting macho man into a hit ABC sitcom (1991-99). He plays accident-prone Tim ""the Tool Man"" Taylor, who never met a power tool he didn't lust after. Keeping him level are his stable wife, Patricia Richardson, and deadpan Richard Karn. DVD extras: show highlights, commentary on three episodes - but not by the cast. Three discs, 24 episodes, 566 minutes.",1101859200,4,413,4.914285714285715

I am afraid to watch too much too quick because, as it is known, sugar can give you a stomach ache when eaten too fast in large quantities. When I recieved my package from Amazon (earlier than they had told me), I felt absolutely euphoric. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THE REST OF THE SEASONS INTO DVD'S!

It teaches people a lot.  Home is not a nice home without a nice family.  This show, just like its name, teaches people how to improve their home truly - by improving their relationship with their family first.  No matter how many seasons there will be, I'm absolutely, and definitely, going to buy all of them - maybe not just one set, one for watch and one for collection.",1101340800,3,531,4.36734693877551
2128475,4,B0002W4SWW,"I always loved this show. I wish it was still on tv now. Anyway it's about time it's coming out on dvd. Tim Allen (The Santa Clause, Big Trouble) stars as Tim the Toolman Taylor. He's an expert on tools and fixing stuff and even has his own tv show. Yet he always winds up destroying something or injuring himself. . He knows a lot about tools but isn't the best at using them.

  He also gets in trouble with his wife in pretty much every episode. When he does that he goes over to see his nextdoor neighbor Wilson for advice. We only see half of Wilson's face at a time in each episode which is also pretty funny. Tim's partner Al who wears plaid and is a mamma's boy also gets some laughs. The show is always fun mostly because of Tim Allen though. No one could play this goofy and loveable guy in love with cars and tools better than he does. So eventhough his kids on the show got older it still could've gone on without them. Not like they were the strength of the show anyway. His chemestry with Patricia Richardson as his wife Jill was always strong. The kids do get some laughs I guess but as years went on I think they got annoying. If you threw them in college and just made it Tim, Jill, Al and Wilson's show it still would've been great.",1100476800,6,1250,4.1570247933884295

2128477,2,B0002W4SWW,"This is a decent show, but I'd suggest renting it first, then deciding if it's worth spending the money on it.

Sure the eps are funny, but how many times can you rewatch them?

With shows like Friends, Mad about You, and Everybody Loves Raymond, I can watch the same ep over and over and still be laughing.

With Home Improvement, one viewing of an ep, is plenty for me.

I do plan to rent it, when it comes out, because I'd like to see most of the eps,and the special features at least once, but I won't be buying it.",1100044800,5,519,4.108910891089109
2128478,5,B0002W4SWW,"It's about time they came out with Season 1 on DVD. I have been wondering about this for quite some time now, and every time I see a TV show come out on DVD, even the older ones, such as I Love Lucy. I have all the episodes recorded on VHS. Now I can have them on DVD and throw away the tapes! I am sooooo excited! I can't wait until Christmas! I want it now! I could watch these episodes over and over again. They have happy, sad, and funny moments, which is why this show is the best show ever. It is better than the new ones that have just premiered and the ones that will be coming out in the future. I urge you to buy this DVD. It is worth your money! I have seen every episode, obviously since I have all of them on tape. It will be worth it to watch them on DVD, especially since it will have a clear crisp picture. This item will be #1 on my Christmas list, well, it is now!

Not this show - my Wife even says to me - haven't you already seen this episode to which I reply ""nearly thirty times and it still gives me the same laughs as it did the first time I saw it!""",1098748800,11,555,3.793103448275862
