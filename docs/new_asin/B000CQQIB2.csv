2470055,3,B000CQQIB2,"Gundam Seed Destiny is one of those TV series you have to take with as many grains of salt as the episode requires. Whilst some of the material is pretty good here (i.e. Episodes 1-15 or so) Once it goes downhill, it goes DOWNHILL.  *SPOILERS*

With episode 1, we are given quite a bit of promise. After a very dramatic scene in which the wannabe hero of the series Shinn Asuka has his family killed, he sees the Freedom, Raider, Calamity and Forbidden Gundams battling it, one little misfire and his parents and sister are kaput. He falls to his knees, screams, and there you go. Then we go to the PLANTS, where the remainder are all good stuff,  although it is kind of a recycled idea.

A few Earth Alliance pilots go into a plant, Cagalli is discussing things with ZAFT's new chairman Gilbert Durandal, and all of a sudden, after a few minutes later, the EA Pilots break into a hanger, shoot up engineers, and as the music swells, they jump into the cockpits of the Alliance's newest Gundams. Sting Oklay, a green haired guy (I guess the leader of the group) jumps into the ZGMF-X24S Chaos Gundam, Auel Nander, a blue haired guy who likes picking of Stella (the girl of the group) jumps into the ZGMF-X31S Abyss Gundam, and Stella Lousser, the uber sensitive really odd girl jumps into the Gundam BuCu....er.....ZGMF-X88S Gaia Gundam. Okay, there we go. Peacetime, Pilots sneak into colony, people get killed, Gundams get stolen. A formula for success. (Hey, it worked in 0083 and SEED 1).

The 3 stolen Gundams wreak havok, people scream, yell, die, and Athrun and Cagalli (the two lovers of this season) conveniantly find a Zaku Warrior suit (No, not the UC suit, it's a Destiny ZAFT suit called a Zaku ((with GOUFS and DOMS to come later in the series)) and start fighting the Gundams. Not long after, we hear a rousing track, and bang swish zoom, out comes the ""Core Splendor"" with none other than Shinn Asuka (remember him?) flying fancy, and just like a page out of Victory Gundam, 3 Gundam flyers come together to create the Sword Impulse Gundam.

Excited yet?

Well, personally, I didn't mind it so much (dispite my more cynical commentary). I mean, the action, story and characters of this first episode give much promise.

Okay, so over the next five or so episodes, we are introduced to a shady new villan. ZECH....uh....NEO! Neo Roanoke, the devious masked man of the Earth Alliance. I forgot to mention, the first part of this series takes on the perspective of ZAFT, and the warship Minerva. So there is the basic outline of the story. Good guys: ZAFT...I think.. and the Bad Guys: OMNI...for now.

Confused yet?

Okay, so the series continues on, in the grand tradition. A radical group takes over the remains of Junius Seven, and try to drop it on Earth, people on earth get pissed, and start calling for the eradication of the Coordinators (The genetically enhanced people of the PLANTS and the army of ZAFT.)

Meanwhile, a new figurehead, the new leader of the Extremest Earth Faction, The ""Blue Cosmos"" Lord Dijbril, enters stage, and plots all sorts of sick stuff.

Interested yet?

Well, this isn't even half the story. Needless to say, we get to see more action later on. All in all, this DVD Box will contain some of the best episodes of the series. You can get it now for a discount, and get a free CD and collection box, so don't delay! Note: Again, my cynical approach in this review doesn't mean I don't like the series. Actually, the beginning of Destiny is pretty good. I'm cynical because it's the END of the series which totally lets you down. But, if you like the series SEED, or somehow saw Seed Destiny in it's original Japanese format, or you're just looking for a new series with lots of action, lots of fun and oh yes, lots of GUNDAMS! and if you've bought the toys and want to see the Impulse, Saviour,Gaia, Chaos, Abyss, and all others in action, than this limited release, Collectors Box Edition is for you. If you hated SEED, or haven't seen any Gundam yet, then buy with caution.

Finally, if you loved Gundam Seed Destiny because you have already seen it, and think I'm wrong, then please don't say this wasn't helpful. If you have bought this DVD, or are looking to buy this DVD, and found it was absolutly terrible or wonderful, or still can't decide to buy it on ACCOUNT of my review, then fine, but that's what the ""Helpful"" thing is for. Not for people who don't agree with my logic or opinion of the series. Look,  Buy, then bash me. :)",1142208000,2,4488,4.564676616915423
2470056,5,B000CQQIB2,"I just wanted to warn people that this is not a box set. It includes volume one of the series and a box so that you can put the other volumes (once released) into. It is not the whole series. Anyways, Gundam Seed Destiny is a great sequel to the hit show Gundam Seed. It continues to struggle between the Earth Forces and ZAFT. The relationships between characters grows stronger after the relationship between Kira and Athrun is once again tested. This season focuses on Shinn Asuka, a former Orb citizen who loses his family in the battle between Orb/Archangel & the Earth Forces from season 1. His hate towards Cagalli Yula Atha is due to the fact that her father, former leader of Orb, involved the country in war. Many new and wonderful characters are introduced into the story like Shinn Asuka, Rey Za Burrel, Meyrin and Luna Hakwe, Gilbert Dullindal, Tallia Gladys, Meer Campbell and Stellar Loussier. If you liked Gundam Seed you will LOVE Gundam Seed Destiny. The first episode catches your attention instantly.",1141776000,,1020,4.768361581920904
2470057,5,B000CQQIB2,"Gundam Seed Destiny is mainly more of the same from Gundam Seed, so fans of Gundam Seed are almost guaranteed to enjoy it. Everything you've come to expect is here, including endearing characters, a worthwhile plot, and more flashy mecha action than you can shake a stick at.

Some criticisms have been leveled at this series, but their validity depends on how critical you are. It's true that recycled footage is a bit of a problem in this series, but the severity of this problem has been overstated. You'll come to recognize the stock footage that is used pretty quickly, but most battles also have plenty of new footage to keep them interesting, and to be fair, even the stock footage is frequently dressed or changed up enough that it isn't exactly the same every time. To say that you're ""watching the same battle over and over again"" is an overstatement.

The same is true for flashbacks. In a series that is 50 episodes long, only a couple of episodes are dedicated exclusively to recapping, and flashbacks are sprinkled at intervals through the remaining episodes - but I personally never found their use to be excessive enough to truly irritate me. Besides, this is not a problem exclusive to Gundam Seed Destiny. Anime is notoriously low budget and shortcuts like recycled footage and use of flashbacks are common ways to get around that limitation. A true hardcore anime fan will probably not be surprised by the use of these techniques in this series, nor think they are severely overused.

Critical individuals who expect never to see a reused scene or to get a perfect show out of a limited budget may come to dislike Destiny. Also, anyone who isn't a fan of sci-fi mecha action will probably not find much to love here either. But for any serious Gundam fan, or any serious fan of sci-fi or mecha based anime, there is a lot to love in Destiny. The strengths of this series - excellent animation and characterization, a plot that is worth following, and consistently superb action sequences - more than make up for the flaws, which are primarily sometimes-overused stock footage and recaps/flashbacks.

As for the first DVD, none of the aforementioned problems are present in the first DVD at all. There is almost no stock footage and no flashback scenes - nothing but strengths. The problems don't appear until later in the series. So it's hard to go wrong with the first DVD, but one should be aware of potential difficulties down the line if they intend to pick up the entire series.",1141344000,2,2502,4.731651376146789
2470058,3,B000CQQIB2,"First off please note that I am NOT reviewing the DVD itself, but the show. This review holds no bearing on Extras, or DVD quality! With that out of the way we may continue to my review of the show itself.

Gundam SEED Destiny, the show that's love to show itself over and over again, and by this, I mean recap episodes and flashbacks. Mitsuo Fukuda, the director, is famous for that it seems. Although if you can see past that this is a great show... unless you like a show that doesn't feel like its changing main characters every ten episodes. I forget, is Shinn the main character? Or wait, no! It was Athrun right? Oh no! Now it's Kira! Oh wait, its Shinn again, oh now it's Kira. Destiny should have taken a tip from Zeta, don't let old characters over shadow the new main character! With all the importance placed upon Shinn's past it seems weird that the show is handed over to Athrun after a short amount of time. The show soon becomes Athrun and his sidekicks on the Minerva.

Another problem is the show is how it changes gears in a manor that creates confusion in a bad way. I like most other fans of anime, like some mystery in my show. I like it when there is a person who you don't know what to think of. Is he good? Is she good? Wait, he's bad now? Is he really who he says he is? Yes, those are the kinds of mystery we all like, the shady organization who seems like its doing good, but is really doing bad, but in the end are they really on the same level as the good guys? Yeah, that's anime for you, it's a little tricky and fun to try to figure out. I'll tell you what's not fun, a show jerking you around with plot change and choppy story telling. Some of this has to do with flash backs, and some of it has to do with not giving answers. Both are major problems.

I'll say this about the show is it starts off amazingly! The first 10 to 14 episodes are really great stuff, full of the things that make those of us who love Gundam really remember why we love it so much, its action packed, suspenseful, dramatic, and has great story telling. As the show goes on it has its ups and downs, but over all it is in the middle to lower ground with a few episodes here and there really standing out as &#8220;Good&#8221;.

As far as the shows animation goes, its good quality, but that really doesn't matter if you're watching the same mobile suit explode over and over again. Then, to take it a step further, they actually use stock Gundam SEED footage and try to pass it off as new by throwing in a new mobile suit or two. Of course you won't notice this so much early on in the show but as time goes on you realize every battle is pretty much the same, just a change of background or mobile suits. Although this happened in Gundam SEED as well, rather sad that as the animation gets better, the quality truly goes down.

All in all if you really liked Gundam SEED, then by all means WATCH THIS SHOW. If you're a casual Gundam fan then watch something more worth while, such as Gundam SEED, 08th MS Team, Gundam 0080, or if you can get your hands on it Turn A Gundam. Gundam SEED Destiny is a weak follow up to SEED, but for those of us who just cant get enough, Bandai is throwing you another bone and hoping you'll come back for seconds. And no matter how bad the show, us die hard fans always do come back for more.",1139097600,7,3335,4.156346749226006
2470059,5,B000CQQIB2,"For those of you who don't know Mobile Suite Gundam Seed Destiny is the sequel to the popular series Gundam Seed.  The story takes place 2 years after the first alliance, Zaft war. Unlike Gundam Seed , Destiny put you on the side of Zaft for the first half of the series and then reintroduces main characters such as Kira Yamato and the rest of the archangel crew. It has new mech better animation and like its predecessor an awsome soundtrack. This series is a must get for anyone who liked the original Gundam Seed.",1137110400,10,517,4.442105263157894

8100617,5,B000CQQIB2,"Being new to the anime scene this was the first anime I ever bought, and I must say I am thoughoughly impressed.  I've since bought volumes 2 and 3 and have plans to buy the rest, in increments.  Great series!  My only suggestion is, go buy the series Gundamn Seed first, as there are events that Destiny refers to that might confuse you if you had not seen the series before.",1178928000,,376,4.267605633802817
8100618,5,B000CQQIB2,"This is an amazing series, far superior to the first. This time better more rounded characters are introduced and existing characters are explored. Starting with the tragedy at Orb, a young boy is thrust into a war that takes a swift and savage momentum, a war of mobile suits, gigantic battle fleets and tested relationships. The Japanese soundtrack really nails each character from the often clumsey Arthur to the slightly mad Shinn the voices perfectly encapsulate the persona of each character. However the English dub is terrible. Most of the characters sound like they're 12 and just thats the older ones. The dialoge written for the english cast struggles to match the original dialogue and some voice choices seem terrible as characters like stellar, Auel, Arthur, shinn, and many more seem to be lacking in effort. It may be that the dub was rushed or the acting quality available was poor, but this really does let down the animation.

  In conclusion this is a great series to watch if you watch it as it was origionaly broadcast. Animes like Love hina, and Full metal panic managed to capture the characters realy well with their English dub the same saldy cannot be said for Gundam seed Destiny.",1176595200,,1208,4.854368932038835
8100619,3,B000CQQIB2,"As you read this I would like you to keep in mind that this is my impression from one viewing of the series which ended about 6 months ago. This review is a review of the original Japanese airing as I have no interest in the English dub. Thus, the English version will not be mentioned.

Gundam Seed Destiny is not a well made show. However, Gundam Seed Destiny is a great guilty pleasure. It's almost as if Sunrise went, ""what if we let the fans dictate the direction of the series?"" This is pretty evident, given the development of character relationships, direction of events in the plot and the shift of the main hero to the old series' hero halfway through.

In effect, it's fanservice. 50 episodes plus one special (and movies, soon) worth of fanservice. It's pretty much a soap opera for teenagers. The good part about this is, once you're done with all the Ideons and Evangelions out there you can sit down and watch this mindless war/love/drama story without it taxing your mind too much. It's a good show just to chill out to and enjoy.

There are some flaws that cannot be tolerated, though. While the actual animation is a big step up from the cel-sliding of Seed; the over-use of recycled animation is off putting. The fact that they dug up footage from the original Seed to use in the final episodes just made those episodes come off as extremely weak. I hear a number of animation mistakes were changed in the Japanese DVD release, I hope this carries over to the American DVDs. There are also far too many flashbacks and full-on recaps. One can only see a certain death so many times before it loses its impact. The painfully uninspired mechanical designs don't help anything either. The character designs are hit and miss with most people-- I like them. They're just the same as the original Seed, so fans  pretty much know what to expect.

I think one thing people can all agree on is that the voice acting and the music are all well done. The background music is a lot more polished than the original Seed and provides good dramatic backing for certain scenes while each theme song sets the tone for the series. The voice acting is very well done. Each seiyuu pulls off their roles very convincingly, no matter how ridiculous the story is. I am a fan of Rie Tanaka's work on Lacus, my self.

If you're looking to start Gundam, I feel the Seed series is probably a good way to ease the kids into it. However, if you're looking for a mature and compelling war story, I highly suggest you pick up First Gundam (the 1979 original, a Japanese boxset is due out soon) and then Zeta Gundam. Actually, watching the entire Universal Century series will probably fill you with enough ""mature war stories"" to last you lifetime. Honestly, when compared to the UC classics that have stood the test of time for 20+ years, one really wonders how the Seed series will fare.

I will still buy these DVDs (I am actually looking forward to it), but for anyone who isn't familiar with the show, be ready to get what you've paid for-- an animated fanfiction.",1146268800,12,3056,4.52536231884058
8100620,5,B000CQQIB2,"I came into the whole Gundam universe with the Gundam Wing Series. Personally, I'm a hugh fan of Gundam Seed and Seed Destiny and I'm looking forward to Gundam Seed Stargazer. I have both the Gundam seed series and well as the Zeta Gundam series so your the opinion of someone who has both. Personally I thought Zeta Gundam was good but I think Seed is a whole lot better. Unlike the previoue Gundam series, Seed makes most of the science in Gundam as well as a lot of the war aspects real. Zeta seems like it was more for kids than anything. Seed and Seed Destiny show what tends to really happen in a war and how people respond to it. Other Gundam series seem to have Gundam's with unlimited ammo and energy. At least seed shows you the reality of it. Also people complained that the series kept switching from main character to main character. Obviously the series main characters were Kira, Athrun and Shin. Even I noticed that. Focus was shifted to show what personal problems each one faced. When you look at each character in depth, Kira has a higher understanding and knows what must be none. Athrun tends towards following what he's told but then figuries things out. Shinn is basically a Kira with Athruns trait to follow. When you look at it, Kira's a brain, Athrun's strenght and Shinn is a gun. I don't think to bad mouthing people been giving SEED is fair. The only thing I agree with is that I do think they reused animation a bit too often. I noticed to reuse watching to show just one time. I hope then don't do this in Stargazer.",1145750400,2,1547,4.4125874125874125
8100621,2,B000CQQIB2,"I have to admit, this show started well....alright. I was alittle ticked on the unoriginality of reusing old MS designs like the Zaku, Dom, Gouf, etc. But besides that the show started just as strong as any other anime would have. But, as many others agree, it goes on a steady decline into the ""Its just not worth it zone"". Don't get me wrong, I stuck with this to the end, and my expectations weren't very high, but repeated animation to its upmost extreme, a crappy reused script, and poor character development really overshadows all the fighting and cool beams flying in random directions. So to conclude, the animation is appealing (as limiting to new drawings as it is), but the story slowing declines into a 3rd grade fiction english paper. It really could have been better. *And yes, their are scenes copied from Zeta as exact as the angle the characters are looking, its kinda sad, even if this is abviously a new gen. zeta remake*",1145491200,5,941,4.640718562874252
8100622,4,B000CQQIB2,"I have NEVER seen Gundam Seed Destiny until now. So pretty much, I'm a first timer. According to what I'm hearing from friends and  critics like you, Destiny has a love hate reputation (SEED in general, actually) among Gundam junkies. Some say it's just good all-around, including the story and the characters. Some say it copies Zeta Gundam and that it isn't very interesting at all. Based on what I've seen on the first volume, the story is deep and engaging. Just like the original SEED and the other original Gundams, except for G and Wing, it showcases the harsh realities of war and the hardships of maintaing freedom and peace in the universe. So far, I'm impressed with Destiny!

I have yet to see what the flaws are on this series overall. I did notice that it does mimic Zeta Gundam. The only flaw I can name right now, are the same horrible english voices featured on the first Gundam Seed. I personally hated Kira's english voice with a passion. What the heck am I saying? I hated all of the english voices featured in this anime, period! If you're looking for an anime with a good English dub, check out Cowboy Bebop!

As for the box, I'm quite pleased with the way it looks. The design is neat, and the idea of a magnetic seal to protect the content from being damaged, is not half bad at all. And plus, it's cool to look at. You'll know what I mean, once you unfold it. The design is original, but there's only one problem with the box, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize what the problem is. This box only holds six volumes of the series. Seriously, I don't know what the heck Bandai was thinking while they were making this box. But it seemed to me that they were just focusing on the design of the box, and never thought of putting more slots for the other four volumes. Instead of 10 slots, we get six.

Unless Bandai either...

a) ...release a second collectors box for the other volumes, which would be just plain ludicrous (more likely to happen)...

b) ...put more episodes on the next volumes, rather than putting five episodes per DVD or...

c) ...just like the individually released Zeta Gundam DVD releases, put two discs on one single case...

...this box is somewhat a disappointment. It would be a damn shame if they did stop at 30 episodes or have us collect another box. It would've gotten five stars if they had stuck with the basic concept from the original Gundam Seed Limited Edition Box. It's cool that we have a foldable art box with hidden magnets to keep the box closed. Not to mention, a soundtrack with a fair amount of good songs featured in the anime. But I know Bandai could do better than that! However I wouldn't be surprised if they did Option A (look above). I mean, after all an extra box is needed for the other volumes. It wouldn't make any sense if they just made one box especially for the six volumes.

I'm very sure I'll be impressed with the series as a whole. I'm already into it! But like I said, I have yet to see what the flaws are on this series. Gundam SEED, to me, was a masterpiece. I have high expectations on Destiny. That does sound biased, but I'm just loving this series overall.

Hope this helps...",1143763200,3,3184,4.427350427350428
8100623,4,B000CQQIB2,"The first thing that struck me was the strange and interesting box for the series.  It folds out flat and has slots for six DVD's.  That's the weird part- this series is supposed to be 50 episodes long, with a 45 min OVA.  How is that supposed to fit 6 DVD's and the first one only has five episodes on it?  Anyways, the box is nice and sturdy and has great art work on the outside and on the inside.

The CD was a bit of a disappointment, though the songs are great, it only has six of the ten or more openings and endings along with a good 5 or 6 insert songs.

Now on to the episodes.  The very first scene is one of the best opening scenes I've seen.  Shin Asuka and his family are trying to evacuate the main island of Orb while a battle is going on around them.  A shell from one of the flying mobile suits explodes on top of Shin's family.  He survives because he gets back his sister's dropped cell phone. The scene definitly left an impression on me, in fact I was actually stunned for a moment (especially after seeing the results of the blast).

This sets up some great action sequences as Shin ends up becoming a soldier and helps with Zaft's new top secret Gundams.  After a couple of earth forces soldiers steals the new Gundams, Shin and a team of elite Zaft soldiers have to go after them.  On top of that, Orb's princess, Cagalli Ula Atha and the Zaft chairman, Dullindal (the English dub pronounce it Durindal) end up in the crosshairs.

The action is fierce and heavy along with some great dialogue in between, that makes gundam Seed Destiny look like its going to be a promising series.  The voice actors are great, i especially like Lunameria's English VA, she gives the character some added spunk.

I give the DVD 5 stars. The five episodes are almost nonstop action and has a super-speed pace that left my head spinning for a bit.

The box is great design, yet only has six slots I hope they won't stop at episode 30... so the box gets 4 stars.

The CD has great J-pop songs but only has 6 of the many that  included in the soundtrack (Gundam Seed Destiny Greatest Hits.  It gets 3 1/2 stars.

Over all I thought that Bandai did a great job in producing the english version of GSD, but because the box is a little suspect and the CD does not have a great amount of songs on it the grade is 4 stars.  Otherwise id give it a 5 star rating.",1143504000,,2360,4.197777777777778
8100624,5,B000CQQIB2,"Fans of the Gundam Seed series will be happy to know that the sequel to the popular series has finally made it arrival here in the US. First, a review of the actual anime:

1- This DVD contains the first five episodes and is quite frankly some of the best episodes of this series. The animation is nicely drawn, the colors are sharp, vivid, and the details is crisp and clean. The Japanese VA's sound perfect with the characters they portray, their emotions are conveyed very well and believable. The English dubbing, done by Ocean Group,  actually wasn't all that terrible. After listing to the amateur acting of the first season, I'm happy to report that the English VA's seem to have improved when portraying their respected characters. Grade A

2- The menu puts you in the pilot's seat of a mobile suit, allowing you to interact with various cockpit controls and panels, switching from the main menu to the extras. This seems typical of some of the previous Gundam series that's been released by Bandai in the past. The main menu features some nice video clips playing inside a display screen while music plays in the background. The only DVD extra is a textless opening video, which plays one of my favorite songs by TM Revolution. Grade A+

3- The main extra for this box set is the soundtrack CD which includes song sung by the six of the eight artists who did the opening and endings song for the series, T.M. Revolution, High and Mighty Color, Hitomi Takahashi, Chemistry, Nami Tamaki, Rie Fu. This is cool addition to have, unless you already own the CD. Grade A

4- Finally, the art box that comes included with the first volume, which is suppose to hold six standard DVD cases, is very cool in design. It can unfold completely and lie flat and magnets  hidden inside keeps the flaps in place when the box is folded up.

The artbox features some of the best artwork I've seen. With images of the Impulse and Chaos Gundam posing. The box itself is made from sturdy  card board, but tends to be flimsy when empty. Grade A.

Overall, this is an excellent start for a relatively decent series. Definitely worth spending extra just to get your hands on the artbox and the CD.",1142899200,3,2181,4.5717948717948715

First, the box folds out and will only hold 5 dvds.  And at 5 episodes a dvd, it will fill up half way thru the series.  Second is the CD.  While the Seed set came with the offical Gundam Seed Complete CD, this CD is just a collection of the opening and closing songs.  Its not even really labelled as a Gundam soundtrack and doesn't have any lyrics.
