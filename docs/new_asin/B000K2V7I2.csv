2682219,5,B000K2V7I2,"Synopsis: Ralph (Ross Finbow) is your classic, highly intelligent but socially awkward nerd just finishing his last day of work as a box boy at the local supermarket. His life hasn't been as happy as it could be, his parents are dead, he lives with his Grandmother and he's frequently harassed on the streets of Glasgow by a group of locals who have nothing better to do. It's only when alone in his bedroom that he finds solitude and escape from this mundane existence, for it is there that he becomes ""Game Master"" of his own realm.

Ralph's world is about to broaden for he has been granted a scholarship to the University of Scotland. Immediately upon arrival he expands his gaming skills with a new group of misfit fantasy addicts; Davy (Johnny Austin), Hank (Ross Sutherland) and the attractive, elfish Marlyn (Danielle Stewart). When Lennie (James Young), an old childhood acquaintance and adversary, is unexpectedly added to the groups on-going game the fun and fantasy take on more serious concerns.

`Gamerz' released in '06 is a marvelous and unexpectedly enchanting film. Who would have thought that a small budget Scottish production featuring a cast of young unknowns could deliver such a satisfying cinematic experience. Written and directed by Robbie Fraser (whoever that is), the film reaches far beyond the bounds of Scotland and touches upon universal themes and feelings that we can all relate to. I extend my congratulations to Mr. Fraser for a job well done. The production values are inventive (especially the fantasy, role-playing sequences) the cast believable and likeable and the Indie soundtrack is delightfully quirky. The only problem with this movie is the thick Scottish accent of some of the actors (James Young in particular) that make it difficult to understand. That may be a slight drawback, but it's also an integral part of the unique enduring ambience of the film.

This is a film that will definitely become a cult classic for those who have ever enjoyed fantasy role playing games. But make no mistake, this movie is also a captivating ""coming of age"" film that should attract a larger audience of ""non-nerds"" as well. Before the movies over you'll be so caught up in the fantasy you'll be asking the same question as gamer Davy, ""What is the difference between a Gnome and a Troll?""

8154152,3,B000K2V7I2,"This movie is confusing.  I thought it would be like so many other such movies: a comedy.  This is not a comedy.  I mean, it is a hilarious movie, but in the same way that The Young Poisoner's Handbook is hilarious.

I can definitely state that if you don't or didn't play D&D then it might not make a lot of sense.",1459555200,,315,4.032258064516129

8154154,1,B000K2V7I2,"UGH!!!!  This was, I thought, another take on the wonderful ""The Gamers, Darkness Rising..."" which was very funny!  THIS, is...UGH.....who wrote this tripe???",1384560000,,158,5.826086956521739
8154155,4,B000K2V7I2,"The Gamerz is entertaining. However, it does not compare to real legends like Journey Quest or Dorkness Rising. It is still a nice movie on roleplay - some of the Scottish may be difficult to understand",1349568000,,202,4.638888888888889
8154156,1,B000K2V7I2,"Were it not for the fact that I am on the page for the movie Gamerz, I would think that the other reviewers were watching a different movie than I was. The main character epitomizes the ""intelligent, socially awkward nerd"" to such an extreme, that it seems unrealistic. Take this into account with the fact that none of the other players are anywhere near the gamer stereotype, and it seems almost offensive. The female player is, to be blunt, insane. Then we have the jock who is only in it to get with the girl, which is real enough, I suppose, since that has happened to me, and some other non-entities.
As a gamer of D&D and Magic and all sorts of other nerdy things, I expect there to be a stereotype, which at times is slightly offensive; however, as time moves on, I find that the definition of ""nerd"" seems to be broadening to a not necessarily negative connotation. This move completely undoes the broadening view. By the end of it, *I* hated nerds.
This movie is less about a ""coming of age"" or ""life lessons"" then it is about a borderline schizophrenic becoming more and more psychotic. So yes, it provides an interesting insight to the mind of the brilliantly mad--but again, in such a ridiculously fake way, that it provides no benefit.
Personally, I was hoping the movie would focus more on the gamers playing the game and the plot they encounter (like ""The Gamers"") than some schizo-DM and his ""I'm an elf!"" love interest. I would like to point out to anyone unfortunate enough to watch this film that the percentage of pen and paper role playing gamers that are like those described in this film are in the vast minority (at least, they are in the US--I can't speak for Scotland).
Overall, the cinematography was admirable, sure, and the directing was effective, I guess, if that was the director's idea...but the plot is terrible, mildly offensive, and completely unrealistic to any standard of ""gamer"" that I have ever heard. The title should read more like ""In the Minds of a Psychotic....who happens to be a gamer....and some other crazy chick that thinks that she's an elf"".
I think I'm a worse person now for having watched this movie.",1271808000,2,2157,4.634464751958225
8154157,5,B000K2V7I2,"If you played D&D in the '80 (not the computer stuff of the 90's, but the REAL game) then you'll definitely love this movie. Killer DM's and nerds - with a cute elf thrown it.

The only down side to the movie is some jittery camera work from time to time - not sure what that was about. I was afraid it was going to be very cheesy, but it had me laughing as well as a couple ""wow, I didn't see that coming"" moments. On the whole - very cool movie.",1198281600,4,447,3.858695652173913
8154158,4,B000K2V7I2,This may not appeal to a wide audience but to anyone who is into role playing games (Dungeons and Dragons) will love this movie.  I bought it for my son (17) and he loves it.,1195344000,2,174,3.9714285714285715
8154159,4,B000K2V7I2,"I picked this off the shelf at Blockbuster expecting it to be a ""mockumentary"" similar to ones that seem to be surfacing more frequently now. I was surprised to find out, not only was this a serious film, but it was filmed in Scotland (guess it helps if you read the box?!?)

The previous reviewer was right about the think accents (I am lucky my wife does not have as difficult a time as I do and will translate) but I was able to make out most of the dialog after acclimating myself to it a short way in. At times it was predictable and seemed to drag, but the climax was sastisfactory enough and not exactly what I expected.

The production was much better than I estimated for a film of this genre, although nothing exactly wowed me neither was I laughing at cheesy CGI effects better left to the viewer's imagination. The dialog my brian allowed me to make out was well written and delivered convincingly.

Ross Finbow and Jame Young both did a superb job with their roles. The writer/director, Robbie Fraser, has crafted an impressive film. I look forward to seeing more from him with broader appeal.",1178236800,4,1106,4.492537313432836
8154160,5,B000K2V7I2,"Found this title at Blockbuster and was happily taken aback by this comedy from Scotland. Quirky lead character is a classic role-playing fan, and has a face that could be seen in dungeons and castles of the middle ages, yet surprisingly sincere and charismatic acting. For a small film, has surprisingly cool special effects - a rotoscoping technique they developed - that comes into play every time the characters delve into the role-playing world. Know this since the DVD has some extra features on the making of the film. Also, some funny deleted scenes. Definite recommend.",1174348800,4,578,5.03125
