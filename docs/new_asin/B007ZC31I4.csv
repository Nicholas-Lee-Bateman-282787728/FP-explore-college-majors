8526979,4,B007ZC31I4,"the trailer hooked me in so I decided to check out the film and was very surprised to see how much I enjoyed it! For some reason IMDB users give this film a terrible rating? I don't understand why? In my opinion, it was a good balance between genre (enough to get me to watch it) and art cinema...but not boring art cinema! the scene with mickey talking about, ""me and ed were pinned down..."" that bit should be somewhere in film history...honestly. My only notes would be this: the third act doesn't really bring resolution to the characters as much as it should and some of the scenes in the second act seemed as though they weren't pushing anything forward (but I guess the film was already too short to cut). lastly, I wish there would have been a stronger driving motivation for the character mickey and why he had to steal that money.

but overall...great freakin job to the folks who made this. Can't wait to see more this director.",1391644800,4,939,4.459302325581396
8526980,5,B007ZC31I4,"This is the first feature-length directorial effort of a talented filmmaker, and based on this impressive debut, I look forward to seeing more. This movie is not spectacle-porn, like so many of the gargantuan budget super-hero epics trotted out for mass consumption, but a personal and honest portrayal of male friendship, wrapped up in a tale of palpable mortal danger. If you appreciate and understand true filmmaking, I recommend this gem from a director who obviously understands it too.",1362700800,3,491,5.227848101265823
