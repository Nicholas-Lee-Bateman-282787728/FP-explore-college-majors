7833953,5,6302995825,"Why this great film hasn't been transferred to DVD is a mystery. I remember it vividly from its initial release.

Wonderful period picture based on Bernard Malamud's bestselling book. Alan Bates is great as always. Smart, savvy script, beautiful sets, brilliant direction & cinematography. What more could you ask?

Only reason I can think of is it's just too intelligent for today's dumbed-down audience.",1505347200,,405,5.3125
7833954,4,6302995825,An excellent performance by Alan Bates in what is a message movie. The message could have been delivered better with more subtlety in my opinion.,1463356800,,145,4.84

7833956,4,6302995825,"It's really sad that there is no official studio release of 1968's ""The Fixer,"" based upon the novel by Bernard Malamud. This DVD is from Spain and has been retitled ""El Hombre de Kiev"". The DVD appears to use an old video as its source, so that the picture is not very crisp, and there is color bleeding and fading as well. It's also non-widescreen, despite claims to the contrary. Even so, the fine performances from an ensemble cast manage to shine through. Alan Bates stars, in an Oscar-nominated role, as Yakov Bok, a Jew in Kiev during the second decade of the 20th Century in Czarist Russia. First, he is falsely accused of rape, and then framed for the ritual murder of a young Christian boy. He undergoes continual tortures and humiliations in hopes of gaining a false confession. It soon becomes apparent that Jews in general and Yakov specifically are being scapegoated by the government to take attention away from the unpopular czar and those running the government. Parallels are intentionally drawn between the abuse suffered by Yakov, a ""fixer"" or someone who fixes things with his hands, and Jesus, the carpenter.

The movie is sensitively directed by John Frankenheimer and includes many other fine actors who are no longer with us: Dirk Bogarde as a sympathetic magistrate; Georgia Brown, as the slovenly mother of the dead child; Hugh Griffith, as a wealthy anti-Semite who unknowingly takes Yakov into his home; Elizabeth Hartman as Griffith's daughter, who attempts to seduce Yakov; Carol White as Yakov's wife; and David Opatashu, Peter Jeffrey, George Murcell, and Mike Pratt in smaller roles. Among those still living today are Ian Holm as a corrupt official attempting to secure a confession, David Warner as an evil Russian prince who wants to have Yakov eliminated, and Murray Melvin as a nutty priest (what else?). The film script was by Dalton Trumbo, who knew about suffering first-hand as one of the blacklisted Hollywood writers of the early 1950s.",1333584000,,1981,4.948948948948949
7833957,5,6302995825,"Set in Tsarist Russia, the film focuses on one individuals (Alan Bates) suffering, who, falsely accused of an horrific crime is imprisoned and persecuted not only for a crime he would not confess to, but for being a Jew. Denied natural justice his only ally, a lawyer,(Dirk Bogarde) is eliminated. Eventually, his imprisonment draws the attention of the international community which calls for his release. Embarrassed, the Tzar offers him a pardon, but he refuses the pardon and demands a trial which infuriates the authorities even further.
The film is an allegory to the plight of Jewry at that time and is the forerunner to the horrors of the 'Shoa' during WW11. This film should be required viewing for everyone.",1302825600,,717,4.983333333333333
7833958,5,6302995825,"I saw ""The Fixer"" in a theater when it was first released.  That was at least 40 years ago, and I have never forgotten the powerful and moving performance by Alan Bates.  I am dismayed that it has not been released in DVD format. The world is missing a masterpiece.",1279584000,,265,4.28
7833959,5,6302995825,when this film came out in the theaters I went to see it 10 times.  Everyone I took to see it was horrified and did not understand why I liked it.  It is powerful and moving. I so hoped Bates would win the Academy Award.  I hope this will come out on DVD soon as well as other of Bates films that are only on VHS.,1217030400,,313,3.712121212121212
7833960,5,6302995825,"If the term ""entireness"" adjusts itself to just a few North American filmmakers, then, John Frankenheimer should be included in this reduced catalogue.

This is a deeply moving drama about anti-Semitism in tsarist Russia around 1911.  A Russian Jewish peasant (the formidable Alan Bates) is wrongly imprisoned for a unlikely crime - on the fragile humanity of a gentle child in Kiev. Bogarde plays the role of a very sympathetic tsarist defense attorney. Based on a true story on Bernard Malamud's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel, the movie is at certain passages unrelenting but at the end will reward you. Because to get such level of direction, plues the presence of two giants actors as Bogarde and Bates is -certainly- hard to find in those days.

A must- see.",1192665600,,762,4.984251968503937
