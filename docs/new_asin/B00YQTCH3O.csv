8718839,3,B00YQTCH3O,"Firefighter hero tracks down a serial killer. This film is standard thriller fare. Theres a murder in the first minute of the film, and then the action comes to a dead stop. Slow-paced until mid-way through the film when the action and the interest picks up to make the film interesting enough to watch.",1512259200,,303,4.62962962962963

8718843,4,B00YQTCH3O,"I bought this DVD so many years ago, I can't remember from who.  However  I do own a standard DVD.  This is a very quirky film which requires one to just let the brain slog along in low gear  but still pay attention to the road.  Kevin Kline is the reluctant hero who has some special skills, and friends just as quirky as his lifestyle (Alan Rickman) and a wife who totally just doesn't get it (Susan Sarandon).  But some of his old co-workers and even some reluctant not-so-co-workers think he's the man who might be able to find the solution to their serial killer problem.  Sorry; no spoilers.  I liked this film just because it was very different and the actors made their characters believable, regardless of their foibles and/or dislike of one another.  It's a tension filled story that keeps you guessing  and wondering just what kind of situation will arise next.  A round of applause for the cast, which make the whole thing believable, bearable and filled with fun at least as funny as murder can get.  Try it  you'll like it!",1445299200,3,1037,4.54054054054054
