8533689,5,B00913ZKGQ,"DVDs like this are the next best thing to actually being in a class. I commend Amazon for marketing the likes of Howard, Bisio, Clear, Gullette, Mancuso and Painter, all of whom I highly recommend for divergent methods of studying Ba Gua Zhang. Each Master shares his skills with the audience with emphasis on ""principles"" in form and application; therefore, much of the instruction is related and overlaps in a positive way.  Most, like Howard, offer written material as a supplement and companion to their videos.",1380758400,,515,4.988372093023256
