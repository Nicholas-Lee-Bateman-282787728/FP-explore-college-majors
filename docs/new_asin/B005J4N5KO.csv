8475381,2,B005J4N5KO,"This is the most openly propagandist bulls*** I have ever watched. There is no context - no the fact these shooters were all in a war where there was a draft where you actually had to not be stupid and fat to qualify to go to the jungle. This is the show the government needs you to watch show if you're a) stupid: you volunteer! b) You're poor and think you'll get out before you see action, you get college!; c) You;re a or b and die for something the government won't tell you about, but are willing to let you die for.",1424649600,,522,4.077669902912621
