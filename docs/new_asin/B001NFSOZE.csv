8344381,4,B001NFSOZE,"This is a wonderful movie, sadly ignored by the audience. The movie is so thrilling towards the end, and the climax is a shock. The movie is about dj vu, a feeling of experiencing something that seems to be experienced earlier. It is really interesting, I watched the movie without any hope, and loved it. The performances are good, and there is a good chemistry between the lead couple. The title song is also very good. The movie drags somewhere in the second hour, but things go to the peak towards the ending. Also, there are several thrilling moments in the movie. Such movies should be promoted, instead of being dragged through the mud.",1301529600,,643,4.649122807017544
