In fact, I have purchased five copies to give as gifts to friends and even a skeptic friend of my wife.  The host/author of the DVD did an approach to the Shroud of Turin, raising the questions that most people would raise in determining the authenticity of the Shroud.  My interest in the issue over the Shroud goes back many years.  Dr. Chuck Missler had a video clip on one of his programs a decade ago, and had as a guest Isabel Piczek and she gave an incredible analysis that compliments the presentation by the host Russ Breault.  Dr. Piczek died in September of  2016 if I recall, but to the point.  Her field of profession dealt with religious artwork and more important she was a particle physicist.  Dr. Piczek revealed, from my understanding of her report, Jesus' body levitated during the resurrection event.  This might be expressed differently, its not my forte, however her presentation added much to the molecular changes that occurred.

Mr. Breault's video is an excellent presentation for the unbeliever and believer concerning the secrets of the Shroud of Turin.  He offers the Biblical explanation for the reason of the Shroud.  If you get the DVD, be aware that it contains a second part beside the main presentation DVD that runs an hour and ten minutes.  Everyone I gave a copy to forgot to or overlooked to watch the second half.  Mr. Breault offers seven proofs for the Shroud of Turin.  This DVD was produced as a teaching lesson by Cutting Edge Ministries.  This DVD would be an asset to any pastor, lay person, Sunday School library, church school.

Mr. Breault also did a half hour interview program with Isabel Piczek, mentioned above, accessible on the internet as a You Tube on why the Shroud cannot be a painting.  Ms. Piczek was an expert, an authority on paintings, art work, and adds additional professional expertise that corroborates the credibility of the Burial Shroud of Turin as the burial garments of Jesus Christ.  I expect to buy more copies to share in the future.  It is an excellent buy!

8747465,5,B01AIEI71Q,"This video is presented in a lecture style which I liked.  A lot of information was passed on in a relatively short time.  The material
is based on the Bible and the presenter is obviously very well versed in the Bible and is very knowledgeable about The Shroud of Turin as well.
I found the DVD to be persuasive that it is highly probable that The Shroud it's the actual burial cloth of Jesus. I am a committed Christian but I think that even a skeptic who viewed this DVD would have to acknowledge that the evidence put forth was well done and compelling.",1456704000,7,557,4.346153846153846
