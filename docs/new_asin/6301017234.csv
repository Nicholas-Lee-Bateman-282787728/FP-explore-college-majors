7809075,2,6301017234,Gives more detail of the story.  Better ending and more thought out.  Acting was also much better.  Although there were three parts to the 2012 version you could appreciate the story better.,1394409600,,190,4.875
7809076,5,6301017234,"Have loved this movie from the moment I first saw it over 20 years ago!  I looked for it everywhere but could never find it-thank you Amazon!  This movie portrays more of the romance between Johnse and Rosanna and focuses a little less on the feud, and also shows a little of our poor some of these families were and how proud!",1382486400,,327,4.258064516129032

7809079,3,6301017234,"I snapped up a used copy of this movie at the local flea market and couldn't wait to watch it.  Having bought, viewed and enjoyed Sounder, Where the Lilies Bloom, Dollmaker, etc. I was eager to add this Southern drama to my collection.  However, it paled in comparison to these classics. I was lost within the first 8 minutes of the film, but it really didn't matter due to the poor script, poor acting, poor score and poor cinematography. I really hoped for more but was sadly disappointed.",1023148800,4,491,4.568181818181818
7809080,2,6301017234,"Although there is some good characterizations of the leaders of both families, the film doesn't really tell the truth of what happened. As the 3x great grandson of Randall McCoy (played by Steve Forrest) I hope a movie  will one day come out that shows the feud in an accurate way.",944092800,4,281,4.509803921568627
