5531828,5,B00AZMFO0E,"I looked for this film to hit the theaters but had a difficult time finding it.  We found it in a small theater near OSU campus in Columbus, Ohio.  I rarely buy movies, but this is a keeper.  A rare and completely breathtaking video of the disappearing glaciers on the planet.  The ice will be gone, and it's documented in this film leaving.  We'll never see the ice like this again in our lifetime.  Waiting for this movie to become available so I can show it to friends and family.  I'll buy a few copies.",1360627200,24,507,4.273684210526316
5531829,5,B00AZMFO0E,"We just saw this at our local film festival.  While it should be seen on a big screen with great sound, if you like real stories with purpose and beauty, do not miss this one.  We own fewer than 10 DVDs. This is one worth owning. This is the history of our time.",1360368000,31,262,3.9245283018867925
5531830,5,B00AZMFO0E,"In 2007 James Balog started a multi-year initiative called ""Extre Ice Survey"" (or EIS), targeting glaciers in Iceland, Greenland and Alaska where he placed about two dozen cameras to document what is happening to glaciers around the world. Director Jeff Orlowski and his team tagged along and the results of this were captured in a documentary called ""Chasing Ice"". It played very briefly here in SW Ohio a few months back and I missed it but I finally had a chance to see it last month at the West End Cinema in Washington DC.

""Chasing Ice"" (2012 release; 76 min.) feels like a National Geogprahic special, and this is not a surprise (nor a complaint) in that James Balog started a pre-EIS project in partnership with National Geographic. Once it became clear to Balog that this could be something very special, the project was expanded into what would become the EIS. This movie was shot over a period of almost 4 years, and the patience with which this movie came about really pays off. If you think this is some one-man show, you will be surprised to see how many people became involved with this, and what the techological challenges were and how they would need to overcome (the most obvious one being: how to shelter the cameras from the relentless weather elements). Once the cameras are positioned, they were to make photographs every 30 min. during the daylight hours. When you collect the thousands of pictures into a time-lapse film, the results are nothing short of astonishing. In addition to the time-lapse photography, there is various video footage as well. Sometimes you need to be a little lucky, as when a team goes out in the hope of catching the ""calving"" of a glacier (when a huge piece breaks off), and then actually catches it on camera (the concluding part of the movie is primarily the jaw-dropping footage of a ""calving"" the size of lower Manhattan from a glacier in Greenland).

In all, I can't say enough about this movie. I was initially a bit skeptical of going to see this due to the rather short running time, but all I can say is that I am very glad I went anyway, as this movie will without a doubt blow your mind, as it did mine. If you have a chance to see this, either in the theatre or on DVD, do not miss it. ""Chasing Ice"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1358726400,68,2295,4.567961165048544

5531961,2,B00AZMFO0E,"The two stars in this review come from the very end of the movie, where the results are finally provided, after having to endure watching this narcissist in his mission to stop climate change. No, this two star review has nothing to do with me trying to deny climate change. In fact, this review is my disgust in how somebody could take data/imagery with so much potential and turn it into a movie of self promotion. This documentary did not need a protagonist, and instead needed a narrator in the style of Frozen Planet. Both my 8 year old and 4 year daughters expressed after this film that they did not 'get it', and wondered why they had to show that 'guy so much'. Keeping on the Frozen Planet theme, the creators of this film could have milked two movies from this by making one centered on results, and another on the methods.

That stated, as somebody versed in climbing techniques, I was horrified to see how good equipment was being abused, nor did I see the point in the need for the protagonist to get those shots of a water running into a moulin. But how about we just state for the sake of eye candy that the shot was needed. Ask yourself the question of why somebody with bad knees and an obvious serious lack of climbing skills would lower themselves into that position with no ascenders and belay retrieval system? Perhaps consulting somebody with background in getting such shots would reveal that arborists have been employing descending/ascending systems for years that would have allowed him to lower himself with ease into that hole, and not even have a high element of danger in coming back out with an ascender system. But that's not the point here - the point is that I'm supposed to walk away feeling like this man will go to any extreme to prove that climate change is occurring. Again - I'm fully aware of climate change and support every endeavor to mitigate its abruptness, but I continue to wonder why I needed to waste 20 minutes of my life painfully watching people mulling around the edge of a moulin - which does occur quite naturally on glacier surfaces. That time could have been spent in narration explaining how these are natural features, but the magnitude and size of them are increasing a a rapid pace.

I will conclude with my opening in that the time lapse imagery at the end is worth fast forwarding to the end, just to witness that footage. My hope is somebody will take this data/imagery and apply a proper amount of scientific knowledge and background to it in a narrated film so this footage gets the rating it deserves.",1458259200,3,2570,4.572668112798264

After a long introduction explaining the importance of obtaining documentary time lapse evidence of retreating glaciers, we are treated not to the evidence but to a long movie about how to make the movie that we don't in fact get to see.  When Chasing Ice started showing the moviemakers taking photographs of themselves making some other movie about climbing down to a stream in the ice, I almost gave up.  Towards the end there is a bit time of lapse photography of a receding glacier but it's very jerky.
If I'd understood at the outset that this movie was going to be about some guys with very expensive equipment, (helicopters and planes for the true wilderness experience,) wandering around in Greenland talking about aching knees, I might have given it five stars.",1426377600,4,802,4.882352941176471

5532117,5,B00AZMFO0E,"""Chasing Ice"" is a visually stunning and important documentary which won an Emmy in 2014. James Balog, an acclaimed nature photographer, founded EIS (Extreme Ice Survey) in 2007 to capture visually the extraordinary and relentless shrinkage of the glaciers in Iceland, Greenland, Alaska and Montana. The film covers the technical challenge of building time lapse photography systems able to endure severe weather as well as the human challenge of installing them on site. Though equipment failures plagued the first installations, those issues were eventually overcome and the team was able to recover memory cards with thousands of digital images from each camera. When strung together in time lapse videos, the evidence of dramatic collapse of the glaciers is incontrovertible.

The documentary also covers the challenges of visiting the ice fields and demonstrates the dangers that each of the team members were subjected to. We also get some more personal background info on Balog, including interviews with his wife and daughter, as well as his knee surgery and stubborn refusal to allow his physical limitations to slow down the project.

The film is also laced with interviews with various PhD's discussing climate change and global warming, as well as news stories of people continuing to deny global warming.

Don't quit when you get to the credits though - the most stunning images are displayed during the very extensive credits accompanied by a wonderful sound track sung by Scarlet Johannsen.

5532203,4,B00AZMFO0E,"Well, opinions seem fixed on environmental issues, more by one's political views than by science.  I'm not sure if any one film can convince a skeptic that the world's climate is rather rapidly changing and that mankind's actions are to blame, but this short documentary might be helpful since, as the saying goes, ""a picture is worth a thousand words"".  As others have explained, Balog spent a lot of time and money to do this project, which had never really been done before.  Yes we have satellite images which can show large-scale changes in ice, deforestation, volcanic eruption and many other things.  But they don't have the same, on-the-ground view as these cameras.  It took some fancy work to make the cameras work: taking pictures something like once per hour, the cameras had to be reliable despite hurricane-force winds and temperatures as low as 40 below zero F.  Twenty four cameras in all were deployed (all in the northern hemisphere) 2 in Montana (Glacier National Park), the remainder in Alaska, Greenland and Iceland.  Photos were taken over 4 years, and the result shows the dramatic shrinkage of most glaciers--sometimes clear off the prior frame which they dominated...
Together with some brief explanation of how ice-core sampling works to determine annual temperatures and carbon dioxide levels, the film is yet another example of why virtually all scientists who have studied climatology have concluded that mankind is ""baking into the cake"" some major future warming--the early effects of which are already being seen.  The film makes no attempt to discuss alternatives, but portrays for those who doubt, the reality of ice melting at rapid rates into the oceans.  It was unexpectedly combined with a bit of a personal story for Balog, who underwent knee surgery partway through the project, is advised to stop hiking, and continues to do so anyhow to finish the documentary (with painful results).
 Paleologists say the earth has been through 3 mass extinctions in the past-presumably caused by impacts by large asteroids or comets; maybe by unusually bad volcanic activity.  Anyhow, now many scientists are warning of a 4th mass extinction, in the ""Anthropocene"" era--a mass extinction of species caused by rapid global warming, caused in turn by rapid increase in CO2 levels and some other potent, man-made ""greenhouse gasses"".
As I say, the film itself is fairly short and has some really beautiful scenes of ice.  I recommend watching it, whether or not you are a skeptic about global warming.",1412380800,2,2525,5.087167070217918

Chasing Ice shows wonderful images of glaciers, but also shows how big pieces of ice are melting and crashing into seas. This movie gives visual evidence of climate change.

5532532,4,B00AZMFO0E,"While many people still find hard to believe that global warming and its catastrophic impacts are real,  ""Chasing Ice"" shows a graphic and ugly truth about how climate shift events have affected our glaciers.
  In this documentary by Jeff Orlowski, we get to see the ultimate glacier experience of James Balog and his project ""Extreme Ice survey"". Balog and his team set up a total of 24 cameras in Iceland, Greenland, Alaska and Montana. The main idea was to have those 24 cameras shooting pictures every hour during a six-month period, but a few setbacks got them started off on the wrong foot. The troubleshooting started and the many little problems got fixed. The team came back to check on the cameras again and this time was a success.
 It was amazing to see how the time lapsed videos, with photos collected since 2007, showed one of the glaciers recede several hundred feet per year. It may be hard to comprehend but global warming is real and is happening now. One of the goals for Balog with this movie is to show the public believable and understandable pieces of evidence. And indeed what we see is on Balog's time lapsed videos are powerful pieces of history unfolding in front of us. With a little bit of unnecessary drama, Balog undergoes a few knee surgeries, and also his family man side was shown. After all, every single effort is directed towards his family and to try to improve the chances of future sustainability for them.

 One of the strengths of the film was to show the public in fewer words and more images, the explicit truth that the glaciers are facing. And even though the time lapsed video was shown and makes a great impact on the viewers, I still believe that more of the consequences needed to be shown to the public as a warning sign of what future may bring us.

5532578,5,B00AZMFO0E,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Nature photographer James Balog had an idea; What if he set up cameras around the world to `watch' glaciers? After a National Geographic story, in which he did the images of climate changes, he was converted to believing something was going on in Earth's atmosphere - and man was behind it. Like many, At first he was of the mind set that nature ebbs and flows and always has. But, in the past 100 years, post Industrial Revolution, the C02 levels man has exhaled out via machine, oil and livestock, has added a devastating amount of C02. But, how to share this epiphany when he himself had shrugged it off?

Show the changes. Use pretty visuals. Use the camera.

A special team called Extreme Ice Survey (EIS) gathered and went about sealing time lapse cameras and figuring out where to watch. Then months and months of planning lead to broken cameras and destroyed footage (fox and birds do odd things to devices they come across in their habitat).

More determined then ever, the team regrouped and tried again.

The result is a few brief-in-history years of activity captured; the movements then streamed together - unaltered - to show the quiet catastrophes we can not afford to ignore. These icebergs are melting quickly and dramatically.

Through pretty images the team is able to show mankind, in a way that may get through, what is going on in remote landscapes that eventually effect them. And the footage clearly tells of the Ghost of Christmas future - and he's gonna be wearing an oxygen mask and paying $100 for a glass of clean water that the never relenting sun bakes freely because there is not Ozone protecting the creatures below...just saying.

The most beautiful and disturbing images are those of great calvings. Calving is the act of glaciers breaking off a chunk into the sea. Today, those pieces are fifteen football fields long. The graphs from climatologists and geologists show the changes in all the data. But, in Chasing Ice, the human brain, through gorgeous artful architectural images, is able to comprehend the insidious reality.

They even show the graph of those pesky ""new"" glaciers debaters argue as debunking pontification. But, when they show you in perspective it is jaw-dropping; 200 to something like 40,000 destroyed.

Through this years-long look at desolate places man effects without meaning to, perhaps, the facts will strike a deep chord for change. Here is the artful way to reach the naysayer. Even if you just watch for the beautiful pictures, you will wonder, ""Why wouldn't we all err on the side of the planet?""

So you will find the Instant version, the DVD and the Bluray combined. You should check carefully to see which format the reviewer is discussing.

That said, this is a review of the ""Special edition"" Bluray and I hope I can add more details not previously provided.

First let me say that I love this 75-minute film! The images are gorgeous and look superb on my new flat screen TV. The story is also important too. You can watch this film on various levels: As a gorgeous photo-essay of nature's wonders, as one-man's journey to capture this beauty before it disappears and as a warning that these natural beauties are disappearing faster than we thought. And, heck, if you want to demonstrate the quality of your new flat screen TV for your friends, you can do that too!

As I said, the film is only 75 minutes in length but the ""Special edition"" comes with lots of bonuses. In addition to the Director's Commentary, there is an hour of featurettes like a Q&A at a film festival, A ""making of"" featurette, and how the time-lapses were done. There's also a 40-page booklet included which contains three pages of text and the rest are filled with photo images which are great - though (of course) much smaller than the ones on your TV screen.

Having been to Iceland (this year) and Alaska (twice) the images brought back fond memories. But this is a must see for any nature lover as well as anyone who found Jon Krakaur's book ""Into The Wild"" interesting.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Is it any mystery that many Americans are confused when it comes to Climate Change?

If you don't do one other thing to try to figure out what is going on with our climate, watch this film!

James Balog is trained as a physical scientist, but instead pursued a career as a photographer, including the National Geographic Society.  Some years ago he gained an interest in ice as a subject for photography, and when he visited glaciers around the world started to notice significant changes there.  He then established ""The Extreme Ice Survey"", a small organization whose goal is to set up time lapse cameras to document changes in glaciers in Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, and Montana.  This documentary chronicles the efforts of this group and shows the time lapse changes in glaciers over a 2-3 year period.

If you ever needed a piece of visual evidence that climate is changing, this is it.  Put aside the science, put aside the politicization of the topic, and watch the film.

It's enough to make me want to weep!  Though I am already well aware of the ongoing accumulation of scientific evidence regarding climate change, I still sat there with my jaw dropped as I watched the results of Balog's work.

Maybe a longer time lapse of the same places would show the same thing but it also could show a lesser effect of the climate. The places that were analyzed were all concentrated in the Northern hemisphere and on the Occident. There are plenty of glaciers around the world that could have been explored.

5532640,5,B00AZMFO0E,"Chasing Ice (Jeff Orlowski, 2012)

Towards the end of this movie, there is an interview with a former Shell employee who, upon being exposed to James Balog's work, quit his job spin doctoring for Big Oil and went to work for the dark side. I do not know this for certain, but I am going to take an educated guess that that particular interview has been savaged by the so-called conservatives who attack the science of climate change on a regular basis. (The reason I say ""so-called conservatives"" is beyond the scope of this review, but to oversimplify, ""orthodox religious"" and ""conservative"" are mutually exclusive terms; it is impossible to base your arguments solely on reason when your thinking is driven by faith, which is by definition the antithesis of reason.) I am here to tell you that yes, it is possible.

I was not a believer in climate change. One of my favorite stories comes from an ex-Navy friend of mine who used to pilot submarines. (Tough living, huh?) In the early nineties, he and his crew hosted Al Gore, and they took him on a cruise up around the coast of Alaska. He came back the next year, so said friend tells me, and wanted to take that same trip so he could gauge the effects of climate change on the glaciers. We always had quite a laugh at that one. Well, more fool us, because here comes James Balog with photographic evidence of the amount of loss a number of major glaciers in America and western Europe have undergone over a four-year period from 2007 to 2011. And it's the simplest play in the book: seeing is believing. To put this in the kindest terms I can think of: if you come away from this movie doubting climate change, you have your head somewhere that the light can't reach it. A thousand hyperboles from activist types who have a little schooling in marketing can't compare to watching time-lapse photography of two and a half miles of a glacier retreating in four years' time.

There is, of course, a lot of personal stuff all wrapped up in this; it is as much a documentary about Balog as it is about the EIS, and Orlowski makes some great parallels between glaciers and James Balog's knee. (I don't mean that sarcastically, it's understated and quite inventive.) There were times when I thought the movie focused too much on the people and not enough on its stated subject, though they were brief and always tied back in to the movie's subject matter (for example, the two guys babysitting the glacier in the last quarter of the movie; it looks like filler until the scene where Orlowski reveals why he kept all that footage in).

Put simply: this is a life-changing film. It is not so much a documentary as it is an experience. This is important filmmaking, and it is made all the more important because, like his subject, at no point does Orlowski allow his message to get in the way of the artistry of his presentation; the entire film is beautifully shot, with Orlowski doing all sorts of little things to play up the differences between his indoor and outdoor shots (and taking into account the personalities of the subjects onscreen at the time; the indoor shots with Balog's family are much more comfortable than the indoor shots with Balog himself, who would always rather be outdoors, for example), spending time lingering on beautiful ice shots, etc. It is as much a feast for the eyes as it is food for the brain, and it is a movie you need to see, preferably at your earliest convenience. Do not let this one get away. **** ",1377734400,16,3488,4.565495207667731

What most people don't understand or even follow is how this is affecting our planet and daily lives because it's so remote and far away. The glaciers are made of ice.... ice reflects the sun, which in turn keeps the earth's temperature's regulated. Like a human's pituitary gland which keeps our body temp regulated. When that doesn't work well, our body temp can be severely affected.  With the ice melting and glaciers retreating by miles every year, the sun is then absorbed into the dark ocean and the exposed land. the more heat that is absorbed by oceans and land, the higher the planet's temperature rises, which is why we're seeing these extreme weather patterns of heat waves, fires, hurricanes, droughts, etc... because the glaciers are melting revealing more land and ocean, which means the sun is essentially baking the planet. Without these massive ice sheets, which are melting and retreating at record speeds, the earth will continue to heat up and severe weather worldwide will increase. The increase in the last hundred years far exceeds all normal ebbs and flows of weather patterns seen in earth's history. Why does this matter to you in Kansas, RI, Montana, Canada, Europe, wherever... it matters because the entire planet is affected which means every human being and life form on Earth is affected by having fewer resources. Mass extinctions of many species has already begun. This is not something happening in the future, this is happening now, and from the research I've followed for the past 20 years, it is now irreversible no matter how many electric vehicles we buy or how much we recycle. It's too little too late. We use oil for everything from powering cars to building buildings to making make-up to manufacturing children's toys to powering our power to shipping and distributing it all of it to every store in the world via plane, train and ship, all of which use oil. In fact, there's almost nothing left that doesn't require use of oil. So yes we are addicted to oil and as long as oil is used for everything we use in life, we as a species will continue to pump excessive amounts of CO2 into the air which contributes to the green house gasses that are speeding up global warming.

The science makes for interesting brain food and Balog's personal journey is unique, if a bit overplayed, but the real show-stoppers are his long-form time lapses and breath-stealing snapshots of nature at its most profound. The centerpiece of this film, and of his argument, are a series of three-year-long panoramas in which we clearly watch several glaciers shrink and recede at an alarming rate; a convincing testament to both the presence and speed of the global melt.

As a photographer with over 30 years experience, I would so love to have an opportunity to go to these places and shoot some of these images for myself.  The visual splendor is nothing short of amazing for both the time-lapse and the live video, and it's well worth seeing just for the visuals.

For climate change skeptics, there are two excellent points in the film.  The first is that the photographer himself, James Balog, was skeptical.  He trained in geology and didn't see how man-made changes could affect the huge machine that the planet is.  He changed his mind.  The second is a Canadian Yukon glacier scientist.  They've been studying glaciers in the Yukon for something on the order of 150 years.  He admits that four glaciers have actually grown over the last 50 years, but half of the remaining have disappeared entirely and the other half have shrunk.

But if this movie doesn't make you re-evaluate your stand that global climate change is not real, then I think you're probably a lost cause.

A very sobering, very beautiful film.  I can't wait for it to release on September 10.",1366416000,22,1195,4.6650717703349285
5532690,5,B00AZMFO0E,Just saw this at an environmental film festival and it was amazing!  The photography is amazing and I left feeling that I really must do something to make a difference with global warming.  I will be buying when it comes out!,1363996800,2,225,4.463414634146342
5532691,5,B00AZMFO0E,"Riveting story and beautifully filmed. There's a reason it won best cinematography at Sundance! If you were inspired by the book, check out the companion bookICE: Portraits of Vanishing Glaciers. Again, you won't be disappointed.",1362355200,8,229,5.571428571428571

8559786,5,B00AZMFO0E,Excellent movie showing climate change impact without the science.  Balog uses time lapse photography to great effect and tells the story  of human impact on the environment well.  Hard to deny the changes.,1521763200,,206,5.181818181818182
8559787,5,B00AZMFO0E,"Great cinematography, provided information we all need to know, because we can all do something individually and collectively to change the harm that is happening.  Both in what we do and in how we act = by calling politicians and telling them what we want them to do to protect OUR environment.  Amazing work and at great sacrifice from those who did the film.  Thank you.  A must watch for all, especially in schools!",1520380800,,419,4.621621621621622

8559790,4,B00AZMFO0E,"Eye-popping cinematography by a courageous and dedicated photographer.  It's is one of my research pieces on glaciers for my next novel, ""Melt-Out"".  However, Mr. Balog is selling anthropological climate change, not science.  He carefully omits any ideas about the cyclical nature of glacier flow, and instead tries to build a rather one-sided case that glacier flows, once triggered, are unstoppable and apocalyptic.  WAtch the documentary and then do your own research on glaciology.",1515628800,,485,5.602739726027397
