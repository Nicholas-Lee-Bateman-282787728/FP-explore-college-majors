812310,5,6304237707,"If you haven't seen ""Duck"", you have no idea what a treat you've missed. This way-ahead-of-its-time, outrageous black comedy has held up amazingly well, despite it being made 35 years ago.
Tuesday Weld (in what is arguably her best performance) plays an ""Everygirl"" with a somewhat mercenary edge, Roddy McDowell plays her best friend who will do anything to please her-ANYTHING.
The action centers around Consolidated High School in Los Angeles, a school so ""progressive"" botany is called ""Plant Skills""; and where the only way Tuesday Weld can be accepted by the popular girls is by joining something called the ""Cashmere Sweater Club""
The movie skewers the youth culture, Southern California, sexuality, teen romance, public education, so effectively and hilariously you would think it was made yesterday. My favorite line: ""Honey, in this family, we don't divorce our men, we bury them"".",1001548800,14,891,5.28169014084507
812311,4,6304237707,"First time I saw this I could hardly believe the many, many visible boom mikes throughout the film. Loved the picture regardless, and now I've come to accept those boom mikes as characters as central to LORD LOVE A DUCK's frazzled beauty as Roddy McDowall & Tuesday Weld, its stars. Most knowledgeable film fans hold 70s films in reverence for their embracing of a deeper, richer reality more inspired by novels than by prior Hollywood films. 60s cinema tends to suffer by comparison: it often seems like a clumsy standoff between the death-throes of the old studios and their formulas, and the insisting beating on the door of a new, artistic, more experimental aesthetic: DUCK is one of those, subverting the soundstage-bound Mickey & Judy cliches by emulating that shot-on-indoor-sets look, with the vital modification of peopling this familiar artifical environment with the hyperAmerican grotesques who routinely populate Geo Axelrod's universe. Thus, like a lot of the best 60s movies, DUCK is part-fish, part-fowl and suffused with an atmosphere of strangeness beyond its subject matter - yet, given how Real Life in that decade similarly swayed on unsteady footing in two seperate realities, it works beautifully. And it definitely doesn't hurt that Tuesday Weld is a goddess of apple-cheeked carnality and conspicuous consumption. She may not be Everywoman exactly, but she IS Everywoman who ever dreamed of marrying Elvis, and that's good enough - like the King, you can't help falling in love with her. As has been noted, the 'cashmere sweater' scene is among the most erotic ever caught on film - unnervingly so, given she's playing the scene with, and for, her father. The movie is chockfull of scenes that similarly push black humor and social satire past the threshold of good taste or story logic; you're either going to go with it, or reject it altogether. I recommend the former: like a lot of underrated and outright ignored 60s movies that don't comfortably fit into any standard category, LORD LOVE A DUCK rewards the viewer who's willing to suspend disbelief for an hour-and-a-half with a totally absorbing and unique unreality all its own. It's a buzz you can only get from an American film made between JFK's fall and the rise of Tricky Dick, and it's a hoot besides.",998697600,16,2291,5.0

812409,4,6304237707,"George Axlerod made his directorial debut in as blunt and assertive a manner as you might expect of an experienced writer.  ""Lord Love A Duck"" is an unapologetic, frank condemnation of the American fascination with teen life during the 1960s.  Through the participatory narration of its lead character 'Mollymauk"" (portrayed by the always excellent Roddy McDowall,) ""Lord Loves"" tells the story of how one teen's admiration of a vacuous, ambitious and me-centered beauty ""Barbara Ann"" (brilliantly performed by Tuesday Weld) leads to a series of hilarious, frightening and at least one outright disturbing series of events impacting the lives of the adults surrounding the manipulative teen pair.  The movie attacks everything from consumerism and conspicuous consumption to the odd nature of the relationship between parents and teens just on the verge of adulthood.  Axlerod's contempt for the approach parents take in attempting to relate to teens in parity (as opposed to being more authoritarian) could not be made more clear in scene after scene.  The movie's seminal moment is universally agreed upon as the ""cashmere sweater scene.""  Attempting to describe its meaning and purpose does not do it justice.  It is the one scene in film history that simply has to be seen to be believed---or perhaps ""experienced"" is the better word for it.  It is absolutely brilliant.

The movie does have its drawbacks, however.  The second half of the film dealing with Barbara Ann and Mollymauk's attempt at ending her marriage to her marriage-counselor husband Bob grinds out slowly; becoming absurd at the point just before the movie reaches its conclusion.  Ruth Gordon provides a solid performance as the disapproving mother-in-law, and Lola Albright and Harvey Korman round out a cast which performs perfectly in each of their respective contributions to the movie's message and theme.  The office scene between Weld and Korman is an in-your-face comment by the director about how society has abdicated its responsibilities toward youth and the means by which this is accomplished.  The symbolism makes this scene, in my opinion, the second most revealing in the film.

""Lord Love A Duck"" is a cinematic achievement, and was well ahead of its time in terms of message and presentation to the audience.  If you are a fan of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" or ""Heathers,"" you owe this film a close viewing.  Each of those films are clear tips of the hat to Axlerod's prescient masterpiece.  Highly-reoommended.",1366848000,4,2501,5.197007481296758
812410,3,6304237707,"I saw this movie decades ago, when it was initially released.  I watched it again because I thought it would be interesting to see if my view of it had changed.  Not really.  It was goofy then, and it's goofy now.  It's interesting, though, to note the 60's film values, the parody of popular culture and the ""shallow depth"" of our social understanding.",1364515200,,353,4.555555555555555
812411,5,6304237707,A great classic film with lovely Tuesday Weld & Roddy McDowell. A Dark comedy from the 60's. Enjoyable film with some tragedy.  Great price & Quality!,1351468800,,150,4.769230769230769
812412,5,6304237707,"At first glance, George Axelrod's, Lord Love a Duck appears to be a satire of 60's beach party movies.  It's only dressed in a bikini though; underneath it actually takes a wickedly humorous and sometimes painfully dark jab at California 1960's culture.  It's the ""me culture"" gone mad.  It spares none of its characters, all of whom are obsessed with attaining what they want, at any expense. Women use sex to get what they want from men, men use women to get sex, and the poor sap who actually marries a woman is ultimately done in by her.  Commercialism rules, and she who dies with the most cashmere sweaters wins.

The film's characters are viewed through the eyes of Alan Musgrave, (Roddy McDowall) a senior at Consolidated High School. He is the only character who is aware of the corrupt nature of this society, and yet is ultimately proven to be certifiably insane.

Alan meets the beautiful Barbara Ann Green, (Tuesday Weld) another Consolidated student, and immediately is taken with her to the point of madness.  He knows she would never consider him as a romantic prospect, so he finds content just being near her.  He'll do anything to make her happy, and this proves to be extremely challenging because what she wants changes at any given moment.

First it's twelve cashmere sweaters; a must have for Barbara Ann to gain admittance to an elite clique of girls. Alan patiently explains, F (father) + D (divorce) x G (guilt) squared = 13 cashmere sweaters.  ""It's the new math, Barbara Ann!""

Barbara Ann meets her father (Max Showalter) for lunch and plays the coy kitten schmoozing him for all she's worth.  Following lunch they go shopping in one of the most bizarre scenes in film history.  Barbara Ann squeals in an erotic frenzy while modeling a candy colored array of sweaters for her father.  He laughs wildly, his face contorting in response.  Yes, it's bad, but it is so ridiculously hysterical at the same time you can't keep from laughing out loud.  This is in no small part due to the incredible laughing ability of Showalter.

Needless to say, Barbara Ann gets her sweaters. Next is a long line of requests: arrangements to go to a beach party, getting the man she wants, getting rid of the man she wanted, and ultimately stardom. Alan is a man with a self proclaimed mission and he happily goes from new math to murder to accomplish his objective.

Alan feels no remorse for his actions, they were justified.  Why?  Because his is not like those self absorbed suburbanites motivated by greed, envy and lust.  No, his motives were altruistic; he did it for love --- L O V E.

The plot is simple enough, what takes this movie to the level of brilliance is Axelrod's portrayal of the foolishness and vanity of western society.  From drive-in churches to pop psychology to politically correct high school courses where there's a penchant for agenda rather than end result, we see ourselves though a mirror darkly --- that mirror being black comedy.
This wacky film is admittedly somewhat ridiculous; but I think that was Axelrod's intent --- to create what appears to be a ridiculous film to demonstrate how ridiculous we (and our sacred cows) really are.

Unfortunately, 1960's audiences never really appreciated Lord Love a Duck.  It has since developed a cult following, yet remains relatively obscure.  Perhaps most of us are still not ready to accept how silly we, and our obsessions, really are.",1344729600,6,3425,4.772495755517827
812466,4,6304237707,"Filmmaker George  Axelrod described it as `Love Finds Andy Hardy' meets `Dr. Strangelove', and that's as good a sum up as any.

Part deeply witty, very dark, surreal satire of American life (very good), part lowbrow wacky comedy (not as good) part parody of the early 60s Beach Party movies (starts funny but burns out), and part serious drama about how screwed up families are (quite strong considering it's in the middle of all the silliness).

Sort of like Kurt Vonnegut in terms of its constant, head snapping shifts in tone.

Roddy McDowell (almost 40 at the time!) plays a high school senior, who is a genius/Puck/gay? figure who gets obsessed (but not sexually) with making the dreams of a hot, seemingly vacuous blond (Tuesday Weld) come true.  Both are wonderful.

Along the way there's murder, heavy hints of incest, and lots of other American family fun.

Some of it doesn't work, or feels dated, but terrific when it clicks, and gets big style points for being so brave and unique.

Sort of what you might get if Almodovar made films in the US in the 1960s.",1312156800,3,1069,4.679144385026738

812468,2,6304237707,"Granted, it WAS the '60s, but that's no excuse for this heavy-handed satire. You'll want to soundly slap just about everyone involved in it (well, except for the wondrous Ruth Gordon).

I figured this to be a last-ditch attempt to make a teen idol of sad old queen Roddy McDowell.

Many of the scenes, especially those involving Tuesday Weld and her ""father,"" have a real John Waters feel -- I found myself wondering if the Master of Sleaze had seen this abortion of a movie.

Make like it's the '60s again and watch it high -- otherwise, you won't be able to stomach it.",1189987200,4,571,4.471153846153846

812470,5,6304237707,"Hey-hey-hey!  This ""crazy"" film helped me stay sane.  KTLA TV in Los Angeles used to play it on a semi-regular basis in the bleary-eyed hours of the morning.  That's when Lord Love a Duck first did its magic and made me see the light.  Of course, since then, it's been on VHS and DVD (with a bonus auto-bio on director George Axelrod), so now there's no excuse but to put aside everything and see this movie now.

Just off the top, there's nothing quite as satisfyingly bent as the father & daughter go cashmere sweater shopping sequence.  It defies print.  For that achievement alone I would give the film 5 stars!  Fortunately though, there's lots more to appreciate.

As much as I LOVE ""Love a Duck"", it does have its flaws.  The comic momentum sags a bit in the middle, especially the lead-up and suicide committed by Barbara Anne's mother.  That's where the smart and darkly-styled comedy veers into staid drama.  And mixed-genres do have way of going afoul (or a-FOWL, in this case).  But this was Axelrod's first go as a director and there are way more gains than losses here.  His anarchistic approach is, after all, consistent with the theme and persona of lead character Maulymuck, played by McDowall.

When discussing movies, I often recommend that people see this film and they almost never know what I'm talking about.  Lord Love a Duck falls undeservedly off the radar.  I think this is due to its unique but worthy quirks which seem to broadside people's expectations.  How do you place LLAD in term of its' antecedents or influences on other films?  --best not to.  Its humor is spread subtly and not hung up on a single peg.  It's not that easily ""branded"" -- the most overused buzz-word of the last decade.

The Lord Love a Duck soundtrack by Neil Hefty is a great find too, if you can fish it out of Ebay.",1120694400,8,1824,4.564814814814815
812471,4,6304237707,"Just to see Tuesday Weld (never better!), Roddy McDowall (rarely better)and Ruth Gordon (always wonderful, no matter what she's in) romp through this comic mess is worth the price of the DVD, and then some. I saw this film when it came out in the 60s and didn't like it much, but bought the DVD hoping I might find more in it than I did as a teenager. Turns out I really enjoyed it the second time around. It makes fun of a lot of different things and has an edge about it in the process. School, school administrators, authority figures, parents, shrinks, teenagers, consumerism, fame, dating, social snobism---you name it and it's a target. There are several scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny: Tuesday Weld going out with her father (she lives with her divorced mother), first to a drive-in fast food joint and then on a sweater-buying shopping spree; Harvey Korman in all his scenes. (By the way, what I really find interesting about 60s films is how much people smoked and drank, even in comedies. Lola Albright, very good as Weld's cocktail-waitress mother, just pours herself a stiff one when things get tough. It's almost jarring how that type of on-screen behavior has changed over the last 40 years.)

812472,5,6304237707,"The only way I can imagine this movie got made was that some Hollywood executive who was completely confused and clueless about what would appeal to younger viewers in the sixties agreed to allow this very strange George Axelrod film to be filmed.  In a vague way, it seems almost to be an updating of FAUST, with Roddy McDowell as Alan ""Mollymauk"" Musgrave playing Mephistopheles to Tuesday Weld's Barbara Ann.  Through all manner of devious means Mollymauk brings Barbara Ann's every dream come true.
Viewers are either going to love this or hate it.  I showed it to my daughter, and she thought it one of the strangest films she had ever seen.  And so it is.  It is one of those films, like BEING JOHN MALKOVICH or THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T that seems too off-the-wall for anyone to have agree to finance it.
