8686134,3,B00P1YBF36,"A verbose supernatural melodrama with an agenda: to warn us spectators of the ""dangers"" of occultism and to avoid practicing spiritualism. It includes a long, wordy scene where a spiritualist leader explains the excellences and virtues of this practice, its connection to all religions, or the link between good spirits and classical music. But outside of those dark rooms and into the house of a middle-class Mexican family,  the story that is told is far more interesting than all the proselytizing, or the sessions with Ouijas and fainting mediums: a young man asks his parents to mortgage their home to open a crop dusting business. He does so after the party of their silver wedding anniversary, when the father had finally given his wife the title deeds as a present. Against what she was warned during the first sance we see, the mother, who is a domineering, manipulative and ambitious woman, tells her husband to do what their only child says. Trouble follows, and pretty soon the mother is asking the Devil for money, bringing tragedy to her family. Using the W.W. Jacobs' tale ""The Monkey's Paw"" to round up the script, in its scariest moments the movie sometimes made me remember Maurice Tourneur's ""La main du Diable"" and Robert Florey's ""The Beast with Five Fingers"", but quite often it is the typical family melodrama with tearful histrionics the Mexicans cherish. Unfortunately the script takes so much time to give lectures about spiritualism, that there is not much left for the ""real thing"", and the final act is incredibly fast. The copy by VCI Entertainment in Spanish is very good, but Augusto Benedico (as the priest) has disappeared from the prologue. The movie begins when the husband goes to church to tell the priest what has happened. Benedico is only seen in a brief close-up that dissolves to the past, as the husband narrates what happened to his family. Director Benito Alazraki, who made an auspicious debut with the motion picture ""Races"" (Roots) in 1954, was no stranger to horror. He had made before (also for producer Guillermo Caldern) the cult classic ""Muecos infernales"" (The Curse of the Doll People) that went for pure horror, but in ""Espiritismo"" he was subject to Caldern's forementioned agenda.",1447372800,3,2239,4.970666666666666
8686135,4,B00P1YBF36,"Not bad Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no sub-titles) spooky tale of spiritism and involving oneself in forces beyond ones control.  A retiring couple finally pay off their mortgage and look forward to peaceful golden years.  Their well-meaning but lazy son doesn't want to spend his life working so he comes up with a get-rich-quick scheme.  The couple, to prove their love for him, mortgage their home to the eyeballs.  When things go wrong they get into spiritism and dark forces to resolve their problems.  The moral of this story is don't get involved in spooky stuff and DON'T bet your holdings on an unsure thing.  As I saw in another review more Twilight Zone-ish than a horror film.  This film is also available English-dubbed under the title Spiritism.  The VCI Entertainment DVD release is fine quality and worth getting.  Recommended for fans of spooky films.",1422662400,4,872,5.041958041958042
