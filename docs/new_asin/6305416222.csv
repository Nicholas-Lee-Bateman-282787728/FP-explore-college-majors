1017430,3,6305416222,"Really a three-and-a-half star rating. The most expensive film ever made at the time, (and also among the most decisive failures at the box-office for it's day) ""Lost Horizon"" succeeds in transporting us into a  world borne of vibrant cinematic imaginations and magic; but finally lets  us off the hook by failing to fully amount to it's lofty aims. The early  sequences, however--the chaos of panicked thousands fleeing the  revolutionaries; Conway's desperate escape by airplane with a gallery of  amusing characters; the passengers' realization of their abduction by a  mysterious pilot; the crash in the Himilayas; the meeting of the passengers  and the column from Shangri-La; and the breathtaking first glimpses of the  utopian paradise--are so magnificent that you can only marvel at Frank  Capra's skill at drawing us in so triumphantly right from the outset.  Unfortunately, the entire point of the story--the shock and disillusionment  of man with the outside world after prolonged assimilation into a utopian  society--is blunted by the treating of it almost as an afterthought.  Shangri-La, land of idyllic existence and very expensive sets, is shown off  nearly to the point of redundancy; Conway's treacherous trek back to  civilization is recreated with generous attention; but then, the pivotal  crisis of conscience that persuades Conway to risk a hazardous return to  Shangri-La is relegated to almost a bookend, as a table of old English  society peers of his hastily recount his recent experiences to the  audience. This uneven approach disappointingly muffles the level of viewer  satisfaction. Additionally, John Howard is more than a little irritating as  Conway's suspicious brother. For all that, casting, direction, and music  are hard to fault. Ronald Colman is here, along with ""Prisoner of  Zenda,"" given perhaps his best tailored role ever. Veteran character  actors Thomas Mitchell and Edward Everett Horton keep the laughs coming  with their friendly rivalry. Sam Jaffe's utterly persuasive portrayal of  the old, old, old lama put him on the Hollywood map. And H.B. Warner's  performance as the enigmatic Chang can serve as an object lesson to today's  actors on how to steal a picture through fiercely controlled  understatement. Frank Capra, here at his cinematic zentith, should probably  have won the Academy Award for Best Direction for 1937. And Dimitri  Tiomkin's beautiful musical score was perhaps the best ever written for any  movie up until that time. In the final run of things, though, ""Lost  Horizon"" seems more impressive than great. As a viewing experience,  however, it is unforgettable.",931564800,25,2638,5.353658536585366

1017645,5,6305416222,"This is a review of the Blu-ray version of Lost Horizon.

We purchased this Blu-ray to replace our previous copy that was on VHS tape.

During the intervening years, additional footage has been found of the film, and additional restoration work has been done.

Viewing the Blu-ray, it is very obvious that the detail, contrast, stability, and sound have all improved a great deal.

The older version still had some dirt and scratches, jittery segments, very soft and grainy segments, and other defects,  These have all been greatly remedied.  Other reviewers have commented on the improvements and they are significant.  The upgrade to this latest Blu-ray effort is well worth it.

The story itself continues to inspire thoughtful reflection.  For deeper background, view another of James Hilton's stories, ""Goodbye Mr. Chips,"" in either the 1969 musical version or the 1939 non-musical version.  Although the stories are different, the sensibility of the writing is similar and the themes below the surface are similar.  Well done!",1519603200,,1032,5.2317073170731705

1017647,5,6305416222,"The movie Lost Horizon is a 1937 American drama-fantasy film directed by Frank Capra and based on the 1933 novel of the same name by James Hilton.  The film was produced at a time when Hollywood still made reasonable themed films, and this one is a mixture of the then current eastern world with a bit of fantasy mixed in.  But it's good fantasy.

The story is about five people, trying to escape from war torn China in 1935, and whose plane is hijacked and flown on a mysterious flight path further west into China and Tibet.  The plane eventually runs out of fuel and crashes deep in the Himalayan Mountains, killing the pilot.  The passengers are miraculously rescued and taken to Shangri-La, an idyllic valley sheltered inside the ring of several mountains from the otherwise bitter high altitude mountain cold.  Initially anxious to return to civilization, four of the newcomers grow to love utopian Shangri-La where humans live hundreds of years, where human relationships are voluntary, no masters and no slaves, and where there is no formal government or formal religion, nor laws, nor money, nor force and violence.  The people try to be kind to each other.  My kind of place.

In 2017, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray, transferred from 4k scan restoring another minute of previously lost footage, for a total run time of 133 minutes. This cut of the film includes audio corresponding to footage that remains unrecovered, accompanied by promotional stills and behind the scenes photos. The bonus features and commentary from the 1999 release were retained for the Blu-ray edition.

For its time period, this was a very well done movie, and because of its theme, you will not find Hollywood making a film of this theme in the 21st century.  If you are into collecting and enjoying older movies, this 133 minute version is a keeper.",1518912000,5,1869,4.864353312302839

1017881,5,6305416222,"I have always loved this film and Capra was truly a unique and gifted filmmaker. In the 1990s the new extended cut was released with the original 133 min. running time although several minutes of camera negative was forever missing and random still photos of the actors were inserted into these segments. It was a thrill as a budding filmmaker to see these lost moments from a classic film thought to be forever lost to legend. However... once this version was finally released after decades of exhaustive work by film archivists,  the shorter version that most people in the world grew up with and lovingly know, soon became the red headed adopted step child and was relegated to mere memory and existed only on VHS copies sitting on dusty and neglected video shelves around the world.

I was awaiting 2017 (which was the 80th anniversary of the films release) and hoping beyond hope a lush blu ray edition would finally be released with BOTH versions. The moment I heard it was due for release in the back of my mind I feared the worst and Columbia Pictures did not let me down in my worries. This edition ONLY contains the now accepted long running version of the film. While this version is great to watch once in awhile and is of obvious historical importance, it is also highly flawed in one huge aspect, the still-photograph scenes take one out of the motion picture experience. As a director, this is ones worst nightmare, once out-of-a-film it is very difficult to get the audience back into it. This is the ONLY negative comment I have for this disc package, but it is a huge one. There is NO reason what so ever not to have BOTH versions on this disc. Hundreds of other less important films have this feature. I find this practise by the director/ film company a frustrating one in that they wish to re-write history and only have their new precious directors cut available and have the original theatrical version fade into memory until they can argue that it never really existed in the first place. Echoes of Big Brother and 1984...perhaps?
I have no problem with a director producing his/her version after the fact as long as any other version that has been released, either on the screen during its original theatrical release or later only on video, is also made available on the same disc package. Thankfully only a few films fall into this sad category, the original 1977 version of Star Wars being the most infamous at the time of this writing. Disney is also a prime culprit in covering up their racist and politically incorrect past with forever edited versions of some of their classic films knowing full well that memories are short and any nay sayers will eventually be drowned out in the tide of time. I have no problem with acknowledging the failings of past generations, (we are all of course only human and a product of our times) and there are many as far as Hollywood is concerned, but to cover up film history is a crime against truth and art. I suppose corporate thinking is all powerful and they feel that we the peon public CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH...!  But that is another essay worthy topic, far too exhaustive a subject to discuss here.  Onward...

The transfer is AMAZING and the best we are likely to see until a 35mm fine grain print of the complete film is finally uncovered somewhere in the world, hopefully with the missing reels of The Magnificent Ambersons. 
The 16mm scenes look as good as they probably can be seeing as they are the only existing footage of that photography for the time being. One can only dream how glorious a transfer from the original 35mm negative would look like. That is a Shangri-La dream.

The extras are quite good. The commentary is an older existing and excellent recording that is well worth listening to.  The book form is filled with great pix on glossy high quality paper. A must purchase at a very reasonable price for any film collection.",1509321600,2,3918,4.6354466858789625

-- Five reasons why you should get the new Blu-Ray:
1) It has one additional minute of new material not in the 1999 DVD.
2) Much better picture and sound than the 1999 DVD.
3) It comes packaged in a 32 page hard-cover book.
4) SDH subtitles for everything: even the audio commentary has it's own subtitles
5) Really cheap. They're practically giving it away.

-- 1937 (March) When it was newly released, Frank Capra's 'Lost Horizon' was 132 minutes long
-- 1937 (September) Columbia Pictures cut it to 118 minutes (and promptly ""lost"" 14 minutes)
-- 1942: Cut to 110 minutes
-- 1948: Restored to 118 minutes
-- 1952: Cut to 92 minutes and sold to television
-- 1986: Restored to 132 minutes by American Film institute and UCLA
-- 1999: DVD release of 132 minute version
-- 2017: Blu-Ray release of 132 minute version, updated and digitally remastered in 4-K

Frank Capra's 132 minute 1937 version no longer exists.
But the people responsible for the 1986 restoration got lucky and found the original 132 minute soundtrack (audio only).
They then assembled every available print and fragment of the film in existence, and painstakingly synchronized the surviving visual elements to the 132 minute soundtrack.
They even found the video for 7 of the 14 minutes ""lost"" in 1937, matched them to the soundtrack, and restored them to 'Lost Horizon'.
The restored print had 125 minutes of video and 132 minutes of audio.
Their solution for the missing 7 minutes was to use still photos of the missing scenes matched to the 7 minutes of audio.

Good News: Following the release of the 1999 DVD, one additional minute of ""lost"" video was discovered and appears for the first time in the 2017 restoration:
It's in chapter 8 where Ronald Colman first meets the High Lama played by Sam Jaffe.
Additionally a better-looking 16mm print of the cut version was discovered.
These two discoveries were the inspiration for the new restoration released in 2017.
They were able to use modern 4-K digital restoration techniques, unavailable in 1986, to clean up the picture and sound for Blu-Ray.
The ""new"" restored print has 126 minutes of video and 132 minutes of audio.
6 minutes of still photos.

The blu-ray gives you a choice of five languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian), plus subtitles in 23 languages.",1508371200,64,2391,4.8504901960784315

Nevertheless, in my youth as an elementary school student, I read the novel by James Hilton, viewed the movie and the song ""Shangri-La"" was a hit on the radio and in TV commercials.  It movie takes place in the Himalaya Mountains with a secret passage to a lost world.  Although released in 1937, Lost Horizon was a popular movie to escape into a fantasy world while World War II raged on in reality.  This is a movie worthy of the five star rating and preserved for inclusion among immortal classic films.",1506902400,4,746,4.7
1017935,5,6305416222,"The real life base (Dr. Li Ching-Yun, 1677-1933) adds to the wonder and mystery. Many movies usually pale compared to the book; however this movie fits all the criteria of a great classic. Such as excellent film footage for the time, even though some scenes are missing. When I look at the Shangri-La setting some times my mind wanders and I wonder if this was the idea behind the valley in the book ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand?

I doubt that they could have picked any better actors for the parts. These actors fit the time and surroundings and were actually believable in the characters they played. A later remake of this movie was o.k. But just did not have the presence of these actors.

Now the DVD features:
Digitally remastered Audio & Anamorphic Video
Production Notes
Restoration Before and After Comparison

1018022,5,6305416222,"There are two film versions of the book. This one, despite being eighty years old, is great. It won two academy awards in 1937. I look forward to viewing the 1973 version as well. The message in the book and films is very important. Unfortunately, while the message is correct, the only place where it is practiced is in Shangri-La, a utopia. Considerate parents will make sure that they have their children watch the film. Hopefully, it will aid in creating a better world.
It is the story of a well-respected English diplomat who discovers that his pilot has taken him and his companions to a city far from where he intended to go. He does not know why the pilot did so. In fact, the man who piloted the plane was not the man who was supposed to fly it. The city, called Shangri-La, is in a plain which is surrounded by huge snow covered mountains which protect the inhabitants from the cold. Unlike elsewhere, everybody in the city is friendly and welcoming and smiling.
He discovers after a while that the inhabitants of the city live in peace, where the rule is that one must respect the other. There is no money in the city. The mountains have gold, but the inhabitants have no need of it. Remarkably, the climate is such that people live in Shangri-La for a long time. The founder is over two hundred years old. Beside the climate, the lack of stress, worry, and strife in the city contributes to their health. Animals in Shangri-La walk about without fear. We see deer in the street. There are birds flying about.
The diplomat was promised a high government position in England towards which he was flying. Will he decide to remain in Shangri-La and forsake the honors of the government position? Will all of his companions want to remain?",1500336000,2,1747,4.56687898089172

Mystery, romance, peace, happiness, a sense of purpose, health --all that anyone could want. But some deliberately turn away. Is it a thinly veiled image of heaven? Heaven on earth?

I was hoping this download was the new restoration but it is not. The restored version has been released in Australia but not here. This is an older version (from the late 90s) which is missing newly recovered scenes. It has dirt and sparkle all over the film throughout the entire running time. The overall image is soft and highlights tend to be blown out. Black levels vary enormously, from fuzzy dark greys to grainy shadows. Film grain is visible but distorted due to the compression of the download. It would probably be a nice patina of film grain in a proper HD version. I'm not sure how many of these issues are due poor restoration, but quite a lot is probably simply the nature of the film elements (some parts are from 16mm prints). Nevertheless, if anyone else was expecting an updated version of the film, this is not it. I have no idea why it has been 4 years since the restoration and still no Blu-ray or HD download.",1486857600,17,1102,4.4068627450980395

The city of Shangri-La is very well done, and fun to see for the CA scenery. The other interior sets are beautiful, too. The character development is just right, if a bit slow-paced for modern audiences. I enjoy this movie mostly for the middle. And Ronald Coleman's voice. Other items not so pleasant are the depictions of Mongolians, religion, education & attitudes towards females.

Looked at through a more modern lens, the film could have delved deeper into racial, economic and political divisions still abusing our peace but there is no denying Capra's intentions and interests in pointing out the worlds transgressions, toleration for aggression and war.  Conway represents the ""cost"" paid for peace - letting go and letting be.  And Shangri La represents the mystical and all that could be accomplished if only...

A marvelous fantasy picture, Capra's masterpiece is based on the best-seller novel by James Hilton (1935). It is tragic that the original full-length movie was edited down and cut up in the editing room a few years afterward for another release, and that no original nitrate film prints or negatives have survived (like another famous classic film, Fritz Lang's science fiction masterwork METROPOLIS (1926), so we have no surviving master of the original release. Fortunately, this well-constructed restoration version gives us all a sense of the grandeur of the original roadshow presentation of this film.

1018458,5,6305416222,"In today's climate, in this age of fashionable snark and cynicism, I don't know that author James Hilton's LOST HORIZON would've made a triumphant go of it in cinema, not without some modicum of tweaking. Back in 1937, Frank Capra adapted the novel into a grand fantasy adventure onscreen and movie-goers came in droves. And maybe in a bit I'll mention the terribly juicy behind-the-scenes stuff. Because this movie was NOT easy to make.

""In these days of wars and rumors of wars -- haven't you ever dreamed of a place where there was peace and security, where living was not a struggle but a lasting delight?"" is the title card that opens the movie and presents a premonition as to its plot. In 1935, in the turbulent Chinese city of Baskul, Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) is dispatched to evacuate ninety white people lest they're slaughtered in a bloody local uprising. Conway himself barely escapes, fleeing in a tiny plane with a smattering of survivors (white, of course).

Conway is big noise in western civilization, touted as England's ""Man of the East."" His past achievements have been so prodigious that he seems a shoe-in for the grand post of Foreign Secretary. A soldier, a diplomat, a public hero, Conway's mettle is continuously tested during this harrowing passage, first by the natterings of his vacuous fellow passengers, then by his weak-willed brother's (John Howard) panic attack, then by their plane's brutal descent. Crash-landed in the remote, terrifying mountains and chasms of Tibet, Conway and company find a haven in the hidden valley of Shangri-La, a mysterious place that has never known strife or vice and where aging seems severely, supernaturally retarded.

LOST HORIZON is an honorable movie, the old-fashioned sort that's meant when people today say ""They don't make 'em like they used to."" It's a movie that posits a philosophy based on abiding optimism and unbounding faith in man's inherent common sense and nobility. See, back in the day, Frank Capra relished all that hokum. He was genious enough and savvy enough to sell sentiment to the common people. Back in the day, they lapped it up. Today, we, with our breed of jeerers and hecklers, would've laughed it off. We want no truck with idealism come in such naive form. It ain't hip.

""What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?"" asks a curious Conway of the gentle, venerable High Lama (Sam Jaffe), and maybe there's deep yearning in the way he asks. Those familiar with what Ronald Colman brings to the table think that an unnecessary inquiry. The man embodies the pure essence of the noble hero. And it's also always a thinking man's hero. Colman projects sophisticated wit, a formidable intelligence, vast reserves of resourcefulness, and an elegant style. His interpretations of A.J. Raffles, Franois Villon, Rudolf Rassendyll, and Robert Conway are incomparable stuff.

It's an admirable cast: Edward Everett Horton as the milquetoast paleontologist, Thomas Mitchell as the blowhard swindler, Isabel Jewell as the dying soiled dove, John Howard as Conway's sycophant and increasingly paranoid younger brother. But the gem performances are credited to Jane Wyatt as the luminous Sondra and to then 38-year-old Sam Jaffe who piles on a heap of make-up to pass as the ancient High Lama. I wonder if Jaffe was at all apprehensive about taking on the role? After all, the two earlier actors tapped for his part both died upon landing the part.

LOST HORIZON was a labor of love for Frank Capra, and the man suffered tribulations to get this sucker finished. Production was notoriously delayed for a bunch of reasons. Maybe Capra shouldn't have used real ice and snow in the shoot as those elements only served to crack and fatigue and freeze and destroy sundry filming equipment. There are times when verisimilitude can just go suck it. Too, Capra's preference for shooting multiple takes resulted in over a million feet of film, and you can imagine the studio heads pulling their hair out. LOST HORIZON's preview screening was disastrous, doubtless in large part due to the initial three hours' running time, a huge chunk of which constituted an extended prologue (that was then excised). Today, what we have is a movie of which restored version goes 2 hours, 12 minutes. Sadly, lost film footage compels us occasionally to eyeball image stills as we listen to the audio track. But that's a small price to pay for a glimpse of Shangri-La and a dream that seems to get further away as the days go on.",1450051200,6,4512,4.9302631578947365

1018651,5,6305416222,"I am a 45 year old man now, and was looking for something to lift me up and out of my melancholy state.  I remember my mother making me watch this with her when I was ten years old.  I was upset with her for quite a spell, until I was drawn in at around the 43 minute mark.  Even at ten, I understood the message:  Shangri La is an 'Eden' or 'Utopia' of sorts. It's an allegory of an unattainable, nearly intangible place for most of us. We all have an idea of what we want in an idyllic earthbound life, but we are all so far from it.
To be sure, the Utopian vision here is slightly ignorant and racist, in that the 'natives' who are the keepers of secret of immortality, are subjects of the white priest who discovered it, and surrounds himself with other whites who teach and lead those not of the same race. So, the message may be a little off-putting for someone not white (myself being one of those people.)  However, the message is a good one, as this movie sent me down the road of my Buddhist path, even though the goal of the Great Shaman himself (the white priest) was to promote a Christian ideology that would emerge from the ashes of the great powers destroying one another...'And the meek shall inherit the earth.'
I guess, the point is, I still love this movie.  The characters were not very deep when compared to the book, but the message was clear, and that is why 'Lost Horizons' gets five stars from me.",1432252800,4,1423,4.2518518518518515

Capra's dream project went way over budget and was considered far too long for commercial release. Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures took over the editing of the final film and trimmed it down for its initial release and then cut it some more for general release and then again for a re-release. The American Institute has attempted to restore the film to the way it was first shown in theaters. They tracked down the complete soundtrack and searched archives world wide to find as much of the cut material as possible. Much of the trimmed material survived only in 16mm so as the film unfolds you will see noticeable difference in pictorial quality. For sections where no visual material was found they filled in with stills from the film. The result is the most complete version of this Capra classic that has been possible to assemble. There are some nice Extras included on the disc. This is a major restoration of one of Frank Capra's most famous films.",1430956800,4,1083,4.645833333333333

Everyone dreams of somefar-off place of bliss. Also has a touch of the ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" to it in terms of those in Shangri-la were ageless.  It is one of my favorites and both Jane Wyatt and Ronald Colman who were Hollywood stars in their time are terrific.",1425254400,,537,4.203883495145631

Every time I start to think about how this much imagination, effort, and marvel there was about cinema from the ""good old days"" I recall what that was like for the average John and Mary Q Public- the Great Depression, memories of WWI and fear of of WWII, and the world seemingly being ripped apart.  That is no excuse for the 90% of the movie offerings of today- sequels (some of which are really great entertainment) and ""fart"" movies for the truly low hanging fruit.
My request to movie makers- you have many, many films like this which are giants, please stand on those shoulders much more often than you currently do.",1424563200,2,728,4.541984732824427

1019188,4,6305416222,"Lost Horizon--not much of a Hollywood hit when it was first released--has enjoyed more than cult status in the last quarter century.  The film was quite different than the typical Hollywood fare when first released.  Director Frank Capra knew the film was in trouble after preview showings, at which much of the audience walked out and most of the rest left negative comments.  His solution: start the film later, at the airport riot scene, when most main characters fight to escape the violence and--against all odds--manage to board the plane. So, the first 20 minutes of the original movie ARE really lost--thanks to Capra himself.  When your movie is in trouble, he joked later, burn the first two reels!  Alas, even with that drastic measure, the movie never was a genuine hit.

Today, it is different, but (alas, again!) no entire footage of the general release version exists.  At first, I found that fact startling--after all, when Columbia released the VHS tape of the movie, Lost Horizon was ONLY about 50 years old.  I am not amazed any more...many, many vintage movies--thousands, perhaps--no longer exist...or exist only in truncated form. When you read how some of even some stellar motion pictures were saved--sometimes by pure accident--it leaves one awestruck. Thank heavens people like Marty Scorsese and Clint Eastwood work to preserve and restore so many movies--even those  features millions of us saw just a few decades ago, in theaters as kids or even young adults.",1406937600,,1488,5.040816326530612

1019400,5,6305416222,"Shangri-La is a mystical, harmonious valley gently guided from a monastery of lamas; it is an earthly paradise. The story begins with a soldier and diplomat named Robert Conway, played by Ronald Colman, rescues 90 Westerners in Baskul, China during 1935 revolution and gets his plane hijacked and lands in mysterious place in Himalayan Mountains called Shangri-La. The founder of Shangri-La is several hundreds of years old, preserved by the magical properties of the paradise he has created and he wants Conway to head the mission as a future High Lama. Most residents are very old and had found peace in the valley and Conway is expected to lead. Initially he and his rescues wish to return to civilization, but gradually they learn to love Shangri-La, including paleontologist Alexander Lovett (Edward Everett Horton), swindler Henry Barnard (Thomas Mitchell) and terminally ill Gloria Stone (Isabel Jewell). Conway is particularly enchanted, especially when he meets Sondra (Jane Wyatt), who has grown up in Shangri-La. However, he changes his mind and leaves for his home in England. Eventually he changes his mind again and finds his way back to Shangri La. The highlight of movie is filming of snow scenes in Himalayas and the avalanche that kills many Conway's followers. It is a spectacular piece of photography even by today's standards with computer imagery and graphics.

The message of the movie is given by High Lama in his conversation with Conway, when he says, ""When brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword; against that time, is why I avoided death, and am here. And why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here, we shall be with their books and their music, and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind! When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.""

1019401,5,6305416222,"Its been a while since I wrote a review about such a revered film like the one that was on Turner Classics last night.  Lost Horizon stars Ronald Colman in one of his most famous roles.  A group of travelers escaping a revolution are kidnapped and taken to a place called Shangri-La.  Its a place where no one ever ages and can live hundreds of years without illness.  The leader of this paradise methodically orchestrated the abduction of  Ronalds character.  He wants him to take over as ruler of this fantastic land of  tranquility.

Its one of the first films I purchased back in the day, when I got my first VHS machine.  With each passing year, I see the film from a new perspective.  We all wish we could change the past or relive our youth and do things differently.  However if we took that dream to its extreme, wed soon find out wed still have the same problems, only worse.  If you ever get a chance to see this on Netflix or  DVD, Blue Ray or Amazon.com, its worth a look.

While I wouldn't call it science fiction, its more fantasy fiction.  The film expresses our desire to escape the fabric of civilization into a world were moderation, peace and tranquility are a way of life.

This film was remade in the mid-1970s with Peter (Network) Finch and Michael (Logans Run) York.  However it didn't have the same impact as the original.  Worst of all, the director turned it into a musical! It didn't capture the spirit of Shangri- La, even with the modern special effects. That was because the film was presented in such a way that it cant ever be remade without changing the characters. Some films are best left alone and Lost Horizon is one of them. It was a product of its time.

Firstly, the film came nowhere near close to the book, and every deleted scene or episode, and every ""new"" chapter did not fit well at all. The plot was butchered.  Many of the characters were hopeless caricatures of the people in the book.  Ronald Coleman was good, but even Thomas Mitchell was below par.  And Jane Wyatt was .....well, her character wasn't in  the book at all !!  And as far as being a ""classic"",  it fell terribly short of such real classics as ""Citizen Kane"", ""Paths of Glory"", and  many more.  The dialogue and acting were awfully antiquated & stilted,  and showed that Shangri La  is not exempt from aging !

The worst fault was the fact that the advertisements for the film , although mentioning that many scenes were cut (for political or ?? reasons) by the authorities, and that movie folks have ""restored it to near its  original content"",  did NOT mention that in many spots where the video was missing but the soundtrack was complete , the best the restoration folks could do was to insert a STILL PHOTOGRAPH of the person speaking since the video was missing .  Very amateurish solution, very annoying, and very boring.

If you must see it, buyer beware ---- rent it if possible but don't buy it.  You WILL be disappointed.  This was the 1st film I have reviewed for Amazon, but I would feel guilty if I said there were redeeming qualities to rescue this poor effort.",1392854400,2,1476,4.593869731800766

One part of it made no sense to me, though, since the pilot who brought them there was from Shambala, but what he did to the other pilot in order to take his place was not kind, never saw that pilot through the rest of the film, so perhaps he just knocked him out and threw him out of the plane before taking off, but he may have killed him.

1019562,5,6305416222,"I first saw this movie as a child and was captivated.  In the way of children's magical thinking, I believed a place called Shangri-La really existed.  Today, I realize it was the exquisite sets for the movie that made the place seem so real.  Fast forward 10 years or so and I read James Hilton's book as a teen.  Again, there was something about that story that caught my imagination.  I watched and read the movie and the book about 15 years ago and enjoyed them then.  Then last week, after having actually lived and worked in Asia for about a decade that I went back to Lost Horizon.  The language, the setting, the historical facts seemed accurate so I wasn't distracted by things that didnt' seem right.  And the story, the acting, the characters were as engaging as the first time.  This is a move that burnishes with age.  I found myself, at points, completely engrossed in the film.  Talk about taking you away from day to day cares.

I love this version as it is the one the American Film Institute restored in the early 1970s.  They found about 25 minutes of lost audio and most of the missing film.  In the places where they could not find film, they inserted studio shots of the scenes over the audio.  There's something about the honest attempt to piece together the full length original film and making the best of what is now available that was also very engaging.

One final personal note...we have a rescue dog that one of my kids thinks is a Tibetan Terrier.  She is always asking to go to Tibet to see Tibetan Terriers.  I keep trying to explain that Tibetan Terriers don't come from Tibet, but were named so by a traveler who saw the dogs while he was journeying to Tibet.  Well, this time around, I noticed not one but several Tibetan Terriers in the movie!  The props manager must have seen the name of the breed and, like my child, assumed these dogs were actually from Tibet.  My child of course now is convinced Tibetan Terriers are running wild all over Tibet.

It is in need of a blu ray restoration but unfortunately, there will still be a large portion of the second half of the film that is lost (unless someone, somewhere in the world uncovers miraculous lost footage) and stills are used to fill in the spots.  Directed by ""The Name above the Title"" himself, Frank Capra, and starring 20's and 30's cultured and debonair leading man Ronald Colman as well as some of the best supporting actors in film history (Thomas Mitchell and Edward Everett Horton & Sam Jaffe), this story of the eternal enchanted city of Shangri-La and the travelers who happen upon it after a plane crash has stood the test of time and ranks among the all-time classics of cinema.  It nearly bankrupted Harry Cohn and Columbia pictures and was the most expensive film of it's time with elaborate sets.  Thankfully for Capra and for Columbia, the film was able to recoup the cost of filming (2.7 mil, twice over the budget allotted) to make a profit (it took 5 years though).  It is especially dear to me as my grandmother went on her first date with my (now deceased) grandfather when the film came out in early 1937 and it brings back wonderful memories for her.  Much like Metropolis, Fritz Lang's silent masterwork, the lost footage and the still replacements can be a bit off putting to those not enamored of classic films and with little patience to sit through those sections of the film, but the sum of the parts in full are rewarding in the films culmination and will leave most viewers singing it's praises, I am sure.

1019644,3,6305416222,"Wanted to see this movie because I had read much about it (and the book) as being important classics of the Fantasy genre.

I've always known that the term ""Shangri-la"" stood for a fictional utopian place, but I didn't know the term came from the book ""Lost Horizons"" and, until I saw the movie, I never dreamed that ""Shangri-la"" was supposedly founded in 1713 by a Belgian Catholic priest named Fr. Perot (which fact must surely be fictional)!

According to this fictional story, the priest was given a vision of the future, and, based on that, he looked forward to a time when the ""Christian ethic"" would be realized on earth.  That is, he saw that eventually ""the meek would inherit the earth.""  First, however, there would be a terrible dark age when greed, brutality, and hatred of life would run rampant.  Every great work of art and literary treasure would be doomed to destruction as the strong and powerful people rampaged and devoured one another.  Fr. Perot took upon himself the founding of this new heaven on earth so that it would be awaiting the ""meek"" when the right time for their world came.  In a secret mountain stronghold in Tibet, the priest built Shangri-la, began the work of collecting the earth's great books and art for safekeeping there, and became the spiritual head, already ahead of time, of a large community of people whose main purpose was to ""Be Kind.""

These are some background facts about the Shangri-la that one visits in ""Lost Horizon,"" the movie.  Not having read the book by James Hilton, I am unsure if all these same facts appear in the book.  According to reviewers, the movie version of the story made some significant changes in the book story and some preferred the book to the movie.

Shangri-la in the movie is a curious and unexpected place.  It's nothing like a medieval monastery, and there are none of the usual traditional symbols of Christianity.  The architecture is in a sort of futuristic, art deco style.  The majority of the residents seem to be Oriental.  Tibetan, I guess.  There are a few British and European residents, and they sometimes wear Chinese-style clothing, but some of them sometimes wear Western-style Hollywoodish clothing.  The community is called a ""lamasery,"" and the overall flavor of the place is Oriental, except for the European art works on the walls and the European furnishings and dishes.

The movie came out in 1937, and so the art deco architecture fits in with the mode of that time period.  The movie producer was Frank Capra, who did other uplifting and inspirational message-movies like the also very popular ""It's a Wonderful Life.""

My copy of the movie was a VHS and the tape went blank and ended during a tense scene near the end of the movie, so, with my curiosity at a high pitch, I was cut off and left dying to know the details of how the story turned out. --In several spots, still shots of the actors' faces are used to bridge sections where pieces of film were entirely missing or unsalveagable during remanufacture of the movie.

I was bored with the long airplane flight at the beginning of the story, felt it was unnecessarily drawn out.

The movie posited a Chinese/Tibetan location near the border of those two countries, high up and isolated from the troubles of the world, where a basically all-welcoming religious community was made up of an eclectic mix of people, both single and married, who were not particularly concerned about religion per se.  It seemed that whoever happened along or was deliberately brought into the community was predestined by God to be there.  (The main character, Robert Conway  was ""brought there"" because he was meant to become the new abbot/lama.  [I noticed that most reviewers wrote about the head of Shangri-la as being a ""dalai lama."" To me, he seemed just a ""wise old man"" type.  He could have been an Eastern lama or a Western abbot, or a combination of both.])

(Interestingly, the Catholic Church, as part of a new evangelism, is now focusing upon the aesthetic quality of its art treasures and literature.  I wonder if behind the scenes it is also taking measures to preserve them against destruction and save them for the new ""civilization of love"" it is deliberately trying to create and leave behind for future generations on the earth.)

Several reviewers pointed out that the opening scene of the movie depicts foreign ""whites"" and Chinese desperately fleeing Baksul, China in 1935, running from the Revolutionary takeover, and this supposedly connects the movie with a ""socialist"" concern that was present in the 1930s.  (Could the story be construed as a subtle political argument of sorts in favor of a ""communal"" society?)

I never did understand why the character named Maria wanted so desperately to escape from this utopia of sustained youth unless it was because she wanted to stay with the character named George who also wanted desperately to escape.  Utopian felicity made George extremely nervous, it seems.

This story about Shangri-la seemed to me a fascinating but shallow fantasy.  I found it to be compelling entertainment but minimally thought-provoking.",1378339200,,5133,4.860919540229885

The 1933 film with Ronald Colman is excellent,very panstakingly restored in the DVD.
However it cannot rival the book which conveys an air of adventure,mystery and a sense of longing which cannot be completely conveyed in a film. The happy ending in the film,although essential for audience appreciation,did not happen in the book. In the book Conway was last heard of,close to the Thiland border,travelling with a team of porters,North West into Tibet,back to Shangri La. Judging from his physical fitness
efficiency in commanding people and utter determination,we could assume he finally returned to Shangri La.""Do you think he will ever find it?"" was the final sentence in the book.

1020436,5,6305416222,"I first saw this film as a child at least 40 years ago.  I recall being transfixed by it and certain scenes have stayed in my mind for years.  And now I've finally watched it again and I'm still in awe!  Afterwards, I was inspired to read the novel by James Hilton, upon which the film is based.  I was surprised to find out that this picture had been directed by Frank Capra; the only other film of his that I've seen is ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  What the 2 pictures have in common is that they definitely pull at the heartstrings; Capra is indeed a sentimentalist.  This effect is amplified by Dimitri Tiomkin's mesmerizing score; the music is perfectly in sync with the sensibility of this film.  The score even reminds me of that of 'The Wizard of Oz"" and similarly to ""The Wizard of Oz"" -- The fact that this picture touched me as a child, as well as in middle-age, is a testament to Capra's genius.

Everything in this film works.  Even though the restored version of the picture is of varying quality, and the effects / special effects are primitive by today's standards, there's a romantic quality to this film -- Visually, musically and in its underlying philosophical / spiritual message.  Shangri-La is a utopia where everyone lives by the principle of moderation, so rather than by religion -- One is guided by common sense -- Something that is still lacking in our present-day world.  The characters, although slightly stereotypical, are true to their time -- And they are all affected by the magic of Shangri-La in different ways.  Protagonist Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) immediately has a ""dj-vu"" experience upon seeing Shangri-La for the first time.  He knows that he has found his destiny.  He also finds romance with Sondra Bizet (Jane Wyatt).  The paleontologist Alexander P. Lovett (Edward Everett Horton) and fugitive financier ""swindler"" Henry Barnard (Thomas Mitchell) both find ways that they can contribute to the society of Shangri-La.  Bitter, terminally ill Gloria Stone (Isabel Jewell) appears to be much healthier after a short time.  She is being healed simply by being in Shangri-La.  All of the characters start to shed their old skins due to the positive vibes they receive in Shangri-La; their higher natures / versions of themselves literally proceed to ""bloom"".

On the other hand, Robert's brother George (John Howard) resists the charms of Shangri-La.  He is angry, he doesn't believe it, it's too good to be true; he wants to get out.  His love interest Maria (Margo) who has already been in Shangri-La since 1888, but who only looks 20, also wants to leave.  Unfortunately for both George and Maria -- Their departure ends up having tragic consequences ..... H. B. Warner has a pivotal role as the gentle Chang, whose character serves as Shangri-La's ""Voice of Reason"".  Another highlight of this film is Sam Jaffe's performance as the High Lama.  It is more than memorable -- It is spine-tingling!  I remember his scenes from when I first saw this picture in my childhood.  The authentic level of bliss and enlightenment attained by the High Lama before his death reminds me of the character of The Music Master in Hermann Hesse's masterpiece ""The Glass Bead Game"" (also influenced by ""Eastern spirituality"").  In the case of both characters -- These men evolve into, and then achieve, spiritual greatness.  And in having done so -- They are both free to leave the planet peacefully.

You are thrust right into the action as a group of British and Americans are frantically flown out of a suddenly dangerous Chinese Republic , in the throws of a raging civil war. As the endangered foreigners make it onto their plane, unbeknownst to them, the original British pilot is thrown from the plane and a Chinese pilot takes over, taking the plane on a western course instead of towards Shanghai. The scenes on the plane are mesmerizing and you feel like you are on board the old prop plane, a DC-3 I think. The motive of the hijacking is uncertain but the end result is a trip to Shangri-La for the planes occupants. A Utopian dreamland where aging virtually stops and and peace and a modest prosperity rule the land. Hilton's story is a metaphor for political choice contrasting the violence of the Chinese rebellion with the successful and peaceful society of Shangri-LA.

This is the one I remember from being on TV when I was a child. I now realize that I didn't really understand it at all. On the other hand, the notes on the DVD at the beginning said that it was cut considerably over the years, and they had quite a chore to find a copy that had all the original dialogue. It did not, however, have all the pictures properly lined up with the sound track, so there were several spots where they substitute still pictures while the dialogue continues. It's a little disconcerting, because I'm only guessing that the dialogue during those breaks is what what altogether missing from the one I saw on TV.

Robert Conway (Ronald Colman), writer and diplomat, has been dispatched to China to rescue a group of ""white people"" (i.e., not Chinese, mostly British and American) from the panic overtaking a revolutionary city airport. Somehow, he manages to get everyone out of there, but it turns out that his friend that he thought was piloting the plane was actually replaced by a Mongolian pilot who flies them in the wrong direction. With him are his brother George (John Howard), a very up tight anthropologist named Lovett (Edward Everett Horton), a rather boisterous salesman-like character named Barnard (Thomas Mitchell), and Gloria (Isabel Jewell), dressed like a floozie and very cynical. Turns out later she has already outlived her doctors' terminal diagnosis by six months, and isn't afraid when they discover the pilot is taking them the wrong direction, and then they crash in the snowy mountains.

But they don't die there. A group of monks dressed in thick fur coats comes out of the blizzard and guides them up the mountain to their ""lamasery,"" which turns out to be Shangri-La. A very tall, elegant and eminently hospitable old man named Chang (H.B. Warner) tells them that they have no method of communication with the world outside except a team of porters who show up every now and again. They are expected ""shortly,"" but it turns out they've been expected for about two years so far.

Eventually, Robert meets the High Lama, who is played by Sam Jaffe. I can't tell you anything about him without spoiling the story, but let's say he is a little like the Dalai Lama. But only a little.

There are two women who complicate the story. One is Sondra (Jane Wyatt), who is drawn to Robert Conway, and eventually confesses that she is the one who suggested he be brought there, as she has read all his books and decided he belonged in Shangri-La. And there is Maria, played by an actress who is simply called Margo, with no last name. She is supposedly a Russian, and she seduces George Conway, who has been hating the place and wanting desperately for the porters to show up and take them out of there.

Meanwhile, Barnard and Lovett, whom he insists on calling ""Lovey,"" go from pretty awful antagonism to good friends as they both decide they want to stay in Shangri-La. And Gloria wants to stay partly because of a growing relationship with Barnard and partly because her terminal illness has apparently gone away.

Robert decides he wants to stay, too, only partly because of Sondra. But when his brother George persuades him to leave with him and Maria when the porters agree to take them, things go horribly wrong.

Directed by Frank Capra

British diplomat Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) and a small group of civilians crash land in the Himalayas, and are rescued by the people of the mysterious, Eden-like valley of Shangri-la. Protected by the mountains from the world outside, where the clouds of World War II are gathering, Shangri-la provides a seductive escape for the world-weary Conway.

Ronald Colman's longfull heartbreak glance as he leaves Shangri-la, a soulful expression not easy to get out of one's mind.

Director Frank Capra takes us into a place of danger and turmoil and gives us a glimpse of what dreams are made of, we can all make it happen with just a little effort on our part.

'Lost Horizon' is indeed a remnant from the Golden Age of Cinema.

A truly great adventure with Colman at his best in the role of Conway

1020619,4,6305416222,"LOST HORIZON was one of my mom's favorite films. By the time I'd seen it on TV with her (the mid-1960s), about a half-hour of the original movie had been edted out by the studio. To be honest, all I recall of those childhood viewings are fragments: the plane going down in a snowstorm, the crash survivors' arrival at Shangri-la after a harrowing Himalayan ordeal, the brothers' depature at the end with a young lady who aged 50 years once she left the valley.

Seing this restored version, I cannot specifically say what scenes have been put back in, however, my first impression of the 132 minute picture is it drags in places, and it wouldn't surprise me if those scenes were the ones COLUMBIA excised decades ago.

Of the sections that only exist as stills with an audio track, it was clear to me that the lama's soliloquy had been tightened by some judicious snips (now restored). Some years of watching DVDs with director commentary concerning deleted scenes were useful in examining these once cut moments. Such thoughts as: ""redundant,"" ""doesn't advance the story"" and ""good but unnecessary"" came to mind on more than one occasion.

Clearly, the longest previously removed sequence that now is only audio track is the least needed of all. After Ronald Colman briefly takes over Jane Wyatt's school class, Thomas Mitchell's tutoring the kids just a few minutes later is ""redundant,"" ""good but unnecessary"" and it ""doesn't advance the story.""

If you're well-acquainted with the shortened LOST HORIZON, perhaps this revamped version won't be a revelation, but just a variation on a familiar theme.

1020623,5,6305416222,"Lost Horizon is the most beautiful movie I have seen. It starts off with the characters boarding a plane to flee an uprising in China. Their pilot lands somewhere without their permission to provide supplies to some militants. They take off again and I can't remember what happens next but somehow their plane crashes in the Himalayas. At the crash site they are greeted by Tibetans and are led to a place high up in the mountains called Shangrila. Shangrila is a dreamlike paradise where people age extremely slowly and there is no disease or sickness. In Shangrila there is also no worries about being unemployed, people don't fret about their loved one cheating on them and there is no competition. It is so to say, the ideal society.

Lost Horizon is the most beautiful film I know of to come out of Hollywood. If they remade it these days they would probably do a bad job. They actually did remake the film in the 70s as a musical and it was a disaster.

A theme found in the film that is especially important is the fact that the brother of the main character wants to leave Shangrila with his female companion who also wants to leave. This is representative of how some people are. Hasn't there been tons of marriages made from heaven that ended because one person in the marriage was incapable of experiencing love and happiness. Some people crave the real world with its conflict and insecurity. Not me.

I think if humanity got its act together it could create a true Shangrila, and Lost Horizon would not be just a vision, but a reality.

Unfortunately we do not have the Lost Horizon film in its entirety. Parts of it were lost with only the audio track remaining. During these parts the film is played with the video replaced with still photographs of the characters and the audio track playing. Most of the film remains though and despite this it still holds up as a cinematic classic. In the special features is also included an audio track with stills from a scene that was put in the original version of the film where the main character relates a story of his stay in Shangrila to people on a cruise ship and plays a never before heard Chopin piano composition he had learned about there.",1268179200,4,2206,4.54911838790932

Hilton and MGM weren't seeking to portray a realistic travelogue of the peoples of Tibet and lamasery life but rather to tell a wistful story of utopia. Yes, the movie has creaks and cracks to our modern eyes - it is strange to see Chinese portrayed by Westerners - but it is very much a product of its Depression era. Folks who lived in that period, who scraped and struggled to find work and keep their homes and their families intact, who had loved ones that fought and died in World War I, and who were aware of the growing militarism in Germany and Italy and what it might mean for the future - those folks would have walked out of the movie theatre wishing they too could find their Shangri-La. Only the most pedantic and socialist of those viewers would have focused on the inconsistency between the expressed utopian wish and the fact that the palatial lamasery and its inhabitants were supported by the Tibetan inhabitants of the Valley of the Blue Moon. Hey, people -this is a ""feel good"" escapist movie, not a political training film!

Those reviewers who state that Ronald Colman's (other reviewers please note this is the correct spelling of the actor's name!) performance of Foreign Consul Robert Conway was not his best should be advised that: 1) James Hilton wrote the character of Conway with Colman in mind and that 2) Colman's own daughter, Juliet Benita Colman, thought her father was playing himself. (Perhaps, therefore, those reviewers who found Mr Colman's performance not his best merely prefer the characters of Sydney Carton, Tony John, and/or Charles Rainier to the real English gentleman actor).

The opening sequence (of which I will not reveal the facts, so as not to place a spoiler in this review) was very realistic. The Chinese suffered horribly under the invasion of the Japanese in the mid-30s, a fact willingly ignored by many Westerners. Not so Robert Conway - listen to what he says to his brother after his statement regarding the saving of the Westerners in Bakul.

Parents who are concerned about the ""nude"" swimming scene of Jane Wyatt should know that the stand-in for the actress was filmed from the back, at a great distance, and in soft focus. The nude appearance is only for a second or two (the Hays Office would not have permitted more!).

In summary, I think this is a movie well-worth watching for its goals and its entertainment value. All this being said, I still want to strangle George Conway every time he appears on the screen. His character is so one-dimensional as to be a distraction every time he is before the camera.",1264723200,3,3737,6.125954198473282

1020676,5,6305416222,"More has been written about Frank Capra's 1937 production of ""Lost Horizon"" than of nearly any other film of the era, of it's unpopular pacifist message as the world prepared for WWII, of it's fanciful presentation of Asian cultures as channeled through Hollywood stereotypes, of it's ambiguous ending, to audiences expecting a simple resolution. Preview audiences in 1937 were totally confused by the film, allowing Columbia chief Harry Cohn (who hated the movie) to perform one of the most vicious 'hatchet jobs' in film history, destroying Capra's visionary work. It has taken a half-century to reassemble much of what was lost, at least in some form, and one thing, above all else, stands out...""Lost Horizon"" truly is a masterpiece, more in tune with our own time than with the world of 1937.

Modern critics love to carp upon the fact that Asians are presented in menial tasks, and Westerners are the movers and shakers in Shangri-La (with an aged Frenchman as the High Lama), but they ignore that the land was a melting pot of many races and cultures, and that in 1937, the bulk of technological advances were from the West. A melding of cultures, which had only begun a hundred years earlier, was certainly going to result in universal equality and opportunity (could you imagine Colman, Wyatt, Jaffe, or Warner's characters accepting anything less?) The argument is a silly one, anyway, more an excuse to dislike the film than a legitimate complaint. The same can be said about those who complain about the pacifist tone of the film. In a Utopian society, why would war be the biggest industry? Improving the lives and health of everyone, protecting the environment, and the pursuit of knowledge and beauty are truly noble ideals, and what was the 'rule' in Shangri-La has become essential to our survival, today, making ""Lost Horizon"" a truly visionary film.

I admit, I love the film, for many reasons, from Frank Capra's optimistic belief that good people can make a better world, to the career-defining performance by Ronald Colman, who embodied nobility and self-sacrifice better than any other actor, before or since. Dimitri Tiomkin's score sends chills down my spine, it is so beautiful! I don't find Shangri-La's architecture too 'art deco', but austere, futuristic, and universal, looking 'ahead', and not back upon the past. From the insane desperation of the opening 'China' sequence to Colman's superhuman quest at the finale to regain Shangri-La, ""Lost Horizon"" is a film I'd give SIX stars to, if I could!

I humbly recommend it to everyone!",1256256000,42,2565,5.016431924882629
1020677,3,6305416222,I have always wanted a copy of Lost Horizon.  I think they did their best to make all the sound and picture come out together but it was somewhat annoying.  I am glad I now have my copy.,1254009600,,186,3.8684210526315788
1020678,5,6305416222,"The 1937 ""Lost Horizon"" arrives to the informed viewer with a lot of baggage: originally envisioned in color, it was shot in black and white when no suitable stock footage for the mountain sequences could be found; and even in monocolor it was still Columbia's most expensive film to that point at a then-enormous $2 million budget. Capra was so unsatisfied with an initial preview of the ""3 hour"" cut (referred to by himself in his autobiography, and other sources) that he cut (only) the first two reels, supposedly burning the negative himself! Probably his decision as regards the beginning of the film was a wise one; it starts out in a quite exciting and abrupt manner and really gets us in the action, not letting up for a good half hour. Yet the DVD of the ""restored"" 132-minute cut offers plenty of evidence that other and more unfortunate deletions which involve the development of many of the secondary characters, and probably change the structure and balance of the film to the negative.

Most damaging is the fact that even this surviving and reconstructed cut is only complete in its soundtrack - just 125 minutes of visual footage survive, so stills are placed at a few points in the film as the dialog plays. And worst of all, none of the footage is from the original negative, which has probably been lost forever. At best the film looks like a grainy dupe print or a slightly fuzzy 16MM original; at worst it's quite washed out and bears little resemblance to what ace cinematographer Joseph Walker actually shot. You can get a glimpse of that by looking at the minute or two of surviving silent deleted footage that does come from the original negative - what a visual feast this must have been in 1937!

And yet for all its flaws, ""Lost Horizon"" remains a masterpiece, its director's most ambitious film and largely an artistic success. As I mentioned, it starts with a bang as British foreign officer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) and his younger brother George (John Howard) direct the evacuation of ""90 white people"" (unfortunately racist, but a comment by Robert shortly afterwards undercuts the Imperialist attitude) from the obscure northern Chinese city of Baskul, saving the last plane for themselves and three last escapees, archaelogist Alexander Lovett (Edward Everett Horton), never-named but quite-obvious prostitute Gloria Stone (Isabel Jewell) and gregarious mystery man Barnard (Thomas Mitchell). Alas they quickly find that their plane has been hijacked and instead of travelling to the coast to Shanghai they find themselves on a long flight to Tibet with no way to escape. Eventually the plane crashes on a snowy plateau, where the party is quickly (and amazingly) met by a group of Tibetans led by the English-speaking Chang (H.B. Warner).

They have crashed on the borders of Shangri-La, a remote enclave in a temperate valley amidst the most forbidding peaks, nearly impassable to even experienced mountaineers and 500 miles from the nearest settlement. Suspicions arise amongst the group that they've been deliberately brought here; George in particular seems adamant about getting answers quickly and leaving as soon as possible - but big brother Robert is of a different mind.

Colman does a beautiful job from the very first of conveying Robert Conway's world-weariness and sad, lost dream of mattering on a war-torn and violent globe. It's mentioned early on that Conway is likely to be appointed the next Foreign Secretary; it's clear that he thinks very little of this idea. In Shangri-La however, he quickly finds peace, time for reflection, beauty and simplicity in lifestyle - and beauty in the physical form of Sondra Bizet (Jane Wyatt). As Conway becomes more and more enamored of this place of peace where even disease and old age seemingly can't find a foothold, as he learns more and more about the history, the purpose, and his potential future from Chang and Father Perrault (Sam Jaffe), the 250-year-old Belgian monk who founded the place, he becomes less and less interested in returning to the mad world he left. But he cannot forget his familial duty even if he starts to dismiss his country's hold on him, and George works him around to the idea that perhaps the whole thing is a fantasy - that in fact the whole group was kidnapped, that there are sinister purposes at work - and Robert must make the choice whether to sacrifice his own happiness, or risk losing his brother forever.

Everything about ""Lost Horizon"" bespeaks a dedication and an honest hope - if not belief - in the Utopian vision that Shangri-La offers. The art direction and production design are absolutely among the best from the era, the lamasery itself is fascinatingly modern, elegant, and not seeming to belong to any style precisely, and the mountain adventure scenes are as well done as you can reasonably expect in those days of studio-bound production. Dimitri Tionkin's score is one of his very earliest and strikes the right balance of big-scale drama and otherworldly, mystical effects (the music in the pigeon sequence in particular is quite eerie and sounds to me like it makes use of electronics). The female cast seems a bit under-utilized and is less impressive than the male stars, though I think some of this does have to do with the cuts. Jewell's part in particular seems truncated - both Horton and Mitchell, admittedly two of the greatest of character actors, get a lot more to chew on - as does that of Margo, the Mexican actress who plays Maria, a Shangri-La resident who pushes and cajoles George to escape but whose own secrets will lead to no good.

But it's Colman and Capra's show overall: the actor's earnestness and ability to really act with his face more than make up for his occasional hamminess, less of a problem here than in many of his films but still not entirely absent; and Capra manages the delicate balance of keeping Shangri-La both real and wonderful and desirable, and remote, fantastic and perhaps too dreamlike to really exist. I think the difference between Capra's very best work (this, ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"" etc) and some of his slightly more problematic films (""Meet John Doe"" is a prime example) often lies in whether or not he is able to tie up the disparate strands of fantasy and reality, cynicism and sentiment, into something both believable and desirable - and he hits a home run here. After Robert has left the lamasery, finally giving in to his brother's demands, he loses both George and Maria and must make his way back to civilization alone. Cut to news headlines: ""Conway alive"", ""Conway on Way Back to England"", etc. Then, a club in London. Conway's apparently disappeared, and we get a wonderful bit in which Lord Gravesend (Hugh Butler) describes his own travails in trying to find Conway, who jumped ship on his way back home and always remains a step ahead. Finally Gravesend recounts how just a couple of days before he arrived in the most remote Tibetan village, Conway disappeared over an impassable pass, never to be seen again. ""I hope he finds his Shangri-La. I hope we all find our Shangri-Las."" The last lines, but wait...cue the rising music, a battered and frozen man, the image of the valley before him...Capraesque bells ring out.

If you have ever seen Frank Capra's 1937 B&W masterpiece on late-night, TV, you're going to enjoy this restoration which reclaims all but about 10 minutes of the lost 45.  Unfortunately, some of the original footage no longer exists, so the missing sceens are covered by some clever montages of still photos, accompanying the dialog. Following the novel's them, better than many movies, even Hilton readers should enjoy the story, even with the cinematic departures to give better flow to person-to-person dialog, and the other changes made by the screenplay writers.  Some of the restored sceens are also from rather poor masters, but the digital reclamation isn't too distracting.

I find the story-line departures from the novel acceptable to make a well-flowing screenplay.  Still, I encourage viewers to grab a copy and enjoy James Hilton's original concepts without the Hollywood departures.

Alas, my wife's favorite version is the sometime campy musical from 1973 with actors George Kenneday, John Gielgud, Sally Kellerman, Peter Finch, etc.  She loves the music.  Too bad it's not in print at this time.  The 1973 version tracks the 1937 movie, rather than trying to get even closer to the novel.

1020757,5,6305416222,"One of the great cinematic classics of a classic novel [** by James Hilton] although once again Hollywood takes ""liberties"" or so termed ""creative license"" with the original work where the cinematic rendition of the book differs from the original book itself and characters are simply added [or subtracted] for the seemingly more important ""for the sake of the plot and audience appeal"" issues. Names are even changed as well, as are other character professions. You know, the cinematic character ""Lovett"" the ""palaeontologist"" is nowhere to be found in the original novel and the lone female character [on the plane] moves from a missionary [in the book] to a running away from the world prostitute in the movie.

Why are these modifications made!

"" bonus featurettes on the DVD the producer comes right out and says that while the book is indeed a ""classic of great literature"" and advises viewers to ""read the book"", he then continues, ""It just doesn't make for a good 'cinematic' representation of the plot [!] [...] and audience appeal [!] is a factor that must be considered with regard to plot or plot endings and therefore certain ""creative liberties"" [! -- Oh-Oh! Watch out for 'that' one!] are taken for a better 'cinematic' result."" Translation: The original author's work is very often tinkered with or modified either in part or in whole [especially when new characters suddenly show up 'for the sake of the plot'] if the 'cinematic' portrayal makes for a better [!] presentation than the original book. Or classic therein.

That all said, I liked the cinematic version and I thought the portrayal of ""Robert Conway"" by Ronald Colman [** Note! It's ""Colman"", and 'not' ""Coleman""] was excellent casting [fess up now, the 'cinematic' version and the whole cloth manufacturing of Conway's brother, George, talk about the brother being a, and quickly borrowing a word from the cinematic Conway, a ""babbling"" liability from the get-go, whew!] -- his reaction [George] and without giving away what happens even tho' this movie has been around since the mid 30's, anyway, George's reaction to seeing 'Marie' and her 'face' outside of Shangri La was almost expected as the guy seemed to react poorly [some would say 'flakey'] to virtually everything in the movie that didn't involve finding porters to get out of the place!]. I thought Sam Jaffe [a few years later rendering a superb performance as ""Gunga Din"" in '39] did a great job as the High Lama and our good friend 'Chang' with his quiet intelligence and rather personable demeanor.

As for 'Shangri La' itself, well, it seems to me that each person has their own idea(s) on what constitutes same but as a dyed in the wool realist 'and' considering the greatest enigma of them all, human nature, I'm not sure that any idealist envisioned 'utopia' would ever be possible and the 'best' that the species can at least hope for are protracted periods of peace and to the extent 'humanly/humanely' [!] possible. Recall even in the movie version of ""Lost Horizon"" when Sondra [** Jane Wyatt] says about the outside world she's never seen, "" ... Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy ..."" and Conway comments, albeit quite realistically so, ""Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long."" [sic] That's a dose of stark reality! And the unpredictability of human nature and human behavior therein. And, I'll add at once, as the historical record itself [and over the centuries] so readily demonstrates.

In the utopia(Shangri-la) the Western group was eventally led into, Asians were a group of faceless labors who seemed to enjoy the actually despotic rule of the High Lama and his agent Mr. Chang.

Obviously the characters don't have to do any job there but can still have fun and free meal--certainly they start to like it there. It is said in the movie that people living there don't use money, but that doesn't mean that nobody has to work: think about those local labors.

This masterful suspense story of an airplane kidnapping and its eventual landing in the fictional city of Shangri-la in the Himalayas offers up timeless questions such as What is the meaning of life and How do we want to spend our time here on earth.

Eastern mystical philosophy is contrasted with the materialism of the west while characterizations of the more mellow Asians are juxtaposed with the often self-absorbed Britishers. Amongst the spectacular and surprising architecture of the spiritual city, we find ourselves asking: Mightn't I incorporate more seeking of Shangri-la in my own life?

Instead of purchasing this film which includes the fascinating behind-the-scenes story of its creation (selection of Sam Jaffe for the role of head monk, plus tension between director Frank Capra and producer Harry Cohen) donate the money to a charity of your choice!",1199664000,,1063,5.247058823529412
1020839,5,6305416222,"""Lost Horizon"", made at enormous expense by the famous Frank Capra in 1936, was based on a popular novel by James Hilton. It tells the story of a group of plane crash survivors who discover heaven on earth in Shangri-La, a word which entered the English language to mean a place of eternal happiness. The film has a timeless quality and Ronald Colman warmly fleshes out the leading character, a professional soldier and diplomat who has been summoned to Shangri-La to replace its dying leader the Hi-lama. Colman's talent is what makes the film work. He is a charismatic hero. Jane Wyatt, most famous as the wife in the TV show ""Father Knows Best"", plays opposite Colman as the resident of Shangri-La with whom he falls in love. Wyatt is fresh and natural which helps her credibility in an almost impossible role. Her love scene with Colman in the garden is memorable. The story has a lot to say about the state of the world and this was timely in 1937.

The film was a controversial production. It ran way over budget, costing Columbia studios an enormous proportion of their annual budget. It took years to earn back its costs and Capra scrapped the first 2 reels after a disastrous preview. The film was subsequently cut in 1937 from 132 to 116 minutes for rural distribution and then cut further to 108 minutes for re-release during the war. Due to the committed efforts of the American Film Institute and a world wide search for prints, this DVD contains the complete soundtrack of the original 132 minute version with 7 minutes of missing screen time reconstructed from stills. The reconstruction varies in quality depending on the quality of the source material itself. All of this information is recorded in a terrific documentary which also recreates using stills the reels which Capra discarded and other cuts made along the way. The material gives a fascinating insight into the construction of the film and the director's conclusions concerning what was commercial and what was not. Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Studios, also demanded some costly retakes.

The DVD also contains a worthwhile commentary about the film itself, deleted scenes and an alternate ending which was changed within a few weeks of the release. This is an outstanding package and no viewer could not fail to become intrigued by the reconstruction as the search for the remaining 7 minutes of film continues.",1197936000,6,2396,4.8557457212713935
1020840,5,6305416222,"Frank Capra's LOST HORIZON, based on the bestselling novel by James Hilton, is truly one of the milestones of modern fantasy cinema.  The cast is impeccable, the sets inspired, and audience fascination for the material has only increased throughout the years.  This DVD presents the film complete and restored to it's original 132 minute theatrical running-time.

British diplomat Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) and a group of planecrash survivors find salvation in Shangri-La, a utopian civilisation nestled in the Himalayan mountains.  The peaceful mantra of the Shangri-La community soon wins over the jaded members of the rescued party, and Robert finds tender romance with Sondra (Jane Wyatt).  But the peace is shattered by Robert's hostile brother George (John Howard), and his suspicious mind.

LOST HORIZON is filled with wonderful performances.  The planecrash survivors are played with great skill by Edward Everett Horton, Isabel Jewell and Thomas Mitchell; with a finely-understated and regal Sam Jaffe playing Shangri-La's mythical High Lama.  H.B. Warner also has a great presence as Chang, and the seldom-remembered Margo Albert plays George's scheming girlfriend Maria.

Ronald Colman and Jane Wyatt's performances lie at the very heart of LOST HORIZON.  Their romance provides the base from which the entire story pivots; and I can't think of a better actress to play the lovely Sondra than Jane Wyatt.  She is absolute perfection here.

LOST HORIZON has had a very checkered past.  When originally released in 1937, it's running time was a hefty 132 minutes.  That was quickly cut down to 118 minutes for it's General Release; and further trimmed to 108 minutes in certain prints.  During World War II, LOST HORIZON was re-released as ""Lost Horizon of Shangri-La"", running 95 minutes with the opening titles changed to implicate Japan into the plot.  TV prints were utilised from the WWII reissue, and the full-length version was never heard from again.

This new DVD version presents the complete, uncut LOST HORIZON for the very first time since 1937.  The UCLA Film and Television Archive spent 25 years researching, restoring and gathering all possible materials to introduce audiences to director Frank Capra's original vision.  The final product is sensational, displaying the beautiful Art Deco designs of Stephen Goosson, the haunting score of Dimitri Tiomkin, and of course the tender performances of Ronald Colman and Jane Wyatt.

DVD extra features include newly-discovered deleted scenes, audio commentary by UCLA restorer Robert Gitt and film historian Charles Champlin, photo documentary narrated by film historian Kendall Miller, the alternate 1941 reissue titles, alternate ending, and restoration comparison.",1191628800,13,2743,5.485714285714286

1020842,4,6305416222,"In 1933, when James Hilton's utopian novel LOST HORIZON was published, the threat of the world again at war was such that novel about finding a hidden and peaceful paradise could become a bestseller in the United Kingdom and the United States (it was, incidentally, the first contemporary novel to become a Penguin paperback because of its popularity). It was inevitable that it would become a movie, and Frank Capra was probably the ideal person to direct it, given his interest in happy endings and his previous film on war-torn China THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN. His 1937 LOST HORIZON evokes that earlier film in its superbly suspenseful opening scenes on a Chinese airfield as its city is overrun by invaders. These early scenes and the subsequent sequence on a hijacked plane (which Steven Spielberg clearly did homage to in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM) and the subsequent sequence with the pane's crashing in the Himalayas, and the passengers making passage through the mountainous waste to the hidden haven of Shangri-La, are about as fine as anything Capra ever did in terms of sheer suspense, and could scarcely have been bettered. It's only once we get to Shangri-la itself--which, as Graham Greene famously noted, looks like a film star's Beverly Hills mansion--that the film runs into trouble. The tedious scenes with Sam Jaffe as the High Lama passing on wisdom to the film's hero (Ronald Colman) are just about insufferable, and paradise hardly seems the best topic for a film (it inevitably looks pretty boring, as Shangri-La does here). But Colman and the rest of the cast are in fine form; few directors could get such consistently strong and naturalistic work out of their actors as could Capra. Colman is superb, as are John Howard (as his dissatisfied brother George) and Margo (as a Russian woman eager to leave Shangri-la); Jane Wyatt does a fine job with the awful role of Sondra, who was born and raised in the mountain enclave, and she gets a sexy nude swimming sequence that must have been inspired by Hedy Lamarr's work a few years earlier in ECSATSY.

The film was notoriously and fatally trimmed soon after its release, but eventually the entire soundtrack was restored and most of the missing film sequences; those few sections still missing the actual film footage are allowed to run with the soundtrack and stills to show what happened. The cinematography is excellent. Much of the outdoor scenes in the Himalayas were clipped from the German Bergenfilms on the 30s, but Capra at least had the wisdom to steal from the best: some of the shots are absolutely breathtaking, especially given their age.",1185753600,9,2642,4.897321428571429

1020844,5,6305416222,"If you're bored with the notion of Shrek 329 or Mission Impossible 741 -  if you're looking for something more challenging in movies than special effects, then you may be in the market for Frank Capra's ""Lost Horizon"", made in 1937.  The 1930s generated more movie classics than almost any period in motion picture history - either before or since.  In that context, make no mistake, Lost Horizon is not just a classic, it is a movie masterpiece.

In one interview, Frank Capra remarked that one of the most difficult things to achieve in film was to make the passing of time and distance plausible for the movie viewer.  It was Capra's mastery of making time and distance pass, coupled with his innate sense of understanding of human nature, that made him a genius, and nowhere was this better exemplified than in Lost Horizon.  The film completely draws you in.  It takes you on an extraordinary journey which begins with a plane flight that spirits you away from a war weary world to the utopian world of Shangri-La. Ultimately, the film is a metaphoric exploration of what happens to different people when they are exposed to utopia - some have the intellect to understand that it is what they have been seeking; some refuse to accept it; some adapt to it and some learn to embrace it.

The cast will be familiar to Frank Capra fans and includes H.B. Warner as Chang(brilliant); Thomas Mitchell (outstanding), and of course the charismatic Ronald Colman (also brilliant).  The high-lama, played by Sam Jaffe, is extraordinary.  The sets are visually stunning; the movie is haunting, enchanting and intellectually challenging.  One of its characters ultimately summarizes the possibility of Shangri-La's existence with the statement  ""...I believe it because I choose to believe it...""  After you have seen Lost Horizon, you may also choose to believe it.  Buy the movie, don't rent it - this isn't Shrek or Mission Impossible - this is something you will treasure and will watch over and over again.",1180915200,4,2003,4.887573964497041

I think that's what draws most people to this movie; the idea of an ultimate Utopian society.  The special features are also an added bonus.  What really struck me about this was the one conversation Conway has with the High Lama.  Now I have probably seen this movie one time since high school and didn't remember it very well. But, the High Lama is talking about all the problems in the world, and how mankind is going to destroy itself.  The remnants of humanity will then want their knowledge and the people of Shangri-la will be there to greet them and help them.  The chilling part of the whole thing is how much it sounds lilke what is happening today.  The ultimate message is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.

1020887,5,6305416222,"If you enjoy movies similar to Seven Years in Tibet or any movie featuring faraway fantasy escapes where mankind seeks peace, then this movie might interest you.

Lost Horizon is not the lavish classic it once was. Strangely enough, a movie about people who lived for 200 years was not protected or preserved properly and Robert Gitt's restored version is an extraordinary accomplishment. Robert Gitt worked for over 25 years to find enough footage to restore missing scenes.

The dramatic start and the confusion of the first few scenes draw you into the movie and then a surprisingly leisurely-paced plot keeps your attention to the last second. As a plane takes off by the light of the burning hangers, a few lives have been saved while the fate of those left behind is not really discussed. Once aboard, they realize this plane is flying in the wrong direction. To make matters worse, the plane crashes in the mountains and leaves the passengers stranded in the bitter cold.

Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) is almost unnaturally calm in the face of certain death and throughout the movie he displays the qualities of a hero who is faced with difficult choices. At first he is a captive of Shangri-La's choices and then later he puts his life at risk to follow his destiny.

I did love when Conway said: ""Not knowing where you are going is exciting..."" Conway wastes no time anguishing over the unpredictability of life and is a great example of how we can stay calm in the adventure of life itself. I saw this movie as a metaphor for everyone who is seeking an escape from the conflicts of our planetary existence. In a way, the message in Lost Horizon reminded me of the messages in the movie Camelot.

The ideas of how we are killing ourselves with ""indirect suicide"" are still very relevant for today. Walking for 30 minutes and then practicing yoga for 70 minutes is sure to dissolve mountains of stress. If you do that before watching this movie, it can only help to dissolve even more stress. Yoga (a meditation of the body and not a religion) definitely makes you feel and look younger than your age.

The romance in this movie is quite mild and I actually preferred the alternate and more dramatic ending. There are a few flaws in the Shangri-La philosophy of life. How could anyone be happy giving away the woman they loved? While the heart may want peace, the heart may prefer conflict in such cases. It does seem that at times we humans thrive on inner conflicts and external controversy.

We are born for the struggle, but Shangri-La definitely sounds like an interesting vacation escape, just don't make me live there without computers. ;) There are ways to find inner peace and I assume that if everyone did yoga, no one would have any time to start wars because they would be floating in some blissful state that is difficult to explain, but very real.

1020889,5,6305416222,"A group of people board a plane expecting to escape from a violent China. Without their knowledge, a man hijacks the plane and takes them in the opposite direction, toward trecherous Chinese areas. Soon, the plan runs out of fuel, and everyone is wrecked in a frozen, mountainous region with little hope. Soon, a caravan of foreigners who speak English find them and take them to their home, Shangri-la. Shangri-la is a place like no other, a wonderful Utopia where all men have regard for each other and where treasures from all over the world reside. Of the group, only one feels truly comfortable there from the start, a writer whose subjects often include a Utopian society (Ronald Colman). The others are anxious to leave, feeling uncomfortable with the strange way the natives live.

The philosophies presented here are very similar to the Capra ideal present in all his films. Hope is capital above everything else. The people in Shangri-la are aware of the hardships of humanity present elsewhere in the world and have vowed to live peaceful, Christian lives hidden away. They hope to preserve the good parts of life so that it will available when all else is destroyed.

Strangely, this talkie has several sequences that are lost due to deterioration, a wonderful example of the need to obey the philosophies in the film. Even if the public as a whole has little interest in the treasures of the world no matter how old they are, it is the duty of those who understand their importance to preserve them for the future in hopes that someday they will be fully appreciated. Thankfully, the soundtrack to the film is complete, so the areas where film is missing are padded with film stills.

1020890,5,6305416222,"This is a superb, academy award winning film, directed by the late, great Frank Capra. Based upon James Hilton's book of the same name, it is as fresh today as it was nearly sixty five years ago, when it was first released in 1937.

The film opens up in Baskul, China, somewhere near the Tibetan border in 1935, where a minor revolution appears to be occuring, and foreigners are being evacuated. A world weary and dashing diplomat, Robert Conway, magnificently played by the ever handsome, melliflously voiced Ronald Colman, is directing the evacuation efforts. He, his brother George, and three others, two men and one woman, manage to board the last plane out of this rife torn area of China. Unbeknownst to them, their pilot has been overcome by another person, who comandeers the plane.

They finally realize something in wrong when they notice that the plane is traveling west instead of east. Moreover, they are unable to do anything about it, as no one on board, other than the pilot, can fly a plane. They seem to be flying in the Himalyan region, as they are surrounded by snow capped peaks, flying at an altitude of about 21,000 feet. Suddenly, their plane lands in the mountains, the pilot dead at the controls. Strangely enough, they are met by a crowd of people, as if they were expected. At their head is a Mr. Chang, a very dignified gentleman, masterfully played by W.B. Warner, who provides them with appropriate clothing for a high altitude climb through a very daunting and precarious mountain pass. Fortuitously for all, Mr. Chang speaks English beautifully.

After a seeming death defying trek through the mountains, in what appear to be blizzard conditions, they arrive at a beautiful and peaceful valley protected from inclement weather. They have now reached the mythical and utopian kingdom of Shangri-La. It is here that Robert Conway meets Saundra, the woman of his dreams, played by a very young and beautiful Jane Wyatt. It is love at first sight.

He also discovers that his plane was comandeered with the express purpose of bringing him to Shangri-La, as it is the wish of their dying leader, Padre Perro, a Belgian priest, played with saintly spirituality by Sam Jaffee, that Conway should be the new leader of this utopian paradise, where people seem to live long, very long, lives. Touched by the saintliness of Padre Perro and in love with the beauty and peace he sees and feels all around him, Conway is very much interested in remaining. It is as if he had finally found that for which he had been searching all his life.

His brother, George, however, has no wish to stay, the only one of those who were on board the plane who feels that way. An attractive young woman whom he met in this idyllic spot, and who has fallen for George, professes to want to leave, as well. Together the two of them persuade Robert to leave. Giving in to them out of a sense of obligation, he leaves with them, but what happens on the way back to the world that they knew, convinces Robert that he must return to Shangri-La and the woman he loves, at any cost. What happens next will not disappoint.

This film is a masterpiece that keeps the viewer enthralled. While some of the events that occur during the film are higly improbable, that does not dampen the enthusiasm that one is sure to develop for this well made movie. It is, without a doubt, a cinematic classic.",1160179200,3,3389,4.668341708542713
1020891,5,6305416222,"James Hilton's novel was fashioned by a young Frank Capra in the 1930's into this flawed but must-see film classic. Robert Riskin's screenplay is too preachy at times, with less emphasis on the romance than there should have been, but an exciting finish and terrific individual moments make this a great film anyway.

Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) is in the Chinese city of Baskul in 1935 when the film opens, evacuating the Americans by plane during the revolution. He is a man who sees the big picture, however, and though in line for advancement to Foreign Secretary, cannot get around the many Chinese sure to die as the last plane takes off.

Onboard is his his brother George (John Howard), a dying young woman of loose virtue named Gloria (Isabel Jewell), stuffy Lovett (Edward Everett Horton), and Thomas Mitchell as Barnard, an easygoing fellow on the run from the law. What they all have in common is they are all in the same boat, or rather plane, as the case may be, as they soon discover their pilot is dead and a Mongolian is flying them to an unknown destination deep in the mountains of Tibet.

Their journey has only just begun once they crash land in the snow, however, apparently all part of a plan. They meet Chang (H.B. Warner) and his party, who will guide them over a treacherous pass sure to kill many until they reach a paradise-like garden city deep in the Valley of the Blue Moon they all call Shangri-la. It is almost unreal, cut off from the rest of civilization. There is peace and harmony there, the kind Robert writes about in his books.

Robert will soon discover that it is those books which has brought him here. Jane Wyatt is young and lovely as Sondra. It is she who has read them and saw in Robert a lost soul who might possibly find a home in Shangri-la. The rest of the group, however, are intent on being rescued and brought back to ""civilization."" Conway is at home here in this magical place with no need for doctors, no crime, and no communication with the outside world. He soon meets the Belgian priest who began the colony and discovers him to be over 200 years old.

It isn't long before Barnard and ""Lovey"" become ensconsed in Shangri-la and become pals, despite their original animosity. The sick and painted-up Gloria is soon restored to good health, prettier without the make-up. Lovey will begin teaching the children and find his true calling. And Barnard will use his experience as a plumber to draw up designs for water transport to the remote valley.

But Robert's brother George is weak and wants out. He finds that same restless spirit in the exotic Russian girl, Maria (Margo), who says Shangri-la is all a lie. It will cast a seed of doubt in Robert's heart which will either delay his acceptance as the new leader of Shangri-la or destroy it forever. Sondra desperately races after him with only Chang's reassurance that he will return any comfort to her broken heart.

While some stills are used sparingly during some brief moments of missing footage, it is not what mars this Capra classic. Rather, it is Riskin's talky screenplay. While it often worked to good advantage in Capra's social comedies, it gives this film, wonderful as it is, a cerebral feel. What lifts it back up is the romance.

Joseph Walker's cinematography is lush and romantic. Nearly out of the blue, as though they belonged in a Frank Borzage film rather than a Capra one, are scenes between Colman and Wyatt so filled with romance they are like a rainbow cast over the Valley of the Blue Moon. Wyatt is pure and lovely in a swimming scene and she and Colman's moments of happiness while he tries to grasp it all are never to be forgotten. It is that human romance, in addition to the romantic notion that perhaps we each still have a chance to find our own Shangri-la, and someone to share it with, that make this a must-see film for true film buffs.",1159142400,7,3888,4.5922190201729105
1020892,5,6305416222,"The impact of this work over the years has been considerable. James Hilton wrote the novel as an anti-war ideal. Hilton was an intelligent man and saw what was coming for the world in the 30's and tried to create an imaginary place of ease, cultural pursuits and knowledge free from the toil and terrors of the world, especially death itself. It became a great novel in the history of fiction. The book became really big after pocket books produced the FIRST paperback and made this work the object of that new development. Then Capra made the monumental movie that we have all come to appreciate, once again, prophetic about the coming war and suggestive of continuance after humanity is done tearing each other apart. Yet, it was NOT finished, the spirit continued into World War II,after the first daring bombing of Tokyo, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt told the press that the source of the bombers came ""from our secret base in Shangri-La Gentlemen!"". With this in mind, Father Perot continues to deliver the message of ""Be kind"" to this day and Shangri-La is carried into every human mind that understands the basic philosophy behind this picture. Of course, since it was made in the 30's, it is somewhat dated now in characterizations, which remind you of Flash Gordon serials done at a slightly slower pace. Coleman reminds us of the cynical attitude we take as we roll with the punches that life throws upon us. When you get to this point, usually somewhere in your 40's, you are ready to throw in everything for just a chance at Shangri-La. Escape from the toils of the world into a physical ideal place is of course, a set in the imagination of writers, even Evelyn Waugh's Charles Ryder in 'Brideshead Revisited"" (1945) sought ""that low door in the wall that opened to an enchanted garden, where others I knew had gone before me, not overlooked by any window in that gray city"". Our nature is like a restless Henry David Thoreau in ""Walden"" or a wandering Walt Whitman in ""Leaves of Grass"", always seeking that magic place where we will finally be able to sleep without worry. THIS is Shangri-La. It is part of the American Spirit and that is why this movie is such an important picture despite it's faults. Capra spent a lot on this production. Young people need to see it and understand that famous quote ""those who do not learn from History are doomed to repeat it"". Once again, forms of Fascism are on the Horizon. The ""Lost"" Horizon may be our own if we fail to communicate this to future generations. Let us hope that we can build Shangi-La in reality someday as more than just an ideal in our imagination.",1158969600,7,2629,4.655913978494624

1020894,5,6305416222,"This is my favorite Capra film.  It's so beguiling, gentle, and incredibly sincere.  The film's opening sequences are genuinely terrifying.  It makes you feel like you're in a foreign country falling apart.  The scenes where they get to Shangri-La, well, I really don't have words to convey the feelings that I feel.  You actually feel the place exists.  It's not a pipe dream (to quote Eugene O'Neill), but a real dream.  The opening text talks about a time of wars and rumours of wars, don't we all wish for a Shangri-La?  Sounds like that could be at anytime in the history of mankind.  Capra directs this film magnificently, getting superlative performances from Ronald Coleman, Thomas Mitchell (one of the greatest character actors ever), Margo, and Edward Everett Horton.  It's Capra's most mystical film.  The restoration, for the most part, is excellent.  There are some stills where the picture was lost (but they have all the sound).  This is a little off-putting at first, but there's not much of it.  Thankfully, the film has survived, otherwise we'd be stuck with the remake (which was supposed to be one of the worst films ever made).",1153785600,4,1148,4.880829015544041
1020895,5,6305416222,"This is a superb, academy award winning film, directed by the late, great Frank Capra. Based upon James Hilton's book of the same name, it is as fresh today as it was nearly sixty five years ago, when it was first released in 1937.

The film opens up in Baskul, China, somewhere near the Tibetan border in 1935, where a minor revolution appears to be occuring, and foreigners are being evacuated. A world weary and dashing diplomat, Robert Conway, magnificently played by the ever handsome, melliflously voiced Ronald Colman, is directing the evacuation efforts. He, his brother George, and three others, two men and one woman, manage to board the last plane out of this rife torn area of China. Unbeknownst to them, their pilot has been overcome by another person, who comandeers the plane.

They finally realize something in wrong when they notice that the plane is traveling west instead of east. Moreover, they are unable to do anything about it, as no one on board, other than the pilot, can fly a plane. They seem to be flying in the Himalyan region, as they are surrounded by snow capped peaks, flying at an altitude of about 21,000 feet. Suddenly, their plane lands in the mountains, the pilot dead at the controls. Strangely enough, they are met by a crowd of people, as if they were expected. At their head is a Mr. Chang, a very dignified gentleman, masterfully played by W.B. Warner, who provides them with appropriate clothing for a high altitude climb through a very daunting and precarious mountain pass. Fortuitously for all, Mr. Chang speaks English beautifully.

After a seeming death defying trek through the mountains, in what appear to be blizzard conditions, they arrive at a beautiful and peaceful valley protected from inclement weather. They have now reached the mythical and utopian kingdom of Shangri-La. It is here that Robert Conway meets Saundra, the woman of his dreams, played by a very young and beautiful Jane Wyatt. It is love at first sight.

He also discovers that his plane was comandeered with the express purpose of bringing him to Shangri-La, as it is the wish of their dying leader, Padre Perro, a Belgian priest, played with saintly spirituality by Sam Jaffee, that Conway should be the new leader of this utopian paradise, where people seem to live long, very long, lives. Touched by the saintliness of Padre Perro and in love with the beauty and peace he sees and feels all around him, Conway is very much interested in remaining. It is as if he had finally found that for which he had been searching all his life.

His brother, George, however, has no wish to stay, the only one of those who were on board the plane who feels that way. An attractive young woman whom he met in this idyllic spot, and who has fallen for George, professes to want to leave, as well. Together the two of them persuade Robert to leave. Giving in to them out of a sense of obligation, he leaves with them, but what happens on the way back to the world that they knew, convinces Robert that he must return to Shangri-la and the woman he loves, at any cost. What happens next will not disappoint.

This film is a masterpiece that keeps the viewer enthralled. While some of the events that occur during the film are higly improbable, that does not dampen the enthusiasm that one is sure to develop for this well made movie. It is, without a doubt, a cinematic classic.",1147651200,3,3389,4.668341708542713

A subtle, sensitive, intelligent fantasy adventure.",1125878400,6,422,5.609375
1020953,4,6305416222,"One of my favorite books growing up was James Hilton's classic 1933 book, ""Lost Horizon"", and I believe it motivated a great deal of my current wanderlust. Even though I have had the misfortune of seeing the disastrous 1973 musical remake when I was young, the original 1937 film adaptation has been a film I have wanted to see for years, but for whatever reason, it was next to impossible to uncover. Apparently, bastardized versions have shown up on TV through the years. Now we are fortunate to have this 1999 restoration spearheaded by UCLA film archivist Robert Gitt to match as closely as possible to Frank Capra's original 132-minute running time.

Similar to what was done with George Cukor's ""A Star Is Born"", ""Lost Horizon"" is presented with its complete soundtrack, but missing footage had to be found through other sources, even 16-mm prints recorded from TV broadcasts, and in a few scenes, production stills were sadly the only option to fill in the gaps. Consequently, there is a variable quality to the print, but when one thinks that much of this footage could have been completely lost, the visual lapses are more than forgivable. Now that I have seen Capra's vision of the book, I can now understand why it's a cinematic classic though I have to concede not as timeless as one would hope.

The fanciful plot centers on Robert Conway, a top-level English diplomat about to become the Foreign Secretary, who helps refugees and assorted others from war-ravaged China. A motley crew of passengers led by Conway boards a plane that is skyjacked toward the Himalayas where it crash lands in a desolate spot of Tibet. They are eventually met by a sect of locals who takes them to a paradise called Shangri-La. The focus of the story then becomes how each of the plane survivors responds to this utopian existence. With his instantly recognizable mellifluous tone, Ronald Colman is perfectly cast as Conway, the only one who embraces this seemingly perfect haven from the outset. He captures the natural curiosity and open romanticism of his character with his trademark erudite manner.

The rest of the cast is a gallery of stock characters fleshed out by the variable quality of the performances. H.B. Warner plays Chang with the requisite serenity of his vague, mysterious character; and Jane Wyatt - two decades before playing the perfect suburban wife and mother in ""Father Knows Best"" - is surprisingly saucy as Sondra, the young schoolteacher who has Conway brought to Shangri-La. She even has a brief nude swimming scene. John Howard unfortunately overplays the thankless role of Conway's obstreperous brother George to the point where I groan every time he appears onscreen. A similar feeling comes over me when I see Edward Everett Horton's overly pixilated and fey turn as Lovett and Sam Jaffe's bug-eyed, ethereal High Lama. Isabel Jewell and Thomas Mitchell fare better as a dying prostitute and a fugitive swindler, respectively.

The set designs for the Shangri-La lamasery by Stephen Goossn are intriguing in that they look like a post-modern tribute to Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie architecture, though one could argue that the exteriors also resemble a fancy Miami Beach resort hotel. I also imagine that the isolationist philosophy espoused by the High Lama may have been at odds with pre-WWII patriotic fervor, though the more lingering problem is the racism apparent in the casting (e.g., non-Asians like Warner playing inscrutable Asians) and the portrayal of the Tibetan porters as gun-toting derelicts. However, for all its flaws, the movie has some really stunning camerawork by Joseph Walker, surprisingly masterful special effects (for a near-poverty row studio like Columbia), Dmitri Tiomkin's stirring musical score and a powerful sense of mysticism that gives the film a genuine soul. It is no accident that Capra, the most idealistic of the master filmmakers, helmed this movie because a more cynical mindset could have easily sabotaged the entire venture.

The DVD is a wonderful package. First, there is a fascinating photo montage documentary with narration provided by film historian Kendall Miller, which gives a true feeling of how Capra approached the production. Gitt and film critic Charles Champlin provide audio commentary on an alternate track of the film with Gitt very informative about the exhaustive restoration process and Champlin more in awe of the result. There is even an alternative ending included that Columbia chief Harry Cohn insisted on filming and using upon release, but it had thankfully been dropped two weeks later. This is a genuine treat for cinemaphiles, as there are few films that make such a compelling case for seeking out one's personal utopia.",1122768000,44,4726,5.085051546391752
1020954,5,6305416222,"The Lost Horizon is a truly amazing film. In 1937, with wars and rumors of war and the world filled with evil ideologies, it preached the simple message of ""Be kind."" Ronald Colman as Bob Conway epitomizes the dream of every ""good man"", to soothe the savageness of society and make gentle life of this world. Bob Conway is the essence of idealism. He sees things that never were, and asks ""Why not."" Colman was never better. Jane Wyatt was beautiful. This should be required viewing for all of the world's leaders. May we all find our Shangri La some day.",1121904000,11,555,4.5049504950495045
1020955,5,6305416222,"I first came into contact with Lost Horizon when I found the DVD in a video store. It was a very moving and delightful surprise. I then read the book which I also recommend highly. I had heard of ""Shangri-La"" and knew it was one of the classic utopias. I knew President Roosevelt had named his retreat Shangri-La (later renamed by President Eisenhower Camp David after his grandson). But I had never connected the retreat to the novel or film.

I found the film beautiful, compelling - it stirred me emotionally.

There were some serious flaws in Hilton's utopia. All the servants were Asian. There were no white people who were servants. The English and Americans in the film thought nothing of being served by Asians; they obviously believed it was the ""natural order.""
Second, in the film, men ""gave up"" women that they loved/desired for the sake of good manners, yet no one asked the woman if she wanted to be given up! (In the book, however, it is clearly stated that there are no ""sex distinctions"" in Shangri-La and indicates that women WOULD be consulted before being relinquished. Phew!)

Hilton's vision was clearly flawed. Yet, I believe that ALL of our visions of eutopia are shaped by our time, and our culture. The very  obvious racism in the film and in the book is hard to take, as is the idea that women are property to be given up or traded. I hope that we have advanced in our vision of eutopia, but in 70 years we may find that our vision was as limited by our upbringing and education as was the vision of the filmmakers in the first half of the 20th century.

The film is terribly romantic (Amazon's official review says it is ""foolish."" No doubt the reviewer would call Gandhi foolish).

The film is romantic in that it envisions a different reality than war, poverty, strife, and mean-spiritedness. It embodies the hope that some day our whole world might embrace peace, courtesy, generosity, moderation and kindness. It is a dream that many of us are unwilling to give up.

Ronald Colman is an amazingly effective romantic hero (I loved him in the Prisoner of Zenda). Jane Wyatt is a truly lovely woman. Her acting, her grace, and her melodious voice contributes to the suspension of disbelief necessary for a great film.

Every time her character appears in the film you hear beautiful music... I had assumed that it was part of the sound track. Then her character explains that she has added flutes to pigeons' tails, and the pigeons follow her, as does the wonderful music.

(One reason that I didn't like the commentary is that the guy Champlin? was patronizing and trivializing...I didn't care for his reference to Jane Wyatt in Father Knows Best..I thought it might be fun to point out her role as Spock's mother (Amanda) in Star Trek....beautiful, graceful and embodying virtues that everyone's mother should have)

Sam Jaffe was incredibly believable as the High Lama...wow! What an amazing performance, and to think he was almost replaced! He says
""Look at the world today. Is there anything more pitiful? What madness there is! What blindness! What unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, compelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here, we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be kind.""

I loved the relationship between the flawed stockbroker and the woman who had been trapped in prostitution......The score by Smitri Tiomkin was wonderful -- eerie, compelling and peaceful.

On the down side, the younger brother was terribly miscast.

I was quite interested by the timing of the film. The ""Great War"" had left many, many people who wanted peace. There was a tremendous surge of pacifism, and hatred of war. Yet during WW II, the character Conway's pacifist speech in the airplane (when they were taken to Shangri-La) was deleted.

I highly recommend this movie to all idealists and dreamers....

1020956,4,6305416222,"First, the enjoyable. It's a happy, pastoral Utopia where people seem to live for centuries, if not forever. The wise leaders know of the outside world, and learn the best it has to offer, but keep their silence. Interlopers from outside come, some with spotty backgrounds, and they too become peaceful citizens with contributions to make. One among them is the one chosen to lead this land through the world's coming dark age, and ... well, see the rest.

To keep the movie flowing, not a lot is presented about the social structure of this heaven-on-earth. They do have nice clothes and huge castles. They also have butlers that look a whole lot like something from a Victorian men's club. They also have an Asian-looking peasant class and a very European ruling/leisure class, even though this is somewhere in Tibet. They also have gold, lots of it - not very useful here but it helps with those pesky trade issues.

OK, this is a watching movie, not a thinking movie. It's watchable, it presents all the right icons of a wonderful place, as the director imagined that the 1930s white-bread audience imagined it. Let a few incongruities get past you, and the basic idea is a hope for living a peaceful, useful life. There are lots worse.

1020957,4,6305416222,"James Hilton's source novel is a perfect marriage to the idealist sensibilities of director Frank Capra.  The film concerns itself with a group of Westerners escaping war-ravaged China whose plane is deliberately diverted to a closed-off society where there is no greed or avarice and time seems to stand still.  This film must have been the perfect tonic for audiences who were reeling from the after effects of the Great Depression and leery of the forboding Axis power grab.  The film is sumptuously designed and filmed and has a great score by Dmitri Tiomkin.  The cast is uniformly solid with a strong lead performance by Ronald Colman and good support by veterans Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, and Sam Jaffe.  A quibble I have is the film does beat into the ground it's message of love and mutual respect, but that may be my own cynicism.  Another quibble is that the denizens of Shangri-La are predominately Asian yet it's most prominent citizen, Mr. Chang is played by an Anglo(Warner).  It's also convenient that the love interests for Colman and co-star John Howard are played by the only two Western women in Shangri-La, Jane Wyatt and Margo.",1110067200,2,1176,4.909090909090909

1020959,5,6305416222,"One of the all time great four hanky tearjerkers, ""Random Harvest"" (1942) is a bittersweet tale of love and sacrifice, set against that mythical backdrop of jolly ol' Britain that never was. It stars Ronald Colman as Charles Rainier, a war veteran who is suffering from amnesia. Paula Ridgway (Greer Garson) is the unfortunate dance-hall hostess who falls in love and marries Charles - renamed John Smith. But true love never runs a straight course and John and Paula's brief chance at divine happiness is overturned when a car accident jogs John's memory. He returns to the life he once knew, oblivious that his new and fragile world with Paula ever existed.
Colman's gentlemanly congeniality, as always, astounds with genuine canter and frank grace and maturity - qualities soarly lacking from the leading men of today's cinema. Garson is charming; blowing in as a summer's breeze and just as passionate, divine and charming as Colman. Director Mervyn LeRoy modulates each plot point and circumstance with subtle panache and quiet rectitude for his subject matter. There's never a point at which the melodrama becomes cheap, exploitive or overwrought. Ah, but the years may pass and memories fade, but ""Random Harvest"" has proven to be that rarest of eternal cinematic treasures - genuine  and outstanding in every way.
Warner Home Video delivers a marvelous DVD transfer. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with fine tonality and attention to fine detail. The picture is generally sharp and pleasing on the eyes. Blacks are very rich, deep and solid. Whites are on the whole clean. Occasionally one will detect a note of edge enhancement and the odd age related artifact, but these are bare quibbling on an otherwise flawless presentation. The audio is mono and very nicely balanced. A hint of background hiss is detected in quiescent scenes, but again, for a film element that is pushing 70 plus years, there's really nothing to complain about here.  Two vintage short subjects, a trailer gallery and audio only broadcast of the film round out the extras. A very nicely put together trip down memory lane from the good people over at Warner Brothers.

He was mugged and obviously not on the plane after it took off. Forced off the plane, he was put in significant harm's way as the

threatening opposition was closing in fast. They were firing at the plane carrying Conway and the others as it taxied down the runway.

The old sage's only rule, ""Be kind"" was simple and great. I didn't balk at the fact that the two ""Hollywood nymphets"" (as referred to by another Amazon.com reviewer) were not Asian; because the old sage, himself, was a Belgian missionary and many of Shangri-La's inhabitants were supposed to have been lost foreign travellers who had been rescued. The idea of Shangri-La as a sanctuary for the meek who shall inherit the earth after the strong destroy the strong mysteriously forebode World War II's horrors that happened not too many years after this 1937 film was released.

The story of Shangri-La is a fantasy tale.  Robert Conway (Ronald Colman), his brother George (John Howard), Alexander Lovett (Ed Horton), Henry Barnard (Thomas Mitchell), Gloria Sone (Isabel Jewell) and their Tibetan pilot crash land in Tibet.  The pilot dies.  Then, their adventure begins.

They are taken to a monastery, where despite the winter weather, it is spring inside the valley.  They are told that they were abducted, and that they will not leave.

The story goes on from there, with love interest and Colman's realiztioon that he has met his destiny.

This is a good story, well acted.  Well directed by Capra.  Although released in video in 1994, it is an old black and white.  Franklin Roosevelt, when asked where Doolittle's Tokyo bombers came from, in 1942, said ""Shangri-La.""

Lost Horizon is not the lavish classic it once was. Strangely enough, a movie about people who lived for 200 years was not protected or preserved properly and Robert Gitt's restored version is an extraordinary accomplishment. Robert Gitt worked for over 25 years to find enough footage to restore missing scenes.

The dramatic start and the confusion of the first few scenes draw you into the movie and then a surprisingly leisurely-paced plot keeps your attention to the last second. As a plane takes off by the light of the burning hangers, a few lives have been saved while the fate of those left behind is not really discussed. Once aboard, they realize this plane is flying in the wrong direction. To make matters worse, the plane crashes in the mountains and leaves the passengers stranded in the bitter cold.

Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) is almost unnaturally calm in the face of certain death and throughout the movie he displays the qualities of a hero who is faced with difficult choices. At first he is a captive of Shangri-La's choices and then later he puts his life at risk to follow his destiny. I did love when Conway said: ""Not knowing where you are going is exciting..."" Conway wastes no time anguishing over the unpredictability of life and is a great example of how we can stay calm in the adventure of life itself. I saw this movie as a metaphor for everyone who is seeking an escape from the conflicts of our planetary existence. In a way, the message in Lost Horizon reminded me of the messages in the movie Camelot.

The ideas of how we are killing ourselves with ""indirect suicide"" are still very relevant for today. Walking for 30 minutes and then practicing yoga for 70 minutes is sure to dissolve mountains of stress. If you do that before watching this movie, it can only help to dissolve even more stress. Yoga (a meditation of the body and not a religion) definitely makes you feel and look younger than your age.

The romance in this movie is quite mild and I actually preferred the alternate and more dramatic ending. There are a few flaws in the Shangri-La philosophy of life. How could anyone be happy giving away the woman they loved? While the heart may want peace, the heart may prefer conflict in such cases. It does seem that at times we humans thrive on inner conflicts and external controversy. We are born for the struggle, but Shangri-La definitely sounds like an interesting vacation escape, just don't make me live there without computers. ;) There are ways to find inner peace and I assume that if everyone did yoga, no one would have any time to start wars because they would be floating in some blissful state that is difficult to explain, but very real.

More peaceful escapes: Sarah Swersey's Nightingale CD.

1021038,1,6305416222,"This film should have been left to the ravages of age and studio neglect.  Why anyone would want to restore this abortion of an adaptation is beyond me.  Although the story line is largely intact, many of the characters have been changed.  The Chinese girl ... I don't have the book before me so can't remember the name ... is replaced by a Hollywood nymphet with a supposedly nude bathing scene.  I defy anyone to suspend disbelief when confronted with this sort of baggage in deepest Tibet or wherever.  Another problem is the rather hysterical acting although some of the actors are credible and sympathetic.
This book has not fared well in Hollywood ... this adaptation is the worse of any film I have seen ... the later musical [!!] adaptation is the next worst.",1064275200,9,767,4.651851851851852
1021039,5,6305416222,"One of the earliest movies I remembered enjoying was ""Lost Horizon"".  I remember watching it on a Sunday afternoon on TV and finding myself engrossed in this story of a planeful of assorted refugees who are flown to a remote paradise in the Himalayas.  Dinner was ready before the movie was over but, some years later, I was finally able to see the end.  There is a very real poetic beauty to this film (as there also is to the book which I felt compelled to read).  For years, in my adolesence, I held out hope that explorers would eventually discover a real Shangri-la.  Such is the rapture that can engulf you with this movie.
There is a great deal going for this movie starting with great acting from Ronald Colman through the supporting cast of Sam Jaffe, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, etc.  The directing is great as well.  Could anyone other than Frank Capra have made this movie?  There is action right from the beginning as the characters are hijacked and when the group is led through the mountains to the secret location.  There is comedy, romance, and drama as well.  But most of all there is hope.
This is a movie that came out at a time the world was about to go crazy and we were reminded that if we could get away from all the craziness we could still find peace and sanity.  In time the movie has come to symbolize the Shangri-la that exists for all of us.  As we are caught up in the stresses and strains of modern living, we dream of an escape to serenity.  For many the struggle to find it is difficult, for others it may seem to find them, while others find it but fail to recognize it.  Well, if you're having trouble finding your peace, you might just discover it in this movie.",1061337600,11,1711,4.3734177215189876
1021040,5,6305416222,"""Lost Horizon"" is a Fantasy and a Fable at the same time. Directed by the legendary Frank Capra, this movie belongs in the classic films category, and in its particular genre (fantasy), ""Lost Horizon"" ranks in the top, with movies like ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and ""E.T."".
""Lost Horizon"" tells the story of a group of five people that escape from a Chinese airfield on a plane, eventually they realize that the pilot of the plane is actually kidnapping them. The plane crash-lands in the snowy Tibetan interior, and after a while the group is taken to Shangri-La, a beautiful and mysterious land. Months later, the group feels like they were in home in Shangri-La, and they realize that this is a magic place, where the time seems to stand still, and there is nothing to worry about. So the question is: are they going to stay in Shangri-La, or are they going to return home?
""Lost Horizon"" presents spectacular landscapes, good performances, an excellent story and philosophical subjects. The first half of the movie seems to go nowhere, but after a while all the Frank Capra's magic begin to appear on screen, because the second half of ""Lost Horizon"" is just fantastic, and the essence of the story is revealed in front of our eyes. If you like fantasy films, if you like Frank Capra's work, or if you are looking a special movie, then this movie is for you.
Recommendable.",1058745600,4,1395,4.67479674796748
1021041,5,6305416222,"Few films of the 1930s expressed hope for humanity more beautifully than LOST HORIZON.  And despite the events of the following few decades that would seem to put the lie to its beautiful optimism, it somehow seems to evoke a vision of human longing that is truer than many of the actual events that followed.  This is a movie I truly love, and that despite the fact that one could easily critique it for its political and social simplicity, or any of a myriad of simplifications that make Shangri-la work cinematically although it could never work in actuality.  I don't think anyone would claim that this was a realizable ideal.  So what is its appeal?
First, Capra in this film gave voice to the tendency towards escapism that lives within all of us, though not escapism in a bad sense.  We look around the world, we sense the hard-to-escape stupidity of the whole affair, and we wonder why it isn't possible for all of us to live in harmony, lovingly, kindly.  So, one of the things that Capra does is affirm not an actual political agenda, but those sentiments he sees as constituting humanity at its best.  He makes us yearn for a better world.  Second, Capra, having called us to recognize our own best qualities, asks us to aspire to realize those qualities in our lives, to be less obsessed with grasping after money, to be less vicious towards our fellow humans, to be less in a rush to get to god-knows-what destination, to take more care to know ourselves.  In other words, we need to focus more on what is truly crucial in life, not what we have deemed important.  We are all sleepwalkers, and Capra wants to use a vision of Shangri-la as a means to help us wake up.
The cast does more than its share in selling Capra's vision.  It is inconceivable that anyone could have been a better Robert Conway than Ronald Colman.  That voice!  Colman had been a star of the silent screen, but unlike many silent actors, he was much better suited for sound.  That inimitable voice, that tended to go up on syllables that most English speakers would go down, gave his voice a singsong and poetic quality that was utterly unique.  The supporting cast is solid, with veteran character actors like Edward Everett Horton and Thomas Mitchell adding their usual superb embellishments.  But apart from Colman, the acting kudos unquestionably go to Sam Jaffe, who although only 46-years-old, unforgettably portrays the High Lama, who is hundreds of years old.  The ethereal otherworldliness he imparts to the role is crucial in making Shangri-la feel real instead of merely silly.
There is a great deal of silliness in the film, if one is determined to find it.  All the nonwhites seem delighted to serve the white men.  The design of the buildings looks curiously like the art deco of the 1930s.  Shangri-la itself looks amazingly like certain parts of California.  But this is one of those cases where I take Coleridge's advice to willingly suspend my disbelief, and take a couple of hours to enjoy a more optimistic hope for humanity.",1054425600,8,3030,4.689981096408317

While many of his films involve a certain wide-eyed optimism about the world, in this one he actually built a place to embody those beliefs. Shangri-La is beautifully realized in this movie with its waterfalls, open air schools, animals, abundance of food and shelter and the relative absence of malice and class struggle. Lost Horizon tends to dwell on the idyllic for too long. George's loathing for the place seems completely out of left field. Why isn't he won over like everyone else? I would assume his love interest had persuaded him, but what drives her hatred for the place?

The real beauty of  Lost Horizon comes, however, near the end: torch-bearing natives chanting as they ascend the mountain to the lamasery; Jane Wyatt's passionate flight to stop Ronald Colman abandonning Utopia; and the latter's emotional goodbye to the Valley of the Blue Moon, from the narrow doorway to the Himalayas. The score is perfect, as is most of the acting.
But although the film is a fable about Man's search for Utopia, and a romantic fantasy, it is also an optimistic affirmation of the possibility of return to the past, to lost happiness. Whereas most of the time, in life, good things exist only to pass, eventually, we see Ronald Colman finally managing to find Shangri-La again.

Within the framework of the script, Shangri Lai and its people are quite believable. It is only when one considers the earth-shattering world events that would occur a few years after the movie's release does its vision of peace and harmony seem absurd. Yet, there is at the film's core an almost fanatical belief in the essential goodness of mankind that lights up some hidden dreams of harmony buried deep within many of us.

1021175,1,6305416222,"This is a movie with the reputation of being a ""classic""and I know that many people do not merely like this movie, but love it.
The other reviews make this clear and I respect these views but on a personal note I did not merely dislike the picture but hated it with every fibre of my being.
The reasons are in part aesthetic,as I found it soporific in pace and not terribly well acted or scripted ,.Colman ,an actor I normally admire ,is dull here and Jane Wyatt ill suited to her role The characters are types rather than rounded individuals although the support players struggle gamely with insipid dialogue and sketchy roles.
My fundamental objection is to its political and philosophical leanings. The government of Shangri-La is an autocracy and an oligarchy,ruled by a self-perpetuatind clique who decide what is best for the people. The scenes of the local populace going about their labours are eerily reminiscent of the type of propaganda newsreels churned out at around the same time as the movie by the European dictatorships.
Shagri-La is not an earthly paradise ;it is an autocracy prepared to kidnap those it feels well serve them,and keeping its subjects in thrall to their leaders dictates The movie it most reminds me of is ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" but here the only ones who have the insight and intestinal fortitude to oppose the regime(Maria and George)are treated with little or no symathy by the script
If you love the film you will keep on doing so despite what anyone else thinks and rightly so,but I really found this autocratic wolf in moralistic clothing deeply offensive.",1008892800,30,1607,4.826086956521739
1021176,5,6305416222,"This is a superb, academy award winning film, directed by the late, great Frank Capra. Based upon James Hilton's book of the same name, it is as fresh today as it was nearly sixty five years ago, when it was first released in 1937.

The film opens up in Baskul, China, somewhere near the Tibetan border in 1935, where a minor revolution appears to be occuring, and foreigners are being evacuated. A world weary and dashing diplomat, Robert Conway, magnificently played by the ever handsome, melliflously voiced Ronald Colman, is directing the evacuation efforts. He, his brother George, and three others, two men and one woman, manage to board the last plane out of this rife torn area of China. Unbeknownst to them, their pilot has been overcome by another person, who comandeers the plane.

They finally realize something in wrong when they notice that the plane is traveling west instead of east. Moreover, they are unable to do anything about it, as no one on board, other than the pilot, can fly a plane. They seem to be flying in the Himalyan region, as they are surrounded by snow capped peaks, flying at an altitude of about 21,000 feet. Suddenly, their plane lands in the mountains, the pilot dead at the controls. Strangely enough, they are met by a crowd of people, as if they were expected. At their head is a Mr. Chang, a very dignified gentleman, masterfully played by W.B. Warner, who provides them with appropriate clothing for a high altitude climb through a very daunting and precarious mountain pass. Fortuitously for all, Mr. Chang speaks English beautifully.

After a seeming death defying trek through the mountains, in  what appear to be blizzard conditions, they arrive at a beautiful and peaceful valley protected from inclement weather.  They have now reached the mythical and utopian kingdom of Shangri-La. It is here that Robert Conway meets Saundra, the woman of his dreams, played by a very young and beautiful Jane Wyatt. It is love at first sight.

He also discovers that his plane was comandeered with the express purpose of bringing him to Shangri-La, as it is the wish of their dying leader, Padre Perro, a Belgian priest, played with saintly spirituality by Sam Jaffee, that Conway should be the new leader of this utopian paradise, where people seem to live long, very long, lives. Touched by the saintliness of Padre Perro and in love with the beauty and peace he sees and feels all around him, Conway is very much interested in remaining. It is as if he had finally found that for which he had been searching all his life.

His brother, George, however, has no wish to stay, the only one of those who were on board the plane who feels that way. An attractive young woman whom he met in this idyllic spot, and  who has fallen for George, professes to want to leave, as well. Together the two of them persuade Robert to leave. Giving in to them out of a sense of obligation, he leaves with them, but what happens on the way back to the world that they knew, convinces Robert that he must return to Shangri-la and the woman he loves, at any cost. What happens next will not disappoint.

This film is a masterpiece that keeps the viewer enthralled. While some of the events that occur during the film are higly improbable, that does not dampen the enthusiasm that one is sure to develop for this well made movie. It is, without a doubt, a cinematic classic.",1000684800,4,3392,4.668341708542713
1021177,5,6305416222,"With those calmly spoken words, we and Ronald Colman are ushered into the remarkable fantasy world where no one grows old in real time and everyone seems supremely happy--except for the brooding Maria, that is. A menacing Mongolian hijacks Colman's plane and its passengers on a mysterious flight to a snowy mountain region beyond Tibet. What for? That's what the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffee has to impart to Colman. The other passengers are chomping at the bit to leave Shangri-La, but slowly get drawn into the life they have found there. Colman's feeling no pain either, as he begins a romance with Jane Wyatt, a pixie-ish lass he pursues to a romantic waterfall. But ultimately, he faces a difficult challenge: should he remain in this land, selfishly enjoying himself, or should he brave the blizzard conditions with his malcontent brother and Maria, his brother's girlfriend, to return to the frantic life he left behind? The film has wonderful atmosphere and even the archival footage worked into the video as still shots with the original soundtrack over them works well--it just makes you realize how great the actors' speaking voices were in the age of radio. My personal favorite scene is a prolonged conversation between Colman and the exceptional HB Warner as Chang, when Chang explains to Colman how Shangri-La was founded, while he and Colman are evidently cracking walnuts. The rapport between these two pros is excellent; you really don't want the scene to end, it's so well executed.

Finally after a long and arduous airplane journey, you land in the adult version of Oz. A place where the Greek ideals of beauty, wisdom and goodness have long ago rooted and flourished into a way of life. Every character is perfectly cast. Ronald Coleman and Jane Wyatt (I didn't know what a beautiful and talented actress she was) are the ideal couple. Sam Jaffe makes a non-believer believe. The subtle humor and collective entanglements offer a glimpse into our silver reflections within. And most surprisingly, the still photos not only do not detract from the flow and quality of the film, they enhance the dialogue (you could almost believe this was intentional on the director's part, instead of a way to compensate for lost film footage).

Colman needs to decide if he can leave behind his old life and settle into his new life.  The performances are alright, although characterization isn't the focus of this film.  Dialogue isn't a real priority either, as lofty ideals and the meaning of life are discussed repeatedly.  The strength of this film is the atmosphere it creates, as the viewer actually comes to wish that a place such as Shangri-La really could exist.  The photography is excellent and director Frank Capra captures a feeling and mood that is quite remarkable.

The story is deep with an ending that has almost moved me to tears every time I see the film.  It is more than a fantastic adventure, a romance, or a mere story of enchantment.

Ronald Coleman,s voice  is still one the most unique ever. Timeless.",960163200,,474,4.607142857142857
1021215,5,6305416222,"LOST HORIZON was Capra's most ambitious film of the thirties - a masterpiece of technique.  Based by upon the novel by James Hilton and exquisitely photographed by Joseph Walker, it opens in Baskul, China on March 1, 1935.  The opening sequences are extraordinary: the evocation of a swarming mob, flare path lights illuminating contorted faces, hysterical Europeans gathered in an airport building, plane after plane roaring out into the night...... Escaping form a revolution, four people are kidnapped by a plane and taken to an idyllic civilization in a Tibetian valley, a Utopia by the name of Shangri-La where people are peacefully kind and time seems to stand still. This Columbia production cost $2,500,000 which was a gargantuan amount for the most successful of the so-called ""poverty row studios"". A very unusual film for director Capra, it became one of his top masterpieces. H. B. Warner is memorable as the spiritual and refined Chang as are Sam Jaffe as the High Lama, and Isabel Jewell as the little tubercular tramp. Colman is in his element as Robert Conway (and speaks in his charmingly cadenced mannner). The then unknown Jane Wyatt is cleverly cast as Sondra. Only John Howard as Conway's brother seems unable to handle an awkwardly written role.  Fundamentally absurd though its entire concept is, the film still has the power to move an audience.  Graham Greene once pointed out that Capra's vison of Shangri-La - the genteel Himalayan utopia of peace, health and eternal - resembled a film star's luxurious estate in Beverly Hills!  Audiences relished this film in 1937 and the famous aging scene with Margo still haunts viewers today!",958694400,6,1659,5.062271062271062

1021217,5,6305416222,"I saw this picture in South Wales England at the age of 8. I was overwelmed and captivated by it. I saw this Picture again when I came to America in 1947.

1021218,5,6305416222,"Yes, this movie is one of the oldest sound films we have available today, but the magic of its presentation hasn't diminished at all.  By being shot in black and white with its crude sound, this film seems to enhance the awe  and enchantment of the mystical land of Shangri-La which James Hilton so  vividly described in his classic novel.  The book and film were made even  more popular when Franklin D. Roosevelt named the Maryland presidential  retreat ""Shangri-La"" (Eisenhower renamed it ""Camp  David"").  A modern color remake of this film in musical form made back  in the seventies was far less commercially successful than this thirties  version.  It's a great showcase for the now-deceased veteran actors Ronald  Colman, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, Sam Jaffe, et al.",946771200,4,786,5.0546875
1021219,4,6305416222,"LOST HORIZON is a very special and very philosophical movie based on the James Hilton novel. The movie makes a few changes from the book, but in many ways the film actually improves on the novel, not the least of which  is having the great Ronald Colman flesh out the part of Robert Conway. It's  not Colman's most memorable performance (see TALE OF TWO CITIES for that)  but he wears the part like a comfortable suit. Supporting him are some  other great players like Edward Everett Horton, Thomas Mitchell, Sam Jaffe  and Isabel Jewell to name a few. What would YOUR reaction be when you  discover that the commandeered airplane that took you to a mysterious,  beautiful land in the middle of the wintry Himalayas was not an accident,  but a plan? The lost world of Shangri-La is something different to  everyone, and it's not always a land of bliss and happiness as you'll see.  The film itself has gone through many difficult years, and the painstaking  reconstruction (sometimes down to still frames with audio) receives a fine  presentation on DVD. It's the restoration and the extras that make the disc  worth viewing. A brief section shows how some frames were restored, and we  get to see some rare pristine footage of the funeral procession. A good  feature commentary and documentary are also included. Overall, then, it's a  fine film and a fine DVD supplying fine extras. What's not fine? Well, it's  only fair to comment on the extremely variable quality of the image (as I  said, it's a combination of several decent prints, some 16mm prints and the  occasional still-frame section). That's not the fault of Columbia, as it is  most likely the best they could do. But upon comparison to my VHS tape of  the restored film, I was surprised to see that the quality is only  *slightly* better, not dramatically better. That's why I say in all  fairness that it's really the extras that make it worthwhile, but that's  coming from someone who already had a video copy of the restored film in  his collection. If you've never seen the film, I recommend it unreservedly.",945734400,201,2078,4.737430167597766
1021220,5,6305416222,"I have loved this film and the James Hilton novel upon which it is based since I was a child. ""Lost Horizon"" is one of the truly great moviegoing experiences.  I think we all want to believe in Shangri-La, a  paradise which brings out the best in mortals, offering a chance of  redemption.
The film has a great cast: Ronald Colman (what a voice!),  lovely Jane Wyatt, Thomas Mitchell, H.B. Warner, Edward Everett Horton, Sam  Jaffe and the almost forgotten (but very good) Isabel Jewell - she also  appeared with Colman in ""A Tale of Two Cities.""
The set design  has to be seen to be truly appreciated.  Shangri-La is a prime example of  Art Deco at it's most beautiful.
The film, as it exists today, is a bit  like Frankenstein's monster, stitched together from a wide variety of  sources, some of them in better condition than others.  The story of the  quarter-century restoration of the film is a fascinating example of the  dedication to see a project through to it's completion.
The only  complaint I have about the film, and it's a minor one, is about the number  of expository sequences in the film.  It seems that one character or  another is always talking about what has gone on or what is going on.  H.B.  Warner's character, in particular, seems to exist for the most part to  explain the backstory of Shangri-La.  But that's, as I said, a minor  complaint.  This is a superb motion picture.",944697600,131,1404,4.5910931174089065
1021221,5,6305416222,"This film is not for the shallow-minded. There are no sex-scenes or senseless explosions. Rather, an artistic depiction of Earth's two classes  of humans. Those who want to live in peace and enjoy an eternity in  happiness, and those who prefer mindless, short-lived pleasures which incur  death.
The acting by all is remarkable. In particular, Thomas Mitchell  who's made noteworthy performances in 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'The  Fighting Sullivans.'
An intelligent, heart-warming film for the entire  family.",940896000,8,513,5.512820512820513
1021222,5,6305416222,"Frank Capra's LOST HORIZON is finally given its due on DVD. This is the most complete version of this great film available. The source material varies from excellent to barely watchable, but at least it is complete.  Some sections are represented with still frames as the footage still  remains missing. This is quite frustrating as the movie was photographed so  beautifully, but Columbia Pictures did very little to keep the negatives  complete and in good condition. So we should be thankful LOST HORIZON looks  as good as it does. The cast, with the exception of John Howard (David  Niven should have played Howard's part) is flawless. Ronald Colman was one  of Hollywood's greatest actors. One never tires from watching and  ""listening"" to his performance. This great DVD includes an  insightful commentary shared by Charles Champlin and Kendall Miller who  discuss the making of the movie along with its arduous restoration. A good  30 minute documentary covers the making of the movie (some aspects are  duplicated from the commentary track). Also included are some deleted  sequences, a still file with Kendall's narration and a teaser trailer. It  would have been wonderful if Dimitri Tiomken's great score could have been  isolated, but this may not have been possible given the quality of the  source material. Get LOST HORIZON on DVD, you won't be disappointed. It is  definetly a classic worth keeping.",940723200,104,1415,5.109170305676856
