Outside Romdo, a small colony of scavengers live.  A disease kills most people who leave the city, but some manage to survive.  Vince and Pino live with the colony for a short time.  Re-l tries to get Vince to return to Romdo, but she falls prey to the disease. Re-l is returned to the city.  We find out where babies come from.  Daedelus tells Re-l a little bit about the ugly proxy, but he doesn't know much, apparently. Vince and Pino leave on the Rabbit, a wind-powered flying ship, heading to Mosk.  On their journey, they end up in the middle of a battle between men and autoreivs.  A third proxy, female and flying, appears.  The joker-faced proxy appears.  There's a fight.  Guess who wins?

War, what is it good for?  Pino says, ""I don't get it.""  Do you?",1331856000,,787,4.450704225352113

8155412,5,B000KB48MA,"If I could have given this more than 5 stars I would have. Ergo-Proxy is the best Anime I have ever seen to-date. And I've seen TONS! This series is beautiful, thought provoking,and it makes you think about our society. I almost wish they would play this in theatre just so more people could have access to it. It makes you question god,government,and what purpose we have for playing the role we play. This isn't an anime you can just sit and watch...its something you sit and try to obsorb into yourself. The art is beyond anything else Ive seen in Anime yet! Its not only thought provoking but its beautiful. Once you've seen it you'll see anime in a whole new light. I HIGHLY recommend this whole series. I own them all!",1193702400,2,724,4.451127819548872
8155413,5,B000KB48MA,"Vincent Law and Pino are still living in the Commune, the ragtag settlement of Romdo outcasts and pariahs outside the dome. A lot of the residents are beginning to wonder if maybe they'd be better off if Vincent was not among them because his presence is inciting more frequent and deadly Romdo patrols. But the leader of the Commune has his own designs for Vincent, raving him up as a revolutionary that could grant them all Romdo citizenship and let them return to their former lives. He even promises that an envoy from the city will soon arrive. Indeed, someone does soon arrive, but it's not a diplomat. It's Re-l, and she's come to take Vincent back, with his consent or without, hoping that he offers a clue to the mystery of the Proxy. Meanwhile, Raul Creed wants revenge on Vincent for making him look bad before the Romdo rulers and plans to kill him as soon as he shows his face.

Even with the bleakness of the Blade Runneresque setting the writer of Ergo Proxy succeeds quite admirably in crafting a very human story about characters who are very far from being human. While I suspect that Vincent is a Proxy and I know Pino is an android, their relationship is becoming one of father and daughter very quickly, as Pino continues to advance in terms of dealing with and analyzing/assimilating human feelings. It's quite a nice bond. Re-l herself is thawing out a bit with her obsessive hunt for Vincent which seems on the surface for information, but beneath it, you sense some sort of romantic investment. There is layer upon layer of motivation for the characters of this series and the fact that you don't quite know the allegiance of each adds to the suspense and intrigue of the show. The plot has come a bit more into focus with a lot more information to be digested in these episodes as to the origin of the Proxies and how Romdo functions. This is a great show so far and looks only to get better.",1172361600,,1918,4.527377521613833
8155414,4,B000KB48MA,"The second volume of Ergo Proxy continues to devulge bits and pieces of information that left you scratching your head after the first disc. Now that Vincent is in the outer world after escaping the domed city of Romdo, he is constantly being searched for by patrol vehicles from the city. As a result of the increased patrols the people living in the commune come to distrust Vincent and factions begin to form. All the while Re-L continues her search for the truth behind the existence of Proxys. Knowing that Vincent is the key to unlocking the mystery, she leaves the city withouit permission to track him down and bring him back. But the outside world is full of disease that is capable of killing a person within a few days if no vaccine is given. This is the basic setup entering the first episode of this disc and everything continues to change and evolve from there. What are the proxys? What does Vincent have to do with their appearance? Some answers will be given and some more questions will be raised.

The only downside to the series thus far is the lack of character progression. Although after viewing the second disc there are signs that information is just waiting to be devulged. It provides us with Vince's growing instability and soul searching, Re-L's relation with her grandfather who runs the city Romdo, the objectives and motives of technical officer, and Re-L's friend, Daedalus, and the desires of the ruling council of Romdo. All are set up for major revelations but nothing has been given yet. As a result, just as things start to come together, we are left hanging until the next volume is released. While not everything is laid out for you, Ergo Proxy continues to devulge its secrets at a pace that keeps you crawling back for the rest.",1171238400,3,1770,4.673076923076923
8155415,4,B000KB48MA,"The second volume of Ergo Proxy shifts the main focus of the show from the conflicted Inspector Re-l onto the now-exiled immigrant, Vincent Law.  So too, is the focus shifted from the domed city of Romdo and out into the surrounding wasteland.

Many of the characters we've met develop new dimensions.  Re-l goes to new lengths to learn the truth behind the happenings in Romdo, while Vincent becomes more hopeless and withdrawn.

Pino, the infected little girl AutoReiv continues to accompany Vincent, and she adds a welcome element of wonder and innocence to the dreary setting, while her character continues to develop, becoming more human.

I can't say these episodes are perfect; the series continues to be very plot-driven, so the characters are not developed as much as they could be.

That being said, there are still quite a few episodes left to get to know the characters, and the plot has developed to the point where the episodes have that ""potato chip"" feel: once you begin, it's very difficult to stop watching.

With the continually high production quality of the show, and some very surprising plot developments, especially in the last two episodes, the wait until the next four will be all the more difficult.",1170115200,6,1226,4.922330097087379
