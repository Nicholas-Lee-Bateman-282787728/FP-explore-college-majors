It's an extraordinary, lovely film. You can't be Polish and Catholic without being filled with pride.",1480464000,,264,4.638297872340425

8278462,3,B001AOW7LU,"My family immigrated in the early 1900s finally settling in Hamtramck about 1920. This video seemed to focus more on today and made occasional references to the past. I wanted to see interviews with the older generation, stories about the culture and various landmarks from the time when my people lived there.

This video was good for what it was but left me feeling incomplete. I bought this with the intention of giving it to my mother who was born in Detroit and hasn't visited Hamtramck in 40 years. I just didn't think she would get any appreciation from this video so I'll file it away in my personal collection.",1341878400,5,619,4.627272727272727
