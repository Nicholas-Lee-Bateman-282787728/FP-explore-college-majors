1018773,1,6305363528,"Waylon Jennings, looking like Joe Spinell, is killed off in the first scene of this half baked western. He is the lucky one. His son, Chad Willett, decides to take revenge on Jennings' killer, a former member of Jennings' outlaw gang. Willett is joined by two other former outlaw gang members Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson, making like Abbott and Costello, and they ride after the bland villain, taking poor Travis Tritt (a third gang member).
Nelson and Kristofferson do the same old TV western movie routine they have been doing for years- flat delivery, down home humorous bickering, and goofy grins. Tritt tries what he can, relying on all the acting chops he earned in his music videos. He has onscreen charisma, it would be interesting to see what a professional director might mold with him. Willett, probably the only real actor here, is okay. After getting killed, Jennings does what he does best- voiceover, as his son reads his diary.
The Unmagnificent Four get involved in little unthreatening scrapes here and there on their way to meet the villain. They are held up, but get their stuff back with the help of some friendly Native Americans they helped save. Willett finds romance, because if you are young and cute in a western, you must fall in love. Of course, that philosophy does not explain how Nelson manages to do the same thing. He falls for a local senorita in a town where the villain burned down the church. These happy outlaws help rebuild the church in one of those saccharine scenes that must be seen to be believed. The actual climactic shootout is dull, thanks to some really bland direction. At one point, Willett has a perfect opportunity to finish the villain off, thereby sparing Mexico and the audience from further torture, but he does not! The added ""mystery"" about the true identity of Willett's real father is never resolved, either!
This is just dumb entertainment for people who find ""F Troop"" too deep. I am warning you now, Nelson has a bathtub scene. No nudity, but proceed with caution. ""Outlaw Justice"" is an injustice.
This (R) rated ""unedited director's cut"" looks no different that a regular TV movie. It contains physical violence, gun violence, and mild gore.",1022371200,6,2217,4.836842105263158

1018906,3,6305363528,"Released to TV in 1999, ""Outlaw Justice"" (aka ""The Long Kill"") is a low-budget Western featuring Kris Kristofferson and Country & Western stars Willie Nelson, Travis Tritt and Waylon Jennings, the latter in a cameo at the beginning who narrates through the rest. These guys play noble outlaw-types who team-up with the son of Jennings' character (Chad Willett) to apprehend -- or, more likely, kill -- the murderer of a former gang member (Sancho Gracia).

The plot is reminiscent of ""The Wild Bunch,"" but with likable protagonists rather than the contemptible dirtbags of that classic Western. Unfortunately, ""Outlaw Justice"" doesn't have the budget of that major release and this is readily apparent in the opening scene. The style of the movie also takes the mythical approach of Spaghetti Westerns and throws in some humor. As such, the tone is part-serious and part-joke, which was hard for me to embrace. In fact, the first couple of times I tried to watch ""Outlaw Justice"" I quit before reaching the 30 minute mark. However, once you catch a grip it's entertaining enough; the Western sets are good (although the effects are weak) and the stars are charismatic. Nelson may not be the best actor, but he's amiable. Kristofferson stands out with that ""cool"" Eastwood vibe and the fact that he's intimidating without even saying a word. Unfortunately, with the exception of a cameo by Leonor Watling, this is strictly an all-dude flick.

If you're a fan of the stars and their music this is a must. If not, it's a mediocre, but likable, modern TV Western.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Almeria, Andalucia, Spain.

1018911,5,6305363528,"This film deserves recognition. My youth's association with country music gave way to what has been referred to as ""Classic Rock"" for too many years. Funny thing about age, it has a sneaky way of taking you back to your roots. I have grown a real appreciation for Waylon Jennings voice, it has this strong range of depth with a character of wildness, (I was so ugly the doctor slapped my mama when I was born, then he took out his pocket knife and cut off my horns), then turn tender (Where would I be without you), but always a commanding presence. The same is evident in this film, even though his appearance is a cameo, the story is his and his voice is perfect for narration. There is a richness against prior films in Willie and Kris' characters, again aging has it's advantages. Not to leave out Travis Tritt's, this is a film worth the watch.",1401494400,,849,4.414012738853503

Sancho Gracia as Holden (the bad guy)
A bunch of former outlaws (Willie, Kris, Tritt) are bent on revenge when one of their former ""business associates"" (Jennings)
is murdered by another outlaw, Holden (Sancho Gracia).  They extract their own version of justice when Holden lures them below the border, with hopes of causing their deaths.

I don't know why the ""R"" rating.  The violence was almost non-existent, no bad language, and no nudity or anything you would be ashamed for your mother or children to see.

Only Tritt and Willie sang in the film, and the motivation of Holden was ill-defined.  Altogether a poorly motivated plot, with the cast providing the backbone of the film.  They did their parts well, making it an adequate Western to watch and kill some time, thanks to them.  Not a great film, or particularlt memorable.

I am always impressed by Kris and Willie when they team up.  Kris is good at ""looking menacing,"" and Willie is entertaining.
