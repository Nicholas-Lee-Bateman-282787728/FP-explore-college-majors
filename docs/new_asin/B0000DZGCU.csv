8562175,1,B0000DZGCU,The video is a good source of information for beginners or those wishing to make only basic book repairs. However if you're looking to learn how to make a proper or professional repair this is not the video for you. The techniques shown are acceptable for library and other books and documents that may be important but hold little monetary value. As a collector of antique and 1st edition books I would not recommend these techniques. The video also does not adress cleaning or proper maintenance and care of books. To be honest you can get these same video instructions on utube. I recommend you save your money!,1291507200,3,614,4.694444444444445
