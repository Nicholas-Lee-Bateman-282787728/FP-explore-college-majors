8344125,5,B001UKZJK0,"I too used this DVD set to help me decide about doing an Arctic river trip.  As anyone knows who's looked into such adventures, they're not cheap so the more info you have for decision-making, the better.  By providing a first-hand and detailed visual account of exactly what such a trip is like, this set was invaluable.

But even if you are strictly an arm-chair traveler, if you enjoy getting to know someplace fascinating and very different from what most of us have seen ""outside"" the Alaskan frontier, this DVD set will give you hours of pleasure. Watching the river scene glide by, thrilling to classic Alaskan mega-fauna up close, experiencing the subtle but constant lighting changes from the ""Midnight Sun"" is time richly spent.  Just when the typical ""nature"" documentary  would end, you'll still have several hours of great video and still pics to savor!  Definitely worth the money no matter your goals!  THANKS Dave!",1236297600,,930,4.923076923076923
8344126,5,B001UKZJK0,"I got these videos recently to help me plan a float trip on the Kongakut. All I can say is ""WOW"". The quality of these videos far surpassed my expectations. I was just looking for some insights into the canyon section of the river that has some class III rapids (in June). What I found was a lesson on wildlife, hiking, rafting, and river travel. Tons of insights were offered within the video and commentary provided. Tastefully offered and there was no babbling to fill camera time. Wonderful images of the land, auffice, caribou, birds, etc.. and I feel like I have already been to the area. I am certainly less fearful of tackling this river myself after watching the videos. Certainly a river that is as remote as this one demands respect, but to have seen it so intimately prior to taking the trip is a huge benefit. My hats off to the fellows that put this video set together. Job well done!",1236211200,,898,4.4817073170731705
8344127,5,B001UKZJK0,"I got this to help me plan a trip to the area. Such a far away land with so little info available. Well, not pictures or video anyway. I got the video set and have now planned my trip. Great insights into the land, wildlife, and the river itself. My group has all watched the videos and we are more excited than ever. Fear of the unknown almost prevented us from taking this trip. Thankfully I got these videos and saw the natural wonders we would have missed if we did not take this trip. Worth much more than I paid for it. A must have for anyone traveling to ANWR or floating Alaska rivers in the arctic.",1236211200,,607,4.1525423728813555
