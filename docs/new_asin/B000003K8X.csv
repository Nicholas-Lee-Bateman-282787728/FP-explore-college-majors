7902643,4,B000003K8X,"Quark and Odo have always had a love/hate relationship and this is particularly apparent in ""The Ascent.""  The two are stranded on a harsh planet when their runabout crashes.  With no provisions and their usual communications link not working, they must haul a heavy transmitter to the peak of a very high mountain so they can send a distress call to DS9.  Making the trip especially rough is the fact that all the food and water on the planet is poisonous and the temperatures are below freezing.  They not only battle the elements in their quest to survive, but they battle each other as well.  On DS9 Quark and Odo never had to depend on one another so it is particularly difficult for them when they discover they must lean on each other to survive.
Quark's and Odo's journey is highlighted by funny one-liners, mutual insults, constant battles with the harsh elements, and a dawning truth about their relationship that shocks both of them.",1009670400,,944,4.7317073170731705
7902644,3,B000003K8X,"When Quark is indicted to testify against members of the O'Ryan syndicate, Odo arrests him and they begin their journey to trial in a runabout.  However, in route, they discover that the runabout has been sabatoged and end up crashing on a remote planet.  The runabout is unsalvagable, and so the only way the constantly at-odds pair will be rescued is to carry a transmitter to the top of a mountain...together.
Although the banter between Quark and Odo is always entertaining, I found this episode to be a little slow in the middle. If you are a huge fan of the Quark/Odo matchup, I'd say purchase it.  Otherwise, there are better episodes of DS9 to spend your money on!",1008201600,,672,4.630252100840337
7902645,3,B000003K8X,"Odo is escorting Quark to a Federation trial when they find a bomb on their Runabout, the resulting explosion forces the ship to crash on to a  planet with sub-zero temperatures. Odo and Quark must work together to take  the sub-space transmitter high enough up a mountain for it to send out an  emergency message.
This is an average episode with some excellent  dialogue between Quark and Odo, the sub-plot about Jake and Nog is less  entertaining and bogs down this otherwise great episode.",966729600,,492,4.809523809523809
