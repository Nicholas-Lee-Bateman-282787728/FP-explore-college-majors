A very useful DVD to know about the Earth needs and the danger we are doing to it.",1380844800,2,120,4.260869565217392
4398064,5,B004KRQFNK,"For those of you who were upset about the footage not being entirely from above as the title states, you have my sympathies.  Maybe the ""mistitle"" is what it took to get some of you to watch this type of ""political"" nature show.  I myself rented it first from my local library and then went out and purchased it from Amazon.  I had a copy of Bertrand's book on photography of Earth from above that I purchased ten years back and was excited to see footage from above (I myself have photographed several times from a low flying plane in Utah).  I was disappointed at first, but as I watched further into the dvd I was both amazed and blown away from some of the stats about our habitat and wildlife accross the globe.  I hike and photograph pretty regularly in the northeast U.S. but really haven't paid attention to the situation around the world in recent years.  Back in the 80's and 90's my friends and I would always talk about the fate and future of the planet's wildlife being bleak. I just never realized how fast these days would come.  I hear things in the news periodically about the bats, the bees the tree frogs, polar bears, etc., but like most of us I'm too busy running my fast paced American lifestyle.  This dvd set will really make you stop and think!!  Sorry again about the ""mistitle"".
It should be mandatory viewing for all of us.

The cover gives every indication that the main subject is beautiful aerial landscapes, when 80% or more is a completely unilateral, politically-biased talk-a-thon (talk-a-ton too) entirely FILMED FROM THE GROUND.

4398069,1,B004KRQFNK,I totally agree with the review before mine.  I purchased this box set for the spectacular aerial views of the earth as it promised.

8433340,2,B004KRQFNK,"Amazon-Earth From Above DVD series; Montparnasse Productions.  2006, 400 total minutes (6 hours, 40 minutes).

While many viewers will anticipate a satellite view of the earth, this series by French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand mixes extended on-ground interviews with photography from a helicopter which in only a few cases has the ""wow"" effect of satellite photos. Unfortunately, the series is laden with so much non-science environmentalism that the good photography, data and some interviews are vastly overshadowed by the downright wrong ""science"" and sometimes contradictory advocacy. This was originally narrated in French with various characters speaking in other languages from Spanish to English, and the Questar version has English subtitles. Two voices are used, and when it switches to the female narrator is when the script becomes an extremist screed. For discs 1 and 3-6, a few scenes could be used by teachers with the teacher turning off the sound and narrating him/herself. Most of disc 2 is centrist to science that the program could be used with sound on but only if the teacher stresses that water is a cycle and therefore renewable, which is mentioned but gets lost in the narrative.  Each disc ends with a brief thank you to each of the persons interviewed, and noting that the carbon consumed in filming this series was compensated by buying carbon offsets.  The removal of the uniform introductions and endings would reduce the series length to 6 hours.

Disc 1: Biodiversity (94 minutes) Begins by asserting that 30% of species have been lost in the last 30 years, and rapidly surveys the many ""hotspots"" of diversity including some views from a hot air balloon. Segments include a lion pride up close and a cheetah that poses (and defecates) on top of a Land Rover. Visits a Masai protected reserve and notes the difficulty of patrolling to save wildlife in close contact with people. One million gnus migrate and some die crossing a river. The Congo hippopotamus has been reduced from 30,000 to 800, along with loss of fish that fed on hippo feces; the problem is human encroachment. Work of World Wildlife Fund is noted. Problems with elephant poaching described. Mount Kilimanjaro glacial melt results in a swamp, but glaciation is threatened by global warming. The elephant ecosystem is in conflict with the Masai who have moved to farming; when batteries are stolen, the solar-power electric fence is off. Orphaned baby elephants cared for. The scene switches to the Pantanal of South America; e 50% of wetlands have been lost. An anaconda is shown eating a capybara. Jaguar hunting versus jaguar conservation. Rehabilitation of a giant otter orphan. Scene switches back to Africa where Kenya tea plantations are huge! In saving the Kakamiga Forest, this is an example of how 3 billion people in the world depend on wood for heating and cooking.  Again, the distinction between renewable and non-renewable resources is not made, and the discussion is left at a simplistic level. Scene changes to Tasmanian forests where virgin forests are ""clearcut"" by helicopters dropping napalm to replace eucalyptus with industrial forests to make paper for Japan (again, no deeper discussion of scale). 10-80 is used to poison animals. Violence occurs in political battle to save forests. Back to Africa and flamingoes cover a salty lake in the Rift Valley. A father takes his son into forests to learn the herbal uses of some plants. The Artemesia plant in China has recently been found to be an effective medicine for replacing chloroquine in fighting malaria. A Chinese apothecary is shown with many roots, leaves, etc. A major indication of the non-science in this series is the repeated reference to malaria as being caused by bacteria, a very serious error because bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics but the Plasmodium that causes malaria is a protist that is therefore not affected. In addition, this one case of Artemesia is used incorrectly to glorify Chinese medicine as a superior pharmacology system when instead, this is one exception. Herbalist concoctions are loaded with impurities and only under Western medical procedures where the active ingredient is isolated--as was the case with Artemesia--is this traditional folk medicine of any value. Back to Africa and Lake Victoria, where the exotic Nile perch was introduced in 1954 and has completely altered the fish community as well as promoted overfishing. In contrast to purist environmentalism, this series does weigh in the human factors and needs in some of its discussion, but not all. Finally, this disc provides a global warming overview, the melting of all of the Kilimanjaro glacier and resulting change in plants.  In contrast to earlier geological climate changes, today's changes are too fast for organisms to adapt. If all developing peoples came to live as the French currently do, we would need 3 planets--this is the signature line of this series. Polar bear biology is described (only partly correctly) and effect of warming on the Inuit. Even in polar regions, pollution biomagnifies into shrimp and eventually the bears and human breast milk. Final scenes return to the origin of humans in Africa.

Disc 2: Water (96 minutes) which is to say freshwater. Only 0.03% of water is available to humans (rest is polar ice and groundwater). Petra in Jordan was deserted 2000 years ago but survived back then by water conservation. Today, there is an unequal distribution of water where the rich have plenty and the poor do not--this is the central theme of this program which is mostly acceptable science. Las Vegas in the Mojave Desert uses more than twice the per capita water as the rest of the U.S. Three-fourths of this goes to water golf courses and lawns, etc. Lake Meade serves seven states and is now inadequate for Las Vegas. Additional water is planned to come from the mountain aquifers that also serve ranchers. Scene switches to Amman Jordan which has 1/15th the per capita use of water; the city of 2 million have water only once a week and it is ten times more costly.  Now, worldwide the water cycle is described. Oceans contain 97% of water which evaporates to clouds that condense as rain or snow that runs off in streams that are unequally distributed. In the monsoon areas, 3/4th of the rain comes in 1/4th of the year.

The one problematic statement made is that ""Water is not inexhaustible""--the problem is too complex to be generalized this way. The video moves to the Dead Sea where it is ten times saltier than the ocean and dropping in level by one meter per year. The Rive Jordan is inadequate to refill it. The Dead Sea is a site for salt mining for chemicals.  Brief view of the Aral Sea that is about gone. In contrast, the Loire River in France was preserved by civilian efforts that halted dams and shoreline modifications. Energy from a dam is replaced by wind generators.  Back to the Jordan Desert as a representative of the 41% of the earth that is desert or semi-desert and holds 2 billion of the earth's people. An oasis in the Arabian Desert depends on rocks and sand to purify water. Desert plants trap dew as water.  A few seconds of footage show tenebrionid beetles soaking dew water! Light color reflects heat. Lizard alternates lifting legs on hot sand. Sand viper buries itself. David Ben Gurion's forest in the Negev Desert in Israel. Use of trees to counter desertification.  Onions are grown in the Mali Sahel by rationing water carefully. 70% of freshwater is used by irrigation. The cost of products is more and more determined by water usage. Aquifers are being drained for center-pivot irrigation in Jordan. Poor water quality (ocean desalination is expensive and leaves much salt) causes kidney stones in Gaza. Even the rich waterfalls in the Minas Gerias of Brazil do not prevent water shortages, and Danielle Mitterand advocates for a Biosphere Reserve. A large iron mine is shown, along with the concomitant need to burn eucalyptus to produce charcoal to produce steel, and resultant soil erosion from iron, gold and diamond mining Finally a view of the Judean Desert and Masada; then to Jerusalem where three religions work together. Will water be an issue for peace, or war?

Disc 3: Seas and Oceans I (52 minutes) 70% of our oxygen comes from algae in the sea, and oceans comprise 70% of the earth's surface. Footage begins are the Corsica coastline, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Concern is over wastes dumped into oceans along coasts, the same place fish breed. The Mediterranean is a problem since it is mostly enclosed and not flushed by world ocean currents. However, the program turns dark when they give legitimacy to the c0-founder of Greenpeace and Sea Shepard captain Paul Watson, an admitted outlaw and pirate. He questions policing and claims to be police-like. Footage shows his ship ramming and sinking whaling ships, spray painting seals, etc. He is hired to patrol the seas around the Galapagos. The coverage of the Galapagos does not include the fact that the area has strict limitations on numbers of visitors and forces guests to be housed in ships offshore--again a one-sided perspective to hype the negatives. Footage shows wasteful harvesting of shark fins.  Off Italy and France is a marine park showing large groupers restoring a predator-balanced ecosystem. Brief summary of tragic oil spills show damaged birds, etc. but no perspective of proportions of shorelines affected. Also leaves the impression of oil damage is forever.. This video continually repeats the ""fragility of the balance of nature"" despite the growing evidence of the durability and recovery ability of nature; no understanding of succession. Correctly notes that oil tankers far at sea dump bilges with ten times more wastes than shoreline ail spills. Video then shifts from above the earth to deep below the sea and life in the abyssal region: 15 meter long siphonophore, food debris raining from above, a dead whale carcass laden with worms (probably nemerteans), an angler fish, ctenophore light displays, and thermal vents that ""exude toxic heavy metals."" [Hey, this is a natural phenomenon...why the ""toxic""? Again, this is representative of extremism rather than science.] Indeed, there is a lack of knowledge of our seas. Film returns to Corsica Cape where rock lobster fishermen are overfishing. Describes dilemma of fish consumption in France and Japan and concludes ""We are completely emptying the sea"" which of course is over the edge. In African Guinea Bissau, local fishermen are overfishing their lagoons while foreign trawlers off the coast are ""swiping"" their fish. Shows native religious ceremonies and old style of using low yield throw nets. New settlements on islands overfish as well. Greenpeace paints ship sides with ""stolen fish."" Narrator relative to the trawlers: ""No shoal of fish can escape them."" [Soulful music in the background is reminiscent of the big-eyed dog adds by animal rightists.] Finally, the video indicates that 50% of the fish we eat are farmed in ""fish farms"" and this brief segment along with the next is useful in biology classes.  The final scenes in this briefest of discs deal with the huge red king crab that was introduced in 1961 from the North Pacific where it had natural predators to the Barents Sea. Intended to supplement Russian fishing, this is filmed off of Norway. Since the price is set, it keeps harvests low and the footage of the masses of crabs is quite impressive.

Disc 4: Seas and Oceans Part II (51 minutes) The introduction briefly recapitulates some of Part I. Gannet colony with birds that mate for life and have one egg per cycle have moved to new territory. Plastic bags in sea take a toll on some sea life. GPS markers are used to track birds. Young gannets spend a week in sea near shore learning to fly. Footage of various sea disasters and bird loss. Next scenario is algae blooms in Brittany due to liquid manure and nitrate pollution. ""People must be ready to spend more to buy from ecologically-minded farmers"" summarizes the interviews with a farmer near the sea who sees the mussel farmers harmed by his land farming pollution. Pig breeding and density are switched to lower intensity farming. [This is a point where the future growth to 9 billion people by 2050 conflicts with lowering food production, a discussion that should occur here but which is missing.] The next scenario is the coral reefs of New Caledonia in the South Pacific, the second largest after the Great Barrier Reef. A beautiful array of corals are shown and zooanthellae are briefly explained. When corals die, it is ""white death."" A large nickel mine and waste pipeline will drain to one point at the shoreline [but if this is a huge reef, where is the proportionality?]. Efforts to educate children by snorkeling the reef are good [but cannot begin to reach a significant number]. Now we switch back to Normandy where 70% of hedgerows were removed from 1960-1980. Wind farms were also built. The effect of the Gulf Stream allows tropical gardens to flourish at the same latitude as Canada! But in geological history, global warming has shut off that Gulf Stream and changed ocean currents. Back to open oceans, where 7 of 13 species of whales are threatened with extinction. There is conjecture on the effects of global warming on krill, the major food for many whale species. There is a very brief footage of a baleen whale feeding on the bottom. Another short segment graphically shows whales mating. These segments are usable in science classes as are the following scenes and animations explaining the massive 13 meter spring tide and hydro-mills for producing energy from this surge.  In contrast, the Mt. San Michele island castle will silt up by 2042 so water management is used to wash away silt accumulations. Meanwhile, Venice faces sinking due to removal of underground water via wells and tides rising with the likelihood that by 2090, all former land of Venice will be underwater. Final scenes return to New Caledonia with pine islands, mangrove swamps and the heart-shaped natural region that is the photo featured on the cover of the disc-set.

Disc 5: Earth Part I (46 minutes) In response to the question of what to do since ""If everyone consumed as much a the French, we would need 3 earths,"" the problem is broken into the atmosphere (a global problem), toxins in the soil, and loss of 10-30% of species. We lose one species each 18 minutes. In the Amazonian Forest in Peru, deforestation is a problem. This video however mistakenly includes science collectors in the problem, which is not the case. Monkey orphans are rescued and rehabilitated. The problem with illegal bush meat in markets is described. There is no definition of domestication and no recognition of the ""born free"" problem with rehabilitating animals reared with people back into the wild. The cultivation of Amazonia pits colonists versus natives. The hype given to native medicines here goes well beyond the actual science. The next scene moves to a ranch in Montana, although it is called a ""farm"" in this video. They move from growing hay to using only rangeland and less fertilizer, again with no indication of lower production and consequences for a future highly populated world. An inaccurate contrast is made with feedlot operations and there is a general anti-meat message. The situation in Beijing and sandstorms in China in general is photographed, with its origin in Inner Mongolia. The actual massive reforestation efforts that have been made are underplayed. The next scenario is in California where vineyards and cornfields are the focus, with chemical farming the evil. Here again, there is simple-minded animal rightist philosophy corrupting the narrative. Finally in Brazil, a plane flies on ethanol made from the discards of sugar cane refineries. Ethanol, called ""green oil"" and touted as only 20% the pollution of petrol, is traced from harvest to refining with less pollution, but no accounting is given for inputs-outputs in other economies.  But it rightfully concludes that ""if everyone lived on ethanol, there would not be enough farmland.""

Disc 6: Earth Part II (61 minutes) Flying over the San Andreas fault shows its clear surface features and earthquake dangers. Los Angles highways and pollution are impressive.  The U.S. produces 25% of the earth's greenhouse gases but constitutes only 5% of the world's population. Good animation of the greenhouse effect. Shows ice core samples showing carbon dioxide levels over 650,000 years and loss of ice caps speeding up global warming. Next scenario is Florida  where Miami has swallowed up part of the everglades, with canals drain wetlands. 100 Florida panthers are left. Fertilizers cause eutrophic pollution. Restoration is underway to repair the everglades. Back to California, the view from above is from a wind turbine. Like nearly all wind advocates, this piece indicates absolutely no understanding of electrical resistance that prevent transmission over long distances. China is called #2 in carbon production, but passed the pint to become #1 3 years after this film was made. China heavily recycles and uses some biogas from human and animal wastes (video claims no carbon dioxide is produced but that is not quite correct). In China, 25 million use some biogas [but it simply cannot scale up and will remain secondary in a country of 1.3 billion). The video predicts an end of abundance to oil, and shows California's oil well operations with a predicted peak in 2020. Currently, 40% of world's energy is from oil. In Haiti, use of wood for energy has removed all forests and is contrasted with Dominican Republic where trees were protected. Charcoal si 72% of Haiti's energy sources. Lack of vegetation in turn means loss of soil. A new system of sustainable vegetable gardens on elevated piles is shown. Salt Lake City in Utah is the next location. Massive equipment is used in open pit mining of copper. Repairing and recycling is stressed for cell phones and overconsumption rather than conservation of metals. The extent of metal reserves are unknown.

In the small kingdom of Bhutan, Buddhism considers animals sacred. Instead of measuring success with GDP, they consider gross happiness the index. Some solar panels are used for electrical generation. By law, 60% is to remain forested, and reforestation is underway. In comparison to Salt Lake City housing, we return to France for the final discussion of the ""Ideal House"" near Paris.  It uses solar power, subterranean heat, some wood, and rainwater collection. Transport becomes the main energy problem and electric cars are a possible solution. Recycled products are to become clothing, etc. However, the video misses the enormity of 9 billion, a number that will require people to be stacked in skyscrapers rather than spread out over the remaining countryside in individual houses. For this segment, they should have visited urban China where consumption remains at one fourth Western consumption by building up, not out.

It is unfortunate that more scientists were not consulted in the production of this series. While some are interviewed for their specialty, the overall message is swamped by an uneven ultra-environmentalist and animal rightist propaganda line. And there is absolutely no excuse for having provided the Sea Shepard pirate captain with any legitimacy in this piece. It does give you a great appreciation for David Attenborough's work that is far more carefully based in science.",1419897600,3,19567,5.038627935723115
