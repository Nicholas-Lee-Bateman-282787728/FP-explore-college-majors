4708599,5,B005IA9JVS,Loved this movie (Toll of the Sea). The colour was amazing - and from 1922 unbelievable - with a standout performance from Anna Mae Wong. The titles were also beautifully written. Thoroughly recommended.,1393286400,,203,5.181818181818182

4708601,4,B005IA9JVS,"This Alpha edition of ""Toll of the Sea"" starring seventeen-year-old Anna May Wong has good picture quality and is very watchable. It was filmed in two-strip Technicolor, a rarity for a silent film from 1922.

""Toll of the Sea"" was MGM's first motion picture filmed in color. Also, the background music is well done and does not get in the way of the story.

The color in this ""primitive Technicolor"" film is pleasant and reminds me somewhat of ""TruColor"" used in some Forties and Fifties B-Westerns. This color process makes some blues appear green and some earth tones appear pink. But the overall variety of colors in this film is not bad and greatly adds to the enjoyment of a rare Anna May Wong drama.

Anna May plays Lotis Flower, a niave and trusting young woman who lives in China and is from an upper class family. One morning she finds a half-dead American on the beach near her home, a victim of a shipwreck. She has him carried to her house where she nurses him back to health.

In the meantime, she falls in love with the American and he falls in lust with her. After the American has recovered, Anna May thinks that she has married the man ""American style"" only to learn later that it was a ruse to get her into bed.

The Amercian eventually packs his bags and goes back to the United States, leaving Anna May behind, both heartsick and pregnant (a fact unknown to him). She has the baby and gives her son plenty of love and attention. When the villagers see her out with the child, they laugh at her behind her back for being so easily tricked by the American.

Two years later, when Anna May hears that her ""husband"" is returning to China, she thinks that it is to wed her ""Chinese style,"" only to learn that he is honeymooning with his young American bride. This event leads to a heartbreaking finale that shows why Anna May Wong is considered to be one of the greatest Asian-American actors who ever lived.

The only thing that kept this DVD from getting a five star rating is the ""bonus feature"" starring Gloria Swanson, another film great and one of my all-time favorite actors. The story is good, but the picture quality is terrible. It is blurry and dark and almost impossible to watch. So you may want to skip the so-called ""bonus"" and concentrate on the wonderful talent and beauty of Anna May Wong in ""Toll of the Sea.""",1318636800,17,2343,4.473067915690867

8474410,5,B005IA9JVS,"Considering this film was made in 1922 it is surprisingly viewable in terms of film clarity.  There are a couple of glitches where it stops but be patient, it gets going again.  The story is bittersweet and the acting is quite good.  I enjoy watching early cinema and see not only the movie but also the history made by the pioneers of the medium both in front of and behind the camera.

For me its a nostalgic thing to have, But is a love story, I lovely beautiful Chinese girls helps a man over board washed to sea. She falls in love with him and wants to Marry.. I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone. But this not very expensive movie and i think most Silent era movie fans won't be disappointed with this one..",1403568000,3,481,4.182795698924731
