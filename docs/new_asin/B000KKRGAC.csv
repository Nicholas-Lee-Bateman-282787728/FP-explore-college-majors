Now almost forgotten, C.O.D. (1981) (German title ""Snap"") was a staple of the old ""usa-up-all-night's"" programming.  The humor was a bit more sophisticated and satirical than most of their exploitation film selections; perhaps reflecting the German influence in the writing and the production.  And unlike most it had a quality cast,  some of whom have gone on to assemble impressive acting resumes.

Chris Lemmon plays Albert Zack,  a relatively dim young advertising executive whose client is the financially failing Beaver Bra Company. The company chairman believes the enterprise can be saved if Albert can get their bra line endorsed by famous busty woman. He has selected five celebrity women and the film consists of five separate segments with the blundering Albert and his female secretary / good-girl-love-interest (played by Olivia Pascal) devising ways to meet them and pitch the endorsement idea.  Getting past the escorts and security people involves an assortment of costumes and subterfuge. Working against them is a board member who wants the company to fail,  with the biggest laughs coming from his female associate's (played by Jennifer Richards) attempts to stop Albert.

Corinne Alphen and Carole Davis play two of the celebrity women.  They were arguably the two most erotic actresses of their decade and are both nicely showcased in their segments.  Both had an instinctive acting for-the-camera ability.  Former Penthouse Pet-Of-The-Year Alphen was the Nancy Kovack of the 80's,  with a remarkably low upper arm to bust ratio.  Even in this early role Davis radiates an intelligence and self-knowing whimsy that nicely complements her obvious physical assets.

The front-end-loaded pun refers to the ordering of the segments,  as Alphen and Davis are featured early and the other three actresses are simply not up to their standard.  Although ""The Toy's"" Teresa Ganzel does her standard airhead blonde quite competently. This peaking early is the film's only weakness,  with little to hold your interest after Davis' hilarious film-stealing appearance as the mega-erotic Contessa Bazzini.
