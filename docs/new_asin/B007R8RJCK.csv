8538908,4,B007R8RJCK,"If I were to rate it on how much my daughter loved these DVDs when she was 2 or 3, I'd give it 5 stars. Such a gentle show with cute characters, bright colors, and sometimes with little life lessons.

These are not the DVDs that have educational bumpers between the episodes from Nick Jr/PBS Kids. These are just Miffy episodes.

I wish more kids' shows these days were sweet and gentle, like this one. It's not exciting or loud, but it's most definitely cute and sweet!",1333411200,,470,4.390804597701149
