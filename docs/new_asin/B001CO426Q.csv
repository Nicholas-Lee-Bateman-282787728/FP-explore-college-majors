3514824,3,B001CO426Q,"Being a fan of Savini's work and having an interest in makeup effects, I requested (and received) this as a birthday present.  A few things that ought to be noted.

 First, this DVD is ripped from an interview shot in 1987, with the slightly murky video quality of the era- it looks like footage from a local cable channel.

 Secondly, while the product description drops hints that this is an instructional video, it's more of an interview interspersed with shots of the effects in action- that is to say, there are only the vaguest descriptions as to the construction and workings of each.  There's some brief talk about how each was made, and typically some shot of the end result (with some neat backstage archival footage), and the stories he tells are fun, but if you're looking for makeup instruction, you may want to keep looking.",1280534400,,838,4.705479452054795
3514825,5,B001CO426Q,This was a b-day gift for my husband who is truly into make-up and special effects and he was amazed and so was I,1271894400,,113,3.75
3514826,3,B001CO426Q,"I'm a huge fan of Tom Savini's work. Even met the guy a while ago while&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Dusk-till-Dawn/dp/6306004041/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Dusk till Dawn</a>&nbsp;was out. The guy is REALLY incredible at making blood and guts look real! With years of experience (and time in Vietnam as a photographer), he knows his stuff.

So when I came across this little film I was expecting something more than what I got. It's not horrible; I certainly learned a few things about many of his less popular movies. It's basically him in his studio with director John Russo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight/dp/B000A6T208/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Craving/dp/B0001Z3HVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Craving</a>, and I haven't seen either of these films) talking about how he comes up with ideas. It's interesting, but hardly educational.

You're probably better off with something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-Make-Up-Hosted-by-Dick-Smith/dp/B001CQ5GX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster Make Up Hosted by Dick Smith</a>, but since I haven't seen that either, I couldn't tell you.

If you're looking for a little insight into Savini's work, without much as to HOW he does it, then this VERY SHORT film is for you.",1224374400,6,1470,7.388571428571429
8288389,5,B001CO426Q,Tom Savini is a hero of mine. I will always purchase anything that shows how he does his magic.,1512777600,,95,4.052631578947368
8288390,3,B001CO426Q,"I really liked the interview with Tom. I love Tom's work. But it lists all the movies from the 80's. Very cheesey--but great! I even enjoyed watching this with my 12 yr old. If you have a child that is wanting to go into the F/X line of work, great, But don't show them this video UNLESS you are sitting with them and you only let them watch the interview with Tom. Then quickly take the dvd out of the dvd player and hide it well!!! Make sure your child does NOT get a hold of it or watch any other part of it! When we get a dvd, we look at every thing on it-even the ads for other movies. On this dvd, it goes right into the interview with Tom. (Thank goodness!) Then on the menu it shows Play, chapters, and another option. I clicked on it. I was so happy I had the portable player out! I had it turned towards me and what came on the screen was shocking! It looked like homemade horror movies that were almost porn. It listed around 6 movies and all were pretty bad. Full frontal nudity, 2 girls going at it and after that I shut it off. Please be careful watching this. It came sealed up, didn't looked like a bootleg or a copy or that it had been tampered with. Love ya Tom-but I wish your dvd didn't have things like this on there.",1432166400,,1238,4.036585365853658
8288391,3,B001CO426Q,"I love the work of Tom Savini, is the reason I like Horror SPMUFX, but this interview is not what I expected, the quality of the images are not the best and is a repetition of what I've seen on other videos from him.",1426723200,,216,3.9318181818181817
8288392,5,B001CO426Q,just what I wanted I would  recommend this to others it makes great gifts to others and friends very nice,1373760000,,105,4.25
8288393,2,B001CO426Q,I got this not reading the other reviews and I wish I had. I have recenlty got the idea to try to make some of my own halloween props and thought this would help me. Insted it was about an hour lon interview shot sometime in the 80's with scenes from movies he had shot up til that point. It doesn't really teach you anything and the stuff that they do show is probably long since out dated. The only plus side I found in this is that I can get him to sign the cover when I go to a horror convention in a couple months. I hope this helps future buyers of this item,1360454400,,564,3.8706896551724137
8288394,5,B001CO426Q,My grandson is into special effects makeup and has a lot of equipment related to this specialty.  He found this book to be interesting and helpful.  The author is one of his favorites so he was delighted to get it for his birthday.,1359849600,,231,4.348837209302325

8288396,5,B001CO426Q,I love this movie it's is a behind the scenes look at tom's work and you get a tour of his home it is so awesome buy it if your a fan of Romero and savini you won't be disappointed,1299283200,,180,3.525
8288397,1,B001CO426Q,"I got this as a present & i'm sad that someone wasted their money on it. It says ""Learn the techniques of the legendary make-up artist..."" but there are not demos, no instructions, just cheesy stories about mostly animatronics (which is not makeup) & squibs (again, not makeup.)
Complete waste of time & money. Lame.",1298764800,,316,4.763636363636364
8288398,2,B001CO426Q,"It's an interview.  I thought I was buying something that would actually ""teach"" me something.  The copyright date is 2008, but what it should say is ""I got taken out of a clip from the 70's.""  I'd like to get my money back- but I guess I should be more careful with my purchases.  Buyers beware!!!!!  Don't make the same mistake I made.",1293580800,4,337,4.285714285714286
