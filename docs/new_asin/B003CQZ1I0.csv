4110267,5,B003CQZ1I0,"UPDATED 4.13.15

UPDATE: I just wanted to add a little information about the program that Keith was talking about when he was on Joe Rogan's podcast. First, he was very clear that if you're doing the full routine, this is only meant to be done once per week. It's a very intense routine that requires some healing time for the body. He even recounted that the first day he filmed the routine the video was unusable, so he had to go back the next day and redo the whole thing, which was very difficult even for him. Keith is also a big proponent of intermittent fasting. He takes one day per week and eats nothing for an entire 24 hour period. There are several variations of IF. The science and studies are interesting. Just a few things to consider if you're thinking about this program or are a fan of Keith's and his completely ripped and functional physique. END UPDATE

Like many of the other reviewers, I too am a big fan of P90X and Insanity. Those are my standard routines that I mix and match to create a solid fitness regimen. But a while ago I wanted something more. When I saw that Onnit was releasing their Primal Bells (Kettlebells shaped like the heads of Primates) I decided this was the kick I needed to get into Soviet-styled fitness. There's just a certain allure to what is essentially an iron cannonball with a handle. Simplistic. Primal. The only thing missing was a routine to go along with it.

I started with the Skogg videos. They're great for beginners and his instruction into the basic movements is excellent. But I quickly got bored with the same 6 movements just repeated in a variety of different ways. And like the other reviewers, we've all heard Joe Rogan talk about how Keith's video, even just the first 20 minutes of it, is enough to destroy even the most fit men. So I picked it up. . . and I got annihilated.

This video is NOT for beginners. Heck, I'd say it's barely for intermediates. There's zero chance you're getting through this video unless your fitness is already in a very, very good place. There's no instruction on how to perform the basic movements. So if you've not done kettlebell before, go elsewhere and learn the fundamentals or you will hurt yourself (again, the Skogg vids are great, or there are plenty of Youtube vids that give out solid instruction). To do the video at Keith's pace, with a 44lb bell like he uses, is a rare feat. I've never tried it with more than a 36lb bell (and that is still an excruciating experience).

If I had to only do one workout for the rest of my life, it would be this one. It hits every muscle you have. It pushes your lungs to the point of exploding. It works all the joints and connective tissues. There is truly nothing better. When I started out I could only do the first three segments. Today, I can do all the segments but I have to take breathers in-between. I've yet to make it through the entire video at pace. But I will. And on that day I will go into nature and kill my dinner with my own two hands because no force on earth will be able to stop me! Ok, that may be an exaggeration. But in all seriousness, incorporating this video once or twice a week into your fitness regimen will do incredible things for you. I've never been challenged like this on a workout. The sequel is also an absolute nightmare. It, too, will kick you and leave you in the dirt gasping for air. But I prefer the first one to the second.

Don't buy it at this $99 price tag (currently what it's being offered from a third party on Amazon for as of this writing). Google around and get it for $30. While it's well worth more than $100, even I'm not enough of a capitalist to say that these sellers should be rewarded for their price gouging. It's out there, and it's worth searching for.

Enjoy the pain.",1401580800,28,3788,4.379800853485064
4110268,3,B003CQZ1I0,"Me: Busy father. Prior weightlifting experience. New to kettlebells. Have purchased 4 different DVDs from variety of instructors. My take on each is below.

Best: Sarah Lurie Iron Core Kettlebell
1) Disks one and two are good for novices (little or no experience with kettlebells). Sarah has excellent technique and is a good instructor.
2) Disks three and four provide several routines for beginning and intermediate users. Can grow with your fitness level by increasing weight of kettlebell.
3) Amazing value. You will not be disappointed.

Better: Jessica Huthmaker
1) Disk came free with a GoFit Kettlebell and provides a varied 25 minute strength and conditioning workout. Instructional portion of the DVD is average.

Good: Keith Weber Extreme Kettlebell Cardio Workout
1) 6 different workouts which range from 6-10 minutes long and can be combined into a superwork or (as I do them) pick and choose for 30 minutes total.
2) Not for beginners. Best for intermediate users. His ""core workout"" like his sunglasses is straight out of the 80s.
3) Nice variety.  Not a good value at $100 unless this is much different from the single DVD I have.

Terrible: Kettlebody by Brook
1) She had clearly heard of kettlebells before making these DVDs.
2) Exercises are performed too quickly and with poor form.
3) All 3 DVDs suffer from Brooks personality. ""More cardio, less lardio"" is a her ""motivational"" phrase.
4) Enough said.",1400284800,45,1423,5.038297872340426
4110269,5,B003CQZ1I0,"This is a very good DVD for beginners to advanced kettlebell enthusiasts. 7 workouts in all can be mixed and matched to create your own routine. Upper body, lower body & core work are covered. The pace is relentless and the workouts are 10-15 min. I can hit a quick workout before dinner or a marathon over the weekend. I highly recommend this DVD.",1372291200,7,348,4.453125
4110270,5,B003CQZ1I0,"This is one hell of a workout.  I have done everything from regular bodybuilding workouts, P90x, Insanity, and so on and I have found the pot of gold in this one.  Although it is a 45-minute workout (separated into 7 segments), it will likely take at least an hour unless you are already in incredible shape.  It will blast every muscle in your body, but once you get through it you will feel incredibly satisfied.  This is a simple workout DVD, and all you need is one single kettlebell.  I am a 5 foot 10, 155 lb man with 8-10% body fat and have been working out for 4 years before starting this.  I use a 35 lb kettlebell and can't imagine moving up anytime soon.",1368489600,8,666,4.246031746031746
4110271,5,B003CQZ1I0,Keith Weber is an animal.  I did just one of the 7 minute workouts in this program without taking a break in the middle and felt as if someone should give me a trophy just for surviving.,1357776000,8,186,4.027027027027027
4110272,5,B003CQZ1I0,"You know its real when you just do it. Focused sensical and to the point. In physical training there is little room for talk you just have to do and thats what Keith does. It most certainly does what its meant to do. Don't watch, do.",1356220800,4,233,4.086956521739131
4110273,5,B003CQZ1I0,"The only downside I have is the price is way too high, but the DVD is a legit workout. I'd consider myself in pretty good shape. I have worked out consistently for the last 3 1/2 years & I've done CrossFit for the last 2 1/2 years, & I'm pretty accustomed to high-intensity workouts. The first time I did this workout I had to drop down in weights from a 35 lb kettlebell to a 20 pounder and I barely finished. If they sold it cheaper I'd buy a copy for all my workout friends for the holidays.",1349049600,10,494,4.051020408163265
4110274,5,B003CQZ1I0,"I had also tried P90X to lose some weight and tone up but felt that some of the dvd's were a little silly and found myself getting bored of the workout. I then read a lot about Kettlebells and it seemed right up my alley. Instead of rubber bands and jumping around water bottles, all you need is a nice set of Kettlebells and a great dvd like this one!

The picture quality isn't the best but the workouts are hardcore and really workup a sweat fast. In 7 minutes you will be huffing and puffing. You don't need to drag out a chair or a pushup bar. Just follow his moves and you will be on your way to success.

A lot of people use this dvd and have found it to be excellent. Definitely a 10/10 for a strong overall body workout!",1336694400,17,729,4.055555555555555
4110275,5,B003CQZ1I0,"As far as home workout DVD programs go - i've done P90X and enjoyed it but thought i was going insane after awhile when i found myself saying all of tony's lines with him.  and then i tried Rip 60 and found myself not enjoying the guy's personality on that DVD - it really does make it hard to press play - i've found.

I really enjoy Keith Weber because all he does is tell you the moves and counts out the reps...thats it...nothing is forced, there is no fake rah-rah instructor-isms.

the workout is a beast and is something i will be doing for quite a while.  having little time, its hard to have days dedicated to select muscle groups - this is perfect if you have little time for a good workout, b/c your legs, arms, back, shoulders are all getting worked.

good stuff.",1334707200,20,775,4.280821917808219
4110316,3,B003CQZ1I0,Workout is not for beginners. It is difficult.  I enjoyed it except for  the lack of instructions describing  each move. The video should have had an introduction  for users because the workout is continuous once you begin,1494201600,,222,4.918918918918919

4110319,5,B003CQZ1I0,"I've been working out for a long time and thought I was in pretty good shape for a 52 year old. I guess I was wrong! I haven't been able to make it to the gym as much as I would like so I got some kettle bells. Looking for a good working, I stumbled on this and decided what the hell. Let's challenge myself. I've done 3 weeks with this video and while I still get gassed, I can at least keep up with Keith. I've started out with 20 lb bells but he is using 45 lbs I think. He is a beast! If you are looking for a good full body workout at home that will burn tons of fat, look no further.",1491868800,,589,3.6825396825396823
4110320,5,B003CQZ1I0,"The music is obnoxious (but I don't like ANY music when I work out--personal preference), but the DVD is nicely organized.  You can choose which combination of circuits to do, and the exercises are demonstrated with great form.  I use it primarily for finishers, or to really blast the cardio.  I have not done the whole DVD start to finish.",1489190400,,341,4.65
4110321,5,B003CQZ1I0,"New to kettlebells and I loved this work out.  I have done weight training as well as p90X in the past.  This is a great cardio work out that's still fun since you get to toss some weight around.  As someone who hates running, elipticals, ect., it is hard to find a cardio work out that I don't want to bail on in the first ten minutes.  This work out will have you gassed by the end without staring at a clock the whole time, waiting for enough to pass for it to count as a workout.

4110322,5,B003CQZ1I0,"This DVD is great!  I followed another reviewers advice and split the DVD into two workouts. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a great workout. I've bought some other kettle bell dvds and I like this one because Keith is all business!!!  No added frills like some of the other DVDs. I'm a busy mom of two kids and want my workouts quick, effective and to the point. I agree that this is not for beginners. I also liked that this was filmed on the beach. The DVD is a little pricey but I think worth it. You won't be sorry.",1486080000,4,551,4.140186915887851

4110346,4,B003CQZ1I0,"This is definitely not a workout for beginners.  I would recommend you have significant prior kettle bell experience.  You are an animal if you can do the entire workout from start to finish.

I split the video into two different days, Swing Workout, Turkish Getup, Leg Burner, Core Workout/Cooldown, on one day, and Manmaker, Slingshot, Upper Body Blast, Core Workout/Cooldown, on a second day.  I perform the workouts in that order.  The first day is 38 minutes, the second is 34 minutes.

Keith Weber actually goes too fast for me, so other than the Core Workout, I do not follow the video.",1482019200,9,593,4.764705882352941
4110347,2,B003CQZ1I0,"Kettle bells are unique and no matter what dvd, beginner or advanced, a workout video should come with an instructional ""how to hold and what not to do"" with kettle bells.

Poor sound and video quality for what you pay for,  as well.",1479427200,6,397,4.337837837837838
4110348,5,B003CQZ1I0,"Keith Weber is an animal! I have all three DVDs in his workout series. This one is the most challenging by far. The biggest difference is that he utilizes two kettlebells which increases intensity as well as routine variation. I highly recommend all of Weber's products. My only suggestion is that you start with one and/or two before moving onto the workouts in this DVD. Train smart, train hard!",1478476800,4,397,4.768115942028985

Use a lighter weight than you normally would if you plan on doing the entire workout from beginning to end (rather than break it down into the smaller workouts) or you may find yourself fatigued to the point of loss of control during the Turkish Get-Up segment.
