8163690,4,B000LQMD3A,"Good video about ECT, it was a little long and could have done with out so many images of movies and such that have given ECT a bad name-became a bit redundant so to say. But it does have good info and i like that it shows a real procedure.",1398470400,,240,3.82
8163691,4,B000LQMD3A,"As an incredible beneficiary of ECT I am very happy to see that there is at least one decent documentary on this subject. I appreciated most of the movie and will pass it around to friends and family. Especially those who may benefit or know someone who may benefit from ECT. However, I felt that it wasn't balanced. For most of the movie it showed many fictionalized snippets of Hollywood's dramatized, scary, and deeply stressful versions of ECT which looked incredibly painful. It took until the last minutes to show an ACTUAL procedure which looked very mild, gentle and peaceful. This scene looked very much like what I went through.

I suffered badly from bipolar disorder for 25 years until I tried ECT. After 8 simple and painless sessions over 2 1/2 weeks and 2 weeks of mild memory impairment it is in complete remission and still is 6 months later. I cannot believe how well this brain is functioning in so many areas of thinking, including memory. And being off the aggressive psychiatric drugs like Seroquel, Lamictal, and Neurontin is a godsend. I've lost 40 pounds, workout everyday, eat better, stress is almost nonexistent, I'm happy, clear thinking, playful, peaceful, and am applying for jobs. Where as last Spring I was constantly suicidal, housebound, and jobless for the umpteenth time. If it wasn't for pushing from family and a chance meeting of Kitty Dukakis at the airport I would not have taken the ECT because of my impression of it from the 1975 movie ""One Who Flew Over The Cukoos Nest"". This movie gives many others the chance to meet her and others who have gone through this procedure along with professional doctors who administer and leading scientists who study this subject in depth. Though there is an aspect that I would like to see changed, I highly reccomend this DVD.",1232668800,7,1809,4.798076923076923

8163693,5,B000LQMD3A,"I am currently receiving ECT treatments and I purchased this DVD last year before I began.  It is extremely informative!  I have shared this with the head nurse at the hospital (who is now recommending that all patients see the DVD if possible) that I go to as well as my therapist.
I have also shared it with close friends and family so that they understand that this ISN'T like ""One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest.
I felt very comfortable about having the procedure done after viewing this.",1192406400,16,489,4.545454545454546
8163694,5,B000LQMD3A,"When I was in high school, our psychology teacher showed a film about life in a mental institution in the late 70's or early 80's. It showed an actual ECT session. It was horrible, and I suffered from nightmares and anxiety attacks for months thereafter. (That teacher should have been fired).

This presentation however is nothing like that. It also shows an actual ECT session; however, this is of ECT as it is done today. Nothing scary. Nothing like Snake Pit or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.

What is fascinating are the patient and family interviews. Actual patients who are undergoing or have undergone ECT are interviewed and tell their stories. Most are PRO ECT, while a few who were treated when ECT was being abused are against it.

This is a very balanced presentation on the subject, and for patients who are suffering with severe depression for which nothing else has helped, this DVD may shine a bright ray of hope.

Highly recommend!",1179187200,19,951,4.745454545454545
