193248,4,1573623946,I had first seen this film on Cinemax and I immediately enjoyed it.  I got it right away when it was released on DVD.  Roy Scheider's performance as the President was effective and convincing.  I really liked the plot of the  film.  It kept me entertained and interested.  I didn't think that this was  a weak movie at all.  I personally liked this film very much.,964051200,4,364,4.409090909090909
193249,3,1573623946,"This is a modest action film about nuclear terrorism, though it is one in a long line of films starring Dolph Lundgren that feature average storylines enlivened by some above-the-average scripting and some  surprising plot twists. There is a diverting appearance in this one from  Montel Williams, the talk-show host.",962841600,,317,5.32
193250,3,1573623946,a great film terrific action scenes Dolph Lungren finally has the role he deserves action blended with comedy. Lungren Plays a hotshot army piolt who gets the unwanted job of following the president of the united states  everywhere carrying a black bag containg nuclear launching codes. The most  memorable scene in this film was the high speed chase cars driving off one  building to another. Sensational Entertaiment! I love this film!,960854400,,437,5.126760563380282

Great fun and gripping action. Got to give it credit for humour.  If you like action this is the film for you, and it isn't too haevy either.  Good stuff and not a bit on the boring side.",944438400,,339,4.121212121212121

7798427,3,1573623946,"The Peacekeeper (1997) is an action flick where a fairly solid cast, and some decent special effects, can't quite overcome an implausible lightweight story that is weighed down by some melodramatic elements.

Dolph Lundgren plays Major Frank Cross, a pilot who is in trouble for making an unauthorized mission.  To save his career, Cross accepts the job of safeguarding nuclear launch codes for President Robert Baker (Roy Scheider).  Almost immediately, Cross is targeted by a group of terrorists who steal a suitcase containing the launch codes from Cross's wrist.  Cross pursues the thieves across several rooftops, in a crazy car chase that is the action high point for the film.  Cross manages to take the place of one of the soldiers trying to kill him, donning his hood and taking his place in a helicopter.  This dumb stunt works, as the terrorists take Cross to a missile silo for a rendezvous with ex-Marine Lt. Colonel Douglas Murphy (Michael Sarrazin), the leader of the group.

Nearly everyone in the silo has been incapacitated or killed, except for Lt. Colonel Northrop (Montel Williams).  Cross makes a break from the terrorists, and teams with Northrop to try and stop the terrorists.  Murphy who wants revenge against the President for abandoning him while on a mission, launches a missile and destroys one of the country's most famous landmarks.  Murphy then forces the President to go to a cemetery, where he then demands that the President confess his sins, and then shoot himself live on the air, to prevent the launch of additional missiles.  Cross manages to disable one missile, but another is launched targeted at Washington D.C.  From there, it's a race against time to try and prevent disaster.

The Peacekeeper is a decent action flick, but there's nothing particularly noteworthy about it.  The look of the sets is predictable, and the battle scenes are pretty routine and superficial looking.  One amusing bit of technology is voice synthesizer used to trick Cross, run by a guy sitting on top of an elevator.  As usual, Dolph Lundgren is likeable, but not the smoothest of action heroes.  He gets the job done in a workmanlike manner, and has a mildly exciting extended fight scene with Christopher Heyerdahl.  Montel Williams does an adequate acting job, but isn't very impressive in the action department.  Although neither plays a particularly realistic character, the movie is bolstered by having Roy Scheider and Michael Sarrazin in the cast.  The melodramatic interplay between them however, doesn't quite work, and neither does Scheider's Southern accent.  With a rating is 2.5 stars, The Peacekeeper is perhaps worth a rental for Lundgren fans.",1312156800,,2684,5.082191780821918
7798428,5,1573623946,"This is a kind of movie I find interesting. An action hero like Dolph Lundgren with a special appearance like TV talk show host Montel Williams. That still means it's kick-ass. As for Roy Scheider, he was a great actor. May he rest in peace.",1283472000,,241,4.377777777777778
7798429,5,1573623946,I bought this movie on dvd because I remember seeing this movie on VHS quite some years ago and I really enjoyed it back then. I gave this movie 5 stars because the action and plot of this movie back then was original and the action was definitely something to talk about....I would advise getting this movie as it's worth every cent.,1273017600,,334,4.403225806451613
7798430,2,1573623946,"I've been a fan of Mr. Lundgren for some time, but no amount of devotion or admiration can effectively quell my dislike for Dolph's 16th feature film, ""The Peacekeeper"". Its status as a DTV release can't make up for just how mediocre this movie was. The fact that it was made under less-than-great circumstances (i.e. budget and film time were reportedly cut, and Dolph hurt his back during filming) really shows, and it's with no small amount of disappointment that I give this one over to oblivion.

The story: Frank Cross (Lundgren) a military Major who's earned a reputation for flying illegal humanitarian missions. The only assignment left to him is to guard the president's (Roy Scheider,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws</a>) ""black bag"" - a briefcase containing the computer to launch America's nuclear arsenal. A gang of mercenaries led by a vengeful ex-marine (Michael Sarrazin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Shoot-Horses-Don-t-They/dp/B0002KPHZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Shoot Horses, Don't They?</a>) steal the bag in order to unleash a nuclear holocaust on the nation, but unbeknownst to them, Cross remains on their trail.

""Peacekeeper"" is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;rip-off but it retains virtually none of the latter's merits concerning action, plot progression, or characters. Basically, the only noteworthy scene in the film is the nifty rooftop car chase, but besides that, it's all nonsense. When mercenaries shoot an armour-wearing Dolph with semiautomatic pistols, he sells it as though he's been hit by a wrecking ball; the fellow who chokes to death in the contaminated facility does so looking like he smelled a fart; and the climatic hand-to-hand fight between Lundgren and a henchmen is by far one of the sorriest scenes I've ever witnessed.

Despite the presence of TV host Montel Williams as Dolph's partner, there's nothing really great about any of the acting, but the script calls for dumb things of the performers...like the president agreeing to shoot himself on-air. Or the mercenary commander trying to be intimidating in any given scene. Or the terrorists blowing up Mt. Rushmore. Essentially, the second half of the movie becomes a waiting game of watching missiles blow things up, and at that point, I think most folks will lose attention. Not unlike Steven Seagal's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>, it turns to clich of the terrorist being rightfully angry about something but being thwarted by the more-righteous hero...but by then, I don't know if anybody will be awake enough to comprehend this.

To date, ""The Peacekeeper"" is the worst Lundgren film that I have ever seen, and I'm sorry to know that he can sink this low. Only devoted fans will find anything to like, here, and since I haven't seen it in any video stores yet, it will only be the personal libraries of these fans that you are sure to find this definitive stinker.",1212537600,,3256,6.010775862068965
7798431,5,1573623946,Another hit for Lungren! This movies contains car chases on top of buildings! Need I say more? Do not miss this action packed movie which I gave a five star rating.,1208131200,2,164,4.32258064516129
7798432,1,1573623946,"You can only suspend your disbelief so much.  This movie asks you to throw logic out the window to watch action scenes that are mediocre at best.

Sorry - you will have more fun watching Paint Dry than enjoying this POS movie.  Skip it - you will be happier you did.",1141776000,2,266,4.176470588235294

7798434,2,1573623946,"I read some where that Dolph had said something along the lines that they had run out of money and had only half a day or so to film the martial art scenes for the movie. Its hard to criticise Dolph for this one. The script is not very good to start with and Dolph is given very little to try and work with. The second half of this movie which suffers from badly staged action pieces, does not live up to the well staged and enjoyable first half. The plot is an obvious Under Siege rip-off. This one is watchable but Dolph has done better before and in later movies after this one. A better script and more attention to the action set pieces and this could of been a winner.",1097798400,,674,4.113636363636363
