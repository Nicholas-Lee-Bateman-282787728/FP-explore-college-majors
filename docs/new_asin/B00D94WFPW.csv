8590789,2,B00D94WFPW,"good show, a bit campy but ok.  but I recommend you find another source for it.  the set I got here came as 6 discs in a skinny box set where the discs are pressed in (!!!!) against each other and so they all have scratches right out of the box.  also in shipping the pressure was enough that the plastic holder in the box got broken and some of the discs were just loose in the box.  many of the episodes are not watchable and even lock up my player so I have to do a power on reset just to get them out of the player.",1462406400,,519,3.7777777777777777
