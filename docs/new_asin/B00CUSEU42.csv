Thanks!",1489708800,,60,5.777777777777778
8586633,5,B00CUSEU42,I love this DVD. I have no cancer BUT used it as my first work out DVD because I needed some beginner strength training. It was a gentle starter program and effective for me as I really never strength trained before. My only (slight) complaint is there could have been some information on what equipment I would need so I could have been ready.,1489104000,,344,4.390625
8586634,5,B00CUSEU42,I'm a CPT and recently became a Cancer Exercise Specialist.  I understand the importance of using the appropriate exercises for each individual.  Carol's strength training video is very informative and stresses the importance of using a progressive approach when going from regaining range of motion to beginning resistance work.  A must-have!  It's a valuable addition to my exercise reference library.,1401753600,,403,5.666666666666667
8586635,5,B00CUSEU42,"I bought this video for my friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer. She never used weights prior to her diagnosis.  This DVD has taught her the importance of adding strength training to her routine. She had started  walking, but remained depressed and lacking energy. I encouraged her to do more as her Doctor sighed off on exercise. It wasn't until she started adding the exercises in this DVD that she began to feel stronger.  It also helped her with weight loss. I recommend this Recovery Fitness DVD!",1373241600,2,508,4.75
8586636,5,B00CUSEU42,The exercises in Recovery Fitness Strength Training-Getting Started.....are an important component of an effective exercise program for a cancer survivor or anyone that would like to gain strength. The DVD is easy to follow.  It is a good way to learn some of the basic strength training exercises.  When I return to the gym I will have a better understanding of strength training and I will have more confidence both physically and mentally.,1372636800,,442,5.041095890410959
8586637,5,B00CUSEU42,"I found this DVD to be incredibly useful. a friend had turned me onto the first DVD by Carol Michaels on stretching and I loved it, so was excited to try this DVD as well. I liked the pace and the fact that you didn't have to be a superstar to be able to do the exercises. She went over them in a good pace and organized fashion. You don't have ot be recovering from cancer for this DVD to be valuable. I showed it to my 85 year old father who needs to be building up his strength as well and he too felt it was fantastic
I strongly recommend this video for anyone recovering from cancer but also anyone starting up their exercise program",1371600000,3,638,4.071428571428571
8586638,5,B00CUSEU42,"This cancer exercise strength training DVD is extremely helpful. If you are ready to build strength and muscle, then this DVD is for you. The exercises in this DVD are for those that have gained their range of motion and are ready to get stronger. This strengthening program will help get you back to the activities that you enjoy.",1369612800,2,331,4.627118644067797
