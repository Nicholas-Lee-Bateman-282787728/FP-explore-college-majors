It dragged throughout, had terrible voice acting, sub-par animation, and bad overall production quality. I feel like I wasted my time and money on this series. I hope that no one else makes that mistake. Please don't buy this series. The only things it has going for it are decent action, and cool character designs.",1355616000,,454,4.617283950617284
