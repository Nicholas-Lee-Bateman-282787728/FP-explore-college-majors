8539858,5,B009D3D322,"Awesome video! Can do half hour or hour ride, with or without the instructor guiding you as to what to do and when.  The 10 minute cool down is just you and the wonderful scenery; the whole workout goes by so fast!  I plan to buy several more from this series.  Love the fact that it's in first person viewing.  Some other companies videos have you in a pack of riders and you have to look past the riders in front of you to see the views... not the case here, it's like you are really on the ride... even got a little vertigo in the really high mountain areas, it's so realistic!",1406592000,3,580,4.106194690265487
