1638229,4,B00005O0TC,I just started watching Queer as Folk a few months ago and I'm hooked. I think Gale Harold is one of the sexiest men I've ever seen. Hal Sparks is also a cutey and the guy who plays Emmett is adorable. This show is so choice. If you have the means I highly recommend picking up the video.,1005696000,3,288,3.9827586206896552
1638230,2,B00005O0TC,"I loved the original Queer as Folk series.  Great characters.  Interesting plots.  Terrific writing and performances.  And, although Stuart was a truly reprehensible character, he was fascinating to watch and I believed him.  On top of that, as someone who works in the comic book industry professionally and was a Doctor Who fan in my youth, I identified with Vince (perhaps a little too much on too many levels).  I was so caught up in the original series on DVD that I watched the last four episodes in one sitting; I found it that compelling.
I couldn't wait to see the follow-up.  I have to admit that I came away very disappointed.  There were numerous individual scenes that were powerful and/or funny, but they were not bound by a cohesive plot nor by consistent characterization.
If I were to sum it up in one quick explanation, I would say it suffers from the ""Broadway Damage"" syndrome.  (""Broadway Damage"" is a gay romantic comedy which is a flawed movie that I still enjoy.  The biggest problem is that the movie has the ending that the audience wants it to have, but does not make sense in the context of the characters as they are presented.  ""Free Enterprise"" suffers from a similar problem.)  In this case, the movie has the ending that I think the author thought the audience would want, but to be honest, I thought it was wrong on many levels.  (Or, perhaps it's the ending the author wanted it to have, but didn't know how to get there in a believable way.)
I should also note that the blurb on the back of the DVD packaging paints a much different picture of the contents than is what is actually contained in the 90 minute movie.  The description makes the movie sound like a suspenseful thriller, which it is not.  The blackmail plot, while one of the more interesting elements, is merely a subplot that totals maybe eight minutes of screen time.  And the whole ""Stuart crossing the law for revenge"" element is not anything like it sounds, and does NOT tie into the blackmail plot directly.  (Such as it is, it's also not one of the more believable elements, either.)
I find it curious that writer Russell T. Davies, who created such rich, interesting, and believable characters for the first series could undermine them so thoroughly in the follow-up.  Not only does Stuart spin completely out of control to the point of being unbelievable even in the context of Stuart (his whole ""revenge"" plot doesn't make much sense in terms of his character.  His motivation is murky at best, and I didn't buy it at all).  Hazel and Bernie stoop to illegal activities in order to help Vince in what I believe was intended to be a humorous side story, but only succeeded in undermining their characters.  Nathan shows brief glimpses of a working brain, but remains more dedicated to his reproductive organs (which is in keeping with his character, so I can't object to this).  And Vince--well, he doesn't seem to learn anything.  Every time it would appear that he has finally grown up and realized that his obsession with Stuart is unhealthy and counterproductive, he immediately caves in and goes back to being whipping boy/lap dog.  It all leads to a conclusion that I didn't like nor believe.
The cast remains charismatic, in spite of the material with which they are given to work.  The direction is solid.  The sheer filmmaking of the final scene in Manchester was visually interesting (although I kept wanting to hear the sound of Doctor Who's TARDIS in order to tie the images together with Vince's character, but alas, such was not to be.  At least that would have tied elements together, although how many people outside of the UK would have understood that reference is questionable).  The editing was solid.  Locations well chosen (although I'm not convinced they used the same set for Stuart's apartment.  It didn't look the same to me.  I did miss seeing Vince's home.  He was defined only by his job in this installment).  All in all, a well produced movie, but at its core is a script that doesn't quite work.  Too bad, really.
Stick to the original.  A great investment of time and money.  Rent the follow up first to be sure you want to purchase it.",1004054400,44,4178,4.659836065573771
1638231,5,B00005O0TC,"This is the best and most faithful depiction of gay characters you will ever see on television, full stop (to use the Brit's slang from the film).
Writer Russell T Davies knows the gay life and how to express it in a very unpolitical way. Russell got it right in his writing. The actors, directors, editors, sound, etc. hit the mark to make a glossy, polished TV show.
Forget the stretch it to the limit, superficial, they-missed-the-entire-point American Showtime version; this is the real deal. Don't get me wrong, the Showtime version is good, (I love Debbie (Sharon Gless)) but it has much more violence, with more sex and moves at a dull pace when you put it up against the British version.
Gay or straight, if you're not infuriated, saddened, moved or provoked by this show, you'd better check and see if you have assumed room temperature.
I found added insight to the series when I read the scripts
(amazon.uk) and viewed the documentary ""The Boys of Manchester"" on VHS tape.
Series 2, the finial episode is somewhat darker then the first series and the ending, WOW what an ending. You got to see it for yourself. Best money I ever spent. I'll be watching these DVD disks for years. (This text refers to the widescreen version series 1 & 2 from the UK.)",999129600,31,1260,4.604444444444445

7948090,5,B00005O0TC,Good snowy day tv.  Think gay sex in the city. In England. Much better than the us version.  Wish there were more episodes.,1360454400,,123,4.304347826086956
7948091,3,B00005O0TC,"I saw the Showtime series first, and then ordered these. I would suppose that, if you watch them in reverse, you might enjoy this series a little more. This was the original that kicked-off the more risque series on Showtime and I didn't enjoy it as much. Still, overall a great series, and ground-breaking in its own right.",1358812800,,324,4.603448275862069
7948092,4,B00005O0TC,"Having seen the US version, I was curious to see
the British version (which I understand was first)
  Interestingly, the US version chose not to retain
any of the character names, and their characteristics
are generally different. I liked it.",1349136000,,242,5.025
7948093,5,B00005O0TC,"This set really doesn't feature any episodes of the original ""Queer as Folk"", but instead is a ninety minute movie that serves as the series' finale. Without giving away any of the plot for those who have not seen it yet, we see how our beloved characters Stuart, Vince, and Nathan one last time as their stories unwind. I have to admit although this show only ran for ten episodes I was saddened by its abrupt demise; even the American version managed to produce 83 episodes so I have often wondered why Russell T. Davies (the creator) refused to make more ""Queer as Folk"". Still, if you own the first set of ""Queer as Folk"" you have to purchase this one as it's the companion to the series.

 The good news too is if you don't want to shell out the huge bucks for both ""Queer as Folk"" DVD sets the studio that owns it is releasing the entire series in one complete package during the summer of 2011 so that is wonderful news for consumers. I also have to add if you haven't watched the American ""Queer as Folk"" please do; to me it's just as good as the original and ran five complete seasons and all are available on individual box sets or in one complete package.",1294272000,,1166,4.319634703196347
7948094,5,B00005O0TC,"You have to be British to imagine such a soap opera, what do I say, A Coronation Street centered on gay people moved from the London East End to Manchester's Canal Street. But at a time when the Germans in Berlin are inaugurating a monument in honor of the pink triangles of the Nazi concentration camps, it feels good somewhere in your heart or soul. Are we finally opening the doors of all our cabinets and letting them come out and live just like anyone else? Are we finally starting the real aggiornamento that will bring everyone out and equal on the same main street, on the same bulwark to freedom, a destination that will always be a destination because there will always be some more freedom to conquer, some more way to go. But this series has gone a long way indeed. But the best part of it is how the series shows all the warped visions of the world, and there are many, the various generations of gay people, and there too there are many with many shades and hues, have grown, cultivated, bred and even amplified into some kind of both forbidding and apocalyptic myth, one of these misty myth some consider the acme of truth like the a*** being for s***, forgetting that the p*** must also be for p*** and the mouth for spit. The whole palette of gay bashing individuals is exposed though most of the time in passing notes, except at the end when 15 year old Nathan has the courage to expose a straight high school tourist who has come with his girl friend to that gay bar though he spends his time at school bashing the boys that are weaker than him and look slightly different from him, which is easy since he is a bigot. At the same time the series shows how having been forced to remain clandestine for so long, these young or not so young gay men have become unable to accept the simplest human relation that has ever existed between two or even more than two individuals, love, the famous libido, that attraction for the other, that appeal that only looks for tenderness and togetherness. And there the distortions are numerous: the butterfly that compensates his fate by fluttering from one bloom to the next and becoming a predator; the shy guy who is and has been in love with his school friend for more than fifteen years and cannot just accept it because the other is the one playing the butterfly-predator and has been since the very moment the two met; and the fifteen year old who just feels lust but discovers that lust is fun but it is always short lived and it requires running as fast as the wind from one desert to the next, from one erg to the next in the never ending sands of a lust-filled life. The film though shows him as a kid who makes his point and remains a kid and runs away from his anti-gay father, from his tolerant mother, from all his friends to go to London and what, tell me please, what on earth that he does not have there in Manchester? And yet all around these three there are plenty more who are just crossing the screen without any detailed resumes but we can imagine it is the same for them, be they playing now and then the drag queen, the sad discreet boy or man who is in love but does not have the guts to fight for it, or thinks that money can buy anything. Wrong. It is a lot more important to know all the actors who impersonated Doctor Who, a cult series but only, or should I say mainly, in GB. Of course since it is a British series the acting is a lot better than the various US soap operas because in Great Britain it is an honor for an actor to be on a TV series, in a film and on a theater stage simultaneously. Television series are not in any way a sloppy disgrace. British TV series are gems of their own merit.

7948095,5,B00005O0TC,"I loved it!!!! Simular to the American counterpart; different names etc.  Stuart=Brian; Vince=Michael, Nathan=Justin. Stewart is much darker and sinister than Brian; even going as far as blowing up a car;(I loved that scene)and confronting his relative who is trying to blackmail him. Its a bit difficult understanding the British lingo at times but if you watch foreign films you come to expect this. Nathan is 16 and as cute as Justin, has a face to face confrontation with his instructor in a prep school over his sexuality that truely has to be seen to be appreciated. The American version has more of a plot to it but, British version has more intense scenes which I enjoyed. A good film to have in your collection and I plan to purchase all of the British versions of QAF.",1097539200,,778,4.678832116788321
7948096,4,B00005O0TC,"I thought this was an excellent follow up to the first series.  Sure, it was a little outlandish at the end (the Thelma and Louise feel to it was amusing), but the characters are so endearing, complicated, sympathetic, and appealing that I still enjoyed every minute of it.  I was disappointed and incredulous that there was only one disk in the box, as I expected to get another four episodes out of ""Series 2"" -- sadly, it was just one movie.  But it did wrap up a lot of the strands from the first series, and I felt satisfied by the weird ending.  For fans of the first series, I think it is well worth watching.  (If you weren't a fan already, there's no point.)
I prefer this series to the American version any day of the week -- but then, I am generally a fan of British film and TV, and I generally hate American TV.  So there's my bias.  Also, I watched the British version first, so I was already digging the Brits before I started watching the American series.  Brian and Michael were doomed from the start for me -- they just can't measure up to Stuart and Vince, in my book.",1023926400,,1087,4.2682926829268295
7948097,5,B00005O0TC,"I found myself holding my breath at times during this final part of the series. The story line is bold, quite disturbing at times, even alarming. It's not happily ever after. But I LOVED IT. I couldn't believe how exciting it was. It's not what you expect. If you want a gushy love story, go back and read Gordon Merrick. This, however, may shake you up a bit.",1018310400,7,360,4.3088235294117645
7948098,5,B00005O0TC,"This was truly a ground-breaking series.  The frank portrayal of gay life (albeit controversial) set a precedent for the acceptance of gay people in more mainstream media.  It paved the way for the American series, which is less artistic than the British and more a la Days of Our Lives, yet still entertaining.  The acting in this series is superb, and the casting is realistic.  It isn't like in American movies where everyone looks artificial.  It is definately worth the price.",1014076800,4,481,4.888888888888889
