8203543,4,B000S0G1GY,"Some ""thinking outside the box"" hockey ideas that
leagues, coaches and parents should review. The practice
organization has purpose, meaning and gives results!
CHAMPIONSHIP HOCKEY DRILLS will make you feel like throwing
your hat on the ice in celebration! Excellent stuff!",1289520000,,272,5.658536585365853
8203544,4,B000S0G1GY,"Love this program!
Love those Leslie brothers!
With any youth hockey program,quality ice time
management is a must. This program is like a
Bobby Orr slap shot from the ""blue line"".
Recommended but we need some more instruction
on changing shifts during games and
transition from one drill to the next in practice.
Other that that, this program rocks!

This video is well directed and follows structured theories about how to run ice hockey practices with limited room on the ice. A ""hat trick"" in every sense of the word for a product that should be required by all hockey coaches and leagues  everywhere.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1248566400,,384,4.647058823529412

8203549,5,B000S0G1GY,"CHAMPIONSHIP HOCKEY DRILLS was incredibly helpful when my son began playing the sport and we ended up getting so hooked that we started attending collegiate as well as professional hockey games. Our league now requires all coaches to view this video. The format was very easy to follow, so no matter what you want to learn about hockey practice organization, this has it!
Ice Time Management is an issue anywhere you pay huge ice time fees. Watch this and you will save money and have better practices.
This is the best resource for coaches and leagues looking to get the most out of a 60 minute (or longer) practice.
This wonderful video gets two thumbs up from me and I highly recommend it.",1245542400,,692,4.634146341463414
