88054,3,0790724960,"**Update**
I showed this movie to my nieces (who were 6 & 8) and we had to fast forward through 50% of it.  The Witches Council scene towards the end is very scary and most of the scenes in general are dark and creepy. I would absolutely not recommend it for kids.  I wrote the review below based on my own recollection of the film, but through an adult's eyes, I now feel differently.  Times have changed, and I no longer feel this movie is appropriate.  As mentioned below, the ending isn't even something to look forward to as the movie teaches vindication and the existence of evil.  The girls are cute, but I'd pick something else.

**Original review**
As a girl born at the end of 1985, there isn't much Olsen-related media I'm not familiar with. I remember this movie first airing on television, so I must have seen it when I was about 7 years old, and I can tell you with 100% certainty that I wasn't slightly scared or alarmed by anything in it.  Although, please also keep in mind that my favorite movie as a pre-schooler was Savannah Smiles (about a girl who befriends her kidnappers) and in kindergarten I sat in the front row of Space Mountain without so much as wincing.

That being said, I've always been slightly befuddled about the incredibly dark tone that this movie takes on... there are several scenes where the girls are wandering around alone at night and everyone that they encounter is creepy in one way or another.  One of the twins is also basically evil until the end.

I'm not exactly sure how to rate this film though because as a kid, this was my favorite Olsen TV feature (I liked It Takes Two better overall), but now as an adult, it bothers me that the girls seek revenge on their older aunt by keeping her trapped in the mirror at the end (could have been a good place for a lesson in forgiveness) and I find many of the themes pretty mature for a child audience.  Although my nieces (ages 6 & 8) are big Mary-Kate and Ashley fans now themselves (my sister thanks me daily for that), I'm hesitant to show this to them without watching it all the way through again.  So that means I'd have to watch it twice...  Not really what I look for in a kids movie.

Overall, I think that this movie was pretty good for the times, but people tend to be much more careful now about the kind of media that their kids are exposed to, and I think this one might be stuck in the level of appropriateness for 1993... It's too bad because I'd love to find a good Halloween movie that isn't too scary but also isn't completely lame or a cartoon!",1350000000,2,2561,4.3417190775681345

Cloris Leachman steals the show as the evil witch whose snarky put downs are as dangerous as her curses.  Enough scares to make it interesting but no one gets hurt and the ghouls and goblins will frighten only the most timid children.  A brief dated moment when the kids mention they watch Phil, Oprah, and Sally Jessie on TV.

88070,5,0790724960,"As a child, I loved this movie, Olsen twins, and HALLOWEEN. Now that I'm older, I still do! The twins star as Lynn and Kelly. Their parents are about to lose their house. They ask Aunt Agatha for a loan, but because she's an evil witch, she doesn't. During that time, the twins meet a grave digger who tells them about the Moonstone, which gives Agatha her power. Agatha had a nice, sweet twin sister named Sophia, who is trapped in a mirror in the attic. On HALLOWEEN the next day, The twins try to find the witches' gathering, get the Moonstone, and save their sweet aunt by midnight with the help of Mr. N, Oscar the Clown, and the grave digger. If you love the Olsen twins, witches, and HALLOWEEN, you'll love DOUBLE, DOUBLE, TOIL AND TROUBLE!!!",1220659200,,749,4.434782608695652
88071,5,0790724960,"So I bought this after not having seen it since I was a child and was so excited for it to come. The Olsen twins are just a year older than me so I pretty much grew up with them. I will say when I was little, like six or seven, and watched this it really scared me. But now after watching it again over ten years later I have to admit it's still awesome! Definitely perfect for Halloween or any other time of the year.",1200787200,,418,3.872093023255814
88072,5,0790724960,The Olsen twins star in this great tale of halloween adventure. Their family is going through some tuff financial trubles and may lose their house so they turn to the only member of the family with any money- a cruel aunt. Upon arrival they are immediately dismissed- but the young twins presence frightens the mean aunt because she was once a twin herself and she did something very horrible to her own twin. See- their cruel aunt is a witch and used a spell to make her twin vanish and now its up to mary kate and ashley to uncover the plot and save someone they have never met. They find help with a little person and a grave digger and set off around the town trying to learn more about their evil aunt's witches coven. Great for all families with younger children and worth many watches.,1167004800,5,792,4.394557823129252

88077,5,0790724960,"I loved the movie. I am a big fan of the olsen twins. I have liked them since they were in Full House as babies. They are so cute and I am going to keep bying their movies until they stop making them. They are such a joy to watch on tv considering all of the bad junk that is on tv these days. I have a 3 year old child who loves the olsen twins as well. she gets me ot go out and buy them when she
sees them advertised on the tv. Elizabeth",1037923200,15,440,3.59375
88078,5,0790724960,"This is my favorite Olsen movie that they have made, mainly because unlike so many of their more recent movies, it has a good plot and a very good supporting cast. The plot sends 7-year-olds Lynn and Kelly on a Halloween night mission to get a magical moonstone from their evil aunt who has cast a spell on their other aunt. Fun for little kids, but also enjoyable for older fans. It's a good movie to pull out around Halloweentime (or whenever) and at 17 years old, I am not ashamed to watch it because it is truly one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's better movies. I guess the reason I think that is because of the stronger recognition of the other characters--they really get a more substantial role in the movie than the surrounding characters in some of MKA's other movies. In this film, you'll fall in love with the endearing gravedigger, the money-hungry yet lovable Mr. N, and the supportive, ""take charge"" Oscar the Clown. And then you've got the girls' parents--who, for once, actually act like parents. Gentle, loving, good people--and yet they have problems of their own that they must get through as a family. Now you start to get the feel of a real movie with a real plot. Too many of Mary-Kate and Ashley's movies either have them with single moms or dads(which there is nothing wrong with at all, but it got a little repetitive with the Olsens) or completely up-in-the-clouds parents who were practically at their feet doting on them and giving them everything, thus showing the viewer exactly what life is NOT like. This movie is one exception where the casting of the girls' parents is very strong and realistic. After seeing enough of their other films, you may grow to appreciate seeing this. I am a long-time fan of these girls' films--have been ever since their memorable Full House days. But if you're looking for a quality Olsen movie, I'd recommend that you go for the ones from their younger years--this one may be your best bet. But that's only my opinion.",1034380800,37,1977,4.635327635327635
88079,5,0790724960,Very cute and hearwarming. Mary-Kate and Ashley are sick of being twins and wish they could not look alike. Later they learn that being a twin is very special. A very cute little movie. Great for the whole family. They were so cute in this movie. They were adorable when they were younger.,1011312000,3,289,4.471698113207547

88081,3,0790724960,"A nice movie starring the Olsentwins. It's certainly not their best movie, but it's way better than those party and adventure video which lack all story and are only good because the Olsens are such great actresses for  their age.
DDTT is a nice Halloween movie full of witches and magic. Mr N  (""These people have been reading to much Stephen King"") rulez,  but the twins rule more!",930787200,3,383,4.602941176470588
