Nothing demanding of you, but you may be of an age when newer movies of that type are just plain dumb. This is perfect. It has good actors and is erotic. You may never look at an orange in quite the same way again.",1474243200,2,302,4.135593220338983
7810512,4,6301151089,"From the trailer, I was expecting a really bad 80s campy film. I was surprised I actually ended up liking it. Nice twist I wasn't expecting. I would say it surpassed my expectations, but they were pretty low so it far exceeded them. Definitely a very 80s experience, interesting and omg, oranges... Worth a visit. Patricia Charbonneau should have been more of a household name, she has a lot of presence.",1470700800,,404,4.704225352112676

7810515,5,6301151089,This is an exceptional and original movie. Well worth your time if you are an adult. You will never think about oranges in the same light again.,1426809600,,144,4.37037037037037
7810516,2,6301151089,"I could only watch about 20 - 25 minutes of this movie before turning it off.  Poor acting, poor story line.  Plain poor movie.",1374451200,4,127,4.25
7810517,3,6301151089,"Super cast can't save a disappointing erotic thriller.  But everyone is in there giving it their best shot.  Patricia Charbonneau, now why didn't she ever become a star?  She's good at acting and she's beautiful too.  Maybe mass audiences were put off by her coldness and the slightly nasal quality of her speaking voice.  Wonder what she's doing today.  As her best friend, Patti D'Arbanville is also very good in a thankless part.  Watching CALL ME you can see why Patti never really hit it big, she's too plain, everything she has Teri Garr had twice as much of and did it ten times better, but still she's pretty good.  As the plot unfolds we see Patricia Charbonneau getting an obscene phone call in New York, and she gets so turned on by the man's voice, that she follows his instructions to the letter.  Sort of like an old fashioned version of the recent Meg Ryan flop by Jane Campion, IN THE CUT.

The men in CALL ME are great and they include David Straithairn who made all those John Sayles movies, and also Steve Buscemi, so you see they could have borrowed some of this footage for the last season of THE SOPRANOS and shown Buscemi and Straithairn in flashback as young men.",1092355200,8,1187,4.5046728971962615
