2799134,5,B000OQDSFY,"I am a grandmother of quadruplets born prematurely at 29 weeks. ""Little Man"" is the only film I have ever seen that shows the reality of what a family goes through when a precious little one is born too soon. A lot of the film follows Nicholas in the NICU, and then the film shows the impact on Nicole and her family when Nicholas is discharged home on oxygen, an apnea monitor, and breathing treatments, and what it's like to deal with running a mini-ICU in the home. I had never seen that portrayed in any film before, as unfortunately, that is the reality with most preemies, along with surgeries, multiple meds, and feeding challenges.  Nicholas had more medical problems come up in time and the film follows the changes in the family that occur as he struggles. This is a compelling, beautiful, and poignant film and I highly recommend it.",1179964800,18,844,4.589403973509934
2799135,3,B000OQDSFY,"I am also a mother, and I have been very lucky with my child. She did have a rare illness called Chronic Vomiting Syndrome for about 4-5 years (age 7-12), where she would throw up 10-12/x a day for 7-10 days straight, once every couple of months. There was no clear trigger, which made it difficult; it's hard to watch your child suffer like that. It converted to Migraine with aura at 12, which is a common course of the illness. So I can sympathize somewhat with the difficulties, though the levels aren't even close to comparable. The strength and courage of raising a micro-preemie is incredible, and knowing how hard my daughter's illness has been (she is now 16), it's not even close to what Nicholas deals with on a daily basis.

And this is my ultimate problem with this movie. It's not kept on the level of the interaction of parent and child; the slow damage to the overall family becomes, to me, an unshakable shadow hanging over the entire film. It saddens me for everyone, because I understand all points of view. The choices and actions people face in their lives are often not easy, not what they signed up for, and not what they agreed to in the beginning. That is the secondary tragedy woven throughout this documentary.",1409875200,,1237,4.572072072072072
2799136,5,B000OQDSFY,"I have read so many comments about this DVD. I don't think I've seen one that was derogatory. This story is heart wrenching and joyous all at the same time. Just when you think the worse is happening, Nicholas comes back.

I am a great fan of Nicole Conn and care very much about her, so  it is hard to watch her, and Gwen too,  go through the pain of living this  I have kept up with Nicholas's progress and am happy to say he is now 12 years old. I am also happy to say that very soon, there will be a sequel to this story.

2799138,5,B000OQDSFY,"It was incredible to watch and hear such a 360 review of the impact of so many decisions made with the highest of hopes and the best of intentions.  Watching this couple absorb each new development, trying to support each other even when they were at odds of what road to take.  This movie showed over and over the strength needed for a family to grow in times of incredible sadness, blame, joy and hope. At many points I was ready to declare one person wrong and the other right, only to find my mind opened to the faith and reasoning behind each side. This documentary is so well edited and shaped that I actually felt the pull from all sides.  I am left with sympathy for both moms, their daughter and beautiful son.  I know I would have cut and run on this child, this relationship, this life, but the movie really takes you through how to make peace with fear and the consequences of the path you chose.  Just awesome. Glad I bought it.  I will share with my family.",1398038400,,971,4.3076923076923075

2799147,5,B000OQDSFY,"Little Man is an unforgettable, brilliant and often sad documentary by filmmaker Nicole Conn. The film shows the incredible stress and strain that Nicole and her cherished partner Gwen Baba face when their second baby, Nicholas, is born to a surrogate mother one hundred days too early. Practically everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong; Nicolas even from the start has a chance of survival at just a small fraction of one percent; he must fight daily for survival in the NICU. The surrogate mother had not been honest with Nicole and Gwen about her health, either! The story moves along at a very good pace; I wasn't ever bored. Indeed, as the film progressed I was increasingly glued to the screen to find out the rest of the story. The cinematography is nothing short of excellent and kudos to the wonderful, angelic staff at the hospital that not only saved the baby's life but who also allowed the cameras to roll eventually forgetting that the cameras were even there!

Nicole Conn fights hard for Nicholas; she is constantly at the NICU and makes endless phone calls to a myriad of doctors to do everything she can to save her baby. Nicole wanted Nicholas so badly; and it's sad to see the toll his health problems take on Nicole's relationship with Gwen. Another unhappy development is Gwen's gradual disdain for Nicholas because, as Gwen puts it, now that Nicholas is born the ""fun"" has gone out of her relationship with Nicole. Nicholas essentially and completely innocently comes between Nicole and Gwen. Wow--didn't Gwen expect children to change things for a few years? The micro-preemie changes everything; and we see how Gwen's relationship with Nicole plays out. There is also some time spent exploring whether or not it's truly in Nicholas' best interests to keep him alive.

I could tell you much more but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that it's all very interesting.  The interviews with professionals including the NICU nurses; neonatologist Richard Krueger and Dr. Lily Chow add valuable information and an extra touch of compassion for this micro-preemie that he richly deserved.

The DVD comes with some really nice extras including an update.

Little Man will appeal to many parents who have suffered the almost unbearable stress of having to see their preemie child struggling to live despite the best efforts of the NICU staff. In addition, people who like documentaries about preemies with gay and lesbian/social and cultural themes will not be disappointed.",1357084800,6,2520,4.92
2799148,5,B000OQDSFY,"Little Man (Nicole Conn, 2005)

It has been almost seven months since I watched Little Man. I have been at a loss to review it ever since. And even as I sit here typing these first few sentences, I'm not entirely sure quite what I'm going to say about this exquisite, heart-wrenching documentary, which as I write these words (December 14, 2012) is sitting at #89 on my list of my hundred favorite movies. It is a movie that is tough to describe in words, because I'm not sure there are words that can convey the journey taken by Nicole, Gwen, and Nicholas. How do you collapse into a single term the combination of soul-destroying rage and a depth of love I can't even begin to imagine--and then sustaining that over 158 days (and really, that's just the beginning)?

I was already a Nicole Conn fan before seeing this. I got a chance to see her short Cynara: Poetry in Motion back in 2010. It sits at #316 on that same list I mentioned before, and in reviewing it, I said ""...it's possibly the most erotic, and the most romantic, forty minutes I have ever seen on a screen."" Nicole Conn, to intentionally misquote Clive Barker, most certainly knows the difference between a camera lens and a plate of spaghetti. In telling the story of Little Man, which was obviously a subject that struck very close to home, Conn made a decision from day one: this was not going to be objective in any way. This is memoir, not autobiography. I am fond of saying that I loathe memoirs. There are always a handful of exceptions to any rule, at least where I'm concerned. It was a very good decision; Conn approached the many and varied subjects of the film (herself, partner Gwen Baba, their two-year-old daughter Gabrielle, Nicholas' huge medical team, family friends, various reporters etc., and of course Nicholas himself) as characters as much as real people; this may be a documentary, but it still has a composed feel to it that makes me wonder just how many hours of actual footage Conn shot and edited down to the 112 minutes we see here. My guess is that number would be somewhere in the four figures (at least one member of the medical team says during an after-the-fact interview that after a while they just forgot the cameras were there).

[I'm not sure one can refer to ""spoiler alerts"" with a straight face when one is referring to a documentary, especially one whose director has gone out of her way to keep its fans updated about on the internet, but just in case, I'll tell you that portions of the rest of this review contain what could be considered spoilers, so you may want to stop reading now if you are sensitive to that sort of thing.]

I've gone two paragraphs before starting a plot synopsis, which is something I try never to do, so I'll pause the brain dump briefly to tell you exactly what it is I'm on about: Nicole Conn and her partner of seven years, Gwen Baba, had a pretty durned good life; Conn is an award-winning filmmaker, Baba a noted political activist. They had a two-year-old daughter, Gabrielle, and talked about having--and ultimately decided to have--another child. Thus began a string of negligence and duplicity that resulted in Nicholas, a micro-preemie born at twenty-five weeks with a chance of survival in the vicinity of one ten-thousandth of one percent. Despite her previous feelings towards preemies (in her director's statement at the movie's website, Conn says, ""It is difficult to believe that before my introduction to the NICU, I would change the channels as fast as I could if I saw a preemie on TV. I couldn't look at the pictures of them in magazines. I'm ashamed to admit it, but they terrified me.""), Conn finds herself not only head over heels in love with Nicholas, but also fascinated by the medical technology involved--the very fact that through technology it is now possible to extend life. But, as she asks later in the director's statement, ""We are becoming a society who saves lives because we can. But at what cost are [we] presuming to play god?""

The birth caused a rift in Conn and Baba's relationship almost immediately, as Conn logged endless hours at Nicholas' side, while Baba kept the home fires burning. The movie ends on what seems to be a happy note--Gwen comes to visit Nicholas in the hospital for the first time since his first few days of life--but it ended too early; Conn and Baba were divorced in 2007, soon after Nicholas' fifth birthday. (For the record, as I write this, Nicholas has beaten the odds and is on his way towards his eleventh birthday.)

Here's where we get into the territory where things get sticky. Nicholas is still alive, and thriving. End justifies the means, right? I don't know, and I rush to add that I am obviously playing armchair quarterback here, and deserve all the vitriol that could possibly come from playing armchair quarterback in this instance; I have two children (one of who was born seven months before I watched this movie, and I am fully aware that probably had something to do with my reactions to it), but both were born whole, hale, and hearty. I also know that it is entirely possible that were I in Nicole Conn's shoes I might very well have done the same thing, though I probably wouldn't have been able to afford it nearly as long as she did (that last quote I referred to in the director's statement goes on to address that specific piece of the puzzle--the outrageous cost of the procedures that were required to keep Nicholas alive during those first critical one hundred fifty-eight days). But you can't help but ask while watching this movie if Conn was making the right decisions. I couldn't, at least, and members of the medical team mention during their interviews that Conn was counseled on a number of occasions that the chances of Nicholas surviving were so slim that turning off life support was a viable option. I'm justifying the armchair quarterbacking because I believe, given the way Conn presents things in the film (specifically, the placement of some of the interviews) and because of some of the things she says in the director's statement on the movie's website, that Conn wants us to ask these questions. She wrestled with them as well, though I think the answers were pretty swift to come in her case--she was going to see this through to the end, no matter how bitter that end might be.

There is all sorts of meta here--all kinds of baggage I should be taking into account when considering my reaction to this movie. But I don't believe any of it matters, at least not enough to change my judgment, or my rating, of the movie; it really is that good. Few things I have ever seen compare with it. While I have on occasion referred to it above as a documentary, it would be more fitting to refer to it is a memoir. And taking it as that, instead of as a documentary, it's the best I've ever seen. This is, quite simply, great filmmaking. **** ",1356393600,5,6894,4.603742880390562

2799150,3,B000OQDSFY,"Sure, we all enjoy a story where love helps a person or family overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.  But that's just the problem with this film.  It only touches the surface of the actual issues surrounding the advancement of medical technology and the preservation of life at all costs.  Anyone with common sense knows that a baby born at 25 weeks is most likely going to face a lifetime of serious medical consequences.  We don't really need to be told that.  But I am not inspired by a story where the baby ends up with vision loss,  hearing loss, inability to digest food, a shattered nervous system, and probable Intellectual handicaps.  Yes, he's adorable.  But what will be his quality of life in 10, 20, 30 years down the road?

The mother's mantra to this child is ""Breathe and eat."". That's not life.  Sorry, but it's not.  And that's the problem when documentaries are more emotion than fact.",1313193600,10,906,4.707006369426751
2799151,5,B000OQDSFY,"I first saw part of this movie a couple years ago and I have been thinking about it ever since, wondering how it ended. It stuck in my mind and I finally had to buy it to find out. It was even more engaging than I remembered and really captures an amazing story. I found myself wondering how in the world they managed to record video of all these amazing and heart-wrenching scenes, but I am so glad they did. There are so many stories woven together in this documentary and together, it creates a movie that captured my heart and will stay with me for a long time.

2799152,5,B000OQDSFY,"The story of Nicholas, the smallest baby ever to survive in the NICU in which he is cared for, is told with extraordinary intimacy in the documentary film Little Man.

Nicholas' parents allow us into their world, which turns upside down when a surrogate mother pregnant with their baby experiences complications leading to Nicholas' extremely premature birth.  We watch as Nicole Conn--both mother and filmmaker--follows her primal instinct to do everything she can to ensure Nicholas survives, even when those around her, including the baby's doctors and her partner Gwen, think he can't or shouldn't survive because he is simply too small.  This story is told with searing and painful honesty by all involved, and makes every viewer examine his or her most deeply held beliefs about the value of life.

The filmmakers gained unparalleled access inside a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, and they captured both the everyday drama as well as the complex and nuanced ethical issues confronting doctors and parents alike as they cared for Nicholas.  Moments of exhilaration and joy, such as when Nicole first holds Nicholas, are contrasted with moments of fear and despair, as when Nicholas is rushed back to the hospital with a seizure disorder after having finally been discharged from the NICU.

Nicole Conn and her family, as well as the medical staff at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, have given us a huge and enduring gift by helping us to better understand the challenges confronting premature babies and their families, and by sharing the privilege to bear witness to the power of the human spirit.",1288396800,,1614,5.071698113207547
2799153,5,B000OQDSFY,"I just watched this Documentary/Film on Showtime today and WOW!!! I think anyone at all not just those in Nicole & Gwen's situation will take away from watching this film a new sense of what compassion,love,spirit,soul,strength and the will to live truly are. The film not only gave me a look into the families life but as well what all those involved (NICU Nurses,Doctors,Friends and Family) endure in situations like this, they all experience every realm of feelings that the family and themselves go through which in the world today with such non-compassion especially it seems in the Medical Field, was so refreshing to see that there are still Nurses and Doctors that truly do care about and have a connection with the patient and thier families.

 It also shows you that no matter your sexual preference that it all boils down to one thing we are all Human and go through the same happiness,struggles,fears,strength and love as any family whether Gay or Straight. I love this film and recommend it to everyone, I felt so connected that I didn't want it to end I want to know more, I hope that Nicole & Gwen continue to film so that we can follow Nicholas's life with them, so they always know that they are not alone and have even strangers that are out here that care for thier Family and wish them love and strength in each new day with Nicolas and Gabrielle.",1271289600,7,1367,4.621399176954733
2799154,5,B000OQDSFY,"I recorded the documentary off of Showtime mainly because Nicole Conn was the film maker. I thought it was an intense and moving film. I was surprised at the level of intimacy that was exposed by the filmaker of her family and herself. I do not have children but I do think if I faced a difficult situation in the period prior to birth, this film would supply a very stark view of what I could expect in the birth of a child born prematurely or with diabilities. A good film that passed extremely quickly considering it ran close to 2 hours.",1231977600,5,541,4.313725490196078

Perhaps when you asked yourself the question, or statement that you did not want him to suffer, he isn't and he didn't. All the hands that touched him from day one, I believe, are G-d given gifts and both of you were given this gift for a very good reason, and I saw it all through this video, you both went on a rollercoaster ride and came safely down.  Gwen (I think said it or vice-versa) she is the tortoise and I am the hare, think about that for a moment, you both needed this for yourselves, slow down the pace so the other can catch up, each other and your daughter.
