It had intelligence, wit, great characters, good plots - if sometimes they did stretch credibility -  and the incredible chemistry between Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg.

I had the Avengers series on VHS especially Diana Rigg (Emma Peel) years.  Unfortunately over time VHS don't play as well.  Although these series are not in HD they play pretty good on the big screen.  This was a decent price as these are now out of print.  They arrived in great condition and play excellent on my blu ray.  I am very impressed.  Dianna Rigg years are the best where she played Emma Peel.",1364947200,,554,4.352941176470588
4393,5,0767018699,"This set is a great way to be introduced to the Avengers. It contains some of the most outrageous episodes in the series. First up Never Say Die with Christopher Lee. This episode was very typical of the series and shows off how quirky it was. Epic is over the top and a little to much. But that was the intent by having it take place on a movie studio set, a first for a tv series I believe. The Superlative Seven is a quick fun episode done like Then There Were None type story. Donald Sutherland and Charlotte Rampling show up in this episode and due very well.

4474,5,0767018699,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:

1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).

2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.

3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 2"" color-coded ORANGE), is the second of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.

Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.

Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.

In the 1968 Set No. 2 (which includes Vols. 3 and 4), we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

Volume 3:

""All Done With Mirrors"" - Steed is under house arrest (a theme we've seen before!) while Tara plugs the leaks at a classified facility that hasn't been keeping its secrets.

""Legacy of Death"" - The inheritance of a dagger turns into a truly double-edged gift and bodies pile up in Steed's drawing room.

""Noon Doomsday"" - Steed is trapped in a convalescent home by an old adversary who has a flair for drama and a thirst for vengeance.

Volume 4:

""Look (Stop Me If You've Heard this One)... But There Were These Two Fellers"" - John Cleese guest stars as Steed and Tara face down a band of killer clowns determined to save their rest home from destruction.

""Have Guns... Will Haggle"" - Tara's on the hot seat when Black Market rifle brokers choose her for a product demonstration!

""They Keep Killing Steed"" - A plot to infiltrate and subvert a peace conference hinges on the creation of an exact double of Steed (yet another familiar theme!)

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, while not exactly as marvelous as the 1967 episodes, this particular set still garners my highest recommendation!",1222128000,4,4914,4.920193470374849
4475,3,0767018699,"A lot of reviews of this set were great, especially the episode that related to picture (Queen of Sin). I've been an Avengers fan since its original airings, & I've always found Miss Peel right attractive, but Queen of Sin is the worst episode I've looked at on DVD so far. Her outfit is not really that sexy, & the story to that episode was absolutely lousy (& loud). If you're buying individual sets & not the whole Emma Peel megaset, then skip this set; don't let the cover fool you. The rest of the episodes in this set are better however, so if you're making complete year purchases, then buy this set too....you decide.",1220140800,3,625,4.443478260869565

This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

1967 was Diana Rigg's last full season as Steed's partner. Her career really launched in 1965 from this fine series in her role as Mrs. Emma Peel, the sexy and lively partner to the refined secret agent Englishman, John Steed, who was shrewdly played by Patrick Macnee. In fact, in the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until many years later.

Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here.

Each 52-minute episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in these episodes, every nemesis ranging from an airborne costume party to a man (actually, an androidish double of a man), who cannot be killed by traditional means.

Here, we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

""The Living Dead"" -- A group of men are lost in a disastrous mine collapse, including the local squire. Afterward, a local hermit spots ""the ghost"" of this man, the ""dead"" Duke of Benedict, (as opposed to his wimpy succeeder), near a spooky cemetery chapel. Steed and Mrs. Peel investigate and they discover an ""underground city"" where an army of pseudo-evil-German-types is being built up to take over Great Britain! A superior episode.

""The Hidden Tiger"" - A butler is ripped to shreds in an English manor house. Nearby is an agricultural research station which falls under the suspicion of Steed and Mrs. Peel. After more maulings (deaths), it becomes clear that a devious Sussex organization, P.U.R.R.R., (!!!) is linked to the killings - all the victims seem to be on the organization's board of directors.

""The Correct Way to Kill"" - Russian espionage agents are being killed off in England... but not by the English agents. Steed and Mrs. Peel pair off with their Russian counterparts to catch the murderer. This episode is a lot of fun.

""Never, Never Say Die"" - A man is accidentally run down by a car and killed... but then he ""escapes"" off the exam table when the doc isn't watching! Steed and Mrs. Peel really get suspicious when he is killed a second time, by the same means, and later shows up causing a LOT of trouble. This macho guy also seems much affected by radio waves which leads The Avengers to discover that the man is an android and that more such android ""doubles"" of important people are infesting the local community. The bonus of this episode is that it stars the great Christopher Lee!

""Epic"" -- Mrs. Peel is kidnapped and taken to Schneer Studios where she is forced to make a movie about her own murder; however, the killers are mostly incompetent. This is a funny one.

""The Superlative Seven"" - Steed attends a high-end costume party that is conducted in an aircraft bound for... ??????  It's quickly discovered that all the invited guests are athletes of sorts and that they will be utilized to test a new and improved superman. Mrs. Peel flies to the dangerous and isolated island stronghold to attempt Steed's rescue. A very fun romp of an episode.

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity... in fact, it actually went ""sci-fi"" in some episodes. This did not diminish my love for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention it only to prepare viewers for these changes and actualities.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Rigg's provocative, '60s mod body suits much accentuate her sensual magnetism with the notable change from black-and-white to color.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1967 ""sets,"" (as I mentioned earlier, there are four in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), over the next few days so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon.

4478,5,0767018699,"James Bond, move over! This is a set of SEVEN, 52-minute entries from the great and brilliant team of Patrick Macnee (as the aristocratic John Steed) and Diana Rigg (as the tantalizing Emma Peel). The Rigg years were definitely the best ones and there is one other set from 1966 (also with Rigg, it offers SIX episodes) so don't confuse them! All these episodes were shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. Here's a rundown of the episodes:

""The Danger Makers"" --  The '60s version of the TV show ""Jackass""! Steed and Peel have to ascertain why these important British officials continue to challenge suicide -- and some succeed! Written by Roger Marshall.

""A Touch of Brimstone"" -- This one was banned from American television because Emma Peel dons high-laced boots, a spiked dog collar and a very skimpy outfit! Here, we have The Hellfire Club, hoaxsters, and murder! Written by Brian Clemens.

""A Sense of History"" -- It's a battle over economic theory, by medieval Robin Hood types. But these denizens of the woods (and a college campus) don't mind killing those who disagree with their views. This is a superb episode. Written by Martin Woodhouse.

""How to Succeed... at Murder"" -- Business executives are being knocked off... by their feminist secretaries?!? The trail leads Steed and Mrs. Peel to an elite perfumery but the ring leader is quite elusive. Written by Brian Clemens.

""Honey for the Prince"" -- A Middle-eastern prince on a diplomatic mission is the target for assassination. Steed and Mrs. Peel intervene. Diana Rigg was never HOTTER than she was in this special ""Bonus Episode"". Written by Brian Clemens.

""What the Butler Saw"" -- The secret defense plans are stolen! Steed must take on the disguise of a student butler to resolve the mystery. Written by Brian Clemens.

""The House That Jack Built"" -- Here, we have a psychological thriller. Mrs. Peel inherits an estate from her ""Uncle Jack,"" and is subsequently  trapped inside a carnivalistic madhouse. Steed rushes to the rescue. This is a great one. Written by Brian Clemens.

I don't know if you get the same deal if you purchase the DVD set -- with the VHS set, you'll get 3 tapes, with two episodes per tape (except on one tape where there's the ""bonus episode,"" which makes three episodes on that one), for a total of 7 episodes. The tapes are not copy-protected.

There were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they weren't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish. Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply weren't as dynamic as Rigg. Also, the music, action, and story-writing much improved in '65, which is when ""The Avengers"" got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time. These black-and-white Macnee-Rigg entries continued through 1966, (it went color after that and Rigg eventually left the series). In the end, '65 and '66 were the two best years of all.",1206489600,,2968,4.857425742574257

The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of the series. Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. Never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63-'64) I can see that they dragged quite a bit and were much more soap opera-ish.

Each episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". In this set, you'll encounter everything from giant man-eating plants to artificial rain that drowns nosey people.

Here, we have SEVEN great episodes (one more than Set One): ""The Hour That Never Was"" (written by Roger Marshall); ""Dial A Deadly Number"" (written by Roger Marshall); ""The Murder Market"" (written by Tony Williamson); ""A Surfeit of H2O"" (written by Colin Finbow); ""Man-Eater of Surrey Green"" (written by Phillip Levene); ""Two's A Crowd"" (written by Phillip Levene), and; [bonus episode] ""Too Many Christmas Trees"" (written by Tony Williamson).

It's difficult to evaluate which is the ""best"" episode in this set -- they're all quite excellent. I WILL say that this set of episodes is just marginally better than the first set. The '65 series makes for great all-day TV watching on a rainy Saturday -- in fact, I watch them over and over. The entire series is sort of crazy like ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" but with the great British ambiance of ""Doctor Who"". If you've never seen ""The Avengers"" before, you're in for a real treat!",1200700800,2,2645,5.111111111111111
4480,4,0767018699,"I bought this DVD because of the extremely silly episode with the long title. I remembered watching it in 1968, and being amazed at all the talent on show, and always had it as a favourite. It wears as well as you expect, which means I love the stagey sets, outrageous clothes (yes, we wore stuff like that), the cars. I'm a hard-core Emma Peel fan, but Tara, while not being quite so forceful nor as sexy, has her own appeal. The other episodes are like new to me - maybe I didn't see them back then, but I was such a regular every Saturday evening ... memory fades.",1184544000,6,567,4.2110091743119265

The series has aged very well and Mrs. Peel still captivates.  In my opinion, (without splurging on the Megaset), this is the best compromise set for ""Emma-watching"", and has most of the episodes you will want or that you need as a fan of the divine Ms. Rigg.

4495,5,0767018699,"Each of Steed's ladies made their own mark.  Honor Blackman's Kathy Gale, set the pace.  Sleek sassy women, who were as smart as they were sexy.  They held their own in a man's world and didn't need someone to take care of them.  Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims, wives or secretaries on telly at the time.  Blackman made less of an impact in US, because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement, to keep people from seeing reruns.  Since they were run on ABC, tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.

Rigg came along and made Emma Peel a character that will go down in the hall of fame.  She is as popular today, if not more so.  So when she left--to do as Blackman did -- go on to be a Bond girl, Steed had to have another partner.  Enter Tara King.  She gorgeous full figure Canadian with eyes to do for.  They tried to play on her more feminine side (and with horrid fashions).  Seriously, the clothes designers for Tara needs shooting.  For the most part, they couldn't design more dumpy look clothes.  They stuffed her in a series of wigs - some very bad - so point one, she was fighting an uphill battle.  Also, the scripts were not as sharp.  Even so Tara is charming and a pleasure to watch.

2)  ""The Hidden Tiger"" - ""Steed hunts a big cat - and Emma gets badly scratched"".  In this episode, Steed and Emma are looking to people being killed and all signs show they are being killed by a tiger stalking the British country side.  Look for Gabrielle Drake in this episode (the head purple wigged Moon base gal from UFO!).

3) ""The Correct Way to Kill""  ""Steed changes partners - and Emma joins the Enemy"" has more than one Steed dashing about, as John and Emma try to end a ring selling British top secrets.

4) ""Never, Never Say Die""  ""Steed meets a dead man - Emma fights the corpse""  A man determined to steal the patent on eternal life has Emma and Steed running in circles and seeing the dead.

5) ""EPIC"" - ""Steed catches a falling star - and Emma makes a movie"" has Emma unwittingly starring in a movie called ""The Destruction of Emma Peel"".  A premise John feels is not up to ""snuff"".

6) ""The Superlative Seven"" - ""Steed flies to nowhere and Emma does her party piece"" A really fun episode has the great Donald Sutherland as a mysterious host, ala Ten Little Indian.  All the guests are the best at what they do, invited by someone unknown to them.  Lured aboard a plane and set down on a tiny island, they must fight to save their lives.

4497,5,0767018699,"Seconds series 1966, still B & W has some really great episodes with Steed and Mrs. Peel.  The gelling of Rigg's and Macnee's characters were well onto making

screen history, and with cause.  Both of these fine actors brought these characters alive.  Seven episodes this time.

1) ""The Danger Makers"" sees a high-ranking ex-serviceman seeking to feed their high threshold for adventure.  The banter between Steel and Mrs. Peel sharpens to double entendres that trademarks their pairing.

2) ""A Touch of Brimstone"" lets Mrs. Peel take down her hair, or rather put it up, as Emma and John investigate a group resurrecting the infamous Hellfire Club.  Mrs. Peel shows she looks just as stunning in corset, high-lace boots and spiked dog-collar, which she wears as the ""Queen of Sin"".  The look was designed by Rigg, and ridiculously, because of her costume, the episode was banned from airing in the US!

3) ""What the Butler Saw"" has our pair of Britain's best out in search for missing defense plans.

4) ""The House that Jack Built"" has Emma receiving news her uncle has died and left her his country estate.  When she gets to the manor, she soon finds herself drugged and trapped inside a house that is far from your normal house, as designed to end Emma's life.

5) ""A Sense of History"" Have Emma donning a merry man's costume in this Robin Hood adventure.  A modern day Robin is found with an arrow in the back, pushing Steed and Emma to stop the neo-fascist Merry Men from achieving their devilish plans.

6) ""How to Succeed at Murder"" puts Emma and John on the trail of executives being executed, in a posh perfumerie where a woman ""nose"" best.

7) ""Honey for the Prince"" when a resort where you live out your fantasies turns deadly, our pair are sent to stop the evil doings.  Emma goes harem girl! to save the day and up the ratings!

4498,5,0767018699,"The Second set of 1965 era has Steed and Peel gelling as partners.  Rigg and Macnee have the perfect sizzle of chemistry.  Admiration in their eyes, the flash and fire, but all kept quite under control as they function together to stop the evil menace against Britain.  I have seen some say this series came about because of the success of the Bond Film, but it was already on the air with the
early episodes, and follow in the trek of Patrick MacGoohan's ""Danger Man"", which turned into ""Secret Agent"" (and then into ""the Prisoner"").  These seven episodes are still in B&W, which I think even added to this mysterious ambiance of the episodes.  Being able to film in lower light, permits those deep shadows, giving a sinister touch.

1) ""The Murder Market"" takes Steed and Emma undercover at a marriage bureau, ending with Steed rescuing Emma from being buried alive as she gets too close to the ""black widows"" at the center of this evil plot
2) ""A Surfeit of H20"" A freak rainstorm drowns locals in the fields.  Fearing this is the return of the ""Great Flood"", they villagers have begun building a new Ark.  Emma is stylish even in a Mac!
3) ""The Hour That Never Was"" Steed visits his old RAF airbase in Hamlin.
Hours are missing in people's memories, so Steed and Emma must uncover brainwashing saboteurs, threatening England.
4) ""Dial a Deadly Number"" have Steed and Emma investigating a device called a ""Bleeper"".  The Bleeper is designed to help millionaires keep in touch, but an evil doer has set it to reach out and kill.
5) ""Man-Eater of Surrey Green""  When a outer space artichoke, lands and takes root, and begins killing eminent horticulturists, Emma and Steed get out the Roundup.  Rocky and Bullwinkle fought a similar plant in the cartoons - wonder who was first...lol?
6) ""Two's A Crowd"" Russian agents had let loose a doppelganger for Steed, in order to infiltrate a defense conference
7) ""Too Many Christmas Trees"" is one of my fav episodes.  Steed has been having a strange nightmare, so he welcomes the invitation for Hols in the country at friends.  He invites Emma to tag along.  They dress up in period costumes, and all seem to have a good time, but Emma begins to suspect Steed's dream is not a dream, but someone trying to control Steed's mine through telepathy

A great collection of episodes, like the well written (and provocative) ""A Touch of Brimstone"" to the dead funny ""What the Butler Saw"" and the toying-with-your-mind ""The House that Jack Built"". This set provides a excellent, varied taste of the show. I recommend it to everyone, but if you really love the show, I say just buy the Emma Peel Megaset on DVD!

4500,5,0767018699,"I am still kind of angry that A&E releases TV shows in episode groups instead of season sets, making all the sets way too expensive, even knowing they are all bare bones with no extras at all! (They recently got it right with the upcoming THE NEW AVENGERS: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON)
 Well, this set is one of the best. Diana Rigg is not my favorite Avenger girl (Joanna Lumney as Purdey in THE NEW AVENGERS is) but she shows here why she became the most popular all around the world (Except for France, they like Tara King) and probally Steed's favorite.
 THE MURDER MARKET- An excellent dark but funny episode. The Hitchcockian direction is superb like the fantastic aquarium murder during the intro. Funny moments include Steed imitating a fish and Emma dancing around her coffin. However, there are a few cons: This was Diana's first episode, and the writers were trying to make her a Cathy Gale-type of character who argues with Steed. Don't get me wrong, I love the Cathy Gale episodes as well, but this isn't Emma! It's Cathy! The other con is the embarassing use of a male stunt to replace Diana Rigg during a fall.  (4/5)
 A SURFEIT OF H20- This episode's plot was taken to do the mediocre movie in 1998.  It deals with A DIABOLICAL MASTERMIND who creates a weather-making machine! Quite overrated. The villain is too nice and his diabolocal plan is rather weak. There is also the annoying Noah-like character that screams through the entire episode. There are still some good moments, like the slippery fight at the end. Let's not forget the way victims die: It makes no sense! (3.5/5)
 THE HOUR THAT NEVER WAS- This starts off as a Twilight Zone episode, with Steed and Emma inside a deserted airbase trying to figure out what is going on! It is soon explained, only at the end. This is a very fun episode. The first half, with nothing but dialogue between Rigg and McNee is very amusing. (4.5/5)
 DIAL A DEADLY NUMBER- Before the pager was invented, there was the bleeper! Businessmen are dying from heart-attacks and Steed tries to crack the case. They all were carrying a pager-like device inside their pockets. What could it be? If you love the Cathy Gale episodes like me, you are going to love this one. Very dark episode with excellent funny moments like the wine-tasting contest. Only con: The plot is quite confusing after a while. (4.5/5)
 THE MEN-EATER AT SURREY GREEN- This episode puzzles me. It is a very funny take at the many Sci-Fi and B-Horror flicks from the 50's. There are many hilarious moments here (Was that ""moon vegetation"" line intentional?) and the old lady always cracks me up. But there are some moments that are way too dark and sad for such an apisode such as the electrocution. Let's not forget the Laura sub-plot that is dropped out half-way through. If you excuse the horrible stuntwork during the climatic fight, (The stuntman from THE MURDER MARKET is back again!) you will have a fun time. But it is still a silly ""bad"" episode. (3/5)
 TWO'S A CROWD- This is a quite good episode. The doopledanger issue is done quite well here. The actio sequence at the end featuring model bombers is excellent. (4/5)
 BONUS: TOO MANY CHRISTMAS TREES- Simple: This is one of the best AVENGERS ever! You have a fair X-Files plot, good villains, excellent creepy Christmas atmosphere, some horror movie elements, silly dream sequences, hilarious dialogue, and the great relationship between Steed and Emma. The tag scene is not to be missed! (Did they kiss?) One thing however: What happened to the psychic villainess? Well, enjoy the show! (5/5)",1054944000,7,3574,4.7223113964687

4512,5,0767018699,"The concluding black-and-white episodes of the Diana Rigg series had a more than usual tendency to show off her figure to fullest advantage.  Such is the case especially with ""A Sense of History,"" in which she dresses in a leg-revealing Robin Hood outfit, and ""A Touch of Brimstone,"" where she wears next to nothing as the Queen of Sin (and is attacked with a whip, to boot).  ""How To Succeed...At Murder"" has her in a bodystocking/leotard, practicing ballet for a good portion of the story.  And when she isn't dressing down, she's quite the clothes-horse, wearing a gorgeous white pants suit, for instance, in ""The House That Jack Built,"" a memorably striking bit of surrealistic sci-fi.
Oh, yes  -  Patrick Macnee is here too, lest we forget that he was the only actor to have starred in every season of the show.  And he gets to play dress-up in these episodes, as much as Diana Rigg dresses down.
As usual, the interplay between the two is delightfully witty and sparkling, their interaction with numerous flamboyantly unusual villains (and more common thugs) well-choreographed and exciting.",1020988800,2,1097,4.934782608695652
4513,5,0767018699,"""Castle De'ath"" is an unusual Avengers entry, in that Steed and Emma are both undercover at the same place at the same time, from the very start of the episode.  The cinematography is curiously rather bleached, for what probably should have been a starker melodrama  -  but it works splendidly, anyway.  This one consists mostly of skulking and good fights, Emma's skulking done in a fetching peignoir by moonlight.  The flirtation between Emma and Steed is especially light and playful.  The plot, about a secret submarine base and its connection to the disruption of the local economy, is clever and credibly handled.
""The Master Minds"" is one of my personal favorites, about a MENSA-esque high-I.Q. club called RANSACK, which utilizes the best minds in Britain  -  without their knowledge  -  to infiltrate and sabotage military bases, and steal state secrets for sale to the highest bidder.  It's quite similar to Ian Fleming's contemporaneous James Bond novel, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""  -  which, amusingly enough, starred Diana Rigg in the film version.  Like ""Castle De'ath,"" Steed and Emma work undercover at the same location, but with a far different result:  Emma becomes brainwashed into RANSACK's nocturnal espionage society, and Steed has to snap her out of it  -  before she kills him.  The concluding fight is terrific, Emma's final punch-line one of the more humorous in the series by means of its unique delivery.
A very good pair of early Avengers episodes.",1020124800,,1485,5.066115702479339
4514,5,0767018699,"For my money, this set represents The Avengers at its peak. They did terrific shows before and after these last seven episodes of '66, but they never had another such sustained streak of brilliance as this here.
The set includes ""The House That Jack Built,"" my favorite episode of the Diana Rigg series. I love it because it's such a great showcase for Diana as an actress, but also that we can see a strong, intelligent female character saving her own skin (rather than being rescued by a dashing hero) by *reasoning* her way out of the problem. I also think the house itself is just an ingenious idea: what would you do if you were stuck in a house designed as a machine to trap you inside? Apparently the producers were so intrigued by the idea, they gave Mrs. Peel a similar problem in the '67 episode, ""The Joker.""
I also see the influence of the episode pop up in other series from time to time. Some writers have noted the debt that the X-Files owes to the Avengers. Look for the X-Files episode called ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"" (w/ Ed Asner & Lily Tomlin) playing on FX during the holidays, and see if you don't think it's Chris Carter's homage to ""The House That Jack Built.""
Anyway, every episode in this set is just as inspired and witty in its own way, most of them variations on secret societies and assassination conspiracies. We also get some of Diana Rigg's most notorious costumes here: the Queen of Sin in ""A Touch of Brimstone,"" a harem girl in ""Honey for the Prince,"" and Robin Hood in ""A Sense of History.""
My only complaint: where is the chessboard introduction to the episodes? I realize that the intro was created only for the American audience, but for Americans who saw the program on TV it's become part of the show! Every US fan who knows the show from TV can recite the narration from memory: ""Extraordinary crimes against the people and the state have to be avenged by agents extraordinary... two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur... otherwise known as... THE AVENGERS!""
Come on, you hear the burst of bongos, you see the guy fall onto the chessboard with a knife in his back, there's the narration, Emma steps forward in her catsuit, Steed breaks out the champagne... and you're primed to go. How could they take that out? It's classic! So classic, the definitive book on The Avengers, THE COMPLETE AVENGERS by Dave Rogers, has a cover photo of Steed & Mrs. Peel standing on the set. I just don't understand what A&E was thinking.
If you're new to the show, you won't miss what you never knew, and nobody should let that omission deter them from getting the set, anyway. It's just a small frustration for me because I like the intro so much. Apart from that, five stars for the set. The stories are as clever as the series ever got, Rigg has really found herself in the role by now and the chemistry between her and Patrick MacNee is electric, and the b&w film looks incredible after the restoration.

The dialog is usually good especially when Emma is involved.  The episode The House that Jack Built is superb.  It's actually chilling because Emma's predicament(and it is Diana Rigg's episode) is truly bizarre and frightening.
