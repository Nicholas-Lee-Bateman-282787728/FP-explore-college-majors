8129193,5,B000G73US6,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1355356800,,786,4.581560283687943

8129197,4,B000G73US6,"ok, so strait up, i am a fan of (most of) the gundam franchise.

i enjoy the telling and re-telling of what, in the original release gundam series was obviously a derivation of the story of World War II. for the most part it remains the same as it always has been in terms of the story itself.

With gundam SEED however, new wrinkles such as excellent character developement and the enriched quality of story-telling which is for the most part only surpassed by the quality of the art (the entire series being considered to be this art) as a whole can bee seen.

The story of Gundam SEED: Destiny is as much about Shin Asuka as it is about Athrun Zala and toward the end of the series is much more about  establishing a greater understanding of the strength of Athrun's relationship with Kira Yamato (the protagonist of Gundam SEED) even in their divergent paths in their own lives, and about what it means to fight, and to have something for which to fight than it is specifically about Shin.

I enjoyed Seed Destiny both because SEED (the core show) is my favorite rendition of the Gundam story to date (out of a reminiscence for that which i care greatly) and because the story itself is much darker. it is to Gundam SEED what Stardust Memory is to the original Gundam series, more/less.

all of ""our heroes"" both in ZAFT and OMNI (the earth federation's space-bourne military from whom Kira fights in SEED) have grown up, and the world has with them.

anyway, its all very refreshing, and all of the characters fit their rolls very well and for the most part are likable. i must confess, i have not seen (nor do i care to) the english dub, as it was HORRID(!) in the english release of Gundam SEED (almost all of the anime i watch is either fan-subbed, or i speak enough japanese to follow it without subs when they aren't available. generally i frown on dubbing unless great care is taken, however, if the only way you are going to experience this great series is dubbed, so be it.",1161043200,3,1986,4.454545454545454

In Episode 17, Meer Campbell can be seen and heard singing ""Quiet Night C.E. 73"" for the first time on the series. It is Meer's uptempo version of the Lacus Clyne song ""Shizukana Yoru ni"" (""In the Quiet Night""). In case Bandai Entertainment and The Ocean Group do not include translations of the original Japanese ending credits for some songs - which they did not do for the Lacus Clyne songs on the Mobile Suit Gundam Seed series, excluding the movies - here are the English translations for the Meer Campbell songs: Insert Song ""Quiet Night C.E. 73,"" Lyrics by Yuki Kajiura, Composed by Toshihiko Sahashi, Arranged by Hideyuki Daichi Suzuki, Performed by Meer Campbell (Rie Tanaka) (Victor Entertainment); Insert Song ""EMOTION,"" Lyrics by Shouko Shimizu, Composed / Arranged by Hideyuki Daichi Suzuki, Performed by Meer Campbell (Rie Tanaka) (Victor Entertainment). ""EMOTION"" is heard on episode 47. Full versions of both Meer Campbell songs, ""Quiet Night C.E. 73"" and ""EMOTION,"" as sung by Meer's Japanese voice actor Rie Tanaka, can be found on the Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Suit CD Vol. 8 Lacus Clyne x Meer Campbell.
