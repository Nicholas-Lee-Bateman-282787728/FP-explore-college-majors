But the movie is good I saw it because I purchased it from LA.  Shipper was nice however to return I would have to ship it back  for 10 dollars and rec only 7 dollars back,. I'll keep it.",1521504000,,340,3.6027397260273974
8071913,1,B000A16HZQ,I should have read the reviews before buying this.  None of the movies worked in any of the dvd players.  I believe they must be the not available to be played in the US format.  This was to be a gift so it wasn't opened right away or I would have tried to return for my money.  I will know better next time I guess,1511740800,,315,3.8
