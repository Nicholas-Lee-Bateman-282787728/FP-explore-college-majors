6358594,5,B00JHH1VDC,Now of other studios would release complete series shows like Shout does then maybe sales would improve on classic series. I have season one already but I don't mind double dipping to get the complete series. This show is fun and brings back memories as a child when TV was worth watching unlike so many reality shows today,1401408000,27,323,4.586206896551724
6358595,4,B00JHH1VDC,"My beef with Shout is not the price at this point but their occasional Shout Exclusives which is fine but they don't ship outside US which is me. Then the later release of Marx Bros material has a BONUS disc which is only in the sets bought direct from them which cuts me out again. As what I believe is a taped show, it maybe not be that great a quality for Blu ray but I would have liked to go that way with these shows and I have a few older series now as of this month in Blu Ray format like I Love Lucy, Little House, Jackie Gleason & Andy Griffith. I used to watch Kotter in US during my visits to family in Detroit in the 1970s. The other show was Room 222.",1401321600,4,664,3.889705882352941
6358596,5,B00JHH1VDC,"Yes, I also purchased season one, and will now have a duplicate, but that's preferable to waiting years for the remaining seasons to be released individually. I have always felt that with any TV series, the entire series should be released up front rather than as individual seasons. Doing so after one or more seasons have already been released  takes advantage of the customer. By the way, fans of the series are not all in agreement as to which seasons are the best. I prefer seasons 3 through 5.",1401235200,10,499,4.606741573033708
6358597,1,B00JHH1VDC,I'm fan of  at least the first 2 seasons if not the entire series. But I agree with the above reviewer and the rest of the naysayers. Shout factory is charging too much. It shouldn't be any more than $50.,1401148800,18,204,4.1
6358598,1,B00JHH1VDC,"I have Season One and love this old show.  I have waitied for years for Season 2 to finally be released.  Imagine the shock of seeing that the only way to get Season 2 is to buy the complete set (so I will then have 2 copies of Season 1) .. not to mention the shock of seeing the price.  This show was worthless after Season 2, so I will now have to buy crappy seasons I don't want just to get a copy of Season 2?  I will not be buying this for any price.  Let's boycott Shout Factory so they will see that they can't treat their customers this way.",1401148800,10,549,3.8660714285714284
6358599,5,B00JHH1VDC,"I was too young to watch the first season but watched it in reruns during the early 1980s and it brings back fun memories. It will be fun to see the late Robert Hegyes,Ron Palillo and Hotsy Totsy Debralee Scott.
Thank you Shout Factory.",1400457600,20,236,4.386363636363637
6358600,1,B00JHH1VDC,"Loved the show when it was on the air. Would consider purchasing it if it were not for the greed of Shout Factory and charging an outrageous price for only a 3 season show. Some say it was 4-5 seasons, but by the time season 4-5 came around, most of the the original cast had left and the show never had a chance to survive afterwards. Good thing Gable Craplan turned to playing poker or he would have become a street bum. For $116.99, please protest this outrageous price by not buying this series! This will teach Shout Factory to stop being so darn greedy!",1400198400,21,559,4.333333333333333

I remember it being the show to watch. Well, it and SNL. Between the two there were enough catch phrases to make up most of the conversation for the next three years of school.

Watching these episodes again for the first time brought back lots of memories - I'm surprised at how much I remember individual episodes. I'm also surprised at recognizing some of the guest stars - like James Wood in the second episode first season.

When there is nothing else on at night, especially boring reality shows, we slip in a disc and spend the evening laughing our heads off.  The beauty of this comedy is that it was made in front of live audience and there is no canned laughter like today's ""canned"" supposedly comedy shows that mostly are not funny.
A great product that I would recommend.",1423699200,5,429,4.35
6358661,5,B00JHH1VDC,"I am glad to see the, Welcome Back, Kotter, series go public.
Many of the 1970's to early 1980's series have had trouble, with
music releases, and other sign offs.
China Beach, Newhart, Happy Days, WKRP, are a few that come
to mind.
And all but Happy Days have resolved their issues, and they have
gotten most of their music releases.
It is sad that  members of the original Kotter cast, are no longer with
us, RIP Robert Heyges and Ron Palillo.
The Kotter series ended after 95 episodes, and many think it may have
run a few seasons too long, as most of the cast had moved on, by episode
95.
Kotter is a view of what life was like back in the 70's, and you get a glimpse
of high school life and issues from that era, that is long gone.
The video's have good picture quality, which is outstanding considering that
back in the 70's, everything was on VHS, and we all know those tapes do not
last forever.
I will not get into the price debate.
But just say, you get what you pay for.",1423612800,,981,4.190476190476191

Gabe Kaplan's jokes are sprinkled liberally throughout the series with at least one, if not two of them being told in each show. The series sometimes carries some great lessons on growing up and treating others with respect, even when those participating are sweat hogs. Performance kudos all the way around and I've come to appreciate the humor in the series as much as my wife does. Thankfully, it is now fully released to DVD. Picture and sound are adequate (clean) given the source material and the live audience.

6358702,5,B00JHH1VDC,"Welcome Back Kotter is a time capsule of the mid 70's.  It's a fairly sanitized version of reality, but it is a fun, and funny, show all the same.  The cast was perfect for their roles, and the writing really hit home and gives the viewer a good idea of what the 70's were like.  WBK is almost like a 1950's style take on the 1970's.  It's edgier than a show would have been in the 50's, but definitely a toned down version of what the reality was in the mid 70's.

Great cast, fairly good writing, and a lot of fun.  It's an entertaining show.

And the price is right.  Break down the cost per season and you're right in line with what the first season cost when it came out a few years back.  The full series set is well worth buying if you're curious about the show, or if you grew up watching Mr. Kotter and the Sweathogs.",1404518400,11,826,4.080745341614906

8650959,4,B00JHH1VDC,"The only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is the item was purchased as new, but the DVDs have some blemishes.  It came packaged like it was new, but so far nearly every DVD has some scratch marks and fingerprint smudges.  We've only gotten through the first season and part of season two and they've all played OK, but to me they don't look new.",1514592000,2,354,4.115942028985507

8650961,5,B00JHH1VDC,"Other than making John Travolta a teen heartthrob, this series commented on social change. It was still a 'radical' idea to provide free appropriate public education to all students: off screen federal laws for special education had just been recently passed.. The troublemaker-remedial connection is hammed up a little too much at times, the wardrobe and technology are obviously VERY dated, but other episodes easily could have ACTUALLY been my own high school experience in the 1990's.

For starters guidance counselors did not think very highly of us (Dr Epstein I presume) just because we were in remedial classes. Receiving appropriate academic services gives the sweathogs critical thinking skills to help stop a suicide attempt ( Once Upon a Ledge), and help deliver a baby (Barbarino's Baby). They want to make something useful of themselves!

Well  meaning individuals idealistically arrived with the best of intentions. But unlike the street smart Kotter (and our real-life counterparts) who weren't afraid of a schoolhouse challenge, these student teachers were only entering  because a college professor had told them it would be 'nice' to work with us (Hello Ms Chips) They were mentally and/or emotionally underprepared for what laid ahead. .

 And there were rivalries between students who were remedial (Follow the Leader, Arrividerci  Arnold) and those who were not. Having to straddle the two worlds required a lot of hard work and skill. Becoming so tight knit, the exit or entrance (Beau's Jest) of a student ultimately disrupted the class. Having been picked on by other students and even administrators such as Mr. Woodman (played deliciously by John Sylvester White) who refused to consider  them 'real' students, the Sweathogs instinctively protected each other like a family. They understood that they had to band together just in order to survive. In the new world, they were unsure of what was going to happen to each other.

A really solemn episode is ""The Telethon"" ---because the sweathogs must hold a telethon to fully fund their education supplies. The school is only required to educate them, it does not have adequate money to provide supplies for the education. Other than the fashions/technologies interesting to remember there are some campuses still resorting to this today.

Since the schools did not at all have to do any transition planning in this era and there also was no ADA which covered private business without federal funding ""The Return of Hotsy Totsy"" makes perfect sense.  in the pre-internet era, she needs to known to write away to agencies and organizations--including knowing who specifically contact. Yes they are guys but they still don't want her working there. Without a high school degree completed, she has very few other options. It happens after ""Angie"" where we had first learned that girls officially could not be sweathogs. They're in the remedial class too, but this series is very much told from the guys point of view.

This series is still good viewing for anybody. But it should be required for people even considering a career in special education. It should also be in the collection of people interested in disability media/disability studies.",1500163200,,3219,5.18111753371869
