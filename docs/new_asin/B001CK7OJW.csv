I like it and highly recommend it for any slayers fan",1285977600,,319,4.063492063492063
8288152,5,B001CK7OJW,"Slayers is the one of the better anime series out there. From the 1st Season to 5th Season its a great anime. Lots of Magic and Sword fighting in this anime with lots of running gags from calling Lina Ms Flat Chest to Prince Phil being called a troll. Its a Must for any anime fan out there. There is 5 seasons and OVA/OAV Movie boxset to. I have been watching The Slayers Series from day one and I have really enjoyed the series

OVA/Movie Boxest takes place before the start of the 1st slayers tv series. Lina and Naga going around the country side causing trouble helping people out for money or personal gain with lots of laughs chills and spills. Great Series Must Have Set for the anime fan",1278806400,,696,4.312977099236641
8288153,3,B001CK7OJW,"This is nothing compared to the show.  The show is funny, this isn't.  The show has good voicing...this doesn't.  But, it's convenient to have all the movies and OVA's together, even though they are not even close to as good as the show.  Only get it if you're a huge slayers fan, and want to see everything they ever made from it.",1266624000,,331,4.290322580645161
8288154,5,B001CK7OJW,"My wife and I are avid Slayers fans.  We have all three series on DVD and can't wait for the new fourth season to become available.

We have been wanting the movies and OVAs for some time, but simply haven't invested in them.  When I saw this become available, it was a no brainer.  There is no better way to get all 5 movies and both OVAs.

You get three slim DVD cases in a nice box.  DVD #1 has the first two movies, DVD #2 has the remaining three movies, and DVD #3 has the two OVAs (three episodes each).  Great audio, great picture, and the DVD menus are fins (albiet a little plain).

If you're a Slayers fan in need of all the movies and OVAs, this is the cheapest way you'll ever find them.  It's also very space saving over buying them separately.

One last side note about the content of the movies (which has been explained wonderfully in other reviews, so I'm jsut adding my two-cents).  Lena's voice is different from the one in the series.  And at first that feels weird, and then it starts to grow on you, and finally you'll find that it's a great voice for the character and it might sound weird to hear the series voice after watching these DVDs.

Heck, even if you already own all of the movies and OVAs separately, buy this to take up less space on your shelf and sell the old ones to help offset the cost.",1245801600,15,1326,4.1936758893280635
