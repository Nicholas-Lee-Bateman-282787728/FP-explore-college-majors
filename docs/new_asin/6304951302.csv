7879624,3,6304951302,"A Chicago columnist recently lamented that people only know about George Washington Carver and not about the pioneering scientist Dr. Percy Julian.  One could add that people may know about a Black physician like Dr. Charles Drew and this tape gives them an opportunity to learn about another important Black physician Dr. Daniel Hale Williams.

This was a low-budget production.  Clearly someone used a cheap video camera, rather than the fancy equipment most TV stations have.  Sometimes the images would jump, possibly due to a clumsy cameraperson.  I hate cheesy reenactments, and luckily this work lacked them.  Still, the subject matter makes up for the shoddy production quality.

The documentary says the Dr. could have chosen to pass as white, but decided to stay in the Black community.  If he could ""pass,"" then my guess is that he had some European heritage.  I am not clear on the facts, but I would if biracial activists could claim him as a hero.  The work says he was a cousin of Frederick Douglass who was biracial.  The work says that the Doctor tried to open nursing schools for Blacks as much as medical schools.  Though this can be seen as supporting a gendered division of labor, it can also be seen as pro-feminist.  Male allies to women's rights may want to learn more about him.

Many documentaries try to have diverse interviewees.  Recently I have seen many works on famous Blacks that interview men and women, Blacks and non-Blacks.  This documentary, however, only interviewed Black males.  Further, the interviewees' names and qualifications almost never appeared.  The main interviewee wears a skullcap to give himself an ethnic vibe, but it may have just been worn to hide his balding.

The medical procedures described get so technical that I doubt junior high or elementary school students would understand it.  This work may be more appropriate for high school science classes.  This was a fantastic piece to view during Black History Month.",1171411200,,1976,4.981651376146789
