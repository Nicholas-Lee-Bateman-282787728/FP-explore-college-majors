4083600,5,B00389JERU,"I saw this film at Outfest in LA last year, and it was one of the better movies that played there. While the main characters are gay, and Christian, this film is not about either of those things, really. These characters feel like real people, with real contemporary issues - NOT ""HollywoodIronShrekFantasyAvatars"". Its a small movie, but I discovered through imdb that the director has worked on some serious TV shows including The A-Team, Magnum PI, Dukes of Hazzard, and the Pilot for Jake and the Fatman! Seriously, if you told me this guy made a movie about car batteries, I'd probably go see it in theaters.",1274313600,2,613,4.738317757009346
4083601,5,B00389JERU,"This is a heartfelt look into the lives of people who are struggling against societal pressures and judgement. Orlando Jones gives a phenomenal performance as Terry Price Owens, a gay wanna-be daddy who takes matters into his own hands when a Christian woman from the deep south agrees to carry his baby. The problem - her homophobic husband doesn't know about any of this.... for now. This film is directed with a great deal of respect for its characters, but also has a good time unraveling the truth.",1274313600,2,503,4.7272727272727275
4083602,5,B00389JERU,I SAW THIS FILM AT A FESTIVAL. THE DIRECTION IS WONDERFUL AND THE SCRIPT IS HEARTWARMING.GETTING THE SEVERAL FACTIONS TOGETHER WITH HUMOR AND GOOD FEELINGS MAKES THE FILM INTERESTING TO WATCH.,1274313600,4,192,5.225806451612903
4083603,5,B00389JERU,"""MISCONCEPTIONS is a sweet, completely endearing and surprisingly moving comedy with great crossover potential.  It is the story of a conservative Christian woman named Miranda (A.J. Cook), who five years after the death of her young child at the hands of a rare disease, has a vision from God telling her to become a surrogate mother to a gay couple (Orlando Jones and David Moscow) looking to start a family.  Misconceptions skillfully avoids the pratfalls of many socially conscious comedies, never coming off as preachy or heavy handed. It admirably treats both sides as human beings, rather than broad caricatures, never once feeling like it is condescending to its characters or the audience. It is a good natured film, warm hearted, funny, and surprisingly quite moving, using comedy as an emotional and even spiritual journey rather than for meaningless laughs.  Orlando Jones, for his part, has never been better, giving the film's best performance and showing off some dramatic range.""

4083604,5,B00389JERU,"""Misconceptions"" is a sweet and funny look at a culture clash between a Southern religious family and a sophisticated gay couple from Boston.  Both sides of the culture front come off well in this tale of adoption in 21st century America.  Highly recommended!",1273017600,3,259,5.0
8391121,3,B00389JERU,"One of the first films I've seen where the dance between dogma and drama offered compassion balanced with grace.  In light of the homophobia so readily served by those who say they walk the path of faith, we've many a step to take to embrace the grace of unconditional love. Misconceptions offers two steps forward on our journey to live fully in gratitude for the many blessings diversity bestows upon us all.

Why only three-stars?  The music.  If you LOVE Pentecostal preaching music you'll LOVE this film!!

The spirit of diversity! The strength it bestows!
How can we learn to nurture and grow
in a world of plurality, of cultures, of creeds
of restricted resources, yet infinite needs

To survive we must learn, respect, and allow
a diversity of views, of nations, and know
that failure to do so, so clearly denies
the strengths of diversity, our hope in our lives.

8391126,5,B00389JERU,"My husband and I spent 2 days as extras on the set of Misconceptions, and getting to know the people and watching them work, and then seeing a ""glimspe"" of ourselves in the finished product was really fun.  We are hoping the producer, Ron Satlof,  will make another film and invite us to take part again.

8391127,4,B00389JERU,"Maybe not the best written movie I've ever seen (just my opinion), but I really liked its message.  Tolerance, love, etc.  Being truly Christian means we keep intolerance and bigotry out of our lives!  Maybe this movie will open a few minds and hearts.",1275868800,3,252,4.681818181818182
8391128,5,B00389JERU,"Yes, this is a low budget indie film, but it rises well above its limitations. I was throughly entertained and moved by the story, the acting, and the direction.  This is a heartfelt, uplifting film with a wonderful message. It is a shame films like this do not get seen by a wider audience, it packs a powerful message for our divided country. I was left with tears in my eyes and a smile on my face. Highly recommended!

8391129,4,B00389JERU,"This movie is a pleasant surprise. Funny, sincere, light but touching on some touchy issues. There's an unusual feel to it. At first I thought it was almost amateurish but it developed into something very real yet quirky and unexpected at the same time. I've seen it twice and liked it even more the second time.",1274572800,4,312,4.589285714285714
8391130,5,B00389JERU,"I recommend it to all. Misconceptions journeys into the worlds of philosophical, sociological and legal entanglements that result from scientific discoveries creating new and different life situations.  The story line of this light comedy is used as a dressing upon the true messages it covers.",1274572800,4,294,5.533333333333333
