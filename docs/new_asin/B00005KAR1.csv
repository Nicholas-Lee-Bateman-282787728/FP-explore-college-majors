7943041,4,B00005KAR1,"Action films are difficult buisness. Audiences today expect ever impressive action, smooth one-liners and enough explosions to make John McClane jump off a 20-storey building. While these two films don't reach the excellent heights of THE ROCK and FACE OFF, they're still fun entertainment. The pairing of two of Nicholas Cage's most high-octane action-addrenalin films sits together well, with both GONE IN 60 SECONDS and CON AIR making a very satisfying action night. Produced by action maestro Jerry Bruckheimer, CON AIR is one of my favourite Nic Cage films (Second only to FACE OFF). Effortlessly cool, it's a must-have DVD. This has tons of action, smart one-liners, great actors (John Malcovich as ""The Virus"" and Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene) and the Bruckheimer M.O: awesome action and big things exploding. Great fun. Directed by Dominic Sena, GONE IN 60 SECONDS isn't as impressive, and although Cage is cool, Angelina Jolie doesn't do much. Director Sena (SWORDFISH) spends too much time on un-interesting sup-plots and not enough on fun action set-pieces. The last 20 minutes are very exciting though, with a montage of high-speed chases in trademark Bruckheimer style. Not as good as THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, but if you want a fast car chase flick with incredible action, then this is a must.",1034640000,,1310,5.126168224299065
