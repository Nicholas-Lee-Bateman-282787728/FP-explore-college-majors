1882375,5,B00009B1RV,"True confessions here...I don't have any children. I do have, however, a whole slew of nephews and nieces, cousins and friends' children that are at my house often. When it's time for some adult chit-chat, the ""make your kid a genius"" videos would inevitably be produced to entertain said children. Have you ever seen one of them? I'm pretty sure they made me lose a few IQ points with their inane music and terrible production quality, so I shudder to think what they are doing to developing young minds.

Enter Little Laureate...The Little Laureate series (all three of them) are a godsend. They use amazing art, scenery, live action, animation, beautiful music and fantastic production value to create a magical experience for both children and adults alike. All the kids that have seen the Little Laureate series at my house are hooked. And, even better, I actually enjoy watching them over and over. The companion CD with the music that comes with the video is full of music that is wonderful - I have even used it as background music for a dinner party.

Buy all three videos in the series and be prepared to be dazzled - yes, even again and again. (Maybe you'll even get those IQ points back you lost watching the ""other"" baby videos!)",1203638400,,1242,4.692660550458716

1882378,5,B00009B1RV,"This DVD is amazing.  My three children, ages 2, 4, & 5 love it.  They ask to watch little star every time we get in the car because they love to repeat the color words in different languages. They challenge each other to see who can remember the color in spanish and french first.  My 2 year old actually is learning her colors by watching this DVD. I've shown many VHS's and DVD's to my children and they have never asked to watch one more than they have asked to watch this one.  Great job on the presentation of the art pieces with the music.  We LOVE it!!!",1202860800,,561,4.157407407407407
1882379,5,B00009B1RV,"I have purchased all the Little Laureate DVDs (even got them when they were VHS) and am always pleased with the quality and content. My grandchildren love them and I feel that these dvds are definitely adding to their overall appreciation of the world around them. I enjoy them as much as the kids do (aren't we all kids at heart?). I have given them as birthday gifts to my friends' children and they are always pleased because it is not ""another toy"". Little Laureate DVDs are in a class all their own. Buy one for yourself and see.",1202428800,,534,4.404040404040404
1882380,5,B00009B1RV,"My grandchildren and I love all Little Laureate dvds and they are the ones that they watch over and over. I enjoy watching with them and probably have learned as much as they have. Makes me want to take a trip and in the future the grandkids and I definitely will go see some of the same ""sights"". Highly recommend for parents and kids of all ages.",1202428800,,348,4.208955223880597
1882381,5,B00009B1RV,"I bought this video to watch with my grandchildren and love it as much as they do. It moves along at a quick enough pace to keep them attentive and the animation mixed with live footage helps them associate with the children in the video.  Highly recommend for ""kids"" of all ages.",1202428800,,280,4.384615384615385
1882382,4,B00009B1RV,"This video presents gorgeous artwork in a creative way - moving images that sweep across the screen until it is filled.  My children recognized the artwork from ""Goodbye Moon"" and others were new.  My two boys, 3 and 20 months, love this video and it keeps their attention with lovely art, colors and music.  I love to watch this video because it is so beautiful!  I would have rated it higher except for ""Star"".  Star Laureate seems to be disjointed from the art and doesn't present the artwork.  My children love star anyway.  I highly recommend this video.",1170720000,,559,4.642857142857143
1882383,5,B00009B1RV,"I bought the Little Laureate's for the Love of Art in February this year after reading all the reviews and I'm glad that I did.  This is still the only dvd that can capture my 20-month-old daugther; she has been watching since she was eleven-month old and she is still watching today. The production is more tasteful and sophisticated than Baby Einstein.  None of the other DVDs---Baby Einstein, Baby Prodigy or Brain Baby could keep her attention, not even five minutes; I'm glad that I didn't spend $$$ to purchase the Einstein DVD series because the production is so cheesy and cheap.  I borrowed the other Litle Laureate's for the Love of World Travel from a local library but my daughter didn't like it as much. I highly recommend it.",1133049600,,739,4.6692307692307695
1882384,5,B00009B1RV,"I LOVE this video.  My 6 month old loves it as well!  She will sit and watch the entire 30 minutes without a peep.  The music is fantastic and the artwork is amazing.  Unlike other videos, the music isn't annoying to me.  I could listen to the music over and over (which we do) while getting things done around the house while she is watching the beautiful artwork.  The fact that the music and artwork presentation is choreographed so that the art hits the beats in the music is great!

This video is so much better and more appealing than the Baby Einstein videos.  I don't feel like I am watching a home video of toys filmed in my basement, like I do when I watch the other baby videos out there.

I am pleased that there is a video that both my daughter and I can enjoy.  Introducing her to such beautiful artwork at a young age will be much more beneficial to her than watching a toy duck being pulled across the screen.  I highly recommend this video!",1125014400,,957,4.261111111111111
1882391,4,B00009B1RV,"Don't get me wrong; this video is good!  The music is great, the artwork is lovely, and parents can enjoy it even though it's been played 100 times.  However, the artwork/music presentation is like a piece of choreography that was overworked to hit everything in the music and ended up being less-than-pleasing.  And then the makers slacked on editing the scenes/sounds of children talking and doing art.  Also, each peice of artwork shown includes print of the title and artist on the lower corner ON the artwork (not off to the side), interrupting the enjoyment of the art.  The print is very small and hard to read -- really distracting.  Since the artists and titles should be shown somewhere, why not put that information at the end?  This video tries but isn't quite the standard of Baby VanGogh.",1123632000,,802,4.768115942028985
1882392,5,B00009B1RV,"I'm thrilled when our two year old goes to the DVD cabinet, pulls this out and says, ""I want Star!"" Of all the DVDs in our library for our two year old, I prefer this one head and shoulders above the rest. In fact, I enjoy it myself. Unlike other childrens' DVDs, this is wonderful even if it's just playing in the background while the children play with blocks in the next room. The classical soundtrack is refreshing first thing in the morning. And the artwork! I'm glad that my child is being introduced to the beauty of Van Gogh and Picasso at a young age. It's very well done and the artworks chosen are appropriate and enjoyable for children, even including one from ""Goodnight Moon"", one of her favorite bedtime books. The only flaw might be that this is thirty minutes long. My two year old doesn't object to that, but when this DVD is over I find myself playing it again. I wish there was a 60 or 90 minute version for grown ups!",1087603200,,938,4.3352272727272725
1882393,5,B00009B1RV,"I got this from my mother-in-law and have never been so happy with a video for small children. Instead of the mind-numbing, non-educational stuff you see on the other tapes, this video is well-done, highly engaging and has wonderful, stimulating content. Good television watching habits begin with you. What are you showing your baby? Even 5 minutes of this tape is a wonderful addition to your family's home educational plan. Art, classical music, movement, colors, shapes. For the Love of Art = perfection.",1081814400,,508,5.132530120481928
1882394,5,B00009B1RV,"I discovered this DVD through my Moms Club, and I have never been so impressed with a video. I have a 12-month-old, 4 year-old and 9 yr old, and they all love it. Sometimes I play the DVD just for the amazing classical score as lovely background music. And every time I turn it on for my kids, I find myself sitting down to watch just a bit and watching the whole thing.
It is a video meant to be watched *with* your children. We talk about what we see on the screen, what's coming next, colors, shapes, animals... I suppose if you use your VCR as a babysitter and just plop kids in front of it hoping they'll be mesmerized, you should pick a mindless, noisy alternative. But if you want to expose your children to gorgeous works of art with color, texture, pattern and a rich pallete of music, educate and inspire them, this is a wonderful teaching tool. The best I've found in this medium in fact.",1078704000,,899,4.294117647058823
1882395,5,B00009B1RV,"My entire family loves watching these videos! The art is amazing, the music mesmerizing! I have both titles by this company and hope they make dozens more! Thank you for a great product!!",1078704000,,187,4.696969696969697
1882396,1,B00009B1RV,"not sure why, but this movie just did not hold my child's attention.  he enjoys baby mozart etc., baby songs, and usually sits still, enthralled by a movie when i put one on.  this one just did not hold his attention.",1075161600,,217,4.2682926829268295
1882397,5,B00009B1RV,"I am a second grade teacher with a 2, 6 and 9 year old, and this series is by far the best I've ever seen! It's got a broader scope than other tapes, there's more concrete educational material, and the production quality is just AMAZING. I got the DVD -- along with For the Love of World Travel -- for my 2 year old, but my older kids even like watching it. I HIGHLY recommend this series. It far surpasses everything else on the market! Five Stars!",1071014400,,449,4.172413793103448
1882398,5,B00009B1RV,"We got ""For the Love of World Travel"" as a gift and liked it so much, we bought this one as well. We are delighted that it's just as good. My kids are captivated by the art and animation. This is truly one of the best tapes out there. I highly recommend the Baby Laureate series.",1065571200,,279,4.0
1882399,5,B00009B1RV,"Baby Laureate's ""For the Love of Art"" is an exceptional work for young children (and parents too).  They beautifully animated classics from throughout visual art's history.  Your children will be intrigued by the use of color and motion and maintain their interest because of quality content including live action video clips, lovable characters, and pleasant music.  Buy one for every parent you know today!!!",1064102400,,410,5.375
1882400,5,B00009B1RV,"We own them all -- Baby Einstein, Baby Genius, So Smart -- and Baby Laureate is by far the best baby video out there. The production quality is outstanding. And my kids are mesmerized. It's such great educational content as well. I highly recommend this video! You won't be disappointed!!",1061769600,,288,4.78
1882401,4,B00009B1RV,My 2 year old son loves this video. He gets very excited especially for the mascot character Star. It's very cute to watch him interact with something so educational. The art is wonderful too! Highly recommend.,1057708800,,210,4.861111111111111
1882402,5,B00009B1RV,"My 4-year-old son has autism and this tape has been a miracle for us. It's the only thing that captures his attention. He actually sits and focuses for more than 20 minutes! He interacts with the screen in ways I have never seen. He especially loves the Fish section. I have come to treasure the time we spend together watching this tape, as it's one of the few ways I really feel I'm connecting with him. Bless you Baby Laureate!",1053561600,,430,4.3875

1882404,5,B00009B1RV,"...get this tape. It is so much better! The music is a symphony version that includes all the mathematical good stuff that stimulate brain cells. I personally can't stand the canned nursery music on other tapes. The animation makes watching it a joy. We have seen this already about 20 times and I'm not sick of it yet (a miracle). I can't recommend this enough. I've been waiting for a baby video that got it right, and this hits the bullseye.",1052265600,,444,4.493827160493828
1882405,5,B00009B1RV,This is a great DVD. The music and animation is outstanding. My kids like it better than Baby Einstein. Very enjoyable from a parent standpoint as well.,1052265600,,152,4.666666666666667
1882406,5,B00009B1RV,"We own every kids DVD on the market, and the folks at Baby Laureate have outdone everyone with this release. It's a wonderful presentation with the best art and music I can remember seeing, my kids love it, and the DVD has great extra features like being able to play different cuts of the movie. I highly recommend this to anyone with kids!",1052265600,,341,4.428571428571429
1882407,5,B00009B1RV,"This is a great DVD because there are so many different ways to use it. You can watch it normally (which is a treat), or you can play all the animation sequences in a row (my 2-year old loves that). My older children like to play the art-only mode. And I love the soundtrack, which is featured here as well. This is just a great piece of multimedia that allows the whole family to enjoy it. I'm glad someone finally gave us not just extra trailers, but more uses in a DVD.",1052265600,,472,4.141304347826087
1882408,5,B00009B1RV,My kids and I really enjoyed this video. It reminded me of a little kids Fantasia. It was beautiful and relaxing -- a good wind down before sleep thing! Very impressive!,1051833600,,169,4.483870967741935
1882409,5,B00009B1RV,My kids and I just finished watching the tape from beginning to end.  WE LOVED THE MUSIC and the art work.  AWESOME!  If your kids love the Baby Mozart and Einstein tapes they will enjoy this tape as well.,1051660800,,205,4.205128205128205
1882410,5,B00009B1RV,"I received ""For the Love of Art"" as a gift. My 3-year-old son who is quite active and really into trains almost always picks a very active video to watch but when asked one day recently to pick out a video for some quiet time ""For the Love of Art"" is the one he picked!!! It makes me feel good that he actually wants to watch something so good for him.",1051660800,,352,3.971830985915493
1882411,5,B00009B1RV,"i got this as a baby shower gift and it's all i give to my other friends now. it is the best baby video out there. so soothing and wonderful art and great viewing for adults too. my 18 month old loves it. i can't wait to play it for my next baby. if you want to educate your babies, this is the tape for you.",1050278400,,308,3.6818181818181817
1882412,5,B00009B1RV,"I have a 2 and a 5 year old and they just love this video. They have the other baby video series as well, but this one is their favorite. My 2 year old asks for the ""star"" movie several times a day. It makes me feel great to know they are watching great art rather than just kiddie stuff.",1050278400,,288,3.816666666666667

7990379,4,B00009B1RV,"We own the origianl Little Laureate For Love of Art and Love of World Travel.  I have watched clips of the newer ones, but they contain less real artwork and more movie clips.  But either way, this is a great product.  Invest in the original dvd's because they are wonderful and accessible.  If you want to buy the newer ones, go to their website for a cheaper price.  These sellers selling a USED dvd for more than a new one which is available is ridiculous and Amazon shouldn't allow such outrageous prices on their site.",1330905600,,523,4.463157894736842
7990380,5,B00009B1RV,Best DVD ever; my son loves it.  Great for parents to view too.  Narrator talks to star.  Live action scenes of children in park painting. Simply wonderful.,1321920000,,156,4.703703703703703
7990381,3,B00009B1RV,"This product was nice for baby, but my toddler is not interested. In my opinion it's very similar to Baby Einstein.",1302134400,,115,4.523809523809524
7990382,5,B00009B1RV,"The DVD uses a diverse visual pallette to teach little kids about colors. To the backdrop of real classical music, famous paintings are creatively animated to come apart or assemble, with real video captures of natural scenes and children and adults interacting. It's all very calm and engaging without being slow or sedate. Narraration is minimal, and the scenese are all interesting enough to promote questions and dialogue with your little one. My baby girl first saw this at about 1.5 years old and it's still a favorite almost a year later. I can also recommend the other Little Laureate DVD, World Adventure.",1285632000,,614,4.970873786407767
7990383,4,B00009B1RV,"I will say if you're trying this video series, I like the colors one better.  However, this is also a nice soothing video with great music and artwork presenting in a neat way with lots of movement.  My 18 month old really likes it!",1260057600,,232,4.25
7990384,5,B00009B1RV,"These videos are by far my favorite!  This particular one is my son's favorite on of the series.  He loves ""going to Africa"", and he will shout out ""Eiffel Tower!"" before the girls even say it.  He just turned 3 this month.  These videos are educational, the music is beautiful, and you and you kids will love them!",1240272000,,315,4.379310344827586
7990385,5,B00009B1RV,"This is another outstanding DVD.  My kids loved My World Colors and after seeing this one they just can't get enough of ""Little Star"".  They have asked me if they can go to the places in the DVD and see all the neat things.  My children get so excited when I put the DVD on for them.  It's so nice to see my kids interested in these places.  My oldest loves to draw and has been trying to draw some of the art pieces she sees in the DVD.  I definitely recommend these DVD's.",1204588800,,474,3.9893617021276597
7990386,5,B00009B1RV,"Yet again, another great DVD by Little Laureate!  After watching My World Color, I had to get My World Gallery!  My children just love STAR!! I have no problem letting them watch it over and over again because each time they learn something new!  My son drew me a picture and told me it was just like the one Star showed him! Drawing, creating and having fun all on his own is priceless!!",1204156800,,388,4.287671232876712
7990387,5,B00009B1RV,We so loved watching My World Colors together!  I laugh so hard when my kids talk to Star like he's their best friend!
