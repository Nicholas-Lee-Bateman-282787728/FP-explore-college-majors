Demands and requirements of the day deemed that I could not be available on the time schedule that this great detective offering demanded. Now thanks to Amazon dot com's bargain price, I was able to obtain the COMPLETE series, and relive it on MY SCHEDULE. Thanks Amazon",1359331200,,371,4.470588235294118
4908592,5,B005ZEM932,"What more can be said about this incredible television series that hasn't already been said? It is simply one of the best, if not THE best, television series of all time. The shooting locations, the top notch screenwriting, the action, and of course the incredible acting of Jack Lord (and his magnificent head of hair), James MacArthur, Kam Fong, Zulu, and the rest of the cast were (and continue to be) some of the best ever. Although I've been watching this show since the 80's, I started with disc 1 and so far have watched through the second season. The picture quality is great, although one of the discs did have a scratch on it that made one of the episodes freeze up for about a minute. If you're a fan of Hawaii Five-O, you can't go wrong with this box set.

Here's a bit of trivia: Bruce Lee was a huge fan of Hawaii Five-O. He used to teach Jeet Kune Do at a school in the Chinatown section of Los Angeles, and he would begin the class warmups by working out the Hawaii Five-O theme song! (Source: Bruce's long time friend and student, Dan Inosanto). Bruce was actually planning to appear in an episode of Hawaii Five-O, but it was around the time his film career took off in Hong Kong and he wasn't able to work with the production schedule of Hawaii Five-O. He was finally planning to do it after filming Enter The Dragon. Bruce even wrote some of the script and action scenes for the episode he was to appear in, but unfortunately he died before he could film the episode. The only possible way for Hawaii Five-O to get any more epic would have been if Bruce had lived to appear in it.",1359072000,,1600,4.351170568561873

4908596,4,B005ZEM932,"I'm giving this one 4-stars instead of 5. I bought the series on DVD as individually released seasons as they came out. So, I already have this. But is this REALLY ""complete""? Is that ""missing"" episode from the second season, ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" included, if not on the 2nd season DVD box, maybe as an extra on a bonus disc? I know all about WHY CBS never reran that episode back in Summer 1970, and why CBS/Viacom never included that episode for rerun syndication, and why CBS/Viacom/Paramount hasn't included that episode when Season-2 (alone) was released on DVD, but if this ""complete series"" of DVD sets is REALLY going to be ""complete"", then it ""should"" include ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" from the second season! If it turns out that it really does include that episode (which I doubt, however), then I will change my rating to 5-stars from 4!",1358035200,17,854,4.7

4908695,5,B005ZEM932,"A controversy is raging right now that will affect so many movie and TV fans and yet most are probably not aware of it. The sales of DVDs and blu-rays has dropped recently. Most are citing the digital and streaming services that are out there. One thing you need to realize is that if you lose your internet connection or a server crashes all of what you own digitally or watch streaming is suddenly unavailable. This is why I for one support the existence of hands on media in the form of discs. Theyre always there whenever you want them.

And one of the best things to happen with the release of DVDs is the ability to collect a TV series that you either grew up with or have grown to love. A number of these have reached shelves at reasonable prices. Some have come out in season form so that you could purchase them one at a time. But CBS Video has taken it a step further and begun selling off entire series in a box set that takes up less space. It might make for a hefty one time price but it ends up being cheaper than buying each season alone.

With that in mind let me talk about one that is being released this week, a box set heavy enough to make a doorstop. If you grew up in the sixties you knew this show and its theme son, one that got heavy airplay on the radio. I know it was in my collection of 45s from the time (kids ask your grandparents what 45s were). The show took place in Hawaii and revolved around a special state government task force to combat crime. The series was HAWAII FIVE-O and the entire original series is now out in a special box set.

HAWAII FIVE-O told us the story of U.S. Naval Officer Steve McGarret (Jack Lord), an imposing figure who stood tall, wore a suit and tie and was the epitome of a straight up law enforcement agent. The Five-O task force was put together by the governor and only answered to him. Each week the group would take on anything from kidnappers to secret agents, crime lords to foreign spies. No crime was too big or small for them to take on. Well maybe dognapping but little else.

While led by McGarrett he was ably assisted by his team. Danny Danno Williams was a younger officer played by James McArthur. It was McGarretts catch phrase to Williams that most folks remember, the old Book him, Danno. Williams stayed with the series almost as long as Lord, dropping out before the last season.

Also in his task force were two sidekicks. Chin Ho played by Kam Fong who was actually born on Hawaii was an Asian-American actor who actually served as a police officer for 16 years before becoming an actor. He made several movies but it was this series that made him recognizable. The other was Kono played by Zulu. Here again we had another native Hawaiian who made a name for himself in this series.

The islands of Hawaii were a major part of the series too, as if they were a partner in it all. The series was shot on Hawaii, something rare at the time. It exposed the rest of the country to the beauty of the islands with opening shots of clear blue skies, beautiful beaches and swaying hips in grass skirts to the opening theme song that became so familiar and was a hit for the surf rock band The Ventures. There is little doubt that the series, even though it depicted crimes taking place there each week, was a great help in promoting tourism on the islands.

This series was a hit at the time lasting longer than many. It ran for 12 seasons from 1968 through 1980. It lasted for 281 episodes. At an average of 50 minutes per episode that means there are just over 14,050 hours of show to watch. That means it would take 585 days running around the clock to watch the entire series. All of those episodes are gathered together in this box set. Fortunately if you have it on hand you won't have to watch it in consecutive 24 hour time periods. You can take your time and enjoy them as you like and have them bring back memories of the family gathered around the TV set doing so.

As I said, this doesnt come cheap. Right now amazon has it on sale for $116.40 with a suggested retail price of $179.98. But like I said, the amount of episodes coupled with the memories they provide makes it worth the investment for diehard fans. I mean that comes out to about a penny an hour. You cant even park a car that cheap. If you are one of those diehard fans then make a point of picking this one up. The show along with a few extras will make you smile for days to come.",1491955200,4,4438,4.262470308788599
4908696,5,B005ZEM932,"One of my favourite shows and I've already brought the whole 12 seasons separately. Do I have a reason to buy? No, unless there is something special included in this complete series or they release it in blu ray format",1491264000,2,218,4.475

Ocean and land action scenes.  9.  International world threats.  10. The  perfect theme song and cast opening credits including  the  hula girls and  famous high surf wave.  11.  Believable acting because there was a lot actors tension going on during  the set. Perfectionist Jack Lord driving the cast for maximum success.  12.

4908730,3,B005ZEM932,"Before buying, please read all the reviews and ask yourself how badly you want these DVD's.  Since receiving the order, we have watched episodes at random from each season.  Some are fine but others stick and freeze, even after cleaning.  This only happened when we put them in the DVD player.  In the laptop there are no sticking and freezing incidents and they play perfectly.

The order arrived undamaged.  Each season was packaged separately inside a larger box.  The DVD's were in plastic cases.  We could not see any scratches, even on the DVD's that would only play in the laptop.  Subtitles for the hard of hearing and episode promos were available.  Overall we are satisfied with the purchase and do not plan to return it.

I think this show has held up very well despite being so dated.  We laughed at the computers that filled a room, McGarrett's use of the word ""honey"" when referring to females, the big gas-guzzling cars, and we marveled at how well McGarrett kept in touch with his staff without the use of a cell phone.",1482883200,,1035,4.626373626373627

4908732,2,B005ZEM932,"First disk I played was defective; it had smudges on the disk.  The program froze about ten minutes from the end of the pilot episode - disk 1, episode 1.

The disks are squeezed into cardboard slots, making them susceptible to scratching and smudging.  The package is considerably larger than another multi-disk set I bought recently - Murder She wrote, which has roughly the same number of disks.

I may revise this review after viewing a few more disks, but probably won't give it any more stars.  I will probably end up sending it back.

Edited after checking all of the disks - of the 72 disks in the box, 16 were defective.  I ordered another box as an exchange and am checking the 16 disks that were defective in the first box.  So far, disk 2 in set 9 is defective in both boxes.  I will exchange the second box for a third, hoping for a good season 9, disk 2.

I am downgrading my review to one star.

By comparison, I recently ordered a boxed-set of Murder She Wrote.  All 60 disks in that box were OK.  And the packaging was much more convenient; each season was in its own compact box.

Edited again - I finally got season 9 disk 2 working by cleaning it.  (There was no visible smudging but i cleaned it anyway.)  I was able to create a good set by swapping disks, and am giving back one star.",1472947200,2,1306,4.2693877551020405

4908743,5,B005ZEM932,"This is a great set.  It's all 12 seasons of Five-O, except for one episode.  From what I have read, the ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" episode from Season 2 has been removed, via a decree from Producer Leonard Freeman's widow.  Reportedly, someone tried the hanging technique discussed in the show and died.  The episode was on YouTube, but I do not know if it is still there or not.  A lot of reviews criticize the DVD releases that exclude that show, and while I understand wanting the 'complete' set, I actually applaud someone taking such a strong stance and sticking to it for years upon years.  If you want that episode, you just are not going to find it in any official release of the show, so my advice is let it go and enjoy the other years of excellent programming anyway.

What was wonderfully amazing to me is that this is one of a handful of sets with so many DVDS that did not have one single problem in playback, not one.  Every second of every show for every season played perfectly.  The DVDS, roughly six per season, come in a rectangular book-like holder made of sturdy cardboard.  It is not the least bit flimsy.  Each page is colorful and with pictures of the various regulars over the years.  There are two of these books, each containing six seasons.  There are a couple of potential issues here.  First, each disk slides in and out of a slot on a page.  This means being careful when taking them out or sliding them back in to prevent damage from scratching.  The other possible problem is if you get a set where the adhesive or whatever they used to keep the slots firm gives way or is not applied.  Unfortunately, the first book had one of those pages in my set.  The DVD would slide down, preventing the book from closing or being advanced and causing the disk to disappear inside the page if not prevented manually.

The two books rest inside a hard cardboard case.  There is a long blue ribbon inside that you can use to help pull out the books.  The case has wonderful imaging on the front that includes Jack Lord.  The case slips into a plastic covering that has the well-known surf wave on the front.  It's pretty classy and I like it.

The disks themselves are plain in color, but are marked with the season and disk number.  The episodes on each disk are listed by the slots for the disks in the book.  There were usually 24 episodes per season, though I believe Season 11 was 23 and the final season 19.

There is a promo disk included with some nice extras.  There's a documentary that was done during Season 4 and before the show was renewed for a fifth year.  The very private Jack Lord actually did talk for a minute or so during this piece and, in fact, played the guitar for his intro and exit, which I got a kick out of.  Other extras include an Inside Edition piece with James MacArthur talking about Jack Lord's passing.  A few clips from Entertainment Tonight are on the disks, notably the stories of the deaths of Lord and MacArthur.  Also included is the syndicated promo reel which was fun to watch.  The reel promoted the show to stations for reruns.  There are a few other items as well, including a snippet of Jack Lord's appearance on The Mike Douglas Show.  Lord surprised Douglas with a gift of one of his paintings and discussed his ability to paint.  The bad part is that this was just a snippet of his appearance and not even the full segment.  I love extras and the disk had some really nice bonus items for fans, but there could have been so much more.

My biggest con to the DVDs and the one that almost made me give the set four stars instead of five, is the lack of a 'play all' feature for 11 of 12 seasons.  The first season had a wonderful 'play all' button that disappeared after that, to my utter disappointment.  Seasons 2-9 included the 'coming next week' promos with Jack Lord doing the narration.  These were available on the main menu screen with a 'play all' option.  Inexplicably, when you went to the individual episode menu, you once again had the option to play the promos but without a 'play all' for the episodes.  When you used the 'disk menu' option on your DVD remote, it would go back to the individual menu instead of the main menu, which was also frustrating.  There were no promos for the last three seasons and still, no 'play all' for the episodes.  As a devoted fan of the 'play all' option, this was frustrating to the max!

As for series, others have done thorough reviews of this great show.  What I will add are just a few thoughts on having gone back and watched the 12 years over a period of just a few weeks.  First, I did not realize how much I really loved the hint of family that was in the first four seasons that featured Lord, MacArthur, Zulu, and Kam Fong.  The office scenes were more humorous than I had recalled and there was a sense of brotherhood I'd forgotten about.  Zulu was reportedly fired for an on-set verbal rampage, brought on by Lord's ego, a situation most apparently were not aware of during the outburst.  When I read the backstory, I felt sad.  I do like Jack Lord in many ways, but he did have an ego and it got in the way here when it should not have.  This caused the first major change in cast.

Enter Al Harrington as Ben.  Lord wasn't sure of him, but Freeman was, so Harrington was cast.  As I watched the next two seasons, I really felt the loss of the family.  This show was never about the personal lives, not much really, but the one-liners and brotherhood moments were just gone.  I felt that loss strongly.  It also seemed like they tried to push the Ben character a lot at first, and it some ways, it came at MacArthur's expense, and I did not like that.

In Season 7, Harrington was still a regular, but something happened and he was gone around the mid-point, though shows already shot were mixed in with shows without him so Ben was still there.  No one seems to know what happened, but by this point, Freeman had died and Lord had taken on the reins and maybe they just clashed.  That's speculation.  I was happy to see Harrington go as I just never liked Ben.  Don't get me wrong.  When I went to Hawaii years ago, I saw Harrington perform and had my picture taken with him.  He was as nice as can be and his show was incredibly awesome and entertaining, so for me, it was not about the actor, but the character.  He just did not fit.  The shows without Ben in Season 7 usually included Douglas Mossman as Frank Kamana.  I liked Frank so regretted that he was not brought in Season 8.

What surprised me is that as the show progressed, the character of Duke, played by Herman Wedemeyer, progressed.  I'm not sure what Duke was for a while.  He sometimes was still in police uniform and then he'd be in a suit with the Five-O team.  It was a little confusing, but he ultimately became a detective and a full part of the team.  Oddly, when the show aired originally, I was not a Duke fan, but while watching the DVDs, I really grew to enjoy the character.

For the last show of Season 10, Chin Ho Kelly (Kam Fong) was killed off.  I had noticed he had not been in the show that much and then poof, he was gone.  I read something that said Fong wanted the character to retire, but the powers that be wanted Chin killed.  There apparently was a bit of discord, but I am not clear on why.  The big joke here, though, is that when the network did a pilot for a reboot in the late 90s, someone did not do their research and Kam Fong was part of the reboot cast as Chin Ho!  I understand the powers that be were not thrilled with the faux pas.  I guess they thought Kam Fong should have told them.  Point to Fong!

One of the things that the changing scenery in cast affected was the dynamic between Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord) and Danny Williams (James MacArthur).  For a couple of seasons, it seemed to be that their little moments, those little one liners of lightness, and their teaming up together in scenes lessened and almost disappeared.  I never liked that.  Now, I did like it when we saw Danny getting to take charge or those times when it was clear he was a capable of detective and the definitive #2 to McGarrett's #1, but the mix was best when Steve and Danny had their moments.  I felt that in Season 11 a few of those times returned.  There were more jokes about Danny and the ladies, for example.  It was cute and a nice break in between the dramatic scenes.  Unfortunately, MacArthur was weary of doing the same old thing and declined to come back for what was ultimately the last season of Five-O.

MacArthur's departure caused the biggest change for the series.  He was replaced by not one, not two, but three new actors to the show: William Smith of ""Laredo"" fame, Sharon Farrell, and Moe Keale, who had appeared on the show frequently in a variety of characters.  Things were looser, the dress was more casual.  To be honest, the change in attire began a year or so earlier.  It was a little weird.  One day, Steve would be in a casual outfit, surrounded by men in suits.  Then Danny would be casual in one scene, but wore a suit in the next.  They were obviously trying to go with the times, but they struggled to figure out the right mix.

Farrell was fired during the season.  I don't recall the story fully, but there was some on-set problem.  She and Lord did not mix well together, and he reportedly lashed out at her and one thing led to another.  Like Harrington in Season 7, the network simply mixed episodes so that shows with and without the actress aired all season.  I never thought Farrell was a good choice.  They would have done better to bring back one of the female police officers used during show, such as Officer Sandi Welles (Amanda McBroom) who, if I recall correctly, was in four episodes over a couple of seasons.

MacArhur was sorely missed during the 12th season.  They tried to build chemistry between Steve and Kimo (Smith's character, Kimo being a nickname given to the character who was not Hawaiian and whose given name was Jim by Steve), but it was not the same and failed to live up to Danno and that relationship.

Regardless, there were 12 strong seasons of Five-O, the first four being the benchmark that the subsequent seasons never quite lived up to, but which were still a mark above other shows, then and now.

This DVD collection is great, worthy of the five stars, even without the missing show and the extras that could have been included, but were not.",1453593600,9,10448,4.369158878504673

4908771,5,B005ZEM932,"Having purchased the individual season sets, I was not chomping at the bit to buy CBS DVD's initial release in 2013 of HAWAII FIVE-O: THE COMPLETE SERIES, despite the fact that this set was reputed to contain several items that were not available in the season sets,  namely: a) an HD-remastered Season 10 set of new episode transfers (the original Season 10 set was the only season NOT remastered, as they rushed it to stores in time for Christmas); b) a bonus disc featuring vintage content about the series; and c) gorgeous collector's packaging, including disc booklets featuring new still images.  The main reason for passing on this initially:  the retail price was over $350 on Amazon, with a small discount that still kept the price above $300.

However, nearly 2 years have passed, and now Amazon has dropped it to below $200, and there are several Amazon Merchants offering it brand-new for under $150, so when the price from one of these vendors hit $117 (or roughly $10 per season on average), I went for the double-dip.  Happily, I'm glad I did!

The set contains an outer thick, mostly-clear plastic slipcover featuring the iconic wave and series logo, which slides over and secures an inner blue box (featuring the rest of the iconic wave art to match up with the slipcover).  The box opens to reveal 2 small scrapbook-size collectors' books, with the blue book housing the discs for Seasons 1-6, and the yellow book housing the discs for Seasons 7-12, plus the bonus disc.  (It should be noted that the studio-suppressed Season 2 episode ""BORED SHE HUNG HERSELF"" is NOT included in this set, and the disclaimer on the rear outer packaging clearly states this).  The pages feature cardboard inserts for the numerous discs, along with still images of the various series regulars from each season, along with gorgeous Hawaiian background imagery and a listing of each disc's contents (episode title and original airdate).

The discs all feature solid-colored disc art (different from the individual season sets' discs) but the content (menus, episodes, etc.) is exactly the same as the original releases, with the exception of one season: the season 10 discs, which feature the same menus but have pristine new episode transfers, matching the quality of the other remastered seasons.

The bonus disc features the following:  a) a vintage PBS documentary with Leonard Freeman, Jack Lord, and various other producers and co-stars, shot during the filming of the 4th season episode ""Odd Man In"", and is the stand-out highlight of the bonus features, running about 30 minutes in length; b) clips from a vintage 1968 appearance of Jack Lord on the Mike Douglas show, great quality; c) a 'syndication reel' used to help sell the series' reruns to local stations in 1981, featuring lots of ratings info and various clips from the series; quality is pretty low (this can be easily found on YouTube); d) segment from the CBS 1968 Fall Preview featuring Hawaii Five-O, with remastered clips inserted in place of the old original clips; e) segment from ""Inside Edition"" about Jack Lord and his illness, from the late 90s; and f) various ""Entertainment Tonight"" segments about the series and its stars, including a brief clip of Jack Lord being interviewed in 1986 at a Hawaii film festival, and also covering the deaths of Jack Lord and James MacArthur.  Overall, the bonus content comes to about one hour of new material, and is altogether very interesting, although it's a shame it wasn't made available separately for those fans who faithfully bought each individual season but couldn't afford or justify getting the complete series set.

Overall, this is a gorgeous set, and it's worth the double dip for the reasons noted above, along with the added appeal of having (most) every episode of the series contained in one box set that looks great on your shelf (although it is a tad on the heavy side and physically much larger than the individual releases).

NOTE: As other Amazon reviewers have noted, the sleeves hold the discs pretty tightly in some instances, while in other instances the discs are sticking out a little more loosely.  Numerous Amazon reviewers have suggested that this cardboard configuration has the potential to scratch the bottom of the discs, possibly rendering them unplayable.  Therefore, I highly recommend playing each episode briefly on each disc to verify that there are no manufacturing issues rendering them unplayable, and check the bottom of each disc for any major scratches (I've found minor ones can often be buffed out with cotton swabs and a dab of rubbing alcohol).  A few Amazon reviewers noted that Season 4, Disc 3 does not load or play properly; however, my disc 3 played just fine without issue, although I did have a problem with Season 10, Disc 4's ""The Silk Trap"" not loading.  However, I was able to make a copy of this disc using a DVD copying software, and the copy played just fine for some reason.  As of this writing, I have not encountered any other issues playing any of the other episodes in the set to date, but I'm only about halfway through checking them, and will note any other issues as I find them.

OVERALL REVIEW SUMMARY: Highly Recommended (with some slight reservations due to disc playability); if you're double-dipping, wait until you find an Amazon Merchant offering it for around $120, or whatever your sweet spot is!  You won't regret it if you're a die-hard H5O fan!",1439164800,11,5447,4.897826086956521

4908840,4,B005ZEM932,"Let's start by saying you have to be a fan--a big-time fan.  Great series, some episodes better than others of course, but consistently an appealing crime drama with nice scenery.  The mastering is pretty good taken from prints averaging 30 years old. That ""thing"" CBS has airing now offers improved HD photography of Hawaii, but aside from the occasional (and rare) good script, it's mainly schlock with mediocre actors cast in more of a dramady.  Too much dumb comedy and tedious banter, but that's what programmers think people want these days.  Anyway.....this DVD set is the real Hawaii Five-O, so if you're a true fan you'll want it in your collection.  Buy it and then watch episodes from it on Friday nights rather than Nuevo Five-O.",1396310400,,741,4.849206349206349

4908843,5,B005ZEM932,"Don't pay any attention to the one-star complainers, this is a wonderful set and beautifully produced.  Sharp colors, lively music, and a great cast combine to make it a timeless classic.  Like many series, it starts out a bit thin but becomes more and more satisfying with each additional season!  I was concerned that the stories might be too predictable and dated.  Not at all!  The scrips are remarkably complex for their time and would hold up well even in a current-day setting.  Fortunately, these were filmed in the late 1960's and early 1970's, so we can revel in the hair, clothes, make-up, cars, phones, and all the retro furnishings.  I love it that they have to dial the phones, ""fire up"" the big, clunky, room-sized computer, and rely on old-fashioned police work to solve the crimes.  No graphic blood and guts, no foul language or excessive nudity and sexual situations, no sick psycho villains to endure, just good clean drama and satisfying stories to enjoy.  This series is well worth the price for hours and hours of enjoyment!",1394150400,3,1047,4.804469273743017

4908845,5,B005ZEM932,"I remember my Mom and Dad talking about this show, and I remember watching the reruns after which I immediately decided to visit ""The Islands."" The scenery was and is beautiful as well as full of history. The characters were real to me and were ""cool"" because they were developed and at the same time mysterious. If I was in trouble, I wanted someone as strong, tough, caring as Steve McGarrett or Danny Williams or any of the Five-O team to keep me safe or come to the rescue. There was plenty of action without unnecessary gunfire. McGarrett used his brains and the law to keep order and solve crimes.  There was also mystery as you rarely got a look at any of Five-O's personal life. It took a long time to find out that McGarrett or Danny Williams had a personal life and when we finally saw it, it was discreetly portrayed. This series was story driven which does not happen much any more.

I realize that times have changed and so has broadcast television. This is not necessarily for the better as far as I am concerned. That is why I am happy to have this collection to view as a reflection of the world situation back when it was originally broadcast, you could almost say a ""more innocent"" time in America. No violence for violence's sake. No unnecessary explosions.  And the personal lives were not shared. Good was good and evil was evil. You didn't have to wonder who was who,",1393372800,5,1389,4.460629921259843

4908858,1,B005ZEM932,"I was skeptical about ordering this set based on past negative experiences the dreaded ""coin holder slot"" packaging.  But Amazon put it on sale for $139.99 so I took a shot, ordering from Amazon (as opposed to a third party seller) so that I would not get burnt if I had an issue with the discs.  So glad that I did.

I spent HOURS checking all 72 discs.  About 50% of the discs had either scratches or glue residue (thanks to the cut rate coin holder packaging) and required cleaning with a soft clot.  I knew I would have to discard the original packaging because reinserting the discs would subject them to further damage.

Given all that, the S4 D3 disc was the deal breaker.
When played in my DVD player, this disc skips the standard CBS splash screen when you first load it and starts to play the first episode on the disc (""Burning Ice"").  It is then possible to navigate back to the episode menu,  However, two of the episodes that should be on the disc (""A Matter of Mutual Concern"" and ""Nine, Ten -- You're Dead"" are COMPLETELY MISSING. They are listed on the episode menu, but when you select them and hit play, you are presented with pieces of ""Burning Ice"" (already on S4 D3) and ""Bait Once, Bait Twice"" (which is in it's entirety on S4 D4) instead of the expected episodes.

This must be a manufacturer defect.  Three other buyers have pointed out problems with this S4 D3 disc on the boxed set.
Strangely, I see no mention of the problem in the review for stand alone Season Four set.
Needless to stay, my boxed set is on it's way back to Amazon, who, to their credit, issued a no questions asked refund.",1392508800,30,1619,4.384615384615385

Yep, I give 5 stars to amazon for excellent customer service and sending me a replacement box, but the exact same disc had a problem and would not load in either a DVD player or computer.  So I give Paramount a big zero for quality control.  And it's a shame too, because it is a nicely done box, but what good is it if one disc is bad?",1392249600,13,565,3.9210526315789473

The whole set was done years ago but no, lets release each season a year or so at a time, then when all the suckers bought them up we'll just put it all out as a complete box set....F this!!!!!!!!

4908864,3,B005ZEM932,"This ""complete series"" volume comes in a very handsomely packaged set.  The heavy outer box holds two book-like items, each with beautiful scenes from the show.  The thick leaves of the books form the cardboard sleeves holding the DVD discs.  As other reviewers have noted, cardboard sleeves do not afford the best protection for discs.  About four or five discs were noted to have fine scratches upon first removal from their sleeves, however these very light scratches did not seem to affect the play quality.  Season 4, Disc 3 was so badly scratched it would not load in the (computer based) DVD player.

Happily, Amazon provided a complete replacement set.  However, again Season 4 Disc 3 has scratches.  (I note another reviewer pointed out the same problem with the SAME DISC.  Maybe it's a production problem.)  This time, I was able to get WinDVD player to operate this disk, but it won't load on VLC Player.  So I suppose I will just have to watch this disc in a different player.

If you want a collector's set that really looks good this is for you.  (Other than the missing episode from Season 2, mentioned elsewhere.)  On the other hand, if you really expect to watch these shows often, you might want to find a set that comes in plastic cases rather than cardboard sleeves.  In any case, if you purchase this set I recommend you open it upon receipt and actually check each disc to confirm they are good.  I didn't play every disc all the way through, just loaded each one and ran it a little bit.  I'm glad I did.

Amazon is really great about merchandise replacement but there is a limited time deadline.  Don't make the mistake of putting this on a shelf and watching it over the next year or so.  You might find an unpleasant surprise later on.",1389398400,47,1762,4.568690095846645

4908874,3,B005ZEM932,"First, the title of this series is, was and ALWAYS will be (as any true fan knows) HAWAII FIVE-0, with a zero.  The series, and the team, were named after Hawaii being the 50th state.  Hence a five and a zero.  FIVE-O (with the letter O) makes absolutely no sense. Renaming it FIVE-O to differentiate it from the new series is stupid. Both series are named FIVE-0.

Second, as others have noted, the collection is not complete without ""Bored She Hung Herself.""  (There is no actual comma in the title.) Yes, there are legalities preventing it from being released but the episode itself is harmless enough despite its history of allegedly causing a death.  On the other hand, it is not a particulary good episode and the ending is especially stupid so it's no big loss, but for completeness' sake it should be released.

Third, yes, the 1997 pilot should be included because it continues the plotline of the original series (even though it somehow brings Chin Ho back to life, but this is not the first time this sort of thing has happened in fiction.) Also I would have liked to have seen the two-part version of the original pilot (""Cocoon"") as broadcast by CBS in the spring/summer of 1969. The opening/closing credits and the editing were closer to the first-season episodes rather than a separate movie.

Also, the pilot of the new Hawaii Five-0 could have been added to allow viewers to see that if they hadn't already.  Not only could they fit all the pilots (1969 part 1, 1969 part 2, 1997, 2010) on a special pilot DVD disc but it may have encouraged some viewers to buy the new series on DVD as well.",1376092800,32,1609,4.559027777777778

Also include some extras like The 5-0 pilot from 1997 which featured James 'Danno' MacArthur. Don't disappoint, as with the multiple DVD blunders/recalls along the way to a complete The Fugitive.

Every single classic tv show sell each season for a high cost when they first come out.  I bought each season of the Andy Griffith, I love Lucy, I Dream of Jeannie at an average cost of $40 per season.  Only to find out later I could have bought the complete season sets for less than $100.  Another case is the Twilight Zone, both dvd and blu-ray season by season when they came out was about $50-$60 each.  Later I was able to get the complete DVD set for about $100 and the complete blu-ray set for about $150 compared to $400-$500 if you go season by season.

8489593,5,B005ZEM932,I bought this sent not for myself but for an elderly friend who doesn't use the internet and has only rabbit ears.  Her station dropped this version of Hawaii 5-0 and I ordered it for her.  This series is one of her favorite series--likes Jack Lord.,1522108800,,249,4.391304347826087
8489594,2,B005ZEM932,"This review is not about the series. It's one of my favorite shows. It's for the box set. Only half way into the 2nd season, and I'm about done wasting my time. So far numerous episodes have not played. The last disc I tried, I believe season 2, disc 3, only two of the four episodes played. I would say don't waste your money on this, and instead by the individual seasons. Such a shame they put out a beautiful box set and didn't bother to produce good quality discs.",1521849600,,469,4.222222222222222
