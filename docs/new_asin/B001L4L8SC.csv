8356234,4,B001L4L8SC,"Cannibal Cheerleader Camp may have only been about 18 minutes long, but I thought it was very enjoyable and interesting. Basically, five girls were relaxing at a summer home of some sort when a cannibalistic intruder disrupted their peace. Despite the length, I thought there was enough personality given to the girls so we had an idea as to who they were. The killer's identity remained unknown, but then that is the way it is in real life sometimes -- someone comes along and kills a person or persons and then gets away, with the police unable to figure out what happened and who did it. In this case, the viewer doesn't know who did it, either. Nice movie for what it was. It also had some nice lesbian shower action, for those who like that sort of thing.",1271376000,,760,4.474820143884892
