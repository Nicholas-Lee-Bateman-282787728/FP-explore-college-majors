8446338,5,B004X63RVG,"I want to recommend this unusual set of four discs, but I want to be careful about who I recommend it to. If you are looking for a collection of shorts that are hilarious or show first class performers, skip this set. You will be disappointed. Most of the comics here are unfunny and most of the performers are from the  ""B,"" ""C,"" and even ""D"" lists (although some still entertain). But if you love early film and would enjoy a unique time capsule, order this now. These short films from 1926-1930 were made using early sound technology (which still sounds good, by the way) and then were quickly forgotten for 80 years. They feature a spectrum of popular and unusual acts from vaudeville circuits and night clubs. Zip ahead 80 years and what was once ephemeral junk has become a fascinating relic of bygone humanity. We have very little film with audio from the 1926-1930 era (1,000 Vitaphone shorts were made and many of these are lost). You will truly enter another world and culture with these films. 80 years may not seem like much, but our sensibilities have changed to such a degree that this might as well be a set of films from another planet. This is what is so fascinating about this project and what makes this set a the equivalent of museum in a DVD package.
Some observations:
1) What initially surprised me as I watched these shorts was how non-photogenic so many of these people are. Here we have teeth crying out for orthodontics, noses demanding plastic surgery, waistlines screaming for weight watchers, hairdos and mustaches pleading for stylists and barbers, etc. But, interestingly, people in this era seemed to lack all the obsessive self-awareness that men and women have today. After all, If no one got their nose fixed, who cares if you have a beak? If every woman you know has chunky thighs and fat calves, why spend ten hours at the gym every week trying to keep up?  And as for the guys, a haircut (even a very bad one) and a tuxedo (even a dusty, wrinkled one) will do. No bronzer, facials, manicures, eye lifts, moisturizers, pectoral implants, personal coaches, thank you. A shave and a shower is all you needed. And you could pass on the shower for a few days as most of the men you knew did so. It was a different world - and perhaps a much more relaxing and comfortable one. Here you will see men and woman before decades of celebrity and beauty magazines made us all so vain, artificial, and plastic and homogenized looking.
2) Male behavior: some of the men in these shorts have behaviors that veer off into effeminacy. It is difficult to tell if they are gay of if these men simply were less self and gay aware. I suspect the latter. Perhaps men just acted in whatever ways felt comfortable at the moment; perhaps even ""straight"" men camped up without any alarm over their social image or how they were perceived. Male behavior may not have been so hardened into what was acceptable or masculine yet. I suspect that many gay men back then had little or no self-awareness. You have to wonder if that ignorance was blissful or a source of discomfort. From the relaxed way they present themselves in these films, I suspect it was blissful. They seem to be having a great time entertaining us. The again, these may simply be heterosexual men who feel comfortable (because it was socially acceptable and it didn't have any subtext) throwing in some effeminate mannerisms now and then for fun, humor, or because they've had a few drinks beforehand.
3) Forget political correctness. There is crude ethnic humor here and no apologies. You may be offended; I wasn't. I'm more offended by speech police trying to censor and straitjacket the English language and free speech. Now if only some of this was funny.
4) There is some talent here that holds up even after all these years, but it is more the American Idol ""runner-up"" type of talent. The ukulele and harmonica fast blues number performed by the awful comedy act, ""the Stantons"" on disc one blew me away. It could have been done by the sixties group, ""Canned Heat.""
If anything I have written intrigues you, this set is for you. Yes, there are tedious moments and stretches. Yes, you will sometimes think, ""What am I watching and why?"" But there are other times when you will think, ""Wow. This is something."" Watch this in small bits. You can't watch all 9 hours of this in one sitting.
This is a DVD-R set but it played perfectly in my $30 dvd player I got from Wal-Mart.",1335225600,64,4458,4.5852130325814535

8446340,5,B004X63RVG,"Enjoyed this collection of shorts very much. Great to see entertainment as it was in the 1920's with many long forgotten Vaudeville singers, musicians, comedians and others doing their thing in talking film at its infancy. These shorts are a rare insight into 1920's popular entertainment. The quality of the subject matter is variable with such a huge selection on offer. Many are good, some bad and quite a few with the power to still shock. These films are restored to a degree and the sound is surprisingly good. This 4 disk set is well worth owning.",1309824000,18,554,4.721649484536083
