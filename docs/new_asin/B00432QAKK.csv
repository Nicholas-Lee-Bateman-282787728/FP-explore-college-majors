4252675,4,B00432QAKK,Looking forward to seeing all the missed episodes from over the years. Glad to see it all in one package finally! Did double take when pricing it out though. Bought on Amazon.ca at $97CA. Currently now at $46CA.,1296864000,6,211,4.578947368421052
4252676,4,B00432QAKK,"This review will not focus on the merits of this classic TV show since anyone visiting this page already likes it enough to possibly buy the entire series on DVD.  Rather, this review will hopefully clear up the confusion regarding exactly what is being offered with this Complete Series collection.  Sony originally released the individual seasons on DVD from 2003 to 2009.  This 2010 Complete Series collection simply repackages the exact same DVDs from the individual seasons.  There are 32 discs in all spanning the entire 11 seasons for a total of 261 episodes.  Unfortunately, there is no episode list included showing what episodes are on each disc.  The bonus content is slim and includes:

Season 1- 42 minute 2003 reunion special with all of the principal cast members.
Season 2- 13 hidden ""Easter Eggs"" featuring short interview clips with the cast.
Season 3- 10 hidden ""Easter Eggs"" of cast interview clips + the unaired ""I'll See You in Court"" episode.
Seasons 4 to 11- No series related extras.

It should be noted that the opening theme has been replaced with generic music starting with season 3 due to music licensing issues.  Also, season 4 has 7 episodes that are the syndicated versions, meaning each is missing about a minute of footage from the original broadcast versions. All other seasons appear to have the original, uncut episodes.  The video is presented in its original full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio and the audio is in 2.0 Dolby digital stereo.  Neither the picture nor sound quality shows any noticeable signs of remastering but are still generally good considering the age of the series.  The packaging is also worth mentioning as it is very different than the individual season sets.  The discs are housed inside a cardboard box measuring approximately 7.5""H x 5""W x 5.5""D.  Inside the box, there is a fold-out digi-pack with 9 clear plastic trays stacked on top of one other on either side, holding 2 overlapping discs per tray, with 4 trays holding 1 disc each.  Only time will tell just how well this case keeps its contents secure, but in terms of being a space-saver, this excels over other complete series DVD sets.  In 2011, Sony re-released another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Married-With-Children-The-Complete-Series/dp/B005CGI4EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Married...With Children: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;DVD set but with much cheaper packaging comprised of discs stacked on top of one another in two separate spindles.  The re-packaged version is clearly the better option for those on a tight budget, but the original digi-pack release is superior in terms of its convenience and better protection of discs.  Over all, despite some of the aforementioned drawbacks, there are still enough positives with the Complete Series collection to entice fans who do not already own the individual season releases.",1292284800,176,2903,5.3150984682713345
4252677,5,B00432QAKK,"Just add up what each season would cost you ( like I spent) and you will see this is a HUGE bargain! YES.. the ""theme music is not the same"" WHO CARES!!.. If you are like my you hit ""skip"" and just breeze past it anyway.

If you don't have thee.. get this!
I am getting it because I play them so much at work that they are getting scratched up my DVD player.",1292112000,5,358,3.8378378378378377
4252678,5,B00432QAKK,"This year, I became an avid Married... With Children fan after watching reruns on TBS and on Netflix. I fell in love with just about every season. This show relates to my family just about the same. If you are just like me, and you don't have a season on DVD yet, and you can't figure out which one to buy first, then this is a route to go. So what, if the specs for the DVDs are the same as the original releases? You bought this show to rewatch the hilarious moments we saw back then, and nothing else.",1292112000,3,504,4.05
4252679,2,B00432QAKK,"While a complete series collection is always a good thing, the most important thing to keep in mind is that it still has the flaws of the previous releases.  The theme is still missing and replaced by generic music, the episodes are still cut and are syndicated versions, and price is a few dollars more than buying the seasons separately.  That will probably fall over time.

A good deal if you're a fan, but nothing has been fixed.  All the discs are still the same from their original releases.  No theme, cut episodes, et cetera.",1291593600,72,533,4.568421052631579

as another reviewer pointed out the box is smashed and already has dents and creases.  if this was given as a gift probably be shocked by the box being smashed/dented like this. Also wish the packaging and box was sturdier and stronger. Even Three's Company's box is really strong and sturdy.

Almost every episode has additional lines that were cut on the TV broadcasts either because of time constraints or content.
Also on the last disc the second part of the three-part series ""Breaking Up Is Easy To Do"" shows Al sliding across the floor in underwear and socks to the tune of ""That Old Time Rock N' Roll"" done by some unknown musicians and not Bob Seger as on the TV version as he parlays what Tom Cruise did on ""Risky Business"".  Again, must of been some music royalty issues.

4252720,2,B00432QAKK,"I'm only giving this 2 stars because it is a very good price. This is one of those ""must see tv"" packages. I have ordered three different tv series from this must see tv line and each one has arrive with crushed and absolutely distroyed packaging dispite that it was shipped wrapped in bubble wrap. The box housing all the disks is no thicker than the paper used to make greating cards and is simply not strong enough to hold this many disk. Also, I have purchased a lot of classic tv shows on DVD and so far this show had the worst image quality of any of them. Looks worse than VHS quality and I played it on a small 10"" screen.

4252727,5,B00432QAKK,"Yes, you read right, this is the complete series with every dysfunctional episode.
Only a few notes about this: The packaging is made from material not much better than card stock, and the video quality isn't quite high definition and there are no special features besides the menus. Still, this fits in with the quality of life that the Bundy family enjoys. So stock up on bon-bons, weenie-tots, and sit back and relax while you watch a family who has it worse off than most (especially the Cosby's).",1512259200,3,501,4.704545454545454

I even had to ask my partner if the DVDs were previously used.  The outsize case is slightly smaller, so the  dvd's don't fit fully in the case. This worried me that they would fall out when I picked up the case, so I had to turn the DVDs upside down, so now they are a more exposed. The DVDs were also packaged extremely poorly on the inside. There are 21 discs with 2 dvds on each size of a small paper slip. Other than the packaging issues, the show its self is still wonderful content.

 I would say to get this only because there's very little married with children complete series out there.",1492732800,3,731,4.27536231884058

4252903,5,B00432QAKK,What can I say? Other than the BEST PROGRAM EVER!!! If you want a great laugh then this is the program to watch especially the episode when Marcy Darcy is asked if she is Bruce Jenner. This tv show was ahead of its time and Fox ruined it. They were king of the world when this show was on and they destroyed it. It would be back on if they would have let the staff have a send off episode with a party like they do to so many other programs. Screw you Fox.,1475884800,4,456,3.8617021276595747
4252904,5,B00432QAKK,"I loved this show in my younger days.  The earlier seasons were the best.  This version has the original opening song (Love and Marriage) however they didn't put it in at the right timing (so the different sound cue's don't line up like they used to).  A very minor inconvenience though.  For the price you are getting all of the seasons, every episode, and they are in good quality.

4252910,5,B00432QAKK,"What's great about this set is that each episode is labeled on the DVD, along with the season number and the DVDs are numbered in order. This makes organization of the set very easy! There are no subtitles, but that's not as big a deal. There is also the question of how many of these DVDs are using the syndicated version and not the original master version, but I personally can't tell. If these are syndicated, then I would be greatly disappointed. As it, good collection and very much worth the $30 price tag.",1474502400,8,513,4.468085106382978

4252913,4,B00432QAKK,"At least one belly laugh per episode. It's doubtful that this show would be made nowadays. The packaging is terrible. What you get is a cheap cardboard book that opens up to expose two wells that the discs are stacked on. One side came loose in my hands. The index is stuck onto the back cover with the actual index facing the box. Very unhandy. Other than that the set is pretty decent. The picture & sound quality is good except for a few of the shows on the early season 4 disc. Unsure why, but it's less than optimal. My set was bought used at a good price.

4252926,5,B00432QAKK,"There's not much to say. Married with Children is the greatest TV series of all time! The whole cast has become legendary and the writing was top notch. This was a time period of entertainment where you can be witty, creative and not held to any BS standards from people who got there feelings hurt in this modern PC society. It was sexist, crude, vulgar; it constantly pushed the line of PC boundaries. If anyone can take a lesson from MWC it's that our society is still primitive, and to step back and see the ridiculousness and silliness of it all and just laugh; maybe we can have peace.",1471996800,,591,4.431192660550459

4252978,4,B00432QAKK,"As others have pointed out:  This has a cheap case.  The discs are kept in envelopes, not plastic holders.  The episodes are digitized so that a large number fit on a single disc, which reduces video quality.

That said:  It's still great to see the Bundys again.

This set gives the whole series.  Begins with the Bundys living next door to Steve and Marcy, both of whom were successful bankers.  Eventually Steve loses his job and then runs away.  He returns for a single episode every now and then, each time he was a complete loser.  Marcy eventually marries a free loader named Jefferson D'arcy, giving Marcy the cartoon like name of Marcy D'arcy.  She slowly becomes a completely insane, man-hating, control freak.

The Bundys start out as a poor, and slightly criminal family.  Al an overworked Father.  Peg a lazy housewife.  Kelly a promiscuous and beautiful teen.  Bud was book smart and street dumb.  Over the series each deteriorates into a complete wreck.  Al loses all self-respect, and any reason to live.  Peg's looks fade, and she basically tortures Al.  Kelly's IQ drops with each season, and she goes from Tramp to full Slut.  Peg and Al ruin Bud's chances at college, and condemn him to a life with them.

The many seasons give the audience countless hilarious episodes.  Several vacation episodes, where they almost get killed.  The serial killer episode is still one of my favorites.  Several Christmas episodes:  Including a Sky Diving Santa crashing into the Bundys backyard, and an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" episode, where the world was much better off without Al. Several game show episodes also.

Married with children is a Great Satire.  Enjoy!",1461456000,,1670,4.867857142857143

It was almost devastating to see it finally come to and end, and it seemed like the actors weren't even told until the last second that they were out of a job after the last episode.

The cardboard slots that hold the DVD's makes them very vulnerable to scratches. All of the DVD's were very badly scratched, because of the packaging. Mill creek needs to switch back to the paper sleeves, because the new packaging scratches the disks badly, and does not protect them at all, from being scratched more. The episodes are good quality, and every episode has the original Frank Sinatra theme at the beginnning of each episode. Please switch back to putting the dvds in paper sleeves, so they are protected better. I wouldn't recommend buying this, until it is packaged better. But, if you do, I would recommend buying the combo packs from Mill Creek, as they are organized much better!! But, again, the show itself gets 5 stars!",1454716800,,898,4.837662337662338

If you love this show show buy this it is worth every penny. The real ""love and marriage"" theme is on all of the episodes, which is awesome because if you ever bought the season sets back when they put those out they had to use a lame replacement song because they could not get the rights. The only bad thing I can say is the box set packaging is very cheap, all 21 discs come in loose little paper slip cases (sort of like tiny LP record holders) that are just sort of in a pile and there is no printed book or paper slip to make it easier to figure out what episode is on which disc at a glance (episodes are written on the discs though). But seriously for just slightly more than 20 bucks I cannot believe you can get all 262 episodes in a 21 disc set, this is amazing!!!",1453939200,,915,4.088888888888889

I used the one where Peggy asked Al if he missed her when she went on a trip to my wife.
He answered, ""With every bullet so far."" So did I.
We can all relate to it. We've all had rotten jobs at one time or another no matter how hard  we tried.
And have known people with unappreciative kids and wives.
We came through in spite of it just like Al.

Spend some quality time with the family as you join hard-working husband Al (Ed O'Neill), housework-hating wife Peg (Katey Sagal), sexy daughter Kelly (Christina Applegate) and hopelessly horny son Bud (David Faustino) to celebrate the landmark TV sitcom Married With Children. For 11 seasons it was brilliantly tasteless, daringly raunchy and a devilishly clever comedy that put the fun in dysfunctional.

4253086,5,B00432QAKK,"We have been watching and rewatching this whole box set for the past 5 years. We just love this timeless sitcom. This series is raunchy but not too raunchy and is just hilarious!! Al hates fat women and works in a Women's shoe store, Bud is a horny virgin and loves his blow-up doll, Kelly is ditsy and a bit slutty, Peggy doesn't work and also doesn't cook or clean , they hate their neighbors but see them ever day, and their dog, Buck, gets neglected.

This set includes two spindles on each side of the box when opened. Each side will hold half, or just over half of the discs. There is also two more folds when opened all the way. To keep the discs in their place, you need to fold in the outer flaps, which will cover the disc spindles, then you can fold the spindles toward each other like a book. At that point, you can put the discs back in the sleeve to keep everything together.

I can't say enough about this sitcom. It's just plain hilarious!",1452211200,,955,4.241758241758242

If this case breaks, you are SOL as I am sure you won't be able to find another one. Whenever you slide a disc in and out of the sleeve it makes a sand-papery type of sound and you can pretty much hear the disc being scratched each and every time the disc is removed. 5* for the series, 2* for the overall packaging and presentation, avoid this like the plague.",1450742400,2,578,4.078947368421052

Just looking at it before I opened it, I could tell this was a mistake. When you open the case, you will find this weird plastic box that holds all 11 disks which are in paper envelopes. So low quality of production, it is insane. I thought this was a steal at only 25 bucks, but no- they probably made like $15 profit. With a deep sigh, I took out a disk and put it into my blu ray player knowing it was going to be poor video quality. What a shock, the video quality is TERRIBLE (V:4 A:8). This is mostly because they crammed so many episodes onto one disk. Spend a few extra bucks and get much better quality product!!",1449878400,37,789,4.1568627450980395

4253124,5,B00432QAKK,"I can confirm that this has the original Frank Sinatra song which is awesome! I loved this series growing up but I've never had the chance to watch it all and now I do! Ok some specifics:

This is a great, no frills package with all discs for people who just want the series and don't care about the accoutrements. The case is a big plastic box that is strong (comparable to other DVD boxes) with all the DVDs contained in the center on top of one another in paper cases. They're bulk produced and there isn't many special features. The outside insert doesn't look as if it came from some crappy printer (which is a danger with these bulk printed things). The cases containing the DVDs is all black which matches the interior. It's a small thing but it's all very sleek. The DVDs are easy to put in and pull out of the center container but there isn't much holding it there so if you have kids who get a hold of things and like to experiment, then I could see the discs getting loose and moving around an issue; however, when I got it in the mail, all the DVDs were together and I assume it was knocked around a bit in transit. In short:

Pros:
- Good video and sound quality (nothing deteriorated due to mass production. Looks just like it did on TV!)
- Original Frank Sinatra song
- Sleek, simple design
- Good quality printing (doesn't look cheap)
- Simple packaging with all DVDs in one small box (doesn't take up too much shelf space)
- Efficient burning of DVDs (all of season 1 is on one disc and the rest of the seasons aren't spread out across too many discs)
- Easy to get out of the packaging (simple shrink wrap)
- Easy to put it and get DVDs out of the case

Cons:
- DVDs are loosely held in case so they might get loose if you
- Not a big box set with tons of special features
- No insert with episode details (however, every disc has the episodes and season printed on it)

TL;DR: If you just want a box set with all the episodes to watch and nothing more, this will more than suffice.",1449532800,6,2000,4.187012987012987

Mill Creek releases are hit and miss
They do surprisingly good on blu ray's
dvd's I'm not sure
As of late Mill Creek has taken a huge chunk of distributing rights from Sony to put out box sets at a decent cost

I remember paying close to $25.00 for season four when it first came out on dvd!
For someone who bought every season when they were distributed by Columbia/Sony Pictures
The PQ is hinky to say the least (Nothing was remastered)
So what you get from Mill Creek  shouldn't be to bad at all
If some episodes are edited does it really matter??? There's a massive list of tv shows on dvd edited (we get the syndicated tv cuts more then we think) I'm pretty sure every season of In Living Color on dvd  was edited
plus the theme song  Love and Marriage  by Frank Sinatra was removed on the first run dvd's after season three if I'm correct?
The original theme song has been wipe from the syndicated versions on tbs at 5am every morning!
Pick your poison do you wanna over spend on a complete set (buying season by season or just buy the whole thing out-right for a reasonable price
a complete series that isn't perfect but, the positives out weigh the negatives
The only major downfall to this set is the packaging (I've heard Mill Creek does this with all there complete series box sets)
That's cheap but, to see it from there point of view i guess that's what keeps the cost down
You get a lot of bang for your buck 5991 minutes for less then $30.00 that's a steal
but, buy some thin cd jewel cases to put each dvd disc in to protect them better
If i didn't  already have the full season I'd jump on this in a heartbeat it's a amazing deal  9/10",1446422400,2,1699,4.25776397515528

My only complaint is that I feel the boxing could have been done differently.

4253200,3,B00432QAKK,"This is a brief technical review of the 2015 Mill Creek release and not a review of the great show itself, which includes an observation that I haven't seen discussed elsewhere: Even though the ""Love and Marriage"" theme has been reinstated for seasons 4-11, Mill Creek was so lazy and careless that they apparently sourced the soundtrack from the Seasons 1-3 intros, which included a couple shots of a Chicago freeway.  Since these shots were (originally) deleted from the intro beginning with Season 4, the ""clink"" of the title stamp that says ""With Children"" is now out of sync and actually occurs later in the sequence, usually after Katey Sagal's credit and right on Amanda Bearse's.  I checked this for every season and it isn't corrected until Season 11.  To summarize: Intro sequence soundtrack for Seasons 4-10: Sinatra is back, but the stamp sound effect is out of sync.  Wow, talk about lazy.

As for the video quality, I'm impressed.  For an average of 13 episodes per disc, these look surprisingly good for standard definition.  Totally watchable.  I don't recall the episodes on the Sony release looking any better than they do here.  I didn't notice any compression issues at all, except for, oddly, a Season 3 disc that had only 11 episodes.  On my Blu-ray player, I noticed some distracting aliasing.  When I played the same disc on my regular DVD player, it looked fine.  The Blu-ray was upscaling the video to 1080p, and the issue was pronounced, whereas it's undetectable in 480p.

As for edits, there are a few reviews here that go into that -- apparently some episodes are cut, which is seriously disappointing, but the general consensus seems to be that this set is marginally superior to the Sony release in that regard.  Also, the reunion special seems to be missing here.",1441756800,16,1796,4.826797385620915

4253237,5,B00432QAKK,"I have been wanting to get this series for my DVD collection as I used to watch it when it originally aired. After years of not seeing it, I happen to catch the mini-marathons TBS plays and it sparked my interest again.

I searched Amazon and other companies for a complete series set and they were price ridiculously. Then I thought I would purchase them individually, but that was also a little bit costly (especially seasons 9-11, 11 being the most ridiculous price). When I saw this set for pre-order with Amazon for $29.99 (original price), I had to put my order in.

I had to wait 2 weeks after it's release because Amazon ran out of the set, but so far it was well worth it. It comes in a big box with artwork and inside is 21 dvds in individually CD sleeves. Each DVD contains either the full or part season (with the other part on another disc) and the menus on the DVD show the box art for the particular season with a ""Play All"" or ""Episode Select"". From reading other reviews, this set includes the Lost Episodes and the ones that were released on their uncut DVDs.

My only complaint is that a mini booklet should be included to give you an episode guide for all the discs or something that wold give a little background to the series. Other than that, it's perfect!

Although the price has gone up, I would definitely recommend this box set to anyone looking to get all 262 episodes and it's a nice set to add to anyone's collection.",1437609600,,1447,4.368029739776952
4253238,5,B00432QAKK,Great show. I ordered it one day before they doubled the price and got it 2 days before the expected delivery date. Will be having a marathon real soon. I remember as a kid watching this show on Sunday nights with In Living Color! I could do without all the yelling when any character would walk into a scene in the later seasons but that's just something that bugs me and doesn't take away from this set.,1437523200,,405,4.2727272727272725

4253241,3,B00432QAKK,"The show is great and deserves more stars, but I'm reviewing the presentation being sold here.
Now when I pre-ordered this set for $30, I was pretty excited. When the supply didn't meet demand, I thought I should buy another set for my buddy before the price went up. Well I waited too long and now it's priced at more than double what I paid.

As has been stated in previous reviews, the packaging consists of one plastic case full of paper sleeves with DVDs and nothing more. The seasons are not clear, and there are zero ""extras"" (most of which I seldom care for anyway).

The video quality as I can tell is fine and I am really enjoying the show. But for $60, I probably wouldn't recommend buying this set. For that kind of money, this is a weak set. For $30, this is fantastic.

So in summary, MWC is a great program and you'll really enjoy (re)watching it. But save your cash until Amazon comes to its senses and reduces the price to a more realistic figure for what they're selling. $40 tops, not $65.
Boycott the Bundys ... for now. The supply/demand curve will settle, and I can get another set for my buddy's wedding present at a realistic price.",1437350400,11,1156,4.392523364485982

I would have preferred to pay more for the quality I expect. I've never seen such a cheap, horribly packaged series set.

4253244,4,B00432QAKK,"Everything is great, nice compact box so it doesn't take up a ton of room, the only thing that was not the best is that the DVDs tend to slide off of their holders because they don't fit the best on the holders.",1437177600,,211,3.9302325581395348
4253245,3,B00432QAKK,"I was excited to see ""Married... With Children"" being re-released, and the promise of a restored opening theme. I was even more excited to read statements from Mill Creek regarding the unedited release of ""It's A Bundyful Life"", and the fact that they had confirmed production details with Sony. Despite their reputation for cheap releases, this suggested that they cared about what fans of the show wanted, and that they were going to put out a quality, complete release. Well, they failed.

Everything about this release reeks of cheapness, and I'm not talking about the packaging, which I think is actually better than the last release. With the exception of the known edits in season 4, this release appears to be a low-bitrate version of everything released before. Despite this criticism, the video quality of this release is actually surprisingly good, even on the most densely-packed disks, where episodes are squeezed in to little more than 500MB each.

Here's the bit that really bugs me, and why I can only give this release a rating of 3. Edits. There are two aspects to this - missing content, and the theme. For me, the issue with previous releases was never the theme itself, but rather the edits which occurred as a result of removing it. The original releases of season 4-11 were modified to remove references to ""Love And Marriage"" from the closing credits. While I saw this as unnecessary, I can understand why it was done. Bizarrely, this release actually removes these references from season 1 and 2 as well, despite the music being restored. What I cannot understand, is why this release has kept those edits, and simply restored the original theme music over the top. Yes, the theme is original, but the credits are not. As a result, this release has sacrificed live action sequences at the end of a number of episodes which could have been easily restored. I cannot comprehend, other than for the sake of complete and utter cheapness, why Mill Creek didn't revert to the original source material for all episodes. Clearly this was available in order to facilitate fixing numerous season 4 edits, and based on their own statements, they were aware of at least some edits that needed fixing in the original release. If they had used the original source material, they could have delivered a complete, original, and definitive release, instead of regurgitating the same old rubbish and perpetuating earlier mistakes.

Based on the edits listed on the Bundyology site, so far I have identified the following edits in this release...

Season 1 - Girls Just Want To Have Fun, Part 1 - Missing lines about finding Kelly's report card.
Season 2 - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun (Part 2) - No licking.
Season 2 - Oldies But Young'Uns - Anna (Go To Him) missing from end credits.
Season 5 - Look Who's Barking - Static credits with BB King.

Season 4 appears to be intact, but not all of the edits are well documented.

Live action sequences from closing credits in seasons 7 and 8 are missing.

Seasons 1, 2, 4-11, omit references to ""Love And Marriage"" from the credits (only seasons 4-11 with the Sony releases).

My recommendation - If you don't own any previous release, buy this one. If you already have an earlier release, and are looking to reduce the number of edits, buy this one (or the combined season 3 & 4 from Mill Creek). If you have the German season 4 DVD set, you're probably pedantic enough to have noticed that is edited too, as well as the image being zoomed in, so again, buy this one. If you've already got an earlier set, and you're not as pedantic as I am when it comes to edits, give this one a miss.",1437091200,191,3636,4.6970172684458396

4253247,5,B00432QAKK,Very good show. If your picking this up or thinking about you know its a good show. The packaging isn't that bad its just a giant DVD case with 21 discs stacked in order with paper sleeves for each disc. Its the same packaging as the Roseanne box set that Mill Creek released. The positive of this set is that the price to get all 262 episodes (including the lost episode wich wasn't included with the prior Sony release) and every episode has the Love & Marriage theme at the beginning unlike previous sets/releases. I only checked the first 2 discs and one of the discs for season 7 to see if it had the theme music but didn't see any special features. As a huge fan of this sitcom I recommend picking it up I grew up whatching the show and its worth the pickup. They sure don't make sitcoms like this anymore.,1436745600,7,812,4.279220779220779
4253248,4,B00432QAKK,"I love the show and the video quality is great. Sure it could be better, but I have seen worst. I think the video quality is as good if not better than what one sees on TV. the reason for the four star review is due to the packaging. With only paper sleeves I had to invest in a bunch of clear disc cases. What makes me disappointed is that there is no episode guide included. Episodes are listed on the disc art.",1436486400,3,413,3.9879518072289155

Never-the-less I'll get it as soon as I can as it is very good value, however I have to give it only four stars as the packaging SHOULD be brighter. 'Married with Children' was one of the better sitcoms of recent times though!.

The packaging leaves a lot to be desired (basically a large dvd case housing 21 discs in paper sleeves), but at this price, I really can't complain. All my discs were in good condition with no scratches.

I should however advise you all that in the episode ""Al loses his cherry"", there is a scene where Kelly is wearing a jacket with a rebel flag patch on her sleeve! This will surely anger this nation of pansies that we live in and I'm positive all future printings will have this episode edited, so grab this set now before it's too late!",1436227200,41,646,4.295081967213115

4253276,5,B00432QAKK,"Married with Children: The Complete Series captures the entire hilarious sitcom that aired from 1987 to 1997 and contains numerous bonus features. No character is spared from barrages of insults, humiliation, bumbling misfortunes and the general dysfunction of all their lives. The humour throughout the series has few limits and crosses most moral and social standards, yet the Bundy family and their friends instantly become addictive and their many faults provide a steady supply of side-splitting scenes.

4253284,2,B00432QAKK,"First of all:

1.  I love ""Married with Children""
2.  I love Amazon, this is not their fault

That said, I ordered this set for my dad for Christmas.  He is an avid ""Married with Children"" fan.  When it came, he opened the packaged and looked puzzled.

After a closer look, I could see why he was puzzled. The company who makes this product apparently believes that the DVDS will be okay in 2 stacks of 16 DVDS each, ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER (!) without any kind of padding between each one.  Also, when dad opened it, the back of the packaging literally fell off, so he had to glue it back together.

This is absolutely incredible to me.  The thing is not inexpensive, to say the least, and THIS is the BEST they can do?  It's like they are saying, ""Yeah, here it is, but what happens to it after you open it is YOUR problem!""  I solved the immediate problem by buying a CD wallet from Amazon to hold the DVDS so they can't get damaged by each other rubbing together.  BUT WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO?  AND, the CD wallet was under $8.00, so this tells me that it would not have cost a fortune for the company to do it right.

Please be aware that if you buy this, you will have to either leave your DVD set quietly in the music cabinet so it can't move around and get scratched, or find another way to ""house"" your set so you can use it.  I never leave reviews quite this gnarly, but I am absolutely amazed at the lack of thought on the manufacturer's part.  I was also very embarrassed giving my father such a unacceptable gift.

All I can say is, I hope the DVDS play, and are not already all scratched up.  Think twice whether or not you want the extra hassle if you buy this extremely poorly packaged set.",1420848000,5,1701,4.146788990825688

For 10 years, the Bundy's were brilliantly tasteless, daringly raunchy and a devilishly clever comedy that pun the ""fun"" in ""dysfunctional"". Now you can own this great collectible box set that's guaranteed to give you hours and hours of domestic bliss along with the fact that ""Married With Children"" was the Fox networks first actual show when Fox became a network in the Spring of 1987, just like NBC, CBS, and ABC all were.",1390780800,,749,5.190082644628099

4253356,4,B00432QAKK,"Married with Children was one of the iconic sitcoms in the late 80s and most of the 90s. It was a total spoof of the feel good sitcoms of the 1980s like The Cosby Show, Facts of Life, Family Ties etc as well as a spoof of shows like All In The Family and The Jefferson's whose main characters were what the character of Al Bundy was definitely based (at least in part) upon. It premiered at a time just before the whole ""political correctness"" phase kicked in, and probably only lasted as long as it did because it came on when Fox was just a fledgeling network.

The show, especially in the early years was totally crass, never took anything all that seriously and made fun of itself along with everything else. The whole concept was a totally over the top dysfunctional family with ""normal"" neighbors. I personally think the best seasons were when David Garrison was a regular on the show, because the character Steve really did a great job of balancing out Al while sometimes secretly wanting to be like him. But all throughout the series the actors had very good chemistry and seemed to have a lot of fun playing the characters which is part of what made the show great. There were tons of great guest stars in cameo roles over the course of the series ranging from Sam Kinison (in the wonderful episode which spoofed It's a Wonderful Life) to Vanna White.

My only real disappointment with the series is that the final season really felt forced. There were some funny episodes in it, but it did not seem all that necessary and gave the show a feeling of hanging on too long. The last episode was really disappointing in that it did not have all the characters in it, did not bring David Garrison back for a cameo and really felt like just another episode. There was no sense of finality to the series that a show that had been on the air that long should have had. I am not sure if the 11th season ended with the possibility of coming back for a 12th which is why they did not end with a proper series finale or if that was just the decision for the final episode, but it really did fall flat.

As far as the set goes. There are two packaging options one that has the individual seasons in their own boxes and another that just has all the discs in two big spindles. Either way the content is the same. In the first few seasons there are some bonus material (mainly the reunion special) then some behind the scenes stuff. After that it is just the episodes themselves. The biggest change from what was broadcast is they lost the rights to use the Love and Marriage theme song in the opening credits of the DVDs after season 2, so from season 3 on they use a canned instrumental opening.

Overall, if you were a fan of the show, even though it probably did hang around a season or two too long, and the limitations of the DVD release it is worth getting. The A/V quality is about what you would expect from a show as old as this one and there could be more extras, but regardless of all that it is probably the best release there will be and it is well worth picking up.",1387929600,,3074,4.313148788927336

I figured out a simple solution to the two stacks of discs. Just take a blank cd or dvd holder and use that to stack the watched dvd's onto it.

Imagine my suprise when I opened the MWC package and found...NO SLEEVES!!!  That's right...they were packed in 2 stacks of 16 discs each with no sleeves or protection of any kind.  I have many box sets and in each of them discs are easily accessible without moving more than one disc.  In this set, if you wanted to play disc 14, you have to remove the 13 discs piled on top of it and hope they do not get damaged if and when you put them down.

So in order to find what DVD you wish to watch, you have to go through the stack of DVD's and they are not packaged in any sleeves so you can really damage the DVD's if you are not carful when handling.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the labeling on the first few seasons is very vague and confusing. They don't specify the order of the disc, so you kind of have to guess which is the next one.

4253426,5,B00432QAKK,"**NOTE: THERE IS A BOX SET THAT CAME OUT IN 2010 WHICH COSTS A LITTLE MORE BUT COMES IN A HIGHER QUALITY BOX/PACAGE; THIS REVIEW TALKS ABOUT THE 2011 VERSION. KEEP THIS IN MIND.**

Since getting into Blu-Rays this is probably the last DVD set I'll ever buy (Since I figured the odds of this ever coming on Blu-ray are almost nil). Frist it must be pointed out that this set is just an amazing value; you get every single episode of the entire show--nearly 6000 hours worth on 32 discs--for a surprisingly low price. But, allow me to talk less about the show itself and focus on what exactly the set contains.

As I am here to present only a fair review I must disclose that right away you will notice how the box set is physically put together cheaply; the discs are all on two spindles, which I have never seen a box set do. It is clearly a cost saving measure, but since they seem to pass those savings on to the consumer there is not much I can complain about there. Also I would like to say to any prospective buyer, the only listing of the episodes and what disc each are on is printed on a paper gluded to the back of the box. Save that paper and you'll thank yourself later.

While the audio and video quality are nothing amazing (due to how it was originally recorded), the DVDs still present the best quality you will ever see the show in. I must disclose, on a less positive note, my one major gripe for me was how some of the later seasons contain the syndicated version of the show (meaning they are shorted by about a minute each); it's not a deal breaker but that is the one thing that has me considering giving this set less than five stars. Lastly it should be noted that there are practically no special features throughout the set--something I personally would have liked to see. (I'm a big sucker for audio commentaries)

Overall if you're a fan, or are shopping for someone who is a fan, jump on this set and I promise you will never regret the purchase. A great show finally collected in one convenient set!
With this set containing 5962 hours of enjoyment (you read that right, 5962 hours), for less the price of a dinner for two how can you possibly go wrong?

As a slight aside; I often find myself buying buy sets and never ever watching them once. It has not in anyway been the case with this set. Just pull up almost any disc randomly, hit play all, and sit back and prepare to be entertained for the next few hours. Don't let the slightly cheap packaging deter you. I really hope you take my word on this and give this amazing set a chance--wether you are already a fan or am trying to introduce the show to someone who's never seen it.

""Whooa Bundy!""

P.S.  As I mentioned up on the very top there is a slightly more expensive set (about 50% more at the time of this review) released in 2010 with identical discs except it is packaged better. I have never seen it in person so I cannot say if worth the extra money. Again, my review is only about the 2011 version. I just want to keep that clear. The decision is yours. I believe the 2011 set is in a physcialy smaller box (taking up less shelf space) if that matters to you but either way both sets contain the exact same discs, so keep that in mind. Whichever set you decide on will be a excelent choice.",1366588800,,3286,4.263242375601926
4253427,5,B00432QAKK,"but I love the show and well the pricing makes the packaging bearable. The box comes with two plastic spindles which hold the dvds, so six seasons share one season and five the other spindle. while this is a great space saver. I do not understand why the spindles are so cheap why not make the tray/spindle a hard plastic? and the slip cover is ok, but not as sturdy as it should be.

now onto the show itself. I lost track of the series during the last few seasons. I did not realize it was on for 11 seasons. and even though fox was screwing around with the schedule I had seen more of these episodes than I thought I did. But watching them straight through and seeing the evolution of the characters worked out great. there are a few featurettes that have interviews with the cast as well as easter eggs that have additional unaired clips from a reunion special. and there is an episode from the third season that wasn't aired (or so it says, but I swear I've seen it before...and in hindsight I wonder why it wasn't shown originally as they had done far more controversial episodes throughout their run.

One thing I did notice (which is the beauty of watching a show season by season...as you can see things you missed when they first aired) is that the show never really jumped the shark, as it pretty much was an over the top production to begin with. the show seemed to relish in its absurdities. There were times when a character fell off the roof and it was obvious it was a dummy, and someone would say, ok we can see that's not a real person, well those people didn't get the joke. the writers invited us into their twisted little world. and they let us in on the jokes, so in some ways the show was a satire of all other family based sitcoms, and on the other hand it was a very unique take on the family sitcom.  The cast was perfect, the writing was spot-on and no matter how absurd it got, you couldn't help but laugh. It never took itself too seriously and it never tried to be something it wasn't. this was blue collar tv, before Rosanne (though many give that show credit for being the one that started the trend, even though Married with Children did it first....and best).

Perhaps fueled by the controversy that surrounded it, the show became rather iconic even if it never was a number one show (fox was just starting out after all). But, I had never heard of a show that had such strong word of mouth and was as identifiable without being a Nielsen powerhouse. Well, not until this show turned up, same as with The Simpsons, everyone knew of the Simpsons and the catchphrases without it being  a number one show either. My favorite part is how when the show started you find Bud playing a believable son to fictional Al (who was a bit of a caricature unto himself, perhaps a character no one else could have played but Ed O'neil) and you kind of saw him as a ""bundy"" and you saw Kelly as what Al could never be (popular, loved and happy) so when the show progressed and it was Kelly who became more like Al, you kind of find it more believable when Al says what his life could have been. The young and beautiful Kelly seemed to have a promising life ahead of her, but in the end you find that life can shatter even the most promising of dreams. She was more like Al than you would have thought. He was popular in high school too. now...he's married with Children.

Katy Segal plays Peggy perfectly. You can see why Al can both love her and be frustrated with her at the same time. Though you really can't understand why he wouldn't want to go to bed with her. as she is a beautiful woman, perhaps too extreme at times. There were times when the writers made her rather unlikable. I guess it helped the story along, but at the same time it made you wonder why Al would have put up with her for so long.

though the details can be rather inconsistent, I don't think it matters, or that they care. Obviously they could not have done anything they did or have what they had if he really didn't make any money as a shoe salesman, and at times the over-exaggeration can be a bit trying, but they somehow managed to make you forget all of that with some great lines. Though I found Peggy wasn't given as many great lines as Al. maybe they needed more female writers I am not sure. But overall the show was great and highly rewatchable.

One last thought, since this show got a lot of bad press about it's dysfunctionaltiy I would like to say that with this show, no matter how over the top they got, no matter how mean they would be to each other at times, when it really got down to it they loved each other. and they always had each other's back. While they might harass each other without a second thought no one else could. They had each other's back. that's something you don't really see in most family oriented shows, or they were more talk than action. In Married with Children you got the sense that even though they seemed like they hated each other when it came right down to it they actually cared about each other. You get the feeling too that the cast got along in real life as well, as the chemistry is strong, and though the supporting characters may seem to despise the bundys you feel as if the actors respected each other. and in the end, I believe that if a show is to be successful you not only need talented actors but you need them to have the right chemistry together. The actors all seem to respect and care for each other (you can see this more when you watch the featurettes) and that comes across In the show, and that's why it's not hard to like this rather strange but relatable family",1366588800,4,5632,4.301602262016965

The $60 one is the one I preferred because the discs are all individually stacked with space in the middle so that they are not free to spin on one another providing protection.

It opens up with 2 spindles on each side with the discs all stacked on each other with a piece of cardboard holding them in place.  It came unglued and pretty much fell apart the day i bought it.

4253463,1,B00432QAKK,"MWC is of course a 5 star show but you need to pay attention to which set you buy.

There is the December 12, 2010 (ASIN: B00432QAKK) which Amazon offers for about $62.00 and there is the September 27, 2011 (ASIN: B005CGI4EG) which Amazon offers for about $32.00

As has been noted by others they are exactly the same discs but the 2010 release has discs in individual cases and is a larger box set and the 2011 release is simply two stacks of DVDs in a box and they are not individually cased.

The problem is when some sellers list the 2011 set with cheaper packaging as the 2010 set and it seems like you are getting a great deal.

For example I just went through that exact problem with Discount Electronics & Games who lists the 2010 box set for only $49.95, this is of course actually the $32.00 but the seller still hasn't changed the listing after being informed.

Also had quite a few problems with that seller (Discount Electronics & Games) trying to get it resolved and eventually had to file a claim against him to get refunded.

So it would probably be a good idea to contact the seller before bidding to verify that they know the difference between the two sets and are selling the one you want. I wish I had done that the first time.

Of course if you are looking for the cheaper set with the simpler packaging (discs are not individually cased) then that is no problem, just buy the $32 box set.",1357948800,14,1411,4.342205323193916

Essentially, the people that produced this made a big box and stuffed all the discs from the individual sets into it. When opening the box, discs easily fall out and there are only two open spaces to keep them where you have to put them one on top of another, which can lead to scratches. It's a hassle to find a specific disc and some (season 2) don't even have a season on the disc itself, so if you accidentally forget the order, you're pretty much out of luck for continuity purposes unless you want to put the disc in just to see what season it is. There's also no manual of any sort to tell you episodes, order, or anything else you may want to know. I've also heard that certain episodes are syndicated, although this was apparently a problem on the individual sets as well.

Although the price is very good for what you get (~$30 for a full series is really great when compared to a lot of others out there), I would recommend getting the individual sets assuming they're the same and as cheap or cheaper.",1356825600,3,1281,4.245901639344262

4253486,5,B00432QAKK,"A classic never dies and they surely don't make them like they use to. This show is case in point. I got this set for a friend, as a Christmas gift. He mentioned he watches some episodes on YouTube, and i thought he would deal better with having the physical DVDs rather then streaming it online. I am a fan of the show and found the price of all eleven seasons in one box set to be unbeatable. Each individual season usually sells for the same price of this entire box set, so there is no need to even do the math. Unfortunately, I got each box set as they were individually released. Anyways, i thought it would be a nice gesture to give him this box set as a Christmas gift. I think he was truly touched and i think someone like him can really appreciate this show for what it is and the sentiment behind the gift. Most people want expensive and lavish gifts. I think this will do just fine. I just love giving the gift of entertainment.

On another note, this show really defined a generation. The cast is amazing, their one-liners and quick witted comebacks are a blast to enjoy no matter what decade one is in. This is a true classic not to be missed. Every family has a bit of dysfunction, but the Bundy's really exemplified their thoughts and let them be personified out LOUD. I do have to admit that since i am a HUGE fan of the show that I personally noticed that season seven is where the `magic' really disappears. Each episode dealt less with fun family issues like excessive phone bills, paying taxes, dealing with a leak in the ceiling, anniversary gifts, or Peggy running to Vegas after selling Al's TV. The family issues in the latter seasons were lacking and i think that contributed to its loss of magic. However, I'd still recommend this show and urge one to pick it up for good, fond memories, or a slice of the eighties.",1355097600,,1842,4.354651162790698

The only down side was the way the Fox Network cancelled the show after all those years. The actors weren't even given the courtesy of a proper sendoff. Ed O'Neil found out the show was cancelled by a couple of honeymooning fans in a hotel parking lot. To his credit, he was decent enough to bring them into the hotel bar and buy them a drink.

The extras could have been more, but since this show was before the time of DVDs and Special Features it is okay.

This is one of the original Fox shows when it started out as a fledgling network back in the late 80s.  It probably would have been cancelled long before reaching the milestone of 11 seasons on any other network, but Married...  kept a loyal following and kept getting renewed.

For those of you who are not familiar with the show, it centers around Al Bundy, his wife Peg, their slutty teenage daughter Kelly and the youngest son Bud.  Al is the quentisential loser shoe salesman who is constantly tormented by life, his family and his neighbors.  This is not a show for young children, as there are constant sexual innuendos and verbal cutdowns.  But for the more mature audience it is funny as hell.

This is the complete series with all 11 seasons as well as some special features (the reunion show and the ""lost episode"" when Fox vetoed a show from its rotation after getting complaints from ""outraged viewers""). The first three seasons has the original Frank Sanatra sung theme than the Muzak version seen on syndication, but the later disks include the Muzak.

There are a LOT of disks here (32!).  They are packaged in an oversized DVD box with two spindles.  There are no protective coverings for the individual disks, since they are in a spindle, so it is very easy to lose track of disks, get them out of order in the spindle, or to scratch them.

The old edition is more bulky and slightly heavier, but the discs don't come one on top of the other. And the 2010 box set doesn't come with an episode sheet like the new one. The discs have the exact same content. So it's up to you to decide which one you get. Amazon.com sells this box set at a higher price, while Amazon Canada sells both sets at roughly the same price.

4253537,4,B00432QAKK,"This box set is truly a dream come true for any MwC fan. 11 seasons, 10 1/2 years, 259 episodes and 3 extras, with a few bonuses early on, all compressed into a whopping 32 disc collection, all under AT LEAST $70, but many of you, like me, probably got it when it was around or less than $40, which makes this all the better.

Let's start with some gripes. It's great that Seasons 1 & 2 retained the original theme song, but horrible that 3-11 got that godawful new song. Really; for all MwC did, it deserved it's defining song. It's the ONLY reason that this isn't 5 stars. Although, there are two easter eggs; for the 3rd episode of the 4th season (Buck Saves The Day), perhaps due to a very nice mistake, the ending of the episode retains the original ending theme. And, though perhaps not truly an easter egg, the 9th episode of the 9th season (No Pot To Pease In) contains a montage of past scenes set to the end theme.

For 11 seasons, Married With Children was basically ""Not The Cosbys"", as creators Leavitt and Moye would put it. The most interesting thing about the series being on for so long is the evolution it underwent. It's actually hard to pinpoint just where things really started to change, though arguably, Season 4, and especially Season 5, could represent the watershed of MwC. Perhaps this has to do with Steve Rhoades leaving and Jefferson D'Arcy entering. (It's interesting, but when I watch the Steve part, I miss Jefferson, and when I watch the Jefferson part, I miss Steve.) The humor is MwC humor; it's hard to describe it as anything else, because they were the trailblazers, and everything thereafter is nothing short of a cheap imitation.
In the course of the series, there were a few plot elements that I never liked at all; these plot devices are present in the early parts of Season 6 & 7. In season 6, Marcy and Peggy got pregnant, due to Katey Sagal being pregnant in real life. (Tragically, Sagal lost the child.) However, for the series, the baby plot is extraordinarily unnerving, and un-MwC altogether. Suddenly, the baby must be given all the attention, in a worshiping sense. Peggy even wants to be a good mom FOR ONCE; if that's so, what about Bud and Kelly, who still get shafted? Very contradictory to Peggy's character. The plot simply never should have existed. Then, in season 7, they introduce the WORST additional character possible; Seven. An annoying little brat, he is JUST PLAIN ANNOYING. The voice, the look... Oh, but he serves an even worse antagonizing role by bringing out the ""good mother"" of Peggy. Yet STILL Bud and Kelly get shafted, EVEN being shoved out in the cold over a simple sneeze. Contradictory to Peggy's character; so much so, it almost broke it. Before, the neglect could be passed off as simple comedic humor; now, she is actually capable of caring for something? So she's not something so unreal she's funny, she's actually an unpleasant person. Suddenly, Seven got fewer and fewer lines, but still no one was happy UNTIL HE WAS GONE. Well, it took them 18 shows to realize that. However, if you can ignore Seven, season 7 has some gems of episodes. As do they all, really. However, the worst season would have to be season 10. There were a few good episodes, but not a lot of striking ones, unlike the others. It was very mediocre, seeming to just drudge along with not a whole lot of funny. Probably because that was the season after the last original creator had left. No matter what, though, even the worst season is just mediocre, which would actually pass off as a decent season for a number of shows. MwC simply set a standard that only it could achieve.
The legacy that Married With Children leaves is that it is one of FOX's many mistakes, arguably it's first big one. By that, I mean FOX cancelled it far too prematurely, or at least without the decency of giving it a final farewell season, or letting it go to 300 episodes. For all it had done in 10 1/2 years, as the final episode is played, you can't help but wonder how much longer it could have gone on, what else the Bundy's and D'Arcy's could have done. It was never given a proper farewell, and truthfully, that was a great disservice done to it, especially since it put FOX on the map. However, let's be honest; there's not a lot that FOX does that isn't a mistake, except of course for MwC, and a few other shows I begrudgingly mention. So ultimately, Married With Children's legacy is that it was FOX's greatest achievement in terms of primetime, a feat it will never accomplish again, as MwC's legacy cast too great a shadow on the network, a haunting reminder of what FOX could have been. Actually, it has cast too great a shadow on TV in general.

For all it's achievements, it has very poor circulation in syndication, either coming on too early, or too sporadically. So this box set is the perfect cure for that, as you'll now be able to enjoy Married With Children as long as you want, at a price that could fit even the Bundy budget.",1323907200,2,4990,4.517699115044247

4253542,4,B00432QAKK,"Just got this in the mail (got it for less than $100 too), and being a big MWC fan, I love it. All the eps are there including the controversial ""her cups runneth over"" that got terry ricolta trying to get the show banned (and ultimately made it more popular) as well as the lost episode ""I'll See You In Court"". All the eps seem to have the extended intro w/out the famous sinatra intro, that I guess was created just for TV to keep it short. It also has a few married w/ children specials on there, including one where the cast talked about their favorite episodes. Though this one was taped while the show was still on the air....the set does not seem to include the later reunion special from 2003.

On the whole this is a great collection only real downside was the odd way they packaged the disks. Since there were a lot of them I guess they just saved a lot on package design/manufacturing by having all the discs lumped together in two deep plastic spools/wells w/ 16 discs on each one. They are in order however it's basically up to you to keep them that way. From what I understand this is different from the other release of this in 2010 just cause they wanted to redo the packaging like this to make it more affordable. (I'm not sure what the other one looks like though) other than that I've heard it's the EXACT SAME CONTENT as the other one.

Anyway to continue.....while they are all lumped together the discs are well marked and the designs are all different depending on what season is on them. Each season is usually 3 discs and the discs will say something like ""Disc 2: The Complete Fifth Season"" in a very obvious/easy to see way. So if you get them mixed up it won't take you long to organize them better.

4253544,3,B00432QAKK,"First I have to say the set is a great idea, the package is fine albeit a little different. I really want to give it 5 stars, however, I couldn't and here is why.

I really believe this version is not an authorized, legal copy. I looked at the content and size of the the disk in the set and compared them to a season one set that was purchased separately. I discovered the complete set DVD were not the same size as the season one disk, however they look the same, say the same and have the same menu options they even play the same videos and extras.

Anyone who know about DVD/Movies will know that a standard DVD-R hold is only 4 gb. a Double layer disk holds 8gb. The Season set disks average size was 6-7 gb (DL disk) this complete series disks, same season and disk are only 4gb. There are programs that will take a standard DVD-DL (that 99% of the production DVDs today) and shrink it to fit on one single layer disk. This appears to be the case aleast in the set I received Direct from Amazon, (Fulfillment by Amazon). Was less the $40 so still debating on returning them.

So many episodes I'll never get around to watching them all. I highly recommend this purchase. I did give it four stars instead of five because of the packageing, but considering your getting it for less than $5.00 a season, its a great deal.",1317427200,3,677,4.338582677165355
4253557,4,B00432QAKK,"I've received my package at this incredible special price. Here are few comments:
A- All 32 discs came stacked as follow: 2 stack of 16 discs each side with 4 openings around the discs that allow you to handle them easily.
B- The discs won't show the episodes printed on them. However, it comes with 1 separated ""SHEET"" listing all 231 episodes, season by season, disc by disc and episode by episode.( Don't lose it).
C- For some reason the Season ""2"" doesn't show ""SEASON TWO"" printed on the discs(3 discs). But, since all the remaining seasons are printed correctly, you'll figure out that the discs that don't show the season number printed on them are actually, SEASON TWO.
D- In conclusion: You can't beat this deal at all. So, as Al Bundy says: ""Let's Rock!"".

4253558,5,B00432QAKK,"There is no way to accurately describe Al Bundy. Al Bundy is everyman and that is something that the writers and producers made come through during the run of this all time classic. To capture all of the episodes in one place is a gift for the fans to say the least. Can anyone not smile the minute Al walks on screen?

Married...With Children will forever be an iconic piece of American television. I don't know that anything that came after it measures up to all that is incorporated within this one show. It is what life is all about.",1317168000,,537,4.37
4253559,4,B00432QAKK,"(Let me start by saying I'd give the SHOW itself a 5/5.. I'd give the boxset/packaging about a 2.5)

I grew up watching this show as a kid (which I probably shouldn't have!) and always found it hilarious. It revolves around a 'dysfunctional' family and their neighbors.
Al, the dad, hates life and works in a womens show store.
Peg, the wife, is about as lazy as they get, spending all day on the couch watching Oprah and eating bon-bons.
Kelly, the 'hot daughter' is about as ditzy as they come.
Bud, the younger brother, is always trying to get with some girl. Any girl.
Buck, the talking dog.

Then there are the neighbors - Marcy ""the chicken"" darcy, who is always trying to fight for some cause (usually against Al), her Husband in the earlier episodes (Steve) or her unemployed boyfriend Jefferson (the later episodes).

The show really seemed ahead of itself, and a lot of the content just wouldn't fly on network TV today (lots of ""Fat lady walked into the shoe store today.."", ""NO MAAM organization"", and other rude jokes that just come off as hilarious! This is also probably a good time to point out that women just hate this show, while most men find it hilarious. This is one to watch without the wife/girlfriend, or you might end up sleeping in the doghouse.

Each episode is pretty much stand-alone and can be watched in any order, as it doesn't follow a storyline. There are a few multi-park episodes (vacation episodes), but for the most part you can pop in any disc/episode and just enjoy it on it's own.

The discs were previously released as 11 individual sets, then compiled into a boxset:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Married-with-Children-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00432QAKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Married...with Children: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;- each of these contains the SAME DISCS -- they're just a repackaging (it's also very obvious, as the disc arts show little continuity.. some will say ""The complete First Season - Disc 1"", others will say ""Disc 2"" (without the season), some will list the episode #s contained on the discs. Overall, this is really only worth noting so that you're aware these discs were NOT remastered at all (they still look/sound good), so if you own the previous releases.. no need to buy this. If you don't own the previous releases, you're not missing anything with this version (some re-issues make changes to the content)

Because these are the same discs as before.. that also means an unwelcome change for many: Starting with Season 3 (and through the end) the ""Love and the marriage"" theme was changed on the DVD release (likely due to a right issue with the song, and not wanting to pay for it any longer). Many find this change to be unforgivable, but it is only the theme song that's affected -- if you skip it, you don't need to worry about it. Season 1 & 2 have the original theme intact.

Each season is spread across 3 discs (with the exception of Season 1, which is 2 discs), bringing a total of 32 discs, 261 episodes, or almost 100 hours of the show!

Extras are lacking throughout the set - Season 1 has a neat reunion special (about 45 minutes, from the early 2000's), getting the whole cast back together. Seasons 2/3 have some easter eggs, but there are really no extras (especially from Season 4 on) - it would have been nice to get a commentary on a few episodes at least.

Video is presented in its original 1.33:1 (fullscreen) - on an HDTV it will have black bars on the side (or will be stretched) - this is normal. Audio also sounds good, but for a TV show from 1987-1997, you can't expect too much.

The big difference in this set, compared to the previous boxset, is how the discs are packaged.

The box looks the same, but is shrunken down to only 3 inches wide -- this is done by removing the discs from their original sets and stacking them onto 2 plastic spindles housed inside of a cardboard foldout. The box itself, and even the foldout, look good - the problem is with the storage itself.
The cardboard foldout is housed inside of a slipcover - once you pull it out, it folds open (showing pictures of Peg and Al), and each of those folds out again (showing pictures of Kelly and Bud), with a set of discs underneath.

This is Sony's new way of packaging these sets (which allows them to keep a lower price). The problem is that the plastic disc holder/spindle has problems: It's a very flimsy plastic material (almost like something you'd expect from a microwavable TV dinner), not even as sturdy as a spindle you'd find with recordable CDs/DVDs).

The package has 2 of these spindles - one for Seasons 1-6 and one for Seasons 7-11. The discs are stacked on top of eachother with no protection from eachother. At the top of each spindle is a piece of plain brown cardboard to hold it in place (and keep them from spilling/rattling around in the case). Not only does this look cheap/bad, the discs get scratched very easily -- opening the box (new) for the first time, about 2/3rds of the discs had bad scuff marks on them. Another issue is the quality control - I checked all 32 discs to make sure I received them all, only to find there were 33 discs (2 ""Season 3 - disc 3s"") - if you purchase this set, definitely check that you receive all 32 discs (an extra isn't bad, but if you're missing a disc or receive 2 of the incorrect discs, it's a big problem).  Because of this, and how the discs are unprotected/arrive damaged, I think this packaging is a very bad idea.
I bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD-Repair-Machine-Kit/dp/B000GX31G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD Repair Machine / Kit</a>&nbsp;from Amazon a while ago, so I can repair these if needed, but most will need to replace the set and hope for the best.

On the back of the box is a glued on piece of paper -- removing this and flipping it over will give a disc-by-disc episode breakdown of the entire series, letting you know episode titles and locations (Season 2, disc 1 - for example). I wish they would've done this differently, as the paper has to be removed from the back (it's glued on backwards, as the back has the UPC/description). A separate insert or even having it printed inside the case would have been much preferred.

In the end, the show is fantastic. The boxset, unfortunately, isnt.. but it comes in at a cheap enough price that it's somewhat forgiveable.

If you don't want to chance it, or want to have real cases, check out the boxset linked above. It is about 50% higher in price, but that's only 20 bucks difference, which may be worth it.",1317081600,10,6631,4.7272727272727275
4253560,5,B00432QAKK,"Just got my complete set of this time-honored series ""Married... with Children"" and I am so excited because this was absolutely my very favorite sitcom of its time.

Here are all the details about this set, also be sure to check out the pictures that I scanned and posted of everything:

This is a 32 disc set of all 11 seasons. These are the exact same discs that came with the previous stand-alone sets. This includes in total 261 episodes, which is roughly 5,900 minutes of video from the series. The runtime of each of the eps ranges from just over 22 minutes to about 24 minutes in total inclusive of the opening and closing credits. All of the eps (with the exception of the ""lost ep"" that remained un-broadcast for years) are arranged in their original broadcast order.

Season 1 is spread out on 2 discs, and the other 10 seasons are spread out onto 3 discs each. Each disc includes a vibrantly color silkscreen picture on it.

These are region 1, single sided discs. The audio is mastered in Dolby digital, the aspect ratio is full screen, 1.33:1 and subtitles are not included although closed captioning is. One more thing that's prudent to mention, these are bona fide DVD video discs, not DVD-R or DVD+R discs that some studios are now starting to use more frequently. Also one more thing to note because this is important to some people, the set was made in the USA.

This is packaged in a large bookcase with a quadruple-sized digipack inside it. The digipack includes 2 large spindles, each with roughly half the series on each side of it.

The discs are held into each of the spindles by cardboard adapters. I mention this because you do not want to lose the cardboard adaptors because the discs are not locked into place on their own. Also be sure to handle them with care so they don't bend or break.

The discs include an average of 6-9 eps per disc (although a handful of the discs have less). All of the discs (with the exception of season 2) are clearly marked with the season number, disc number and many of the discs even include the range of eps from the specific season on them. The only exception is that ""Season 2"" is not marked on the Season 2 discs.

Special features include the cast reunion from 2003 (this was great to see again) with season 1. And some of the other seasons include ""Easter eggs"" which are brief cast commentaries (these are from the same 2003 cast reunion special) hidden on some of the discs. Some of the discs also include ""exclusive Sony previews"", these are more or less just trailers for other stuff that Sony is trying to unload. And finally, included is the infamous ""lost Bundy ep"" ""I'll See You In Court"". For some reason this ep turns up in an edited form, however.

Absent from this set (as well as all other DVD sets of this classic series) is the original unaired pilot (which had a different Bud and a different Kelly) and some of the ""Married... with Children"" network specials throughout the original series run.

An actual episode guide/booklet is not included. However the back of the inlay includes all of the disc contents and episode titles. Although it would have been nice if Sony would have included a booklet, I have purchased other budget sets that didn't even include the inlay so I was glad to see it. But if you're a fan of the series you probably already know what just about every show is about, also you would be reticent not to find an episode guide of ""Married... with Children"" online.

All of the discs include colorful main menus with a screen imposed with episode-specific screen shots for each of the eps on the discs. I have tried out the discs on my Sony blu-ray player and Panasonic blu-ray player, as well as some of my older DVD players and cheapo under the counter kitchen DVD player and all of the discs seem to play fine. There is no skipping and no compatiblity issues withsoever. I should also say that the picture and sound quality is excellent.

Although some of the eps are edited and some of the music is changed I can hardly find anything else to complain about. This is such an awesome series and at this price they're practically giving it away. I say if you have any interest in the series snatch up your copy now because the price could go up or it could sell out.

Some background about the show, which, if you're here you may already know:

The star of the series is Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill, he was the best pick for this role, I cannot imagine anyone else as the iconic Al Bundy). Al is the perpetual, typical husband who just can't catch a break no matter how hard he tries. Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal who was always able to deliver the sharpest cracks) is Al's love-starved wife. Peggy is just as horny as she is lazy. The woman has a serious aversion to work and enjoys passing her time smoking on the couch, watching Oprah and eating bonbons. Bud Bundy (David Faustino, who was also first-rate in all of his Bud incarnations over the years) is Al and Peg's son. Bud is totally the most intelligent person in this family, however he often gets sidetracked if there's a hot chick involved. Kelly (Christina Applegate, who played the hottest and dumbest blonde on TV since Chrissy Snow) is the daughter of the family and such a sweet girl. Kelly has lofty dreams of being a model but first she'll need to master the art of turning a doorknob. Al can often be seen defending his daughter's honor because he wouldn't ever allow anyone to take advantage of his little ""Pumpkin."" As a matter of fact, even though he'd never admit it, Al is just as protective of both Peggy and Bud, too.

I gotta say Ed O'Neill was absolutely perfect. He played the hopeless and harried shoe salesman with such finesse, it truly is a shame he didn't get nominated for an Emmy because he more than deserved it. Ed was always believable, always hysterical and had some of the best facial expressions of any sitcom character in recent memory.

Rounding out this very interesting group of characters is Marcy D'Arcy, you gotta love that name (Amanda Bearse who exceptionally played a character that got more and more ludicrous over the years), and Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley, who has been dubbed ""the patron saint of shark-jumping"") the Bundys' neighbors. Marcy and Al have a very serious hatred for each other. I think this is because both are threatened by each other; Al is a man who isn't afraid to say what he wants and Marcy is a total man-hater.

Jefferson is Marcy's pretty boy second hubby. He's basically the male version of Peggy. Steve Rhoades (David Garrison) was Marcy's first-hubby who dumped her quicker than a dirty towel in a men's room truck stop to become a park ranger. It was wonderful to see David come back to the series for pretty frequent eps over the years. The debate over who was better, Steve or Jefferson will probably go on for years to come. I say, some of the very best eps are with Steve, but I like Jefferson better because he added a unique aspect to the show.

Some of my favorite eps are also some of your favorite eps, I'm sure:

Earth Angel / Season 2 / disc 1 - Bud picks up a hot blonde he meets who doesn't have any place to go. When Al sees her in her slinky nighty he plays the bedroom Bossanova with Peggy all night long. My favorite part is when Peggy comes running down the stairs in the morning to tell Tiffany to stay, forever.

Master The Possibilities / Season 2 / disc 1 - Buck gets a credit card and Al and Peggy go on a spending spree. My favorite part is the very end when Al has to ""work off"" his debt with the hotel by scrubbing some fat woman's back.

Impo-Dent / Season 2 / disc 3 - Steve fakes a sexual dysfunction to get even with Marcy.

The Gypsy Cried / Season 3 / disc 2 - A psychic forewarns Marcy that she is in grave danger, so Marcy decides to bring along Peg and Al on a business trip for good look.

Hot Off The Grill / Season 4 / disc 1 - While planning a labor day picnic Peggy turns on Al. Meanwhile, Kelly mistakenly use the ashes of Marcy's beloved late aunt in the barbecue. My favorite part is Steve's expression when he finds out the burger was cooked with the old lady's ashes, he just smiles and digs right in.

You Better Shop Around (part 1 & 2) / Season 5 / disc 3 - After moving into a grocery store (because Al blacked out the entire neighborhood on the hottest day of the year with his ""Kaiser"" air conditioner) Al and Peggy win a supermarket shopping spree. But they have to compete against Jefferson and Marcy. The Beav even makes a special appearance in the second part.

Route 666 (part 1 & 2) / Season 5 / disc 3 - On a road trip to CA the Bundys get sidetracked in an old mining town. After hearing that there is gold in them there hills Peggy comes up with a cockamamie story claming that Kelly, Bud and Al are desperately sick, asking Marcy to wire money. When Marcy and Jefferson show up instead and learn the truth, soon the Bundys and D'Arcys become gold prospectors.

Throughout the decade+ it was on the airwaves ""Married... with Children"" included a ton of always funny and always in-your-face celebrity guest stars. Some of the best of the best include: Mr. Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, Linda Blair, Charlene Tilton, Vanna White, Jessica Hahn, Robert Englund, Gary Coleman, Sam Kinison and Pat Morita.

The reason why I love this series so much is because it never pretended to be anything than what it was. It never preached to the audience. It never put on airs. No one tried to ""educate"" the viewers. No one tried to give a ""moral"" to the story. And most of all the reason why I consider ""Married... with Children"" to be the defining sitcom of the '80s (and the '90s) is because it never tried to end each show with a ""happy ending"". Nope. They were miserable and they were staying miserable.

Remember, love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.",1317081600,48,9857,4.44296788482835

This review does not cover the show itself, this is a video review talking about the packaging for the most part.  This review shows the box being opened and what's inside.

I rated the box 4 out of 5 due to the bizarre packaging.  However, if it had more normal packaging it would be a five star review due to the show being pretty darned funny, as well as being an EXTREMELY great value.

UPDATE Dec 2011: It appears that sometime in the month of December, Amazon has taken the reviews for both the Sep 2011 release and the Dec 2010 release of Married with Children and merged them together.  This is particularly irritating, as my video review now shows up on the Dec 2010 version, and it has nothing to do with that release.  Please keep in mind this review is specifically for the Sep 2011 version, and NOT the other one.  The review is about the packaging, and given they're RADICALLY different between the two releases, it's annoying that Amazon has merged the two sets of reviews.  Please be sure you're looking at the right one when watching this video.  The two releases are:

A final reminder, the discs themselves are the same, and the content on the discs is the same for the two sets.  The only difference is the packaging, which is quite radically different. Check my video for that.  Tkx.

UPDATE DEC 2014: It appears this $40 set is out of print, and they're releasing the individual seasons all over again.  Shame, as this was a great value.",1317081600,427,2440,6.345454545454546

I am not a MWC devotee that knows all the history of the show the way other reviewers do, but this version does have the original music. The video quality isn't that great, but I guess it could be worse. I am viewing the DVD's on a top of the line Samsung 3-D capable Blu-ray player connected via high speed HDMI to a 50"" Samsung 1080p HDTV. The image from the DVD's is 4:3 and according to the DVD player in my Mac the image is 720X480. In QuickTime it says 720X480 (654X480) with a Data Rate of 9.99 Mbit/sec which isn't much. The audio is great though when I listen to it through my Sennheiser RS-120 wireless headphones. It is listed as AC3 at 48,000 Hz in the Info window of QuickTime. Refer to the screen shots I posted with this review.

The DVD's don't come in a plastic case as most collections do. They come in a box and the discs are in paper sleeves. Two discs per sleeve. One in the front, and one in the back so it's cheap.

I wish they would go back and convert some of these long running shows like Malcolm In the Middle and MWC to HD. That does assume they filmed the shows instead of using video tape. I would love to see these shows they way they were intended to be seen, and I am certain others would too. Hey, they put all the old Batman shows from the 1960's on Blu-ray and they're incredible, so why not these!",1526688000,2,1421,4.144927536231884
