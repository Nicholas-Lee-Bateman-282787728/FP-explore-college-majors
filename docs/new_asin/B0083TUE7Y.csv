5126381,5,B0083TUE7Y,This was by far the best deal I found here on amazon and my girl who is obsessed with the show loved getting all six seasons as a gift,1354492800,,134,3.6551724137931036
5126382,4,B0083TUE7Y,I believe it is a design flaw but each case is small and holds three discs and the part that holds two and rotates on a hinge the hinge was broken in every single case.  However when you consider the discounted price these seasons are a great value and the viewing quality was excellent.,1352937600,,287,4.314814814814815

The disks were all in perfect condition, and arrived on time and well packaged. The show is amazing, progressing steadily from season to season.  It is well written, well paced, and brilliantly acted and directed.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, as long as they do not have a problem with blood (it is about a serial killer after all).",1351382400,,472,4.329545454545454

5126431,5,B0083TUE7Y,"Dexter is just one of those shows that really pull you in. As my husband was talking about it I didn't find it that interesting, until I watched the first episode. It's all about a serial killer but with a twist. He only kills people who deserve it and have done something bad. As I watched season after season I became really invested in the show. I would recommend the series to any mature adult. It's captivating, it has love triangles, and it has mystery. A+",1415318400,,462,4.383720930232558

5126436,5,B0083TUE7Y,"I was amazed how well put together this series was done. When you are brought down to the level and in the mind of a serial killers killer is wild! If someone would of told you twenty years ago you would one day be totally enthralled and take sides with a serial killers motives you would have called that person crazy! I really did not want it to end but like all shows it just does. I was bummed at the ending but it makes you wonder if they will come back with a surprise second series with a new twist. It leaves you with that imagination. Thanks to all the producers, writers, directors, film crews, and everyone else who made this happen and of course the actors who did an epic job making it come alive!",1398470400,,710,4.189781021897811

I am a big time fan .Everything about this series is the best! bluray may bring out the beauty of the stories location but it also brings out the reality of Dexter, and his very vivid solutions to his worlds problems.",1374624000,,371,4.470588235294118
5126456,5,B0083TUE7Y,"If you haven't seen this show, you should definitely take a look at it.  Very well thought out and a very interesting story line.  You get sucked into more and more the more you watch it.",1373932800,,187,4.166666666666667

5126481,5,B0083TUE7Y,"It's Dexter. Nuff said...

I guess not because I need more words required...Great price for Blu Ray and I saw season 7 for $25 here, so get it quick. Sucks season 8 will be the last, but great show. Heard rumors there will be a spin off? Maybe Deb takes over for Dexter after she kills him??? Can't wait for season 8 to start!",1371686400,,326,4.09375
5126482,1,B0083TUE7Y,"Sharing my experience... Received the DVDs from the seller just fine, unfortunately these appear to be illegal / bootleg or ""pirated"" copies of the series. The special features on the DVD-ROM (Computer) portion are missing, the playback quality is very poor with stuttering (worse than VHS), picture aliasing and other artifacts that should not be there, and the DVD format is single layer (cheap manufacturing).

The packaging was sealed, and looked legitimate at first - but with careful research I see they are unauthorized poor quality copies. They even have stickers on the outer package ""As Seen on Showtime"" to make them look legit. I'm now more educated on how far dishonest people are willing to go.

Needless to say I'm very unhappy... and working to get a refund. Not even sure if they seller knew it was illegal copies or not yet. This sucks... what a waste of time and money. Hope this helps prevent someone from making the same mistake... maybe make sure you buy from a reputable seller or store.",1371513600,5,1010,4.832369942196531

5126487,5,B0083TUE7Y,"Terrific ensemble cast headed by Michael C Hall and Jennifer Carpenter who act and interact so beautifully together. Macabre and ghoulish and sometimes very funny, Hall's acting and dead pan voiceovers give life to Dexter Morgan and truly make him America's favorite serial killer. Oh - great guest stars! John Lithgow's performance in Season 4 is hair raising.",1368576000,2,361,5.241379310344827

Wonderful acting throughout the series too.",1365638400,,354,4.268656716417911

I only gave this four stars instead of five because of the quality of the reproduction.  As a couple of other reviewers have pointed out, it's like these are bootlegged DVDs.

I bought this three years ago, put in closet and forgot about it because I was taking care of two sick disabled elderly parents. So I have been binge watching this series. The first blu ray disc of season 4 wouldn't even recognize in my fully updated Sony PS3 player. Finally I ejected it and looked at the back. WTF? All of these were sealed in plastic shrink, but not  all of them have the extra security seal tape usually applied to the top of the case. I can see finger print smears and straight scraped lines on all three discs. I'm furious. I bought this from Amazon direct.
