8163740,5,B000LQQ7NC,"This Korean drama will not disappoint.  I have watched it several times now because I enjoy it so much and it continues to bring me to tears from laughing, sadness, anger and other emotions. It is a heartwarming drama and fills my heart each time I watch the drama. so I find myself viewing it from beginning to end, each and every time. The plot is true to life and one can relate to all the characters and situations. You will be able to find characteristics of someone you know in each character. The actor, Jo Hyun-Jae does an amazing job and is a wonderful actor, along with Han Chae-Young..their chemistry is great. Each actor/actress including the youngest performer will not disappoint you. The English subtitles were quite easy to understand, but you may not need it anyway because the facial expressions and emotions that each actor/actress shows you conveys all you need to know. I plan on purchasing another copy as to be able to view and enjoy it for a long time.",1168992000,13,976,4.609195402298851
