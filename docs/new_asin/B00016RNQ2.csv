8007318,4,B00016RNQ2,"The main plot here is yet another version of the play Pygmalion but that doesn't really hurt this film despite how many times it's been used.  The version of the story in this film is uneven and feels thrown together.  They seem to be unsure of what level of competency their ""professor"" has in making a lady out of his employer's delinquent daughter and some scenes feel like they were added just to create conflict or drama.  What makes this film work is the performances.  Ekin Cheng is good but Vicki Zhao is one of the few that I have seen who makes the slob-to-socialite transformation believable.  Hollywood has always had a hard time making their pre-transformation heroines actually wretched and so there is no real suspense.  Her performance alone makes the film worth watching.  The dvd picture quality is just o.k. but it is widescreen.  However, it was made for older televisions so it ends up being ""window boxed"" on modern sets.  It has English subtitles but no dubbing.",1434931200,,985,4.747058823529412
8007319,1,B00016RNQ2,I personally didn't like this movie. I guess I expected more of Vicki Zhao than this movie delivered. I don't expect anything of Ekin because he's been in so many crappy movies (he probably only picks movies for their paycheck). If you must watch you're better of renting it because I don't think it's worth buying.,1185148800,,315,4.642857142857143
8007320,3,B00016RNQ2,"Ekin Cheng stars as jobless designer. When a job for an image consultant appears in the recruitment center he applies, even though he has no experience. His job? To make a hapless and clueless young heiress, into a lady.
I enjoyed this film, despite the fact that its not especially deep. Cheng was handsome and gracious, the other actors funny and amusing. My problem? I just found it difficult to believe that someone as handsome and well-dressed as Cheng would be so clueless about women's fashion. Dior Cheng not able to dress? Please.
Still, this is a light amusing comedy if that's what you're looking for...Its just not a masterpiece by any means.",1088640000,2,654,4.79646017699115
