8108158,5,B000EBGF3G,"'Utopian Society' is about 6 six students getting together to write a big paper right before the due date. The twist is that they don't like each other but throughout the day, they become great friends. Full of emotion, laughter and it has an amazing cast! It's not one of those cheesy indie films, just a typical group of college students that fight and make up, most are flirting w/ each other. This movie shows that everyone can get along w/ different people. This movie is worth renting/buying!",1144281600,3,498,4.670454545454546

(Director: John P. Aguirre, 97 min, Rating: not rated)
This is a review from the MOVIECHICKS [...]

Six college students have been randomly selected to work together as a group on a class project - writing a paper on how to create a utopian society. Being procrastinators (who isn't in college), they have waited until they have only one night to finish their assignment. Before they can get down to work, they have to get past the fact that they don't like each other, they all cast judgments on each other based on stereotypes, and they can't stop arguing about every topic that comes up. If they can figure out how to work together, they've got it made.

The class roster (in alphabetical order according to the mythical seating chart):
Aaliyah (Kristen Ariza) is the Jock - she plays on the college basketball team and is a dedicated athlete; just don't imply that she doesn't work hard at school.
Caleb (Mat Hostetler) could fit into many categories, but Control Freak seems to suit him best - he's a congressman's son and wants to get down to business and get the project done, and tell everybody how to do their part.
Justin (Austin Nichols) is the Frat Guy - he drinks (a lot), likes watching sports, and is a self-proclaimed player.
Ken (Kelvin Yu) is the Smart Asian - he's on a scholarship and needs a ""C"" on this project in order to stay in school. He's driven to succeed.
Nera (Sam Doumit) is the Flaky Girl - she's a free spirit with an opinion on everything that's she more than willing to share, and a tendency to over-philosophize.
Tanci (Malin Akerman) is the Sorority Girl - she's pretty and knows it, snooty, and is quick to point out she would never want any of the others for friends.

Through one grueling study session that includes a sushi dinner, alcohol consumption, shoplifting, hook-ups, a little one-on-one (and some basketball - of the strip variety), a bit of serious soul-searching, and even less studying, the six manage to learn a few valuable lessons about themselves and each other - to see past the stereotypes and if not exactly be friends when this assignment is over, they at least have taken a step closer to acceptance. If you're thinking at this point, hmm, this has a certain ring of The Breakfast Club Goes To College, you wouldn't be far off. The stereotypes are similar, they pull a ""rebellious"" prank together, they all have problems, and they're not afraid to share them at the drop of a hat - they also stick the ""smart guy who CAN'T fail"" with the final writing of the paper.

They each have secrets that they are pretty willing to share with relative strangers, some are shared in intimate moments that seem natural, but others are blurted out in the group in contrived speeches - when out of the blue, Nera announces her history of sexual abuse (you know somebody has to have this kind of past) just to make a point, it lacks a real impact because you don't believe the moment. It's done solely to give Nera and Ken something to talk about in their paired-off conversation.

The hookups also come awfully quickly, but the one that is most natural, and thus most believable is between Justin and Aaliyah, not because of what they say, but because of the way their characters are given a transformation that leads them to a common ground. They both are natural in their playfulness and their scenes together are fun to watch. Tanci also has a shift in her character's bitter attitude but it comes almost too late in the movie to make her a likeable person.

""This class project is not a total success, but it is entertaining and they basically get the job done. The professor gave them a C+, I'd make my final grade a B- (3.5)""",1143590400,3,3719,4.583458646616541
8108160,5,B000EBGF3G,"Excellent writing, well directed, perfectly acted. Kudos to writer Jason Preston for capturing so expertly the anguish many youths face and deal with as they reach the threshold of maturity. Well done indeed. But don't just take my word for it -- buy yourself a copy of ""The Utopian Society"" and see for yourself.",1141948800,,313,4.814814814814815
8108161,5,B000EBGF3G,"This movie definitely brings back memories of 80s John Hughes movies. Disaffected youth will always suffer angst no matter what decade and this film brings back memories of wanting to get one over on ""the man"". Best thing about this movie is makes you wonder who is ""the man"" these days? The multi-cultural cast really adds an interesting twist to the whole teen angst thing and it's a great trip to be on with these kids as they go through the process of self-discovery. BUT IT!!",1141948800,,480,4.593023255813954
8108162,5,B000EBGF3G,Utopian Society is a nod to the much loved John Hughes movies of the 80's. I really enjoyed this independent feature with its sharp fast paced dialogue and multidimensional characters. I can only assume that I will be seeing more of the fresh faced and talented cast in the future. I highly recommend this movie to anyone searching for a movie that is both funny and poignant but ultimately entertaining.,1141862400,3,404,4.785714285714286
