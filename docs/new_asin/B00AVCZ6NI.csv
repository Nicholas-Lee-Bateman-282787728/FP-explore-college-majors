8558036,5,B00AVCZ6NI,"Not only is this LIVING PROOF that these ""Alien"" entities are, in fact, inter-dimensional DEMONIC principalities and powers, being the same as the Angels of God (Host of Heaven) yet FALLEN out of the grace of God (33.3333...% of Heaven fell with Lucifer--whom did commit the original sin of PRIDE, SELF-WORSHIP, and BLASPHEMY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT--because they, too, sinned against The Father in the exaltation of Lucifer above the Most High--in effect, worshipping an IDOL, and rejecting the SOVEREIGN AND ALMIGHTY WORD of GOD yet being witnesses to the very presence of all HIS GRACE AND MAJESTY, so that they were without excuse) and, in so doing, became these demonic spirits that were sentenced to eternally exist (because all souls and spirits have eternal existence, whether being in Heaven, the Earth, the physical Construct of the Universe (the 2nd heaven), or Hell) outside of the abode of God with no chance of redemption. They are forced to tread to and fro in darkness until the final day of judgment, serving the unseen one--Satan (formerly known as Lucifer, son of the Morning)--in his attempt to thwart God's eternal reign thru Christ Jesus, by seducing and deceiving MANKIND into spiritual darkness and building up his armies of EVIL for the Final Battle of Armageddon.
Satan, though he knows he has already been defeated at the Cross of Christ and is beyond any redemption, is determined to re-write Biblical prophecy outside the realm of time, believing that by turning the hearts of mankind against The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit and also against each other, that he can change his ultimate destiny coming at the END OF TIME, that being  he and his demons being bound in the pit of HELL for 1,000 yrs.
Meanwhile, man dies only once. Though WE (being made in the image and nature of God, in light of His love for us) are also sinners and have been offered the ULTIMATE gift of MERCY in Jesus Christ. It's free and cost us nothing. In fact, when we believe, repent, and accept what he did for us on CALVARY (laying down His perfect, unblemished flesh willingly, in order to receive DEATH for OUR own SINS) so we can enjoy the GIFT of ETERNAL LIFE in the Abode of GOD, in perfect PEACE and GLORY, with HIM for Eternity to Eternity!
Ironically, It is only cowardly PRIDE and SELFISHNESS, the original sins, that can prevent us from receiving this FREE GIFT of Eternal Glory!
Aliens, Evolution, and False gods (Ecumenism) IS THE GREAT DECEPTION! Do NOT buy into these lies. Believe only in the Word of God and LIVE only by the Words of Christ Jesus, The Entire Holy Bible--OT and NT (being that HE IS THE WORD), thru the inspiration and power of the HOLY SPIRIT, and thou shalt be saved!
Trust not in the doctrine of DEVILS!
This is a TRULY IMPORTANT documentary seminar series, and--by keeping a rational, logical, open mind and heart--is quite possibly the most important EVIDENCE PROVING the TRUTH of GOD's WORD and will change your life. The Bible is not just a Book, it's REALITY.",1450828800,,3008,4.729523809523809

8558039,1,B00AVCZ6NI,"I watched this on my TV through Prime. The title caught me. What began as a interesting tale of alien abduction turned into a sermon on how aliens are all demonic in nature and the Name of Jesus Christ can dispel their power over abductees in their grasp. Not what I wanted to spend money on since I was familiar with this argument before. Oh well! I finally joined  MUFON as a result of this video, so that was a plus.",1400716800,,419,4.172839506172839
8558040,1,B00AVCZ6NI,"Warning!: This crapumentary will have you sleeping like a baby in less than 20 minutes.

I rented this because it had a 5 star rating...should have known better and look at how many reviews...Yup, ONE! Probably from the guy that made it.

This piece of junk starts out with the alien abduction phenomena and quickly turns into a religious explanation of what that is and yes you guess it, is demons from hell!  Luckily for mankind we can always rely on Jesus to defend ourselves from these demons.

My suggestion is this: If you're into religion please stop trying to explain things you don't understand with fairy tales. It is OK to say ""I don't know"" trust me no one will judge you, and leave the research to scientists that will gather evidence to find and answer for most of those questions...answers that make sense.

There is way better stuff out there as far as U.F.O. documentaries so save yourself a couple of dollars and skip this one.",1396742400,,945,4.601190476190476

8558042,5,B00AVCZ6NI,"Alien Resistance has sponsored a number of conferences on the UFO phenomena in Roswell, NM in past years.  Their speakers are unique in that they bring solid answers to this venue rather than endless speculations.  Of all the presentations, this is perhaps my favorite.

Joe Jordan is the president of the CE4 Research Group and co-founder of Alien Resistance.  Here is the story of how he came to be involved, though reluctantly, in UFO related investigations and found the truth of what was going on.

But it is far more than his story.  He has dealt with hundreds of cases of alien abduction.  He knows the people and their terrifying experiences at the hands of these abductors.  What separates him from other Ufologist is that he knows how to help them.

The climax of this presentation is dramatic.  Joe brings forth several people who have been abducted and oppressed by these entities.  Among them are some of the members of the Ahrens family that were featured on the A & E channel.  Whereas  A & E gave us the first part of the story, Joe Jordan presents the exciting follow-up.

Those who have been abducted or who are involved in Ufology need to view this dvd and/or the one presented by Alien Resistance's co-founder, Guy Malone,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-Aliens-Demons-Evidences-For-A-Spiritual-View/dp/B00AVCZ4LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are Aliens Demons?
