5043603,5,B006ZPJWBM,"To see Tony interact with each of these talented musicians in a studio setting with such respect and care, and the emotion between them as they performed, was quite special and personal. This is a real keepsake that spans generations of musicians singing his classics with him.",1333065600,,277,4.914893617021277
5043604,5,B006ZPJWBM,just plain the best. how many older artist have the pleasure of the young clammering to sing with you. the voice seems as clear as it was yester year,1332288000,,149,4.172413793103448
5043605,5,B006ZPJWBM,"Yeah,Tony Bennett isn't what he was 20 years ago, but he is still Tony Bennett.  I saw the performance on PBS while in the hospital and it totally made my day. I would rather listen to these songs I can still sing and remember the words to than the unadulterated  Rap Crap Noise passing for music today.  The arrangements and Tony made some of some of his duet singers sound stronger than they actually are. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of ""Lady Gaga""  who is a real talent and I always enjoy Willie and Queen Latifah, Winehouse seems no great loss and I hope Aretha finds the note she is searching for some day. I found the Album worth the price.",1331942400,3,664,4.373983739837398
5043606,5,B006ZPJWBM,"Tony Bennett is an American classic. His collaborations are touching, soulful, and done with taste and refinement. He has his duet partners record in a room with a band without headphones. How many modern artists record in this pure way? It's a revelation to see someone who was there at the inception of the record industry, keeping it honest today.",1331164800,6,350,4.85
5043607,1,B006ZPJWBM,I really resent the type of ad being used to sell this piece of junk. Blocking my whole page and having to come to this page to get rid of it meanwhile interrupting the work I was doing. REMOVE MY EMAIL FROM YOUR AD LIST I DIDN'T LIKE THIS SCHMUCK WHEN HE WAS FRESH AND CURRENT.,1330992000,5,278,3.982142857142857
5043608,4,B006ZPJWBM,"I think the reviewer who does not like Tony because he is 85 and has political views is out of step...review the product, not the individual. If you did not like the individual and feel this way you should not have ppurchased or watched. Your comments are childlike",1330473600,13,265,4.541666666666667
5043609,1,B006ZPJWBM,This guy has lost it  Who wants to listen to an 85 year old sing.  What's worse is that he's become an embarresment.  He seems to come out weekly with a goofy left leaning comment.  If you can't score with the music give it up.  There are too many washed up people out there who turn to left wing comments to score points with the masses to survive.,1329609600,12,349,4.073529411764706
5043610,5,B006ZPJWBM,"Double Grammy winner - Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for ""Duets II"" & Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for ""Body and Soul"" with Amy Winehouse. (I believe this was also the last song Amy Winehouse recorded.) Nobody mailed it in for these performances. Tony flew around the world to record with each artist individually at their studios. They all have so much respect for Tony, and their efforts really come out in each of their recordings. If you love the old standards, you can't miss this. I am so used to hearing these songs done by Sinatra. These are done so well, and tastefully. I can't believe anyone will be disappointed. It played once last month on PBS, I was lucky enough to catch and record it. I've been raving about it ever since. Glad the Grammy voter's agreed with me. It runs about an hour and a half and is well worth it.",1329004800,58,839,4.490196078431373

5043633,5,B006ZPJWBM,I love Tony Bennett and make no bones about it.  He is a timeless classic and he can sing with the best of them including Paul McCartney and Lady Ga Ga.  Tony Bennett is easy listening and his voice works well with a myriad of very talented people.  The man is pure class!  Tony Bennett is to music what Audrey Hepburn was to acting - the epitome of class.  This is a gift that will keep giving and I cannot recommend it highly enough.,1418688000,,435,4.130952380952381

5043641,5,B006ZPJWBM,"You can tell it is a good program when you see it and like it, then like it better each time. Just like the first Duets, this dvd really shows the inner soul of the performers. I keep thinking I have not even seen this performer before, so fresh is it each time. Show stoppers are Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, and Aretha Franklin...their duet had them gutwrenching and producing tears. You can see this samples on You Tube. Duets I ... also love it and play they both a lot. Mom in nursing home really pays attention to this program...",1393718400,,532,4.33

5043643,5,B006ZPJWBM,I love Tony Bennett....have for years.  This DVD of Tony and celebrated singers of this day....was so refreshing and inspiring.  The best of the best.....  The personalities of each and all in the environment of this age blended with the energy and gentility of the Bennett persona..... Showed that the songs linger on despite the brash and trashy projects aimed at our youths of today.  Innocence and romance may continue to touch the hearts of future generations.,1391731200,,465,5.0
5043644,5,B006ZPJWBM,I love Tony Bennett but I wasn't sure of some of his guest-but with musical skill and style these unusual duets work!  It is enlightening to watch the interaction of the musicians.,1391644800,,180,4.625

5043648,5,B006ZPJWBM,Cannot say enough good things about this video.  Well thought out and produced.  The idea his son had of going to other singers to record the duets was a stroke of genius.,1391126400,,171,4.3125
5043649,4,B006ZPJWBM,Worth having. Lots of current day artist duets. Amy Winehouse does one with him not too long before her death so kind of sad but nice they had a opportunity to duet together.,1391040000,,174,4.303030303030303
5043650,5,B006ZPJWBM,Tony introduces a whole new generation of artists and their fans to this fabulous music. I also gained a new appreciation for many young artists whose talent really shined when singing this music such as Lady GaGa and Amy Winehouse.,1390953600,,232,4.825

5043652,4,B006ZPJWBM,"I first caught this program on CBS and loved it. I found it on Amazon and was reluctant at first to buy it based on some reviews. My most favorite numbers included K.D.Lang, Norah Jones, Andrea Bocelli, and, surprisingly, Queen Latifah.  What worked for me was the intimate aspect of studio recording, rather than a grand production in front of an audience. I am debating whether to get Duets I as well...",1389052800,,405,4.625

5043654,5,B006ZPJWBM,Tony Bennett brings out the best in all the people who sing with him.  They all show a great respect for  Mr. Bennett.  I have enjoyed all his duet albums.  He is one singer who really knows what the song is about.  His phrasing is always thoughtfully done.,1387756800,,257,4.270833333333333
5043655,5,B006ZPJWBM,"This is a great gift for the Holidays. The CD came out last yearm, but watching the duos record and making it was great. And with Lady Gaga ,Tony is so Fatherlike when she says she is a tramp on the inside, and he says  ""no your not"".  But in the end it is the talent that counts, and every duet is excellent!",1386720000,,309,3.888888888888889
5043656,5,B006ZPJWBM,"Good for an elderly relative who loves the old Classics but with a twist, because Bennet is singing with more modern stars. It was also interesting to watch for a younger crowd as well.  A good buy.",1386720000,,198,4.351351351351352

magnificent, a delight to watch how Tony works his magic to put the various performers at
ease with his relaxed mannerisms, well worth the purchase, I assure you.",1384128000,,341,4.516129032258065

5043668,5,B006ZPJWBM,"This is second volume of the Bennett duet series and it is fabulous. if you like the songs of the era that this represents you will love the painstaking working the producers did to get this program going by bringing in the fine musicians and production people, the original arrangements and of course, the singers who sing with Tony. Simply wonderful. One of the best things of its kind ever produced.",1377129600,,402,4.676056338028169

5043674,5,B006ZPJWBM,"Woke-up early and put on PBS TV and watched a replay of Tony Bennett's Duet 2, and now after seeing it, I am just about to place my order for the DVD on Amazon. This was recorded in 2011 for Tony's 85th birthday. He is amazing. His voice has aged like a fine wine, it just get's better and better. His energy and his love of fine music is so evident as he performs with today's Pop singers in this outstanding DVD. The respect and love for him just radiates from each performer he duets with and is than redirected back to them by Tony. Really a joy to see.
I am a fanatic jazz fan and catch the scene at many of New York's jazz clubs and really can't take to today's unmemorable music,  but I have gained a new respect for many of the Pop performers featured  in these Duets with Tony. Their performance's of the beautiful standard's selected here, really shows their true talent when they are given lyrics to perform that have true meaning, and their give and take with Tony display's a side of their personality that is a delight to see. Now if some of these performers recognize that there really is a market for the great standards and JAZZ, maybe they can convince today's producers and broadcaster's that their is an audience for this music after all and than start to introduce jazz to today's listeners so they can get to actually develop a taste for it and once exposed to it, get to like and appreciate this great American music before it disappears from the scene all-together. Tony is giving this music a new life and I don't know where and when it will ever get this kind of exposure again after he stops performing. Keep on trucking Tony, you are great music's last chance to reach today's younger music fans.
  LONG LIVE TONY BENNETT!",1371340800,,1750,4.408668730650155

5043677,5,B006ZPJWBM,The guest artists are so varied that you wonder how they will work together.

5043679,5,B006ZPJWBM,"Tony Bennett has always been a marvelous voice in both decades gone by all the way up until today.  However, as wonderfully talented he is, he is also a much flawed person as shown by his limited understanding of patriotism, defense of country and the drug problem in the world.  He has since backtracked from his 2011 public comments that 'American military actions in the Middle East brought 9/11 to America ... ', and he remains steadfast in his mistaken belief that all drugs should be legalized.  Perhaps he has an ageist 'right' to exhibit his ignorance by virtue of having reached the grand old age of 85 (this reviewer is 83 years young!), but I'm not so forgiving of someone who exemplifies the old adage that 'there's no fool as an old fool.""  When deciding whether or not to purchase anything involving Tony Bennett remember: caveat emptor.",1367712000,,851,4.72972972972973

5043706,4,B006ZPJWBM,"I can't call myself a Tony Bennett ""fan"", but over the years I have enjoyed his music.  While Tony isn't in his prime here, he is more than just ""good for his age"".  Seeing and hearing the chemistry between him and his partners on these tracks is worth the price of admission and the respect and admiration of his companions is evident in the music and in the videos.  The bonus with the video is hearing what his partners have to say about their collaborations and their feelings about Tony.

I can't say there are any clunkers here, even though I'm afraid I just can't relate to Amy Winehouse.  And although I am a bit of a Willie Nelson fan, I felt that track was a bit of a walk-through and, while still good, was not as inspired as other tracks.  There were a few moments when I felt Tony's voice didn't quite support the inspiration of the moment, but there were many more moments of brilliant, if sometimes subtle collaboration that are purely inspiring.  He really comes alive, both musically and visually on the track with Lady Gaga.  I'd never paid much attention to Lady Gaga, but this performance definitely got my attention.  Failure to mention the other fine artists and performances on this album should not be taken as a slight.  I don't want to over-analyze; I prefer to savor the experience.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole album and we each now have a couple new artists we would like to listen to some more.

Thank you, Tony.",1354147200,2,1457,4.498098859315589

5043716,3,B006ZPJWBM,"Too much has been written and said about his Duet Albums.
The fact is that, at his age, Mr Bennett cannot make a 'solo' album: his voice is still good but weak and strained, at times.
The BIG idea was the ""DUETS"".
In a duet, the singer/crooner shares the vocal weight and duties with another singer, so the job is easier and, in a sense, it distracts the listener, who is pleased to hear who's who is singing, not really caring too much about the singing quality.
That says it all.
With no offence, Mr Bennet is not able to make it alone, at this point in time.
Like for ""The Voice"", the Duets Albums are for Bennett the lowest point of a twists-and-turns, long albeit admirable discography.
They have to do MORE with the 'discovered' glamour and the commercial side of a career than with excellency of a veteran singer's vocals.
It has been since 2006 that Mr Bennet has not recorded a solo album.
The last one was ""Perfectly Frank"", on which Tony Bennett pays homage to ""the Voice"".
And even before that, there was ""Playin' with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues"", his truly 'first' duet album: the duet partners included ten singers who range from Diana Krall and k.d. lang to Ray Charles, B.B. King, and Kay Starr, and younger pop stars Stevie Wonder, Bonnie Raitt, and Billy Joel. Utterly bland and forgettable were the duets with usual suspects Natalie Cole and Sheryl Crow.
On ""Duers II"", apparently the selection of the partners was a very calculated and commercial one as reported by Boston Globe's James Reed : ""My son (Danny) really checked out who are the very most popular artists at this moment"", Bennett says, reclining on a sofa surrounded by his paintings in his artist studio that overlooks New York's Central Park...""Partly the brainchild of Bennett's son and manager, Danny, the ""Duets"" series is a calculated project that transcends genres and generations. On the new album, Bennett gives a masterclass to pop stars (Lady Gaga, John Mayer), country belters (Carrie Underwood, Faith Hill), popopera singers (Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban), and a Spanish rocker (Alejandro Sanz). Bennett even enlists other icons for memorable collaborations, including Aretha Franklin and Willie Nelson"".
The result, as a whole, is good, not great, from the 'vocal' point of view.
""Now, at 85, Bennett is still singing great. Not quite like he was, of course - who could? - but still pretty amazingly good, even if some of his spot-on vocals might be (but probably aren't) courtesy of his engineer younger son, Dae...
On ""Duets II"", Bennett picks up where he left off on the first Duets album a few years ago by inviting younger talents to share the spotlight with him on some old standards...The charts are pretty good, though they don't rival much of what Bennett did with Ralph Sharon decades ago, or what Nelson Riddle did with Sinatra or even Linda Ronstadt. And the engineering and recording quality are just, well, different than the old days, though Dae Bennett 'pays homage to his father' better than anyone else might be able to"". R Moore
There's no disputing that Mr Benedetto, whose career spans more than six decades, boasts a fine body of work. It's also fair to say that his golden years are now behind him : there's little more dispiriting than the sound of ageing stars frantically chasing after their lost youth.
Which makes it all the more distressing that, after some very distinctive playing ( with his standard group, the Ralph Sharon Trio, Basie or Bill Evans ) he has gone into a very poppish, supercommercial, highly hyped adventure like this CD.
People are not aware, they buy only what they see on TV... As seen on TV!
And right now the very spirited Mr. Bennett is everywhere! Talk show, morning show, evening show, late night show... Grammys, Oscars ! Every day!
And now, voil&agrave; !
At the end of a spectacularly expensive campaign, started 5 years ago, we see the release of a DVD: "" Duets II - The Great Performances"".
Everything has been calculated and programmed till the smallest detail : the duets sessions were filmed by Oscar-winning cinematographer Dion Beebe (""Chicago,"" ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" ""Collateral"")...
There's nothing wrong with that, the DVD is worth watching it once.
Still we are wondering WHY this DVD has not been released along with the album.
