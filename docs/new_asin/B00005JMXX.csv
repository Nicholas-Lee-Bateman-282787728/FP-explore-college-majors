1548388,1,B00005JMXX,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the theater. Although the special effects were very impressive (except for the wolves)it wasn't enough to carry the foolish plot and terrible acting. I am sure everyone saw the ads, and by the money it made in the theater, everyone fell for the hype much like myself. Unrealistic, that word is not quite big enough for this skidmark in movie history. Dennis Quaid is indeed the single worst actor ever to grace the silver screen. His facial expressions and body language are so bad that you will literally break into hysterics whenever he is on. The rest of the acting is definitly garbage, yet is oscar worthy compared to Quaid. Now, the script, what was this dingle thinking? the fact that quaid leaps a crack in the earth and is only able to save his life with a rock hammer, hanging with a rock hammer on a piece of ice with nothing else to grab onto, did i mention the hammer had a plastic handle and he was wearing winter gloves, rediculous. then the rock hammer saves him again later, when he digs it into, hmmm let me think, absolutly nothing, the snow its evidently holding into is being brushed off by flea growlers, yet the hammer holds, and the snow is on top of glass, which, in my expert opinion, would shatter the glass and they would all die. also, its supposed to be so incredibly cold outside, they have to wear all sorts of gear just to stay alive, yet at night, just a plain old fashioned tent is plenty to keep them warm. those are just a few of many impossibilities that exist in this abominable flick. But the main one is that Quaid walks from Pennsylvania to Manhattan in temperatures only seen on the great hole on uranus, colder than the moons of jupiter. come on. i guess you should see this malodorous compost heap, if for nothing else for a laugh. but don't expect anything from it, its absolute balderdash. Buying this movie would be like cupping a greacer and holding it to your own nose, not funny. renting it is like passing wind in an elevator, pretty funny. not bothering with it is like a dutch oven, perfect.",1090886400,4,2090,4.45953002610966

1548570,4,B00005JMXX,"The theory in this movie is scientifically sound.  It may vary well happen, though not as rapidly or as dramatically as shown here.  The North Atlantic Current constantly moves warm water north from the equator and cold water south to the equator.  Then air currents and storms spread the heat across the northern hemisphere.  That current is a massive natural radiator for the northern hemisphere.  The current is maintained by a balance of salt and fresh water.  Theoretically if enough fresh water is dumped in the ocean, say the amount caused be a large chunk of polar ice melting, it could disrupt the current.  If the current shuts down, that heat would no longer flow north.  Ironically global warning could actually trigger an ice age.

Preceding the snow are hurricanes, tsunamis, hail, and tornados.  Both New York and L.A. are devastating by weather they'd never dealt with before.  Then the ocean rise, walls of water wash inland taking out anything, or anyone, in their path.  Then finally the cold comes south, burying the northern hemisphere under massive amount of snow and ice.

The story involves a scientist, Jack Hall, who'd tried to warn the world about this.  Before it started no one listened.  Even during the beginning politicians still bluntly ignored him.  Only when the extreme cold started did the government finally listen - he helped plan massive evacuations and warned people in the path of the storms to stay indoors.  Also shows people who don't stay indoors realizing their mistake and slowly freezing to death.

During all that Jack's teen son Sam was trapped in a library in New York.  He and several others, including the girl he was crushing on - Laura - had to burn anything to survive.  In that case it meant using the books in the library.  Usually book burning involves an attempt to destroy knowledge, information, or thoughts.  In this case it simply meant using the books as kindling.  Even so arguments broke out about which books were valuable and which weren't - which made excellent comic relief.

The end has human society permanently changed.  The citizens of North America, and Northern Europe had been forced to flee south.  They'd become refugees in what they'd once called third world countries.  For so long those people had believed they could consume the world's resources without consequence, and were humbled and defeated by Nature's Power.",1514764800,,2401,4.9523809523809526

1548645,3,B00005JMXX,"The Day After Tomorrow is a disaster movie centered around the life of climatologist Jack Hall when he successfully predicts a massive superstorm, which sets off a series of natural disasters. The cause of this super storm is global warming (big surprise), and triggers the world into eventually spiralling into an ice age. Hall now must make it to New York city in the horrific weather conditions brought on by the storm to take his son and friends to the warmer areas of the South, while encountering a series of obstacles along the way.
The scientific accuracy of the movie has been vigorously criticized by the climatology community. The films first science mishap happens when Jack Hall studies Antarctic Ice cores. These cores allegedly revealed a previously unknown shift in the climate that occurred thousands of years ago. While this may seem like an accurate way to begin a science fiction movie, Antarctic ice cores dating back hundreds of millennia have been extensively studied since the 1960s. This means that scientists would have likely known of such a groundbreaking event taking place much before the date of Halls studies.
Although a scientific error such as this may be forgivable, it is the least of the other blatant inaccuracies brought on by the film. Jack cites the Younger Dryas effect as being the cause of the blizzards, which is a series of dramatic shifts in temperature and glacial activity brought on by the changing of ocean currents. The ocean currents are believed to have changed due to the increasing sea level brought on by the melting of ice caps. While he was accurate regarding how an increased sea level can cause such a chain reaction, it was inaccurate to assume that just because these conditions caused an ice age ten thousand years ago they would cause one again. Climate isn't nearly as predictable as science fiction movies make it out to be.
Another point to make is the speed in which everything happened. In reality it would take years for the sea level to rise enough to create such dangerous global conditions. Also, Jack is predicting outcomes months in advance, which proves nearly impossible, even with todays technology.
Although science fiction movies are not meant to be completely scientifically accurate, it would not have hurt for the director to employ a climatologist for advice. Afterall, a movie that completely relies on climate change for its plot should at least shoot to make it realistic. As far as the human response goes, the citizens in the movie were surprisingly successful at staying safe. Though it would have helped if the government had listened to Jack Hall, as the would have been more prepared for tragedy. However, it did seem like people were taking the storm pretty seriously, and Ill give them credit for that.",1512950400,,2798,4.930084745762712

Every time we have a snow storm, I throw open the shades to watch the snow fall, stick this movie in the DVD/VHS player, and curl up on the couch with some hot chocolate and a blanket, so I can watch both the movie and the snow storm.

1549215,1,B00005JMXX,I cannot believe I paid good money to watch this garbage. This a propaganda piece of junk right out of Hollywood's scrap pile. The supposedly good guys drove these little putt putt cars and the bad guys drove big SUVs. Man made global warming was mentioned 1200 times. We are all going to die!!!!! Dear God!!! Help us all!! We are all doomed!!!!!!!,1485043200,,348,4.5396825396825395
1549216,4,B00005JMXX,"With the rapid development of the ecomomy, the global warming is becoming worse and worse and to date a great many movies have shown up to present the seriousness of it in order to appeal people to protect the environment. Selecting from a variety of disaster films, I choose this movie the day after tomorrow.
What occurred to me first when I heard the name was that it must be concerned with something about the depression and hope. And after I finished the movie, it turned out to be right. As for the hope, which is just the advantage of the movie, we can know more or less the consequence of global warming, such as the enormous tsunami, terrible torna, piles of birds flying to escape the disaster and so on. By those catastrophes, people are likely to reflect their behaviours in critical prospection. Besides, true love is full of the movie, including relationship between father and son, boyfriend and girlfriend. Moreover, the techonlogy adopted in the movie is fantastic, stunning people greatly. Until now, the great disorder and depression stayed steadily in my heart.
Most people may have been scared for a long time after finishing the movie, because of the horrible and unexpected scences. That is the disadvantage I want to illustrate. Exaggerated plots and odd imagination will depress people about the prospect. How should they deal with the situation if it happens? Indeed, the movie seems to present the effect of the global warming, but who can fortell the future correctly? I hope it will not mislead peoples judgement, especially the scientists who researching the global warming.",1484524800,,1604,4.944444444444445

1549261,5,B00005JMXX,"The hero of this film, a paleo climatologist named Jack Hall, discovers that the huge polar ice sheet is melting quickly due to the global warming. The situation will lower ocean temperatures, and then causes a massive climate shift which brings about many natural disasters and eventually a new ice age. Its too late to inform everyone in the nation, and when people realize the situation and try to move to the warmer south, the disaster has arrived. Meanwhile, Jacks son Sam is attending an academic competition with his friends in New York.
As Jacks request, Sam and his friends stay in the library and burn books to get warm. Worrying about his son, Jack and his two partners set out for New York to rescue his son. Overcoming all the difficulties including the death of a partner, Jack finally arrives in New York and finds the library. Gladly finding Sam and his friends are all alive, Jack embraces Sam tightly for a long time. In Mexico, the new President orders search and rescue teams to look for other survivors, having been given hope by the survival of Sam's group.
This is another disaster film, and it deeply shocked my heart again. Although there are countless people die in the disaster, I believe that survivors have learned a lot, and people all over the world will take action to protect our earth. In addition, the relationship between Jack and Sam runs through the whole film. I want to say Jack is a great father, because he does what he promised his son no matter how difficult it is. At the same time, Sam is also a great young man, because he is intelligent, brave and responsible. Both of them set good examples for us. Its a great film, not for its large investment and magnificent scenes, but for what it brings to human beings.",1482278400,,1758,4.601910828025478

1549563,4,B00005JMXX,"I have a feeling that if the events of this movie took place in real life then the Republicans would have to acknowledge the real threat of global warming... ...Or ""climate change"" if you prefer.

This movie is a guilty pleasure movie because it's not bad nor is it particularly good.  It's just a fun disaster movie and it has all the side stories of one: there's a cancer kid (well....they don't specifically say cancer but the kid is bald) and there's the kid of the main character surviving the superstorm in New York.

Emmerich has a knack for lookalikes: Godzilla had Siskel and Ebert and this movie has Dick Cheney. ...the President doesn't look like Bush though.

This is a story of survival.  The weather of the movie is unrealistic and against the laws of physics.  While I do believe that a superstorm is possible but it wouldn't be all over the world.  And like Godzilla it keeps raining.",1473984000,,900,4.5875
1549564,3,B00005JMXX,"This is among the best Bad movies I've ever seen.  While the whole thing is preposterous, somehow the filmaker made it entertaining and engaging. First, there are all the cool ideas for effects. The frozen Statue of Liberty (would never happen as pictured) is haunting.  The ship floating to the steps of the NY Public Library was inspired and amusing (though surely it would have smashed into Madame Tussauds as it meandered down 42nd Street or headed up to Harlem after sailing through Times Square). The symbolism of burning books to survive, or americans fleeing across the border to Mexico was wonderful.

But I spend too much time writing of how implausible this film is. Once I suspended my disbelief (an easy task) I was caught up in the relationships, the effects and expansiveness of the thing. It was incredibly well acted by the supporting cast as well as Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum. As if written especially for me it had the minimum character deaths possible to be considered a proper member of the disaster genre. In short, it did everything I want this kind of movie to do. I give it 4 Poseidon Adventures.",1473724800,,1141,4.752525252525253

If you haven't seen it, it really is a thought-provoking and touching story that will hopefully change your behavior towards our fragile environment.

1549855,5,B00005JMXX,"The film is flawed but still exceptional. The whole subplot with the wolves is so ridiculous, and the plausibility of the ice shelf cracking right at the feet of the scientists in the opening scene is beyond unbelievable. But forget all that. The real story is that we are messing up the climate, and there are going to be consequences (maybe not these, but certainly something). In the coming years, there WILL be huge shifts in population as various regions become uninhabitable by humans. It already happened thousands of years ago in the Sahara. So this story is simply showing one possibility. That's what fiction is, showing possibilities and how people react. What I love about the movie is that while we all know how crappy people can be, this story shows us that sometimes, people do good things. The doctor stays with the sick boy, even at the risk of her own life. People work together. At the end, when against all odds, the group in the library survives, we see something even more incredible--people have survived in tiny groups all throughout the city. I choke up every time I see that scene, and I've watched this movie a dozen times. That's something else which determines whether or not a movie is good, if you can watch it over and over. This may not be a perfect movie, but it's still exceptional.",1467849600,,1317,4.656652360515022
1549856,3,B00005JMXX,"This film follows the paleoclimatologist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quad), and couple of his colleagues in Antarctica. The disaster begins when Larsen Ice Shelf breaks as they are collecting data. He presents this phenomenon to the United Nations, and blames it on the increasing climate change the planet is experiencing, but no one takes him or the potential threats that could unfold after this seriously. However, his claims are backed by Professor Terry in Scotland who has picked up data from buoys in the Atlantic Ocean that show a massive drop in ocean temperature due to the polar ice caps melting, which disrupts the North Atlantic current. This dramatic shift in ocean temperature as well as salinity causes violent and bizarre weather patterns around the world such as Japan having a massive hailstorm, India with snow, and LA experiencing a series of tornados.
This all builds up to three massive storm systems spanning across the northern hemisphere. The eyes of these storms hold temperatures close to -150F, which instantly freezes anythingincluding jet fuel in this movie. These storms affect the entirety of their given continents within days and are projected to last between 7-10 days. An evacuation is ordered of the southern United States, with most of its refugees headed to Mexico, while the northern half is instructed to seek shelter until the storm passes The rest of the movie follows Jack as he seeks to reunite with his son who has found refuge in the New York Public Library.
Although it is believable climate change has a dramatic effect on the planet, the effects would not be experienced within a matter of days. If anything, it would take years to see the impacts depicted in the movie. In this film, we see the ice caps melting and sea level rising at a rapid rate, which is the cause for all the weather anomalies. Many countries experienced weather patterns that were outside their typical climatic norms (Japan with hail, India in snow, and LA with tornadoes), which is also hard to believe. If anything, regions would experience more intensified and severe versions of the weather patterns they already are subjected to. Another aspect of the film that raises questions is the extreme cold associated with the storms. In order for temperature to decrease at such a rapid rate that causes jet fuel to freeze, it would also need to occur over a matter of years, not days let alone seconds. This indicates how the time-scale of the events that occur in the movie are catalyzed and magnified by Hollywood and the resulting weather anomalies are just inaccurate.",1467676800,,2589,4.940366972477064

Global Warming is real and if you've watched Leonardo DiCaprio winning his first Oscar and he believes it's important enough to speak on it during his speech it's a scary serious issue.

However, if you are one that picks apart serious plot holes and very questionable science then stay away as that is all you'll be doing during this movie.  Unless you enjoy doing that too...LOL

This story would have worked better if it was set in a distant future where the weather phenomena portrayed might have a chance of happening.  However, even if it was in the distant future the timeline of events is grossly compressed.  The characters are not fleshed out enough to make you really want to care about them and they have virtually no backstory.",1456963200,2,672,4.566666666666666

1550832,2,B00005JMXX,"This movie is supposed to be entertaining and perhaps informative(?)
Alas there is no credible climate change arguments at all, leaving it to be entertaining only, or does it?
There are 5 black characters in the movie, a kid (Brian) who is over and over told to ""shut up"". A black woman who doesn't speak English. A black homeless thief (of course, who else is a homeless thief in America?) a black scientist who only sleeps on the job. And finally a black cop who leads a whole bunch of good ol folks to certain death.
These all happen in such a subtle way that only a ""man of color"" like myself can feel. However not so subtle when the screen write throws in ""Nietzsche was a schauwinistic pig who was in love with his sister"" oh wait, ""he is not a schauwinistic pig"" but ""he was in love with his sister"". Then of course ONE white guy saves half of the country. Color me surprise.

This movie plays out how it would affect the US in a dramatized way with fictional characters.

1551219,5,B00005JMXX,Loved the movie. Not for the dialogue but the special effects...  Only good thing about the movie is Dennis quaid..  I think he is underrated in Hollywood.. He is great looking and can put two simple compound sentences together without sounding idiotic or aloof...  So in closing. Dennis should have been in the scenes himself and the special effects around his character,1433721600,,371,4.951612903225806

The Day After Tomorrow falls nicely into the first and does so with some interesting and not so far fetched science.

1551362,4,B00005JMXX,"Climate change is such a politically divisive subject in the USA that some people have refused to see THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. That's a shame for disaster movie fans, because that's what this movie is first and foremost--a global disaster movie with lots of cool special effects. It's impossible to watch this 2004 picture just as we watched disaster movies in the 1970s, but this movie does a lot of what those movies did. It moves along at a brisk pace, alternating and sometimes combining scenes of devastation with scenes of human warmth. The climate change in the story is based on some real science and some wild speculation, and it's advisable not to take the celluloid climate change literally as depicted. But the many snow scenes are hauntingly beautiful, especially where the sun reveals frozen people and frozen structures such as an upended ship. As an allegory of a collapsing nation, the movie is quietly disturbing.",1429747200,,930,4.929936305732484

1551566,3,B00005JMXX,"As with the Irwin Allen disaster films of the 70s, there is loads and loads of destruction going on.  But, unlike the aforementioned Allen films who relied on physical effects and great actors, we are handed lots of CGI and a bevy of hackneyed plots-lines, vacuous dialogue, and sub-par performances.  But certainly acting wasn't what we came for, was it?  I'm sure there has to be a handful of die-hard Dennis Quaid fans who have the affinity for seeing everything he stars in (there has to be a few, maybe his mother, s few cousins, someone? anyone?)  (Insert crickets chirping in an empty field).  No.  We came to see global cataclysms, thousands of people dying, out and out destruction on a grand scale.  And we are not disappointed.  How we got to that point hardly matters at all.  Paleoclimatologist (there's a mouthful) Jack Hall (Quaid) is drilling for ice-core samples with his team in Antarctica when the ice breaks apart.  Later on, Jack reveals his findings on Global Warming to the United Nations but is met with derision. Meanwhile, at the Hall Of Justice,..  Buoys in the North Atlantic record huge drops in temperature simultaneously.  Jack's team builds a weather model.  And then the inevitable strikes.  Superstorms!!!!!  One over Canada, Scotland, and Siberia with a chill-factor of -150 degrees.  Armageddon!  But Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is visiting NYC for an academic decathlon and becomes stranded there when the streets flood.  Yadda.  Yadda.  Yadda.  Like I said, we watch for the effects, not for the ridiculous plot.  Overall, this is an entertaining flick based solely on the sheer magnitude of the damage and the seamless CGI that brings us said damage.  This film is breathtaking on that scale.  A fun mindless film on a rainy day or when you're  laying on the couch sick from work and you don't need to think too hard.  Otherwise, there are better end-of-the-world movies out there with much better actors.

I just watched this film again the other day and I still like it. For a  Disaster Movie it keeps the focus on  a few major characters, such as Dennis Quaid the scientist, who has warned about the impending doom but never expected it to happen  in his lifetime, then his wife the Doctor Sela Ward and their son, Jake Gyllenhaal, the College student in NYC for a College Bowl and Jay O. Sanders one of  Quaid's colleagues. Some of the  characters, I don't know their names. The Weather starts acting up in peculiar ways, Japan has lethal hail storms, really Lethal! Los Angeles, Cal  has Twisters ripping apart the City, some scenes are ludicrous, Weather men on the street, just  feet from the Tornadoes, are reporting the news and they end up like Squashed Bugs. Funny in a gruesome way. It starts raining for Days  in New York  City and flooding starts and traffic stops, transportation is at a stand still. The  Water rises so fast, the Oceans are  in turmoil, then  NYC is inundated by a Tidal Wave. Gyllenhaal and friends end up in the NYC Public Library, he reaches his Father  Quaid by phone, who informs him that the Temperature was going to Drop Severely and no one should go outside. During this time, it had snowed and gotten colder and earlier the Streets had become so flooded that a Russian Freighter  floated down the Manhattan Street and  passed the Library, now the water was Frozen  and it Snowed. Gyllenhaal and others went to a room that had not been open for 100 years?! Boy, those Books are Dusty! This room had a big wooden Door and  for some reason had a Sliding Metal Door, the room had a big Fireplace and they had to keep warm, so they started Burning Books like the Volumes of U.S. Tax Law, no don't burn those Books. Dennis Quaid, our rescuer, decides to hike up to NYC and rescue his son, traveling From Washington DC to NYC! Then the severe cold hit and most of the windows were destroyed. When the rescue came with Quaid, this is where the film failed, what happened to the Metal Door to this room and didn't this Room have Big Windows? It was kind of a weak scene.  'Who is that?' one of the students asks. 'My Father' Gyllenhaal says. No energy, no surprises,  Like ''What took you so long?!''  Take a look.",1401840000,,2291,4.446043165467626

1552389,3,B00005JMXX,"I saw this movie in the theater and numerous times on TNT, Syfy and other cable channels.

The Good:  Special Effects especially the flooding of New York.

The bad:  Just about everything else in the movie.  Cliche after cliche  after even more cliches.  I am not saying using one or two cliches cannot be justified, but when you use everyone in the book it just shows poor judgement on the directors part.  Or maybe it was just laziness.  Who knows.  He have an absentee workaholic father, a workaholic doctor mother, a bright but lazy kid and enough pseudoscience to entertain most children.

I only watch the first hour of this movie when it is on cable.  The lead up to the disaster is the best part.  The second half of the movie which is just one big cliche, is a waste of time.  One thing if you think about it, of course you are not supposed to notice these things in a movie, is if the outside temperature dropped to -150c how are the windows in the library still intact when the films show glass breaking in other building?

I enjoyed how the panic spreads through New York and all over the US. I can also relate to the awkwardness and jealousy between Sam and his crush Laura. (Jake Gyllenhall and Emmy Rossum) I like how the movie not only tells the story of one group, it tells the story of many other groups and people as they survive the new ice age. My only flaw is Sam's group in the library. About 2 or 3 people didn't do anything, i could do without them. They're just more names to memorize.

1552659,4,B00005JMXX,"I am, let's be upfront here, a firm believer in human-caused climate change. That being said, this film may not have helped the case in the public eye, as it portrays a vastly unbelievable scenario for the effects of such change. That being said, there's nothing like a good disaster movie where everything goes to hell in increasingly horrifying ways and reaching a fevered pitch so far over the top that the top can just be made out looking down with a telescope from the international space station. Which happens several times in TDAT. Science be damned, logic be damned, restraint be damned, we're destroying the world here! For some reason, that makes for a fun movie, as long as you remember that's the formula.

There is a grain of science at the root of the plot, that the North Atlantic Ocean Current, which is responsible for moderating the climate of the northern hemisphere, is dependent on the balance of temperature and salinity (saltiness) of the waters in the North Atlantic. Mess with the concentrations too much, say, by adding tons of fresh water by melting the polar ice caps, and bad things will probably happen. What is pretty much definitely not going to happen is the onset of an ice age in a week to 10 days. Still, it's fun to watch the collapse of Western Civilization, if for no other reason than to see the standard issue Arrogant Powers That Be get totally humbled.

The acting here is not bad. Dennis Quaid sells his role with his usual determination. Jake Gyllenhaal is passable as an angsty geek with complicated relationships. Sela Ward brings a little compassion into the chaos.

So, BAD SCIENCE!! Bad! No biscuit! Awww, but look how cute you are, destroying the world with retributive justice and ice! Okay, here you go.

But can we now have a real conversation about how we can avoid playing this out in slow motion?",1392422400,,1854,4.695384615384615

I understand that it's ""just a movie"", but it clearly shows how Global Warming can create many different temperature extremes.  Of course those who do not believe in the phenomenon of needing to take care of our planet won't agree with me, and that is OK.

Yep due to global warming and we are due an early ice age. Only Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his local crew can see the truth. The last people to admit it, after the fact, is our illustrious government. So will jacks family freeze along with the neighborhood doggy before the government sees the error of their ways? Or will Jack go to the rescue with his intrepid friends?

We get to watch one mini-disaster after another as the local folk who never listen to the smart brat go out and freeze their tails off. All the kibitzing in the world will not help as they never listen.

1552884,5,B00005JMXX,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" has its moments, and regrettably, not all are exactly stellar. Case in point: Where are Peter's parents? If my child was being treated for cancer I would be at his bedside every day. And yet,during the crisis, neither parent is anywhere to be found.

When Jack Hall and his partners set out for NYC to save his Sam, they end up walking across the glass roof of a shopping. Mind you, the glass roof has the thickness of the windows in your house. Which means the contractor who built the mall is a moron. The glass ceiling should have been at least four to six inches thick to support the weight of snow and ice in winter. Meanwhile, in the effort to save Frank, Jason, who is also not so bright, takes off his gloves and puts his bare hands on the roof's steele supports resulting in cutting his hands.

Meanwhile, back at the library, after being warned by Sam -- admittedly a teenager -- who actually knew what was going on, Office Stupid persuaded dozens of lemmings to go back out into the cold and try to walk to Florida. They had no food. There would be no shelter. But they went. And they paid for it.

1552946,5,B00005JMXX,"I am typically not a Dennis Quaid fan, but I truly enjoyed the father-son dynamics of this movie.

The driven paleoclimatologist (weather scientist) Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) devotes his life to crusading for environmental change while trying to rear a responsible son, Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhall,) with character.

Jake Gyllenhall gives a truly outstanding performance as the understanding, but somewhat neglected son of a brilliant scientist.

Sela Ward plays Quaid's equally driven wife Dr. Lucy Hall.  Although her performance is somewhat small, she is superior. Her character is so well developed that she brings a whole new dynamic to the film--I can relate.

This is a father-son bonding movie at its best.

I especially enjoyed the film's all encompassing global message that we are all connected and actually live on one planet despite our belief to the contrary.  There are so many  heightened consciousness lessons in this film.

Here are just a few:

Money won't save you when the world is in a crisis.
Race is superficial, human is what matters.
Make disaster preparations for your animals.
No one has greater love than to give their life in behalf of their friend.
Environmental friendly is human friendly.
Third-world?  What!

I flipped over the the final speech by the new President/former VP:

""These past few days have left us all with a profound sense of humility in the face of nature's destructive power. For years, we operated under the belief that we could continue consuming our planet's natural resources, without consequence. We were wrong. I was wrong. The fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil is a testament to our changed reality. Not only Americans, but people all around the globe have become guests in the nations we once called 'the third world'. In our time of need they have taken us in and sheltered us, and I am deeply grateful for their hospitality. ... For days now, we have despaired about the fate of the people who are trapped in the North. Today, there is cause for hope. Only a few hours ago, I received word that a small group of people survived in New York City, against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity. I've ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission to bring them home- and to look for more survivors.""

Jack Hall is a US based scientist and studies the behavior of  Nature. He declares in a International Summit held at New Delhi (and New Delhi is having Snow Fall !!! Amazing!!!) that because of Global Warming, the Northern half of the earth will go to Ice Age Again and very few will be able to survive. Only way to avoid it is to spend a huge amount to prepare the mankind against this calamity else all mankind and everything else will go to frozen state (-200 degrees).

President and Vice President refuse to spend this huge amount and let this assessment of the scientist go off that something to this kind may happen.... and 100 years is a too long a period to think about the generations to come....

Jack Hall was wrong in his calculations of 100 years. what he assumed to be going to happen in 100 years is going to happen in few days actually. But by the time Hall realizes it, by the time Government comes to understand that what he predicted is true, by the time Hall could call his son Sam back from New York (Sam is on some competition and expedition with his friends), by the time anybody could realize what is happening......

Temperature starts falling at the rate of 13 degrees per second and things start freezing in Canada, US, Europe, Japan.....
Now starts the fight of Jack Hall to save his son who is stuck in a library with his girl friend, a friend and many other people. Hall decided to reach to New York via road as all flights are cancelled. But near Mexico he has to leave road part as after that there is only snow and nothing else.

And there is a time limit also. Things will reach to Ice Age in next 48 hours... and before that Hall has to reach to Sam and save him......

Great Camera Effects..... and ultimately Hall is able to save his son because of his will power and never dying attitude....
Rest you all to see and judge/ enjoy yourself.

Boiling away all the pretentious finger wagging, the plot is typical disaster movie fare and Dennis Quaid does a decent job holding things together. The special effects are above average and make the movie worth the price of admission.

Plot: Climatologist matches current weather pattern with predicted ice age scenario. Wastes time trying to motivate climate change deniers. Diaster strikes. Government turns to climatologist for advice. Climatologist backhands them a recommendation and sets off to rescue his son. Loses sidekicks along the way. Sela Ward added as window dressing.

Frankly, the audience simply roared in laughter in unison!

1553198,4,B00005JMXX,"Those who love disaster movies will enjoy this flick, since it's about special effects and natural selection in action.  The subplots of the story are a little hoaky (we could have done without Dennis Quaid's wife staying behind with that cancer patient, and possibly the girl who got that infected cut), but in general it's a good time.  In times of disaster one has to stop living normally and survive on instincts left over from caveman times.  Although hard to imagine in this day and age, there are still a few hunter-gatherers in the world (such as the homeless man who joins the stranded in the New York library) who know how to survive when modern people seem to have forgotten it.

Dennis Quaid plays a climatologist who has proposed that something odd is happening.  After a few shelves in Antartica have broken off due to global warming, he proposes that the Earth's climate is about to undergo a drastic change.  Lo and behold, a few days later, while his son Jake Gyllanhaul is in New York City for an academic challenge tournament, it starts to rain out of control.  While the streets are flooded, a motley crew of people retreat to a public library as a tital wave hits and they are stranded (with millions of others in the northern hemisphere) as a cold snap moves in.  Those who tried to get out to escape how deep the snow was going to get freeze to death, and those who found shelter are forced to wait for some kind of rescue.

In a political twist, many find a reverse immigration takes place when suddenly people from the northern hemisphere are crossing the boarders into the southern hemisphere (aka third world countries) to escape the devistation of the north.  In Washington the lobbiests refuse to believe that this strange weather condition is going to cause such a problem until it's too late.  Then the President falls down and the skeptical Vice President is forced into leadership with the new conditions.  And here we are, forced to see a new world without so much as a chance to catch our breath.  A parallel to what we are facing today in the US and Europe as western / American dominance in the world is declining and we are creating a brave new world again.",1370476800,2,2195,4.58312020460358

The premise of the movie is that a huge ice sheet sheared off in Antartica and Dennis Quaids character a Paleoclimatologist does not know that this event will trigger a massive climate shift that will affect the world population.  I have always enjoyed Dennis Quaids acting ability and this is one movie that doesnt lax in that area.  The CGI is incredible with the weather patterns - ice, rain, etc and few other items that I won't disclose if you are thinking about purchasing the movie and haven't seen it all the way through without the trailers.  Overall, Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job in the supporting role as well as Sela Ward.  This movie I beleive would be a good addition to someones movie collection.",1369094400,,907,4.574074074074074

I decided to purchase the movie years later to see if it would be any better on a much larger television with better definition.  While the effects were much nicer than what I recall, the story and acting is still underwhelming.

I tend to enjoy apocalyptic movies because they are fascinating.  This movie IS fascinating to me which is why I gave it a 3/5 stars.  By no means is this a terrible movie but it was average in everything.  Nothing really stood out to me other than how the ice seemed to have a mind of its own at times and was always attempting to kill everything in its path.

Overall, a decent movie and something to watch when you want to see the end of the world but I would never deliberately go out of my way to watch this movie again and again.  Watch it once or twice and you are good to go.",1368748800,,902,4.14367816091954

There is even a bit of political correctness to remind the audience of which Party they should have voted for to avoid all these trouble (though. since there the message is covert. nobody should get steamed up.

Something that is supposed to happen in thousands of years, happens in a couple days, with Jack and Sam Hall caught in the middle. While one is trapped in hard hit New York City, the other must track across the country to save him. Okay, it's a little cheesy and the acting isn't the best, but the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. I like that it's based on fact and a look into a possible future, well beyond my lifetime and overall it was extremely entertaining.

1553497,4,B00005JMXX,"Though this film was made in 2004 and too few people realized the implications of Writer/Director Roland Emmerich's sci-fi fantasy as being in many ways a call to attention of the ignoring of the global climate due to our interference with the natural aspects of this planet, watching it again in 2013, with the backlashes of the hideous hurricanes and ice storms and the tsunamis and the drought and the hottest year on record being 2012, hopefully will provide a bit more serious look at the concept THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW offers. Yes, it is exaggerated for impact and the visual effects tend to take over the personal stories that lie so closely under the surface, but watch it and think.  This is where we likely are headed - or something very like it.

Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a Paleoclimatologist stationed in the Antarctica where he finds that a sheet of ice the size of Rhode Island has sheared off. `Our climate is fragile. At the rate we're polluting the environment and burning fossil fuels, the ice caps will soon disappear.' Concurrently the planet is witnessing severe weather changes - and Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York with friend Laura (Emmy Rossum) and others when enduring an endless rainstorm they witness a massive tidal wave in addition to freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them.  In the background is Sam's physician mother (Sela Ward) who brings a sense of personal agony to the realization that the world is heading for a next Ice Age. From there the story is a matter of Jack's swearing to save his son trapped in the Library in New York and warning the President (Perry Blake) to take his head out of the sand and realize that the extermination of the human race is possible if evacuations South are not begun. How it ends is predictable and makes the film too shallow, but the message is strong and one we must all heed.

The special effects are extraordinarily fine and the cast delivers the sub-stories with skill. Yes, it can be viewed as corny and overblown and a bit on the sanguine side, but the point of the film is well worth our serious attention. Just reflect on the events of the past year and the few years before that and try to deny that we are indeed harming our environment and future.

1553499,5,B00005JMXX,"I am aware that this review will make me sound like a hippie but oh well. I love this movie so much because it shows a lot about human nature and it's reaction to disregard something that it deems as unnecessary, like the knowledge that (in this movie) Greenhouse gases escaping the Antarctic icecaps, caused the pre-historic world to go into an ice age to re-correct nature's imbalance and unless something is done LONG-term wise, it will likely happen again. And in this movie it certainly does. It's kind of chilling to watch this movie because there are certain items that we are facing ourselves, like the depletion of the ozone layer and a record high of greenhouse gases ever accounted for and a very strange weather pattern seen across the world. Art imitates life, so to an extent from watching the movie and knowing about things happening in reality that are main focal points for the movie, it's scary and hopefully art won't imitate life or vis versa.",1357171200,,963,4.704142011834319

That said, I must say that I avoid recent disaster films because they follow too many characters which leads to thinly drawn, cartoonish lampooning of the science fiction genre. Some reviewers find the dialogue trite in this offering, I do not care in this instance. As tired as the plot is, it is an unforgettable, suspenseful ride to bring a dire warning to those leaders who are slow to act. The special effects are awesome and do much to notch up the fright factor. In between the juvenile pining and romantic tugs at the heart, courage, stoicism, competence and ingenuity have their moments. Because the director's heart and intelligence finds a way to warn us and prepare us for a hopeful way out in the end, this ""Day After"" delivers a Superman punch to our value system with no sugar-coating.

I watched - or tried to watch anyway - this big budget piece of environmentalist propaganda because it had reached the ""everyone has seen it but me"" kind of critical mass so that I was compelled to see it just so I can say I had.

I loved the opening scene when the driller guy is standing there while a huge crack formes in an ice shelf and ends up separating him from his colleagues.  This was just like an ""Ice Age"" movie, but with a human and his ice cores rather than a squirrel and an acorn.  But it was downhill from there on.  The problem wasn't that I'm a bit skeptical of the whole global warming thing (at least the part where humans did it and humans can fix it) but rather that I found the characters so dull.

But anyway, the special effects were awesome! All that water comming into New York all at once. And the ship that floats down flooded city streets. Some of the plot is based on fact. There are bouies in the ocean that measure currents, ocean temps. & a lot of other stuff. Scientists do drill for those I cores they show at the beginning of the movie. But I doubt whether a person with an arm load of ice core containers could make the jump Queid does. I'm currently reading a book about the little ice age that ended in the 1800's & that book nrings out a warming trend that caused the NAO  to go haywire & cause the little ice age. So..... That's what movies often do, they excite us & cause us to take note of things around us. Maybe enough interest will develop to do something.",1342224000,3,919,4.251428571428572

1553697,3,B00005JMXX,"Hey guess what, people? It is now okay to make fun of the Bush administration. For some strange reason, right after 9/11 the mainstream media got it into their heads that if they continue to bash Bush the way they did before 9/11, that the general populace would claw their eyes out or something. But with Day After Tomorrow's (henceforth Tomorrow) skewering of Dubya and Cheney, Hollywood has deemed it acceptable to mock the current administration.

Not only that, there are several reasons to be happy about Roland Emmerich's latest flick. First off, it's better than both Godzilla and the Patriot.

Finally, here's a summer blockbuster that is directed by a man who knows how to use special effects. The visual effects here are the best I have see in a long time. I really believed that the characters were in those CGI enhanced situations.
Although the trailer made it look like pure silliness, Tomorrow did a surprisingly good job of making the scenario look somewhat plausible. At least until after I left the theater and had more time to think about it. Even the two guys running away from ice chasing them played out a lot better than it looked like from the footage I had seen on T.V. It is this plausibility and a true feeling of genuine curiosity about how the world would react to such an event that puts the movie above crap like The Core and Waterworld. We don't see a total collapse of government. In fact it is quite obvious that Emmerich believes that society would be able to adapt to a new ice age in the long run. For the most part the movie is optimistic.

This movie could be the big break for Jake Gyllenhaal. He certainly has the talent. Although, this is not what one would call an actor's movie. The script is too shallow and there really isn't anything noteworthy about the characters, although the actors do an effective enough job at gaining our sympathy so that those white knuckle action scenes are actually exciting.

On one final note, it is interesting that this is the first movie in a long time to be directed by Roland Emmerich that has nothing to do with Dean Devlin. I'm really interested to know what's up with that. Did they have a falling out or something?",1339027200,2,2199,4.587786259541985

1553700,3,B00005JMXX,"OK, so this movie has received mixed reviews, for good reason.  Roland Emmerich is not a scientist, he's a filmmaker known for big-budget CGI special-effects.  So if you're willing to suspend disbelief on the actual science described in the movie, and if dialog that's full of cliches is not a stumbling block for you, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

What I liked:  Some found the beginning of this movie, as the environmental disasters slowly build to a crisis, tedious.  I thought they helped build the suspense and lent some credibility.  Special effects were cool-- my favorite was the Russian ship frozen in place on the streets of NYC.  Lots of suspense.  I enjoyed the scenes of teens being cooped up in NY Public Library, burning rare books to stay warm.  And, although I'm not a Greenpeace nut, I found some of the environmental scenarios thought-provoking (would global warming really cause LA to be destroyed by tornadoes?).

What I didn't like:  A lot of the science, if taken literally, was a stretch at best.  If some of these changes ever happened, it would probably be over hundreds of years.  IF they happened.  The movie's somewhat alarmist bias was pretty obvious.  And some of the plot elements you have to take with a huge grain of salt (First, the famous scientist finally convinces the skeptical govt. that the world is actually ending.  THEN, they all think it's OK to let the only guy who knows what's going on trundle off in the blizzard, on a wild-goose chase, cut off from communications while he's trying to find his son in frozen NYC?  Probably not.)

But if you can overlook these breaks from reality, the movie itself, and the over-the-top disaster scenes it depicts are pretty entertaining, at least I thought so.  (Spoiler alert) If we did all have to go south to Mexico, as sort of a reverse wave of illegal immigration, I wonder if Mexico would actually let us in?",1336435200,,1903,4.746951219512195

He spends most of the film trying to get her. Jake's character has a good relationship with his parents.

The acting is pretty good, the direction is great, the special effects are very impressive and overall this makes for a top apocalyptic film with a modern theme.

While some of the science is plausable [it's actually happening already, though at a much slower rate], I can't speak on the more technical quotes in the film.

Main characters are developed, most especially that of star Dennis Quaid, while others are considerably less so. But that doesn't deter from it, as the adult actors all do an exceptional job with their parts. This is helped by good writing. Movies like these are usually full of cliches, trite one-liners, and tongue-in-cheek acting, but here it's believable.

The film also brings up some interesting social issues, such as fleeing US citizens crashing the southern border into Mexico (usually cut, when on TV) and 'what does each person value most' scenarios.  There's more, but I don't want to spoil it for you. It's all certainly thought provoking.

This movie has been attacked because, among other things, the events happen too quickly to represent reality accurately. Well, after some investigation into the subject, I learned that this scenario is probably exactly what happened at the beginning of the last Ice Age over 20,000 years ago.

This was referenced briefly in the scene in the Museum of Natural History when the staring characters were shocked to learn that the Woolly Mammoth displayed was found with fresh food in it's mouth and stomach (true story re: NY Museum of Natural History)indicating that it had been frozen solid in a matter of minutes or even seconds.

The movie is based on the book: ""The Coming Super Storm"" by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber (recommended reading).

I recommend to ignore the ""naysayers"" and look at the Science implied with fresh eyes and open mind.

This was my number #2 bad movie of all time until I rented a wacky space drama with NO movie stars at the Red Box machine, and the previous renter even wrote ""This is the worst movie ever"" right on the disc, it was. Day After Tomorrow(DaT) gets knocked down to a tie with Armageddon as the third worst ever. Without really good actors here, I guarantee you that no one would ever have given Day After Tomorrow more than one star. It has ONLY special effects, 5.1 sound, and NO plot. If you call it a popcorn movie, I call it a comedy. Reviewers and fans hate giving movies bad reviews that have good actors being caught in bad movies, because they have done good or great movies. Quaid and Jake have done entertaining movies. Get a nice pillow and hopefully you will awake for the slam bang finish. Oh, wait, there isn't one.

The number three worst ever, I'm watching it right now on tv, until something better falls on my head, Day After Tomorrow. Fun scenes of diaster in 5.1 sound, but is hard to watch when your head is shaking side to side. You ask, what is worse than DaT, The Core. Same scenario, great actors doing scenes that you couldn't dream up in a million years. In fact, you can't give any movie a ""NO STARS"" review at Amazon, and Day After Tomorrow deserves it too.

But this is really something we would never see in our life time, as he says in the beginning of the film.

Much like a made for TV movie it plays out the same, and the actors pretty much just run through the motions of reading there lines. As usual, like Independence Day no one really believes whats going on, and the politicians are all scarmbling to figure out what they should do about the crisis. Been there done that. Well since this movie came out in 2004 we have had a few more similar movies, but nothing special, The Core i felt was actually more original, but much less plausible than this film. And the acting was also a lot better. Onto the effects, well on blue ray they look well, clearer, and sharper. I wouldnt put them up there with a film like 2012, War Of The Worlds, or even Twister for that matter which was made back in 1996, but they are good for what they are. Debri looks good, and most of the weather looks pretty convincing, but probably the worst part of the film is the water, most of the flooding doesnt look that realistic, as it consumes Manhattan Island and the Statue Of Liberty as well, this has been done a lot of times, this being the worst. The tornadoes look pretty tv-ish when they hit L.A, except for certain parts when they hit building, as i said the after math and things flying through the air look pretty good. I would say the high light of the film is at the end when the Statue Of Liberties arm and torch are sticking up out of the snow, and most of the city is buried in it. So all in all The Day After Tomorrow(which spawned The Weather Channels) It could Happen Tomorrow doesnt really leave a good or bad taste in your mouth after viewing it, its just kind of there, so basically you watch it, say enh not bad, and move on to something else. A decent C+ or a disaster movie sure to rip through the late night features on TV, which the movie looks more like its made for anyway.

1554099,5,B00005JMXX,"A surprisingly effective mainstream disaster film in the mould of some well-loved classics (Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, etc) which doesn't stray far from the tried and tested formula but does nevertheless manage to feel inventive and modern...  A good disaster film humanizes a tragedy by focusing on a small but disparate group of characters who are imperilled, and to whom we are required to form some sort of emotional attachment. When the disaster is on a relatively small scale (people trapped in burning tower, or upturned boat) this is easy enough, but as Emmerich seems to specialise in global destruction, it can be a more difficult formula to pull off. Independence Day struggled to present the viewer with anything very much to care about, with a motley assortment of two dimensional characters who never really had a chance to rise above the ridiculous plot and relentless action.  TDAT is definitely more adult in its approach. It has a ""message"" and if the science has been 'tweaked' a little to suit a two hour film, then so be it. (Let's face it, watching a film which realistically depicts the scale of climate change would not be high on anyone's list of fun nights out.) I think he does a good job of dramatising the issues in a manner which does not seriously undermine the film's green credentials.  This is helped by using the great Ian Holm to lend gravitas to some of the sciency stuff. It's a shame that Adrian Lester, one of the UK's finest actors, wasn't given a meatier role, but it's still refreshing to see a depiction of working climatologists which doesn't stereotype them as nerdy scientists with no inner life. It's also a film which at least pays lip service to there being life outside the US, with a number of scenes in Europe, and the aforementioned British actors talking about Manchester United in their Scottish hidey-hole.  Which brings us back to the imperilled characters who inhabit the core of the film. For every scene in which nature wreaks havoc on a sizeable chunk of the earth (and credit due here for some truly outstanding special effects), there should be an emotional counterpoint. Dennis Quaid gives a very solid, charismatic performance as the father who mounts a polar-style expedition along the Eastern coast to reach his son. It's an interesting comparison with the Jeff Goldblum role from ID4 (also playing the ""scientist who wasn't listened to and whose focus now is to save his family"") and really points up the more fully fleshed out character in this film, and also the better performance. The scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal trapped in the library are also watchable, sprinkled with enough clever moments amongst the ""as if?!"" clichs to keep one's interest. The amusing debate over which books to burn between the bespectacled liberal and the female student (""Nietzsche?! Not Nietzsche!"") was just the sort of quirky scene which elevated the film above predictable schlock.  Some of the minor characters didn't do it for me - the hobo, who I guess was some sort of cypher for the less materialistic lifestyle we should be aspiring to (the simple life of the non-consumer ultimately rewarded with survival) and the dying boy patient (a little unnecessary when a whole hemisphere was about to be obliterated) both would have been more at home in Independence Day. The arrogance and ignorance of the vice president seemed very plausible, and his conversion-by-fire (or ice in this case) to accept the damage being done to the planet made for a dramatic large-scale conclusion to accompany the reconciliation of Quaid and son.  The odd scene here and there veered into cheesy action flick territory. There was, as someone else has pointed out here, really no need for the ""Jurassic Park with wolves"" scene. And the ""chased along street by lethal icy wind"" scene into which it segued struck me as being risible. Quick! Close the door, before the nasty weather kills you... But none of this detracted from the enjoyment.  Perhaps the most impressive achievement of TDAT is this it really did leave me with some memorable images - the ship stranded in the snow halfway up fifth avenue (or wherever it was), the icicles hanging down from the statue of liberty, the wall of water approaching manhattan, even some of the views of earth from space.  In summary (no pun intended), better than expected and therefore pretty good.",1253404800,3,4388,4.904312668463612

1554168,4,B00005JMXX,"Day After Tomorrow / B00005JMXX

Although disaster movies are often as a consequence of their very nature somewhat corny and soft-science-y, ""Day after Tomorrow"" can definitely be called the pageant queen of the disaster movie genre. Though the science is soft, the movie at least admits that what is happening is completely off the charts for expected (i.e. 'realistic') behavior, which is more than most movies are willing to admit (see,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Core/dp/B0000AKCKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Core</a>). And though the usual cast of disaster movie characters are present, including the ubiquitous Unreliable Dad Who Comes Through In The End, I was beyond pleased to note that the movie didn't belabor the characters by beating the particularly dead horse of disaster movie character tropes and, instead, just continued firmly on to the action. As such, we are spared all the ""This is why we are divorced/separated/whiny!"" dialogue between the Unreliable Dad and Sainted Mother as well as the reconciliatory ""This is why we fell in love!"" crap that is so often tagged onto the end of these sorts of movies. That consideration alone is worth a couple of stars.

No, ""Day After Tomorrow"" is all about the special effects and action, and is *not* about character development, dialogue, or anything else except swiftly and efficiently killing off the majority of Earth's population. If that's what you watch disaster movies for, like I do, then prepare to be delighted. If, however, you want a lot of yammering dialogue to break up the scenes of everyone being slaughtered by expensive CGI effects, you'll be disappointed in ""Day After Tomorrow"" and will have to go back and re-watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>.

I really can't think of anything I didn't like about ""Day After Tomorrow"". The vice president is a realistically callous evil jerk without ever going overboard into pure stupid, there are several cutely humorous scenes that the movie wisely chooses not to belabor too much (including illegal immigration in the opposite direction than usual, and burning tax law books instead of philosophy ones), and the soft science is interesting to watch unfold. The protagonist kids aren't quite as smart as I'd like them to be, but compared to the usual disaster movie crew, they're pure geniuses. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Day After Tomorrow"" because the characters are so smart (relative to the genre) that even when they do dumb things (like trek to an unknown library to rescue a single kid), they at least do these dumb disaster movie tasks in a smart way. And I appreciate that.

I am tempted to give ""Day After Tomorrow"" five stars, but even the best of disaster movies is still a disaster movie at its heart. There isn't a lot of high drama or deep thoughts to take away from this (well, except ""Global Warming is Bad"", but surely we know this by now). So, instead, I'll justify giving it 'only' four stars on the grounds that I thought the ending was way too optimistic about humanity's chances and I would have preferred the movie go whole-hog and say that there was really no hope to recover and rebuild, an ending that Hollywood just doesn't seem brave enough to make.

1554169,4,B00005JMXX,"Overall, this is a fun film.  I realize that the politics of global warming get people going on both sides, but viewed strictly as an action/sci-fi film, I found it very entertaining.  Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite serviceable in the leads, and Emmy Rossum is cute as a button (why hasn't she had a more successful career?).  There are a few story glitches:  [SPOILER ALERT] At one point, we are told that Texas and the Southwest U.S. are spared from the devastating ice and snow.  Why, then, are people shown streaming over the Rio Grande (during perfectly fine weather!) and why does the U.S. president end up in Mexico City (instead of, say, Houston)?  Also, with all the attention on Dennis Quaid making it back to New York to rescue Jake, what about the families of the other people trapped in the library?  None of Jake's friends seem the least concerned about the fates of their parents or siblings.  The especial effects are good, with the exception of the wolves on the ship, who seem too obviously cgi.

The Blu-Ray transfer is ok, but not great.  Some scenes are very crisp, but many seem at about good DVD level.  Like other reviewers, I also had some trouble with the sound, with some of the dialog being a little difficult to make out.  There are no extras beyond a few deleted scenes.  The most interesting deleted (or alternate) scene involves the wolves chasing Jake all the way back to the room in the library with the fireplace.  That the wolves were dropped from the release print is another indication that the cgi on them just didn't work out.

All in all, a decent flick, particularly if you get it, as I did, as part of Amazon's combo with the Terminator and I, Robot.",1246579200,2,1705,4.5625
1554170,4,B00005JMXX,"This review has two parts 1) About the movie (the story) and 2) about the Blu-ray DVD.  I own both the standard DVD and the Blu-ray of this movie.  My review is of the Blu-ray version.

First - this movie is entertainment, with an overtone that Global Warming is happening and it could impact us in big ways.  It doesn't point fingers, so please don't get bogged down in associating this with the Global Warming debates.  Global Warming is just the catalyst for this highly entertaining action movie.  If want to hold the film to scientific exactness, then you won't like it - but then you probably won't like many movies other than documentaries anyway.  This is just entertainment, and it's great at that.  If you enjoy movies like Twister or Independence Day, then you should like this movie as well.

Second - the Blu-ray version of the movie is pretty well done.  It adds clarity Blu-ray movies should have, but there are still scenes that don't have the sharpness you would expect.  I assume the source was just not high enough quality in some scenes to allow for a Blu-ray resolution output.  Some scenes were still as grainy as the DVD version.  This is why I only give this movie 4 stars.  Still, overall I feel satisfied with the improvement.

For those that have good sound systems as part of their home theater setup, you'll REALLY like how the Blu-ray version makes you feel you are part the action.  The Lossless Audio (DTS HD 5.1 Master Lossless Audio) really makes the sound rock, and allowed me to feel immersed in the story.  Got the neighbors interested in Blu-ray as well!

The video quality of the Blu-Ray edition is really good, good enough that you don't notice it, you just feel like you're in the action.  It's as good as being at the theater.  The sound quality is also good, but not perfect; in places it's muddy, particularly when there's a lot of weather howling sounds.  Dialogue is crisp and easy to follow, but this doesn't drive your subwoofer as much as you'd expect given the subject matter, and some of the sound just doesn't pop like you'd figure.

1554173,5,B00005JMXX,"I have watched this movie several times on TV and it never fails to enthrall and frighten me with the awesome possibilities of Nature's forces. I would take the message of our careless abuse of natural resources to heart and since we create the problem of pollution we can find a solution( or several ) to improve the quality of the air we breath and share with all living creatures. Nature can't be controlled completely but we can learn to cooperate as a global community. And just like peace it begins with each of us.

The prospects of another ice-age followed by or preceeding global flooding
is very possible as we all are familiar with the story of Noah's flood and many ancient cultures mention the flood which gave birth to new life.
The message in this movie should not be taken lightly we do need to take better care of our environment.

As we approach Earth's completed cycle of its 11,000 year journey(the Mayan calendar was interpreted as approximately 25,000 years) and it reaches the position in the center of our galaxy (culminating around the first day of Winter 2012) our planet will wobble and more than likely more volcanoes will erupt and climate change will occur that includes the global flooding mentioned in Noah's day(Old Testament of the Bible) just as it's doing now. The Earth is billions of years old but extinction of any species is always possible. Humans survived the last ice-age and global flooding we can survive again as long as we know what is happening---just don't panic.

I found this movie to be an edge of the seat thriller packed with alot of unsettling more than possible real life special effects. Frozen air can destroy machinery and life forms can be flash frozen. The delicate balance of ocean currents can affect air flow masses and there is always the possibilities of superhurricanes,catogory 5 plus tornadoes combining together and tidal waves created by storm surges. These are happening at this time. And I will  mention the fact the poles keep our atmosphere cooler and if they do melt all at once  as Earth heats up ,the water rises and then begins to create steam and a jungle (greenhouse) effect. The temperatures and humidity would reach unbearable proportions for most life forms.

As far as the dialogue is concerened it is appropriate for the movie,kept it going and being concerned about family members,community and the need for survival is very human. I don't believe I have ever watched a scarier movie than this one whose only monster is the uncontrollable violent forces of Nature fighting to survive and the good Earth----our only home in this universe) conquors all.

I give the movie 5 stars for excellence in getting a difficult message across as a warning about the effects of global changes. What took earth billions of years to create and evolve in many life forms as flora and fauna humankind has managed to affect with our pollution of perhaps a century that can very likely bring about our demise.

The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the ""fun parts"" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don't make a bit of sense.

After the blizzard and sub-zero, unlivable weather conditions arrive the movie settles down to a young romance and survival story with Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Rossum and other people trapped in a library in New York City and Jake's father, played by Dennis Quaid, walking all the way from Philadelphia to rescue him.

 Yes, it's very, very far-fetched - the whole thing - but it's a fun adventure story with nice people. It's especially refreshing to see Hollywood portray a father as being so loving and selfless. The romance wasn't overdone and the young people were not profane and/or annoying, as so often is the case.

I say alternate because of the scenes where Dennis Quaid was in the kitchen with his friend was totally different from the theatrical version.

1554248,3,B00005JMXX,"When the movie made its big-screen debut in 2004 - and continuing with the various DVD releases - debate oftentimes degenerated into questioning the actual validity of the global warming/cooling that is depicted, while seemingly forgetting that this is a Sci-Fi action adventure. It would be like giving opinions on The Da Vinci Code and One Million Years B.C. as if the films are based on historical facts.

Produced, directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich, the special effects are absolutely incredible, but the story stumbles due to the generic characters that can plague this genre; arrogant politicians, misunderstood scientists and practical voices continually lost in the wilderness of society.

Dennis Quaid is climatologist Jack Hall who valiantly tries to make the top political leaders in Washington, D.C., understand the harsh ramifications of the emerging storms worldwide. After tackling this tough task, he sets forth on a journey through massive ice and snow to rescue his son (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who is trapped in New York City. Throughout the sojourn, both characters play off the themes of friendship, family and the will to survive.

There is a nice mix of special features - including scenes edited out of the film - that are interesting. But the storms steal the show and wash away a script that was built around the big bang of special effects and had cardboard cut-outs for characters.",1229472000,,1422,5.147186147186147
1554249,3,B00005JMXX,"I like to feel that I am balanced in my scorn of cod-science. For some reason, some people have taken offence to my review of ""State of Fear"", the Michael Crichton stinker. Ok, TDAT takes some pretty sound scientific principles and drives a bus through them to get a plot out of it. Lets be fair, no one is going to say ""oh My God, I`m going to be crushed by that rapidly advancing glacier if I stay routed to this spot for the next couple of thousand years"", so I can allow them their scientific whimsies for dramatic purposes. But I was able to ignore the science (and as an environmental scientist who does this stuff every day, if I can do it, so can you) enough to enjoy the film for what it is, an Independence Day type of disaster movie, and to be fair, probably more plausible than being invaded by aliens (which is kind of disappointing as I recently enjoyed a screening of ""V-The Mini-series"" on Sci-Fi Channel recently).

On the science front, I would place it as equivalent to cloning dinosaurs from extinct DNA, sounds sorta pseudo science possible, but actually we are unlikely to be over-run by velociraptors on our way to do the Christmas shopping next year. And if you are, like TDAT's tidal waves, a simple revolving door should keep you safe.

One thing I hope isn't true is that the makers of the film were asked to speak to Congressional Hearings on Climate Change. I don't think the film sets out to be ""An Inconvenient Truth"" with special effects, just a popcorn enhancing flick.  I like to think of it as more ""a convenient half truth"".

Director Roland Emmerich lends his usual subtle style to this story of a world in which we should constantly feel guilty for driving to get the pizza instead of walking.

I wish Hollywood would get a little more ballsy and start moving away from their tired mega-budget summer blockbuster strategy and invest just a little more capital in different projects. They would learn there is money in making better movies. ANYWAY, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is absurd and unless Americans are as dumb as apparently talk radio hosts seem to think their listeners are, this film does not work very well as propaganda for environmentalists. Actually to the extent environmental activists are linked to wacky movies like this they are regarded as extremists and crazy by much of the public. Well that's my take. Right-wing radio would go outta business if they didn't have Hollywood to demonize and whine about all day long like victimized babies. Anyway, ""liberal"" Hollywood is mostly about money, not ideas --whether the ideas be artistic, scientific, or even political and that's clear enough with THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

This one is done as they all too often are with the pretense that this scenerio could realistically happen in the real world but obviously that's nonsense and we're supposed to what? Suspend disbelief? But I don't want to. We're not supposed to laugh at it and not supposed to take it too seriously, obviously. We are to enjoy the ""eye candy"" and dim plot and dialogue but I'm not going to just enjoy CGI storms and buildings falling apart because I've seen it before and I sure have experienced enough mediocre story telling in my day.

""Emmerich obviously doesn't care if the science is flimsy, so why should you? --Jeff Shannon""

Gee, I don't know really. ""It's just a movie"" and so whatever.",1222214400,,2138,4.83879781420765

1554351,1,B00005JMXX,"Science fiction involves speculation or rational extrapolation based on current science or technology, so scientific rules have to be obeyed up to certain degree. Then, there is no choice but to classify The Day After Tomorrow as fantasy, because the science was so exaggerated and full of factual mistakes that not even the man-made global warming tribe was willing to defend it. Famous environmentalist George Monbiot called it ""a great movie and lousy science."" Realclimate.org compared it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/State-of-Fear/dp/0061015733/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">State of Fear</a>&nbsp;for addressing ""real scientific issues and controversies, but is similarly selective (and occasionally mistaken) about the basic science.""

The only positive comment has to do with the special effects, they are as good as their sister movies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day-Single-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005V9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>, from the same film Director.  Besides from SFX buffs and disaster movie fans, the only others who could really enjoy this movie is the small band of radicals, who in the name of a number of good causes, covertly advocate for industrialization, capitalism and globalization to end as the only means to save our planet. And this film makes their dream come truth, as the modern Ice Age forces most of the citizens from developed countries who survive to march as refugees to the Third World in exchange for their foreign debt. The Independence Day of climate change!

However, to be fair, it has to be noticed that The Day After Tomorrow was a big hit in the box office, so, unquestionably most moviegoers really love the combination of fantasy, good SFX, action, and disaster movies! This also explains the paradox of why so many Amazon reviewers agree on the exaggerations of the movie, but some rated it as five stars while others just one.",1215820800,,2200,6.450847457627119
1554352,5,B00005JMXX,"This was a great video! It shipped fast from Amazon and since it's a Blu-Ray movie, it looks even better than the original DVD.",1214611200,,127,4.333333333333333

1554357,3,B00005JMXX,"The Good Things
*Smashing special effects.  Very detailed, vivid, and exciting.
*Some memorable scenes.
*Storyline is relatively engaging; hardly boring.
*I suppose this is somewhat relevant to today's issues concerning climate change.
*Acting was not too bad.

The Bad Things
*Highly unbelievable.  Even if supercell storm systems have some kind of wierd cold air front, there's no way helicopters could freeze over in seconds and crash.  Some parts are downright silly; people were literally running away from growing frost.
*Sometimes, the characters act dumb; a few parts where you could yell at the screen for the people to run and seek shelter.  However, some of this stupidity is believable.
*Heavy focus on drama can be seen as sappy.

Only a step better than other disaster movies like ""The Core,"" this film has a typical plot with typical characters.  It is well made, with fantastic special effects, some interesting imagery, and adequate acting.  Some aspects can also be relevant to modern-day issues in climate change (and possibly immigration).  It is still a little shallow and highly unbelievable.  Fans of disaster films, or people who like good special effects, should probably check this out.  Otherwise, it is quite weak.",1207180800,,1242,5.253807106598985
1554358,5,B00005JMXX,"A very horrific part of planet earth that repeats itself every so often. This important to see, so that you will know how important global warning is.",1206921600,,150,4.592592592592593
1554359,4,B00005JMXX,"Here we are with another love it or hate it film. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was done by the same crew who brought you ""Independence Day"".

 Well, it's July 5th, and all h**l is breaking loose.
It all starts with the Larsen ""B"" ice shelf breaking up and falling into the Ocean (which was a real event, I might add). What happens from here, is best described as pure fiction (Science Fiction?).

Baseball-size hail in Japan, snow in India, tornadoes in Los Angeles, Helicopters freezing in flight above Scotland and a 100+feet storm surge in Manhattan. I think the only thing missing was fish and frogs raining from the sky in Kansas! All this leads up to three ""superstorms"" that signal the beginning of the new Ice Age.

Much time is given in the film to it's actors explaining away these occurrences, with Dennis Quaid leading the charge to think proactively, to protect the citizenry of the U.S. (it seems our government is only interested in money-WOW! big surprise, there!) The dramatization of the characters seems superfluous at times, with dialog that's just banal enough to put one to sleep. All the actors in this film make brave attempts to lend credibility to the story, but just can't get past the weather, which is the real star of this film.

The crazy weather IS interesting, though, especially when the choppers froze in mid air. The guy flash-freezing at the hatch of his helicopter is pretty good, and where better than Los Angeles, to get the ""Wizard of Oz"" treatment! Manhattan always seems to get the brunt of damage in disaster flicks, and one wonders why it's still standing!

It might seem that I'm bashing this film. On the contrary, there IS one thing that saves this film, and it happens to be my favorite part. It's when the ""new"" President of what's left of The United States gets in front of TV cameras and microphones, and ADMITS his fault in the handling of the disaster! I love it!!

The Scientific Community essentially dismissed this film outright, because of it's most glaring errors- The weather. Some said it was an ""overly severe"" example of the coming of the next Ice Age. Some even went so far as to say that many of the anomalies would not even occur! While I'm no scientist or meteorologist, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is a pretty good example of ""Escapist Reality""!

Some of the extras are interesting. There is a breakdown of the sound elements of a specific scene in the film, the usual deleted scenes, and commentary tracks. The Making-of segment is accessed by DVD-ROM.",1206748800,,2514,4.697727272727272
1554360,5,B00005JMXX,I saw this movie at theater and it was impressive. This movie story was excellent. The computer graphic technology was great. I really enjoy this movie. Some scenes are great. I really recommand for movie lovers.,1206403200,,212,4.916666666666667

In the L.A. tornado scene, you can feel the twisters swirling around you.  I noticed tons of debree that i did not notice in the regular dvd. Video is a 5+.",1203379200,,305,4.05

1554508,1,B00005JMXX,"I couldn't take this movie, and had to turn away after a half hour or so.  The acting is just par, the script is unintentionally hilarious (giant hail knocking Japanese unconscious on the streets of Tokyo could be mistaken for a great SNL skit, it's so funny), and the most overbearing, self-righteous eco-paternalism you have *ever* witnessed.

Unless you are hopelessly enthralled with the eco-fascists, skip this one.",1200182400,4,420,5.161764705882353
1554509,2,B00005JMXX,"this is quite possibly the worst piece of political tripe I have ever seen. global warming never looked so stupid on the big screen. unless, of course, you see this movie as a joke. In which case, this is actually an enteraining movie with such great quotes as ""the world is de-salinating"". the claims in this movie are so exaggerated and the images so foolish that it looks like a cartoon. Tornadoes in Hollywood? Hmmmmm. New york completely underwater within a matter of hours? It just makes you want to never trust hollywood's version of 'science' again.",1195948800,3,557,4.752577319587629
1554510,1,B00005JMXX,"The environmentalist whacko left, having condemned millions of Africans to malarial death via ""Silent Spring"", is now trying to reduce us all to pre-medieval peasant status by a general attack on Western industrial civilization.  Behold its latest ouevre, ""The Day after Tomorrow"".  ""The Vomit after Diarrhea"", in my humble opinion.

This movie is so bad, in so many ways.

First off, the acting is completely overwrought.  Regret and sadness practically ooooooooze from everyone's pores.  Scene after scene of people staring in glassy-eyed horror at some new disaster, big or small.  Gutenberg burned for warmth, as tears of regret flow.  Wolves hunting in cities.  Monster, city-destroying storms.  Americans fleeing to Mexico.

Then, the science is completely wrong.  That much climate change, that quickly?  Pah!  Completely unbelievable.

Finally, Americans feeing to Mexico?  Not a chance.  The Mexicans would gun down every American crossing the Rio Grande.

I hope MST3K comes back so they can feature this.  I wish Amazon had a ""minus star"" rating, for things like this that actively subtract from the joy of life through unmitigated dumbness.

UPDATE:  I'm watching this again on FX (11/17/2007 11:45 PM).  It doesn't get any better.  I cringe for these people, that they should have survived this.  We definitely are living in an age of mediocrity, and these actors are leading the way.",1194739200,8,1397,5.273972602739726

1554513,2,B00005JMXX,"You can almost see the guys sitting around a table planning the movie. They want disasters. Lots and lots of disasters. Lets do a tornado. No, that's been done. How about a bunch of them all at once? Great idea! And there, let's have high winds. What about earthquakes? Do we have time for that, while we're putting all of New York under ice? Hey, Frank, how long did the other ice ages take to start? I dunno Bill, but didn't I read somewhere that geological time is like a thousand times faster than normal time? Yeah. Something like that. Let's see now, do you think we should put in some science to try and explain it? Uh, okay, we'll say it's, uh, that's it's due to global warming! Yeah! And it's believable, that's what I like about it!!

Come to think of it, maybe I'm being too generous with the 2 stars.",1194134400,3,813,4.313725490196078
1554514,2,B00005JMXX,"I watched this with my wife and parents. By the way, I grew up in Alaska so I know COLD. My Dad and I just started laughing at the helicopter freezing up in mid-flight because the fuel started to solidify. My Dad was also an aircraft mechanic and although oil can get sludgy at low temps freezing aviation fuel is almost impossible outside a laboratory. But of course this is explained by some weird new weather phenomena that comes about in a matter of days, apparently.

The best part was the United States having to ask permission of Mexico to cross their border. I could almost hear Rik from the Young Ones saying ""take that, fascist bully-boy!"" Please. This thing is a politically correct fable from beginning to end. How else could you explain freezing hurricanes being the result of... global warming?",1193011200,3,808,4.690140845070423

With all of the new definition players this is a regular part of the maintenance.  It may be kind of a pain, but when you think about it, it is a nicer option than having to buy a whole new player to get newer features to work.

The action is the best part in this film. I loved the helicopter scene where they all just froze. Pretty amazing effects. I'm sure this film has a message that we should all be listening to, but it was awfully ridiculously quick how everything happened, and while I'm no scientist, I cant see all that happening in a span of pretty much 1 day.

It makes Night of the Living Dead look like science fact.  I suppose if I had seen it on a huge screen the visuals might have been impressive but on a TV screen - forget it.  The only thing that saves this loony tune waste is the always exceptional performance of Jake Gyllenhaal.

1554689,4,B00005JMXX,"If you look at this from the point of view of a film connoisseur, The Day After Tomorrow is simply awful. The plot doesn't really make sense, the science is nonsensical, the acting is nothing special, the dialogue is downright horrendous, and the film sort of seemed like Independence Day and Deep Impact smushed together into one giant cliche.

Well, I enjoyed both of those movies, and I enjoyed this one. There's something endearing about it despite how truly poor quality it really is. You can practically see what's going to happen before it does, yet somehow you still get excited when it does happen. I watched the ending 3 or 4 times in a row. And the special effects, which are really the only remarkable part of this movie, are spectacular. The science is bad, but they twist the explanation just well enough that you can convince yourself  that it MIGHT be possible, sort of like Jurassic Park. The acting gets the movie done. The only really awful part is the dialogue, but as long as you're not too finicky, you will probably enjoy this movie.

Two-star film, but I had a five-star viewing experience and would watch it again.",1186444800,2,1139,4.656716417910448
1554690,3,B00005JMXX,"As improbable as `The Day After Tomorrow' really is, it doesn't have to be realistic to fulfill its purpose.  It's not there to really engage us emotionally or mentally as much as visually, and in that visual sense `The Day After Tomorrow' soars.  Now director Roland Emmerich is no stranger to the science fiction disaster film, and not unlike his previously successful entries, this one also sports some amazing special effects.  From twirling twisters to tidal waves and that slowly creeping icy air, `The Day After Tomorrow' sports an amazing lineup of natural disasters.  Watching the multiple tornadoes rip through the California city is impressive, and watching gallon upon gallon of water drown New York City is nothing short of breathtaking.  So, it's safe to say that what `The Day After Tomorrow' lacks in brains it makes up for in cool CGI effects.

So, what of this plot?  Well, it appears that weather patterns are showing an alarming possibility that soon, within the next hundred or so years, we could undergo yet another ice-age.  That's where Jack Hall comes in, a climatologist who discovers the evidence to support this.  Of course no one will pay attention to Hall and his discovery will prove true, except not even Hall expected it to happen so soon.  The real story though involves Jack's son Sam who has traveled to New York with some class mates and ends up in the middle on a flood that destroys the city.  Jack then has to race to his rescue before he freezes to death.

As you can see, the plot is plenty far fetched, but the action more than makes up for it.  As Sam and his friends try to survive they must find food and medical supplies while fighting the increasing cold, the rising waters and a pack of temperamental wolves who happen to escape confinement during the flood.  The wolf pack has been met with mixed reviews, as in some loved it an others found it ridiculous and unnecessary.  I loved it.  It was an interesting and intense inclusion, even if it wasn't the slightest bit realistic.  When the movie as a whole is completely unbelievable and, yes, unrealistic, then there's nothing wrong with adding even more layers of complete and utter fiction as long as it looks good.

As far as the acting is concerned, it's all decent.  Your standard action film acting if you so desire to label it.  Dennis Quaid is one of those actors who I've always enjoyed yet felt he never really tapped into his potential, save except his performance in 2002's `Far From Heaven', and here he delivers but again it's nothing beyond acceptable.  Jake Gyllenhaal is an actor with a future, that's for sure, and his performances are always believable and effortless.  Here he does a great job juggling emotions amid a hole-riddled plot.  Emmy Rossum should really stick to singing, as her grandest performance was in `The Phantom of the Opera' but at least here she delivers a stronger performance than her `Poseidon' disaster.  The strongest performance here though came from the actress with the least screen time, Sela Ward.  She is just the definition of class and she manages to instill emotion in a rather emotionless film.

So, in the end `The Day After Tomorrow' delivers some extraordinary eye candy and is worthy of any science fiction action movie buffs library.  No, it's not smart, but it doesn't need to be; and to answer the question of some in regards to the movie's title, it refers to the day `AFTER' the calamity, when everything is not what it once was.  Come on people; is it really that hard to figure out?",1186444800,2,3549,4.717532467532467
1554691,4,B00005JMXX,"Despite some of the negative comments, this is well worth seeing for the awesome special effects alone. I wish the armchair critics would stop trying to analyze the ""logic"" behind this project and sit back and enjoy a good blockbuster thrill ride, which is obviously the aim of director Roland Emmerich. It's not meant to be a serious documentary about global warming. Sure, there are plot holes galore and the scientific data is not completely plausible, but this was meant to entertain popcorn audiences on a grand level of spectacular special effects and stunts, and it succeeds brilliantly on that level, greatly aided by a pulsating background score that accentuates the shocks and a soundtrack that gives all the visuals an extra punch.

My chief complaint, if we must insist on logic, is the fact that we have to accept the idea that a scientist would decide that he must walk to New York from Philadelphia at the height of the most drastic weather the world has ever known. This is where the script really requires the viewer to forget reason and concentrate on the stormy weather and chillingly spectacular photography.

Clearly, this is meant to be nothing more than entertainment for the masses, not a serious treatment of global warming despite such pretensions. Enjoy the awesome effects and forget logic. The viewer has to realize that scientifically, it's all in the realm of creative imagination rather than fact.

The performances are all competent enough, nothing deep required. Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Jake Gyllenhaal bring some humanity to the proceedings and make us believe in their dire predicaments. The understated romance between Rossum and Gyllenhaal is nicely handled. And speaking of the cinematography, the opening shot under the credits is one of the most visually stunning achievements in the whole film.

1554693,2,B00005JMXX,"I saw this movie when it was released, and I must say I was not impressed.

The concept of the movie had some serious potential, but the ball was dropped due to a number of factors.  One, the stoy was rushed.  Almost instantly the viewer is thrown into the story with very little build-up, which also costs the viewer time to get into the characters and actually get to care about what happens to them.  Secondly, when it comes to the order of how things happen, there is no order.  Random acts occur almost out of nowhere and without any real explanation.  I know that nature itself is unpredictable and for that reason only, it works.

Also, due to the rush of the story as I mentioned, there is no time to really get into the characters and thus, there is no reason to care about them (aside from the dog.)  I found myself actually saying that these people weren't prpared and they deserved what they got!

Overall, its a good movie to watch just for the heck of it and getting a good laugh; but its not worth any time beyond that.",1181692800,,1034,4.316062176165803
1554694,3,B00005JMXX,"The film shows scientists in the antarctic, their tests show global warming is increasing. The paradoxical result will be a frozen earth! TV news shows snow in New Delhi, large hailstones fall in Tokyo. The strongest hurricane has been recorded. A scientist's young son has discovered the politics of education. Sensors measure drops in the ocean's temperature. Birds and animals are restless and disturbed. What in the world is happening? Tornadoes in Los Angeles destroying the city! People are squashed like bugs. Typhoons in Australia! Could the North Atlantic current be changed due to melting ice (fresh water)? [It was cute to have a President who resembled Al Gore.

[Hollywood films usually have a happy ending.]

Back in the real world discussion continues on the effects of Global Warming. From the 10th to the 14th century the world was much warmer. Greenland was a green island where settlers lived on their crops. Southern England raised grapes for a wine industry. That changed in the 14th century, increasing cold led to food shortages, famine; then the Black Death killed over 30% of the population.

1554698,2,B00005JMXX,"I finally decided to do it. After much deliberation, I've finally decided to review Roland Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I must admit I liked his work on ""Independence Day"". The special effects in that movie achieved the loftiest of heights, creating a truly mesmerizing experience that entertained even though the whole thing suffered under a slew of plot holes the size of the Titanic. Unfortunately, Emmerich decided to indulge his appetite for left-wing politics with ""The Day After Tomorrow"". The subject? Global warming, of course! It's the new religion for millions of idiots with sad lives who have nothing better to do with their time. I think the whole global warming phenomenon is a bunch of bunk, a pseudo-scientific con job bolstered with shoddy ""facts"" that appeals to the media due to its lurid, sensationalistic potentialities. This film does absolutely nothing to advance the idea of global warming. In fact, it probably hurts the cause in ways unanticipated by the director. Oh well. No global warming induced sweat off my brow. Of course, none of this means I wouldn't watch the film. I'll always give a mindless action flick a go, even when said flick reeks of far left-wing pabulum.

I initially wept over the appearance of Dennis Quaid in the role of main character Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist (say that five times real fast) deeply concerned about warning signals he's receiving from Mother Nature. Then I decided to forgive him and just watch the movie. Hall claims that computers tell him that a new Ice Age is coming down the pike. He tries to warn people at some conference, but laughter essentially ushers him right out of the room. In films, laughing at leftists means disaster in the near future. And sure enough, weird stuff starts happening. Like what? Oh, the usual. Snow in warm climates, heavy winds knocking planes out of the sky, killer tornadoes wiping out Los Angeles, a tidal wave and freezing temperatures engulfing New York City, England icing over, massive super storms sending temperatures plunging in the northern half of the globe. Like I said, the usual. The special effects showing the disasters unfolding are pretty cool. I liked the reporter in L.A. dying horribly as a result of the tornadoes destructive power. I hope he believed in global warming. The New York scenes work well too, especially the tanker floating through the city streets. Pity about England, though.

Anyway, enough talk about the effects. Emmerich, having heard something about ""characters"" and ""a story"" somewhere in his career, tries to pull at our heartstrings with myriad plot lines both big and small. For example, Jack Hall's precocious kid Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) just happened to head to the Big Apple before the weather took a turn for the worse. He'll spend most of his time trying to get fellow student Laura (Emmy Rossum) to warm up to him (pun intended) during the time they seek shelter in the New York City library. Jack's wife Lucy (Sela Ward), a doctor by trade, spends her time weathering the disaster by taking care of a terminally ill cancer patient. Ian Holm shows up as a Scottish meteorologist long enough to turn the lights out in England. As for Jack, he foregoes helping the United States survive the storm in order to take a nice trek up to New York in order to save his estranged son. How heroic! How stupid! All sorts of threatening situations unfold, usually laughably, before this two-hour piece of propaganda shudders to a stop.  The conclusion plays around with the irony of Americans having to head to Mexico in order to survive the disaster. A[...] Ain't that a kick in the head!

A laugh a minute, this ""The Day After Tomorrow"". It's less a film and more a collection of jaw dropping inconsistencies, cackhanded dialogue, and shock and awe special effects. I won't kid around about the effects--they're awesome and superbly rendered. The unfolding calamity is the only reason to watch the movie. The rest of what we see onscreen is, as my 8th grade science teacher used to say, dumber than a box of rocks. Are we really supposed to believe these super storms, the size of continents, could form this quickly? And why isn't the southern hemisphere affected in some way? How can the temperature drop to at least minus 150 degrees yet we see characters ambling around outside? How can you drive and walk from Washington, D.C. to New York City in these conditions, and do it in a matter of a few days? The answer to all these niggling questions, and others, is simply this: it's in the script. The almighty script trumps all manner of problematic plot holes. Maybe we should use copies of the script to plug the hole in the ozone layer, or provide shade for our rapidly warming planet. You got a better idea?

If you're willing to turn your brain off before starting the DVD player, you'll probably make it through ""The Day After Tomorrow"" relatively unscathed. If you don't turn your brain off before watching, though, you risk serious and irreparable damage on such a scale that you'll resemble Al Gore for the rest of your life. Extras on the disc include a couple of commentaries from Emmerich and assorted personnel, a couple of deleted scenes that add nothing to the monstrosity we just watched, a sound demo, and a DVD-ROM featurette that I didn't bother to investigate. Not much for a ""blockbuster,"" but I see a double disc release has also come out. If you really like the film, pick that up instead. Lastly, an aside: Sela Ward is the most gorgeous woman on the planet. Her presence in the film eased some of the pain I felt from watching such a huge piece of misinformation. I'm ecstatic that she survived the film and went back to her career in television. Call me, Sela!",1178323200,5,5746,4.794147325933401

The Global warming is a serious matter, and since most of the governments all over the Globe are corrupted, they just think about making more money, expanding cities and making more industries destroying ecological places that should be untouched and protected, instead they are selling virgin forests and seashores to multimillionaire franchises that pay good money to expand their businesses that eventually will contaminate more our atmosphere and destroy the green areas which are the natural lungs and decontaminating filters of our planet .  The unscrupulously destruction of our forests/woods/jungles; spill of oils/chemical & human wastes on the ocean, and the throwing of chemical pollutants to the air will result in the same events shown on this apocalyptical movie.  The movie of course is ""Hollywood"" made, just to entertain.  The events that would take probably years were accelerated at a REAL fast pace... All the events won't occur in a 24-48 hours period, they will occur gradually within a long period, but I'm sure the purpose of the producers is not to give a full National Geographic documental, but a general scientific overview of events that awaits us because of our lack of respect to God's creation: our only one home, THE EARTH!!!

1554799,1,B00005JMXX,"What made this movie a ""disaster"" in and of itself was the miserable acting, ridiculous characters, aweful casting, and worst plotwork I've ever come across. An attempt at using the ""Independence Day"" movie-making formula that went way too far. Even the movie cover picture seems borrowed from the original Planet of the Apes. I won't get into the science or politics because that's not why I watched this movie. There are plot-spoliers ahead. Altough, this plot was already spoiled on its own.

Watching Quaid awkwardly trying to choke out big scientific terms was like watching Homer Simpson trying to recite Shakespeare. All of the other actors, except for Iam Holm, were even worse to the point of ridiculousness, and not just the characters that were -supposed- to be ridiculous.

In the span of 24 hours we have a global iceage disaster. Scientist Dad in PA gets out his snowshoes and promises to walk to his teenage son in NYC in the middle of the nightmarish weather onslaught that is wiping out billions of people in 150 degrees below zero with storms and floods.  Right. And what does he plan to do if gets there and if is son is still alive and if he can find him? Freeze to death together? Give him a sandwich? Take a nice stroll to Mexico in 150-below-zero?
With millions of people at hand, his son either would have been with some of them surviving already without the help of hero Dad, or he was dead like everyone else, or he relocated.
But no. We have our hero dad plodding along on foot unscathed in in the middle of an ongoing planetary disaster, the only person out of millions capable of doing this and surviving, to find sonny-boy and his cutesie friends, who just happen to be the few survivors in the city because dad was a smart enough scientist to tell them to light a fire and stay warm. I won't even bother listing the all the other unbearable shortcomings of this movie.

The final stake through the heart was the escaped-wolf nonsense, which takes the cake as one of the stupidest most desperate attempts at plotwork or adventure I've ever seen. 3 unrealistic computer-generated wolves just happen to escape the zoo, survive the overnight destruction of the whole city and its population, make their way across the city to find our little heroes and harass them the instant they stick a toe out the door. If they had replaced the wolves with looters it might have been believable.

This movie is so far gone its no longer even about ""willing suspension of disbelief"" or ""fun entertainment"". At serveral points I had to force myself to avoid shutting it off and snapping the DVD in half. The fact that people can give a movie like this 5 star reviews is a testament as to how far the viewing demands of the movie-going population have fallen.

At least it shows that yes, wolves attack anything when they travel in packs and do attack just to attack and not just because ""they are hungry"".  It was nice to see the Zombies get swallowed up by a giant wave but c'mon, really now, do we want all the zombies to drown at the SAME TIME?  Quaid is a great actor and along with Sela Ward really give this show a good standing.  I just cannot give it five stars because it is obvious that it is politically motivated.  Now, if the facts are facts, that is one thing but c'mon, really now, why try and ram the message down our throats with a fictional tale of what it takes millions of years to happen (naturally, by mother nature, not by some guy driving a Barracuda down main) and pack it into an single day?  Of course even beyond that there is so much garbage to wade through.  Like, you know, I mean c'mon, so the Big Apple gets over 1,000 feet of icy layering and yet Quaid's character is still driving, then walking on even ground from PA?  C'mon now, at least show some climbing of cliffs or something.

Being a science teacher, it's difficult to watch a movie like this without finding all the flaws. Then they report that the temperature is dropping 10 degrees per second (600 degrees per minute? is that C or F?). Even though buildings are freezing solid and crumbling, Quaid and his buddy are comfortable in a tent. Then in the library, there are about a dozen people trying to heat up a room the size of a movie theater by burning books. Don't they know that it would be much more efficient to heat a smaller room? Remember when they went on the Russian ship? I was thinking that they could all move into that, and use all the diesel fuel, medicine, and food on board. Dang those poor wolves had a lot of energy considering they were starving to death and half frozen. The special effects were more comical than realistic.

1554953,3,B00005JMXX,"THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW has widely been ridiculed as one of the silliest movies of recent years and was the recipient of utterly awful reviews when it was released.  Having heard all of this, I was hardly tempted to watch it for some time.  But recently I was in the mood for a disaster movie, and having recently watched the Val Guest British classic THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE, I was interested in seeing it destroyed by ice as well.  Although this is one of the most thoroughly panned films of recent years by critics, I thought it was, in fact, a very entertaining film.

Yes, the plot is silly.  Rather, it is impossible precisely as presented.  I am not an authority on the subject, but I have read that the central scenario is not impossible, but that it would take place over a much longer time frame than seen in the film.  An ecological disaster is not impossible, but it won't occur in a week.

The film has a decent cast, but honestly, who cares?  A film like this is not driven by the cast but by the special effects.  The effects found in this film are among the most memorable one will find, with one exception.  The exception is the CGI for the wolves that attack Jake Gyllenhaal and his friends.  They look absurdly artificial and computer generated, which is made worse by the fact that so many other things in the movie look so great.  There is a great deal of silliness:  the ship that floats up Fifth Avenue and comes to a halt in front of the New York Public Library.  It is absolutely impossible to plot a feasible path for a ship to take to reach the library.

Still, once one gets past the silliness, the film is unquestionably quite entertaining.  The tornadoes hitting Los Angeles are amazingly well done and fun to watch while one scene after another is a delight to watch.  We all enjoy movies in which the world comes to an end or at least comes to an end as we know it.  As a kid I loved reading J. G. Ballard's novels that imaginatively bring the world to a close in one way or another, whether by wind, drought, or water.

Unless you are completely unable to get past an initial absurd premise, I definitely thing most people will enjoy this.  Besides, much has occurred the past two years to make the idea of ecological disaster more plausible.  Numerous books detailing global warming have appeared, an official in the Bush administration has finally acknowledged that global warming is real, there have been numerous fractures in the Religious Right over global warming, and even Pat Robertson has stated that he was wrong on global warming and now acknowledges that it is caused by humans and requires that we dramatically reduce greenhouse emissions.  And Al Gore released his superb documentary.  So while we won't get any ecological disasters precisely as found in this film, it isn't as unthinkable as it used to be.",1157241600,4,2859,4.5390625

""Let's see, we've got massive tornados in L.A., tidal wave engulfing NYC, an almost immediate deep-freeze that kills instantly, and a sick character who needs medication or she will die, what could make this better?  Wolves!  Yes, we need escaped wolves.""

Sheesh.  If anyone thinks the CGI effects in this movie are fabulous, they've obviously never seen a real wolf.  Those things weren't even close.

Oh, and let's not forget the zoo that keeps the bears, sheep, and wolves right next to each other in a small building.  Riiight.

I spent most of the movie either laughing at the absurdity of the scenario, and getting nauseated by the ""sentimental"" scenes.

I'm not even going to go into the horrible plot, cliches galore, and all of the other just plain wrong things about this movie.  I'm not going to touch on the overt environmental and political messages that probably did more damage to real and important climate concerns - since from the reviews it seems some people actually believed this was even remotely plausible, while others used it to deepen their hatred of ""greenies"".

This movie continually reminds me of the four+ days of almost non-stop rain that we had recently in New York City. And I thought, is what the movie saying coming to pass? This movie has heightened my awareness, and articles such as the one recently printed by the New York Times on Global Warming AND the shift in global climate, have hopefully caused others to become more aware as well. The planet is experiencing desertification and drought in more places, continuous and spreading. Hurricanes in Boston and tornadoes in upstate New York are signs that what we are experiencing and what the Earth and its keeper are trying to tell us is...STOP!!!

Please buy this movie and then do your part. We cannot prevent or stop this possible scenerio from occurring, but we can slow down the process.

They didn't miss a trick.  Everybody has their own favorite scene in this movie, whether it's the tornado shredding the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, or hail the size of soccer balls falling on the beach in Malibu, or the rainfall guysering up through the manholes in Manhattan... my own favorite is the giant wave about to engulf the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor and getting ready to flood out all of the Lower East Side and midtown. The first hour of this film is a special effects fanatic's delight.

And a good thing, too, because once the special effects are done, what's left of the movie falls flatter than the proverbial pancake. Alas, Roland Emmerich never realized that great special effects do not a great movie make. Once the deep freeze outside is on, the movie freezes up as well. We've heard it all before -- the lone, unregarded scientist, preaching doom and gloom, ignored until too late; his super-bright, nerdy kid who solves complicated calculus problems in his head, competing for the cute coed against the rich kid from the Ivies... is there a cliche that Emmerich forgot to add to this film? Well, the general plot line is interesting, if not altogether original -- global warming leading to a global deep freeze, although this time the deep freeze happens in days, not centuries (there's progress for ya!), but the ""human interest"" side plots add absolutely nothing to the script and are at best a big yawn and at worst just plain irritating. The acting is adequate, but just barely. The rain, snow and hail have more personality than the actors.

If Emmerich thought he was giving us a deep film that would sound a global alarm on the dangers of global warming, he's too full of himself to be taken seriously. As if anyone would take this movie seriously. It's a fun movie, and taken as such, it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV.

1555042,4,B00005JMXX,"The Day After Tomorrow came out almost three years ago. This movie depicted global warming events and the ever lasting damages the world would have to face. However the writer did push the movie a little too far, because the chances of an ice age happening over the next two weeks would be highly unlikely. Our weather is changing dramatically; here in Canada, our winters have become much warmer than they used to be. This movie should be a warning sign for everyone.

  The movie aimed its audience well, and had some real good facts. Although the events depicted were done in an unrealistic timeframe, the actual events were probably not too far off base. The tornadoes in L.A. and the snow in New Delhi, this will all happen one day. They nailed the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and the effects it has on the world. The movie showed us what we could be headed for if people don't start waking up and seeing and believing global warming. Too many people are in denial and I hope all these people get out and watch this movie at least once. Everyone should have to see this movie once; the facts are there and the reality is there it just needs to be set in.

  Although this movie made some good sense out of global warming and its effects, the movie had some good special effects. The actors did a good job playing their roles and played the character real good. The music played in the movie was not bad either. To me, this movie was great and is a must see.

1555046,2,B00005JMXX,"The Day After Tomorrow seems to be just a few years late on the disaster film gravey train.  I'm not sure if this was an attempt to revive disaster film, or if it is just the director who is stuck in a time warp.  If it is the case of the former, he isn't doing the genre any favours with this movie.

  The Day After Tomorrow don't seem to have any shame in doing text book disaster film plotlines.  If you've seen other disaster films, then you've definitely seen this movie before.  The plot is predictable.  We have the typical science guy who sees something wrong with the earth, check.  He goes and inform the government, but they do nothing about it, check.  He then finds out the threat is worse then even he suspected, check.  30 or 400 minutes deep into the movie we see a number of natural disasters nearly level the planets biggest cities, check.  Okay now we have a struggle for survival, as the victims try to outlive the onslaught with a lot of misadventures and incredible circumstances, check.  Rinse, repeat, etc, etc.  We have the disaster film formula for sure here.

  If it weren't for the acting, which IS over the top, but still subtle enough to see that they are actually taking themselves serious, I would have sworn this movie was a parody.  Disaster films haven't been a draw since 1999, and 5 years later, after the genre is sucked dry, we get The Day After Tomorrow.  I thought we were seeing the Scream of disaster movies, but apparently not.  Anyway, the special effects were awesome, which lead me to give it just one more star.

This is an actual treaty, mentioned in the film, that the United States refused to join other industrialized nations in signing.

The polar ice caps are melting.  What if the flood of cold water into the ocean brings catacylsmic weather?

I was reminded of the campy sci-fi of the 1950's, but without the campiness imparted by the intervening decades.

With slightly better writing, I felt this could have been an entertaining movie.  Having the father, a scientist and presumably an intelligent person, rush out into the storm to find his son was lame to say the least.  In real life he would know better.

1555183,3,B00005JMXX,"...The moral stand point at the core of this film is at the very least worthy if a little overplayed. It hits hard with two weighty political themes not necessarily readily embraced by western governments or indeed the wests affluent populations. One theme, Global warming as a result of reckless waste, is very prevailant, at times to the point of annoyance.

The closing addition of the west's gratitude and sorrow for past misdemeanour to the ""third world"" is paid such scant reference it could very easily be overlooked, one cannot help but to wonder if it is thinly disguised, anti-Bush comment.

 Generally such films are viewed for their special effects, which here are stunning and do not dissapoint (save for some rather ropey looking escaped wolves which border on disneyesque!).

 The actors are generally speaking, understudies to the action in such films, but here there is the added bonus of Jake Gyllenhaal who plays his role (the troubled genius kid) with more credence than the average display. He resists the temptation to be bullish and sensitively progresses from disillusioned teenager to thoughtful young men. A testament to his thespian skill as we witness in some of his earlier roles and many of latter ones (Donnie Darko, The Good Girl, Brokeback Mountain, Jarhead etc), unfortunately it is a rather wasted effort in this film.

Quaid is stoic and masterful but a little lost, you need to see the the man in ""Far from Heaven"" to truly witness his impact. Ward is credible as the heroic Dr/Wife/Mother if a little over-emotional and other than a plastic and irrtaing performance by Chapman, as the girl love interest for Gyllenhaal, (I almost hoped her septicaemia would be fatal!), the cast just dissapear in the face of the unlikely but sobering special effects.

 My only other comment would be to watch the film in summer if you don't wish to be tooth-chatteringly frozen by it's conclusion!",1138924800,4,1920,4.959501557632398

I can, however, envision how the picture's script was written: The writers sat around watching bad disaster movies, a la MST3K, while drinking vast quantities of beer.

The last Ice Age took place a litte over ten (count em') ten

 It took several hundred years for it to form. And it lasted less than a thousand years. Then the earth warmed up again due to certain geologic changes.(the shifting of the land masses, as well as a slight tilting of the earth's axis.)

 Now with that over with, The Day after Tomorrow, is a fun movie to watch.

 As long as you can suspend your belief that what took hundreds of years to take place, can happen within a few weeks!

 The special effects is the real star of the picture.

 Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ian Holm are just extras on

the set.

Dennis gives his usual affable guy performance. Jake's performance is somewhat better than it seems. Here he is trying

to give his charicter a sense of growth. From a snotty smart kid

to a mature young man. Here you get a peek at how good an actor Jake Gyllenhaal will become. (witness Jarhead,and Brokeback Mt.)

1555264,3,B00005JMXX,"IN A NUTSHELL: DOES IT REALLY MATTER THAT THIS IS ""REEL-EE"" BAD SCIENCE?

Did it matter that ""Independence Day"" by the same Director had even less of a connection with possible future scenarios? NO, but ""Independence Day"" did not rely so heavily on special effects [though it was full of them] and therein lies part of the difference. ""Independence Day"" also had a unique chemistry that seemed to give it a connection to 50's-style, alien-invader flicks, thereby cultivating an affinity from those fans --including me.

After all, does ""Superman"" [the ""good alien invader""] need to be believable? - - - - -

DOES STAR WARS NEED TO BE GOOD SCIENCE TO BELIEVE IN THE FILMS? DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE FORCE?

Of course, the science is ridiculous in almost all of these speculative fiction flicks. Remember this is Hollywood film fiction and this fictional account is not ""Gone With The Wind"". On the other hand, I found ""THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW"" to be so much more watchable than ""Men In Black"" which suffered from an excess of humourous, flashy, fanciful, madcap, silly, glib and goofy moods to be watchable for me.

This film appears to be trying at least to make a go of it. By that I mean making the unbelievable less, well, unbelievable. Dennis Quaid as a scientist-husband-father does well to keep us connected emotionally to the horrific events lending some much needed empathy to this spectacle. Ian Holm as the Brittish scientist is, well, Ian Holm; which is to say he always turns in a top-notch performance and his sequences are much needed in making the most unscientific theories work well enough to partially suspend our disbelief -- hopefully for at least 123 minutes.

Going against the film is the obvious post-9/11 sentiment, making the destruction of American cities, shown principally to American audiences, somewhat worse than politically incorrect. To some people it may have seemed like rape victims watching a rape story movie, very sordid, but I did not realize that until I heard it from other people. Perhaps because I did not see the film until over 3 years after 9/11? If that is the case, the destruction of cities may be less offensive if you are NOW seeing the film for the first time, but that is just speculation.

THE DVD & FEATURES

Despite its inherent flaws, it plays somewhat interestingly, especially in this widescreen format. You can play it in ""English"", Spanish"", and French"" and there are subtitles available in English or Spanish. If you want the ""DTS Surround Sound"" this is available in English only. There are also some neat features like 2 separate commentary tracks and an hour-long featurette [""the making of""]. Of course there is the scene-selector feature and there are enough scenes that you won't have trouble getting to where you wish to go. There are also ""deleted scenes"" and an ""audio anatomy-interactive sound demo"".

BOTTOM LINE:

The sound and video quality are great, which is as it should be on a new, high-budget release. The film is bad science, ""reel"" bad science, but it does retain a decent, and spectacular story, though more than a bit ridiculous. Ridiculous sometimes works in fantasy, though it is a bit harder sell in science fiction. In any event, the choice is up to us, the movie viewing public.

Recently, this DVD has been heavily discounted and is now available widely for about half the original price, or about $10.00.",1137110400,3,3393,4.852941176470588
1555265,1,B00005JMXX,"The last time I attempted to review this truly offensive Hollywood fake n' gooey claptrap I was sensored by Amazon.com for using a bad four-letter word minus one vital letter.  We'll see if I clean it up a bit if they let me in the club this time.  I really don't care to discuss the much beaten, stirred n' shaken human relations story line in my review, you can read the short blub at the intro to these ""open"" reviews if you'd like that.  I'm simply here to stear you clear from wasting some of your valuable time, or at least to help you waste it in a more entertaining fashion (which would be any other activity you can think of).

The basis for the movie, as you probably know, is the weather patterns everywhere go bizerk for a few days because of the awful misuse of technology and what-have-you by humankind.  The meterologists at The Weather Channel must have cringed all the way through TDAT, which would be more aptly descibed if you replaced that ""D"" with a ""W"" in the aforementioned acronym.  In this hair-brained, ultra-dull Californiafied mess, the impossible becomes reality in a amazingly short amount of time.  Also incredibly, this movie seems longer than the several day time span than it supposedly encompasses.

When it comes to the acting itself, you'll see the spectrum from adequate and predictable from Dennis Quaid to annoying and overwrought by Jack Gyllenhaal.  You've seen Dennis give these horrified/perplexed looks throughout his disaster-flick riddled career.  And Jake, well.... he's the brainiac kid that could have saved the world if he could have just got them all into a gigantic underground room with a generous fireplace.  Possibly this movie could have earned two stars if they would have brought in Quaid's brother Randy for a little comic relief; warning us all that there is a giant ""dung"" cloud coming, just as he did in King Pin (good flick).  But alas, this is one more global crisis movie with no sense of humor.  It did make me think for a minute about taking a vacation in Mexico during this nice Jersey winter.

1555267,4,B00005JMXX,"You should go see ""The Day After Tomorrow"" because it is full of intensity and because of its realistic scenes.  However if you were someone who doesn't believe in the world ending I wouldn't go so this.

I watched this movie on November 22 of 2005 at home by myself.  It was 2 hrs. and 4 minutes with a PG-13 rating and was directed by Roland Emmerich.  I have also watched this in previous times with my family.  It was definitely different watching it the second time because you already know the whole story but since it is such a wonderful movie with breathe taking visual effects you still focus in on it.  My family also thought it was a great movie.

This movie received great reviews.  Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-times thought that the movie was silly but at the same time was very intrigued with the special effects.  That is one of the strengths that I also found fascinating in the movie and how real they made each scene seem.  They also had great actors and actresses that made the movie full of feelings.  You can really tell that the actors were feeling the scenes.  They all gave a wonderful performance and they all came together for a marvelous performance.

It's full of excitement and keeps you wanting more at the end.  They had it made so realistic that it makes you think what if it happened on this time frame that you are living in now.  The story is developed from researchers in the middle of a huge glacier trying to gather information and with the start of the tragedies.  The catastrophes happen right after the other but you never know what it's going to be next; whether it'll be a huge earth wake or just everyone dying and the world ending.  This movie was very scary in its own way because it showed what would happen in the feature and how anything can happen in an instant.  If you were someone who was even afraid of dying would probably pee your pants if you watched this movie.  I think people with phobias of that sort would not sleep for days having nightmares of the situations in the movie.

 They had great special affects using CGI.  Their scenes looked so real you wouldn't think it was done on a computer.  All the weather conditions looked like it took time and was developed greatly.  I thought that the scenes of Los Angeles and New York were the best.  This movie was filled with great images which made it look so realistic.

I didn't know that so much was involved in our world.  How we actually have real researchers out there trying to keep up with matter like this that would affect our world.  This movie showed that once there is a problem then it must be announced to leaders around the world.  This movie makes you think what if this happened tomorrow.

 Never take your life for granted because anything can happen tomorrow.  Always be prepared and be smart about situations.  Watch this movie because it sure will make you think about what revolves around you.  I recommend this movie to be watched it is worth your money.",1134518400,2,2986,4.468518518518518
1555268,1,B00005JMXX,"I will give you that the special effects in the first half of the film are decent.  But the huge plot holes and stupefying dialogue just ruin any positive value in this film.  Examples:

1.  Why is it that only the Northern Hemisphere is effected?  I would thnk that southern South America and Australia may not be happy with a new Ice Age either.  And if the climate change is caused by a shift in the North Atlantic current, why did Tokyo get pounded?

2.  And for that matter, what a coincidence that there are three or four tornadoes on the west coast of the U.S., and they all are in downtown L.A.?

2a.  Considering the above L.A. tornadoes, would traffic helicopters really fly around in the storms hoping to get a good shot of them?

3.  A wall of water inundates New York City, close to 150 feet high, enough to almost cover the Statue of Liberty.  Yet interestingly this unprecedented tidal wave has no effect on Washington D.C., which sits about 10 feet above sea level.

4.  Even though all of Manhattan is under said 150 feet of water, the pay phones still work!  And Boy Hero is able to easily get through to his parents in D.C.  Last time I tried to make a call during a blizzard all I got were ""all circuits are busy"" messages.  Gotta love Verizon!  Also, I never did figure if the Boy Hero pluncked in a bunch of quarters to make his call or called collect.

4a.  During the phone call, why doesn't Boy Hero tell his parents ""hey, the water here is up to my neck, I gotta go now?""

5.  Dad hero walking from Philly to NYC in 13 feet of snow and blizzard conditions (with temperatures around -150 degrees below zero).  In a little over one day.  'Nuff said.

5a. Overnight during said walk, Dad Hero is protected from the winds (which cause large buildings to crumble) by a nylon pup tent.

6.  While Boy Hero and teenage pals are holed up in the NYC Library trying to keep warm (apparently hugs from his to soon-to-be girlfreind weren't enough), they decide to burn books in the fireplace.  First, would the hundreds of wooden chairs made more efficient burning material?  Second, why didn't the above mentioned -150 degree air, which we were told over and over would kill anything in its path, enter the library through the open fireplace flue and kill them all?

6a.  BTW, that reminds me, of the group of teens (you know, those movie ""teens"" who are in high school but all look like they are 25) holed up in the library, Boy Hero is the only one who ever mentioned his parents.  I guess the rest of the crew didn't give a damn about their families.

7.  At the end of the film, while leaving NYC where at least 6 million people have died, Boy Hero and Dad Hero smile because, hey, at least Boy Hero got his girl.

I won't even get into all the bull**** science dumped on us during the film.

8. But I do have to mention that according to the U.S. Geological Survey, during the previous Ice Age glaciers probably reached somewhere around the 40th parralel.  While NYC could be covered by ice in a future Ice Age, fleeing into Mexico is probably a bit dramatic.

Note that the above list could be three times as long if I felt like spending the time to write any more.

Overall, a waste of time.  Maybe if you cut out everything but the L.A. and NYC destruction you could have an entertaining 15-minute featurette.",1134518400,36,3332,4.370309951060359
1555269,1,B00005JMXX,"this movie manages to do it.  And it's sad.  The idea that the earth is on the verge of another Ice Age has tremendous scientific merit and is one that should be more widely discussed.  In addition there hasn't been a real good epic disaster film in a while and this one could've filled the bill.

Could have, but didn't.  It failed because (and I know this is going to sound like a worn out cliche straight from talk radio) because it was made from a liberal perspective, with all of the attendent elitism, sensationalism, politically correct soapboxing and cultural biases that plague the Left.

For example, this film purports to show the results of a global climate change, yet it focuses primarily on (surprise, surprise) New York City, although LA gets a cameo spot.  What about where the rest of us live, like Greenville, Mississippi, Davenport, Iowa and Fuller's Acre, Missouri?  It seems that for some people the largest urban population centers in the US ARE the United States, except for some meaningless flyover country populated by cave dwellers, fundamentalist crazies and inbred hillbillies.  In any event, focusing on a larger geographic area would have broadened the movie's appeal.

Then there is the incessant and irrational preaching about how man-made greenhouse gasses are causing the tragedy.  It ignores the fact that previous Ice Ages came along without a single factory or SUV pumping carbon monoxide into the air.  Sorry, but you can't blame big business and the Republicans for this one, greenies.

And yes, I got the point that industrial activity may be accelerating the pace towards the next Ice Age, but this position ignores the counter point that man-made warming of the earth may be the only thing that keeps the next one from occuring.  The next time you see someone driving a gas-guzzling 4x4 belching out exhaust, give 'em a hug; they might just be saving the world.

Then there were the characters, or should I say caricatures.  Quaid plays the role of the concerned scientist (who drives an eco-friendly hybrd) whose pleas are ignored by the evil vice-president, whose only concern is big business. Throughout the story scientists and journalists are portrayed as noble and virtuous, while business owners and workaday people are cruel, stupid bigots destroying mother earth.

Quaid has a teenage son in the movie.  His biggest problems are his unfair calculus teacher and the girl he likes but doesn't know how to approach; he spends most of the film glaring at her while forgetting to comb his hair.  He is in NYC with his nerdy friends to compete in an academic version of Jeopardy.  They spend most of the time looking smug and pondering questions about how the Americas were conquered by evil Europeans.

In short, this movie takes an implausible scenario and shows how it affects the lives of people who are so out of the mainstream that few ""regular"" folk know anyone like them.  There is scarce attention paid to the average Joe or Jane.  There is, however,  the obligatory African-American homeless guy with shopping bags wrapped around his head who keeps getting tossed out of buildings by angry white men.  This film is so politically correct it's nauseating.

There are plenty of other faults, such as the wooden ""acting"" and ridiculous scenarios.  For example, in one scene the son and his elite friends are watching the world wash away on TV when one of them casually mentions he has to drive to Philadelphia to pick up his brother.  He asks the others if they want to ride with him.  The fact that the northeastern US is under four feet of water, making highway travel impossible, doesn't seem to register in his academically gifted brain.

Poorly written, poorly acted, and preachy to the core, The Day After Tomorrow is a boring movie about boring people going through things that should be exciting but are made to look boring.  Watch it if you want to be bored.",1134086400,8,3920,4.849624060150376

1555271,2,B00005JMXX,"This movie had a great potential to be entertaining, realistic (enough), and educational on consequences for a country that so often neglects the environment.  The movie started out this way, but the storm seems to almost have a life of its own (that it is almost hunting the main characters).  The movie plays over a few weeks (days? doesn't really specify very well), whereas it should have run over at least months if not a couple years to make it not completely implausible.  By ignoring reality to the highest degree, this movie disgraced those committed to preventing climate change (it made a mockery of it).

The movie started out well, suggesting that these things would take time to pan out.  Then, as the story gets going, the timelines are all wrong and the events are cut to weeks and then to ?days?.  The only reason I could possibly imagine that this was done was to try to get an rush for the audience and make this into a thriller movie, not a realistic one.  Because it was so over the top, I and apparently a lot of others who have reviewed this movie lost interest.  Instead of thinking, ""Is this character going to live or die?"" or ""Wow, I can really see this actually happening,"" you say to yourself, ""Are you serious?  Why does the story keep changing?  None of this makes any sense in reality.  Hollywood sold out on an excellent idea for a horrible storyline.""  I could write about several parts in this movie that violated conservation of energy and simple physics laws -- it was done left and right and made the scientists look like idiots.

If you don't mind a movie that doesn't necessarily make sense, you will probably like this movie.  If you like movies that are  mildly plausible (or better), you will sit and question the entire second half of the movie (and laugh at them as they all attempt to walk hundreds of miles in the snow storm that is larger than a hurricane and reshapes the northern hemisphere).",1133654400,4,1942,4.572254335260116

1555322,3,B00005JMXX,"Say what you will about the charachters, the weird science, or the silly wolves, but you can't deny that the day after tommorow knows how to destroy, freeze, or superfreze the world into a very chilly ice cube.

Inspired by the book ""The coming global superstorm"", the day after tommorow follows the idea ""What if a new ice age happened this week?"".  The story concerns a weather science guy as he tries to rescue his son, who's trapped in manhattan after a nasty tidal wave.  All the while, all of humanity must try to survive as temperatures plunge and earth essentially becomes an ice cube.

While one can debate the questionable physics of the movie (walking from Washington to Manhattan in a few days during a massive snowstorm, how warming up the planet causes an ice age, etc.), one cannot deny the incredible atmosphere and visual destruction the movie unleashes.  The movie's greatest strength is it's atmosphere.  One really gets the feeling that this really is the end of the world (at least for the northern hemisphere).  The destruction shown, the massive amounts of human life lost, the destructive weather, all of it adds up to a very effective and belivable atmosphere.  I'm not ashamed to admit that at times I actually felt cold while watching the movie!

The special effects are, as one would suspect, terrific.  The tornadoes, blizzards, all of it looks perfectly belivable and realistic.  The standout sequence occurs when the massive tidal wave barrels through manhattan in a scene that gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.  If you want a movie where you get buildings trashed by tornadoes, the british isles getting buried under fifteen feet of snow, and tidal waves washing through manhattan, then this movie is for you!

Like the effects and the atmosphere, the film also does a standout job audio-wise.  The music is very good and effective at creating a sometimes tense, sometimes haunting atmosphere.  The main theme in paticular, is very effective at conveying despair, yet at the same time, hope.  The sound effects do an astonishing job of conveying howling wind and freezing snow, all of it adding to and enriching the atmosphere of the movie.

But atmosphere and visuals will only take you so far.  What about the charachters, on whom the movie puts it's backbone on?  Regrettably, the charachters are not very effective.  All of the actors in the movie, major or minor, do a very good job in thier respective parts, but a lot of them are not very interesting.  We get two primary chrachters (the scientist and his son) and close to two dozen secondary charachters, most of whom have little to do.  It's a sad fact of movies that if you have a secondary chrachter on screen for a grand total of five minutes before he/she dies, you don't get emotionally attatched to them.  Such is the case with The day after tommorow.  I couldn't remember over 3/4th's of the charachters names except Sam and Frank (and only then becuase the father keeps shouting, ""FRANK!"").  Instead of names,  you have to go by, ""Library guy"" ""Library woman"" ""Homeless guy with dog"" ""Government guy who argues with father"" ""Father's sidekick"".  That doesn't mean that these side charachters are boring, per se, it's just that we don't really care about them.  The only real exception is the policeman, who has a small part, but is portrayed very well and very effectivly.  He was the only real charachter I cared about.

I really don't care about the bad movie physics here (In real life, the statue of liberty would have toppled over the moment the tidal wave hit it).  The way the movie does present the physics makes it look belivable, and that's fine with me.

The biggest problem I have with the day after tommorow is it's pacing.  The first two acts of the movie are gripping and holds you attention very easily.  The third act however, falls and stumbles, failing to hold our attention as well as it did previously.  A big part of this is the fact that the climax of the movie (the superfreeze) takes place approximatly fifteen minutes before the end of the movie.  You've no doubt heard about the silly wolves sequence, and i'm sad to say that the wolves part of the story is very silly and pretty much pointless.  It would be much more effective if the wolves were replaced by starving, crazed humans who have lost thier mind.

The emotional climax is a bit flat, not really bringing things to a satisfying end.  One rather unfortunate reality of this type of story is that there's no villian, no antagonist to focus all the negativity on.  Here the foe is mother nature.  So, how do you plan to defeat mother nature and win the day? (Hint:  You don't).  It is admittingly very tough to write an ending to a movie where your villian is the forces of nature, who cannot be defeated by lots and lots of guns.

But in the end, the movie is an excuse to go and experience a great atmosphere and see lots of destruction, not to see emotionally involving charachter stories.  The overall message of the movie, that we shouldn't mess with mother nature, is the main point of the movie, regardless of how we get there.  I have to say that it's message is conveyed fairly well, as it gets you thinking about how humans are polluting the planet and what the consequences might be.

So in the end, see the movie for it's effective atmosphere and special effects.  Don't go in expecting extremly involving charachters and a satisfying climax and ending.

So you have Jake Gyllenhall (?) running around being smart with all the smart kids being smart at a smart convention. This was Jakes hardest roll yet playing a smart kid. Then you have some guy (forgot his name) being all smart and telling everyone that the world is going to technicly emplode. Yay. So then he messes up and finds out that the world is ending like in 3 days and everybody has to get out from the north. No one belives him untill everything smart getting frozen and people dye! Go special effects!! So then they are trapped in New York and the love story develops between the person Jake didthe smart team for. Then,onme of the gets sick and then they have to go on  the boat that floated to the front of the library. They get on it and they were carring animals (i think) and they find all sorts of goodies. Then the dogs attack! AHHH!!!So slowly stuff like that is going on and the world is ending which shows like sence of helicopters flying and freezing in midair and crashing. Good stuff. So everything is bad and then they finally get to NY and find his fun in the library and then send them to mexico!

The CGI and visual element was innovative and extremely exciting. The 'science' of the film - (can a film have science anyway?) was not as bad as many here think, it stands to reason that if a hurricane is powerful enough and the pressure at it's core low enough then it could draw freezing air downward from the upper layers of the atmosphere - in theory, however if it happens i don't expect it to happen like it did in this movie! There is plenty of global warming research out there which can not be dismissed as easily as a piece of entertainment, however. Back to the film, some of the dialogue was corny and badly put together...

eg when one guy says to the woman 'Friedrich Nietzsche was the most important thinker of the nineteenth century'

and she replies 'he was a chauvanistic pig who was in love with his sister'

then he says 'he was not a chauvanistic pig'

They should have left it like this with an uncomfortable silence (the joke being that he was not chavanistic but was incestuous), instead she replies 'he was in love with his sister' - ruins the joke. The homeless guy and his dog were lovable characters and added a spark of humanity needed to counterbalance the pampered preppie kids around them.

I enjoyed this film and recommend it to any potential viewers with the warning that they should enjoy it as a piece of entertainment and a warning about the possible dangers of global warming - but please don't equate the film with the scientific global warming argument!",1130803200,4,1615,4.57439446366782

1555386,1,B00005JMXX,"Ignore the on screen cyclonic ice storm causing a new ice age. The real disasters in this movie are the sensationalism, awful clichs, inane dialog, and gaping plot holes.

'The Day After Tomorrow' is such an awful movie, it really hurts the cause it trying to promote. It creates such a sensationalist and unrealistic storyline, even the most novice weather person would scoff at its veracity. This movie seems to say that by failing to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol (which was proposed 7 years before the movie came out), we are subject to an environmental catastrophe in less than a decade. If we only acted 7 years ago, we would be able to avert a complete change in global climate. Huh???

'The Day After Tomorrow' focuses so much on its message, it really ignores common sense. The Dick Cheney-like Veep ignores warnings, and tells a scientist to go pound sand about the Kyoto Protocol. Later, when things go south (pun intended), the Cheney-look alike says 'How could we have known?', to which the scientist said something to the effect of 'I tried to tell you.' So, it appears we could have averted global disaster if we only acted 7 years ago. Once again, this movie not only presents unrealistic scenarios, but unrealistic solutions as well.

The clichs are almost as bad as the message. After the tsunami destroys New York, and drowns hundreds of thousands of people, the Emmy Rossum character gently tells Jake Gyllenhall, 'thank you for saving my life...' Ugh! And lets not forget the comeuppance of the US, when it is time for Norte Americanos to cross *south* into Mexico. Who didn't see that one coming.

While I do not disagree with Roland Emmerich's ultimate argument about global warming, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is so unrealistic and sensationalist, that it is an embarrassment to environmentalism. The only thing going for it are the computer generated storms, tornados, and tsunamis laying waste to LA and New York.

The inclusion of the frozen mastodon was a nice touch!  Most everyone knows of the stories of instantly frozen mastodons with flowers in their mouths and this movie provided vivid realism of how instant freezing can occur.

1555457,1,B00005JMXX,"Hey everyone who believed the so-called ""science"" used for this movie, better think again.  I copied this article to show that most scientists and actual data do not support the crackpot ""greenhouse effect"".  You may not believe me but read for yourself.

Is the debate now over for skeptics of global warming hysteria? Readers of USA Today may certainly have that impression.

""Satellite and weather-balloon research released today removes a last bastion of scientific doubt about global warming, researchers say,"" reported USA Today on Aug. 12. 2005.
Certainly the USA Today report was partially correct - the researchers did, in fact, ""say"" [read ""claim""] that ""the last bastion of scientific doubt"" had been removed. But claims and reality often don't match up.

Three papers published in the journal Science last week purport to debunk an important argument advanced by skeptics of the notion of catastrophic, manmade global warming. The skeptics' argument is that while temperatures measured on the Earth's surface seem to indicate that global temperatures have increased at a rate of about 0.20 degrees Centigrade per decade (deg. C/decade) since the 1970s, temperatures measured in the atmosphere by satellite and weather balloons have shown only a relatively insignificant amount of warming for the same time period (about 0.09 deg. C/decade).

The implication of the skeptics' argument is that whatever warming seems to be happening on the Earth's surface, similar warming isn't happening in the atmosphere. This might mean that any observed surface warming is more likely due to the urban heat island effect -- where the heat-retaining properties of concrete and asphalt in urban areas artificially increase local temperatures -- rather than increasing atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.

One of the new Science studies reported that the satellites had drifted in orbit, causing errors in temperature measurement. Corrections to the satellite data, according to the researchers, would increase the atmospheric warming estimate to 0.19 deg. C/decade -- more in line with the 0.20 deg. C/decade warming of the Earth's surface. Another study reported that heating from tropical sunlight had skewed the balloon temperature measurements.

Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the studies' authors, told USA Today that, ""Once corrected, the satellite and balloon temperatures align with other surface and upper atmosphere measures, as well as climate change models.""
So is it really game-set-match in favor of the global warming alarmists? Not so fast, say the skeptics.

When University of Alabama-Huntsville researcher Roy Spencer, a prominent climatologist, factored the newly reported corrections into his calculations, his estimate of atmospheric warming was only 0.12 deg. C/decade -- higher than the prior estimate of 0.09 deg. C/decade, but well below the Science study estimate of 0.19 deg C/decade and the surface temperature estimate of 0.20 deg. C/decade.

As to the claimed errors in the weather balloon measurements, Spencer says that no other effort to adjust the balloon data has produced warming estimates as high as those reported in the new study and that it will take time for the research community to form opinions about whether the new adjustments advocated are justified.
Climate expert Dr. Fred Singer of the Science and Environmental Policy Project says the temperature adjustments are ""not a big deal.""

""Greenhouse theory says (and the models calculate) that the atmospheric trend should be 30 percent greater than the surface trend -- and it isn't,"" says Singer. ""Furthermore, the models predict that polar [temperature] trends should greatly exceed the tropical values -- and they clearly don't ... In fact, the Antarctic has been cooling,"" adds Singer.
Singer also had some related thoughts concerning the gloom-and-doom forecasts concerning future temperatures.

Last January, a study in the journal Nature estimated that a doubling of atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide would increase global temperatures anywhere from 1.9 degrees Centigrade to 11.5 degrees Centigrade by mid-century. But Singer says the researchers ""varied only six out of many more parameters necessary to model clouds... Their result confirms... that clouds are still too difficult to model and that climate models underlying the Kyoto Protocol have never been validated.""

So it's far from ""case-closed"" on global warming skepticism. Moreover, aside from the controversy over the satellite and weather balloon data, many key climate questions remain unanswered including: whether humans are causing significant warming; whether warming is undesirable; and whether anything be done to avert any undesirable warming.
Because of its prohibitive costs, alarm over global warming has been rejected numerous times by President Bush and the U.S. Senate. European nations are already discovering that their economies can't live with the Kyoto Protocol that was just implemented in February.

Despite alarmist media reports, global warming-mania is melting. It's no wonder the alarmists are in such a hurry to close the book on the science.

Recent films (War of the Worlds, Lord of the Rings, The Island) have shown us that special effects can be used to augment good storytelling to make compelling films.

In this case however, the effects stand alone, and there aren't nearly enough of them. There are probably a grand total of 10 minutes of ""shock and awe"" time in this movie, worth catching on HD HBO, but certainly not worth the price of a DVD or movie ticket.

The actors are not to blame here, Quaid, Holm,and Gyllenhall clearly did what they were asked. However the story and dialogue are so flat I never particularly cared what happened to any of the characters.

This is the scenario in ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" when the earth finally gives up on human civilization with the melting of the polar ice caps, a result of years of global warming. The lack of saltwater, after the melting, causes a chain of catastrophic weather events including tornadoes in Los Angeles, flooding in New York and an aproaching Ice Age for the entire northern hemisphere.

Who can save the day? Dennis Quaid plays Professor Hill, a climatologist employed by the U.S. government. He has been predicting such chaos for a while now, to the doubts of the President and his cabinet. He must now convince the U.S. government to evacuate every citizen in the southern United States to safe Mexico. Unfortunately, those in the northern United States cannot be saved, as the paralyzing cold creeps quickly in their direction.

Also, Professor Hill's son is trapped in New York and will die a freezing death in a short matter of time if he is not saved. Can Professor Hill convince the President to save as many Americans as possible by evacuating? Can he reach his son in time? Can human life survive another Ice Age - one that they created?

1555606,3,B00005JMXX,"this would be a great drive-in movie.  The plot is so simplistic that you could watch the first few minutes and know pretty much everything that will happen.

The story (such as it is) centers on paleoclimatologist (Dennis Quaid).  He has found evidence that there will be a massive climatic change soon, sometime between the next 100 to 1000 years.  He tries to explain to the incredibly dense government officals just how global warming could trigger an ice age and why action needed to be taken now.  Of course he is ignored and returns to his neglected family, his dedicated physician wife and his brilliant teenage son.  Naturally the catastrophe developes much sooner than he had predicted, like just after he had sent his son on a trip to New York which is naturally right in harm's way.  The remainder of the film is how humanity in general and this family in particular cope with the disaster.

This is as inane as most disaster films but the special effects are excellent.

The extra features are some deleted scenes, commentaries and a choice of Spanish or French dubbing (which could make this an interesting way to practice a foreign language), but nothing out of the ordinary.

There is something horrific about his screen presence that makes me want to take him ""not seriously"" Within this blockbuster,there lies a love story. It had to be because the director was too busy trying to be a Word Wide Hit. I'll excuse that and move on.

Sam Hall played by Mr. Whoever was quite nonsensical. Reason,he's 17 and is supposed to be some sort of genius. To me he was sleep inducing. I actually slept after 50 mins of this film and watched it the next morning the second part. The reason for that was that I didn't quite feel what the film maker wanted the viewer to feel.

The best two scenes in the film - the ones when the wolf jumped for SAM HALL (Mr. Whoever) I only wish he caught him and bit him off. I wouldnt have had to visit the worst father-son relationship story in a film ever.
Second fav.scene in the film I liked was the one where the Statue of Liberty was over taken by an ocean. Come on! That was just plain awesome.

I live in New Delhi and I only wonder if my country looked like that. No seriously,I enjoyed the 130 second attention they paid to it. I think half way down the movie the director changed the script. The President dies and no scene based on that is shown. I mean, they show some idiot on the tv being dragged away but not the President of USA.

Not in story or plot, but in the way that the movie can be so enjoyable and make little sense when it comes to science and common sense.  The movie is loosely based on the book THE COMING OF THE GLOBAL SUPERSTORM and concerns massive climate changes and how they affect life as we know it.

The movie begins on an ice shelf where a climatologist is taking core samples.  These samples combined with events on the shelf drive the scientist (Quaid) to hypothesize that a new ice age is in the near future unless we change our ways now.  To keep things movie, Quad is wrong on the time frame and things begin happening very quickly and drastically.  Like ID4, we follow a number of groups as they are affected by the events, especially Quaid and his almost estranged family.

Typical of this type of film, politics and politicians are painted as bad guys although some do come to their senses.  The action never lets up and the special effects are absolutely stunning.

The escaped wolves prowling the streets of The Big Apple were a nice touch too.  Ice Age here we come!

I cannot believe how bad the acting and dialog is in this one.  Dennis Quaid is a good actor, but I guess his Yacht payment was due the month he made this film; nothing else explains why he would agree to star in a turkey like this.

This is a flimsy, politically correct end of the world flick.  To the limited extent it is worth seeing, watch it for the special effects.  I don't know but that this flick would be a better viewing experience with the sound turned off.  The cheesy dialog is nothing but a distraction anyway.

1555664,3,B00005JMXX,"Here's the most well-designed disaster film since ""The Core"" that is long on looks and, well, lean as sizzlean on plot, acting and credibility.

Maybe something can happen in the world to return us to another ice age, but can it happen in 15 minutes time? That is essentially the plot of this disaster film, which contains a lot of great computer-generated scenes of natural disasters mixed in with a little real life footage you will easily recognize if you've ever watched any TV program about natural disasters.

Dennis Quaid is the star of this flick, whose disaster scenario builds around his quest to travel from Washington D.C. to New York to save his son, who is stranded in the city. Quaid and crew overcome a storm of the world and make it to New York, just in time to save the kid and a few others, who give hope that the end of the world -- which has essentially already happened -- can be reversed.

Optimism after the beginning of a new ice age? That's what we're faced with at the end of this movie, a rather surrealisitc premise on which to base a ""Day After Tomorrow 2"". My wife and I had a lot of laughs in this movie for the effects and precarious situations of the actors. I don't get the impression the film was supposed to be a comedy, so I have to assume it was not completely successful in its premise.

So don't expect too much from this when you it home and turned on in your DVD player. The scenes of tornadoes are not particularly realistic but they are sure big! The ocean rise that sweeps New York is more compelling but still bigger than anything that's ever been known to happen in reality, including the recent tsunami in the Indian Ocean.",1116201600,2,1672,4.4188311688311686
1555665,4,B00005JMXX,"If you are looking for a movie that's a feast for your eyes, then look no further.  The special effects within The Day After Tomorrow is one of the most gorgeous I've ever seen.  From the subtle hail storms in Tokyo to the tornadoes in Los Angeles, from the freezing blizzard in Scotland to the great flood and the aftermath of the catastrophe in New York City, every scene will leave you breathless.

Now for the negatives.  To be honest, this movie was probably never made with the intention of having people sceond guess the plot or figure out what is going on, so if you are looking for a philosophical, intellectual type of end of the world movie, you will not find it here.  I can't say the movie was crystal clear, but most of the plots were highly predictable, and the few parts that they did try to make it into something, it doesn't really contribute that much to the movie.  It just flowed like a beautiful picture book, but with few words or substance in it.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great story, just not one that you need to ponder about or second guess the plotlines.

It's a fantastic movie for younger viewers, but due to its lack of substance, sophisticated adults will likely find it lacks a certain charm that makes a movie a classic.  None the less, I still think it's worth a buy for movie(DVD) collectors (like me) because it's just too beautiful of a motion picture to pass up.",1116115200,3,1410,4.413127413127413
1555666,3,B00005JMXX,"Like a spoiled little brat having a temper tantrum in his overstuffed playroom, Roland Emmerich loves to destroy things - only he does so on a scale far beyond the dreams of even the most literal-minded schoolboy.  Cars, buildings, national monuments, whole cities - nothing is too grand or sacrosanct that it can't be reduced to rubble in the filmmaker's quest for the almighty buck.  He began his assault on the planet and audience sensibilities back in 1996 with ""Independence Day,"" in which he used aliens from outer space to do his dirty work for him.  Two years later, in ""Godzilla,"" he resurrected a campy cultural icon to smash New York City into tiny little pieces for our pleasure and edification.  Now, in ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" Emmerich has gone for the gold by having Mother Nature herself - as the ultimate woman scorned - pushing humanity to the brink of extinction as payment for our sin of casual indifference to the ecologically-sensitive world around us.  This is mass-market filmmaking with a social conscience.

""The Day After Tomorrow"" is what people generally have in mind when they refer to ""mindless summertime popcorn entertainment"" - a big-budget disaster picture with state-of-the-art special effects, minimalist plotting and wafer-thin characterizations.  This current vision of worldwide apocalypse shows what happens when mankind fails to heed the warnings of global warming: storms of unprecedented scope and ferocity are unleashed on major metropolitan areas in the Northern Hemisphere and a new ice age begins.  The Chicken Little of the piece is one Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a climatologist who can't get anyone to listen to his dire predictions for the future until it's too late and the sky has literally fallen in.  The ""plot"" involves Jack setting off on a suicide mission to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and some of his classmates who have been entombed in a snow- and ice-bound New York City.

As a storyteller, Emmerich pays a price for his pedantry and social crusading, failing to provide the kind of dramatic arc that turned ""Independence Day"" into such a rabble-rousing entertainment.  In ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" once the destruction of LA and Manhattan have been effectively dramatized - the former by tornadoes and the latter by a tidal wave-cum-blizzard - the film lapses into a mundane narrative pattern, so that the final hour or so consists of little more than people trudging through the snow trying to stay warm.  The film turns out to be almost all build-up with very little pay off.  Nevertheless, some of the imagery is indeed fantastic, especially that of the skyline of New York City literally frozen under a coating of ice and snow.  The characters barely register as people and we really don`t care what happens to any of them, but there's still an irresistible pull to much of the film, particularly in the first half, mainly because it shows us how very vulnerable we are to the great natural forces that rule our planet.  The movie makes us feel as if we are mere guests in this world, being allowed to exist here only by the grace and whim of a power that - either through malice or fatal indifference - could wipe us out in no time flat.

""The Day After Tomorrow"" is the movie equivalent of a 50-car pileup.  You know there's nothing particularly edifying to be gained by watching it, but you can't help looking at it anyway.  You can con yourself into believing that you're studying it as a warning against unsafe driving when, deep down inside, you know that what is really holding your attention is all that destruction and carnage.  So it is with this movie.  The salutary environmental message is really only the pretext for watching the human race get a first-class ass-whippin`.

1555755,5,B00005JMXX,"Out of the many movies I have seen throughout my lifetime, this is one of the best.  I don't think it was because of the plot, but instead for its mind-blowing special effects and its interesting take on the last day or ""apocalypse.""  I am not a very religious person, but after watching this film, I was starting to think maybe I should take it up...or make a note never to live in New York.

The film is about a climatologist named Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid, Flight of the Phoenix) who predicts that Global Warming (the Greenhouse Effect) is going to trigger a new Ice Age.  Everyone refuses to believe him until its too late.  Now Jack, his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal, October Sky), and a small band of survivors must ride out this super-storm and survive the wrath of Mother Nature.

 The number one reason why everyone should go see this film is because the visual effects are phenomenal!  They are more detailed and meticulously played out than in any other film to this day.  The makers of this film took a sequence of events that could quite possibly have happened within thousands of years and tried to figure out what would happen if the process was sped up to fit in a two hour time slot.  I also think that the visual effects are even better than those in Lord of the Rings (like the huge computerized battle scenes).  To get the maximum effect of these ingenious visual effects, watch the film with the surround sound blasting and with widescreen if your TV can handle it.

 The plot for this movie is average.  It is basically about Jack going to rescue his son Sam who is caught in the super-storm in New York and with his girlfriend Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum, The Phantom of the Opera), which is very sweet of Jack...if it were possible to travel on foot against Mother Nature's wrath...but then again if everybody died in the movie, it would only be a half hour film.  By keeping a few main characters alive, it helped the audience to see what it would be like to have no choice but to live and coup under such extreme conditions.  Aside from the plot, the actors' speaking parts are pretty limited and underdeveloped as well.  Perhaps because everyone's either: screaming, dying, or too shocked to say anything throughout the film.  I think the main reason why the plot and speaking parts were so underdeveloped was because too much time was spent on perfecting the special effects that not enough time was left to spend on making a better and more detailed plot for the accomplished actors/actresses in the film.  Maybe someday a movie will be made that has both breathtaking special effects AND an equally extraordinary plot.

 I loved this movie's take on a second Ice Age, or mini ""apocalypse,"" as well.  For instance, it talked about how an enormous hurricane/tornado, whose eye covered the entire U.S., was so powerful that it sucked in air from outer space and dumped it onto the states, instantly freezing everything.  This and the other types of natural destruction were displayed throughout the movie. They all got me thinking about how much damage Americans cause towards our ozone every day.  I think it is highly probable that global warming will occur in the near future if we continue to abuse our privileges here on Earth.  It's pretty scary stuff when you think about it, so if you're looking for a good conversation starter, watch this movie and fear Mother Nature!

 In other words, The Day After Tomorrow is a technological masterpiece that really delivers.  It was directed by Roland Emmerich (creator of the hit movie: Independence Day) and made over $900 million worldwide!  So why not watch this excellent big-budget film and see the new face on entertainment for yourself?",1113350400,4,3712,4.685185185185185
1555756,3,B00005JMXX,"Tidal waves!! Tornadoes!! Hail storms!! Sounds like another CNN news line-up. No, not really. It's Roland Emmerich's latest disaster flick.

The movie's premise can be summed up in one sentence: five huge, hurricane-like cold fronts are forming and are about to cover the equator of the world, bringing about severe weather that render humans helpless. Oh yeah, Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, and his girlfriend are in the middle of it all.

The story is mediochre at its best (something about the whole global warming hoopla, family drama, and other ridiculous subplots). I didn't really care about the characters throughout most of the film and that's a big drawback. Basically, they're just there to interact with the storm, which are the real stars of the movie. Talent is wasted here, especially with Gyllenhall and Sela Ward. I KNOW they can do better.

What saves this disaster is the excellent special effects, which seems to be Emmerich's trend anyway. The tornado that wrecks havoc in Los Angeles is pure eye candy. In my opinion, that span of fifteen or so minutes top the one-hour-plus of New York being pummeled by both a tidal wave and an Ice Age.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes cheesy disaster movies from the 70's, like Hurricane. Don't expect it to be a Poseidon Adventure or Earthquake.",1112918400,3,1323,4.9192825112107625
1555757,1,B00005JMXX,"Sometimes a movie is so bad that it is actually fun to watch . . like THE BLOB or INDEPENDENCE DAY . . . but this one has nothing to save it.  Full of clichs, including a Cheney-like VP, global warming presented as absolutely the origin of the disaster, the good guys surviving . . . something resembling credibility was needed and was missing.  Even the ""special effects"" were not special.  Don't waste your time on this one.",1111708800,,426,4.435897435897436
1555758,2,B00005JMXX,"But the special effects showing destruction and massive storm scenes make this poorly contrived movie almost worth watching.  Taking as the premise for the movie the hypothesis that melting ice cap in the north pole will redirect the gulf stream causing the rapid onslaught of a catastrophic drop of temperature in the northern hemisphere.  Even those scientists who find the gulf stream model plausible, will laugh themselves silly watching this movie.  The idea of some super-cold hurricanes creating a deep freeze up north is decidedly about as dorky and unscientific as young earth creationism.

The plot, if you can call it that has Dennis Quaid playing a scientist whose warnings are ignored by the evil Vice President who looks a bit similar to that former head and current patron of Halliburton.  His son and his romantic interest are in New York for a contest and get stranded by the poor weather.  Lots of disaster scenes take place as storm swells take the Atlantic Ocean inland accross Manhattan.  Ultimately, Quaid tries to save his son.  Holed up in the library, rather than burn the wood furniture that lies all around, these geniuses start burning books including a Guttenberg Bible.  Now here is the fun part.  The front side of this hurricane manages get through Manhattan without too much severe cold, but after the eye of the storm appears, somehow they learn that a super chill is going to come with the back side of the storm.  I guess that swirling mass has different temperatures on either side of the storm.  Beam me up Scotty, because beaming up my particles make more sense than that.

In short, this movie has some cool special effects.  You might have to totally turn off your brain to like this movie, though I have to admit watching Mexico trying to close their border to fleeing Americans was good for a laugh.  The ending has the newly inspired Vice President giving a very lame speech about environmental responsibility.  Pretty dumb.

1555760,3,B00005JMXX,"The global warming phenomenon, as explained by scientists, has already resulted in changes to the Earth's climate, and these effects will likely continue over the next 100 or so years.  In many ways, our goose is already cooked, due to the high levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases already released into the atmosphere during the past century.  We're making some progress now, but how much of a difference it will make is open to question.  Relative to energy output, emissions have already been scaled back, and more dramatic changes in transportation, power generation and even the components of buildings are taking place designed to reduce emissions further.  Against this progress is the fact of rapid industrialization and growing Third World development (and thus growing demand for the kinds of things we in the U.S. take for granted, like personal automobiles and larger refrigerators), particularly in two of the world's biggest nations, China and India--countries that were inexplicably left out of the Kyoto accords, rendering them meaningless. The other problem for environmentalists about the global warming issue is that the only practical way to accomplish Kyoto globally--or to go farther--is via the wider application of nuclear power, which is emission-free.  At which point, some of us say, hmmm, maybe milder winters in Canada might not be so bad.

Unless Dick Cheney has been secretly alive for 120 years, and exerting unseen powers from his undisclosed location, however, he is not the villain of global warming. He is merely one of thousands of stooges for the energy industry since the first crude was pumped from Pennsylvania soil.

""The Day After Tomorrow,"" however, casts a Cheney-like figure in the role of villain, responsible for the deaths of perhaps tens of millions of people during a bad few days during which the majority of the Northern Hemisphere gets frozen stiff, all because Cheney is too close to the energy industry.  What is worse is the embarrassing science depicted here. The film wants to raise consciousness about global warming, and instead discredits the theory by turning it into a premise not unlike a 50s science fiction flick.

The acting of Dennis Quaid, as the bold scientist who repeatedly insults Dick Cheney and is thus ignored, Sela Ward as his saintly wife, and Jake Gyllenhall as his shy genius son, is all terrible, but it's probably not their fault given the sappy dialogue they have to utter. The emotional payoff of this movie is that Jake's character gets a girl to like him, although both remain virgins throughout.

Why does this idiotic movie deserve three stars?  As everyone else has said, the CG special effects are satisfyingly vivid and destructive. The scenes of powerful tornados destroying Los Angeles, the rising waters swamping Manhattan, the mango-sized hail in Tokyo, and the flashfreezing of almost everyplace in the northern hemisphere--yeah! Even better than the aliens blowing up the White House in ""Independence Day."" That's what this movie's all about.  I hope it leads to a new era of ultra-CG apocalyptic sci-fi, the dumber the better!  But, directors, please leave important issues like global warming out of it.",1111622400,6,3227,5.159003831417625

This movie is full of great action/disaster scenes. It also has a surprisingly good score by Harold Klauser, ""a composer who is not that well known."" I am used to hearing David Arnold scores on Emmerich's movies, but Klauser has proven himself to be a worthy oppenent. Also, Dennis Quaid does a wonderful job portraying the scientists who nobody believes. In fact, all the actors do a splendid job!

The Story is all about global cataclysm climate disaster, or mother nature returning the favour of sucking her dry of natrual resources - indeed. The start of the film throws us straight in  the deep end, news reports of indians walking in a winter wonderland, the collapsing antartic and basically terrible weather everywhere. The general humanising (making it as if real people are in it - what we would do in other words) is extrememly acurate, even for the americans, bless them. The Day After Tommorow generally sums up our way of life, humans. We only seem to care about ourselves and fellow humans, if there is a super disaster then WE have to survive, as long as WE have fuel WE are fine, the American president (actually the vice presiident for some reason) is bush and Clinton rolled into one, denying the coming storm, ""Our economey is just as fragile as the enviroment"", which is dead short sited - BUSH IF YOUR READING THIS, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT - - GIT.",1110844800,3,1163,4.640776699029126

Dennis Quaid stars as a climatologist who knows his stuff...and based upon information received from his colleagues around the globe, determines that the massive storms and temperature changes that the world has been experiencing is ushering in another ice age.  Predictably, he battles with US politicians in an effort to save as many as his countrymen as possible--finally convincing the president to evacuate all southern US states to Mexico (talk about a twist of fate), explaining that all is lost for folks currently in the northern US states.  Unfortunately for Mr. Quaid, his son is among the ""lost"".....on a school trip with fellow brainiacs in New York City.

Storyline to make one sit back and take stock upon the many ways we abuse our beloved Earth.  Is the science plausible..?  Who knows?  Who cares?  The special effect are awesome, the scenes are riveting, and the carnage is visited upon those most deserving...sparing our ""Third World"" brethren.

1555832,5,B00005JMXX,"If President George W Bush did not watch Fahrenheit 911, then we sure hope he accidentally sneaked into Screen #2 to watch that `action looking one' instead. ""The Day After"" (1983) (TV) was the original frightening story about the weeks before, during and after a nuclear strike on the United States with the human factor in Lawrence, Kansas. We where all made watch it and it did frighten us. In fact it scared the Jesus out of most of us. It has taken over twenty years for something as realistically possible as ""The Day After"" to emerge... and it has a similar name, ""The Day After Tomorrow"", so I have no doubt that the producers and writers of the show probably understand quite well that they are delivering on something just as important as the first one. In other words I see this as the new remake and it is a perfectly bona-fide real world problem issue.

The Day After Tomorrow, is the new `fear the atom bomb' pseudo-documentary science-based live action movie about a real global threat to humanity, this time instead of radiation and nuclear fallout, the message is not even terrorism as the current political model would have us believe, but an environmental catastrophe because of GLOBAL WARMING, The Day After Tomorrow goes at great length to tell us that science predicts these changes to quickly occur and in such rapid succession that there will be an international emergency, in other words we will wait until the last possible second to address the issues at hand, as we are still doing now in 2005, even after a massive tidal wave just wiped out a huge segment of the Far East's population, including many holiday makers, imagine how many more if this had been during the summer period for westerners? It is our duty to stop pretending this is someone else's problem. Nobody will shoot you for becoming a hippy and changing your job style to something a little more on the green side. You are going to have to be doing that anyway in 27 years time when all the oil is gone. Oh yeah and if you look into perpetual motion, free energy systems and hydrogen fuel you can see how problematic things are really going to get.

As for the movie, well next to ""Spider-man 2"" and the new ""Appleseed"" this has some of the best special effects you have ever seen, and really you should watch it for that, some very interesting border activity (why weren't the Mexican immigration and army just popping them all off with sniper riffles really makes you think what probably would have gone on there dude!), funny CGI wolves that sometimes work and then sometimes don't, the plot is almost Independence Day over again except for all the patriotic chest-beating, you have seen much of the flooding before in ""Deep Impact"", even the back story of Dennis Quaid making his way to New York to find his missing son is hooky, Ian Holmes character the only sense of a real person, the environmental disaster is what you believe in, not necessarily the plot, a five star film because it gets an important message across loud and clear, we can not go on living like we are as a world of energy wasting polluters without receiving some payback.",1110412800,7,3142,4.629032258064516

Yes...we actually paid to see this alleged-movie...not monopoly money either....real American dollars.

We had imagined it would be one of those eerie end of the world type movies like ""The Day After"" from the 1980's.

""The Day After"" was a well conceived, chilling, way-too-realistic movie with real world class actors that left an indelible impression on any of us who remember seeing it.

This alleged-movie though...""The Day after Tomorrow"" left an even greater impression.

It was...and I am searching for adjectives here...which is rare for me...one of the most abysmal...pathetic...wretched...laughable -only in the sense that I am not prone to crying in public theaters-...bottom of the barrel--collection of whacko liberalism disguised as a film that I have ever witnessed.

If there was not within me such a deep and compelling inner desire to forget that I had ever seen this pathetic collection of scenes...then there could have been the possibility that some of the lines from it may have become cult classics.

Yet I can't quote any as I have forced myself to go into denial that I ever was one of those who attended it.

#1 The acting is just about as bad as acting is going to get. It is the...what would the opposite of the Gold standard be...??....

It's as if Dennis Quaid studied the worst Sci-Fi flicks of the 1950's and said to himself...""I know the acting in those films was often bad...but it was so bad that it worked and became beloved...not my performance...I am going to act really terrible in a way that people will find irritating and repulsive!""

He Succeeded!!!!!!!

All of the acting is pathetic to the point that you feel as if you are watching an SNL sketch...a parody of the actual alleged-movie...and then it dawns on you that some bunch of knot heads actually released this in theaters!

Was it angry actors doing bad parody...or bad actors doing angry parody...or was it humans pretending to be bad actors actually doing bad parody?

Questions that possibly no mortal can answer!

The special effects are very neat and impressive, although they are diminished...in the realm of disbelief that your brain is signaling you on as to what complete paranoid lunacy is existing in place of a plot.

Did I comment on how bad Dennis Quaid was????

If not...Dennis Quaid was really bad!!!!

He had a look on his face the whole time as if he were being forced to smell chicken manure.

I saw the same look on the faces of people in the theater so it may have been an honest reaction to the accumulated words that someone conned off as a script!

Really now...how many homeless, cart pushing folks do you think are wandering around New York or Atlanta saying stuff like....""All these people in these gas sucking SUV's...putting out all these fumes killing the ozone with these terrible internal combustion engines...blah...blah...blah...

Every homeless person who has ever approached me in Atlanta wants .50 cents or a cigarette!

Okay next time YOU are in Atlanta and a homeless person pushing a cart with a bag on his head comes up to YOU and wants .50, then tell him, ""I'll give you a buck if you tell me what you think of the internal combustion engine!""

Write me back with that reply.

Oh come on!!!!!!! That borders on Monty Pythonish language which is funny if you look at it in that light...but there is dialogue in just about every scene which is just not even vaguely believable.

One last thing...if this propaganda....thing...I can't call it a Film...if it was intended to be an alleged-film version of what goes on inside the dark corridors of Al Gores head...as many are aware of his unhindered, outspoken endorsement and involvement with this...ugh....project....then President Clinton must have had more to deal with than any of us ever knew.

Maybe some of us were way too hard on Clinton.

The Vice presidential figure in the alleged-movie was a virtual duplicate (body and face and demeanor) of Vice President Cheney.

The seething contempt that the alleged-movie makers had for Vice President Cheney cast a dark shadow over the film that actually backfired as the film progressed.

I heard a man behind me say (many folks began to talk to themselves out loud as the project progressed) ""Dang...I'm beginning to like Cheney more than I ever thought possible!""

You can say what you want about Joseph Goebbels...he was a racist, a Jew Hater, a Christian Hater, an Atheist, a liar, and a suicidal maniac......but that said,  he did commission some ghoulish but effective propaganda films.

Who knows...maybe it actually takes real talent to so ferociously mangle and neuter propaganda to this degree!

One encouraging note for whoever the Czar is who gave approval to this project...It did sort of succeed as a comedy.

By the end of the show the audience was regularly laughing and often squealing at some of the most serious parts of the alleged-movie.

Melodrama had morphed into dark comedy...

1555955,5,B00005JMXX,"From the start, I have always loved this film. I only heard about it three days before it was supposed to come out on a preview, or else I would've never seen it. It seemed pretty neat to see the worlds weather go crazy, and also fairly original, but what one of the things I liked most about the film is that it gives an explanation of what was happening, and what could very well be happening in our near future.

When Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his two partners are in the artic taking ice samples from Shelf B of the great ice glaciers, the whole shelf, the size of Rhode Island, suddenly breaks off. Not just because of this one shelf, but because of thousands of other glaciers melting and disrupting the flow of the nothern current, which depends on a balance of salt water and fresh water, these glaciers have caused an imbalance of fresh water, sending the earth into a weatherful and deadly apocalypse.

Wtih tornadoes plowing through LA, baseball sized hail crashing through Tokyo, huge hurricane-like storms that freeze instead of rain, and below 100 degree temperatures, Jack must save his 17 year old son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is caught in New York with his friends, from the eye of the storm before he and Sam fall victim to the day after tomorrow.

The fact that Shelf B in Antartica really did break off while they were writing the script, and wrote it into the movie was pretty scary. The fact that everything was pretty believable in the story made it good also. It doesn't get confusing, and nothing is ever left unexplained, except maybe why the ice storms which looked a lot like hurricanes were the most dangerous in the eye of the storm instead of safe, but it's easy to figure out. It gets so intensely cold in the eye of the storm for those types of storms that not even clouds can form there, and that also made a lot of sense.

Before I saw it, I figured it would be like every other single apocalypse film, like Armageddon, or The Core, is that they would eventually correct the problem in the end. This made it all the better that they didn't, and of course, in hollywood, they can do anything, but it's better that they didn't, or else I wouldn't have given this film even 3 stars. It's always better when you know the danger is still there, and it hasn't ended.

I think what drew people to The day after tomorrow more than to other apocalyptic films mentioned above is that the events in the other movies aren't caused by us, they just happen somewhere along the line in the movies in a random place. The Day After Tomorrow was caused by us with the pollution we cause everyday by just driving to work or school, and might actually happen any time soon. Where I used to live in Arizona was around 96 degrees high in the summer when I was three and the pollution was moderate. Now that I'm fourteen and we've moved out of Arizona the pollution is so bad you can't even see the buildings, and now the high is up to 120 degrees!

To the quality of the movie, the acting was okay by the major actors, but seriously, the best acting came from the co-stars, or the ones that aren't exactly known yet like Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, and Tamlyn Tomita. Jake Gyllenhaal was good, but Dennis Quaid just didn't do as well as anticipated. The visuals are awesome, though. For anyone who didn't like the storyline or the movie itself cannot deny how good the action is when the storms get ready for their destruction. The freezing scenes are great, and everything is just amazing about this film in my opinion. You'll never look at the weather the same way again.",1107302400,5,3588,4.445288753799392

1556024,3,B00005JMXX,"Day After Tomorrow is a great film in the visual sense. It uses all sorts of excellent special effects to make it look like the planet Earth is about to be overtaken by weather- related disasters. But aside from the great special effects work, this film is really nothing special.

Dennis Quaid is the main star in this film and, once again, his performance is only average. The other actors/actresses in the movie are also average. None of them delivers an Oscar- caliper performance, but none of them are really bad, either. In this area, the film gets a passing grade, but not by much.

The other problem I have with this movie is the plot itself. With a story like this- one of such Earth shattering, weather- related proportions- so much could have been done to make the movie more interesting and more entertaining. But the director, Roland Emmerich, decides instead to make the film rather dull and forgettable. To give you an idea, one of the major parts of the storyline involves Dennis Quaid heading for New York to find his son. All of these global weather changes are taking place all around and people are fighting for their lives and here's Dennis Quaid's character hiking through the snow to reach New York.

Political messages pop up all throughout this movie and I don't know if the director was trying to push a particular point of view or not, but it seems like he was. The topic of global warming and its potential to be a disaster, the subject of foreign debts owed to U.S. banks, and other political talk come up throughout the movie and it appears that Emmerich is trying to persuade viewers to take political action.

I recommend this movie, but only because of its great special effects. The rest of the film- the acting, plot, script, etc.- are average or below average. But watching those gigantic waves crashing through the streets of New York City makes this film worth a look.",1106784000,3,1906,4.646884272997033
1556025,4,B00005JMXX,"Disaster flicks! Probably the genre that has the most dichotomic following! Fans are usually fully fascinated. the rest of the cinema goers find the movies despicable.

This seems to be a basic phenomenon. Fascination (well beyond appraisal) or utter rejection.

What it means is that there are those of us who are indeed captivated by disaster flicks as by magic. And that group is not a minority! (if it were, the genre would have no commercial existence!).

All of you probably know people who love going out into a storm! Who crave lightning. Should you be interested in a more appropriate analysis of this intriguing behaviour, I suggest you read Velikovsky's ""Mankind in amnesia"". An eye-opener!

In a way, it is like being drawn to Disney fantasies or being repelled by them. Not the same group, but the same phenomenon!

The conclusion is that, once drawn into the disaster ""magic"" (pandsemonium is probably a better term), our sense of reality goes dormant, and we submit to the pressure of the events, revelling in them, coming to expect them and still being shocked by the occurrences. in other words, the overwhelming aspect takes precedence over the scientific realism.

Cinema makers have understood and encapsulate such an need into commercial (success) formulas: panic events, some human misery, unexpected heroism, narrow escapes and a happy ending (or at least a soothing one). The story in itself is totally irrelevant, better even: there is no need for a story! The formula, as expected, is made of a series of horrendous events of which the sequence is the sole required motor!

In that respect, ""the day after tomorrow"" serves the objective splendidly. It has the appropriate (very) bad news (irreversible climatic change: wow! What can you do against that?). The emotional bits (likable people being frozen to death). The make-believe objective: group of (also likable) people trapped inside the library, who are in need of being rescued, even more so as it become neigh impossible. the hero (scientist and father of one of the trapped kids) who will travel God knows how many miles, using some kind of sleigh. And all the cliffhangers are there as well.

At the level of acceptance by disaster fans, the whole thing works perfectly well. Visually splendid, correctly paced. So who cares about basic physical impossibilities? Who cares about the two-dimensional characters? Who cares about the flimsy story line?

I for one don't. I just recline in my seat and enjoy! It's the best thing to be in (for two hours), apart from the real disaster!",1106784000,3,2566,4.990632318501171

I really like this movie. I like the storyline, the acting, the ending, almost everything. The scene where the ocean is rising up around the Statue of Liberty and on to the city is one of the most awesome I have ever seen.

Elsewhere in other reviews you can get the storyline and other facts. I'm here because of that one niggling little gripe. For whatever reason, somebody decided ""We don need to use no stinkin' real wolves, we have ANIMATORS!""  Guys, what would it have cost you to go rent 4 freakin' wolves?! Nah. You spend a few million bucks on making a movie then do this.

The Day After Tomorrow

Here's how it ranked...

Sound: 3/5

Hmmm... Well, it had some music. Some music that was good at setting a mood, but honestly, I would never want to listen to that music by itself, and there were points when I felt the music was trying to coax me into feeling something that a scene just didn't deserve, so...

Graphics: 5/5

Yeah. The graphics were very good. Very expensive too, I would imagine.

Story Concept: 3.5/5

Well, it was tough for even someone like me to decypher it all, but the basic idea is that global warming and water pollution derail a temperature current and as a result, three continent-sized hurricanes go around flash-freezing everything. A concept like this would normally earn the movie a 4.5, but the majority of the movie is spent watching (you guessed it) people scurry around looking for one another and trying to escape this new ice age. It felt like an insect's eye view of the entire incident, and frankly, I found that kind of depressing.

Story Presentation: 3/5

Here we go. Well, the movie made a big deal of its central theme (global warming=ice age,) but that didn't really take up much time in the film. As I said, this scientist Jack and his kid Sam dominate most of the film. This is its central flaw, in my mind, since neither of them starts out as a terrible likable or human character and thus no matter how personal the movie gets with them, it doesn't increase the quality any. They weren't hateful characters, but they weren't all that human either. The director of this film proved he was excellent at depicting huge catastrophies and terrible at depicting rushed romances in Independence Day, and he reinforces that with this film, in which he manages a truly spectacular catastrophy and a truly cheesy romantic cameo that harkens back to a hundred other such cameo-appearance romances in older films. The speed with which the storms move about and do their work is not the least believable thing about the movie though. With your permission, I will go through a few points of interest.

Nearer to the beginning of the film, when the huge disasters start happening, and the kids get trapped after New York City is smashed into by a 50 foot wall of water, one of the kids finds a payphone which he says will work better than their cel-phones because it gets its power from the electrical lines. Now, my telephone goes out when there's a THUNDERSTORM, never mind a huge wall of water. One might argue that if a wall of water can smash in windows and toss busses, it can certainly knock out some telephone lines.

Secondly, a tanker of some sort finds its way into New York while it's flooded, with things on-board apparently written in Russian. I have no problem accepting that a Russian Tanker could be docked in New York's harbors. What bugs me is how it managed to weave its way in between those tall buildings without so much as a captain to guide it.

Third, later in the film, the kids get chased by a pack of wolves. Wolves. In New York. I suppose they could have escaped from the zoo or something, but then, shouldn't they have been followed by lions, tigers and bears (oh, my) and a few other interesting animals? The film tries to hint that they escaped from some kind of ""wolf kennel"" (yeah, right,) but we all know there are problems with that explanation. I think they just put the wolves in because New York was supposed to look like Alaska at that point, but the wolves just look suspicious in New York. Maybe they just took a cab in from Alaska or something.

The idea of global warming leading to a new ice age isn't at all tough to believe, but in half a week? Come on now. The idea that the President would be the last to leave the White House is a little less believable though.

Having said all that, the film's execution is not without a bit of pleasing irony. As people head south towards warmer climates, the mexican officials close the borders to the american immegrants. Classic. The fact that the bum in New York is the one with the most experience in staying alive in situations like the kind they get through in this film adds some charm too.

Acting: 4/5

Only a few examples of truly bad acting could be found in this movie. Mostly its problem was the execution.

All in All: 3.7/5

When I first heard of this movie, I thought that it wouldn't be a sci-fi. It was, but only because of the last totally-unbelievable circumstance this movie had to offer. Near the end, Dick Cheney (we're left to suppose it's him) tells the American people that he was wrong. We all know that no member of America's administration would ever admit to being wrong about something. They're more likely to say ""Who, me? I was against this whole 'global warming' thing from the start."" Still, this movie has the distinction of being one of the first movies to portray the northern hemisphere in a 3-day ice age, and parts of it, as I said, were quite enjoyable, so it deserves credit for that. This one you can decide whether you want to see it or not, but in my mind, it's not indespensible.",1106438400,,5264,4.49895178197065

1556031,2,B00005JMXX,"My wife and I have developed a new set of criteria about deciding when to go to the movies or not -- it's not about whether a movie is good or not, but whether it is a spectacle or not.  Basically, drama and emotions can show up just as well on a TV as they can on a big screen, but explosions and huge waves and large continents look much better when seen on a 60 foot screen.

So we went to see the Day After Tomorrow at the movie theater, and it didn't disappoint in that regard.  Seeing New York get its just desserts is always entertaining to non-New Yorkers, but some of this spectacle may be lost on the small screen, while none of the implausibility, trite dialogue, predictable action, or preachiness goes away.

This is good for a one-time viewing for the sheer spectacle, but about a third of a way into it, stop the DVD for a second, and predict what will happen to each of the characters.  If you've ever seen any disaster film before, you should be able to guess the rest of the plot with 100% accuracy.  You could have some fun by turning this predictability into a drinking game.

1556033,3,B00005JMXX,"The Day After Tomorrow had a very high budget. Clearly because of the eye-opening special effects. The plot is overthought. It is disturbing, though, especially now due to the effects of the Tsunami in Southeast Asia and so on. It is thouroughly depressing but is not exaggerated. Nothing that happened in it would not have happened in one of these kind of storms. So, therefore, nothing much is really called for by the actors. All of the performances are basic. I don't feel that the story really touched on an emotional level. But the special effects keeps the movie exciting. Though, if a storm like this hit and only those few people survived, that's farfetched. This is definitely a ride, but overall, just a movie that's fun to look at. If you're gonna get this, just make sure you get widescreen. It's much better because the visuals are more visual.",1106092800,2,858,4.726666666666667
1556083,4,B00005JMXX,"Certainly, it is yet another disaster movie, but we film-goers have a huge appetite for disasters.  The film makers will keep making them as long as we keep paying to watch them.  In my opinion some reviewers have been too harsh about this one.  It's not bad, as disaster movies go.  There are some very good special effects that save it from being the unworthy crock some people are suggesting.
In this film, the Northern hemisphere is covered by big, rotating clouds - there are 3 of them: one for Canada/USA, one for Europe and one for Siberia.  The heroes are American (of course) with a nod to a small knot of British climatologists (or meteorologists) shivering over their tea and biscuits in Scotland.  The warnings about possible climate change, brought about by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and hacking and burning forests, had been largely ignored by those in the strongest position to do something about it.  And now it's too late.  The switch to colder global temperatures has been flipped.  The genii is out of the bottle and cannot be put back.  The course of events is inexorable.  The polar ice begins to melt at an alarming rate.  The Atlantic conveyor (the ocean current that carries warm water to the cold regions where it gets all cold and salty so that it sinks and flows back to the warmer regions) is altered when a critical desalination point is reached.  Climate stability is lost.  There are huge storms - unseasonable and in unexpected places.  Great flocks of birds fill the sky over New York - a portent of doom - flying south.  A huge dome of ocean crashes over Manhattan.  Those who survive the drowning are subjected to blizzards and rapid freezing.  Wolves stalk the streets.  People who are able to, flee south, where they find the Mexican border closed to them.  It all looks pretty grim.  There's been a sudden catastrophic climate change and the planet is plunged into a new ice age.
The quality of the cinematography and CGI, as good as they are, don't make a good story unnecessary, but they still help the film to be very enjoyable despite a high degree of schmaltz.  The wolves are obviously computer generated (just as well because one of them gets a series of vicious clouts with a torch and a couple of them have bone-crushing collisions with walls and doors) but the flocks of birds and the movement of water, snow and ice are very realistic. The acting and the dialogue are not bad but the human interest element of the story really is a bit sickly.  Now that I've watched the film a few times, I find I just skip all the emotional goo and go straight to the entertaining parts - mostly the special effects.  Examples that impressed and entertained me (the sort of clips they show on the trailers):
 the breaking off of the Larsen B Antarctic ice shelf
 the rash of tornados tearing Los Angeles apart
 the huge wave that crashed over the statue of liberty and into New York
 the quick freeze flag
 the discovery in the library of a section of publications on tax law that nobody - not even the most devoted bibliophile - would mind burning in order to keep warm
There are a few extras.  The commentaries are fairly interesting.  The trailers are useful.  I now know that I want to see ""I Robot"" and also ""Alien vs. Predator"" looks interesting though we only see the 'creature workshop' and not any part of the film.  The menu programme on this single disc edition is not too good.  If you press the menu button, instead of going back to the menu, as happens with most DVDs, this takes you straight back to the interminable warnings about pirating films and you can't skip them.  So best not to press the menu button if you just wanted to select a different scene for example.  On balance, I think this is an entertaining film and well worth the price.

1556087,3,B00005JMXX,"A film by Roland Emmerich

Yes, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is the latest in a long tradition of disaster movies and it managed to spawn the rather dreadful television movie ""Category Six"".  The premise here is that after decades (centuries, even) of devastating the environment through industry the world is facing a climate shift.  Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a scientist who has been warning anyone who will listen that we have to start thinking about the future right now and not leave the Earth a worse mess for future generations to deal with after it is too late.  Hall believes that similar, severe climate shifts have happened several times throughout the history of this planet.  In Jack's prediction, however, he admits that this may be decades if not centuries away.  For there to be any sort of a movie, however, we know that this drastic climate shift is about to happen in the immediate future.

Jack Hall is dismissed by the Dick Cheney look-a-like Vice President, but from the beginning of the movie we have been seeing some strange weather.  The air temperature dropped so quickly over Scotland that helicopters little froze in midair and dropped.  The pilots also physically froze in place.  Maybe cryogenics will be able to help them out in the future.  Likewise, there are reports of bizarre weather all over the planet and it is becoming apparent that something is very wrong.  Not too far into the movie government officials start believing Jack and have Jack and his staff work out a forecast model for what this storm is going to do.  The only potential forecast that Jack has is what he believes happened tens of thousands of years ago.  With this forecast he sees that the climate shift is going to be harsher and quicker than anyone would imagine possible.

""The Day After Tomorrow"" is not just about death and destruction and pretty special effects, but there is a side-story revolving around his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam is a high school student and is incredibly bright.  He is in New York City for some sort of a Quiz Bowl Championship.  On his team is a girl he is very interested in named Laura (Emmy Rossum), but he is too shy/scared to talk about his feelings for her.  When the climate shift occurs, they are trapped in New York after the city floods, then freezes.  From talking to his father, Sam knows that the deep freeze which knocked out the helicopters is headed for New York and anyone caught outside will not survive it.

As good of a job as Emmy Rossum did in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" she is given nothing to do here other than be the love interest of Sam, and this entire subplot is unnecessary.  Honestly, most viewers know that these disaster movies are never very good, but we watch them to see wanton destruction and some special effects.  Surprisingly, the discussion about what is going on with the weather is actually interesting and is one of the better parts about the movie.  I think it is because the characters are taking the issue seriously and there is nothing campy or horribly unrealistic about it.  If the absurd is taken seriously, the absurd becomes believable.  But even that pales in the absurdity of Jack trying to travel from Washington D.C. to New York City to rescue Sam after the Climate Shift and before the Hard Freeze.  That part is just too absurd for words.

Dennis Quaid is a very good actor and his work puts this whole discussion into the realm of the believability, and I have been enjoying his recent work since ""The Rookie"".  Gyllenhaal is a bit old for his role here, but he is fine as is Rossum who has nothing to do.  The reason we watch this movie, however, is the destruction.  It looks good (well, as good as the destruction of our planet can look).  The trouble is just that all of the climate stuff is done in the first half of the movie, so that the rest of it is just anti-climactic.

A movie like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" makes me wonder what happens after the movie ends.  What happens to all these people now that the climate has stabilized?  Is there is a shift in ecological responsibility?  Will there be new world powers since half of America (and Europe) is under ice?  Of course, the movie doesn't answer the questions, but it is something to think about after the movie is over.  The reason I think about the questions is also because the movie itself wasn't that good.  It isn't supposed to be, or, at least I don't think it is supposed to be good.  It is a special effects bonanza in the tradition of disaster movies.  In that sense, it is no worse than anything that has come before and it looks better (though ""Deep Impact"" is still far superior to any recent disaster movie).  If you like disaster movies (despite their lack of narrative or performance quality), then this should be entertaining.  If you want an Oscar Caliber film, then look elsewhere.  Grade: C-.

1556092,3,B00005JMXX,"What can one expect from the liberal, scientifically illiterate Hollywood community?  Well, as usual, Hollywood sees it fit to lecture us on our global economic and political system.  Having failed to get their policies enacted politically, Hollywood feels content to say, well, you guys are wrong, and this is what will happen to you.  The Kyoto Protocol--the topic to which this movie touches--is a treaty that President Clinton approved, but knew would never pass, where it received a vote of 99-0.  That means not even a liberal senator such as Kerry or Boxer voted in favor of a jobs-killing bill.

Hollywood is always far more liberal than even the most liberal senator.  This movie is not based on real life at all.  One should sit down and take this as a sci-fi movie - not based on reality, but simply entertainment.

The premise of the film is that the environment is in the hands of one man -- the vice president, who looks similar to Vice President Dick Cheney.  The VP does not believe that we should sacrifice our economy for the environment.  As a result, the movie pedantically notes, the world suffers an economic collapse.  Things get so bad that Americans move to Mexico, and Mexico closes the border on us.  Well!  At least we now know what Mexico would do in an emergency.  Why don't we seal the border the way Mexico did in the movie?

In any case, few reputable scientists would say that we face a crisis.  This movie would say otherwise, but it would be wrong.  But note the special effects -- it's highly amusing.  Excellent CGI.",1105228800,2,1554,4.650735294117647

1556173,4,B00005JMXX,"It's kind of awkward writing a review defending ""The Day After Tomorrow"", because it's not a good movie in any traditional sense of the word.  The script is atrocious, the science is questionable, and some scenes are almost cringe-worthy.  However, I was strangely delighted with this film.  It is arguably the best one Roland Emmerich's ever done, and it's certainly better than his previous two disasters, ""Godzilla"" and ""The Patriot"".

I may be biased towards the movie, since I enjoyed its message about the consequences of our abusing the environment.  However, I found that the scenes of L.A. being devastated by tornadoes and of New York being frozen under a massive glacier to be very impressive.  ""The Day After Tomorrow"" at least tries to be thoughtful, and doesn't shy away from showing people freezing to death and the world changing before Americans' very eyes.

Of course, let's not get too serious here.  The film is a definite bore whenever people start speaking.  It's amusing to watch the talented cast try to make do with a script this bad.  At least two subplots- one involving a teenage romance, and the other a pack of escaped wolves- should have been cut completely.  In terms of actual directorial talent, Emmerich is a cut above Michael Bay (whom I use as the symbol for all worthless directors), but only a small one.

However, both Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhal prove to be engaging characters.  Emmerich wisely does not have ""man triumph over the enemy"", a la ""Independence Day"" and ""The Patriot"".  In this case, the enemy is nature itself, and it's a given from the beginning that the best we can do is to try to survive the climate change, not stop it (it's too late for that).  This makes the film somewhat more believable.  Emmerich also does not force-feed us a human villain.  The conservative vice president (who not coincidentally looks like Dick Cheney) arguably fills this role the first half of the film, but he has a change of heart later on (I doubt the real Dick Cheney ever would).

Because of its spectacular special effects, acceptable characters, and entertaining message, I give ""The Day After Tomorrow"" a recommendation, despite its bad script and corny subplots.  You could do much worse for a night of enertainment, like rent a Michael Bay film.",1104969600,,2297,4.843589743589743
1556174,1,B00005JMXX,"Wow.  I just don't know where to start with this one.  One of the worst movies of all time?  Perhaps.  You know that feeling when you know the movie your watching is so bad you should just cut your losses and stop in the middle, but instead make the unfortunate mistake of continuing till the end?  Well, if not, this movie is for you.  I have not been so dissappointed since Godsend, which I also felt cheated after watching.  Please, I beg of you, spare yourself and turn back now!  The plot is beyond pitiful, the special-effects (which are the main reason I gave this movie a go) are so in-your-face fake that they are rendered silly, and the acting is simply atrocious.  (...) if I didn't suspect he already has been.  The biggest problem here is the lack of human touch.  By that I mean the characters in the movie seem more like robots than humans.  In the wake of the biggest tradgedy in human history, we seem to see no hints of anyone coping with trauma, panic, or grief.  Instead, everyone appear to be calm and collected, going about business as usual as the world as they know it comes crashing down around them.  It really is quite insulting to anyone who has experienced a tradgedy in their lives.  I'm not sure if its the horrible writing or acting at fault here, but I suspect its a combination of the two.  Not only that, but we never ever see any one of what would have been millions upon millions of dead bodies.  Apparently, its entertaining to fake kill millions of innocent people as long as we never actually see any of the corpses.  Sickening.  Im so fed up of big-budget hollywood movie makers taking important scientific theories and completly butchering them into nothing more than another vehicle for the painfully over-used ""tradgedy cause father to reunite with son"" story.  This trite trivilization of such a horrible disaster is really sickening, especially in the wake of the recent catastrophies in lower asia.

1556175,3,B00005JMXX,"""The Day After Tomorrow,"" the surprisingly successful disaster flick from director Roland Emmerich, serves as pretty much mindless entertainment. I mean, there are so many points in this movie where you have to wonder if they lost pages in the script, or if the writers have actually experienced the mildest winter at all. But then again, I think it's safe to say that any movie that comes out between May and August is meant strictly for entertainment. And in that way, this movie works. It's a story about global warming. You see, the pollution our Earth is subjected to is creating a greenhouse effect, melting the polar ice caps, which in turns floods the closest land -- of which New York seems to be the primary victim, with Canada being wiped out completely (?) -- where the water level reaches unimaginable heights, and, (in)conveiniently freezes, creating a new ice age. The movie centers around a father and son who are in totally different places at the time of disaster. The son (I forget names in this movie), played by ""Spider-man"" understudy Jake Gyllenhaal, is trapped in a New York City library with some of his friends and a crowd of lucky people who are waiting out the storm. His father, played by Dennis Quaid, the scientist who saw it all coming, and thus, is filling in for Jeff Goldblum, heads to New York with two of his headstrong buddies to save his son. There are a few little subplots thrown in between, but they are so half-hearted and under-developed that they have no meaning. They could have easily trimmed 30 minutes off of this movie and received the same effect. The characters are downright dumb, with a hobo and his dog being the intellectual standouts. But then again, we didn't come here to see good acting, did we? Nope. The special effects and the action sequences are where the money's at, and this movie makes good on it's promise. All of the special effects are accomplished well, even if they play out better on the big screen. This is definitely a good movie to show off your new system with. Even if there are some parts that are impossible to believe, such as when Quaid and Co. are travelling through the storm, they obviously can't see the road or where they're going, or anything for that matter, but don't crash (for a while anyways). In real life, they would have made it about 500 yards before landing in a ditch or getting stuck in the snow, or worse, taking a wrong turn into the woods. But anyways, it's still a fun movie, with some shades of political satire -- The President is dumb and useless (and dies very easily), while the Vice President is still dumb, but obviously the man in charge. One of the few minor plots that actually works. Overall, it's an entertaining little romp, if you just detach your brain. If you liked ""Independence Day,"" or God forbid, ""Godzilla"" (I actually did), this one will be right up your alley. Just don't take it too seriously.",1104969600,,2922,4.631984585741812
1556176,4,B00005JMXX,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if the weather just suddenly went out of control? The Day After Tomorrow is a depiction of what might happen if the weather were to spin out of control. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a famous climatologist, suggests a sudden climate change due to the effects of global warming. His many warnings to the President are constantly put aside, but they soon realize the mistake they made.

 If you've watched other films with Dennis Quaid, you'd expect his role to be quite similar in this movie, which would be the hero of the action packed film. Quaid stars as the main character in this film and most of the film is focused on him and his family. He stars as a climatologist, but the movie rarely ever focuses on it. Instead it's more about how Jack Hall is willing to risk his life to get his son out of the frozen city of New York. This shows a role more like that of a father rather than that of a climatologist.

 Roland Emmerich directs The Day After Tomorrow in a way similar to other movies he directed before such as Godzilla (1998) and Independence Day (1996). He concentrates on big global issues, like the testing of nuclear bombs, first contact with aliens and in this movie, the issue of global warming. Just like the previous movies he directs, The Day After Tomorrow has impressive eye-catching special effects which can grab your attention when you least expect it. The movie provides realistic special effects that immerse the audience in a believable setting. Probably the only disappointing part of the CGI animations would be the vicious wolves, which are so ruthless, it makes that particular scene rather far-fetched. Besides that, the movie's special effects are undoubtedly the most impressive aspect of the film.

 The film, however, speaks against the U.S. government quite a lot. The United States President (Perry King) can't seem to make a single decision about what to do with all the warnings he is receiving. Instead, he asks the vice president (Kenneth Welsh), who looks strikingly similar to Dick Cheney, to deal with it. He responds by continuously telling the president to ignore it all. This is, of course, a serious mistake and they soon learn the consequences of their actions. This might cause people to view the U.S. government as something like the bad guys of the film. It also makes one wonder what Emmerich's intentions were with the cast he chose. At present day, George Bush is responding quite similarly to the President in this film by saying that the issue of global warming is not a big deal at all and there are greater matters to be worrying about. Since the president of the movie acts in a suspiciously similar way, it may seem that Emmerich purposely chose specific actors to portray the U.S. government in a rather negative way.

 Through this film, Emmerich shows the destructive power of global warming, also to tell us not to be ignorant about global warming and to show that it is a real threat. In the movie, no one bothered to do anything until they finally saw what the consequences were. Everyone is affected by the storm and no one is spared. There are so many hidden messages, that it seems incredibly obvious that the movie's purpose is to raise awareness among the people. One such quote was said by Jack ""Mr. President, if we don't act now it's going to be too late."" This quote like many others throughout the movie show that global warming can become a very big problem in the future.

 One thing lacking in The Day After Tomorrow is a complex plot. There is not much development in the story, so when the film ends, you might walk away feeling a bit unsatisfied. There are moments of suspense, that can keep you on your toes, but overall the plot is nothing to be impressed with. Emmerich's other movies have plots that develop much more effectively than The Day After Tomorrow, which means someone might end up seeing this movie for the special effects, rather than the story.

 The Day After Tomorrow focuses very well on the current issue of global warming, making it a very good movie to watch. Along with the incredible special effects, the movie is entertaining, yet believable. With these strong points, the movie can make anyone wonder whether or not it is too late to stop global warming from becoming a reality.",1104883200,,4329,4.696569920844327
1556177,2,B00005JMXX,"I watched this movie last night of pay-per-view (had a free movie coupon). The action scenes and special effects were great. The acting was fair. The plot and tone were awful.

Make no bones about it, this is an anti-industrial, anti-capitalist propaganda movie, which manages to take hateful cheap shots at President Bush (dim, indecisive) and Vice President Cheney (uncarring money-grubbing capitalist) along the way.

The evil industrialized world (mainly American) has pumped too much greenhouse gas into the atmoshpere, which heats up the planet, which melts the polar ice caps, which dilutes the salt content of the oceans, which screws up ocean currents, which causes the ocean tempurature to drop suddenly, which causes world-wide super-storms, which bring on the next ice age in about two weeks.

Some reviewers have suggested ignoring the fear-mongering junk science of this movie and just enjoy the ride. That's fine if you can do it. The problem is that this is ""message"" movie.

1556249,3,B00005JMXX,"The ultimate disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow depicts a change in climate that sweeps the globe and triggers a modern ice age. An original premise long overdue for cinematic treatment, it offers astonishing and eerie imagery: multiple tornadoes whipping across Los Angeles, an arctic depression over Scotland freezing all beings in an instant, a tidal surge engulfing Manhattan, and flocks of birds flying south for the summer.
Director Roland Emmerich (who thrilled audiences with 1996's Independence Day) clearly delights in scenes of mass destruction. Artfully crafted, these successive calamities come one after another with but a handful of humorous moments to break the tension.
At the centre of the story is Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist studying the effects of global warming. His chilling theories are ignored by government officials - a plot point that is all too common in such films - even as the world is ravaged by extreme weather conditions. And after the northern hemisphere is encircled by frigid storms, Hall must journey from Washington to New York to rescue his teenaged son, Sam.
Though such an Armageddon would take a couple of centuries to evolve (barring a shift of the earth's magnetic axis), the film compresses developments into just a few days. Thankfully, the scientific interpretations are presented clearly and logically without getting buried in technical jargon.
Like Independence Day, Emmerich (who co-wrote the screenplay with Jeffrey Nachmanoff) plunges headfirst into the storyline, and populates the film with an enormous number of characters. But they all react rather placidly to the shocking events, with little hysteria or emotion - their hearts seem as cold and unfeeling as the eventual all-consuming blizzard. With the shocking proceedings presented as more fun than grim, any sense of tragedy seems to have been sucked into an atmospheric vortex.
The first half of the film also seems disjointed, as if numerous consequential scenes were deleted in favour of a pointless subplot about a pediatric cancer patient. It is only once the glacial onslaught has begun that the story becomes dramatic and energized, with plenty of surprises and innovative scenes of suspense.
Dennis Quaid is believable and competent as the dedicated Hall, while Jake Gyllenhaal is charming as the determined Sam. Relative newcomer Emmy Rossum, as Sam's love interest, lights up the screen; this neophyte is a star in the making. (Watch for her later this year as Christine in the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera.)
The Day After Tomorrow is a fascinating and refreshing film that does without the standard elements of most big-budget Hollywood productions. While it lacks the intensity and excitement of Independence Day, it is a tribute to man's will to survive, demonstrating how remarkably adaptive our species can be.

Well I took the chance and I liked the special affects and there was some good parts in the movie.  The one thing I was disappointed in was that the ending just ends, they really should have though about putting this movie on two disc and making more out of the ending.  It just ends with them getting pick up by the helocopters and off in the sunset.  I'm not saying it was a terrible ending, I'm just saying they should have shown more of the aftermath and all.

And now before you can turn around a big disaster strikes India.  A earthquake that hits just off the coast of northwestern Indonesia on Sunday Dec 26, 2004 That causes a Tsunami(A Huge Tital Wave)to strike India and neighboring countries in south Asia that kills a whopping so far 63,000 people.  I know this has nothing to do with this movie really but it does have to do alot with mothernature and mothernature is apart of a key factor in this movie.

1556251,2,B00005JMXX,"I just saw ""Day after Tomorrow"" tonight. It started interesting at first, with volleyball-sized hail in Tokyo and an F5 tornado outbreak in LA. I believe this was inspired by a television special on what would happen if an F5 tornado were to strike Dallas, except that this movie took 8 or so tornadoes to do what just one tornado did in the special. Then the ice and huge storms came, and I recogized the story immediately. It is a movie version of ""The Coming Global Superstorm"", which I reviewed in 2000. At that time I wondered what the science was behind the book. The movie takes the controversial science and adds plenty of Hollywood hype, with bits of ""Titanic"", ""Deep Impact"", and ""Independence Day"" thrown in. I still don't know if it could happen, although I think not. But the main fault I find with the movie is that it addresses the wrong crisis. Global climate change is a problem that our society needs to address, but the big problem is peak oil. If we are going to have less oil, gas, and coal in coming years, then climate change ought to ease a bit instead. The oil problem could affect all of us, so I felt that we needed a movie which addresses that instead and perhaps be based on something like Kenneth Deffeyes' ""Hubbert's Peak"".",1104105600,,1254,4.504385964912281

While watching this film, I was impressed with the images of Manhattan being flooded and everyone rushing to the public library.  I thought the concept for the movie was cool, but Dennis Quaid was very unbelievable.

Dialogically, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen.  The script was plain awful.  The lines were very plain and bland.

Even worse than that, these wolves that were added to the film did not fit and were completely unneccessary.

I am only giving this a 2 instead of a 1 because I thought the imagery was very enjoyable.

Aside from many technical blunders, the movie, as entertainment, was good. There is a scene showing a massive tidal wave hitting Liberty Island and New York. OK, I guess it could happen, maybe. But the Statue of Liberty certainly not be left standing. Neither would any of the buildings. All that aside, the movie does have entertainment value. As for the plot , and story line, the jury is still out. The premis that man has anything to do with climactic change, short of atomic disaster, is both arrogant and foolhardy. The possibilty of another ice age, it could happen. It has happened in the past, many times, AND WITH-OUT MAN'S INVOLVMENT.

My recommendation is that you rent it first. I personally wouldn't pay $19 for it. I might pay $7 for it.

1556347,3,B00005JMXX,"The Day After Tomorrow is an exciting movie with a throwaway plot, but it has some of the best special effects in recent movie history.  At an United Nations Conference, climatologist Jack Hall states that in as few as a hundred or as many as a thousand years, global warming will be begin to change the Earth's climate in drastic ways.  No one pays much heed to his warning.  Only weeks later, the severe climate changes come much sooner than Hall expected, plunging the world into another Ice Age.  When Hall discovers his son is trapped in New York, he decides to march from Washington DC to NY to rescue him along with two close friends.  If you couldn't tell, the plot is more than a little predictable, but that is beside the point.  What makes this movie worthwhile are the extraordinary special effects, whether it be countless tornadoes ravaging dowtown Los Angeles or a huge tsunami-like wave flooding the streets of New York City.  Equally impressive are the shots from the space shuttle orbitting Earth of the changing face of the planet as the ice moves farther and farther south.  Don't buy this movie for the story, get it for the amazing special effects.

  Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall, a scientist who must travel to New York to save his son.  Even though the science in the movie is pretty far-fetched, Quaid makes it believable when he tries to explain what is happening all over the world.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jack's son, Sam, who must try to survive in the Public Library with a small group of survivors.  Ian Holm stars as Terry Rapson, a scientist working in Scotland who believes and supports what Hall is trying to explain to the world.  Sela Ward plays Jack's wife Lucy, a doctor trying to save a young cancer patient.  The movie also stars Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Austin Nichols, Arjay Smith, and Tamyln Tomita.

Let's face it: the effects of global warming are indeed all around us, with acid rain and the spread of once tropic-exclusive diseases, but I think that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" does exemplify the effects of our pollution, but for a point. Toward the end of the film, I thought that it was a bit preachy about what we should be doing with the world's resources, but you have to admit that the film was rather entertaining.

First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely divine in just about everything, from ""Donnie Darko"" to ""The Good Girl,"" so it's no surprise that he did a great acting job in ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" either.

There are emotional aspects to the film, also, with children being left behind in a cancer ward of a hospital, to people freezing alive in the eye of the storm, to a father fighting to save his son.

Like I already mentioned, I don't think that the plot is currently feasible, but instead serves as a warning to what may come in many, many, many years.

I enjoyed the film and would watch it again. I recommend it to fans of Gyllenhaal and advocates for the environment. Keep an open mind and remember that another ice age probably won't happen for many years to come (despite the fact that the film scared my 16-year-old sister silly).

Even worse than the world ending the day after tomorrow is paleoclimatologist Dennis Quaid's son, Jake Gyllenhaal, is in NYC for a school activity and he hasn't had a chance to knock boots with supersexy Emmy Rossum yet. Ohhh, the humanity! Is there no God?!!! Multiple hailstorms, tornadoes, tidal waves, supercooled superstorms and wolf attacks later Jake is trapped in NYC and it's up to paleoclimatologist Dennis Quaid to come save him.

1556353,1,B00005JMXX,"The Day After Tomorrow (Roland Emmerich, 2004)

Long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there came to be something known as the ""disease-of-the-week"" movie. While the term wasn't popularized until the CBS TV-movies of the seventies, the original disease-of-the-week movie was Billy Wilder's 1945 Oscar winner The Lost Weekend, which portrays four days in the life of alcoholic Ray Milland. The Lost Weekend was also the first in a species of truly terrifying disease-of-the-week movies-- those who influence public perception, and ultimately public policy, on a particular topic so much that they become more of a keystone in the formation of that policy than any scientific papers.

The Day After Tomorrow is the first of that kind of movie we've seen in a long while, and it may be the most terrifying of the lot. Roland Emmerich directed his own screenplay, and his authority to comment on environmentally conscious topics is obvious from his earlier treatment of the subject (the 1998 remake of Godzilla). The movie's plot takes the already exaggerated-out-of-control beliefs we have about global warming and takes them to the most absurd conclusions possible (though to his credit, Emmerich does manage to trick us into thinking those conclusions are not quite as absurd as they are). It would all be quite amusing if we didn't have the model of The Lost Weekend in the background, telling us people will accept this as gospel in a few years. The movie deserves zero stars as a starting point for being morally offensive on both surface and subtextual levels.

Aside from the utter idiocy of the premise, which shouldn't really surprise us (after all, Hollywood has been exaggerating inanities for decades), the movie takes a stellar cast and puts them into seventies disaster-movie mode (a subgenre of the disease-of-the-week movie that eventually grew to eclipse its parent genre; you still see The Poseidon Adventure on TV, but when was the last time you saw The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened?). Every possible scene where Emmerich could have inserted someone managing to get out of a scrape just in time, he did. Everywhere a character could stop and expound on how awful global warming is, he does. The whole thing is utterly predictable if you've seen any two disaster movies from the seventies during your lifetime.

That said, the cast makes the best of what they get. Jake Gyllenhaal, who could previously do no wrong (he almost singlehandedly took the dumbest script on the planet, Bubble Boy, and turned it into a work of comic genius), even gets swallowed up in the general stupidity. Given that, you know that the other above-average-but-not-great stars here are probably going to fail. Dennis Quaid gets a chance to overact, and takes it as often as possible. Sela Ward, playing Quaid's wife, is in the script as a ""rule tool"": Quaid cannot have a son (Gyllenhaal) unless he's married, and cannot survive unless he has someone to come home to. Emmy Rossum, as Gyllenhaal's love interest, and Tamlyn Tomita, as Quaid's partner's love interest, serve the same function. Both are a joy to watch on the screen, and all too easy on the eyes, but aren't given anything near enough screen time to bring anything to their parts.

The most astonishing piece of casting wizardry to be found in this film is the presence of Ian Holm, as a colleague of Quaid's trapped in a Scotland weather station with two of his co-workers. Holm's character exists solely to feed Quaid's team information from farther north, so they can predict the course of the storm that freezes the northern hemisphere. This is obvious from the moment the word ""Scotland"" appears on the screen in a subtitle. Holm's character is entirely two-dimensional. In a horror film, he'd be a brainless, buxom blonde walking around with ""kill me"" tattooed on her forehead. What on earth possessed Holm to take this role? Gyllenhaal being in this film is excusable; he's still a rising star, and having his name on a blockbuster, however bad, is certain to entrench him further down in the minds of casting directors. Holm, however, has previously had impeccable taste in his choice of films. Even those films that may have otherwise looked dismal in concept he accepted turned out to be some of the best in their genre; one need look no farther than Alien as testament to this. More recently, Existenz, Joe Gould's Secret, and From Hell are all excellent examples of the same. So how could the man have looked at this script and had the thought (and this is the only reason I can discern for him accepting a role in this mess) that Roland Emmerich could make a film as well as Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, Stanley Tucci, or the Hughes brothers?

The only thing about The Day After Tomorrow that makes it worth watching in any way, shape, or form is the watchability of the thing itself. Like every disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow cranks up the pace from the get-go and never lets up. The pace is constantly fast, and as a movie that goes a smidgen over two hours, it still runs faster than some movies of just over half its length I've seen recently. Were it not such a morally deficient movie, The Day After Tomorrow would define the mindless disaster flick, and could have actually been the start of a renaissance of the seventies disaster movie, which many film fans (and critics) rank near the top of their guilty-pleasures lists. As it stands, however, this monstrosity only goes to show, like Emmerich's preceding films The Patriot and Godzilla, that when Roland Emmerich directs a good movie (or even a mediocre movie, like Independence Day), it's the exception to the rule. The Day After Tomorrow is, quite simply, awful on every level. Half a star because Gyllenhaal and Rossum actually manage to make a paper-thin romantic subplot look like it might actually have some substance.",1102982400,3,5878,4.873
1556354,2,B00005JMXX,"The enviro-fantasy ""The Day After Tomorrow"" has a single redeemable trait...the special effects are very good. These special effects are not on par with ""Star Wars"" great, just good. Roland Emmerich's (director and co writer) plot for his movie ""Independence Day"" is more plausible than having the earth's next ice age occur in less than a week (dah). As a side bar: the mastodon that died ""with grass in his mouth"" was killed by falling through ice on the Arctic tundra.

Dennis Quaid plays his stereotypical role...regular guy who is largely ignored or discounted most of his life then steps up to face extreme adversity only to triumph. Dennis Quaid plays the same role in ""The Alamo"" and ""The Rookie."" It is a role that he is good at and he does a commendable job even in this largely forgettable movie.

The beginning of the movie provides and immediate suspense, three men researching something in a very very cold place: Antarctica.  The ice begins to crack - and action ensues.

Then the only real issue with this movie becomes apparant.  And while it's only one real issue, it's a whopper.  Time is *never* given.  The day, is *never* given.  The best we can work with are the rare cues of ""a few days ago"" or ""yesterday"" or ""it'll take x hours""... in which case, was that really a few days ago?  I mean.. perhaps the speaker forgot? (trust me, when you hear this line, you will understand).

Aside from time passing at a pace that is never provided, this is a good movie.  The story itself is perhaps a bit... well, overdone - but the ending makes up for it.  I will not spoil it, but at the very least it's not the same cliche ending.

Also, the special effects were pretty spectacular at times.  Even the ravenous wolves looked real now and again.

I haven't read the book, but I believe it will likely be far better.  The movie seemed like it had so much to say, and didn't have a lot of time to say it.  Things like, as I mentioned, time itself.  Also the fleshing out of characters (like the homeless guy) wasn't all done very well in the movie.

If you really want to be entertained with this particular story of doom, I would advise you to read the book - it likely fills in what the movie felt as if it lacked.  Oddly, half of this movie is set in a library...

There are truths to some explanations on how weather phenomena occur, such as temperate climate being dependant on the ocean currents. (and yes, there have been rare cases of hurricanes forming over land.) But for the most part, leave the hard science at home when watching this movie and it will be a more pleasurable experience.

The visual effects are spectacular. Even though the ideas of multiple twisters in LA or a tidal wave hitting NYC are ludicrous the movie did a decent job in making it more convincing. Nothing happens this quick in real life, but I don't think watching the air slowly chill for decades will have the same effect. The story seems like an afterthought; not great but not too horrible either. Some subplots and dialogue, like the one dealing with the kid with cancer, are unnecessary. Unfortunately by the halfway point Emmerich runs out of disaster ideas and focuses more on the plot and from here the movie drags on. I actually wouldn't have minded if the disaster scenes were drawn out more in other parts of the world. But at this point, the climatologist going on a long trek to find his son, against all odds, was a bit out there. Still, the action more than makes up for this. The ending wasn't predictable but it doesn't leave you with a bad taste like other sappy endings. It could've been worse, like NASA suddenly inventing some wonder-machine to reverse the weather.

The movie has a message on how we should be careful with our resources but at the same time the over-the-top weather disasters may confuse the more ignorant people. But what really happens after global warming begins (besides the obvious)? Most of the scenarios predicted are pure speculation and we're only basing it against past models of climate change. The events in this movie are best taken as a 'what if' mash-up of all these theories.",1101686400,,2106,4.7046070460704605
1556551,3,B00005JMXX,"- but I ran into problems trying to care about any of the characters.

One very good point is that ""global warming"" doesn't necessarily mean that everything gets warmer everywhere. It does mean that the world's weather is a mchine driven by heat, and that warming is like nitro in the gas tank. Hots get hotter, colds get colder, everything becomes more of whatever it was, and not necessarily where you'd expect. Another good point is that indirect effects, like shifts in ocean currents, may exert surprisingly strong control over the climate.

For dramatic purposes, all those effects were compressed from decades to days or even minutes. Rising ocean levels were crammed into a single wave that flooded New York to waist depth on the Statue of Liberty. Nice effects, but I just don't think many buildings would be left standing if hit by a wall of water ten storeys high. Maybe, opposite of the intuitive result, global warming could trigger a new ice age. That would certainly be dramatic, but I suspect that it would take more than the hour or two shown here.

Set your expectations properly: it's just a disaster movie, about as plausible as those asteroid movies a couple of years ago. If you've already dedicated yourself to a useless evening, you may as well watch this.

This movie is nothing but CGI overkill with no plot at around it except for a guy looking for his son. thats about all, oh and expect that romance crap around it that happens in every other movie.

This is another excuse to use SFX and CGI in a movie without bothering to concintrate on a story line around it, the CGI might look good, but you do not have a good movie based on that alone, when are these people going to learn that CGI do not carry a movie?",1101513600,5,610,4.033057851239669
1556553,4,B00005JMXX,"Like its predecessors ""Independence Day"" and ""Stargate,"" Roland Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow features state-of-the-art special effects, detailing the devastation, both human and architectural, from the onslaught of major climactic changes.  However, the sfx take a back seat to the human drama unfolding among the characters.

Sure, it's hokey and commonplace, at times, but sometimes such structured and familiar situations are a necessity for movie audiences.  Who can't help but cheer climatologist/father Dennis Quaid as he seeks to rescue his son, trapped in the library during a major ice ""hurricane""?  Who can't be moved by the courage of Sela Ward as she remains behind with a bedridden cancer-stricken child as everyone else in her hospital abandons them for the safety of southern locales?  Who can't be amused by Glenn Plummer, cast as a homeless citizen, that spouts some of the film's funniest and poignant lines?  Who cannot be sympathetic for Ian Holm and company as they sit in their weather monitoring station, awaiting impending doom and thinking of the loved ones that they will leave behind?

Even Jake Gyllenhaal's ""Sam"" is heroic as he attempts to save himself and the rest of the library's inhabitants from the dropping temperatures and a pack of marauding wolves that had escaped from a city animal compound.

When the movie was first released, I opted not to see it, thinking that the imagined destruction of New York following the real-life collapse of The Twin Towers was a little unsympathetic to those that experienced the tragedy.  However, after allowing the passage of time, I can now view the film a bit more open-mindedly for what the producers/director intended: mostly entertainment with a bit of science thrown in, coupled with the best of humanity as it seeks to survive overwhelming odds.

1) There is no way multiple ""superstorms"" and a polar ice-cap meltdown could happen in a matter of days.

2) The statue of liberty would not survive a massive tidal wave.

3) You wouldn't find arctic wolves in Manhattan three days after the ""Ice Age"" set in.

4) The New York City Public Library woud likely not protect you from an immediate drop in temperature of 200 degrees or so.

5) It would probably take many, MANY months of book burning (to keep warm) at the New York City Public Library before you would have to even consider burning the Gutenberg Bible.

6) With current Global Positioning Systems, it would be highly unlikely that an oil tanker would cruise up 5TH Avenue even if all ground-based communications were lost.

I can't wait to throw this DVD in the trash and watch something more believable...like ""Independence Day,"" or one of the ""Ernest"" movies.

1556633,2,B00005JMXX,"Roland Emmerich made ""Independence Day,"" a movie I really liked a lot .... so much so that I saw it THREE times in the theaters. Well, now Emmerich has taken the very same plot formula and replaced the giant alien spacecraft with giant weather catastrophes! It's all here: The harried scientist trying to warn the White House of impending doom, family members trying reunite with their loved ones, cars and trucks and buses tossed around like toys, spectacular scenes of citywide devastation, etc.

But any crowd-pleasing charm there was in ""Independence Day"" seems completely lacking in ""Day After Tomorrow."" Movies about aliens bent on conquering the Earth I can enjoy, since we have nothing in reality that such a scenario can measure up to. Global Warming, on the other hand, is a very real issue, something we all ought to be taking a lot more seriously for the sake of future generations ... but in this film Global Warming gets reduced to cartoonishness. Some of the science is worthy: The delicate balance of salinity in the oceans, for instance, can have a greater effect on ocean currents and weather systems than most of us would think. But Global Warming is such a long process, it wouldn't have made an exciting film, so Emmerich & Co. speed things up. A LOT. Meteorologists everywhere must have been CRINGING when they watched this flick.

I'm giving this film a VERY generous two stars, mainly for special effects. I have to admit that the storm surge flooding of New York City was pretty well-done, and the spectacle of Los Angeles being flattened by tornados made me stand up and cheer! But I don't think the producers of this movie have ever seen a real hail storm; hailstones tend to be white and rounded and hit the ground at a pretty impressive velocity, whereas in ""Day After Tomorrow"" the hailstones are clear and jagged and appear to be dropped from the top of a ladder!

Anyway, whatever eye-candy there is in this movie simply cannot make up for the laughably clichd dialogue. It's really bad. I found myself talking back to the characters on screen the same way the bots do in ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" Sorry, I can't really recommend this one.",1101168000,,2177,4.753968253968254

I'm not so sure if it was just a horrendous storyline, or the actors failed to bring any spark to the screen. In any event, the only thing working for this movie was the terrific special effects.

The premise is great - sudden climatological change causes a new ice age in a matter of days over the entire northern hemisphere.  Great special effects of the storms (especially the destruction of LA), but then, poof, it's over. The last 40 minutes is about a silly attempt by Dennis Quaid to find his son trapped in a frozen NYC.  No suspense, bad acting, bad dialogue, totally unbelievable, boring and predictable.

What a movie this could have been.  Will mankind survive the new ice age?  How will civilization reorganize? How will the different main characters that could have been set up (but weren't) manage?  How does it all tie together?  None of this was realized, nor most likely, was even considered by the writers, producers and directors, as it was in, say, Independence Day which was pretty good.

Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is the worst of them all, it will take some months (or years) to producers around the world give him another chance in something so ""big-budgeted"".",1100908800,,604,5.101010101010101

Ok, it starts out with a team of explorers in the Arctic when a giant crack opens in the ice. Is the explorer dead? No! At the last minute, with what? 50 pounds of equipment on his back, he performs a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-style jump across 10 feet of empty air and saves himself. Then the scene goes to a labratory and it shows that the earth will be frozen in a few days in a totally. So, because of global warming, giant expensive-special-effects waves come into New York and people run into a library which, for whatver reason, is filled with food and blankets. Then, voila, everything's frozen! So, the terrible actor's character's father says he'll rescue him from the library. We all know how boring the library is! He succeeds thanks to the main character using a pay phone underwater! So, in conclusion, this is a really stupid movie. A reviewer said this is good because its realistic, unlike Independence Day. I'd have to say  this is as unrealistic as Independence Day. No person,e ven a little kid, would see this movie and think, could the world freeze with giant tornadoes and hurricanes any day? Also, this movie is boring. We all saw previews and craved it until it came out. But, lots of the movie is set in that stupid library. (What's with the wolves!

Where this movie really shines is it's superb DTS 5.1 audio track.  If you're watching the movie without it you will be severely distanced from it and probably bored to death.  If you're watching in 5.1 you'll be looking outside to see if the world is still there when it's over.

If you have a DTS capable system I would recommend you at least rent this film just to hear it as it probably has the best audio of any film ever.

  Lines like, ""There are more things to do with books than burning them"" are just annoying and uncalled for and would make any lover of literature cringe, even under the circumstances that the books were being burned.

1556768,4,B00005JMXX,"This is a movie that wants to give the world a message, and though I am sad to say it fails to do this it is actually worth watching for a variety of reasons.

So where do I begin?  Well for starters I'm a major fan of Ian HOLM and Adrian LESTER who played the British scientists in the film, not that they had big parts but in my opinion they were by far the best actors in the whole movie,.

Dennis QUAID did a fair to reasonable job as the beleaguered Climatologist Jack Hall and Jake GYLLLENHAAL did well as his estranged son Sam who is trapped in New York when a tidal wave hits the city before the start of the ""big freeze"".

We are given a taste of the weather to come, with falling ice the size of basket balls in Japan, and snow in New Delhi and it just gets worse which is what the film is all about.

The film jumps from situation to situation, the trapped and doomed British Scientists in Scotland, Jack HALL trying to get to New York to his son Sam, Jack's Doctor wife looking after a dying child in a hospital and fragments of people's lives as they try to walk to safety across the frozen wasteland that is now the Big Apple.

You can't fault the special effects, they are superb though the wolves in the zoo are a bet puppetry looking in my opinion but they give Sam and his friends a good run for their money when they go looking for antibiotics on a ship that has just floated up a New York Street, courtesy of the tidal wave.

The plot isn't overly complex, we have the usual dumb people leaving the library when they are warned not to, ho hum, but hey we have to have few fatalities don't we along with the heroic I'll give my life up for my friends person, but like I said this is why we the General Public to the movies!

As a pointer Glenn PLUMMER as the down and out Luther gives a solid performance, especially with his lovable dog in tow, he is by far the smartest person trapped in the library by the way; he knows what it is like to be cold and hungry in New York and his advise though on the surface is laughable, it is also very sound.

There are some poignant scenes, such a librarian holding onto an old bible, to keep warm the library have to be burned, but he is hoping that this one book can be saved, so that civilisation can remember something about itself, that actually brought a lump to my throat which quite surprised me!

All the same this film is an a real pot boiler of a movie with all the good ingredients to make you want to sit down and watch it, you have a love story thrown in, a family reunion, the tragic death of the President, the redemption of the Vice-President who hadn't believed the big freeze was going to happen, state of the art special effects and a pretty good sound track too, plus everything else that is going on!

I might add that the Director has taken ideas from other movies, there is a scene where a young Japanese man is seen sitting having a drink of saki before going home when the basket ball size hailstones start to fall, he tries to get to safety, he is talking to his wife/girlfriend on the phone when he is felled and all you hear is his wife/girlfriend on the phone screaming his name.  If any of you remember the film Meteor with Sean Connery, there is a scene where a Chinese young man legs it home to try and get his family a way before the tidal wave hits, he is going to leave the family dog behind but he grabs it along with his wife and son and tries to flee but dies in the attempt.  Not the same but the concept is very similar!

I do think there is a message in this film, quite an important one too but sadly it is lost in the Blockbuster mentality that it is liberally tarred with, for films with a message I would suggest you try watching, ""I Heard the Owl Call my Name"" or ""Where the River Runs Black,"" or ""The Emerald Forest,"" now those are films that have far more impact than ""The Day After Tomorrow"" perhaps because they weren't made on a such massive budget and had a reasonable idea as to what audience they were catering too.",1100217600,,4028,4.154043645699615

I had also heard that the movie was very political and was a basic slap in the face to my fellow Republicans.  But it was NOT that bad, concerning a political slant, at all.

I really enjoyed the special effects.  The acting was not bad - I almost always enjoy everything Dennis Quaid does.  The story line could have been a little more believable, but all and all, this is a film that delivers great scenes, good dialogue and some very attractive people on screen.

I can't think of a single part of the film that I found myself getting bored - that's a good thing.  I would suggest this movie to people of all ages.

Emmy Rossum is awesome on the screen.  She manages to have that girl-next-door look and supermodel look going at the same time.

Jake Gyllenhaal (from ""October Sky"" and the shockingly terrible ""Bubble Boy"") does a great job in this film!  I really think he took the role as far as it could go.  I couldn't picture anyone else plaing this role.

The laughable dialogue and silly twists entertain only because they're so bad.

From the junk science to the sophomoric political propaganda (Note: the Kyoto Accords will have no net effect on any global warming trend) this movie is a nonstop laugh riot. I can't think of a movie with such cheesy dialogue even surpassing ""Independence Day"".

Here are a few of the greatest rib-splitting scenes:

Vice President Dick Cheney... er, I mean Becker... is depicted as evil because he won't order a complete disruption of US society based on the assertions of two climatologists.

Later Cheney... er, I mean Becker, orders the National Guard to evacuate the entire southern half of the United States. Yeah, that's a good one.

1556773,4,B00005JMXX,"The key to success in any summer-blockbuster type film is whether or not the script allows for enough suspension of disbelief to allow the special effects to do their job.  ""Godzilla"" is the perfect example of when this fails to happen; in spite of spectacular special effects, the atrocious script made the movie ridiculous and largely unwatchable.  Thankfully, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" has avoided this pitfall.  By working in enough real science, the director/writers allow the viewer to accept an otherwise unbelievable premise, and enjoy a special effects extravaganza with a surprising amount of heart.

That premise is that fresh water pouring of the melting polar ice caps have disrupted  the Gulf Stream, which is responsible for North America's and Northern Europe's mild climates, causing the rapid onset of an Ice Age.  As I alluded to above, this is actually a fairly accepted scientific theory, and while the timeframe is far too compressed to have any foundation in reality (ice ages take hundred or thousands of years to develop) this plausibility is sufficient to make the movie enjoyable.

Which is a good thing as the special effects are spectacular, and include tornados tearing apart Los Angeles, British helicopters falling out of the sky frozen solid, and the coup de grace, New York City being inundated and flash frozen.  That said, all of these bells and whistles would be for naught if it weren't for a good story, and the actors deliver a solid, if not spectacular  tale.

In the best tradition of the post-apocalyptic genre, the story wisely starts out globally, narrows to a national focus, and then continues to spiral down to a few key characters who can place the unimaginable in some sort of digestible context.  In this case, the viewer follows Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who has predicted the consequences of polar melting, as he fights the way through the storm in an effort to rescue his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is trapped in New York with several of his friends.  This personalization of a global calamity is highly effective, as it clearly represents the most basic consequences of the calamity and represents similar efforts that would be going on all over the world.  As a bonus, the film also toys with modern norms, as Americans flood over the border into Mexico, which adds an additional point of reference for this vastly altered world.

The DVD itself is solid if not spectacular.  The sound and image are both superb, and fully convey the experience of cutting edge special effects.  The disc also includes the usual deleted scenes (only two, which while perhaps to be expected with a special effects thriller, was somewhat disappointing) and commentaries.  Again, these are the usual, and really represent what would be the minimum standard for DVD releases; as such, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw a special edition release down the road, so that's something to keep in mind.

All in all, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is an enjoyable movie featuring superb effects, and a surprisingly good story.  It will particularly appeal to fans of the post-apocalyptic genre, as it pays tribute to several core themes of the genre.  However, it is easily appreciated as a thriller, and has a surprising amount of hear as well.

1556854,2,B00005JMXX,"This film is to the United States as Godzilla is to Japan. That the same director who directed the Americanized version of Godzilla directed this film should be of little wonder. Just as Godzilla was a metaphor for Japan's destruction, so is global warming a metaphor for the excesses of the United States. We waste the world's resources like no other country or region on Earth, and the vast majority of us just don't care.

So there's an intelligent metaphor at work. Sadly, there isn't anything unique about the plot. All of the characters are cardboard cutouts; standard stereotypes with no will or minds of their own. There are scenes stolen directly from Titanic. The only redeeming thing about the film is the special effects, which are extraordinary, but special effects do not a movie make. It would be like judging the quality of a children's picture book solely by the quality of the artwork. And that, I fear, is an apt simile for this movie.

If you don't care about the originality or unique content of a story, and special effects are really the only reason you see movies, you may like this. There's a caveat to that, though. Once the special effects of the massive storm end, the film comes to a halt like a sprinter running into a wall. Everything just STOPS.",1099872000,,1277,4.671111111111111
1556855,2,B00005JMXX,"Years ago, I had the pleasure of seeing ""Rent"" on Broadway.  I thought the play was hilarious.  But while watching it I noticed something peculiar: I was laughing when no one else was.  Many times during the course of watching DAT I had a similar experience.  What made it so funny for me were the clich&eacute;s piled so high they practically snowed New York under all by themselves, and the general plot holes, PC speechifying, and all-around sloppy writing.

The clich&eacute;s, oh lord the clich&eacute;s.  U2 actually made a very good song out of a nonstop string of clich&eacute;s (""With or Without You""); I guess the writers of DAT were attempting to do something similar here.  They failed.

 Here are but a few of DAT's kitschy, classic clich&eacute;s.

The lines:

* ""Jack, you've been working for 24 hours straight; the only one who hasn't taken a break.""
* ""If we don't act now, it's going to be too late.""
* ""Let's get you out of those wet clothes.""
* ""I have to do this."" ""I know.""
* ""Sam might not have one more day.""
* ""I made my son a promise. I'm going to keep it.""

The scenes:

* The boy with leukemia. The writers should've had the guts to just go ahead and name him ""Timmy.""
* If you're an ethnic floor polisher, or an ethnic New York City bum, your chances of surviving a disaster are very good indeed. If it's a choice between you and a bunch of white yuppies, you are practically guaranteed to survive.
* The speech-to-the-roomful-of-important-military-and-civilian-personnel scene. The only thing missing was Peter Sellers in a wheelchair with a German accent.

Now, some of these clich&eacute;s might not rise to the level of ""Dammit Jim, I'm just a simple country doctor, not a miracle worker!"" but they all at least come close. I think the only way the movie could have been more clich&eacute;d would be if Michael Bay had directed.

The plot holes, the PC-ness, the lack of common sense:

* How exactly does cold weather cause wolves to get smart enough to bust out of the Manhattan Zoo? Also, since when does the Manhattan Zoo have wolves? Sea lions -- yes. Penguins -- yes. Polar bears -- yes. Wolves -- no.
* Is it just me, or is Sela Ward a dead ringer for Michael Jackson?
* Again, how exactly does global warming cause a new ice age?
* Why did Jack come to rescue his son in the first place (and have one of his teammates die along the way, in yet another great clich&eacute;d scene -- the only thing missing was Quaid yelling ""N-o-o-o-o-o!"" in slow motion as his traveling companion fell to his death)? So he could be there when the rescue helicopters came?
* When he comes to rescue his son, why didn't Jack see the smoke from the burning books rising from the New York Public Library?
* Birds migrating south before the storm. Yeah, yeah, they're smarter than humans, I get it.
* Dick Chen -- er, Vice President Becker, giving a mea culpa, sorry-for-America-destroying-the-world-and-looking-down-on-Latin-America speech at the end of the flick. It sort of reminded me of the end to ""The Jungle.""

I encourage you to buy this movie cheap, or to rent it.  I can't exactly call it camp; the movie cost too much to make to call it that.  F/X saves it from total ignominy.  Anyhow, watch DAT for the laughs, and maybe keep track of the rip-offs from every other disaster movie ever made and all the logic errors and propaganda along the way.",1099872000,4,3375,4.574750830564784
1556856,3,B00005JMXX,"My 12 year old rented this movie and I watched it with him.  I had heard somethings about it when it came out.  As I recall, there was some controversy over how the movie portrayed the Global Warming theory and the official reaction to it by the Executive Branch of the US Government.  As I watched it, I was reminded of another movie my son had brought home; ""The Core"".  Both movies start out with a compelling series of unexplainable phenomenon.  Both then delve into an unbelievable (literally) scientific explanation proposed by an up and coming expert who becomes our hero.  Both then change our focus from the total destruction of the earth and all of its' contents and turn it to the lives of a handful of people.

I found ""The Core"" to actually be more believable than ""The Day After Tommorrow"" even though ""TDAT"" is based on a widely accepted scientific doomsday theory (which, unless I skipped the wrong Evening News broadcast, is not the case with ""The Core"").  I guess the problem with the application of the Global Warming theory in this movie is that it totally discredits the theory.  It does so by suggesting a cataclysmic surge of changes rather than the gradual changes that would occur with a slow but steady rise in the average annual temperature.  It takes the possible and gives us the impossible.  That's OK for the sake of making an exciting disaster movie but it destroys any relevance to possible legitimate issues of our day.  Thus I didn't understand the controversy since the movie makes a joke of Global Warming.

All politics aside, the movie asks us to focus our attention on a father's search for his adult son while the rest of America is essentially being destroyed.  It's a nice relationship that they have but is this how the world ends; not with a bang but with a reunion?

OK, so if you just want to relax your brain and enjoy the special affects that Hollywood can come up with these days, ""The Day After Tommorrow"" is worthwhile to watch.  The kids will love it but I expect a bit more out of a movie than this.",1099785600,,2053,4.553133514986376

It shows two things: 1. that our resources are on the verge of extinction and if we do not continue to watch ourselves, the similar scenario will happen. There will be a second world flood, (although not Biblical and we would not travel in the ark, like Noah did).  Millions of people will die, and the whole world would be devastated.

2. This film also shows the struggle of the main heroes. From that time when Sam decided to stay in the library (that was the only way to survive) to when he saved his girlfriend from dying of pneumonia to waiting patiently for his dad to arrive and rescue them all, this film makes us think about peoples' courage.

Anyway, the movie's not realistic and it makes fun of itself by creating these ironic situations-like everyone evacuating to Mexico.

As far as the message goes, I'm glad it's there... cause you have to admit, we really don't take good care of our environment.  Although it's probably not going to happen overnight, the ice-caps have melted a heck of a lot, and will continue to melt because of the things we do.  Long term effects... who knows?  It'll probably be gradual, but one day it'll come back to bite humanity- probably long after all the people who put us in the predicament have passed away.",1099699200,4,909,4.401197604790419
1556859,3,B00005JMXX,"Global warming is to this generation what nuclear armageddon was to Generation X. Looming ice ages or swamp worlds or runaway greenhouse effect boiling away oceans are all concerns that touch deep within the hearts and instincts of many young people. Movies such as this have the potential to reach inside and really strike fear. It's too bad that this movie went about it in such a ham-fisted manner. If the producers and screenwriters had injected a bit more scientific reality and a bit less familial heroism and youthful romance then it might have been a genre-shaping production. The best comparison is to the asteroid movies Deep Impact and Armageddon. Where Deep Impact had healthy doses of scientific accuracy coupled with very real political scenarios Armageddon was all action and stunts with production values. It's too bad that the inferior Armageddon made more money because it negatively affects the genre by encouraging studios to produce movies in that vein; c.f., The Day After Tomorrow.

WHY YOU SHOULD READ:

This movie ended up catering to a very peculiar audience. If you're a huge eco-monger who loves to talk about how modern civilization is destroying the earth then you'll watch this and probably cheer the bad weather on. There are certainly plenty of greedy, capitalist pigs for you to hate. Similarly, if you love watching those kinds of movies where nature is the big enemy in the stripe of Earthquake, Dante's Peak, and--in particular--The Perfect Storm--then you'll find a lot of appeal. It has all the necessary production values, moderately good acting, and people who engage your sympathy such that you really care whether they live or die. In these limited ways, it's a decent enough movie... we just don't believe it is the kind of movie that will end up being watched over and over again in people's DVD libraries.

WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:

If you loved Deep Impact then don't watch this movie. There is no real scientific accuracy here--none whatsoever. Everything is accelerated and Hollywoodized. This is a movie made to scare young, impressionable people just coming out of elementary school and just going in to middle-school--not for adults. If you're looking to inform yourself in dramatic fashion regarding the potential troubles with global warming then you must seek elsewhere no matter what side of the argument you fall upon. For a much more believable treatise on this subject (though just as heavily politicized) check out the novel by Kim Stanley Robinson: Forty Signs of Rain.

The CGI effects (overall) are some of the best and most effective I have ever seen in a movie of this type.  The acting is solid especially by Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal.  Although the script dialogue wise isn't always up to snuff but this isn't Shakespeare we're talking about here. The set up sequence for the film in the beginning is kinda weak effects wise but not awful.  There is a Dick Cheney character that is interesting and most of the supporting cast is quite good.  The problem with the film and what made me keep it from a five star rating is that it introduced emotionally effective characters like Ian Holm (LOTR, Alien, From Hell) and Adrian Lester (Primary Colors) in the beginning and then dropped them like a hot potato about halfway through the film without any real closure to their subplots.  And this is really the weak link of the film.  But if you can get beyond that I think you will find this film rather enjoyable.  It has to be viewed in comparison to other films of its type in terms of being fairly critical of it like ID4, Emmerich's version of Godzilla, Earthquake, the Airport series and The Towering Inferno.  It isn't better than Towering Inferno in my opinion but it is much better than all those others.  ID4 does have that closure though with all of the supporting characters so it is certainly up for debate.  I give this 3 1/2 out of five.",1099526400,,1476,4.528301886792453

The one thing that I didn't understand was how the father (Dennis Quaid) got from California to New York so quickly, I would have liked the journey to reach his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) to be more adventurous. I mean he drove in a car some of the way, then was forced to walk a portion of the way as well. It would have been more rewarding to the audience if we got to witness the pain and hardship of such a difficult rescue, for all the survival that took place there wasn't a real hero to give the credit to.

1556947,3,B00005JMXX,"Director/Co-writer Roland Emmerich brings to his audience another un-realistic, against-all-odds, action thriller similar to Independence Days' style and typical of Hollywood. This time we are treated to the effects of ""Global Warming"", which causes the antithesis of the common effect you would expect- the freezing of practically the entire northern hemisphere. We are told that this ""Modern Ice Age"" occurs do to the extreme temperature change in the North Atlantic current. The Film's lead actor Dennis Quaid fulfills his role as the ""heroic father"" set on rescuing his son from N.Y.C., which is suppose to be hit by the worst storm that will freeze anything in its path. Jake Gyllenhaal (Qauid's son) leaves the audience into boredom by his lack of acting and believability to the catastrophic situation. Although the film's specials effects are at top notch, there is no excuse to deny the common elements that make a true production: an engaging plot and true acting. However, I do believe that Emmerich does achieve his central message: man's sightlessness of his effect on the environment. We can try to avoid global warming all we want, but the fact is it does pose a problem for our future. Overall, if you want a joyride film full of dazzling effects that is predictable and devoid of good acting, then by all means watch The Day After Tomorrow.

The plot is actually fairly lame; but the incredible disasters that are portrayed on screen are so insanely awesome that the plot no longer became a problem for my judgment. Scarcely a minute in this film is left without a scene of action or a key event, and many times I found myself on the edge of my seat when viewing this movie for the first time in the theater. Additional positive things concerning this film were that not many movies have been made like this one, and that the deaths of certain characters are well planned so that they affect the viewer strongly.

Due to the rapid warming, the polar ice caps begin to split, hail the size of softballs begins to fall in Tokyo, huge tornadoes are spawned over Los Angeles, and a tidal wave with waves as high as the Statue of Liberty engulf New York City.  The after-effects of the storms are perhaps the most catastrophic, as temperature drops of as much as ten degrees per second occur, instantly freezing anyone who ventures outside.

Jack's son Sam, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is in New York City participating in a scholastic competition when the weather starts to change.  Cut off from escape, Sam and a band of fellow survivors take refuge from the tidal wave and ensuing temperature drops and snowfall inside the New York public library.  They survive by burning books inside an old fireplace and eating chips and candy from vending machines.  But, with nowhere to go and no one to rescue them, will they survive or will they all perish from the bitter cold?  Will Jack make it to rescue his son before its too late?  What will become of the people in the southern United States who were evacuated to Mexico?

I'm a big fan of special effects in movies, and this film has some of the best effects I've ever seen before.  Perhaps the best scene of the film is the formation of the tidal wave that slams into New York City.  Watching this wave form and ultimately engulf the Statue of Liberty, which stands well over 800 feet tall, was one of the high points in the movie for me.  The tornado sequences over Los Angeles, and the opening scenes of the fissure cracks at the poles were excellent as well.

That is just a part of the usual Roland Emmerich formula that he uses here. He also loves to blow up helocopters and here he just has them crash and the pilots freeze to death. Plus Dennis Quaid walking from Washington to NY City is about as believeable as Jeff Goldbluim taking down the alien space ship shields with a computer virus in ID4. Everyone that goes outside will freeze to death yet Quaid can surivive just because he is used to cold climates ? Although Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhall are good as father and son it's only the great special effects that save the movie from the silly script.

This film is director/writer/producer Roland Emmerich's baby, and he does give the film some lavish attention to production.  The story isn't too bad, even if it is absolutely unbelievable that the events that unfold happen all at once.  Roland Emmerich, who's best film is still ""Stargate,"" but is mostly remembered for his mega-plex phenomenon, ""Independence Day,"" very nearly gets extra bases for ""The Day After Tomorrow.""  However, the acting is wooden; the characters, two-dimensional.  I could actually see myself watching this film again someday on a rainy afternoon, too feverish to care about acting or the story's plausibility; just soaking up the dazzling special effects and trying to ignore the rest.

1557025,2,B00005JMXX,"well, i was bored, and it was on sale at wal fart, so i put it in the shopping cart, not knowing really what to expect.

I could repeat what a lot of earlier reviewers have already stated about the lack of logic, woody acting, etc., however, i'll decline.

About the best thing about the DVD was the sound.  Whoever created the DTS soundtrack for the movie did an awesome job,
especially with the cold and the wind.

However, the wolves really annoyed me as they had no context in the story whatsoever.  I could understand the animals in the zoo getting upset as supposedly animals know when something's wrong with the weather, but swimming wolves was just too much.  Why did she have to get cut anyway?
also, if i knew, which they did, that i was walking on a building with a glass roof, i would have gotten off of it as soon as i could.  How heroic the guy was to sacrifice himself so the others could survive.
the movie was quite boring.  Unlike his other movie, id4, it was not even interesting the first time you watched it.
oh well.  I like to play it loud, b/c it scares the crap out of my cats.

However, the absolute worst part of this dvd would have to be the ""special features.""  You are out of luck if you don't have a cable/dsl connection AND it is still slow.  They could have put it all on the dvd itself, but i think 20th century fox wanted your name and email address so they could see how many people bought this or something.  these are even worse than the movie itself.",1098835200,3,1489,4.23758865248227
1557026,2,B00005JMXX,"There's no two ways about it...filmmaker Roland Emmerich really despises New York...three of his last four films depict some level of destruction within the Big Apple.  Why does he hate it so?  I have no idea, but he also doesn't seem all that found of Los Angeles, either...

The Day After Tomorrow (2004), written, produced and directed by Roland Emmerich stars Dennis Quaid (who'd been having a really decent run of good films, up until now, that is...), and Jake Gyllenhaal, who seems to bounce between really good movies (Donnie Darko) to really lousy ones (Bubble Boy, Highway).  Also appearing is Emmy Rossum (who bares a remarkable resemblance, at times, to American Pie's Elizabeth Shannon), Jay O. Sanders (Daylight), Perry King (The Lords of Flatbush), Kenneth Walsh (Miracle), Sela `yowsa, yowsa' Ward, and Ian `Bilbo Baggins' Holm.

Okay...Jack Hall (Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist...what's that, you say?  Well, apparently it's someone who studies the weather of the past, using ice core samples from the artic and sophisticated computer programs...more or less a glorified weatherman.  During his research, he's found evidence to support the world is soon (soon meaning anywhere from 100 to 1,000 years) heading for another ice age, but no one is taking him too seriously, especially not the haughty Vice President (Walsh), probably due to the fact the weather reports we get on the TV are usually only right about half the time, so why should we jump through hoops for this clown?  Surprise, surprise, it turns out Walsh is right (but his timing is way off...typical weatherman) as the poopie hits the fan...big time.  Hail the size of footballs in Japan, tornadoes in LA, tide waves and crazy snow in New York (haven't they suffered enough?), all resulting in a global climate change, which doesn't sound all that bad, but basically the entire northern hemisphere is buried under ice and snow...a lot of ice and snow...and temperatures are dropping.  Oh why didn't they listen to Hall?  The fools...the frozen fools...

I will say this...The Day After Tomorrow sported some of the best special effects I've seen in awhile.  The wide scale destruction of major cities was very intense (Irwin Allen, the master of disaster, the man who brought us all those wonderful 70's disaster movie, would have been proud)...also, I thought the acting was passable, which is sad, given the experienced cast involved, but they were just doing what they were told.  If I were to rate this film on the special effects alone, it would be five stars, but I have to also consider the other aspects, the story, the dialog and such.  It's these elements (or lack of) that ultimately derailed the film, for me at least.  Emmerich seems to try and dazzle the audience with glossy special effects in hope we won't put too much thought into all the holes, large and small, that riddle the plot.  I remember when I saw Emmerich's Independence Day (1996) for the first time, I was really taken with the film, but subsequent viewings revealed the paper thin construction, allowing the story to collapse in on itself...here, I need not watch the film again as the flimsy nature came through like a sledgehammer to the head...and Emmerich lays on the schmaltzy, maudlin sentimentality, disguised in the form of altruistic self sacrifice and heroism, about as thick as he lays the snows on New York...I would have thought it difficult to top the gushy, slushy, saccharine sweet goo presented in Independence Day, but I was wrong, as here, he turns it into an art form.  The dialog was just awful...I was surprised some of the actors managed to get their lines out while keeping a straight face.  Also, the dialog was entirely predictable, especially between the pregnant pauses meant to heighten the emotional level for the drivel soon to follow...I actually found myself speaking lines before they were spoken in the film, as it was that obvious as to what was coming.  And the film seems inundated with a preachy smugness...yes, we consume fossil fuels and use resources from the Earth, but does that necessarily make us evil and deserving of the scenario played out in this film?  I love it when Hollywood, in all of its shallow gloriousness, tries to teach the rest of the world what's wrong with us.  This is a big difference between Emmerich and Irwin Allen...Allen made disaster films to engage and entertain, while Emmerich seems to use the medium as a means to tell us the error of our so called destructive ways, and showing the ruinous consequences that result.  Ahh, I've stood on my soapbox long enough...here's some scenes to watch for...the one, after New York is frozen, with the homeless man teaching the rich kid, who normally wouldn't have given the filthy man the time of day, how to use newspapers and such to insulate himself by stuffing them in his clothes...can you see the irony here?  The homeless, once a burden on our society, have now, after the disaster, found purpose in advising the uninitiated on how to survive, as they've had to do living on the mean streets.  Everyone go out and befriend a homeless person now, before it's too late...okay, how about this scene...the kids, now stuck in the Manhattan library after the storm, are scrounging for food, and break into some vending machines.  The homeless guy suggests looking in the trash cans, as there's always something to eat in trash cans (yeah, okay...I'll tell you what my stinky friend, I'll eat the potato chips and M&M's and you can have whatever edible, maggot infested morsels you find rummaging in the garbage)...again, infinitely invaluable advice from the homeless...

I won't bother going into all the special features on the DVD, as this site lists them adequately, but there's really not that much, as you have to link to the meatier features through a weblink provided on the DVD, which seems very cheap and cumbersome...

1557027,3,B00005JMXX,"A good popcorn movie, ""Day After Tomorrow"" features eye-popping special effects and a familiar cast.  Dennis Quad, looking more frozen than all the ice around him, is a scientist who warns the world that hell is about to freeze over.  Great special effects ranging from tormadoes to one huge title wave, and a brisk pace keeps things moving along nicely.  Forget all logic, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1098835200,3,407,4.785714285714286
1557028,3,B00005JMXX,"OVERVIEW: I believe there are two ways to watch ""The Day After Tomorrow"". The 1st way is to go in with lofty expectations and look for real-life happenings backed up by facts and real-world stuff. The 2nd way is to go into this movie not expecting much at all --> hey another Hollywood disaster flick with some cool special effects! I went into this movie with no expectations... and for the most part enjoyed it. The storyline was weak at best, the acting was uninspired, but the movie as a whole was brought together by the terrible weather. Severe ice and snow storms, tidal waves (hence flooding), tornados, and more reaking havoc on planet Earth.

THE GOOD: The special effects were awesome. The huge waves coming into NYC looked incredible. The waves engulfing the Statue of Liberty and taking over the streets were very cool. The numerous high speed tornados in Los Angeles were nicely done, but even the average viewer could tell they were computer generated. The rain and snow looked good and the freezing effects were believeable. Jake Gyllenhaal put in his finest performance since ""October Sky"" (1999).

THE NOT SO GOOD: The cast is weak. Dennis Quaid (as father Jack Hall, special-meteorologist-predictor-guy) is just not on my ""top actors"" list. Quaid is a better ""made-for-TV"" movie actor than one on the big screen (let alone to carry most of the movie). Outside of ""Frequency"", ""The Parent Trap"" and ""The Rookie"", it's been too many years in between since I've really enjoyed one of his movies. Jake Gyllenhaal (""October Sky"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Bubbleboy"") was fine as Sam Hill (the son of Jack) and I truly believe he is an up-and-comer in Hollywood, but, he and his agent just haven't found that next 'right' script. Sela Ward is present briefly as the supportive Hall wife. Other than these 3 movie family members... you won't recognize anyone - the remaining cast of hundreds are no-names. Was Quaid the first choice here, or did every other actor decline the lead role for this movie? There are so many impossible (or nearly impossible) things going on in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" that if you sit and analyze everything that's happening you won't enjoy the movie. For example, after Jack Hall's truck gets stuck in the snow, he decides to trek from Philly to NYC to rescue his son... no small feat to do when the severe cold is killing everyone who walks outside in about 15 seconds. Did anyone mention the distance of 100 miles between the two cities? Or the tennis rackets he duck-taped to his feet so he could walk on the 50-foot snow drifts? The wolves chasing Sam on the ship were notebly exaggerated computer-made knock offs. The tidal wave coming into the city arrived in seconds, yet young Sam could run half a football field and back to save the girl and get back inside before the wave hits them. What about the rest of the world (this movie concentrated solely on America)? It would have been neat to see France's Eiffel Tower blitzed by the deep freeze or at least knocked over by a twister. The list goes on.

MISC: The extras on this DVD are minimal. There are 2 commentaries to choose if that's your thrill. One with director Emmerich. The 2nd with the co-writer, editor and director of photography (yawn!). Did Quaid & Gyllenhaal decline? There are 2 deleted scenes (yawn), and a making-of footage for your PC (what the?). If you're looking for an accurate rendention of the effects of global warming - you'll be sorely disappointed (the Bush administration has not endorsed this movie). Come into this movie with few or no expectations and an eye for some cool weather related special effects and perhaps you'll get more out of it. Rating: A generous 3 stars.",1098748800,4,3697,4.746500777604977
1557029,3,B00005JMXX,"Global warming begins to take a serious turn in Roland Emmerich's roller coaster journey as Mother Nature decides that humans have finally done enough destruction to the Earth.  The temperature begins to raise through global warming which initiates a huge melt down of the ice in the Arctic.  This melt down of ice affects the water temperature in oceans, which leads to changes in the ocean currents.  The ocean currents have a huge impact on the climate throughout the world, which the audience is to witness as Mother Nature kicks humanity's (...)with tornados, hurricanes, typhoons, hail, rain, and temperature shifts.

The climatologist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), has a theory that will lead to a new ice age in the next 100 years or so.  However, the vice president ignores Jack as the precautions that Jack wants would cost too much money and affect the American life style.  What Jack does not know is that Mother Nature has sped up the process as the world is about to see a new ice age within a month that will affect the northern hemisphere.

In the middle of the climate disaster Jack has to face a family crisis as he has neglected his wife as they are separated.  Jack has also neglected his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), as he is constantly traveling around the world in the name of climate science.  This family crisis is what brings the adventure to the film as Sam is stranded in a flooded New York, and Jack realizes that he must do right to his son by keeping his word.  However, the family crisis becomes a banal situation, as the life of Sam seems less worth than Jack's promise.

Day After Tomorrow is a visual popcorn popping roller coaster where the close calls are many and frequent.  The close calls display unearthly hero's that outruns rapid super tides, fast crawling temperature drops of deadly consequence, and long distant snow threading super athletes.  The word cliffhanger had once a meaning, but after the films large number of close calls it becomes a clich.

The Day After Tomorrow begins with a promise of suspense, which it delivers, but to the expense of the story and characters.  The film has superb special effects, e.g., Los Angles being chewed by monstrous tornados and New York being swallowed by the Atlantic Ocean.  However, the story takes a back seat to the special effects and all the close calls, which significantly hurts the films potential.  Nonetheless, Day After Tomorrow offers an decent cinematic adventure that will keep the audience's attentions with excitement and weather bombardment.",1098662400,5,2547,4.858796296296297
1557089,1,B00005JMXX,"I rented and viewed ""The Day After Tomorrow"" recently.

I was bored throughout and would have simply turned it off and hit ""rewind"", had I not paid to see the movie.

I had read nothing but negative reviews of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and had rented it with the intention of setting straight those who were so critical of a movie depicting the nightmare worst case scenario of global warming--something I consider to be a real possibility.

Sadly, I must now join the chorus of critics of Roland Emmerich's latest cliche-ridden disaster flick.

The film is characterized by a suffocating concoction of dauntless American heroism and sappy traditional home and family values rubbed into the viewer's nose ad nauseum--a reflection, no doubt, of the mood now prevalent in this nation.

There is also excessive Hollywood style special effect sock, bang and pow noise and violence where a thoughtful examination of the very real issue of global warming might have been more helpful.

Additionally, as per Hollywood's stock in trade formula, inordinately intelligent African Americans spout endless profundities, while no Native American, Hispanic or Arab American says or does anything noteworthy.

There is even a quasi-supernatural demonization of escaped zoo wolves at one point to further annoy the thoughtful viewer.

And a child-like PG 13 rendition of a sanitized hand-holding romance between two brainy students is as near as the movie comes to anything romantic.

Global warming is a serious and pressing problem for the human species--one made more so by the Bush administration's refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol.

But Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow""--a movie that could have been a great teaching tool--so trivializes the issue that the cause of enlightenment about the perils of global warming may have been done more harm than good.

I was very disappointed by ""The Day After Tomorrow"".

1557090,1,B00005JMXX,"What a great shame - all the hype about this movie seemed too good to be true - it's great how only the best bits of a film are ever only shown on the trailers - as i remember it was s short trailer at the time !

It's easy sometimes to overlook an inplausible story line and blank out odd errors in a movie - but after watching this movie for the first time last week and waiting so long to see it after missing it at the movies - i was toatlly disappointed !

The storyline was very weak , with totally unrealistic characters - a very friendly Mexican neighbour that quadrupled it's population overnight because the mighty Americans said they would forget their debts - i think after this massive ice sheet had had destroyed America - Mexico would have been the new super power in the region !! But quite happily the Mexicans allowed not only the civilian population of America to enter the country but what looked like an a whole regiment or more of heavily armed troops - with refugee camps able to talk to manned space stations - wonderful technology .

It's a pity that Dennis Quaid picked the same partner to go across the frozen savannah of America with the same guy he went to Antarctica with - only this time his partner couldn't make it - obviously harder terrain across the USA to NY .

It was so nice to see all those people on the top of the sky scrapers when the helicopters came - all safe - i wonder what they used , to keep warm in those buildings - no big Victorian fireplaces to burn books in like the library .

Wolves running free across NY - it never did explain who ripped their cage apart and freed them .

I thought it very kind of Dennis Quaid to start the trek back from whence he came across the frozen wastes - him all covered up in warm protective clothes while his son and his friends were in old overcoats and normal shoes ?? I didn't see em with any provisions either ??

A cloud mass that covered the entire globe - then it disappeared as fast as it came - very convenient !

That had to be the slowest tidal wave ever that hit NY - it seemd to take just the right amount of time for our young hero to save the girl and hide in the library - with no structural damage at all to any buildings - not deep enough to go above the first floor of the library / then he wouldn't have found a working phone in the basement / but just deep enough for an unmanned Russian cargo ship to navigate it's way through the streets of NY - the same Russian ship that conveniently had a ready supply of penicillin in the medicine cabinet . I am not going to go on any more - i have relieved a lot of amy anger at the movie here already - all i can say is , if you all you care about are a few special effects that last about 20 minutes in total and nothing else - buy this film / otherwise beware - you could get as frustrated as me watching it drone on for nearly 2 hours .",1098662400,8,2890,4.057894736842106

Here's the plot: global warming affects the Atlantic currents (possible) and that affects the temperature (possible) which causes the world to delve into an ice age in a matter of days, sending us all the citizens of the Northern Hemisphere begging for shelter in the Third World (possible if you drink enough).  Every home should have a copy.  And, they say our math and science status continually slips!  Just wait till the world sees this baby.......",1098662400,,592,4.821782178217822

1557094,3,B00005JMXX,"To watch this movie at all, one must first accept that the scenario presented here is possible. We aren't going to have an instant ice age due to a spontaneous climactic shift, but in this movie, that is exactly what happens, and the predictable high jinx ensue.

This is a special effects extravaganza, and little else. The plot and characters don't matter because you've seen it all before, and you know how it will end. It's a disaster movie, and you know what's going to happen to each and every person by the time you are introduced to them because this movie follows the basic formula.

Is it entertaining? Absolutely. I am not a fan of movies that have such little substance, but this one is at least a treat to the eyes and it is not overly graphic in cases where it could have turned the movie into a gory experience.

Is it deep? Does it say something important about global warming? No. I think it tries to, and even the vice president has an eerie resemblance to environment hating Dick Cheney, but the entire message is lost as we watch New York get flooded with a tsunami and a mass exodus of Americans start flooding into Mexico.

1557095,3,B00005JMXX,"I would actually give this about 3 & 1/2 stars, but this really would have been a better movie if it was presented as a ""what if"" documentary instead of trying so hard to be an epic. The special effects are best on the big screen. It tries to answer the question ""what is global warming and what could happen if it goes unchecked?"" What if the effects were not going to take 100 or 1,000 years to show up, what if they happened the day after tommorow? It actually gives some explanations about how the climate works and definitions of how it's affected by warming and what could happen eventually that are worth knowing about. They try to humanize the special effects with stories about people caught in the various storms. They focus mainly on Dennis Quaid's family: he's been trying to ring the warning bells without sucess for a long time and then it's too late, his son is stuck in N.Y. as the storm hits, he tries to overcome impossible odds to get to his son, his estranged wife is a doctor who refuses to leave a very young cancer patient alone in a hospital, his son is trying to survive a the ""storm of the century"" with his friends. The real problem with this movie is that there is too much going on for it to be as tightly focused as it needs to be because they're trying too hard to make both an ecological and political statement.

It also features a younger President with an older V.P., who feel the economic cost of doing something about global warming is too high to warrant action, especially since it can't be determined exactly what will happen and when. Does that sound at all familiar to you? The only things missing were a Presidental/V.P financial stake in the continued high use of fossil fuels and a seven minute shot of the President sitting in a chair looking dumbfounded when he heard about the devastation in New York. But then it would just have been Fahrenheit -911 instead.

Those with a child-like wish to have the President pay for his mistakes and see the VP both admit to and apologize for his mistakes (instead of saying ""go #&@$ yourself"") may be gratified by this movie. I'm glad I saw it, I get the dangers of global warming, but it's jut not a ""must buy"" movie for me.",1098576000,11,2211,4.416666666666667

One of the best films in which Dennis Quaid starred in very long time.  The movie is, of course, effects-driven, but that doesn't take away from the film.  Just watching that huge tidal wave hit New York was damn spectacular! On a poltical note, it was kinda funny to se the vice-president character made to look and sounds so much like our current VP:  potty-mouth Cheney.

To start, save your money and rent this if you haven't seen it.  There were some good scenes and special effects, but the movie goes wrong with its focus on Sam and his dad.

Sam's dad starts out from Washington, in a blizzard, to go to New York to save Sam, and ends up walking the last 40 miles to get there.  Yep, only Sam's dad can save him, not the cops, not the army, only superhero dad...

And, did Sam's dad bring an extra snowsuit for Sam to make the trip back in?  No.

And why should we care about Sam anyway?  People are dying in New York left, right, and centre, but as long as Sam makes it back you are supposed to feel good.

One flaw in the plot is that it blames humans on global warming, when actually this kind of climatic change will happen/is happening because of regular cyclical solar weather and earth magnetic pole changes (although we should be conscious of not exacerbating or speeding up the process through our own pollution). If we just look at what was happening geologically 10,000 years ago on this planet, then we can see that these types of Earth changes are just part of the deal here on this planet.

The scary thing is that something like this can and probably will happen, although doubtfully within a couple of weeks like it did in this movie! Still, it gives a lot of food for thought for anyone who is fascinated by the coming Earth changes we are already seeing evidence of during our own times through stronger and more frequent hurricanes and earthquakes and greater volcanic activity.

Regardless of the science, though, this movie is highly entertaining and fast-paced; extremely enjoyable to watch.

Intact mammoths have been found frozen before they could begin to decompose and with food still in their mouths. The ""Oceanic Conveyor belt"" has slowed 20% since 1950.  The ""Greenland Iceshelf"", which 'feeds' it, has failed to form 5 of the last 7 years.  London is in the same latitude as Moscow.  The only reason eastern and northern Europe has a temperate climate is because of the Oceanic Conveyor belt, the South and North Atlantic currents and others.  The artic ice is melting at an alarming rate exposing the warmer water beneath it, which is further warming and melting the arctic ice and affecting the North Atlantic Currents.  The antarctic ice shelves are disappearing.  One shattered completely... in '99?... to the shock and suprise of scientists who would have believed it impossible for such a large expanse of ice to disappear that fast.

1557161,4,B00005JMXX,"I have to say that after the cool reception of the film by critics and viewers alike, I wasn't expecting much. So, I was quite surprised when I found to be liking the movie a lot more than I had originally intended. I am a sucker for a good adventure/action film, and who doesn't love it when it is a giant disaster flick?. Director Roland Emmerich gave us the hit ""Independence Day"", but then again, he also unleashed the horror of ""Godzilla"" on us as well. Here, he delivers a pretty solid, interesting, human, and exciting tale of mother nature gone awry. Dennis Quaid stars as Jack Hall, a climatologist working for the government, who is at odds with his son Sam, who is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The strained father and son relationship is put to the test when the earth is hit by global warming that puts everything and everyone in danger. Tornados level Los Angeles, including some nifty scenes of the Hollywood sign and Tower Records, and cause a flooding of New York City and so on. Jack is stuck in Washington D.C., and son Sam is holed up with some friends and other New Yorkers in a museum in New York City. Sam being there for a school affair with his friend, and female companion who, not surprisingly, he longs for. Other typical characterizations of people litter the crowds of trapped city goers. The first hour sets up the severity of the storms and the destruction and isolation, while the second half spends the rest of the movie with our trapped cast fighting to stay alive from the ever dangerous weather. It is nice to see Dennis Quaid in such a film. I have always liked him and his work, and have always felt he was underrated and overlooked a bit in the grand scheme of things. He's a good actor. It is surprising to see smaller, indie-type actor Gyllenhaal in one. I haven't seen most of his work, but I do like him. He does just fine here. If he had done ""Spider-Man 2"" because of Tobey's back injury, it might of been okay after all. Both fit pretty well here. Emmerich's movies are always made for the effects and overal epic-ness of it all, and this one is no exception. The father-son storyline isn't a new one, and there is nothing here that adds to the overused plot line, or enhances it. Surprisingly, at least to me, it wasn't tne needless, thankless, lame plot ploy that a lot of people thought it was. I liked it, and it worked for me for some reason. The effects and destruction are quite a spectacle. That is for sure. The New York devastation more so than Los Angeles or anything else. Who doesn't want to see a ship harbored in a hustling section of downtown New York?. The effects are wild indeed, but seem more settled and level than those in Roland' previous opus'. If that makes any sense. While the effects and all that are great, fun to watch, and what most people are only interested in, I found myself being more interested and involved with the second half of the film. Watching everyone trying to live, and Jack trying to trek to New York to resuce his son. Ian Hol, famous from ""Alien"", has a supporting role here as a Professor. Also expect to see Sela Ward, who has a rather small role as Jack's ex-wife and Sam's mother, who is trapped in the hospital she works at. And Perry King also appears in the film, albeit a small role, as The President Of The United States. It's harmless fun that is definitley fun and entertaining to watch. The scariest thing about the film is that it leaves you with a question....what if?.",1098316800,,3477,4.45141065830721

1557163,3,B00005JMXX,"*Lookout Spoilers Ahead* I love disaster movies, Twister, Deep Impact, Armageddon, all got just average reviews, but to the real people, the ""customers"", most of us liked them all. The Day After Tomorow falls into that category. The problem with this movie is that I wanted more. There were just too many loopholes, too many unanswered questions, and some logic issues that I didn't quite understand.

My issues with the movie are simple, they left you with too many unanswered questions and logic that left me bewildered? Fisrt of all, what year is this movie taking place? Present? 2009? 2030? Please tell me mister director?

Issue #1, What happened to the thousands of people who traveled from the library to find shelter? And speakin of shelter? Where did they think they would go in an ice age blizzard anyway? They didn't show much panic considering that 95% of the population of New York perished in the tidal wave. Aside from panic, we didn't see much remorse, tears, or sadness for the horrible events from anybody, they just seemed ""to not mesh with the emotion that the audience was feeling with all the death that just occured. And don't the survivors have families? Aren't they concerned for their well being too? No mention of concern for that.

Issue #2: Perhaps a little more ""heart"" for everything would have made us care for the characters more. Although The story of Dennis Quaid searching for his son is touching to a point, it really had nothing to do with the large scale mayhem in the movie. Even more crazy, is the improbable fact that he actually found him within a short period of time. And this is during a developing ice age?  Once again, they need to keep you up to speed with the time gone by and where we're at during the film. But nonetheless, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out it would have taken weeks to find him in the aftermath of the storm.

Issue #3: The incredible sequence when the -150 degree drop at the library was so far fetched! Since when can you out run mother nature within inches? They turned it into a track and field race to see if they could beat the cold air to the library lobby?  And how are these people surviving with no water and food? With the -150 degree temperature outside, water, food, would be totally useless frozen up in ice. How did they survive? How can the penecillin they picked up on the ship be useful if it's frozen like a popcicle? I just needed more information for everybody's survival? And those mystery wolves? Did they make a fire to keep warm during the blizzard and end up chasing the characters after it was ok to go outside?

Issue #4: What exactly happened to the President of the United States and his boys? They made ""one short"" issue of it during the movie. Where is the President? ""They didn't make it"" the white house staff responds. Ok, so???--- they didn't make it? But why? Snow? Ice? Flood? Shot down my Iraqi soldiers? I just was left hanging! Maybe they will have a directors cut and explain everything.

With all the loopholes in logic,  I still enjoyed the movie, I just wish the creators would have explained things better and fixed some of the logic in the movie.

I guarantee though,  you're not going to be disappointed with the special effects, even the critics can't bash this to the ground, because the computer imagery is eerily realistic and will scare you out of your wits. Although after watching 9/11, I really was left with a chill seeing New York hit with a giant tidal wave and knowing the people who perished. Overall the acting is fine, Dennis Quaid is your typical ""caring father"" character. But a little more emotion and sadness by everyone would have had a bigger impact on movie goers. If you leave your expectations a bit low, you should really enjoy this ""no brainer"" movie.",1098316800,4,3811,4.597938144329897

When you rented or bought this movie, what exactly were you looking for?  If you want realistic, true to life stuff, go to the Discovery or Weather Channel.  This is fiction, people, and I for one didn't buy it to see any extraordinary acting or plotline.  I wanted to see the effects...hail as big as grapefruits; tornadoes ravaging Los Angeles; New York flooding and freezing.  That's why I bought this movie and was not the least bit disappointed.  Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward, Dash Mihok, Kenneth Welsh, Jake Glyenhaal, Emmy Rossum...they all did fine, because they knew the audience would root for them no matter how ridiculous their dialogue was.

1557236,3,B00005JMXX,"I recently saw this film for the first time on DVD and really enjoyed it. I even considered buying a copy of the movie, but have decided against it at this time for a couple of reasons:

1. Judging by the extras being offered (which weren't many), I can't help but think there will be a `special edition' somewhere down the line. After reading what is going to be included on the European DVD release, I definitely believe they will do another edition somewhere down the line. From what I read, the two-disc European edition will include A LOT of behind-the-scenes documentaries and featurettes detailing the movie's production and special effects as well as a storyboard gallery and a concept art gallery. Apparently this release will also include over 10 deleted scenes as opposed to the two on the current U.S. release. There is also a feature on the scoring of the movie with composer Harald Kloser. There will a section of the science and politics of some of the themes presented in the movie. There is also a section with artistic impressions of how a number of cities around the world would look if they were caught up in the climate changes presented in the movie. THESE ARE THE KIND OF EXTRAS I WOULD WANT IF I WAS GOING TO BUY THIS MOVIE ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2. Throughout the commentaries, Roland Emmerich and many people involved with this film talked about shots they wanted that didn't make it into the film because effects shots were not able to be completed on time. If this movie makes the kind of money I think it will on DVD, I hope Fox will offer Emmerich some money to finish some of those shots and create a `director's cut' of this movie. Hey, Emmerich did so with STARGATE and INDEPENDENCE DAY which I thought made them better movies, why can't he do it with this one?

I think I will hold off buying this movie until a `special edition' comes out. I will only buy it when it does.",1098230400,3,1920,4.559420289855073

1557239,2,B00005JMXX,"Although my rating for this is 2 stars - one of my lowest ratings ever for a DVD - I'm going to be up front with you, be honest and say:  This movie MAY be right up your alley.  It really depends on how willing you are to overlook a story that could have been written by a high school prom committee that suddenly found themselves in possession of several cameras and 50 million dollars worth of special effects.

You've HEARD (or read) the plot outline, right?  New Ice Age comes and covers most of the Northern Hemisphere and a handful of smart/brave Americans save..... well, they don't save all of the Northern Hemisphere, but they at least save themselves.

Dennis Quaid is a good and reliable actor, and in some roles I can readily accept him.  As an almost-washed-up Texas High School Baseball coach I buy it.  As one of the ""Cutters"" in ""Breaking Away"", he was powerful and brooding.  In ""Day"" he plays basically the genius scientist who predicts disaster but those dummies in the government don't believe him.  Not only was it hard for me to believe him in this role - I kept telling myself that it is a pretty weak ""save the world"" movie that essentially uses a weatherman as it's hero.

Ian Holm is absolutely fantastic and totally believable as an ally weatherman over in Britain, but Sir Ian's screen time is minimal and his character disappears before the 2nd act, never to be heard from again.

The ""star"" of the movie, of course, are the special effects, and they LOOK good.  But while I'm watching a guilty-pleasure extended sequence where a whole herd of tornadoes waltz through Los Angeles I was thinking....""just HOW was it that global warming causing disturbances in the polar ice cap and North Atlantic caused tornadoes in Southern California?""

I'd buy ""El Nino"" or the recent string of Hurricanes through Florida first.

The ""fun"" parts of this movie could have been condensed into a 15 minute special effects extravaganza and left out the absolutely ludicrous and impossible stories about our heroes and their impossible survival through a cold front so cold that earlier in the movie 3 British Helicopters are frozen in mid-air and crash - just from the cold.  To emphasize how cold it is one of the crewmen starts clawing his way out of the downed chopper, before freezing solid beginning at the tip of his nose.

Our little band of characters, the ones we KNOW are going to ""make it"" not only live through that wave of cold air - but there are scenes where we see them running ahead of the freeze.... in sort of the same way teenagers flee from Jason in the Friday 13th movies.

So.... if you want to see a lot of North America wiped out by bad weather - you've come to the RIGHT movie.  If you insist that your movies make logical sense.... keep on moving folks, there's nothing to see here.",1098144000,5,2820,4.572564612326044
1557240,5,B00005JMXX,"It's a Popcorn film. It's big, it's blustery, and it's a way to while away some time with some great ""gosh-golly-gee-whiz"" views and FX.
I thoroughly enjoyed Ian Holm, his performance, as well as various others were typically excellent.
I absolutely love the Cheney clone, and the dig at the view about the ""Kyoto"" accord. But if the best that people who claim to be conservatives can say is that it is ""liberal rubbish"" ... what I want to know is ... Why do you watch this material ??
If you have a surround sound system, crank up the levels, and this DVD is absolutely great. An absolutely superb ride.

Worth every penny ( Especially at Wally Worlds Prices :-)

AFTER SEEING ALL THE MATERIAL  AGAIN:

How anyone could approach this film as a ""message""  film is beyond me.
The Special  effects are brilliant, and work superbly. And eveything works around the FX. The commentarys do a brilliant job of illuminating how this work came together, and whilst there are elements of a ""message"", it is so hidden, as to be irrelevant. There are even notional political elements, but once again, if you watch this movie for some sort of political pot shots, you should really go in for analysis. Its pure ( or, ""impure"") entertainment, and thats where it excels  better than most disaster type films that Roland  Emmerich  does. Its not that the Emmerich family can't do decent pieces which have some depth ( FREQUENCY for example), it's just that when a film is done on this scale, they obviously want to make a BIG lot of dollars, so its lowest common denominator time, and its a  rare  film that can do both message, and mega-dollar  deals. This is another of the grand popcorn films. There are sequences in this film that are just eye popping in visual stuns, but if you want illumination about what the world of humans is doing to the planet, search elsewhere... this is a vacation from reality, not a reality tour-de-force.
Anyway, its Damn fine fun, and brilliant at that.",1098144000,,1972,4.635057471264368

Its a 2 hour movie but you never get that when is this going to end feeling....the first hour is really good with the storyline strictly on the event..the 2nd hour turns into a story of survival for a group of people hiding in the NY library.

The special effects are great and the footage of news reporters describing the disaster gives an authentic look at what could happen in the future in our world.

The only part I found a bit over the top was the wolves chasing the 3 guys as they go for medicine...that was a bit much....but overall I was entertained by the movie and thought it was a good two hours of fun.

In the film, a news crew flying in a helicopter reports on the twisters that are popping up all over town.  Mind you, there flying amidst the twisters instead of wathing them from a safe distance away.  Not even storm chasers would do something so looney.

Dennis Qaid gives the finest performance a piece of driftwood can give.  Emotionless and expressionless is what I would call him here.  He's got all the excitement of a hangnail.  Of course he's the smartest man on the planet but the President of the United States doesn't listen to him.

This is your usual, my dad never spends time with me, I'm a teenager feeling sorry for myself, I'm so misunderstood, I don't have any friends, oh no my kid's in trouble I've got to rescue him because I can do what no other man in the world can do becasue I'm so brave story, (yawn).

But,....trying to take this movie seriously is actually hard. The story revolving around global warming and the world being hit hard within a week is a bit too hard to swallow. Too, there's just some things in the movie that I just don't see happening quite the same way if they were to happen in real life. I'm not saying that we shouldn't take the threat of global warming seriously but the way it is presented in this movie is ridiculous. If the writer of the film took more time to research the material on global warming, I think he(and Roland Emmerich) could have made an even better film. As much as I love disaster flicks(having collected the majority of them that has come out in recent memory), I really don't know if I could recommend this one for people to buy.

Well, the special effects did not disappoint, but they were not enough to carry this movie into the blockbuster area and my DVD collection. In this technology age, there are plenty of movies with special effects accessibility. But budgets can cut into the writer's script research. Special effects should enhance the believability of a movie script.  It should not try to carry a movie.  The movie must have at least a good plot. The Day After Tomorrow disappointed me in this must do area. Can we believe that global warming will dive us into the ice age within a week? (Days) Is an instant freeze within a hurricane like storm that rotates and then dissipates into nothing possible? Would this only affect North America?  This movie does nothing to answer any scientific questions. There are so many loopholes in this movie it could become a trivia question on How not to write a movie script. Can you count them?

This movie's budget is all special effects.  If you want to see Los Angeles/Hollywood sign destroyed on purpose by tornadoes and New York in a hell freeze rent this DVD.

The movie fails to depict the true ramifications of such a climate upheaval: Society would end and a new ""Dark Age"" would ensue. Billions of people would die, not just from the weather but from starvation and the wars that would follow.

The dialogue had me wishing I hadn't bought the supersize popcorn and soda. The movie had no convincing drama and the characterization was tired and worn.

Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall a climatologist who predicts the devastating effects of global warming which he thinks ist still hundreds of years away.  Nope...try days.  The Atlantic tides have a drastic increase in temperature with immediately start causing catastrophic weather around the world including baseball sized hail in Japan and tornados in LA, and New York hit first with torrential rains and then a huge tidal wave which floods the city so much that freighters go floating down the street....yeah right.

Any way, Hall's son Sam just happens to be in NY for an academic competition and he along with several friends takes refuge from the storm in the NYC public Library.  Why the Library is picked over much taller buildings is anyone's guess but of course with all the books, it makes great fuel for the fireplace as the sole means of warmth.

The eye of the storm causes the temperature to drop to -150 degrees...freezing people where they stand.  Jack decides to set out from Washington DC to rescue his son and two collegues join him.  Their van crashes outside of Philadelphia...so they decide to walk...to NY....from Philadelphia...in sub-zero temps...and sleep at night in a tent...OK....

Director Roland Emmerich is the same guy who brought us Independence Day a few years back.  Another spectacular looking but ridiculous film.  Emmerich sure does love destroying LA though.

The effects are pretty cool to see, but there's nothing we haven't seen before in movies like Twister, or Deep Impact.  The plot is just so inconceivalbe that I just rolled my eyes through most of the non-sense.

And the dad (Dennis Quaid) who is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, does a great job in making this film more interesting despite a soso script.

1557311,2,B00005JMXX,"For me, ""The Day After Tomorrow"", a doomsday epic about the sudden onset of a new Ice Age in the present day, is a disappointment from writer/director Roland Emmerich. His 1994 sci-fi epic, ""Stargate"" is one of my favorite flicks in that genre. His 1996 effort, ""Independence Day"" is immensely entertaining.

The special effects in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" rival [and sometimes outdo] Emmerich's previous efforts. The problems are in the story. ""Stargate"" and ""Independence Day"" were both about mankind's doing battle with alien beings. Since the vast majority of us have never met an alien being, the logic of stories of such encounters is acceptable. What proof do we have to the contrary? The adversary in ""Tomorrow"" is Mother Nature, a force we are all familiar with. Suddenly, she has decided to unleash her full fury on us. Unlike alien invasions, though, we are all aware of Nature's wrath, albeit on a smaller scale.

As the movie moves a long, the scenario gets less and less plausible. For example, the movie blames our leaders for ignoring global warming [a position that is likely true], thus igniting a sudden Ice Age, yet fails to resolve why this event has occurred countless times in the past, with no human intervention.

The other problem with the script is that Emmerich seems to have lost his tongue-in-cheek humor. ""Tomorrow"" is relentlessly earnest. This is essentially the story of a dour-faced father [Dennis Quaid] determined to rescue his equally sullen son [Jake Gyllenhaal], who is trapped in a super-blizzard of epic proportions in New York City. The triumph of love over adversity is a time-honored one in movies, but here it plays out as hollow and predictable, as well as a bit boring.

The movie is another example of modern special effects playing a disproportionate role. Early in the movie, Los Angeles is devastated by a hurricane that spawns a series of devastating tornadoes. Visually, this is by far the movie's best segment. The story never once returns to this catastrophe, instead concentrating only on the New York story. So, why was the LA portion even in the movie? Because highly sophisticated computer special effects deemed that it could be?",1097971200,,2190,4.975409836065574

1557364,3,B00005JMXX,"STORY: Due to ""environmental abuse"" by mankind, the Earth reacts by making the shift into a new ice age

MY FEEDBACK:

1)Disappointed in some of the special effects. Some of them looked pretty cheesy for today's technology. Some scenes, on the other hand, were pretty cool...more in their concept vs. their delivery.

2) Not the same emotional pull as with Deep Impact, but better than Armegeddon. Made me care about the characters a bit

3) I personally don't like movies like War of the Worlds where there is very little mankind does (or can do) to fight back. This misses the heroic element in the face of the overwhelming odds.

This movie falls into that realm for me. It is just a matter of mankind ""riding out the storm"" vs. with Deep Impact and Armegeddon (two recent disaster flicks) where mankind actually tried to fight back. But...they try and make up for it with the character played by Dennis Quaid, which didn't leave me totally feeling jipped as a viewer.

4) As with most Hollywoodish disaster flicks, there are definite breaks in the logic or continuity of the story. This movie is no exception, but the mishaps are somewhat forgiveable

5) Content was clean as far as no rememberable profanity, no sex or nudity and very low key violence. Most of the deaths are left for you to fill in the blanks even though there was about three where bodies are being crushed or destroyed by some other force of nature

There have been a few movies made involving natural diasters but this one is the best.  If you have not seen it yet, definitely watch it.

However, that's about all that's scientifically accurate in this movie.  Yes, these things will happen if we don't do something, but it'll take quite a lot longer than two weeks.  Say, at least a few thousand years.

However, if you can dismiss your disbelief long enough to sit back and enjoy the movie, you won't be disappointed.  Ignore the badly written script, ignore the poorly developed characters.  In fact, you could go as far as to say that the characters really aren't developed at all.

But, man, what's better than seeing LA just completely demolished by a super outbreak of tornados?

1557369,1,B00005JMXX,"Wow, after watching this movie, I was suprised that the name Jerry Bruckheimer wasn't listed after director in the credits.  In truth, this movie is actually worse than the usual disaster movie.  Bland and predictable dialogue combined with a wildly uncredible storyline make this movie hard to watch til the end.  The lack of a storyline wouldn't be such a negative for this disaster movie if the action didn't become stale and predictable halfway through.  About mid way through, this movie becomes more of a comedy in that you will start to laugh about how bad it is (ie.  ""I'm coming for you, regardless of the instant freezing and hundred mile walk in blizzard conditions""...lol).  Essentially what this movie lacked was a climatic environmental challenge.  You never really get the sense that the characters are being effected by their surroundings (nor do you care when some of them are).  The director should have realized when he was filming this that if you need to add something like killer wolves escaped from the zoo to add on to your elemental disaster, you're elemental disaster isn't thrilling enough.  What really hit me as comical is the way the director actually tries to make some kind of comment about taking care of the environment at the very end (through the one character he's built as the ""bad guy"" nonetheless).  In the end, this movie is nothing more than a hollow tribute to how much money movie executives can throw at a poorly written disaster film.",1097884800,7,1480,4.837301587301587
1557370,1,B00005JMXX,"Let's see, divorced couple reignites their passion in the face of disaster, and young people find each other just when it seems too late.  Wasn't this the personal angst we were supposed to identify with in Independance Day and the Patriot (oh wait, that wasn't his ex-wife, it was his sister-in-law who just looked exactly like his ex-wife.  The Revolution pre-dated no fault divorce!)

I'm sorry.  I really tried.  I couldn't accept the characters.  (Sam and his nerd buddies can do calculus in their head, but can't figure out that their might be food and fuel in the ship outside their window.  The librarians decry the burning of books for warmth, but neglect to chop up the wooden furniture that is all over the library, that, btw, would have burned far slower!)

I couldn't accept the situations.  (For example, why did the pediatrician have to wait in the darkened hospital.  Why not just take what the child needed and go in another vehicle and transfer him to an ambulance later?)

I couldn't accept the scientific basis (If the Troposphere is 150 degrees below zero, why don't we have frozen chunks of gas floating above our heads.  Why do we have to wait for meteors from outer space when we can just watch them form in our own atmosphere!)

In fact, I think that Roland should use his vast array of scientific know how and create a sequel that allows the government to thaw all their flash frozen citizens.  Oh wait.  Somebody already made encino man.",1097884800,12,1464,4.686274509803922
1557371,3,B00005JMXX,"Ok as with most of Roland's movies the premise is great yet mid-way through one can see not much thought was put into it.  For example:
  An Alien civilization that is capable of travelling Light years, has a fleet of ships that is capable of destroying cities with a beam, has a force field that can withstand bombs, and their first intent?  DESTROY NEW YORK CITY!!!!  But wait the Earth and Mankind is saved by a drunken pilot and lo and behold Jeff Goldblum who infects their super computer with a laptop running Windows 95!!!  Ok waste of $$$ Maybe next time?

  OH NO!!!  A Lizard that is made by nuclear tests (Godzilla) and what does he decide to destroy?  Ummm NEW YORK CITY maybe?

Well the only saving grace for Roland thus far was The Patriot.  So he did good with that one.  But this movie The Day After Tomorrow brings him back down.

Ok it is a good idea.  Global Warming and the destruction of yes you guessed it... NEW YORK CITY.  What is wrong with Roland and New York?  But it gets better.  You have snow in India ok... skull crushing hail in Japan that happens during a common thunderstorm ummm ok...and tornadoes in Los Angeles that just happens to tear down the Hollywood sign...ummmmmmm ok.  But the storms grow to epic sizes and a wave comes in off the Atlantic Ocean.  Now stay with me here.  The Statue of Liberty is 305 feet from the ground to the tip of the torch, the wave that came in was about 50 feet below the torch.  Let us give Roland the benefit of the doubt and say the wave is 200 feet high.  Moves in towards New York from the Statue to NYC in a few seconds and this distance and this distance is approximately 1/2 a mile.  It reaches Manhattan and takes about 5 minutes to get mid way up the Island of NYC but gives Jake just enough time to save his girl and get in the Public Libraary (even though the wall of water is about 2 blocks away).  Oh I forgot to mention the escape of the computer wolves.

  Jake calls his father to see what he can do and although he is in a huge area of the library they act as if he can not swim out of the little area he is on the phone with his father as the water floods in.
(Now the part that made this movie a comedy in my opinion)  The cold that can freeze you solid in a few seconds.  This sounds as outlandish as the starving, badly made, escapee wolves that are out for blood after a few hours of freedom.  I am sorry for being technical and scientific but I do not know of a temperature on Earth cold enough to freeze clothed, warm blooded life in a matter of seconds.  But we are told this by the same guy that wants us to believe that Will Smith can knock out and kill an Alien with one punch.

  ANYWAY!  Jake is chased by the all enveloping ice that is closing in on him from all directions with the exception of the path he is on.  Quaid finds him under the frozen ocean that... wait, how does 200 feet of water freeze instantly before the really cold air hits?  OH it must have been the 180 inches of precipitation that fell overnight?  Yes the 15 feet of snow that fell in Europe tells about how 200 feet of water can freeze instantly before the air is cold enough to freeze people instantly.  It has to get better right?

  WAIT!  IS THAT IT?  It is over?  Astronauts on a space station see that the clouds are breaking up?  That is it?  Well Roland once again dropped the ball on what could have been an epic movie.  What can he ruin the next time?

  Hey Roland if you are reading this how about this: Evolution gave Lizards, and Mammals a shot at living and they failed.  So now it is time for the Insects.  Due to over population in humans our food supplies run short and a virus breaks out.  We are so closely cramped the virus spreads like wildfire.  The insects eat the humans and grow exponentially from all of the meat.  From eating human brains they gain the ability to think.  They grow to epic proportions about 100 feet in length and decide to fly inland from the Atlantic ocean.  First stop?  Come on need I say?  New York City!  Flying in from they pass the Statue of Liberty at over 300 MPH in a swarm never seen before.  They reach lower Manhattan in one second but the hero sees them come in and runs away to safety just as the insects take their sweet time covering land.  His job was to work at the CDC and he was working on a vaccine made from spider venom.  He then flies an Apache Helicopter that he found in a junkyard to spread the vaccine that will do two things: Kill the insects AND save mankind!  Give me a call Roland ok?  Have your people contact my people and we can work on yet another ridiculous plot.  Or how about Aliens that can be invisible yet come to a planet (unprotected) that is 75% water even though the Water kills,,, oh wait another one that ruins ideas already ruined that one.

1557444,2,B00005JMXX,"This could have been a good film, if not for the characters.

The caring-nurse-mother was one aspect I found irritating.  The fact that they included in a storyline that with all the havoc going on in the movie - she still had enough care and love in her heart to look after the kid with cancer who can't read.  I mean, that's a very nice thing to do, but I felt that it made the mother character come off as way too nice, to a sickening level.

I found the mother character very annoying because she's seen as quite the caring lady -- but then she constantly puts a guilt trip on her husband about not being there with their kid.  I thought she was evil in that way because her husband wanted to be there all the time, but because of his job - he couldn't!  It was very neurotic of her.  She put such a guilt trip (for who knows how many years) on him, that the ending result is him feeling like he needs to travel north to New York, to make it up to him.  ""Yeah, I'm sorry son that my job prevents me from seeing you...but at least we'll die together.""  Of course he loves his son, is this the only way he can make things up to his wife and son?  Sorry, I found it very stupid.

Now I know those two paragraphs are going to make me come off as uncaring, but it really ruined the movie for me and my friends.  And could their son be anymore of a geek?  I mean an over-use of family values and romance in programs really kills the heart of the show.  What's the moral of the story?  With all the disaster surrounding us, family togetherness can still matter?

I'm sorry, but this could have been a cool movie. Going for heart-warming tales in dire situations.  It seems like the writers are trying to please the fans and critics too much.  The illusion of 'we can overcome anything together'.  I guess I held my hopes too high for this picture.",1097712000,,1844,4.15819209039548
1557445,3,B00005JMXX,"Let's face it, no one who viewed this movie at the theatre went in expecting epic storytelling.  Still, I was a little disappointed with the storyline.  It seems we humans (or at least the American segment of humanity) have been bad little boys and girls, resulting in a calamitous change to Earth's weather patterns.

Folks, first of all, the science is bogus--not just the freakish, rapid-paced onset of a new ice age but also of the notion that exposing people to temperatures of -150 degrees will freeze them in their tracks.  Simply ridiculous...and any first-year physics student would agree.

My three stars (a borderline three stars) is for the admittedly impressive special effects.  Unfortunately, there isn't much more to the movie than that.  The story is very simple:  weather changes and people try to get to where it is warmer (by heading south).  The acting is passable, but nothing to write home about.

One thing that did irk me were the political overtones to the movie.  You had a U.S. Vice President character, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Dick Cheney, spouting off his ""anti-environment"" message.  Then you have the wise and innocent Latin American nations stating their willingness to take in the American refugees...provided we ""evil"" Americans forgave all of their outstanding aid loans.

When will Hollywood learn to put away the political axe it now incessantly grinds?

1557446,3,B00005JMXX,"I am eminently capable of enjoying movies with stupid science and/or stupid characters, but there has to be some sort of redeeming quality.  For example, even the pie plate flying saucer in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" sounds good compared to the idea of thinking yourself into the past in ""Somewhere in Time,"" but that film had Christopher Reeve making the grand romance work.  The problem with ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is that the best part of the movie comes in the first act, and that is not where you want it to be.

The stupid science here is to take the idea of global warming leading to a radical shift in climate that creates a new ice age and instead of it happening over centuries or years reduce in to days and weeks.  No wonder scientists were rending their garments over this film, because even though I never took even biology in high school I know that what is being played fast and loose with in this film goes way beyond hearing explosions in the vacuum of space.  However, the whole point of this stupid science is to allow director Roland Emmerich, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeffrey Nachmanoff, yet another opportunity to destroy New York City, having taken major bites out of the Big Apple in both ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla.""  But Emmerich is more ambitious this time around, having tornadoes play havoc with the landmarks in Los Angeles before putting NYC in a deep freeze.

In the grand cinematic tradition that goes back beyond Watergate to the science fiction films of the 1950s, a brilliant scientist, climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), gets to sound like Cassandra while Vice President Cheney, er Becker (Kenneth Welsh), worries about the fragile economy rather than the fast approaching end of the world as we know it.  Hall gathers data and yells that the sky is falling but nobody really pays attention until giant hall comes raining down from the sky, giant tidal waves flood the Eastern seaboard, and a trio of what would be called hurricanes if they were not situated over the three northern continents instead of tropical waters re-program the planet's climate.

The nice thing about identifying the point in this 2004 summer flick where it crosses the line is that Quaid's character actually draws it on a map of the United States.  A trio of killer storms are going to be raging for days over the northern part of the planet.  The temperature is dropping to below -150 degrees, the point at which fuel freezes, where people freeze to death on the spot.  Hall draws a line across the middle of the country and tells the President (Perry King) to order the evacuation of everybody south of the line to Mexico and forget the rest because basically they are dead already.  At that point the voice of sanity and reason in the film announces he is going to go to New York City to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam, the girl (Emmy Rossum) he likes, the rest of the members of the school smart person squad, and assorted citizens of New York are trapped in the New York Public Library which is flooded by freezing water and contains a copy of the Gutenberg Bible.  Sam is smart enough to figure out how to call his father, who tells him to wait there and he will come to get him.

On the one hand kids should always call their parents when they are going to be late coming home, especially when a natural disaster beyond imagination is responsible for the delay.  But if our heroic scientist wants the President and everybody else to write off every human being living above his line of demarcation (my guess is that Canada and Scandinavia are no longer contenders for Olympic gold in hockey), he should practice what he preaches.  Otherwise, he becomes a stupid character.  Beyond that, while I like the idea that a Ph. D. can stop you and people who travel with you from freezing to death when everybody else is dying in their steps, I am pretty sure we are back to stupid science (I bet the Ph. D. has to be in a scientifically related area, which means rhetorical studies does not count).  I live in a place where it is winter six months of the year (our first snow is expected tomorrow night), so I know the value of dressing warmly.  But there are repeated scenes of people dressed warmly freezing to death in this movie so unless Hall is carrying the One Ring or has some other magic talisman that can temporarily dispel the coming of a new ice age, he and the other stupid characters stupid enough to insist on going with him on his stupid mission and all going to die stupidly (unless, of course, the screenwriters just stupidly ignore their own premises and continue with their story unabated by reason).

Basically ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is a disaster film more in the tradition of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (bad thing happens at the start and people try to survive) versus ""The Towering Inferno"" (bad thing happens at the end and people try to survive).  Part of the problem is that there are several extended scenes of mass destruction early in the film and then things get relatively boring with ice forming and ice breaking being the key developments.  The other part of the problem is that nobody in the film is as interesting as Shelley Winters.  My favorite character in the film ends up being Jeremy (Tom Rooney), who has decided that if he is to die his final act is going to be to save one very special book from being burned in the effort to stay warm.  Nothing else in the film has the intelligence or the nobility of that moment.",1097712000,5,5513,4.588594704684318
1557447,3,B00005JMXX,"There was a 1983 made-for-tv film called THE DAY AFTER about the nuclear holocaust. The ""creative team"" behind this current film decided to tack on '...TOMORROW' at the end. Thus, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is the name of the film almost in the same ballpark of humans on the verge of being destroyed by a disaster. The 1983 film, to reiterate, was about a pre and post nuclear attack brought on by other humans.  THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is about the onset of a new ice age out to destroy mankind which is a natural disaster. Nothing new here except that digital special effects can do anything in spectacular fashion. Therefore it allows the viewer to suspend disbelief and see if the characters of the film and the whole human race in general can survive this catastrophe.  This is a rehash of ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE CORE,DEEP IMPACT, EARTHQUAKE with a slight new twist. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a pure popcorn summer action disaster movie. However, it is not very memorable story wise or character wise and the film will probably leave the viewer feeling empty and cold (no pun intended!).

Personally, the only peeve I have with this DVD is the director's track, which, any film buff enjoys listening to as you learn how people make movies. Well, this was the worst director's track I have ever tried to listen to since the advent of DVD. Rolan, the director, writer, and producer, shared producing credit with Mark Gordon. If Mark Gordon would have kept quiet and allowed Roland to speak on his film, it would have been cool, but me thinks Mark is a not-so closeted HAM, and absolutely didn't shut up the entire movie, at-times actually picking on the actors for performances in a contrived manner. Blah. Hope his producing talent outweighs his obvious obnoxious nature. Like I said, just a peeve, has nothing to do with the film. Watch it and love it if you enjoy these types of films, I sure do!

1557449,2,B00005JMXX,"In a nutshell: Excellent musical score, good special effects, so-so acting, horrible sceenplay.  Big budget flick that fails to live up to the hype.

Here's why.  The opening 40 minutes were much like Independence Day; A fast-paced, exciting catastrophy unfolds, this time in the form of super-storms that envelope the northern hemisphere in an ice age.  Lots of good CGI work makes it look impressive on the screen.  It looks like the world's in big trouble again... and then... the story goes to hell in a handbasket, just like Independence Day.  Thankfully, Director Roland Emmerich keeps the Will Smith humor out of this one.  But the story has little substance.  Here's a few of the many flaws I noticed (I left the scientific ones out):

1. Dennis Quaid's character walks(!!!) to New York in search of his son, in the freeze that's supposed to kill everyone who gets caught in it, losing one of his friends in the process.  And, it turns out, his son was just fine because he took his father's advice NOT to go outside.

2. Helicopters flying around tornados?  Just ask a pilot.

3. Scottish research station filled with Englishmen?  Where's William Wallace when we need him?

4. Dizzy-pretty girl tries to rescue a purse that ain't even her's, with a 100ft tsunami coming down the pipe?

5. The freighter sailing down Manhattan... a good laugh, though.

6. You just gotta love that tent Quaid's character stays in.  Looks like a Wal Mart special.

7. Wolves that can scale the side of a freighter?  Unrealistic looking, too.

8. The President simply dies off in the movie.  What happened?  Did a 200ft chunk of ice crush his motorcade or did he slip and fall like Atkins did?

9. Mexico closes off the border!  Muevete!  The Gringos are coming!  We need bigger gates!

10. When it's cold out, you usually can see your breath.  They could have at least added it with CGI.

OK, enough of the criticism.  The best scene; Watching the reporter get wiped out by the billboard!

1557451,2,B00005JMXX,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" is one of those dime-a-dozen films that hardly has an element in it that stands out from the pack. It has no individuality and very little appeal. And yet, for some silly reason, the makers thought they had a justifiable reason to give the public another 'disaster' film.

It seems the producers of this film and countless others, feel that indulging in special effects makes up for shallowness in just about every other aspect of film. The concept of the world rapidly reverting to another ice-age and the catastrophic consequences is an interesting enough idea, yet the film fails. With characters that hardly have any depth, a standard script and a relatively flat storyline, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is strictly a special effects film with very little substance.  The special effects, thankfully are good, but the lack of care the audience has for the characters, and the not entirely believable events that play out, make this a very average film.

1557511,4,B00005JMXX,"Roland Emmerich has this reputation of creating this huge blockbuster disaster films like Independence Day and to a lesser extent Godzilla. Yet we critically forget his 2 finest films: Stargate and the Patriot. It's been 8 years since ID4 and he again destroys the world(and New York for the 3rd time) but it's more spectacular than that despite logic and dialogue.

Jack Hall(why is main characters always Jack for some reason?) is a paleoclimatologist which means he studys the weather that exists 1000's of years ago. He says that melting ice caps will disrupt the climate flow which means we'll enter a new ice age. Of course, no one believes him, including a Dick Cheney look-alike. And he still doesn't believe him afterwards. But soon, Scotland is hit with a hurricane where the eye of it is -150 F and instantly freezes you in about 7 seconds. Hail the size of footballs crash into Tokyo. Tornadoes ravage Los Angeles and a massive tsunami hits New York and then freezes, blanketing the Big Apple in snow.

Come for the effects if you have to. My favorite scene is probably the tsunami hitting New York even though it has an incredibly lame tension builder(super cute Emmy Rossum goes back to a cab when the tsunami is blocks away to get....a bag? Whatever). The LA tornadoes are next where you have those annoying newscasters right in the middle of a disaster reporting when they should get out of here getting nailed by LA's favorite billboard, Angeline. Some CG isn't that great: the wolves don't look realistic and for some reason the New York tsunami wave looks a bit too dark while Deep Impact's wave(also hitting New York) was in broad daylight.

Don't come here expecting to get research for a paper. The chances of it happening that fast is really stretching it and don't ask me to explain the science of certain things like the idea of the super-freezing hurricane. Like the Core, it's awesome and cool to behold but your brain should be off as to not end up spending the entire movie figuring out the science of it.

It was about a really big storm that puts the entire northern hemisphere into a iceage and a scientists son is stuck in it and the scientist guy goes to get him. The only bad part is that some parts in the begining are boring but the rest is really good. If you like movies about storms and stuff watch this movie.,1097625600,,355,4.085714285714285
1557513,4,B00005JMXX,"Okay. First the complaints.

There were some totally obvious computer graphics shots thrown in, like the one where the wolf lunges at the bars of the cage in the zoo or whatever. That stunk.

Also, some of the scenes kind of predictable. Like in the beginning set, in Alaska or Antarctica or wherever, and the shelf begins to break, the main character has to of course jump across the already large gap, make it, grab some beloved test tube thingies, and jump back just in the nick of time. That was incredibly stupid of him.

One last minor complaint I have is the cover of the movie. It looks like a cover for a low-budget film. Don't go by that.

Okay, that's all the complaining I have for now.

Now the good points. One thing that exceeded my expectations was how they thoroughly explained why the world was supposedly heading into a new ice age. That was very cool. It proved that whoever wrote the original book/script knew what they were writing about. Very believable. I don't want to stray off topic but another movie with that cool aspect is Alien Vs. Predator ;)

I also liked those dramatic shots of the tsunami waves hitting the Statue of Liberty. They were awesome. Actually, I liked the whole part with the tidal waves rolling into New York City, though the couple of shots with the Statue of Liberty were still better. ...And I thought the waves at Jones Beach were huge O_o....

I also liked how the movie wasn't totally intense. I mean, it wasn't what you would call 'light', but it still allowed some people to crack a couple of jokes. I don't know about you, but I can't watch a movie that doesn't pause to take a break with the non-stop action.

There are more good points to the movie; but those are just a couple for you to ponder. My advice is that you watch this movie. It really is great. It exceeded my expectations, and it should do the same for you.",1097625600,,1879,4.426086956521739

Yawn.

And how many movies display the Statue of Liberty broken down, frozen up, flooded, or damaged in some way? Another yawn.

One entertaining facet of the plot, thought, is the prediction model the main character, Dennis Quaid, uses to predict the catastrophe. As well, the special effects are high quality and the acting is solid.

As everyone should know, what made this movie great was the special effects. Some great on the tornados and on the wave. I also liked looking at New York City turned into a big block of ice.

Since that's pretty much what makes this movie entertaining, I'll get to my favorite scenes, shots, angles, whatever you want to call them. Most of them are total CG shots of course, but I like CG.

1.)The shot where the water begins rising and the angle does a little 90 degree rotation around the statue of liberty.
2.)The shot where they go to the live footage of the helicopter flying into L.A. while all the tornadoes are destroying the city.
3.)The part where the helicopters fly into the eye, and they do a shot from aove the storm, where the audience can see the helicopters inside.
4.)Of course, the shot where the tornado destroys the Hollywood sign.
5.)(second favorite shot) The shot where the news guy is trying to give a live report about the tornadoes, but a huge sign falls on him.
6.)All the shots of the frozen New York City.
7.)(favorite shot) The shot where the audience sees a ship stuck in the ice, but then the anlge shifts and the audience sees the statue of liberty sticking out of the ice and snow, all frozen.

Some great shots. Definately did a good job with the CG.

I think this is a very entertaining film, and has some of the most impressive special effects as well as shots, angles, whatever, I have seen in any movie. (Except for ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" those were some really good shots)

The movie could have easily been written by pulling formula pieces out of a hat and I wouldn't be surprised if that is how it was written.

1557518,5,B00005JMXX,"This movie begins where it ends. It is a poem in a form understood by so many, yet so few choose to listen. This is the foundation for which, I have seen, this movie, form and build into an epic scale of colossal music. I can understand why people would not like this. A compassionate premise for a movie is not an entirely good movie you would want to make. Yet I believe this is a classic, timeless, in its beginning, and ending, and beyond even truth.

The constant merging of reality and unreality is called Imagination, which is the only purpose of visual effects, and this, the director and actors have proven true.

That is why it is beyond truth, in my opinion. Yet the utter lack of clarity as to what global warming is can be yelled at for years; even hundreds of years, as scientists predict chaos from global warming may ensue; yet the constant struggle between trying to define truth and what is clear about global warming is something that no film can declare absolutely. Having said this, I believe the only purpose of the film is to be epic, compassionate, wonderful.

It is a mystery to me why people overlook this. Perhaps it's the reason why we fail to notice, for instance, the floods are unnatural in our times; too many floods happen and have occurred too recently and too close for us to justify as natural; real people have died in these floods.

Another thing: Hurricanes increase in frequency when we use fossil fuels. They have now for the past thirty years, since the rapid expansion of fossil fuel usage around the world. I think of the people who have died in hurricanes, lost their homes, memories, had their basements and upper levels even, flooded. I think of those I read in the newspaper, and think, we don't need a full catastrophe like an Ice Age to prove that global warming should be acted on now. And if the science isn't exact, why should we avoid the truth that the absolutes determine our fate? If we use thesis and antithesis as reminders of our value; so does the time of change, which is our will, need to understand these two concepts must be battled out within the emotional sphere.

A movie's only purpose is to be emotional. The people watching this hate the nonscience, the unrational, almost boring nature of seeing no facts with which to debate over. I like the candid use, however, of laughter, as it heightens the evil within the film without making you think of science.

You would find these people identically wandering over their pleasure centres with no regard for time, as you would find them criticizing the movie's premise. It is sad to think that less people will watch this film because of a few candid remarks. I hold no belief against those who choose not to however; but I urge those who are struggling to understand that it is not science that compels this future, but human beings, and to do otherwise is to place machines ahead of humanity.",1097625600,3,2911,4.567049808429119

This movie is pure liberal propaganda.  Disgust you to see it.  In the beginning of the movie there is much drama about the US not signing onto the Kyoto agreement, and how this is basically the cause of the havoc that the movie is all about.  Then we are treated to the main human interest characters:  a scientist couple who are divorced (natch) and have a somewhat hostile relationship but who are bonded by their common interest in the welfare of their only child - an unmasculine teenage boy who is afraid of flying in airplanes and who grips the hand of a teenage girl companion for comfort during a bumpy flight.  Real he-man stuff.  It seems to me typically liberal that the scientist couple only had the one child.  Why strain yourself, am I right? And the girl he's got the hots for seems strangely moribund, like she doesn't get enough fresh air or something.  In the scene on the plane, the boy is trying to combat his fear of flying by gobbling candy.  Typical liberal behavior.  Moving right along, once the ice-age storm really gets going, and threatens to engulf North America, there is footage of Americans in droves trying to cross the border into Mexico.  Much reporting on the irony of this ""flood of illegal immigration INTO Mexico""  The Mexican government is sealing the border until the US President cuts a deal whereby the Mexican border is opened to desperate gringos (""Ju e-like me ahora, eh gringo?!?"") in exchange for - get this - the US forgiving latin American debt.

The Day After Tomorrow was a real surprise. Yes, it has amazing special effects, but the film does not rely on dazzling effects as entertainment alone. It has a story that involves a few very developed characters. It has atmosphere, authenticity and a great story. Add to that, expert and sensitive foley, sound, and a gorgeous fully-orchestrated symphonic score and you have a huge epic that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Everything has a cause and effect.  I am not an environmentalist by far, but you have to appreciate Emmerich's approach in what he is trying to say in the film.  Bill Paxton gives a great performance too.  All in all, this is a mighty good flick!

The visuals are good but not oscar worthy, i mean come on what was with those wolves, the hyenas from exorcist the beginning looked realer (and that was a much better overall film too, much better), and all those shots of NY covered in snow and ice looked hand drawn almost, the tidal wave looked the best out of them all, the tornadoes were alright but you only see them for 2 mins.  Overall the film is decent, decent performances (not good) decent, no intense situation of peril (all the disaster stuff takes up like 10 mins of the movie all together, not impressive), the visuals are pretty good, there is too dramatic of a score for the movie because there is no drama, we need more background info on the characters, ID4 and Godzilla are better, Rolands best film is the patriot, its pretty good.

The day after tomorrow is about the concept of ""what if global warming happened tomorrow and ruined the whole world in a few days"". Coneceptually this is not genious, but could have made for a pretty good disaster movie. I for one was very excited when I heard that this was coming from the same guy who did ""Independence Day"". Plus the trailer looked cool as all hell and there was a lot of hype going around about this movie. I went to the theater wanting to like what I saw.

The problem was that what I saw was beyond a mere disapointment and bordered on robbery. I cannot tell you how badly I wanted back my 8 dollars after the credits began to roll.

For starters the acting is just pathetic. As is most of the storyline, characters, and diologue. Now let me tell you - I had no disillusions either. You only expect so much from a movie of this sort in the way of acting and diologue and such - which is how I managed to enjoy independence day, I liked it for what it was. But ""The Day After Tomorrow"" Lowers the bar so much further that it is bad in these areas even when compared to other pictures in it's own genre! The best part of the movie was the special effects and the action - which is sad as you will soon find out.

This is one of those cases where the trailer is actually better than the whole movie. The special effects are very impressive at points, but short lived. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the cool parts of the movie. Everything good about it could be condensed into that 3 minute preview - so save yourself the trouble.

The rest of the special effects are lame, I didn't goto the theater to see CGI wolves that go crazy and they never explain why!. And the super cold air that freezes things on contact os just stupid... original, but stupid. The action sequences are poorly put together - especially since you absolutely don't care about any single one of the charaters (by the way the 'love story' component of the movie is just pitifully portrayed). At times you may actually be wanting them to die so the movie will end.

This not to mention the entire film continually shoves an environmental moral down your throat. The sad thing is the movie would score better as a political message against the dangers of messing up the planet than it does as a special effect disaster flick.

Second, the US Administration went from cool in ID4 to untrustworthy in Godzilla, to incompetent in Day After Tomorrow.

Yes the whole damn movie is contrived of silly notions of global mad science b-movie fluff but the pacing is tight unlike the directors past works which meandered  on and on Day incorporates all the same elements without ever taking you out of the movie.
I also like the message:
No matter how bad you may think you have it its not the end of the world so why wait for something really devasting to happen to make ammends in your life.
As simplistic as the message may be take a look around at the decline of the human spirit in our society then look at yourself a little more closely.
As backwards as this may seem coming from Hollywood who spend billions on movies at least someone within the machine is trying to get a valid point across.
Spider-Man 2 as well had a simular message of its own and even UnderWorld.
Is this a new era of the popcorn flick?!
A self aware and socially respectable Hollywood?!
One of the first major landmark victims in Day was a GIANT tornado erasing the HollyWood sighn.
Clever satire from such a dumbed down ""evil empire""
Maybe its just a fluke!!!!
Either way despite what a lot of people told me to do when I saw The Day After Tomorrow don't shut your brain off while watching it there are(albeit very few)some satrical moments that are pure gold.

That everything is just perfectly fine and there's no pollution and the oil will flow for eternity.  The planet is ours, right?  Without us the planet wouldn't exist, RIGHT?  We can do whatever we want, RIGHT?

In this movie, The Day After Tomorrow, an ice age is triggered by global warming.  Although I don't think that global warming (by our hands) will ever cause such an event, I DO believe that ice ages occur extrememly quickly can desimate entire regions in a matter of a few days.  I believe it's happened in the distant paast and it will happen in the future.  But I think it's cyclical and is due to the planet's obliquity and it's relation to precession.

And when it was all said and done, the first thought that entered my mind upon exiting the theater was, ""I cannot WAIT to get my hands on the DVD!""

For some reason, people have been giving this movie a hard time.  The acting wasn't up to par, the special effects were blah, and all the film accomplished was to churn out ""environmentalist BS"" propaganda.

Oookaaayyy.  I'm not sure which movie you were watching.

I loved this movie.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  And, like I said earlier, I have been waiting for the DVD release for months.

When I pluck down my hard-earned cash to take in a feature, I really don't give a darn about deep, moving storylines; nor do the special effects rate high on my scale; and don't even get me started on that so-called ""environmentalist BS"" mumbo-jumbo hogwash.  Whatever.

I go to movies to be entertained, plain and simple.  And ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was, for me, one exhilarating roller-coaster of a ride.

Lookings for thrills and chills?  You CANNOT go wrong with this movie.  But if you're afraid of being taken over by all that ""environmentalist BS"" this movie is supposedly spewing, perhaps you'd be better off taking in another Care Bears feature.

1557782,2,B00005JMXX,"I saw the preveiw for this movie, and was hyped up. I watched and read reviews, saw TV spots, and got so excited about it, not only for the awesome looking special effects and great concept, but the shrewd political commentary, including the casting of an ignorant vice president that bore a striking resemblance to Dick Cheney, and a young-looking clueless president who was introduced wearing a golf jacket, saying, ""Uh, what do you think we should do?""

The movie had a great set-up, and introduced the characters well, and I was thinking to myself throughout the first half-hour, ""I am so buying this on DVD"". After 30 minutes, the movie slowed down, and began to become more and more absurdly written with obvious, by-the-book plot twists and changes and horribly chlichd cliff-hangers.

Somewhere into the second hour, I had been lost completely wondering how could they have taken this great idea, great cast, huge chunk of money, and army CGI Special Effects artists and made this movie so incredibly bad?

It's set sometime in this decade, give or take a year, in a world where the climate is being effeced hyper-rapidly by global warming, in a reverse effect where global warming triggers an ice-age, by the melting of the ice caps and rising of ocean levels, air currents that flow warm and cold air are scewed, virtually freezing the Northern Hemisphere in a sheet of ice. A climatologist (the name has eluded me) is aware of what's going on, but doesn't no when or how such cataclysmic events will take hold. His son, who is head over heals for a friend of his (her name hasn't remainded in my head either) and joins his school's national academic team because she does. They fly to New York City to compete against various schools in a competition, and unfortunately, get caught in a massive title wave and flood of Manhattan do to rising sea levels. The giant lake that was once Manhattan island freezes over, trapping all residents of the island that couldn't escape. This includes the girl, the boy, and their nerdy friend, who is president of the math, chess and science club. They and a few dozen people get stuck in the Manhattan Public Library, and sends the father and two of his colleages on a rescue mission to save them.

Ok, great. We have the idea, we have the special effects. But we don't have a movie. As I mentioned earlier, the setup is great, but beyond the first 30 minutes of the movie you get increasingly bored. Instead of turning the survival in the public library in freezing conditions with no heat or water into a Donner-Party type battle for survival, they turn it into more of a happy camping trip with no real problems, just the occasional referance to discomfort. The girl cuts her leg early into the movie, but you know that there will be a problem later on, and suspense is killed once again. And even when she does cut her leg, you know she's far to hot to be one of the dead characters, and even if she became one, you wouldn't care because of poorly drawn characters.

The jouurney of the father is boring as well, because no excitement goes on. They don't encounter any trouble, except for when of the father's colleages sacrifices himself to save the other two, but his death has no relevance to the story, and he has no background or developement whatsoever.

All in all, this is a very watchable movie with good laughs, including anticdotes of Americans crossing illegally into Mexico after the country seals it's boarders and various subplots and supporting characters including a bum and his dog--to of the stranded people in the library.

This could have been great had they made the journey of the father a strenuous, pain-staking journey, and the library situation into a Donner Party of sorts, and truly developed the characters. But sadly, they didn't, and that's why they got a sad two-stars from me, and I wouldn't have been so generous had their been no cool special effects.

1557784,4,B00005JMXX,"A while back some well intentioned film critic wrote about ""The Day After Tomorrow"" that it was a clear case of a good film mired by bad science. I disagree. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is nothing like a `good' film.  You would think that after September 11th America's sick cinematic fascination with its own pulverization would have cooled down. Think again.  Or don't think at all. That certainly works for director, Roland Emmerich and his new apocalyptic claptrap, ""The Day After Tomorrow."" I am still trying to glean the Freudian logic behind his twisted fetish for destroying New York City. If you recall, Emmerich also relished New York's decimation in ""Independence Day"" with aliens standing in for Mother Nature.

""The Day After Tomorrow"" is a weak `star vehicle' for Dennis Quaid who makes the least of his role as Jack Hall, a climatologist that nobody believes.  Sela Ward is his estranged wife who, true to Hollywood clich, melts like an ice cap after `hero' husband rescues their resourceful son. Just once I'd like some sane movie executive or screenwriter to explain to me why every couple in a disaster film embark as spiteful enemies but finish out the final reel like a twittering pair of reconciled love bunnies.  Presumably there's nothing like a billion tons of snow to bring two stubborn and evasive soul mates together. At last, something colder than their temperaments.

There's an absence of `good' sense in the way Emmerich allows all of his plot threads to ball up into minor and bothersome sequences of melodrama that play second fiddle to the special effects. For example, when self-sacrificing Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) gets blood poisoning from a leg wound she sustained while trying to save a South African mother and child from the raging flood waters (gee, why couldn't Emmerich have had the directorial huts-bah to go all out and make them quadriplegics too if he was going for the sympathy vote?) and is held up with a fever and chills in the New York Public Library, her impish but studly would-be boyfriend, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) treks out to the Russian freighter in search of the penicillin that will save her life. But the administering of the drug is not the central issue of the sequence, so much as it serves as the spring board for a drawn out chase in which Sam and his loyal friends are almost mauled by a pack of ravenous wolves - eat your heart out, Farley Mowat!  All this schlock and `no - sense' would make perfect `movie' sense if Emmerich's intentions of creating a `message' picture were not staked out in two feeble tack-on's: (1) that man is killing himself through his own stupidity and, for lack of a better explanation, needs to get in touch with his feminine side and become a kinder, gentler animal on and to this planet, and (2) that fossil fuels are bad. Well, duh!

If you're still interested in owning this film, Fox DVD delivers a pretty impressive looking image and sound quality. The anamorphically enhanced picture is beautifully rendered, with deep stylized colors, rich hues and rich, solid blacks. Contrast levels are just low enough to mask the rather obvious digital effects that, at least in the theater, looked very ""cut and paste"" and cartoon-like. Edge enhancement is present but does not distract. The audio has an incredible kick in the base and a very natural sounding spread. Extras include two audio commentaries (neither particularly engaging), a sound demo and DVD-Rom junkets that, frankly, are a waste of your time.",1096502400,,3504,4.857621440536013

Of course the premise is nonsense and has as muich to do about real science and contributing to the global warming debate as ""Godzilla"" contributed to the nuclear proliferarion debate or ""Independance Day"" had with SETI, and ""Stargate"" with Egyptian archealogy.

The writers and directors took a news item and turned it into a big disaster epic. Advice to believers of global warming: don't rely on this movie to bolster your case, it ridicules it more than it supports it. Not intentionally of course.

I enjoyed it, yeah the science was nonsense and after the initial wave of destruction it sort of turned into a big soap opera, but overall I did enjoy it. Special effects were phenominal, acting was acceptable as was the sound and editing and ther technical aspects of the film making part.

The acting is reasonably good for the genre, the suspense builds up appropriately, there are a few surprises in the plot and the political figures are pretty close to reality.  Deep Impact had science that was more believable, had better character development and more ominous foreshadowing.  Independance Day had science that was far sillier, unbelievable characters and a very predictable plot line, though it was fun and meant to be an action/comedy.
I wonder about Mr Shannon's credentials as he dismisses the science behind the Day After Tomorrow disaster.  As the father in the movie said, it is highly unlikely for an ice age to descend upon the world as fast it did in this movie, but how many has humanity witnessed?

Suddenly the script shifted gears. We had leftist political statements pounding us in the face before we could move! Americans crossing the Mexican border was a good example. I guess I might add, I'm not American (I'm Australian. Apparently our country did well in the climate shift) but I felt that the scriptwriter was only interested in engaging in political point scoring. More power to him, I suppose, but this bugged me.

This time, it's Big Momma Nature.  I caught this one in the cinema, and I'm sure that it has a better payoff there than on the TV.  It's still worth a look though.

The premise of the story is a little wild, but all in all this is just another disaster flick.  There's no moral to this story(unless you're a tree-hugger who took this film to be a warning on mankind's affect on the environment).  Nope, nothing here but lots of things freezing up, Americans crossing over into Mexico, twisters in La-La land, and a really quick trip from Philly to NYC.  But everything looks pretty cool while all of this is happening.

The film, if taken as nothing more than a reason to show off some neat special effects, is pretty good.  It does drag along somewhat, but let's face it, freezing things isn't as cool as watching them blow up.  The tornado scenes were some of the best bits of this flick, though they make a rather quick exit.  I also enjoyed the scenes involving the wolfpack(though they looked pretty fake).  The acting is standard and there's nothing really ""great"" about this picture.  But, as stated before, this flick is all about spectacle and light on story.  Nothing wrong with that, right?

On the other hand, if you do consider this an environmental warning, WAKE UP!  This is nothing more than popcorn fun, and it suffices.

You have to step back and ask: Do I care enough about these characters to worry whether they make it or not? I felt so.

It's a film that was decidedly rushed into theaters (REALLY shows in some of the special effects that fall flat), relied more on special effects than story, and really wastes talent of otherwise good actors.

First of all, let me tell you...if you thought Titanic was good when it was in theaters...then rented it and scratched your head going 'Wha?'...I can almost guarantee the same effect with 'DAT'.  It relies so much on special effects that, once that 'wow' is taken out (which the smaller screens inevitably do to heavily Special-effects flicks), you are left with story.  If that falls flat (and BOY does this one!), you have a DVD that will collect dust because you will never watch it, until you can resell it at a heavily discounted price than from what you bought it!

In a nutshell...here's the story:  Global warming has wreaked havoc, and an ice age decends on the northern hemisphere...oh..in about 3 days!  What normally took decades/centuries to happen...the script writers would have us believe happens in a few short days.  Giant hail, inexplicable snowstorms in India, tornados in LA (One of the really cool effects...which lasts about a minute)...everything is going haywire, meteorogically, and we have our empassioned scientist, played by Dennis Quaid, who warned this would happen.  Oh...and for some reason, he decides to don snowshoes and walk to save his son who is stranded in NY:  He's in Philadelphia!!!  This walk presumably takes place over a few hour period.

I would almoust be inclinde to give them a good review because it was very amusing to whach. The digitule efects were amazingly good but the plot was not the best and it was soooooooooooo cheasy!! One scen my friend looks over at me and says a line then the guy says it I mean come on.

1557966,4,B00005JMXX,"The Day After Tomorrow is, in my opinion, a very well-made movie.  The effects are excellent, especially the storm scenes in Los Angeles and the quick-freeze scenes spread throughout the last half.

But, in all seriousness, the plot is as close to impossible as can be.  The idea that Global Warming alone could cause an ice age is nearly laughable.  I know, I know, it's only a movie, but it still gets people to believe that Global Warming is actually the most dangerous thing to happen since the Manson Family, when in truth it's simply a natural phase in the Earth's environmental cycle.

A gradual increase in the Earth's temperature -- regardless how long it lasts -- will not cause an ice age.  Surprisingly enough, ice age conditions can ONLY be created through intense HEAT, which evaporates a good portion of the oceans and lakes, and saturates the atmosphere with moisture (such as like what would happen should a large comet or asteroid strike the planet).  Then the sudden cessation of that heat causes a rapid cooling-off period, which would, in effect, flash-freeze the northern and southern regions of the Earth (again, such as the results should a global debris envelope form following a comet/asteroid collision).  I am a firm believer that the majority of scientists have their ice age theories completely wrong.

Anyway, enough of my 'soap-box' sermonizing.  This is a very good movie, as long as you don't take the plot too seriously, as a few reviewers have done...",1094169600,,1487,4.888446215139442
1557967,4,B00005JMXX,"The movie in and of itself is awsome! I enjoyed 99% of the time it's 25fps were flashed on the big screen, but there were some really really corny parts that you KNOW were inserted either by stupidity or corporate execs who said ""IT HAS TO BE IN THERE!!"".

Like the wolves. Stupidest thing ever. I hate it because it's only there to fulfill some sort of ""profile"" or moviegoer pollsters found after being paid $400,000 to survey 100 people and extrapolate those findings over 300 million Americans. It's just too obvious.

And what the heck is the President doing at the White House during a blizzard that people KNOW is going to go bad?

The British weather station is also weird. First the head dude says ""We have enough to go on for years!"" and then they run out of oil 5 hours later? Right.

BUT I loved the special effects, which are really good and almost flawless. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the VP's reactions before and after do mirror our current VP. And the acting is pretty good most of the times.

All in all it's a very good movie- watch it before you buy it though!

1557968,4,B00005JMXX,"When you go to see a disaster movie, you don't really go to have a deep and insightful storyline. You go to see things get wrecked in a vague read-about-this-in-a-science-book sort of plausible storyline where things basically just get trashed...And this does it. On a HUGE scale.

Dennis Quaid's made some good movies over the years. Nothing that boggle the mind, but they're pleasant to watch. This, though, was much better than any of that. This was just delightful.

My only complaint were those CGI wolves. Seriously. That was really dorky. I mean come on, you're either falling into the ""Twister"" camp of movies or the ""Resident Evil"" camp...but don't go for both. They really served no purpose, the CGI work on them was poor and I really thought that it only served to divert from the rest of the storyline.

Most noteworthy of the movie, and I reason I shall not forget it anytime soon was Ian Holmes. He is one of the finest actors in the world, one of the greatest talents we have, and it's in full-bloom here. He plays a quiet scientist, but even with his reserved manner and precise speech you grow to love him through the short while he's on screen. His final words made me grin fondly. Perfect job, Mister Holmes.

All in all, it was a terrific summer flick. A lot of fun, and it made good conversation with my family over dinner later that night. That's gotta count for something. :)",1093910400,2,1398,4.58
1557969,3,B00005JMXX,"THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is exactly the type of movie I expected it to be. There weren't any major surprises, the acting was decent, and the special effects were big. I was kind of disappointed there weren't a few more natural disasters added into the mix, but other than that things were good.

The story revolves around climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who after years of research comes up with a theory about global warming and a possible coming ice age that most other scientists blow off as being too extreme. However, not long after, Jack's theory seems to be coming true as tornadoes rip through L.A. and softball size hail rains down in Tokyo, Japan. Reports come in that the temperatures of the world's oceans are decreasing at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, Jack's son Sam is off to a scholastic competition in New York. A day or so later, New York gets hit with a tidal wave and then it starts to snow. Jack realizes that New York will soon be at the center of a major deep freeze and he sets forth to rescue his son.

The movie play out the way you expect it to play out and other than a few plot holes, is rather enjoyable. As a sidenote, the theory about global warming in the movie seems far-fetched. However, I found it rather fascinating. The film portrays a possible way that tropical climates could become areas of frozen ice and snow in a matter of minutes. In general, modern scientists don't believe it's possible for nature (science) to act so rapidly--after all evolution takes time. That's why the theory in the movie has been thrown off by ""real"" scientists as having little validity and an impossibility. But what seems most unlikely is sometimes the thing that is most plausible--is there a better explanation about frozen woolly mammoths found in arctic areas containing tropical vegetation in their stomachs? Once you set your hands to the plow, there's no turning back.",1093824000,,1902,4.691616766467066
1557970,4,B00005JMXX,"Roland Emmerich, known for his smart disaster movies such as Independence Day, pulls it off again with this great film.  As an aspiring climatologist, I was especially glad to see that behind every minor weather problem there was some truth behind it, not necessarily behind the major climate change however.  The story though is more than just about the weather.  In fact it is really just a good tie-in for a father-son relationship in need of healing, or is that vice versa, plus a few other relationships made along the way.  Either way, the special effects were great, not obviously fake, and the relationships that were formed or deepened, although sped up for movie time, were still powerful and as awing as the storm.  This is not just another epic disaster film, and it should not be treated as one.  I found The Day After Tomorrow to be a great and amusing film, and definitely one to kick off the summer blockbuster season.",1093824000,,934,4.699386503067485

1557975,3,B00005JMXX,"When I saw trailers for the movie, my first reaction was to pass on it.  It looked like every other disaster movie that was made.  When ""The Day After Tomorrow"" came to our ""cheap"" theatre, my partner and I decided to take advantage of $1.50 night and go see this movie.  After all, it would be cheaper than renting the movie.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed ""Day After"".  The plot is predictable, and one of my initial thoughts while watching the moive was ""Hey, they should call this Deep Impact 2: Deep Freeze"", but after a short while, I warmed up to the movie, and I did enjoy myself.  Its good entertainment, well worth at least one viewing, but as far as owning the movie, I'll probably pass on that.  If you're looking for something stellar and groundbreaking and Oscar worthy, don't bother.  If you are looking to be entertained for two hours, then watch it.  But this is an instance where I would caution a ""rent before buying"".",1092960000,5,945,4.4476744186046515
1558026,5,B00005JMXX,"Fantastic! And all the more believeable in spite of some silly science - no way would the events in the movie happen that quickly when(and I MEAN when) global warming does cause major climate changes, this would take decades, surely . . . BUT . . . extreme weather has happened in the UK this week with sudden torrential downpours and flash floods( a rarity here) and gale force winds at the height of summer - but hey, this is a Roland Emmerich movie. Dennis Quaid plays a JAck Hall, a top, misunderstood climatologist who warms of this happening within 100 years. Politicians naturally misunderstand until it's too late. Then the show takes off with some of the best CGI effects you will see, a monster superstorm with massive twisters destroys LA(I did laugh out loud in the theater when the reporter got toasted by that advertising hoarding on camera, sorry, but that was corny!) and the wall of water flooding New York. Jack Hall's son Sam(Jake Gyllenhall) is trapped in NYC on a school field trip, and as global freezing occurs(due to the shift of the ocean currents, this scientific theory was good), he treks through extreme weather conditions to find him. Jack's estranged wife(Sela Ward) is also in NYC, keeping hospital patients alive; this was also a great subplot showing humanity prevailing in times of crisis. As well as all this, the surviving US citizens are evacuated to Mexico in return for the IMF writing off Third World Debt, you see some spectacular cloud formations from the space station scenes and some scientists trapped in freezing conditions in Scotland doing their best to help out until the bitter end. Altogether, a brilliant movie. I know that there are nitpickers out there who don't like director Roland Emmerich - I have to disagree with them - he's made entertaining movies such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, STARGATE and GODZILLA and also THE PATRIOT, but TDAT ranks as his best; and hats off to him for tackling an issue which will affect everyone one day.",1092787200,3,1986,4.793002915451895

2)Sella Ward, and 3) Randy Quaid. Im not sure I spelled their names correctly- but do I care? Absolutely NOT.  All 3 actors are horrible. Theyve got as much depth as actors, as President Bush actually doing a good job running our country. As for the movie itself? The story is as bad as the actors. The only positive thing I can say about the movie are the special effects.  They're great! Very realistic. So if theres any reason to watch this movie, watch it for the special effects.

The taxi scene was the most awful as well as the total freezing sequences. Can it be colder than outer space?

This movie was a total deception. Now who will take global warming seriously?

We didn't need to have this global apocalypse to show the consequences of global warming. Just have a look at the weather channel. It has already begun and it is only the very beginning. So beware it's going to get worse.
