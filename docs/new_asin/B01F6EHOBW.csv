7749050,5,B01F6EHOBW,"I was beginning to think I would never live to see the day that one of my all-time favorite television shows would finally be available on DVD.  Recently we got the goods news that the folks at Shout! Factory had seen fit to release Season One of ""Lou Grant"" in it's entirely.  Now just weeks later comes word that Season Two will be available come August.  Business must be good!

You could always count on superb writing and the cast led by Ed Asner was second to none. The series tackled a whole host of extremely important topics including government corruption, unethical business practices, environmental threats and public health issues to name but a few. Then there are the ethical questions surrounding the journalistic code that Grant & Co. had to consider when deciding what to publish and when. I always found these internal discussions to be very fascinating.

A couple of years ago I purchased all eight seasons of the ""Quincy, M.E"". series released by Shout! Factory. I am pleased to report that I was very satisfied with the quality of this product.  As such, I am ordering my copy of ""Lou Grant: Season Two"" right now and hope that the demand will be sufficient to allow Shout! Factory to release the remaining three seasons over the next year or so.  I look forward with great anticipation to enjoying all of these episodes once again after all these years.  Network television does not get any better than this. Very highly recommended!",1463443200,6,1455,4.746031746031746
7749051,5,B01F6EHOBW,"Well, this is really good news! While the 1st season is still waiting to be officially released shortly, the 2nd season is already available for pre-order -- and that is encouraging. Not only because ""Lou Grant"" really starts to dig deeper in both stories & characterization in the second season, but because it raises hope that every season will eventually be released. If there's any TV series from that time deserving of such treatment, this is it.

Younger viewers might not appreciate just how positive & powerful the idea of the investigative journalist was at that time, following in the wake of Watergate, revelations of wrongdoing by various Government intelligence agencies & corporations, and formerly taboo issues finally being covered with due consideration. It was a time when reporters were public heroes to many, as they tracked down & revealed so many of the dirty secrets The Powers That Be didn't want us to see. And there was plenty to be uncovered, both then & now ... except that these days the media tends to be more of an unquestioning stenographer to those powers, possibly because they're so completely owned by them.

But this isn't primarily a political series, even if it does deal with those topics. Many of the episodes are deeply personal; the ways in which even a single person's life is affected by events is important. And as in real life, happy endings aren't always assured for everyone. Sometimes the most that can be done is to simply tell their stories, to bear witness to what's happened.

This is just a preliminary review, based on having seen the series when it first aired, and then in reruns. When my pre-ordered set arrives in the mail, I'll amend this review with specifics about visual & sound quality, and particularly good episodes, often featuring future stars in some of their earliest roles. For now, I can only say that releasing ""Lou Grant"" on DVD is long overdue -- most highly recommended!",1463270400,11,1947,4.858433734939759

The picture is not very clear.",1486684800,,98,4.2105263157894735

8760269,2,B01F6EHOBW,The video and audio of these dvd's is terrible...at times inaudible.  Too bad as this was a great season for this show.,1529971200,,119,4.409090909090909
8760270,5,B01F6EHOBW,Very interesting and enjoyable,1529366400,,30,6.75
8760271,3,B01F6EHOBW,"Some episodes looks like a VHS ...and sometimes my VHS look better. Sometimes the imagen is so White It looks like bleached.
The Big problem here is that SHOUT didn't Contact European distributors for a better copy. Here in Europe we use PAL instead Of NTSC which means more definition in image. The show was such a great success un Europe so I guess you can find better image copies in the vaults Of Spanish, British or German TV stations or even a copyright of the original masters. But I assume that SHOUT didn't want to spend Money or time in It. Remember McCloud first 6 full episodes season which was discovered in some forgotten Australian vaults and It was released only there. I am Happy yo have the whole collection but i Will keep an eye for a future European release Of 5th season just in case",1528070400,2,805,4.445945945945946
8760272,5,B01F6EHOBW,"Now that was a great show. I grew up with it. I still love all of the plots, acting, and the morals of the characters!",1527897600,,118,3.76
8760273,5,B01F6EHOBW,"Lou Grant was one of the great TV series of all time.  Each of the seasons has disclaimers that the quality may be less than superior because they had to use multiple sources but they are all more than acceptable.  The story in each case is the thing.  The writing is excellent, the people get under your skin.  The sad thing is that the problems that they write about are not all resolved despite the decades passing.

Highly recommend this.  Good for binge watching or for thoughtful watching when you can't stand another shallow story.  These are anything but shallow.",1522454400,,571,4.65
8760274,5,B01F6EHOBW,"I must say first of all the five stars are for the writing and acting of Lou Grant The final season and not for the sound or picture quality.
Before the start of each episode a message comes up saying In order to being you Lou Grant season 5 ... it looks like for some reason access wasn't given to the master tapes of Lou Grant for the final season and we have a succession of put together video episodes,there is a. Instant sound on a few episodes like a washing machine emptying it is such a shame this great tv show derserves so much better as we the buying public do too!",1522281600,3,576,4.106194690265487
8760275,1,B01F6EHOBW,"""Releasing 02 27 2018""  -  So they say again.
The one star is not for Lou Grant, it's for Shout Factory & their non-answer",1519430400,,122,4.041666666666667
8760276,5,B01F6EHOBW,"In order to like a show I must first love the characters. I love these characters, each so unique in their own way. Stories are well written and well acted. I wish the show could have had a few more seasons. Too late now! Thanks to Shout Factory for releasing all 5 seasons. A few episodes are a bit grainy. This is because, I assume, that they could not locate the original masters so they had to use the syndicated film versions. Better that than not having them at all.",1517875200,,472,4.2555555555555555
8760277,5,B01F6EHOBW,"Shout Factory's product description includes the following:  Please note: In order to bring Lou Grant's fifth season to the fans, some episodes had to be reconstructed from several older tape sources. We apologize for any video or audio abnormalities.

I applaud and appreciate Shout Factory for completing the season and making these episodes available.  But who owns the original masters and is responsible for letting them deteriorate to such an extent that reconstruction was necessary?  Shame on them.",1516752000,3,506,5.448717948717949
