7840192,5,6303180353,"This is a very heartwarming Christmas movie that is still relevant today.  With all the talk of bullying, this is a lesson on how a little tree that is constantly pick-on can grow up to be famous.  My kids, including me, just love it.  I jus wish it was on DVD.",1324080000,2,261,4.078431372549019
7840193,5,6303180353,"This was one of my favorite movies when I was little. In this movie Christopher wants nothing more than to be a X-mas tree but at first he's too little but then he becomes too big to fit in someone's house! But he becomes friends with Hootey the Owl then to some other animals: The Beaver, the Rabbit, the Skunk, the Raccoon, the Buck (Male Deer), the Squirrel, the Chimpmunk, the boy and girl Mice, and the male and female Birds who need a home. Christopher who is a sweetheart lets live in him. The animals are so grateful to Christopher that they sing the song ""Christopher We Love You"". Then Christopher gets choped down and Hootey and the other animals race to save Christopher only to find his wish came true! So now Christopher in everybody's tree. This is a great movie but some characters in the movie are just a bunch of jerks. They are: Hootey's dad at the beginnig of the movie who yells at poor Hootey just because he can't read a book properly (how mean), The other Christmas trees who pour scorn on young Christopher hoping to be a christmas tree because he's too little, These 3 badgers at the beginning who tease and throw snowballs at Hootey becasue he can't fly after Hootey falls out from his house, and the Fox and the Weasel who tell Christopher becasue he's too big he will get turned into firewood And because they told Christopher that he's now scared of becoming firewood! and they even have the nerve to set him on fire!!! Luckliy Hootey puts it out. So other than that a great movie for the whole family to watch.",1212969600,2,1541,4.429577464788732
7840194,5,6303180353,"This is one of our favorite Christmas shows.  It's message is more in keeping with the true meaning of Christmas than others we've seen.  I was pleased to see a nativity set under the family's tree, and the idea of giving of ourselves for others is something we adults can appreciate too.  It's really worth showing every year.",1070409600,,327,4.603448275862069
7840195,5,6303180353,"My children and I watched Christopher the Christmas Tree last year on t.v. and we all loved it.  It is such a wonderful story.  My children loved all the animals in it, and I loved the message the story taught them.  I am so happy to see it available on video and I am going to order it for my children right now.",1069113600,,313,3.9365079365079363
7840196,5,6303180353,"What a great show for children. It has charm, music, adorable characters and a meaning. So many shows today are just silly cartoons. This one is worth keeping as a traditional show to watch around Christmas.",1033948800,,207,4.777777777777778
