8324822,3,B0003052WS,This series was not that great. Part 1 was a lot better and the copy that I bought had many defective discs so I was not able to see the whole series. I was so disappointed and felt cheated that the seller did not mention that in their description. But this series had some great points since they went to Spain to film it...,1326153600,,325,4.09375
