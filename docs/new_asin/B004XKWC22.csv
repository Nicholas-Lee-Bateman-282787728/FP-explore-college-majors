8447096,1,B004XKWC22,"I am a lifelong fan of drive-in films and was really looking forward to having these two classics available on one disc. My excitement was immediately crushed when I popped this DVD into my player.

Both films, Cheering Section and King Frat were transferred directly from their earlier video tape releases. Not the master video, either; these films were transferred directly from video tapes that had obviously been played numerous times. You can see tracking issues as the picture jumps and washes out. You can see lines running through the picture every few minutes; a sure sign that the tapes have been played multiple times.

Both films are full frame presentations and some of the credits are cut off at the edge of the picture.

King Frat is almost watchable but looks like a second or third generation dub. If you want to see King Frat, buy the original video tape in Amazon's used section; it will be far superior to this DVD.

Cheering Section's quality is the worst of the two films on this DVD and is truly unwatchable. Its transfer looks like a twentieth generation copy; it has almost no color, the picture is completely out of focus and the sound is so muddy that, in a few parts, the dialog is totally indecipherable. It looks like a really, really bad bootleg.

The shoddy packaging is also a dead give-away that the DVD is of questionable quality. Whoever designed the cover tried to make it appear as if it were printed on faded, aged newspaper, but failed miserably. The cover art for Cheering Section comes from the original print advertisement but King Frat is a sloppy composite of two of the film's stills using PhotoShop, making it look like a grade-school art project.

There is not one drop of integrity in this horrible DVD and not one shred of care went into making it. Until a proper DVD is released, try to find the original VHS releases.

You have been warned.",1353456000,7,1892,4.663663663663663
