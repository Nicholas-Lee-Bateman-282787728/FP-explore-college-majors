7578459,5,B019NU7AZA,"Love British black humour or find something else to watch.  This is blackest, sly, and so very not pc that it is wonderful.  Nicholas Hoult is no longer that cute little boy from the movie with HG.  He's grown a hunky sex body and is picking films to get away from the boy next door (Skins), and into the male leading man category.  Kill Your Friends moves him up that ladder and then some but the film has its flaws.  Stellfox is shallow and ambitious in his role as A & R manager for a troubled British recording company, and he's not about to be penalized for his mistakes in music taste or judgements.  Breaking the fourth wall, audiences are given his motivation and maliciousness in a gleeful narration that bares industry attitudes toward the production of milquetoast musical arrangements geared toward the mindless messes.  Stylish and greedy, Stellfox's moves to advancement are not for the squeamish, but in Hoult's presentation, they are delightful to watch.  Like a lot. Hysterical for the bent in us all.",1462060800,5,1018,4.744318181818182
7578460,3,B019NU7AZA,"Eh. Love Nicholas. Flick was engaging but not spectacular. Worth a watch if you are into the kind of thing though. Think Trainspotting collides with, and oddly derails, American Psycho right into a big pile of coke and old-school X, which then falls into a pool of alcohol to choke and die.",1461456000,,290,4.596153846153846

7578462,4,B019NU7AZA,"Nicholas Hoult of Skins fame plays Steven Stelfox who is a twenty something A and R man for a London based purveyor of awful music.  He is the sort of person the eighties generation of greed produced. He has no soul and is only in it for the money. He knows it is a cut throat business and so decides to take that advice quite literally by doing just that.

Now this is one of those films that has people either raving or seething and I think comparisons to American Psycho have not aided this in gaining the audience it needs. It is a black comedy but the comedy is fairly well rationed out and if you find bad things happening to be about as funny as a sack of dead babies then you will not like this.

The acting is as expected with no stand out performances and no one letting the side down either. James Corden is in it for a while and does his trademark getting his kit off  which is more worn out in terms of mirth than a Primark welcome mat during sale season. Craig Roberts plays an awkward record co gofor and is ok in that too. Hoult is believable and very unlikeable and I think that is the total point. The record industry is full of the sort or folk that you really do not want to be your best buds  even on a multi media social network. It is cut throat but using the vehicle of humour is a very good way to send it up and so I am in between the ravers and the seethers but actually appreciated this film  the good parts outweigh the lesser ones.",1459900800,3,1461,4.073170731707317

Don't worry though, if your not into british films, this one doesn't even feel like one and the setting takes place in America too and I think in Canada too. Everyone place their part real good and the main character tends to break the fourth wall a lot as if he is guiding you in how to make it while playing dirty. Speaking of dirty, its quite frightening to see what people are willing to do for fame, fortune, and success in the industry for entertainment.

7578468,5,B019NU7AZA,"I've worked in the music industry for 17 years now. There a few movies that understand the insane culture. This one pegs it right on. The Boomers can point to Almost Famous as painting a picture of that time. Kill Your Friends shows just how insulting & egotistical the labels were. Then came the mergers, downloads and indie music and they became afraid. A day before watching this Rolling Stone reported that the industry is making money again on downloads, albums & tours.
Kill Your Friends is wonderfully overblown but not a lie to what still happens. As a sidenote pay attention to Amanda Ghost songs & part in the film. She is one of the smartest women from just after that time who went from being marketed as a pop/dance artist to making a career as a songwriter & producer for Oscar films & TV.",1482451200,,803,4.506849315068493

7578481,2,B019NU7AZA,"Definitely not ""This Generation's American Psycho"" as the blurb on the DVD cover misleads you.  This basically a homage to the British music industry in the worst decade of music (the 90's).  We're constantly told through this music label employee that no one knows what their doing, none of them had a clue if music was good or not.  We know what the actual music that ""made it"" in that decade that obviously that was true, what Kill Your Friends tries to do is tell that story with the angle that if you can't beat them, kill them.  Basically Steven Stelfox (Nicholas Hoult) wants to not just keep his job, but also climb the ladder.  He takes delight in sabotaging his superiors and work colleagues, often setting them up to fail.  But when the only  guy in the office who is an even bigger substance abuser and knows less about music history and current artists than he does he loses it and kills the guy.  This is the start of what won't be the last, in a predictable movie where you literally can be stabbed in the back.  What I've just outlined actually sounds a lot more exciting than the movie actually is.  Stelfox is a completely unlikable character. Great killing spree movies have villains that although obviously doing evil things, are still quite likable.  Not this guy.  A lot of the dialogue is mumbled or the characters are out of it due to being wasted or high.

Kill Your Friends is a movie that should have been great, but just wasn't.",1475452800,,1456,4.511450381679389

7578485,4,B019NU7AZA,"For full disclosure I have to say I am probably Nicholas Hoult's biggest fan so take this review with that in mind. Nic plays a record producer type who has to scout for new talent in a very literal cutthroat business. he is all in when it comes to the drugs and the violence. I don't want to say too much about the movie itself but I loved it. Nicholas gives as he always does one hell of a performance. he has the looks and the sophistication to pull this very difficult characterization off.

A couple unanswered questions like why would that police officer believe he's hit it big and signed with a record label when his prime suspect in a murder case has shown multiple hints of suspicion. Just didn't really understand that one, not sure why he thought his only option was to chop up her body, that also seemed a little too hardcore.

Throughout the film we watch as he descends to darker and grittier tactics to advance, all while he plasters a charming face on for his coworkers at the office. Be warned that there is heavy depiction of drug use, but aside from that and the one band that shrieks nothing but profanity. I happily reccomend this film to anyone who is in the need of a distrubed laugh. Hoult plays psycho, and charmer with believable transitions between the states, and his consistent addressing of the audience kept the darker moments light hearted with his banter.

The movie shows the recording industry in a negative light, although I can't recall a film that ever had a positive spin on the industry.

7578506,5,B019NU7AZA,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I believe KILL YOUR FRIENDS might just be the best non-horror film Ive seen so far this year.  And given the number of movies I watch each month, that is truly saying something.  The film is touted as a comedy crime-thriller (according to IMDB.com), and it offers huge doses of all three genres.  Rife with dark humor, insane characters, and a chilling theme, KILL YOUR FRIENDS is a movie youve got to see to believe.

I love every aspect of this film, and Im giving it a five out of five stars.  It is simply THAT good.  When a film flies by, and I never check the clock to see how far into it I am, I judge it as a phenomenal win.  Such is the case here.

KILL YOUR FRIENDS is shot very well and looks amazing onscreen.  The energy given off by the cinematography is magnificent, and it conveys to each scene like an electrical current.  I love the imagery in the film, as it truly highlights the zaniness of the concept and that particular time period.

The acting is top notch, with Nicholas Hoult giving an excellent performance as the main character, Steven.  Hoult is a talented and versatile actor, as showcased in such fan-favorite films like X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, WARM BODIES, and MAD MAX: FURY ROAD.  I greatly enjoy him onscreen, and I hope to see more of him in the future.  He is joined by a great cast that includes James Corden, Jim Piddock, Tom Riley, Georgia King, and Craig Roberts.

The storyline in KILL YOUR FRIENDS is based on a book by the same name, and from what I understand, it mimics actual events from the time period.  Regardless of its origin, the plot is engaging and fun.  It is a dark and twisted look into the mind of a man willing to do anything to get aheadeven though his actions sometimes bring about unexpected consequences.  I love how the film ends, and I have to say it is very fitting.

KILL YOUR FRIENDS is a massive win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  It is crass and rude in parts, so don't watch with the kiddos around.  But be ready for a wild rideits definitely worth it.",1465257600,,2111,4.331632653061225

7578509,2,B019NU7AZA,"""To drive your enemies before you, and here the lamentations of their women"". Wait, isn't that one of the dumb credos of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian? Yes it is, but what the heck is it doing as the driving theme of Owen Harris' wannabe ""American Psycho"" flick, ""Kill Your Friends""? Your guess is as good as mine, but it may have something to do with not really having anything new to say about the music industry in which it's set. Did you know that most record execs only care about making money, not making great music? Mind totally blown, right?

Set during the height of the '90s Britpop wave, the film stars Hoult as ambitious and unethical A&R man Steven Stelfox, whose only goal is to make it to the top by any means necessary. The music biz can be murder and Steven takes that literally, even if it means killing one of his buddies to earn a promotion. There isn't much of a plot to speak of, really, as Steven travels to music festivals and concerts, snorts coke like a demon, and murders anybody who dares get in his way. Meanwhile, Steven has his eyes open for the ""next big thing"" that can sell a s***load of units, whether the band is actually good or not.

Hoult is an endlessly charming actor and that works in his favor always, but especially when he's playing the villain. However his frequent fourth wall-breaking monologues (think ""Deadpool"" only less funny or meaningful) are dull and accomplish nothing but to repeat the film's cynical message. We're expected to see him as the rock music version of Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman but there's nothing about Steven that is remotely interesting, and little revealed about him that is enlightening. The music industry is cutthroat? Got it. Being mean and nasty is all the film has going for it, and ""Kill Your Friends"" keeps skipping back to that like a warped LP.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Your-Friends-Blu-ray/dp/B01DD4K83S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Your Friends [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,12,2024,5.075075075075075

I watched it about 85% through but had to give up and my first thought was that if I didn't know better, I would have thought the trailer and the movie were not the same. The trailer I watched, I swear was a totally different movie.
