2957000,5,B000VWX6SA,First of all Season 5 was AWESOME! As far as Joyces term paper down there... PLEASE! Rubbish is what I say of that. Just go bugger off somewhere! ATHF is and will always be great. so there.,1200441600,4,189,4.135135135135135
2957001,1,B000VWX6SA,"I generally agree with Joyce's opinion, but for a slightly different reason.  I didn't object to the violent content, but to the overall ""mean-spiritedness"" of the episodes in the 5th season.  In addition to that, these episodes didn't have enough of what makes the show great--the banter between the ATHF in their house.  Really they don't seem to have the same sense of humor, as if they were written by another person.  I think you can pick up on this change at the end of the 4th season as well (in particular, the episode focusing entirely on Carl, where the ATHF go on vacation, is just gross and not funny at all....at the time I thought THAT episode was just a fluke.  But after the first two episodes of Season 5 came out, I was ready to give up on the show...).  THEY'VE LOST THEIR WAY.

Joyce said ""And so, if you want some great animation that might actually make you feel BETTER and that there actually IS some magic out there....""
I would recommend the first twenty or so episodes of The Backyardigans, one of my favorite shows until the creators ALSO lost their way in the most recent season (but in a much less offensive way).....",1200268800,9,1146,4.480769230769231
2957002,5,B000VWX6SA,"What Joyce doesn't seem to understand is ATHF is how it's humor is shaped. The whole series is based on character interaction rather than plotlines for humor. Those who are true fans of the series understand that ATHF is made up of half-baked plots and shocking character interaction and of course, Joyce, ruthless violence. This isn't suppose to be a mind simulating program, where the plot and characters are appliable to our lives, such as South Park has become. Dont get me wrong, with the exception of Season 10, I love EVERY South Park season. But ATHF is a completely different show, and draws it's humor from different elements.
That being said, first time watchers might not enjoy this. The stories are far fetched and hard to appreciate without already being in love with these characters. But, in my opinion, this is the best ATHF yet. I didn't like season 4 as much as the first 3, but with such classics as ""Dickesode"",""Handbanana"", ""Boost Mobile"", ""Bart Oates"", and ""Dirtfoot"", season 5 definitely seems to be a comeback for the series. BEST EPISODES:
1. ""Handbanana""-The whole episode is hilarious. It's hard to put it as #1, because there are so many great episodes. But Carl has the funniest one-liners over every other character.
2.""Dickesode""-Call me immature, but no matter how many times it is said, the word ""dick"" never ceases to be funny to me. Plus the little dick collectors are hilarious. ""So...Whos gonna get their dick ripped off tonight?"" haha
3.""Dirtfoot""-Shake falls down a well and meets his soon-to-be-roommate Dirtfoot, little do they know Dirtfoot has a HUGE secret. This one's very funny. Once again, hard to put these in any particular order.
4.""Bart Oates""-As I write these, I realize how heavily Carl was implemented into season 5. The character interaction between Carl and former NFL lineman Bart Oates is hilarious. As they attempt to repent for Carls mistakes, Carl uncovers a mystery about Bart Oates. Note: This is why kids shouldn't play with bb guns.
5.""Boost Mobile""-I can't even explain why this is so funny. Just watch it. ""Where you at, dog?""
Overall, this season will not disappoint for long-time fans, but will probably turn away many first time viewers.",1200268800,7,2208,4.954177897574124
2957003,4,B000VWX6SA,"Joyce, you present an interesting argument, and although ATHF has changed a bit in this latest season, Carl has been repeatedly killed through-out the series (he's been skinned, had his upper body blown off by Ted Nugent, had his arms ripped off an eaten by Willie Nelson (the monster), defenestrated himself and other deaths). Hand Bannana was a bit over the top, but all in all, it wasn't completely unexpected from ATHF. It took a little adjusting, but I kind of like the new ones. I will admit, I haven't seen the one with Frylock having cancer yet(Not really looking forward to that particular episode), but I think even more depressing was the one where Frylock moves out and leaves Meatwad and Shake alone and starving in a house full of rotting chickens.

I will admit, I've known a lot of people who consume without thought, but when a series takes a new direction, it can be a good thing. Besides, South Park had a few seasons where I just kind of lost interest, and then they seemed to get it back. Things like ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" was a bit too far out (blood orgies and the like), but it was still amusing in places. Eventually they seemed to fall back into cool episodes, and I thought their latest DVD release was pretty sweet (As a former PC technician, I got a kick out of the W.O.W. players as they looked rather familiar).

BTW: I loved the Azamanga Diaoh series (I bought the box and have seen them all), but it's a slower kind of humor. In relation to Aqua Teen it's night and day. As far as the decline of values on American TV, when we the shocking becomes boring, we move back towards actual plotlines. I've seen a ton of movies from the 50s because they're a break from the frantic race of special effects and shock values. Give it a few years and come back to this series and you'll probably wonder what the big deal was because something new and more intense will to have made this look tame in comparison...",1199404800,8,1943,4.470422535211267
2957004,5,B000VWX6SA,"or Hand Bannana will rape you!

(i think hand bannana may have been the best new character in the show so far... next to danzig or the billy witch doctor...)",1199318400,16,157,4.233333333333333
2957005,1,B000VWX6SA,"This is a very long review that's been building up in me for a long time and I was hoping this set would never be released. If you've seen these episodes and loved them, just ignore me and place your order. If you, like me, have grown tired of all the negativity, banality, and just plain EVIL-ness of modern American television, then go ahead and read if you want to...

I am writing this as an owner and huge fan of ATHF Vols. 1 thru 4, just so you know that I'm not just slamming a product because I hate the show or simply have nothing better to do.

When Season 5 was almost ready to start on Cartoon Network last year, I was so incredibly psyched that I made my mother think I was a little insane - she saw me standing up cheering at that weird Meatwad promo commercial while freaky music is playing in the background. But now thanks to season 5, I think I just might have BECOME a little insane.

I understand that thanks to years of ultra-violence being overshown in movies and on late-night TV we've all become almost completely desensitized. People getting shot in the face, decapitated, shot in the knees, disembowelled, shot in the groin, run over, shot in the hands, stabbed, pushed off a building, etc. just doesn't freak us out anymore. So directors started being CUTE about it - the ultra-fast hit-by-a-truck scene in Final Destination, is one example. But a lot of people have caught on to even this, especially college-aged kids nowadays who have fond memories of sittng on Daddy's lap while he played Doom on the computer after work.

So now we have shows that must push the envelope beyond anything ever done before... Some, like Metalocalypse, manage to do it in a way that really doesn't bother me - there's real humor there, plus the violence feels more comical than ghastly, the animation is superb, it reminds me of those cool Iron Maiden album covers from the 1970's, etc. I mention this only to emphasize that I'm not some anti-violence zealot out to trash television shows. So long as it's good and there's a real story, I don't mind violence. It's the 'no hope in sight' culture we have going on nowadays that gets to me - violence and shocking situations used just so nobody has to actually write a STORY. I go into this a little more near the end~

Saying that, there's something...OFF...about the new Aqua Teen cartoons. When I saw the episode where Carl wins a free (and mandatory)'Get Your Penis Cut Off' after he and the Force go shopping at a convenience store, I figured it was just a bad-episode fluke since the creators were busy at the time working hard on ""Colon"". The episode really bothered me though, for some reason. I know, it's CARL we're talking about, who's basically Archie Bunker with raging hormones, without the hidden 'softer side', and without anyone who loves him... but still.

Then came the episodes that made me really really sick. And I mean PHYSICALLY nauseous amd temporarily depressed. The first of which was about a big long yellow balloon-like dog that Master Shake creates out back in Carl's pool - though it may as well have risen out of the blood pools of HELL. First off, it just LOOKS evil - and it proves his alignment by threatening Carl over the phone, breaking into his house, and anally raping him in a very brutal scene (even though you only see Handbanana (the ""dog's"" name) through Carl's window from outside). Again, you might say it's CARL that it's happening to - but does that really mean that rape is OK so long as you don't like the person it's happening to?

""Oh lighten up - it's just a cartoon!"" I'm sure a lot of violence-desensitive, die-hard fans are saying that right now. Except it's NOT just a cartoon. Anyone who's seen all the other episodes knows this, otherwise you wouldn't CARE what I say about it. To us fans it's become a universe unto itself in our subconsciousnesses - the characters have become real to us in the back of our minds - why d'ya think all those Trekkies (or Star Wars fanatics) keep going to conventions dressed up as Klingons (or Jedis), and it's also why housewives really believe Kirk is secretly having sex with Jeannie on their soap opera and why millions of Americans NEEDED to see Ross and Rachel get back together on the final episode of Friends. It just HAPPENS when you watch (and love) a TV program for a very long time. So yes, bad things have happened to characters in Aqua Teen Hunger Force before - but never quite like this. It really really bothered me. I'm sure that a lot of you will still disagree with me and loved the 5th season episodes, but like I said before - while I was watching them, it felt like something was kind of off or wrong somehow. Could just be bad direting too, though.

The episode that pre-empted my watching the rest of the series was the one where I had to watch Frylock slowly die of cancer. You can tell they really tried to make it disturbing too, the way the fries begin to wither and rot, and THIS I can say with probably no argument: cancer isn't funny. It never was and never will be. South Park went ahead after this aired and put out ""Stanley's Cup"" which is one of the lowest-rated episodes in the show's history.

I just don't know what the hell they're trying to do or say with ATHF anymore and it feels like every show on Adult Swim is violent and/or sickening in their quest for viewers - farewell, Space Ghost! - but to be fair, like I said in paragraph seven, I stopped watching the episodes after the Frylock death ep so I only saw about half the episodes total. The other episodes were just...there. I don't really remember them so they couldn't have been that bad. They were just overshadowed by the darkness looming from the ones I mentioned. But this set still deserves one star because of the way it basically killed ATHF for me. It'll be a long time before I can watch the other four sets, and I'll never watch another new episode again - ever. I just can't stand what's become of the show.

One last note - I really hope we somehow get back to entertainment without needing to resort to violence to get people to watch - violence is fine if it's PART of the story, just so long as it isn't over-used because there simply IS no story. Carl getting his penis cut off is a good example because that IS the whole story. No creativity is used in that episode whatsoever. Same goes for Frylock having cancer - just wither him away while other characters react - that's it. No story is present in that episode, just the destruction of a character I happen to like. Now, Handbanana may be creative at least, but the violence bothered me so much that I'm pretty sure that this set easily made it into Satan's DVD library.

I used to believe that 'kids these days' were becoming unemotional, uncaring mega-consumers who live minute by minute - demanding to be entertained with quick and shocking bits of video and with as little thinking involved as possible. There's a lot of evidence to support this - and I had neighbors who WERE like this - but I also found out fairly recently that there's also a lot of 'kids these days' who are tired. Tired of being treated like nothing but a consumer of gadgets, tired of being told what music is 'cutting edge' and 'rebellious' by white men in suits sitting around an office all day, and tired of being shown sick GARBAGE like Deal Or No Deal, Boiling Point, My Sweet Sixteen, and season five of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. A lot of them get depressed because, well, I think it's pretty obvious with just what our culture has to offer nowadays, never mind everything else. If THIS is what we're being offered as escapism from day-to-day problems, we're in a lot of trouble.

And so, if you want some great animation that might actually make you feel BETTER and that there actually IS some magic out there, where your dreams don't necessarily have to die like Frylock did in that episode, use your money to get the complete set of Azumanga Daioh and/or the three volumes of a show called Strawberry Marshmallow (it's a poofy name, but an emotionally uplifting show. Both are Japanese and I HIGHLY recommend seeing them that way with the subtitles, but they're also English dubbed, naturally). I have to recommend these shows as strongly as possible in case someone's reading this who feels like I do or understands what I'm trying to say. Watch these and I guarantee you'll get a little more hope back that there IS still magic out there, and that there's emotionally involving stories, characters that come to life (the animated characters feel more real than anyone on Prison Break or Lost or Grey's Anatomy - and I mean that as a fan of two of those three shows!) We used to have magical heartfelt shows in this country - heck, season one of Aqua Teen was one of them! - so hopefully someday the magic will return.",1199145600,48,8830,4.501559575795383
2957006,5,B000VWX6SA,obviously the dvd hasn't come out yet but as a dedicated ATHF fan i have seen all the episodes and this continues to be the weirdest show on television... and my favorite!,1195171200,8,171,4.375
2957007,5,B000VWX6SA,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is probably the greatest t.v. show about anthropomorphic food items ever created. Although this season isn't released yet, obviously, it has already been shown on adult swim. This truly shows off the comical genius of Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro, and it shows off just how many brain cells they've lost from certain chemicals and controlled substances. I would also highly recommend the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters For DVD (ATHFCMFFTFDVD). Now for anyone out there who says that this isn't funny, you all will probably end up feeling the warm hoof of satan embracing your face. Hope this helped.",1193011200,11,646,4.9907407407407405

Amazon should correct this to not confuse people in what episodes are featured on this DVD. I still give this 5/5 because I love Aqua Teen, just beware if you really want season 5.

While this series has worn off a bit from when I was first enthralled by the sheer dada-esque insanity, the best episodes still transcend to amazing levels of bizarre, gross, surreal humor.

How is it not funny that Frylock has cancer, yet in the very same scene, Shake eats a scorpion and is choking on it and dying? Why can choking and people's heads getting blown off be funny, but as soon as it turns into a ""serious"" issue, the fact that death is imminent more serious? If this was the case, people would be sad and outraged when, in season 4, shake took a bottle of sleeping pills, put a hose in his mouth that was attached to the tailpipe of Carl's running car, and jumped in a pool of piranhas. But no, that's pretty damn funny, but Frylock's ""cancer"" is not? I think sometimes people need to relax and just go with the flow. NOTHING is really serious in ATHF and it's been like that from season 1. If you've just noticed it now than you've really been out of it.

2957051,3,B000VWX6SA,"I've seen some reviewers on here who were disturbed by some of the latest episodes on the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume Five DVD collection. While I don't think cancer or rape are funny in real life, you have to remember that this is a CARTOON. It's not real. Having said that, I have to admit that this season wasn't as funny as the last season. The show seems to have lost a lot of the hilarious dialogue that made it so damned funny when it first came out, especially the nonsensical rambling of Shake and Meatwad together. The writing was lack luster, and the episodes seemed to have no plot and ended simply because the time alloted to them on adult swim had run out. The movie, I think, was a return to the comedy that made us fall in love with the show to begin with. However, there are some gems in this box set. For example, Shake's radioactive grill is probably the funniest episode on her after Handbanana. Grim Reaper Gutters isn't bad, and Dickesode was funny, but it could have been better. DirtFoot was a dud, and Antenna was stupid. Ezekiel was funny, though. So was the Super Star Studded Christmas Spectacular. All in all, to hardcore fans, it's worth buying. To the casual viewer who just flips channels late at night, it's not worth your buck. P.S. we all miss Dr. Wierd, and there is no Ogelthorpe and Emory, well, except for when they're exploded by Shake's  ""flavor beam.""",1211587200,,1395,4.4921259842519685

The jokes fell flat and everything was just annoyingly inconsistent.  I'm glad to say the newest episodes have been a marked improvement, and that when Season 6 gets released on DVD, i'll buy that one instead.",1205193600,3,463,4.646341463414634

Volume 5 is for fans of the show only, though the Boost Mobile episode was an instant classic. The show took a bizzarre, edgy and weird-for-the-sake-of-weird turn. It's almost in the tradition of Modernist playwrights like Harold Pinter at times. The episode ""Party All The Time"" is more art than cartoon, and plays with your emotions more than you thought possible from a ""stoner cartoon"". This volume proves ATHF is smart, and loves to push the boundaries of TV and the concept of Cartoons in general.

Die hard fans will not be disappointed, but newbies should start elsewhere to learn the ropes.",1204416000,11,1189,6.56687898089172
2957058,5,B000VWX6SA,"I pretty much thought rape could not be funny no matter what and it's not really. In any way shape or form rape is one of those things that just lacks comical value. And then I watched ""Hand Banana"". I think the people that make it might get high or maybe they did a lot of acid growing up. I don't know how these guys come up with this stuff. The writing is freaking great. The characters are all great. It's a great fuhking show, period. One of the most original and inspired TV shows ever. Don't let anyone deny it. It isn't remotely intended for everybody. Aqua Teen Hinger Force IS art.

Agree that season 5 is particularly for the already converted serious fans, and not the best season to start with. So, if somehow you haven't already been a fan for years now and haven't experienced earlier episodes go back to seasons 1,2,3, & 4.",1204329600,,839,4.343949044585988
2957059,4,B000VWX6SA,"After being delayed by the production of the Aqua Teen movie, we finally get the fifth season of Aqua Teen on DVD. A lot has been written about this season. Some were disappointed with it, some were offended and some feel the series has jumped the proverbial shark. However, I loved this season, and feel it's very underrated.
It's not the best season, I feel that the best season of the show was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aqua-Teen-Hunger-Force-Vol-4/dp/B000B5XOR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 4</a>. Season five takes some risks and most of them pay off, at least for me.

There are two controversial episodes in this set that really have divided fans and their opinions on the show. I think most fans of the show agree that the hand banana episode sank like a stone. I understand what the creators were trying to do, make a very unfunny subject like rape, funny, but it just doesn't work. On the other hand, the other controversial episode were Frylock is dying of cancer was very funny to me. I've had family members and a dear friend die of cancer, but I still thought this episode was funny. It's a surreal and an absurd episode that I think people are making too much about. If you don't think it's funny, read the banner the guys hang in the house welcoming Frylock home from the hospital. Plus, the use of Andrew WK (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Get-Wet/dp/B00005RY7X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Get Wet</a>)  performing a party song is more proof that this episode isn't meant to be taken seriously.
With that said, there are some undeniably great episodes in this season. ""Global Grilling"" is Aqua Teen at their best. Anyone who feels the show has lost a step since season 3 should see this episode, they'll reconsider those feelings. The ""Dickesode"" is much funnier now that it's uncensored. The scene where Meatwad re-enacts a tv commercial with puppets, since they don't have Tivo, is classic! Other great episodes include: ""Dirtfoot"", ""Boost Mobile"", ""Carl Wash"", ""Grim Reaper Gutters"" and ""Ezekiel"". The 2-part ""Star Studded Christmas Spectacular"" is also good, since it contains finished footage cut from the Aqua Teen movie, that is a million time better than anything seen in the movie! The rest of the episodes are pretty decent as well, with the only real duds being ""Hand Banana"" and ""Bart Oates"".

The DVD packaging is a nice digipak, like previous editions and they've included a sheet of Aqua Teen Hunger Force stickers with this set, which I thought was pretty creative. Extras include adult film star Tera Patrick recording her vocals for the ""Grim Reaper Gutters"" episode, deleted scenes (too short), ""Learn to Shred Like the Master"", ""The Worst Game Ever"" (loved it) and more.

Overall, not the greatest season of the series ever, but it's not the disaster some fans would have you believe. The show is still cutting edge, creative and most importantly... funny. With the never ending war and an economy that's going to go from bad to worse long before it gets better... a few laughs are in high demand these days. Pick this one up, and you get more than a few.",1204156800,5,3210,5.096958174904943

2957063,3,B000VWX6SA,"While this season is not my favorite, I'm genuinely surprised at the reactions in some of the 1 star reviews. Guys, we're talking aqua teen here. I'm a fan of some of the ""alternatively"" suggested shows in those reviews, like Azumanga Diaoh, but this is an apples and oranges comparison.

ATHF has always been at its core, like south park, pushing taste and using shock for its humor. Is Carl being raped by Handbanna or Frylocks cancer any less disturbing then Carl having his skin ripped off by trees, or Santa Clause burned and mutilated, and screaming in pain? The tone in this season didn't strike me as any different.

I thought some episodes were very funny (I really enjoyed Dirtfoot, and Grim Reaper Gutters) Some were funny and yet disturbing (Handbanna...and to answer Joyce's question I don't find rape funny,  but this is fiction. And what's happening is absurd. We know next episode, the slate is wiped clean, and what I found funny about it was the absurd and impossible situation, not the rape itself. I don't think people that found this amusing are some kind of evil sadist. I don't find real Murder or Suicide or cruelty funny, and yet ATHF is full of these too, and Joyce admits to being a fan before this. Should I assume J thinks these things are ok in real life because they've enjoyed the show in the past? Of course not.) Some episodes didn't do anything for me (The deleted scenes from the movie episode I found boring.)

I felt this way about the extras too. Some were very amusing (I liked the space Ghost ATHF premier, and the SGCTC with the brain shampoo best.)  The live tapings of grandma's voice session, and Tara whats-her-name, the porn actress, were amusing as well. Some were ok, the responses to the critics, the game trailer, and the deleted scenes, and some I thought were really terrible: The guitar lesson video, and the worst game in the world (although at least it was honest)

Its not the best season, mostly for its uneven feeling, but I don't feel that I wasted my $20 on it.  I just think that trying to analyze it as anything but what the show has always been is reading far too into it. If you believe that rape and murder in fiction leads someone to do these things in real life, then stay away from this show. Not just season 5, but the whole thing. For the rest of us that can separate fiction from reality, it may be a worthy buy if you've enjoyed the rest of the show. I'd suggest viewing first before you buy if you can.",1202860800,,2476,4.476718403547672
2957064,3,B000VWX6SA,"In another of my reviews of this series, I pointed out how old-fashioned the humor of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is.  That is, it is sharp and raw, like the bodily-function humor of Dante or Chaucer (if you think ATHF is not for the faint of heart, stay away from ""The Inferno"" of Dante, or The Canterbury Tales).  It also presents fair specimens of human behavior, and examines them through the prism of our main characters, the Aqua Teens (and to a lesser extent, Carl).

Here, as before, the standard ATHF plot is at work; the Aqua Teens have their daily lives interrupted by a strange, or otherworldy character.  In this season, the strangers range from quasi-celebrities like pro footballer Bart Oates and porn-queen Tera Patrick, to chimeric figures like Hand Banana, mini-shake Ezekiel, or the nefarious Dr. Wongburger.

Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis stick to what they do best, as well; writing great dialogue.  Every line has a purpose -- it either sets up a joke or finishes it.  In especially fertile patches, every line will serve both of these ends, to the point where the writing is so dense with brilliancies that four or five viewings are required to get every joke.  Of particular note in this regard are the episodes ""Ezekiel"" and ""Hand Banana"".  These two, in particular, strike me as the funniest in the entire ATHF catalogue (keeping in mind, of course, classics like ""Mail Order Bride"", ""Carl"" and ""Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Future"").

The show weakens when it relies too heavily on the celebrity appearance; this is the case with the Tera Patrick episode.  It's harder to be funny with this lubricious caricature (voiced by the porn queen herself) spending the entire episode crawling around on all fours.  ATHF's strength comes from the ""closed circuit"" nature of its humor -- unlike ""Family Guy"" (or ""The Simpsons"" or ""South Park"") the allusions to popular culture are usually kept to a minimum, and the show is stronger as a result.",1202688000,,1959,4.84984984984985
2957065,3,B000VWX6SA,"Okay, there are so many comments about how disturbing this is.  And yes, maybe I am desensitized by things like this, but I personally don't care and I don't think I'm all that desensitized.  I didn't find this all that disturbing, anyone who can read de Sade and not be disturbed will find nothing disturbing in this.

Regardless I don't think this was top notch compared to the other volumes.  It's been a while since Volume 4 came out and I was pretty excited to get Volume 5 because I hadn't seen any of it on TV.  After watching this with my friends I seriously think they may have over extended themselves by writing a movie.  The writing on most of these episodes is just bad and it seems they have replaced humor with extremity.  Which can be done in a hilarious fashion, but it lacked writing.  Like Dickesode... that started off strong and ended stupidly.

Volume 5 is really hit or miss with me, because it does have a few great episodes, but it also has some episodes that just aren't funny.  It also has others that just have a single funny moment, like when Carl got a lobotomy in Carlwash and he was licking his car afterwards... hilarious, but the rest was pretty bland.  I really liked Global Grilling though, I thought that episode was pretty smart and absolutely hilarious.  I also liked most of Hand Banana, and the rape part didn't disturb me (again, I've read de Sade)... it's a yellow hand dog... it's not even a real creature.  However, the end of the episode where Carl made his own dog, for some reason it kind of ended for me, it wasn't funny at that part, it just seemed like a forced conclusion.

I'm hoping that the lack of creativity is because they were spending their time writing a good movie and that Volume 6 will get back on track.  It just seems like their creativity was exhausted, and this season was more bland than others.  I will probably pick up a Volume 6, but extremity for extremity's sake is kind of boring after a while, so I hope they focus on the writing in the future.",1202688000,6,2020,4.418918918918919
2957066,4,B000VWX6SA,"I am seeing a lot of comments regarding the cancer episode, ""Party all the Time."" People say it is sick, isn't funny, and is insensitive. First off let me say I have just recently lost a friend of the family to cancer, so I am aware of how serious it is. But since the beginning of time, we have coped with the realities of the world with humor. Ever heard the term ""Oh The Humanity!"" which gets thrown around all the time? Well, people used to get burned alive, and that's what they screamed, and later it became something people would sarcastically say anytime something seemed crappy. Guess what? It doesn't make the suffering of real people any harsher. Joking about cancer doesn't make more people suffer from it, and in this case, it doesn't increase their suffering. Humor is our way of dealing with things, as humans. And frankly, the cancer episode is more or less a vehicle for great irony. Think about it. Frylock invents a time machine. Then he gets cancer. And what does Master Shake do? He says ""Let's use the time machine to remove Frylock's cancer."" ANybody with a brain would expect them to go back in time, but no, lol, it gets burned to try to ""smoke the cancer out."" Perfect irony.

In regards to the quality of the show this volume-- it is not as content rich as Season 4 was. But come on people, COME OOOOOOOOOOON. You can't blame the writers, who spent most the season creating a full length movie for the fans, for the fact that they had less ideas in Season 5. I am glad they dedicated their efforts to a movie-- which I also own-- and that I have that AND volume 5 to enjoy, not just one, or the other.

All in all, volumes 3 and 4 are the best. But season 5 is plenty good for any fan and when combined with the others and the movie there's plenty of material available until the next volume arrives.",1202428800,3,1827,4.354838709677419

2957069,2,B000VWX6SA,"I'm an avid and long time fan of Aqua Teen. The first episode I ever witnessed was the mummy episode. I ran across it one night while channel surfing, and decided that I would stop to see what this strange looking cartoon was all about. I cracked up with the off-beat humor and just had a great time watching it; and consequently have been an avid fan ever since.

For me, episodes of Aqua Teen rarely disappoint. This season was the first time that I got done watching an episode and just sat there with a dropped jaw and thought, ""that was it?"". ""Where was the funny part?"" After a couple of really bad episodes I got an almost sick feeling in my stomach because it got me thinking that the good days of the show may be over.

Now I am NOT ""shocked"" or ""disturbed"" by some of the content of these episodes like many of the other people on here posting reviews. The episodes that I did not enjoy, I didn't enjoy them because they simply weren't funny. It's as though the creators just said, ""let's see how much crazy stuff we can throw into 15 minutes...and our drugged-up fans will eat it up."" ""Forget all that script stuff...you know...and the uhhhh.....dialog part, and fcuk trying to make it slapstick funny, let's just make senselessness and junk.""

ex: The Carl Wash episode: Seriously? Was I supposed to laugh at some point in that? I don't know if the creators were distracted because of them being focused on the the movie, or what, because I thought the movie was great. The movie had that great dialog-driven humor and character interaction that has made ATHF so enjoyable. Oh, and the Moonajuana episode. When I bought the dvd set I saw Moonajuana on the back of case and was immediately ecstatic to watch it, as most of the mooninite episodes are classic. By far the worst mooninite episode to date. Awful in fact. I didn't even crack a smile the entire time.

Now some of the episodes are funny. Dirtfoot gave me some laughs but not a great episode. Dickesode cracked me up the first time I watched it. The last two episodes which are deleted movie scenes are good, classic aqua teen. I actually enjoyed the Hand Banana episode, it wasn't amazing but it was funny and most certainly did not disturb me.

Anyway, I guess my point is...I was not troubled by these episodes. I was not horribly mortified. I don't want to go home and chop my balls off. My humble opinion is just this...the episodes on this latest season are just plain not very good. Very inconsistent. Some good ones, but for the most part they are very stale, unfunny, and just plain lame. It's as though they just don't care anymore about the material they are putting out.

Perhaps the shows modest success has become a sort of detriment, and god forbid it's demise. Let's hope not. I'm gonna pray like hell that they(the creators) have some more classic shows left and that next season they will be back in true form.

Note: I almost forgot...one other thing...no more Dr. Weird or Spacecataz at the start of the shows now. No opening sketch or anything. This also was a bummer.",1202083200,14,3061,4.514440433212997
2957070,4,B000VWX6SA,"I am utterly amazed at how many people are ""disgusted"" ""disturbed"" and outright bothered by this season's episodes.  The comments all pretty much read the same.  ""I loved all their episodes till (insert last straw comment here)""  Cancer and rape are two very real, very concern worthy issues of course, but like most of television the creators of ATHF simply took something serious and put a humorous spin on it.

Now I myself am a childhood cancer survivor but that has nothing to do with why I didn't find that particular episode funny.  It just simply didn't do anything for me *shrugs* I wasn't outraged and shaking my fists in the air yelling ""How dare they make fun of cancer!"" like it seems quite a few people were.

The Handbanana episode however had me in tears I was laughing so hard. I've had several people close to me become victims of rape and I understand how devastating it can be.  But come on people! It's a dog that's in the shape (and color) of Shake's hand!  And to reference another reviewer here, the lines Carl and Handbanana deliver are hilarious and I quote them often just for my own amusement.

The Dickisode was another episode that had me clutching my sides as I laughed till I cried.  Hey, some of us respond to that childish kind of humor.  Once again I don't find it any more shocking or immature than any of their previous episodes.

I enjoyed, for the most part, all of Season 5.  I think it was an excellent follow up to Season 4 which has 2 of my most favorite ATHF episodes to date (Gee Whiz & eDork). Of course now I'm wondering, how did many people deal with ATHF poking fun at the Standards & Practices with religion of our culture today?

To sum up, many people consider themselves objective until a subject they feel strongly about is made fun of.  I hate to think how many people gave up on the show simply because the creators did what they do best, push the envelope.",1201910400,5,1913,4.441260744985673
2957071,3,B000VWX6SA,"The fifth volume of Adult Swim's most popular original show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, is a pretty mixed bag when compared to previous volumes of the series.

While those two aforementioned episodes, along with ""Boost Mobile"", the outrageous ""Hand Banana"", and ""Global Grilling"" are great episodes to be sure, the set as a whole also features some moments that just aren't that funny.  ""Dickesode"", ""Moonajuana"", and ""Carl Wash"" just come off as more annoying than anything else, and are devoid of any of the outright hilarity and insanity that made Aqua Teen Hunger Force so good in the first place.  Not to mention, what has been mentioned so much here already, but seeing Frylock wither away and die of cancer well, it really isn't funny.  While I admire Dave Willis and co. to go for broke with nothing sacred, seeing what happens to Frylock amongst all the usual Aqua Teen chaos is more disturbing than anything else.  That aside, Volume 5 of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is worth picking up for die hard fans of the series, but more casual fans of the series may find themselves put off by what's found here.",1201824000,9,1428,4.8559670781893

If this had been the first season, there would have been no second season.  I don't waste my money on cable so I eagerly waited for the DVDs to come out, and I was utterly, utterly, dissappointed.  Out of 14 episodes, I never smiled once and I laughed exactly one time, when Shake runs out to Carl's pool and it is all melted.  Mainly, I felt uncomfortable the whole time, I think because I felt embarassed to be watching how unfunny all of this was.  Every episode was bad.  Even the Extras were bad.  The reviewers who liked this seem to forget that this is supposed to be a comedy show.  How anybody could watch the ""clip show"" or the one with the alien tower slowly killing Carl or Frylock's cancer and get humor out of it is beyond me.  If you pay attention, you will notice that there are no jokes in any of these episodes.  There are few new characters (Mucusmen???) and they are unlikeable and poorly animated.  The main characters try to kill themselves and not in a humorous way or with funny motivation, i.e. Shake killing himself to mess up Meatwad's video game.  This whole season is just a mess.  If you like ATHF and you haven't seen these episodes, don't; not even for intellectual curiosity.  Take my word for it.  You do not want to see these episodes, not one of them.  Maybe Matt and Dave will pull it out of this death spiral for season six.  I would hope that they would get to keep going for another season based on 1 - 4, because if this were the last season, it would be a complete tragedy.  Also, who did the subtitles?  Dance Finger Puppets?  And does it seem to anybody else that the opening theme music is playing slower than before?",1201824000,10,1820,4.247813411078718

That being said:

The episode where Frylock gets cancer isn't remotely funny.  Bart Oates episode, mildly funny in theory.  Handbanana - downright disturbing.

Purchase this box set at your own risk.

P.S. - Favorite ep. - Hypnogerm",1201564800,6,320,4.709090909090909
2957075,5,B000VWX6SA,"Well i cant wait till this is released- i watch the other dvd sets all the time and never tire of them. This set looks like it has some classics and despite being darker and more violent remember its just a cartoon. Watch CNN and then complain about real violence. As far as the Joyce argument goes she has her right to her opinion but i must disagree with her comments on the Cancer episode- Cancer isn't pretty and i think the ""withering away"" of Frylock makes it atleast honest. My family has lost many members to cancer- i was not offended at all and did laugh. I think its great to be able to laugh at what life may throw at us and thats what makes us human. The ability to rise above, joke,  and disregard our troubles as we carry on. I think the only thing out of line would be joking about child molestation and South Park has already walked that tightrope numerous times. Cartoons are nothing compared to the Bushes Bin Ladens and Jeffrey Dahmers of the world and i will never be threatened by a cartoon personally but to each his own.",1201046400,9,1044,4.299492385786802

Hand Banana is probably my favorite episode of the series after Total Recarl.",1200614400,4,271,4.530612244897959
3191497,5,B000VWX6SA,First of all Season 5 was AWESOME! As far as Joyces term paper down there... PLEASE! Rubbish is what I say of that. Just go bugger off somewhere! ATHF is and will always be great. so there.,1200441600,4,189,4.135135135135135
3191498,1,B000VWX6SA,"I generally agree with Joyce's opinion, but for a slightly different reason.  I didn't object to the violent content, but to the overall ""mean-spiritedness"" of the episodes in the 5th season.  In addition to that, these episodes didn't have enough of what makes the show great--the banter between the ATHF in their house.  Really they don't seem to have the same sense of humor, as if they were written by another person.  I think you can pick up on this change at the end of the 4th season as well (in particular, the episode focusing entirely on Carl, where the ATHF go on vacation, is just gross and not funny at all....at the time I thought THAT episode was just a fluke.  But after the first two episodes of Season 5 came out, I was ready to give up on the show...).  THEY'VE LOST THEIR WAY.

Joyce said ""And so, if you want some great animation that might actually make you feel BETTER and that there actually IS some magic out there....""
I would recommend the first twenty or so episodes of The Backyardigans, one of my favorite shows until the creators ALSO lost their way in the most recent season (but in a much less offensive way).....",1200268800,9,1146,4.480769230769231
3191499,5,B000VWX6SA,"What Joyce doesn't seem to understand is ATHF is how it's humor is shaped. The whole series is based on character interaction rather than plotlines for humor. Those who are true fans of the series understand that ATHF is made up of half-baked plots and shocking character interaction and of course, Joyce, ruthless violence. This isn't suppose to be a mind simulating program, where the plot and characters are appliable to our lives, such as South Park has become. Dont get me wrong, with the exception of Season 10, I love EVERY South Park season. But ATHF is a completely different show, and draws it's humor from different elements.
That being said, first time watchers might not enjoy this. The stories are far fetched and hard to appreciate without already being in love with these characters. But, in my opinion, this is the best ATHF yet. I didn't like season 4 as much as the first 3, but with such classics as ""Dickesode"",""Handbanana"", ""Boost Mobile"", ""Bart Oates"", and ""Dirtfoot"", season 5 definitely seems to be a comeback for the series. BEST EPISODES:
1. ""Handbanana""-The whole episode is hilarious. It's hard to put it as #1, because there are so many great episodes. But Carl has the funniest one-liners over every other character.
2.""Dickesode""-Call me immature, but no matter how many times it is said, the word ""dick"" never ceases to be funny to me. Plus the little dick collectors are hilarious. ""So...Whos gonna get their dick ripped off tonight?"" haha
3.""Dirtfoot""-Shake falls down a well and meets his soon-to-be-roommate Dirtfoot, little do they know Dirtfoot has a HUGE secret. This one's very funny. Once again, hard to put these in any particular order.
4.""Bart Oates""-As I write these, I realize how heavily Carl was implemented into season 5. The character interaction between Carl and former NFL lineman Bart Oates is hilarious. As they attempt to repent for Carls mistakes, Carl uncovers a mystery about Bart Oates. Note: This is why kids shouldn't play with bb guns.
5.""Boost Mobile""-I can't even explain why this is so funny. Just watch it. ""Where you at, dog?""
Overall, this season will not disappoint for long-time fans, but will probably turn away many first time viewers.",1200268800,7,2208,4.954177897574124
3191500,4,B000VWX6SA,"Joyce, you present an interesting argument, and although ATHF has changed a bit in this latest season, Carl has been repeatedly killed through-out the series (he's been skinned, had his upper body blown off by Ted Nugent, had his arms ripped off an eaten by Willie Nelson (the monster), defenestrated himself and other deaths). Hand Bannana was a bit over the top, but all in all, it wasn't completely unexpected from ATHF. It took a little adjusting, but I kind of like the new ones. I will admit, I haven't seen the one with Frylock having cancer yet(Not really looking forward to that particular episode), but I think even more depressing was the one where Frylock moves out and leaves Meatwad and Shake alone and starving in a house full of rotting chickens.

I will admit, I've known a lot of people who consume without thought, but when a series takes a new direction, it can be a good thing. Besides, South Park had a few seasons where I just kind of lost interest, and then they seemed to get it back. Things like ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" was a bit too far out (blood orgies and the like), but it was still amusing in places. Eventually they seemed to fall back into cool episodes, and I thought their latest DVD release was pretty sweet (As a former PC technician, I got a kick out of the W.O.W. players as they looked rather familiar).

BTW: I loved the Azamanga Diaoh series (I bought the box and have seen them all), but it's a slower kind of humor. In relation to Aqua Teen it's night and day. As far as the decline of values on American TV, when we the shocking becomes boring, we move back towards actual plotlines. I've seen a ton of movies from the 50s because they're a break from the frantic race of special effects and shock values. Give it a few years and come back to this series and you'll probably wonder what the big deal was because something new and more intense will to have made this look tame in comparison...",1199404800,8,1943,4.470422535211267
3191501,5,B000VWX6SA,"or Hand Bannana will rape you!

(i think hand bannana may have been the best new character in the show so far... next to danzig or the billy witch doctor...)",1199318400,16,157,4.233333333333333
3191502,1,B000VWX6SA,"This is a very long review that's been building up in me for a long time and I was hoping this set would never be released. If you've seen these episodes and loved them, just ignore me and place your order. If you, like me, have grown tired of all the negativity, banality, and just plain EVIL-ness of modern American television, then go ahead and read if you want to...

I am writing this as an owner and huge fan of ATHF Vols. 1 thru 4, just so you know that I'm not just slamming a product because I hate the show or simply have nothing better to do.

When Season 5 was almost ready to start on Cartoon Network last year, I was so incredibly psyched that I made my mother think I was a little insane - she saw me standing up cheering at that weird Meatwad promo commercial while freaky music is playing in the background. But now thanks to season 5, I think I just might have BECOME a little insane.

I understand that thanks to years of ultra-violence being overshown in movies and on late-night TV we've all become almost completely desensitized. People getting shot in the face, decapitated, shot in the knees, disembowelled, shot in the groin, run over, shot in the hands, stabbed, pushed off a building, etc. just doesn't freak us out anymore. So directors started being CUTE about it - the ultra-fast hit-by-a-truck scene in Final Destination, is one example. But a lot of people have caught on to even this, especially college-aged kids nowadays who have fond memories of sittng on Daddy's lap while he played Doom on the computer after work.

So now we have shows that must push the envelope beyond anything ever done before... Some, like Metalocalypse, manage to do it in a way that really doesn't bother me - there's real humor there, plus the violence feels more comical than ghastly, the animation is superb, it reminds me of those cool Iron Maiden album covers from the 1970's, etc. I mention this only to emphasize that I'm not some anti-violence zealot out to trash television shows. So long as it's good and there's a real story, I don't mind violence. It's the 'no hope in sight' culture we have going on nowadays that gets to me - violence and shocking situations used just so nobody has to actually write a STORY. I go into this a little more near the end~

Saying that, there's something...OFF...about the new Aqua Teen cartoons. When I saw the episode where Carl wins a free (and mandatory)'Get Your Penis Cut Off' after he and the Force go shopping at a convenience store, I figured it was just a bad-episode fluke since the creators were busy at the time working hard on ""Colon"". The episode really bothered me though, for some reason. I know, it's CARL we're talking about, who's basically Archie Bunker with raging hormones, without the hidden 'softer side', and without anyone who loves him... but still.

Then came the episodes that made me really really sick. And I mean PHYSICALLY nauseous amd temporarily depressed. The first of which was about a big long yellow balloon-like dog that Master Shake creates out back in Carl's pool - though it may as well have risen out of the blood pools of HELL. First off, it just LOOKS evil - and it proves his alignment by threatening Carl over the phone, breaking into his house, and anally raping him in a very brutal scene (even though you only see Handbanana (the ""dog's"" name) through Carl's window from outside). Again, you might say it's CARL that it's happening to - but does that really mean that rape is OK so long as you don't like the person it's happening to?

""Oh lighten up - it's just a cartoon!"" I'm sure a lot of violence-desensitive, die-hard fans are saying that right now. Except it's NOT just a cartoon. Anyone who's seen all the other episodes knows this, otherwise you wouldn't CARE what I say about it. To us fans it's become a universe unto itself in our subconsciousnesses - the characters have become real to us in the back of our minds - why d'ya think all those Trekkies (or Star Wars fanatics) keep going to conventions dressed up as Klingons (or Jedis), and it's also why housewives really believe Kirk is secretly having sex with Jeannie on their soap opera and why millions of Americans NEEDED to see Ross and Rachel get back together on the final episode of Friends. It just HAPPENS when you watch (and love) a TV program for a very long time. So yes, bad things have happened to characters in Aqua Teen Hunger Force before - but never quite like this. It really really bothered me. I'm sure that a lot of you will still disagree with me and loved the 5th season episodes, but like I said before - while I was watching them, it felt like something was kind of off or wrong somehow. Could just be bad direting too, though.

The episode that pre-empted my watching the rest of the series was the one where I had to watch Frylock slowly die of cancer. You can tell they really tried to make it disturbing too, the way the fries begin to wither and rot, and THIS I can say with probably no argument: cancer isn't funny. It never was and never will be. South Park went ahead after this aired and put out ""Stanley's Cup"" which is one of the lowest-rated episodes in the show's history.

I just don't know what the hell they're trying to do or say with ATHF anymore and it feels like every show on Adult Swim is violent and/or sickening in their quest for viewers - farewell, Space Ghost! - but to be fair, like I said in paragraph seven, I stopped watching the episodes after the Frylock death ep so I only saw about half the episodes total. The other episodes were just...there. I don't really remember them so they couldn't have been that bad. They were just overshadowed by the darkness looming from the ones I mentioned. But this set still deserves one star because of the way it basically killed ATHF for me. It'll be a long time before I can watch the other four sets, and I'll never watch another new episode again - ever. I just can't stand what's become of the show.

One last note - I really hope we somehow get back to entertainment without needing to resort to violence to get people to watch - violence is fine if it's PART of the story, just so long as it isn't over-used because there simply IS no story. Carl getting his penis cut off is a good example because that IS the whole story. No creativity is used in that episode whatsoever. Same goes for Frylock having cancer - just wither him away while other characters react - that's it. No story is present in that episode, just the destruction of a character I happen to like. Now, Handbanana may be creative at least, but the violence bothered me so much that I'm pretty sure that this set easily made it into Satan's DVD library.

I used to believe that 'kids these days' were becoming unemotional, uncaring mega-consumers who live minute by minute - demanding to be entertained with quick and shocking bits of video and with as little thinking involved as possible. There's a lot of evidence to support this - and I had neighbors who WERE like this - but I also found out fairly recently that there's also a lot of 'kids these days' who are tired. Tired of being treated like nothing but a consumer of gadgets, tired of being told what music is 'cutting edge' and 'rebellious' by white men in suits sitting around an office all day, and tired of being shown sick GARBAGE like Deal Or No Deal, Boiling Point, My Sweet Sixteen, and season five of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. A lot of them get depressed because, well, I think it's pretty obvious with just what our culture has to offer nowadays, never mind everything else. If THIS is what we're being offered as escapism from day-to-day problems, we're in a lot of trouble.

And so, if you want some great animation that might actually make you feel BETTER and that there actually IS some magic out there, where your dreams don't necessarily have to die like Frylock did in that episode, use your money to get the complete set of Azumanga Daioh and/or the three volumes of a show called Strawberry Marshmallow (it's a poofy name, but an emotionally uplifting show. Both are Japanese and I HIGHLY recommend seeing them that way with the subtitles, but they're also English dubbed, naturally). I have to recommend these shows as strongly as possible in case someone's reading this who feels like I do or understands what I'm trying to say. Watch these and I guarantee you'll get a little more hope back that there IS still magic out there, and that there's emotionally involving stories, characters that come to life (the animated characters feel more real than anyone on Prison Break or Lost or Grey's Anatomy - and I mean that as a fan of two of those three shows!) We used to have magical heartfelt shows in this country - heck, season one of Aqua Teen was one of them! - so hopefully someday the magic will return.",1199145600,48,8830,4.501559575795383

The rest are mostly pretty good, and a few decidedly weak.

While this series has worn off a bit from when I was first enthralled by the sheer dada-esque insanity, the best episodes still transcend to amazing levels of bizarre, gross, surreal humor.

How is it not funny that Frylock has cancer, yet in the very same scene, Shake eats a scorpion and is choking on it and dying? Why can choking and people's heads getting blown off be funny, but as soon as it turns into a ""serious"" issue, the fact that death is imminent more serious? If this was the case, people would be sad and outraged when, in season 4, shake took a bottle of sleeping pills, put a hose in his mouth that was attached to the tailpipe of Carl's running car, and jumped in a pool of piranhas. But no, that's pretty damn funny, but Frylock's ""cancer"" is not? I think sometimes people need to relax and just go with the flow. NOTHING is really serious in ATHF and it's been like that from season 1. If you've just noticed it now than you've really been out of it.
  With that said, this is just another funny season that can be added to your collection of favorites. Also, (to everyone's overjoyment most likely) the ""play all"" feature is back.",1239926400,3,1075,4.316831683168317

3191548,3,B000VWX6SA,"I've seen some reviewers on here who were disturbed by some of the latest episodes on the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume Five DVD collection. While I don't think cancer or rape are funny in real life, you have to remember that this is a CARTOON. It's not real. Having said that, I have to admit that this season wasn't as funny as the last season. The show seems to have lost a lot of the hilarious dialogue that made it so damned funny when it first came out, especially the nonsensical rambling of Shake and Meatwad together. The writing was lack luster, and the episodes seemed to have no plot and ended simply because the time alloted to them on adult swim had run out. The movie, I think, was a return to the comedy that made us fall in love with the show to begin with. However, there are some gems in this box set. For example, Shake's radioactive grill is probably the funniest episode on her after Handbanana. Grim Reaper Gutters isn't bad, and Dickesode was funny, but it could have been better. DirtFoot was a dud, and Antenna was stupid. Ezekiel was funny, though. So was the Super Star Studded Christmas Spectacular. All in all, to hardcore fans, it's worth buying. To the casual viewer who just flips channels late at night, it's not worth your buck.

Volume 5 is for fans of the show only, though the Boost Mobile episode was an instant classic. The show took a bizzarre, edgy and weird-for-the-sake-of-weird turn. It's almost in the tradition of Modernist playwrights like Harold Pinter at times. The episode ""Party All The Time"" is more art than cartoon, and plays with your emotions more than you thought possible from a ""stoner cartoon"". This volume proves ATHF is smart, and loves to push the boundaries of TV and the concept of Cartoons in general.

The writing is freaking great. The characters are all great. It's a great fuhking show, period. One of the most original and inspired TV shows ever. Don't let anyone deny it. It isn't remotely intended for everybody. Aqua Teen Hinger Force IS art.

Agree that season 5 is particularly for the already converted serious fans, and not the best season to start with. So, if somehow you haven't already been a fan for years now and haven't experienced earlier episodes go back to seasons 1,2,3, & 4.",1204329600,,839,4.343949044585988

Some were disappointed with it, some were offended and some feel the series has jumped the proverbial shark. However, I loved this season, and feel it's very underrated.
It's not the best season, I feel that the best season of the show was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aqua-Teen-Hunger-Force-Vol-4/dp/B000B5XOR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 4</a>. Season five takes some risks and most of them pay off, at least for me.

There are two controversial episodes in this set that really have divided fans and their opinions on the show. I think most fans of the show agree that the hand banana episode sank like a stone. I understand what the creators were trying to do, make a very unfunny subject like rape, funny, but it just doesn't work. On the other hand, the other controversial episode were Frylock is dying of cancer was very funny to me. I've had family members and a dear friend die of cancer, but I still thought this episode was funny. It's a surreal and an absurd episode that I think people are making too much about. If you don't think it's funny, read the banner the guys hang in the house welcoming Frylock home from the hospital. Plus, the use of Andrew WK (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Get-Wet/dp/B00005RY7X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Get Wet</a>)  performing a party song is more proof that this episode isn't meant to be taken seriously.
With that said, there are some undeniably great episodes in this season. ""Global Grilling"" is Aqua Teen at their best. Anyone who feels the show has lost a step since season 3 should see this episode, they'll reconsider those feelings. The ""Dickesode"" is much funnier now that it's uncensored. The scene where Meatwad re-enacts a tv commercial with puppets, since they don't have Tivo, is classic! Other great episodes include: ""Dirtfoot"", ""Boost Mobile"", ""Carl Wash"", ""Grim Reaper Gutters"" and ""Ezekiel"". The 2-part ""Star Studded Christmas Spectacular"" is also good, since it contains finished footage cut from the Aqua Teen movie, that is a million time better than anything seen in the movie! The rest of the episodes are pretty decent as well, with the only real duds being ""Hand Banana"" and ""Bart Oates"".

The DVD packaging is a nice digipak, like previous editions and they've included a sheet of Aqua Teen Hunger Force stickers with this set, which I thought was pretty creative. Extras include adult film star Tera Patrick recording her vocals for the ""Grim Reaper Gutters"" episode, deleted scenes (too short), ""Learn to Shred Like the Master"", ""The Worst Game Ever"" (loved it) and more.

Overall, not the greatest season of the series ever, but it's not the disaster some fans would have you believe. The show is still cutting edge, creative and most importantly... funny. With the never ending war and an economy that's going to go from bad to worse long before it gets better... a few laughs are in high demand these days.

3191560,3,B000VWX6SA,"While this season is not my favorite, I'm genuinely surprised at the reactions in some of the 1 star reviews. Guys, we're talking aqua teen here. I'm a fan of some of the ""alternatively"" suggested shows in those reviews, like Azumanga Diaoh, but this is an apples and oranges comparison.

ATHF has always been at its core, like south park, pushing taste and using shock for its humor. Is Carl being raped by Handbanna or Frylocks cancer any less disturbing then Carl having his skin ripped off by trees, or Santa Clause burned and mutilated, and screaming in pain? The tone in this season didn't strike me as any different.

I thought some episodes were very funny (I really enjoyed Dirtfoot, and Grim Reaper Gutters) Some were funny and yet disturbing (Handbanna...and to answer Joyce's question I don't find rape funny,  but this is fiction. And what's happening is absurd. We know next episode, the slate is wiped clean, and what I found funny about it was the absurd and impossible situation, not the rape itself. I don't think people that found this amusing are some kind of evil sadist. I don't find real Murder or Suicide or cruelty funny, and yet ATHF is full of these too, and Joyce admits to being a fan before this. Should I assume J thinks these things are ok in real life because they've enjoyed the show in the past? Of course not.) Some episodes didn't do anything for me (The deleted scenes from the movie episode I found boring.)

I felt this way about the extras too. Some were very amusing (I liked the space Ghost ATHF premier, and the SGCTC with the brain shampoo best.)  The live tapings of grandma's voice session, and Tara whats-her-name, the porn actress, were amusing as well. Some were ok, the responses to the critics, the game trailer, and the deleted scenes, and some I thought were really terrible: The guitar lesson video, and the worst game in the world (although at least it was honest)

Its not the best season, mostly for its uneven feeling, but I don't feel that I wasted my $20 on it.  I just think that trying to analyze it as anything but what the show has always been is reading far too into it. If you believe that rape and murder in fiction leads someone to do these things in real life, then stay away from this show. Not just season 5, but the whole thing. For the rest of us that can separate fiction from reality, it may be a worthy buy if you've enjoyed the rest of the show. I'd suggest viewing first before you buy if you can.",1202860800,,2476,4.476718403547672
3191561,3,B000VWX6SA,"In another of my reviews of this series, I pointed out how old-fashioned the humor of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is.  That is, it is sharp and raw, like the bodily-function humor of Dante or Chaucer (if you think ATHF is not for the faint of heart, stay away from ""The Inferno"" of Dante, or The Canterbury Tales).  It also presents fair specimens of human behavior, and examines them through the prism of our main characters, the Aqua Teens (and to a lesser extent, Carl).

Here, as before, the standard ATHF plot is at work; the Aqua Teens have their daily lives interrupted by a strange, or otherworldy character.  In this season, the strangers range from quasi-celebrities like pro footballer Bart Oates and porn-queen Tera Patrick, to chimeric figures like Hand Banana, mini-shake Ezekiel, or the nefarious Dr. Wongburger.

Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis stick to what they do best, as well; writing great dialogue.  Every line has a purpose -- it either sets up a joke or finishes it.  In especially fertile patches, every line will serve both of these ends, to the point where the writing is so dense with brilliancies that four or five viewings are required to get every joke.  Of particular note in this regard are the episodes ""Ezekiel"" and ""Hand Banana"".  These two, in particular, strike me as the funniest in the entire ATHF catalogue (keeping in mind, of course, classics like ""Mail Order Bride"", ""Carl"" and ""Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Future"").

The show weakens when it relies too heavily on the celebrity appearance; this is the case with the Tera Patrick episode.  It's harder to be funny with this lubricious caricature (voiced by the porn queen herself) spending the entire episode crawling around on all fours.  ATHF's strength comes from the ""closed circuit"" nature of its humor -- unlike ""Family Guy"" (or ""The Simpsons"" or ""South Park"") the allusions to popular culture are usually kept to a minimum, and the show is stronger as a result.",1202688000,,1959,4.84984984984985
3191562,3,B000VWX6SA,"Okay, there are so many comments about how disturbing this is.  And yes, maybe I am desensitized by things like this, but I personally don't care and I don't think I'm all that desensitized.  I didn't find this all that disturbing, anyone who can read de Sade and not be disturbed will find nothing disturbing in this.

Regardless I don't think this was top notch compared to the other volumes.  It's been a while since Volume 4 came out and I was pretty excited to get Volume 5 because I hadn't seen any of it on TV.  After watching this with my friends I seriously think they may have over extended themselves by writing a movie.  The writing on most of these episodes is just bad and it seems they have replaced humor with extremity.  Which can be done in a hilarious fashion, but it lacked writing.  Like Dickesode... that started off strong and ended stupidly.

Volume 5 is really hit or miss with me, because it does have a few great episodes, but it also has some episodes that just aren't funny.  It also has others that just have a single funny moment, like when Carl got a lobotomy in Carlwash and he was licking his car afterwards... hilarious, but the rest was pretty bland.  I really liked Global Grilling though, I thought that episode was pretty smart and absolutely hilarious.  I also liked most of Hand Banana, and the rape part didn't disturb me (again, I've read de Sade)... it's a yellow hand dog... it's not even a real creature.  However, the end of the episode where Carl made his own dog, for some reason it kind of ended for me, it wasn't funny at that part, it just seemed like a forced conclusion.

I'm hoping that the lack of creativity is because they were spending their time writing a good movie and that Volume 6 will get back on track.  It just seems like their creativity was exhausted, and this season was more bland than others.  I will probably pick up a Volume 6, but extremity for extremity's sake is kind of boring after a while, so I hope they focus on the writing in the future.",1202688000,6,2020,4.418918918918919
3191563,4,B000VWX6SA,"I am seeing a lot of comments regarding the cancer episode, ""Party all the Time."" People say it is sick, isn't funny, and is insensitive. First off let me say I have just recently lost a friend of the family to cancer, so I am aware of how serious it is. But since the beginning of time, we have coped with the realities of the world with humor. Ever heard the term ""Oh The Humanity!"" which gets thrown around all the time? Well, people used to get burned alive, and that's what they screamed, and later it became something people would sarcastically say anytime something seemed crappy. Guess what? It doesn't make the suffering of real people any harsher. Joking about cancer doesn't make more people suffer from it, and in this case, it doesn't increase their suffering. Humor is our way of dealing with things, as humans. And frankly, the cancer episode is more or less a vehicle for great irony. Think about it. Frylock invents a time machine. Then he gets cancer. And what does Master Shake do? He says ""Let's use the time machine to remove Frylock's cancer."" ANybody with a brain would expect them to go back in time, but no, lol, it gets burned to try to ""smoke the cancer out."" Perfect irony.

In regards to the quality of the show this volume-- it is not as content rich as Season 4 was. But come on people, COME OOOOOOOOOOON. You can't blame the writers, who spent most the season creating a full length movie for the fans, for the fact that they had less ideas in Season 5. I am glad they dedicated their efforts to a movie-- which I also own-- and that I have that AND volume 5 to enjoy, not just one, or the other.

All in all, volumes 3 and 4 are the best. But season 5 is plenty good for any fan and when combined with the others and the movie there's plenty of material available until the next volume arrives.",1202428800,3,1827,4.354838709677419

3191566,2,B000VWX6SA,"I'm an avid and long time fan of Aqua Teen. The first episode I ever witnessed was the mummy episode. I ran across it one night while channel surfing, and decided that I would stop to see what this strange looking cartoon was all about. I cracked up with the off-beat humor and just had a great time watching it; and consequently have been an avid fan ever since.

For me, episodes of Aqua Teen rarely disappoint. This season was the first time that I got done watching an episode and just sat there with a dropped jaw and thought, ""that was it?"". ""Where was the funny part?"" After a couple of really bad episodes I got an almost sick feeling in my stomach because it got me thinking that the good days of the show may be over.

Now I am NOT ""shocked"" or ""disturbed"" by some of the content of these episodes like many of the other people on here posting reviews. The episodes that I did not enjoy, I didn't enjoy them because they simply weren't funny. It's as though the creators just said, ""let's see how much crazy stuff we can throw into 15 minutes...and our drugged-up fans will eat it up."" ""Forget all that script stuff...you know...and the uhhhh.....dialog part, and fcuk trying to make it slapstick funny, let's just make senselessness and junk.""

ex: The Carl Wash episode: Seriously? Was I supposed to laugh at some point in that? I don't know if the creators were distracted because of them being focused on the the movie, or what, because I thought the movie was great. The movie had that great dialog-driven humor and character interaction that has made ATHF so enjoyable. Oh, and the Moonajuana episode. When I bought the dvd set I saw Moonajuana on the back of case and was immediately ecstatic to watch it, as most of the mooninite episodes are classic. By far the worst mooninite episode to date. Awful in fact. I didn't even crack a smile the entire time.

Now some of the episodes are funny. Dirtfoot gave me some laughs but not a great episode. Dickesode cracked me up the first time I watched it. The last two episodes which are deleted movie scenes are good, classic aqua teen. I actually enjoyed the Hand Banana episode, it wasn't amazing but it was funny and most certainly did not disturb me.

Anyway, I guess my point is...I was not troubled by these episodes. I was not horribly mortified. I don't want to go home and chop my balls off. My humble opinion is just this...the episodes on this latest season are just plain not very good. Very inconsistent. Some good ones, but for the most part they are very stale, unfunny, and just plain lame. It's as though they just don't care anymore about the material they are putting out.

Perhaps the shows modest success has become a sort of detriment, and god forbid it's demise. Let's hope not. I'm gonna pray like hell that they(the creators) have some more classic shows left and that next season they will be back in true form.

Note: I almost forgot...one other thing...no more Dr. Weird or Spacecataz at the start of the shows now. No opening sketch or anything. This also was a bummer.",1202083200,14,3061,4.514440433212997
3191567,4,B000VWX6SA,"I am utterly amazed at how many people are ""disgusted"" ""disturbed"" and outright bothered by this season's episodes.  The comments all pretty much read the same.  ""I loved all their episodes till (insert last straw comment here)""  Cancer and rape are two very real, very concern worthy issues of course, but like most of television the creators of ATHF simply took something serious and put a humorous spin on it.

Now I myself am a childhood cancer survivor but that has nothing to do with why I didn't find that particular episode funny.  It just simply didn't do anything for me *shrugs* I wasn't outraged and shaking my fists in the air yelling ""How dare they make fun of cancer!"" like it seems quite a few people were.

The Handbanana episode however had me in tears I was laughing so hard. I've had several people close to me become victims of rape and I understand how devastating it can be.  But come on people! It's a dog that's in the shape (and color) of Shake's hand!  And to reference another reviewer here, the lines Carl and Handbanana deliver are hilarious and I quote them often just for my own amusement.

The Dickisode was another episode that had me clutching my sides as I laughed till I cried.  Hey, some of us respond to that childish kind of humor.  Once again I don't find it any more shocking or immature than any of their previous episodes.

I enjoyed, for the most part, all of Season 5.  I think it was an excellent follow up to Season 4 which has 2 of my most favorite ATHF episodes to date (Gee Whiz & eDork). Of course now I'm wondering, how did many people deal with ATHF poking fun at the Standards & Practices with religion of our culture today?

To sum up, many people consider themselves objective until a subject they feel strongly about is made fun of.  I hate to think how many people gave up on the show simply because the creators did what they do best, push the envelope.",1201910400,5,1913,4.441260744985673
3191568,3,B000VWX6SA,"The fifth volume of Adult Swim's most popular original show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, is a pretty mixed bag when compared to previous volumes of the series.  All kinds of things happen to Master Shake, Frylock, Meatwad, and Carl in this collection, including Shake moving in with a legendary New Jersey monster (""Dirtfoot"") and Carl trying to avoid losing his manhood (""Dickesode""), along with many other horrible things that happen to him throughout the episodes collected here.  While those two aforementioned episodes, along with ""Boost Mobile"", the outrageous ""Hand Banana"", and ""Global Grilling"" are great episodes to be sure, the set as a whole also features some moments that just aren't that funny.  ""Dickesode"", ""Moonajuana"", and ""Carl Wash"" just come off as more annoying than anything else, and are devoid of any of the outright hilarity and insanity that made Aqua Teen Hunger Force so good in the first place.  Not to mention, what has been mentioned so much here already, but seeing Frylock wither away and die of cancer well, it really isn't funny.  While I admire Dave Willis and co. to go for broke with nothing sacred, seeing what happens to Frylock amongst all the usual Aqua Teen chaos is more disturbing than anything else.  That aside, Volume 5 of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is worth picking up for die hard fans of the series, but more casual fans of the series may find themselves put off by what's found here.",1201824000,9,1428,4.8559670781893
3191569,1,B000VWX6SA,"All I can ask is What Happened?  I am a huge fan of the first four seasons, they all get five stars, but this is the worst shift in a show I have ever seen.  If this had been the first season, there would have been no second season.  I don't waste my money on cable so I eagerly waited for the DVDs to come out, and I was utterly, utterly, dissappointed.  Out of 14 episodes, I never smiled once and I laughed exactly one time, when Shake runs out to Carl's pool and it is all melted.  Mainly, I felt uncomfortable the whole time, I think because I felt embarassed to be watching how unfunny all of this was.  Every episode was bad.  Even the Extras were bad.  The reviewers who liked this seem to forget that this is supposed to be a comedy show.  How anybody could watch the ""clip show"" or the one with the alien tower slowly killing Carl or Frylock's cancer and get humor out of it is beyond me.  If you pay attention, you will notice that there are no jokes in any of these episodes.  There are few new characters (Mucusmen???) and they are unlikeable and poorly animated.  The main characters try to kill themselves and not in a humorous way or with funny motivation, i.e. Shake killing himself to mess up Meatwad's video game.  This whole season is just a mess.  If you like ATHF and you haven't seen these episodes, don't; not even for intellectual curiosity.  Take my word for it.  You do not want to see these episodes, not one of them.  Maybe Matt and Dave will pull it out of this death spiral for season six.  I would hope that they would get to keep going for another season based on 1 - 4, because if this were the last season, it would be a complete tragedy.  Also, who did the subtitles?  Dance Finger Puppets?  And does it seem to anybody else that the opening theme music is playing slower than before?",1201824000,10,1820,4.247813411078718

That being said:

The episode where Frylock gets cancer isn't remotely funny.  Bart Oates episode, mildly funny in theory.  Handbanana - downright disturbing.

Purchase this box set at your own risk.

3191572,5,B000VWX6SA,"Well i cant wait till this is released- i watch the other dvd sets all the time and never tire of them. This set looks like it has some classics and despite being darker and more violent remember its just a cartoon. Watch CNN and then complain about real violence. As far as the Joyce argument goes she has her right to her opinion but i must disagree with her comments on the Cancer episode- Cancer isn't pretty and i think the ""withering away"" of Frylock makes it atleast honest. My family has lost many members to cancer- i was not offended at all and did laugh. I think its great to be able to laugh at what life may throw at us and thats what makes us human. The ability to rise above, joke,  and disregard our troubles as we carry on. I think the only thing out of line would be joking about child molestation and South Park has already walked that tightrope numerous times. Cartoons are nothing compared to the Bushes Bin Ladens and Jeffrey Dahmers of the world and i will never be threatened by a cartoon personally but to each his own.",1201046400,9,1044,4.299492385786802

Every 3 to 12 days I will happen into the basement to eat a sizable portion of the Lasagna, aged like a fine wine. It just gets better with time.

It's just like Aqua Teen Hunger Force season 5 on dvd. I've watched these episodes hundreds of times, but it doesn't matter. It never gets old.

I wait like a parched mouth aimed upwards at the heavens dying of thirst in the desert. In my mind's eye I am below the gutters on a roof as it rains and a combination of dry leaves and windex pouring through the eaves spouting comes barreling into my dry mouth, and it is a bliss indescribable.

So pack a knapsack full of napkins, plastic eating utensils, yet with no food and a water bottle full of Windex and venture out into the barren wasteland that is the world of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. You will perish here, but you will enjoy doing so.",1506211200,2,975,4.370165745856354
