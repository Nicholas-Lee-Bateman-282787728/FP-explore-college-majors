8506841,2,B006Z9XHB4,"Penelope Smith is a pioneer in the field of animal communication and it was WONDERFUL to be able to see her speak and she does have a few pearls of wisdom here -- but this is quite a short video (28 minutes approximately) and most of it is spent watching wild animals in bare concrete and steel cages, pacing, etc.  Maybe they let the animals out into other enclosures but the enclosures depicted in the film are like the old zoos with absolutely no enrichment items whatsoever, so for me, this was painful to watch.  I wouldn't ask an animal to be caged like this so 10 people could surround it and stare at it for the purposes of learning animal communication, therefore this seemed to send all the wrong messages.

Also, this is mostly watching others silently communicate with animals so not a whole lot to learn other than Penelope's words of wisdom.  I have purchased her beginning course and I'll bet it's far more rich and full of instruction.  I purchased this item and couldn't watch it a second time.",1398124800,4,1011,4.532967032967033
8506842,5,B006Z9XHB4,"I viewed this DVD and view it again.  It really brings home how much we in this ""tech"" society are sooo far away from the earth and animals.  Anyone who loves a dog or cat or turtle or whatever, needs to see what is happening right in front of our eyes and we don't see it!!!!  The Earth and all the spirit-filled beings are welcoming us back home -- to be in touch with the earth, plants and animals.  They are actually crying for us to wake up and see all that is before us as a gift -- a precious gift of planet Earth and all the natural beautiful love of Mother Earth.",1351123200,4,572,3.991228070175439
