5841252,5,B00DPH7RBU,"Every once in a while they come out with anime that is so good you wish they would make a part two. Campione is one of them, I have been watching anime for fifty years and this is one of my favorites of all time. It's a story about a kid that kills a Herectile God and becomes a god slayer. With the help of Knight Erica Brendelli Godo Kusanagi becomes the 7 th king. Not only is she his Knight but also she is in love with him, Godo just can't seem to understand that. Erica helps Godo fight rough gods and along the way other girls find him well in need of their help in on form or another. This is one of the best harem animie videos I have ever seen. Hot chicks hot fights and lots of trouble for the God slayer. Trust me this is just down right funny, hot and wild.",1383350400,3,770,3.910828025477707
5841253,5,B00DPH7RBU,"I'm a big romance and harem genre fan. And when they have awesome fights and mythology, I tend to get hooked on the series. Campione! was no exception.

I started watching Campione! right after the first episode had aired in Japan and had been subbed. After that first episode, I swear I could feel the excitement of the fight that Godoh had felt during his fight with the Persian God of Victory, Verethragna. And after that first episode, I waited and watched each new episode week after week and fell in love with the characters. The story is not much different than most harem animes on the surface: guy gets power, girls fall in love with the guy because of how he uses that power, and the guy is too dense to realize that they are actually in love with him. However, Campione! has a different flair to it: the guy, Godoh Kusanagi, actually needs these girls and has to kiss them if we wants to gather the information used for his strongest authority, the Golden Sword of Verethragna that can cut through Gods. And I loved the steamy scenes between the male and female characters (especially Erica Blandelli) each and every time.

And then, a year later, news came that the show was in the process of being dubbed. I, once more, was excited because I love dubbed anime. So I looked into it and found out who the voice actors and actresses were. Having heard the voices in a number of shows (primarily Infinite Stratos, where most of the stars do the voices of those characters) and I knew that it would be good. However, once I watched the dub, I was blown away. I fell in love all over again with every aspect of the show: the characters, the voices, the music, the plot, the boobs, the fight scenes, the mythology, and the romance. Within the last week, I have watched and rewatched the show numerous times and it is beyond my expectations. In fact, it became my new favorite anime.

I can not tell you how much I recommend this series. It is just amazing. And the best part? There is talk of a second season if people buy the Blu-ray edition, so do buy if you are interested!

(Btw, the light novels, which are found on BakaTsuki if you are interested, are amazing as well!)",1381276800,4,2181,4.445
5841254,5,B00DPH7RBU,"This is truly interesting.  Though I've merely watched the subbed version, I would highly recommend getting the dubbed version too.  And watching it over and over again.",1379721600,,169,5.222222222222222
5841255,2,B00DPH7RBU,"everything about campione, the girls, the attractions, all seems too familiar to me. And so, i have decided not the get the complete collection. don't get me wrong, you still gonna like it. but, you won't watch it twice. the characters are bit overated. oh, by the way, i watched it online with a friend.",1379635200,,304,4.545454545454546
5841256,5,B00DPH7RBU,"Poor Goduu - all he wanted was to return a stone tablet to a friend of his now deceased grandfather - however things get complicated when he gets caught up in a duel with two powerful gods and ends up becoming a Campione - one who has killed a god and gained the Authority of said diety.  Now he has returned to japan with a beautiful blonde knight, Erica in order to protect the country and keep other gods from destroying the world.  But how is he to do this when other Campiones are trying to muscle in on his territory, rogue gods appear, and do not forget the group of lovely ladies who wish to help and train him - not to mention get closer to him.  But can Godu be able to keep his divine promises, or will he be sidetracked with all the distractions that Erica and the others can provide to him.

I just finished this and will get it soon.  A entertaining action harem comedy filled with lovely ladies, explosions, divine battles, and a lot of soul searching.  It is a must to have or watch.",1379462400,7,999,4.204188481675392

Now his daily life has been made more complicated not only by gods who want to kill him but by rival god slayers. He's not alone however as he's companied buy a harem of voluptuous warrior maidens who via for his affection.

 From a fan point of view, campione is one of the best animes to come out in a while. The stories entertaining, the characters are memorable, and the battle scenes are epic and very cinematic. It is a crime this anime didn't get more than just one season. I had also wish to spend money went to Funimation instead of sentai Filmworks, as sentai tends to price there merchandise a bit high. Despite that I'm still going to buy it, and would recommend this anime to anyone.",1376092800,8,804,4.462585034013605

5841271,5,B00DPH7RBU,I really enjoyed this anime. The main male character wasn't annoying but oblivious to the females around him for most of the show.

8595845,5,B00DPH7RBU,"- Synopsis: Our main character is bestowed with the title of Campione. A status that elevates him to a God Slayer. He is tasked with fighting various gods that disrupt the peace and balance of the world.

Not only is he burdened with this troublesome duty, his newly-elevated status has him constantly being showered with adoration from a variety of cute girls. They assist him in defeating these gods, but in order for him to do so, he must be imparted with knowledge. The only problem is that it must be given to him in the form of mouth-to-mouth contact. Tune in to witness the struggles of this young Campione as he battles his way to victory and kisses the lovely ladies.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Most of the anime entails that the main character must make contact via mouth-to-mouth in order to be instilled with knowledge needed to defeat his many foes. It's pretty impressive some of the things that he ends up fighting. Can range from anime characters you might find in God Eater, Monster Musume, Claymore, and so on.

As such, the amount of fan-service is moderately high in this anime. Mainly stimulating kissing scenes, among other things. If that is an issue for some viewers, it would be best to avoid this anime.

- Analysis: Fortunately, the main character realizes that it is imperative to work together to take down his many foes. As social interactions are strong in this anime, this possibly infers to the fact that life heavily revolves around the relationships of others, regardless of their perceived significance. What cannot be done alone; might be possible when working together.

Though the protagonist is plenty strong thanks to his elevated status, it was a nice detail that required him to find out the weakness of his enemies. Similar to the circumstances in the Fate anime series. After all, the enemies he deals with aren't small-fries that can be beaten with sheer force or will-power.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 13 episodes on 2 Blu-rays with a run-time of about 5 hours. This anime is rated TV-MA due to violence and moderate sexual content.
