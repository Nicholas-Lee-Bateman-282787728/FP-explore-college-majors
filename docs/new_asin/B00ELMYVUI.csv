5927549,5,B00ELMYVUI,"I have been following  Jared for over two years now and I have watched every videos he made from the first one up to now.
After watching all that great free info he gave out, buying this was the least I could do!

This  guide is jam pack with  knowledge and pure photo passion!

This is like getting a 1 on 1 with Jared. Even if I am past the beginner stage, I found excellent info with the photoshoot portion
and the bonus 5 year plan video. Will make a great gift to any photographer out there! It was 100% worth it!",1378166400,4,518,4.03921568627451
5927550,5,B00ELMYVUI,People ask me how Iearned photography....THIS is how.,1378166400,3,53,5.75
5927551,5,B00ELMYVUI,"There is a lot of Photography information out there. Some good, some bad. Jared Polin has some of the best. He teaches in a way that is fun and easily understandable. I have purchased the guide, I thought I would learn a few things. I learned a lot of things. If you just picked up your first camera or have been shooting for years I can't say enough about Jared, his guide, website and YouTube channel.",1378166400,4,403,4.315789473684211
5927552,5,B00ELMYVUI,great info with not to much confusing technical mumbo jumbo. I have learned allot from this guide and don't use anything but manual now. Another guide with the technical mumbo jumbo would a great addition though.,1451088000,,212,4.916666666666667
5927553,5,B00ELMYVUI,"This video guide took me from knowing very little about iso settings, shutter speed and aperture to shooting in manual mode with my dslr. I am getting very good results and would recommend watching his videos on YouTube and any video that he has for sale.",1449014400,,255,4.565217391304348
5927554,5,B00ELMYVUI,"I bought this guide directly from Jared ""FroKnowsPhoto"" Polin shortly after it came out.  I'm an experienced photographer myself, but I wanted something fun and thorough to help teach my then 14 year old daughter how to use a DSLR.  I gave her my old backup Nikon D300s and within a day of watching it she was off and shooting comfortably in full manual mode with a solid understanding of what she was doing at the controls.  Since then, I've bought Jared's lighting guide as a gift to a fellow photographer friend, and his DSLR Video guide to help grasp some of the skills I needed to tackle the requests for video I was receiving from some of my commercial clients.  All have been fun and informative, and well worth the price.",1448928000,2,729,4.5
5927555,5,B00ELMYVUI,I've been watching Fro for years. He breaks things down and really helps you understand.,1448928000,,88,4.933333333333334
5927556,5,B00ELMYVUI,Fro does a great job explaining the begging to photography anything you need to know is in this guide please watch it! It is a great way to get into photography,1448928000,,160,4.193548387096774
5927557,5,B00ELMYVUI,Jared really sums it up well with this guide. Sure you can find the information for free online but here it's nicely organized and easy to follow. He has a great way of teaching and inspiring. If you are having trouble learning on your own I personally know that this guide can help you as it did myself.,1448928000,,304,4.258620689655173
5927558,5,B00ELMYVUI,"I 1st came across Fro's YouTube videos, all I saw was a guy with OCD and a sniffing fetish LOL But I needed a guid to getting out of the auto setting on my D3200! Jared's video guide helps a lot and I keep watching it as reference to what I'm learning. I now understand auto!",1448841600,,275,3.9285714285714284
5927559,2,B00ELMYVUI,"This is only a beginner guide if you got your first DSRL. Very, very basic. I would recommend Joel S. as he will cover the basics and much more that you will be using if you get into photography.",1399334400,2,195,4.0256410256410255
5927560,5,B00ELMYVUI,"LOVE this. Finally things make sense when it comes to photography! I could read and re-read books, but I felt like I never ""got it"" when it came to putting it into use. Jared does such a fantastic job of making it simple for anyone to understand. I would definitely recommend this video and purchase any furture guides he makes.",1396828800,3,328,4.483333333333333
5927561,5,B00ELMYVUI,This dvd is very easy to fallow and understand. Really helpful for the beginner photographer. I highly recomen this dvd for any photographer.,1396656000,2,141,5.173913043478261
5927562,5,B00ELMYVUI,"I was always shooting my pictures on Auto and had no clue what to do when it came to the other modes on my Canon 7D.  I found Jarod's site while looking for information on photography and video with DSLRs and liked what I read.  I decided to purchase his DVD via digital download and watched it.  Almost instantly I felt confident that I could learn how to properly setup a shot and set the ISO, Shutter Speed and exposure levels.  Jarod stresses that you need to practice, so that is what I did.  I took pictures of everything and anything over a two day period and looking back on the pics I could tell that I was improving dramatically from shot to shot.

It has been about 2 weeks now and although I am not a professional photographer, the information I learned from this DVD has given me the confidence to stay on M and going back to auto just doesn't feel right anymore.  Thanks Jarod for putting this information together in a way anyone can understand.  One more thing, I only shoot RAW now!  Booyah!",1378252800,6,1008,4.347593582887701
5927563,5,B00ELMYVUI,Jared goes out of his way to explain how to use your cameras settings by showing you examples of what each setting does. This is much easier than reading about it as you can instantly see the difference each setting makes. If you are wanting to learn photography this is where you should start.,1378252800,,294,4.462962962962963
5927564,5,B00ELMYVUI,"I used this as my guide when I first took the plunge into DSLR photography. It was by far the best way to go. I had a lot of questions and knew very little about exposure or composition, this put everything in perspective in a very easy to understand format, no need for long or boring books and manuals. After watching it the first time I actually felt comfortable starting to work in manual and experiment with my new camera. There is no better way to learn something than in real world examples and demonstrations and that is all here in the DVD. I have gladly encouraged family and friends wanting to step up their photography skills to get started right here with the DVD, Jared Polin did a great job on this one getting beginners on the fast track to great photography!",1378166400,2,775,4.426573426573427
5927565,5,B00ELMYVUI,"Have a DSLR? Having a hard time understanding the in's and out's of exposure settings?  Jared Polin has a way of explaining things like Exposure, ISO, depth of field, etc so it is easy to understand and very reasonably priced. Doesn't mater the brand of camera you have (Nikon, Canon, etc) This is an easy to follow instructional DVD you can watch over and over again at your own pace. I still refer to mine from time to time for refreshers. Know someone with a DSLR? Makes a great gift!  Check this out today.  Jared is the Dave Ramsey of photography.

5927566,5,B00ELMYVUI,I bought this guide already knowing a little of the basics.  This helped put certain things into perspective and helped with those little questions you sometimes feel too stupid to ask.  Plus it was great having each part of the exposure triangle broken down so you can see exactly what each piece of the triangle does.  I highly recommend this to anyone starting out or anyone that just wants to advance their photo taking abilities.,1378166400,,434,4.76
5927567,5,B00ELMYVUI,"Learning the technical information of the camera is incredibly difficult.  Jared Polin really has the knack for breaking the difficult to understand material down into easy to understand laymen's terms.  He does it with charisma, charm and just a little funk.  I always refer new photographers to his website and blog.  I always start out with... though he may look and act differently but you leave the experience much more knowledgeable.  Well worth the buy!!",1378166400,,461,5.093333333333334
5927568,5,B00ELMYVUI,"If you just purchased an SLR camera or got one as a gift, and know nothing about photography, just buy this video guide and never look back. After watching it a couple of times with your camera in hand, the essentials of photography will just become second nature to you. And I really do mean a couple, as in two (of course, you'll want to watch it more times). You will quickly come to even dread the limitations of what before you thought as the difficult ""advanced"" modes of your camera (aperture or shutter speed priority) and just want to stay in manual. Camera demystified! I have read comprehensive guides about aperture, shutter speed, and ISO and I'm often put off by the overly technical language. Jared explains enough technical stuff to make you understand and then immediately takes you to practice. The only way I can describe it is that you'll just ""get it"". The bonus material takes you along with Jared on (plausible-for-beginners) photo shoots, which is extremely helpful.",1378166400,,990,4.795321637426901
5927569,5,B00ELMYVUI,"Now the title of my comment may sound rather a$$-kissy but this is serious. Ive been taught through my 5 years of photography my many people but this guide completely turned the tables for me. And I thought I knew manual! Now, before I watched this I knew quite a bit of photography but Jared showed me that there is a hell lot more to learn! The guide wasn't really useful for me until after the 40 minute marker, that's when, for me,tons of great need-to-know info...or should i say..infro? (yeah, you're right, i shouldn't). I knew a lot of this stuff already but Jared really paved the pot holes I had in my knowledge. Especially light metering!
Even after all these years I was taught a lot! I really wish I knew about this before cause man would it speed of the learning process but also in the RIGHT way! Jared doesn't just pile a bunch of info in your face but rather thoroughly covers it, making anyone understand that even my friend that I watched it with (who is not a photographer) understood and thought it was pretty cool! He is also pretty funny and just plain awesome mcawesomeser! I laughed way to hard of what he called the skateboard trick the model did in one of his shoots!
In the end, Im sure if anyone out there decides to buy it, you sure-as-hell won't regret it! Even after around two years of using the manual setting (before the AV), i still got a ridiculous amount of infromation (see what i did there :D yeah, im lame at puns)properly taught!
Thanks Fro, You seriously gave me a new set of tools for the eye and mind when I go photographing

PS: I was completely overcome by excitement after watching his guide, it was that great.",1378166400,2,1659,4.403908794788274
5927570,5,B00ELMYVUI,"Great Stuff !  I've followed him for 3 years now and the information he provides is fantastic.  Bought this last year & couldn't be more pleased.  He breaks down using your first DSLR into simplicity, in a fun & energetic way!  The guy has 2 gifts ... being a photographer and being a teacher.  And he's more than passionate about BOTH!  Would recommend this to EVERYONE who is just starting out (and those who need a refresher) .  Hopefully there will be more from him in the near future!",1378166400,,489,4.426966292134831
5927571,4,B00ELMYVUI,"I have been following Jared's videos on YouTube for awhile. I bought a dslr in May and have been casually shooting and reading books, magazines and web content on how to use it properly. A few weeks ago I decided to invest a little more time an money into learning about my new passion; the FroKnows guide has taught me more in 3 hours than months of reading.  Jared breaks down the basics into simple to understand sections that teach and entertain. You can really tell he is passionate about what he is telling us. The exposure triangle makes a lot more sense to me now an I feel equipped to take some good photos. My girlfriend noticed a jump in my picture quality immediately.",1378166400,8,680,4.44
8606708,5,B00ELMYVUI,I love it. Fro breaks it down so easily. I've already taken some photography classes before but this was a great refresher course.,1489536000,,130,4.695652173913044
8606709,5,B00ELMYVUI,Great guide for beginners.,1482624000,,26,5.75
8606710,5,B00ELMYVUI,"I am a fan of anything froknowsphoto happy with my purchase, as described no damage.",1474675200,,84,4.666666666666667
8606711,5,B00ELMYVUI,"Fun, informative, and lively (just like Jared's You Tube videos) presentation that is easy to follow.  Jared keeps it interesting without using a lot of technical talk.  Plenty of good tips and advice in here.",1467849600,,209,4.942857142857143
8606712,5,B00ELMYVUI,"This DVD covered exactly what I thought it would. I have been taking pictures for 45 years and have always been in AUTO. This DVD does a very good job of explaining the various settings and their advantages and disadvantages then showing you with comprehensive examples of each in the field. He has an easy going style of teaching that keeps your attention.
There were a few more advanced topics that are brought up very briefly that he mentioned will be covered later. -they are not, but that was really no big deal.",1463097600,,517,4.56989247311828
8606713,1,B00ELMYVUI,This is so basic. just waste of money i could have watched from you tube instead.,1456358400,,81,4.125
8606714,5,B00ELMYVUI,great package,1451865600,,13,6.0
8606715,5,B00ELMYVUI,thank you! thank you!,1451433600,,21,4.5
8606716,5,B00ELMYVUI,"Jared's instructional style makes it very easy to get hooked quickly and stay focused (see what I did there?) on what he's teaching.  I was forever shooting in Ap Priority mode until I stumbled upon Jared's videos on YouTube, which directed me to his web page (froknowsphoto.com), which convinced me to buy this guide.  Note: I bought it directly from Jared vs from Amazon.  After going through it and the photo shoots that are included with it, I become much less interested in Ap Priority (or *any* priority) and have learned to keep the camera on the big, ol 'M'.

His guides are silly inexpensive, specially with the amount of information he packs into them and the quality in which they're produced (of course, Todd should keep working on that ""Video Guide"", and Stephen should continue practicing keeping things in focus (#blamestephen)).  I can't say enough good things about Jared, his crew, and the products he produces.  This guide is just the tip of the iceberg.",1451174400,2,973,4.831325301204819
8606717,5,B00ELMYVUI,"Fro does know.  This is my Bible.  learned a lot and gave me the confidence to go out and and shoot!  worth buying, you won't regret it.",1451088000,,136,3.962962962962963
