3415600,2,B0018CWVWO,"""Earth: The Biography,"" is an interesting BBC documentary follow up to ""Planet Earth.""  However, shame on the BBC for false advertising.

It's a disgrace that the BBC would put out a 2008 ""Blu-ray release,"" with Blu-ray packaging that falsely claims ""1080i Format"" on ""2 Blu-ray Disc 25"" on the packaging, with two enclosed DVD discs marked with the ""Blu-ray"" Trademark, when what you actually get is a giant rip-off.

You get 2 Standard Definition, 480p discs in the Blu-ray package, that are marked with the Blu-ray Trademark, which are only capable of 480p up conversion to wide screen viewing.  This is NOT High Definition!!!

The BBC even has the nerve to use the same BBC - HD promotional introductory video, as was used in Planet Earth, which falsely suggests that you are actually watching a High Definition video!!

BBC, for all that you do right, your Marketing Department, and whomever else may be responsible for this fraudulent ""Blu-ray"" release of ""Earth: The Biography"", undermines the BBC's credibility and does a disservice to your loyal audience and clients.

The BBC should recall this fraudulent ""Blu-ray"" release of ""Earth: The Biography"" immediately, and continue to only release ""Earth: The Biography"" in Standard Definition.",1217116800,63,1248,5.17910447761194
3415601,5,B0018CWVWO,"Unlike the BBC series ""Planet Earth"", which is a stunning series in itself, ""Earth, the Biography"" shys away from lifeforms on the planet and looks at the Earth herself; in all its glory and complexity.

While I strongly disagree with one reviewer claiming this is proof we are ALONE in the Universe (C'mon, we can barely see into our own galaxy, let alone the billions of other massive galaxies in the Universe!), there is no doubt that our planet is rare amoung celestial bodies. Requiring all the right components to support complex life; like human beings. To believe the Earth was created by some super being is naive at best. This series proves we weren't here before, and we won't be again some day in the future...but Earth will still go on. Ian says, ""forget save the Earth, she will survive, how about save the human race!""

Beautiful to watch, deeply interesting and thought provoking, and slightly frightening with it's dire warnings of global warming, I highly recommend this series to all who love our planet.",1217030400,5,1023,4.806818181818182
3415602,5,B0018CWVWO,"With vivid, well-composed landscapes and animal shots popping up at least once a minute, this documentary series looks great in Blu-Ray. Even many of the basic shots are really well lit. The CGI effects are cool, too.

Is it as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth?</a>&nbsp;No. These shows are not a nonstop visual extravaganza. But don't let that dissuade you. If it wasn't for ""Planet Earth"" everyone would be raving about this set. Because though the screen sometimes shows just a guy or two talking in front of a washed out sky, overall ""Earth: The Biography"" is just as interesting and at times even more informative. And like I said, though it's not all eye candy, there is plenty of it.

These are the same shows that recently aired on the National Geographic Channel. There are no bonus features.

Disc 1 has three shows, ""Volcanoes,"" ""Atmosphere"" and ""Ice."" Disc 2 adds ""Oceans"" and ""Rare Earth."" Each of the first four explains how that particular system works, as well as what happens when it's messed with.

The last show examines a theory that says simple life may actually be common on other planets, but complex life -- i.e., animal life -- requires such a complex sequence of events that we'll never find another human-like population. It goes on to examine how humans are damaging the planet. Did you know each year people cut down enough forest to cover the state of South Carolina?

Everything is presented with plenty of objective, scientific information.

My favorite show is the first one, since it includes the formation of Earth. Did you know scientists think our planet once had a twin? Or that the moon is drifting away from us?

Though the narrator, Dr. Iain Stewart, speaks in a Scottish brogue, I didn't have any trouble understanding him. He's calm and articulate.

By the way, you can't help but be reminded of ""Planet Earth"" as you watch this. A commercial for it is actually the first thing that comes up when you pop in Disc 1.

Besides ""Planet Earth,"" I'd recommend pairing this up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Inconvenient-Truth/dp/B000ICL3KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Inconvenient Truth</a>.

3415604,5,B0018CWVWO,"I thought I had a decent science education until I saw this spectacular, mind-expanding series.  But no.  I sat on the couch and watched all five hours of this brilliant presentation and felt I had been robbed in college.  The stuff on vulcanology and atmospheric science alone makes this show worth having, but the theories about 'Rare Earth' at the end make it even more special.  The photography and recreations are amazing [National Geographic should win some sort of award from the high-def people] and the host is charming.  Even middle-school kids will drop their jaws at some of the footage and photography in this show.  I have bought at least a half-dozen DVDs for people who need a little science in their lives.  Mega-bril!",1216771200,38,735,4.832
3415605,5,B0018CWVWO,"Dr. Iain Stewart is the geologist who hosted HOT ROCKS, another excellent series run on tv. This review is written before the DVDs are released, so it's about the show which is premiering right now on DiscoveryHD. I am assuming there's no difference, or if there is more, it will only improve the experience.

The shows are broken down very well into five categories - 1: Volcano 2: Atmosphere 3: Ice 4: Oceans 5: Rare Earth. Each segment goes into detail about that system and how it affects the planet. Presenting a ""biography"" of the earth is a daunting undertaking, but Stewart goes at it with enthusiasm and does a rather good job, at that! The special effects are very well done, and the imagery is exquisite. Stewart's style is exuberant, he's someone who loves what he's talking about and wants to share it with you. He presumes nothing and explains what he's showing you very well.

Stewart takes pains to show you HOW these systems work and then WHAT changes can cause. For example, he is very honest in his statements about global warming - he informs you WHY scientists are predicting rising seas, etc., tells you how they've come to these conclusions, and how new discoveries are modifying our knowledge.

But please don't think that because he discusses it, that it is the dominant theme - he does NOT spend a ton of time on global warming - most of the shows are simply excellent explanations of the topic system. The conclusions are natural progressions of the information presented, and the shows would be remiss if they did not address them.

I have not seen the final segment but as I've watched the four (and the excellent HotRocks series repeatedly), I feel confident that the last will be equal to it in quality. Should I be wrong, I'll update this tomorrow!

Minor complaints - Although delightful to hear, Stewart's Scots brogue requires close attention at times (at least for Americans), sometimes theorizing about what he must have said, and this can be a little distracting. (Pause and Rewind are great features!!) However, his verbal clarity is actually much improved over his more rapid speech on the Hot Rocks shows, and the information and his engaging presentation are well worth this small additional effort.

And... well... I =THINK= that the shots supposedly depicting oxygen rising from the sea were of methane bubbling up from stagnant seas - the point was to show bubbles rising but they should have removed the telltale debris bottom from the shots.  I am giving it five stars, BUT if there was a choice of 4.75, that would be better, because of these two minor points.

I'm ordering the set now and know it will be watched again and again.  It's just beautiful.",1216080000,13,2701,4.754273504273504

3415631,5,B0018CWVWO,"I like most BBC nature documentaries, and this was no exception.  I had vague doubts about this one before watching it.  It was surprisingly good.  The narrator explores (even in person at some risk to his life) a number of major geophysical processes:  the atmosphere, glaciers, volcanoes, caves, ocean currents, forests, tectonic plates, and even the moon.  He describes the interconnections between these major processes, and how they affect our global climate.  Some work to keep the Earth cooler, while others serve to warm the planet.  He documents how dependent life on Earth is on the efficient balancing of these major processes.  For most of the chapters of this two disk set, the environmental conservation statement is more implied.  The last chapter is devoted to discussing the dangers of global warming, and how our very existence as a species may be at risk if climate change gets out of control.  According to Stewart, if that happens, and a substantial proportion of other living species that we depend on for our own existence perish, so may we perish.  I learned a lot more about Earth from this documentary than I imagined I would, with numerous ""take-aways"".  My favorite take-away was the discovery by scientists that our Moon is gradually moving farther away from Earth.  No need to worry now, for that will take millions of years.  But eventually, if the moon drifts away into an independent orbit around the sun, ocean tides and even the movement of tectonic plates may be impacted.  His strong Scottish accent took a bit of getting used to, but that was a minor thing.  Stewart did an outstanding job.",1457481600,3,1628,4.908424908424909

I know a good bit about geology due to my profession and I believe that documentaries such as this can be valuable to open young minds to, and spark interest in, the earth sciences.  There are many good jobs in the world for those with certain earth science degrees, such as geology, and the forecast is for that to continue.

3415727,5,B0018CWVWO,"This BBC series originally shown on the National Geographic Channel differs from the better known series Planet Earth in that the latter is more about the diversity of life on earth and how species are co-dependent and depend upon their environment.  Earth The Biography tells how the earth formed and devotes chapters to the roles of volcanoes, atmosphere, ice, oceans and how together they created a rare planet. As host Dr. Stewart takes all over the World to witness formations and phenomena only geological professionals know.  We see satellite images of meteor sites, enter an active a volcano, learn that the moon is gradually distancing itself from the earth.  We see video of a test pilot who jumped from a balloon some 60 miles into the edge of space and free falled 15 minutes reaching speeds over 600 miles per hour. We learn that without volcanoes there might not be life on earth.  There was a time 230 Million years ago when the sun was 30% cooler that the earth was covered with snow and ice.  These are just a few of the fascinating life events in earth's history.

Even though I knew most of what was going to be talked about, I couldn't stop watching the beautifully photographed episodes. So overall, I'd recommend this one before the History's series, but if you love this then be sure to check that out.  Also expect to see more stuff about Global Warming in this than in the US based show (from my trip to London it seems global warming is much more talked about there by just about everyone).

Dr Stewart explained things fairly well, and the shots of the volcanoes, etc., were interesting.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Earth History.

Cons:
  Dr Iain Stewart himself. He is no where near the level of a presenter like David Attenborough, and he came across to me as a simpleton at times.

There are five episodes: VOLCANOES, ICE, ATMOSPHERE, OCEANS & THE UNIQUENESS OF PLANET EARTH THAT ALLOWS FOR LIFE. If you're really into science there may not be any revelations here but at the very least this is a reminder of the incredible planet that we inhabit and the amazing way that it sustains itself and how unique and precise everything has to be to sustain life. Being a typical non-scientist, I can say there were things that I learned, especially about how important volcanoes are to sustaining life and how the atmosphere works. It also reinforces the mysteries that surround the origins of and life on planet earth. The BBC, in my opinion, has no peers in producing documentaries about nature.

No other documentary that I have found is as visually magnificent or well-documented as Planet Earth.  However, Earth: The Biography is a well-made film in its own right and provides a nice complement to the Planet Earth series.  This title focuses more on Earth's design and make-up rather than the life that inhabits it, as Planet Earth (PE) does.

My favorite part of this movie was the section on volcanoes, there is some really outstanding footage including eruptions and time-lapsed photography of how Mt. St. Helens may be preparing to erupt again.

With that said, my opinion is that the 1080i vs. 1080p is definitely NOT a reason to refrain from buying this Blu-Ray.  Lovers of P.E. will appreciate the excellent graphics and camera-work displayed in Earth: The Biography (ETB).

Yes, some of the documentary is speculation, as in events that may have occurred millions of years ago.  These events are dramatized with CG or in an array of distinct camera shots.  I felt that these scenes help the viewer to imagine what conditions or catastrophes may have looked like, and the fallout they may have caused.

My recent purchase of a Sony Bravia 46"" W4500 Series BRAVIA, the Blu-ray version now plays at 1080/24p.

Original review:

In the beginning there was Planet Earth.. now there is Earth: The Biography. As a child I grew up being immersed in the physical geography and the birth of the earth.

Beautifully described via CG on plate tectonics and volcanoes, the destructive power of ice and water, and the vital importance of the the atmosphere.

For those that have watched the Life of Series by David Attenborough, will notice repeated footage those series, as well as repeated footage from Planet Earth, and Ganges.

Despite the various comments that this is a standard definition presentation by BBC, when I play it on my PS3, I am getting 1080i and not 420p, as some have remarked.  Not true 1080p, but nonetheless stunning.

Great addition to my collection of BBC and Nat Geo documentaries.",1226620800,9,916,4.864516129032258

It was if the BBC had subcontracted the task out, and the film makers took short cuts on the quality. The host is also a little annoying I feel. He comes across as if he's over doing it a bit.

So even though it was very educational, with the message not to worry, once we're all dead the Earth will still be here, I was not totally entertained in the manner previous shows had. So three stars.

It will have you believe that ALL scientists agree that this was the way it all happened, but it gives you absolutely no clue that the scientific community is completely split.

3415871,5,B0018CWVWO,"Dr. Stewart's latest contribution to science for the non-scientist continues his refreshing perspectives on the planet earth. If this video does not educate, enthrall, and entice you to learn more about our planet and its fragility, you must be one of those people who will not allow themselves to be confused with facts because your mind is already made up.

Once you get used to Dr. Stewart's Scots accent, his explanations of natural phenomena are remarkable for their clarity and simplicity. Even so, he does not condescend as he shares his wonderment at the most recent scientific discoveries that he presents in ways that compel the viewer to pay attention.

While some may contend that his topic includes ""controversial"" issues such as global warming, he never makes a statement without offering solid evidence.  Indeed, his discussions are replete with references to the scientific recognition that they are theories that continue to evolve as evidence is accumulated.  Thus, the only ""controversy"" would arise from the fact that the accumulating evidence tends to support scientific concerns.

For example, the evidence is uncontrovertible that Greenland's glaciers are melting at a rate never observed in modern times.  Even so, Dr. Stewart includes the observation that scientists can only theorize about the consequences because they are unable to follow the melt water through the glacier and under the ice.  Hence, scientists continue to explore and ask questions and postulate new theories ... because that is what good scientists do and that is what good science requires.

Anyone think that there is no problem if the frozen tundra warms up? Watch Dr. Stewart singe his eyebrows as he shows that the white stuff under the moss is methane by igniting it. So, how much methane would be released if (or when) the tundra warms up? And what will be the effect of this greenhouse gas?  Watch the video.

Regardless of your political views on global conditions, this presentation offers the serious questioner the most recent research available. It could cause you to change your mind -- or, like a good scientist -- it could inspire you to find contrary evidence so that an informed dialogue will help us solve our planet's problems.

Last, but not least, so many interesting facts, theories, and supporting evidence are demonstrated that I was amazed at the organizational skills required to present so much information in only two DVD's. I include this video in my five-star list of videos that includes, among others, Blue Planet, Life on Earth, ... and Dr. Stewart's ""Weather"" -- which I also highly recommend.",1220745600,9,2625,5.109813084112149

I found the BBC version ""Earth: The Biography"" to be far more useful on a broader scale, packing an enormous amount of information and understanding into only 4 main episodes, and finally the amazing ""Rare Planet"" finale. I have a background in Biology & Genetics, but I would recommend this series to anyone- layperson or scientist. It is in-depth enough to satisfy my questioning nature, while clear and succinct enough for my 10 year old and totally non-science daughter to understand!

If you want an understanding about ""the big picture"" about the dynamics of our planet, then this is the right series. I feel that ""Planet Earth"" is more for those who would appreciate a huge in-depth episode about each little thing- a whole episode dedicated just to caves! For a broad understanding in far less time though, ""Earth: The Biography"" is the way to go.

""Earth"" goes a bit further than geology by putting each of the presented forces into an affective context. Our biosphere is more integrated and dependent than most people realize.

None of the documentaries produced should be taken as THE authority on any subject. Whatever National Geographic would like to TELL me I should believe Is not what will evolve into the truth for me. I will decide that for myself. Considering my philosophy on assimilating this or other information I think some folks were a bit hard on this series. It is what it is and if I want more information I will find it. These types of programs are meant to be educational ENTERTAINMENT. Thought provoking without covering every possible detail. As educational entertainment this show has done a wonderful job of explaining the processes of the earth and how they relate to everything around us including our own existence. This program is worth the $20 I paid for it and this series is well worth sitting down with your kids to watch. Programs like this can only spark more curiosity and imagination. More than the actual facts and figures which can be researched at anytime I think programs like this serve to keep our curiosity and imagination moving and our brains thinking.

3415900,1,B0018CWVWO,"I and wife are NG ""fans"", contributors and subscribers (also TRAVELER), but this time I was very disappointed... That is to say, they've ""gone too far"". Let me try to explain. (By the way we have the full DVD set, which consists of 5 programs of approximately :45 in length.) I very much enjoyed the videography, and even the host, but the program compromises what it purports to do, which is, trace the history and significance of various elements of life on earth, with some very dubious science. Let me give you an example, but in order to understand the example you must understand that every episode of the program is permeated with stern warnings, flash-forward images, etc. regarding anthropogenic global warming. (I chuckle to remember that In THE OCEANS the host, referring to a quite debatable and theoretical link between CO2 absorption and acidity levels in certain parts of the ocean, and for some reason also referring to an isolated local jellyfish kill in the south pacific [which he admits was due to natural weather fluctuations] actually exclaims: ""We're pumping out so much CO2 that the oceans just can't keep up.."" [This statement vis a vis acidity alone is a VERY hefty amalgam of dubious science.])In any case, the example I WANTED to give, was the main thrust of The Oceans: that because of global warming, the conveyor current is likely to ""shut down"" just as it did 250 million years ago when same shut-down caused the Permian extinction. I thought this was infuriating, as there remains GREAT debate over the cause of the PT Extinction and warming / conveyor shutdown doesn't even make the top three most likely reasons. So - I could go on and on but, in a nutshell, great pictures, bad science. It's one thing to scare people in order to get them on the climate-crisis bus, it's quite another thing to ""stretch,"" oversimplify and misrepresent very good standing research and fascinating science to fit a programming agenda. Tracing back 40 years or so, NG is on the whole giving its readers and viewers fewer and fewer facts, fewer and fewer tidbits of real information, and more and more ""death befalls the planet"" speeches while violins play underneath. Oh well. It's effective at generating ""maximum emergency contributions"" from most people, I'm sure. And... I still love the pictures!",1218326400,25,2317,4.89821882951654
3415901,5,B0018CWVWO,"'Earth - The Biography' is a documentary about Earth's geology, atmosphere, and oceans.
It provides a short overview of how our planet was created but its main focus is on how Earth's natural forces combine to create conditions for life - and how this makes Earth a unique place in the Solar system and 'perhaps in the universe'.

It's a very high quality documentary that is on the same level as 'Planet Earth' and 'Blue Planet' - with great footage and visions of earth.
The guy with the accent is actually very charming, watchable, and non-obtrusive. I'm a non-native speaker and had no problems understanding what he was saying. Besides, there are subtitles.

I only regret that they did not put any special features on the DVD. After watching all five episodes, I really wanted to see a little more.",1217980800,10,804,4.735714285714286
3415902,1,B0018CWVWO,"The Blue-Ray box that ""Earth: The Biography"" came in says the format is 1080i, not 1080p.

Every BBC Blue-Ray and HD disk I have previously ordered has been 1080p. I also ordered ""Wild China"" in Blue-Ray at the same time and it is also labeled 1080i.

It gets worse if you read the comments from ""The Blue Ray Expert"".",1217980800,8,318,4.372881355932203
3415903,3,B0018CWVWO,"The science is solid.  But Dr. Stewart's articulation is too much for American ears. The way he narrates is annoying...he like to curl his tongue on words that doesn't require it, ie.'erhly  Earth' (early Earth) and 'mellion of years'(million of years),  It's not exactly British accent (which is okay), Other reviewers says Scottish - whatever it is, it turns what could have been a five-star product to a middling three.  Take some getting use to (the narration's tone) but is very annoying the first hour or two... What saves is is content, as usual, BBC shines.

If your DVD Player can play Region 2 (PAL) discs, BBC has produced a series with a similar scope - 'Earth Story' from 1998.  I found that superior to this one.  Available from Amazon.co.uk.  Not available on Region 1 though.",1217462400,4,791,4.764705882352941
3415904,1,B0018CWVWO,"im sorry but if you're gonna have someone narrate a show, get someone that doesnt have a heavy british/scottish/irish/ accent. i know this was a bbc production but it shouldve been renarrated by someone else before going on sale in the United States. I watched maybe 15 minutes of it having to strain to understand the narrator  which is something the viewer should not have to do. finally i turned the volume all the way down and just watched the nature scenes. 10 minutes later i got up and left the room.havent gone back and i won't miss any sleep over it. I spent $25 on this movie which was a complete waste. Do yourself a favor and find something else to spend your money on.",1217289600,4,681,4.404761904761905
8269497,3,B0018CWVWO,"I was disappointed in these DVDs.  In the first place, the subject matter is inherently less interesting than living things are.  Beyond that, I found the narrator tiresome.  He always wants to dramatize things; he puts a lot of excitement into his voice, as if he were reading a childrens book to children.  Like Carl Sagan, he overuses and wears out such words as astonishing, breathtaking, and so on.  Some of his statements are at best debatable and it worst simply wrong.  I was also annoyed by his thick accent.  Lets stay with David Attenborough.",1520640000,,553,4.757894736842105

8269501,2,B0018CWVWO,"Dr. Stewart ruins the viewing experience with his vocal delivery, which over-emphasizes words to the point of distraction. He's trying so hard to emphasize certain syllables that you can hear him blowing air out of his mouth. Really, nobody talks that way. If David Attenborough had been the program host, we would have a 5-star viewing experience.",1496361600,,348,5.12280701754386
