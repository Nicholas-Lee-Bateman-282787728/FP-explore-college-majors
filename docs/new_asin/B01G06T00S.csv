Failed to congratulate the so so so many African Americans who have rose up against all odds within the last 50-100 years . People like Obama people like Jim brown people like athletes and performers. It's reverse racism with a negative context from start to finish . Conspiracy theorist and role models stoke the flames of separation. They actually have the balks to say nothing has changed since the 20's . A two term president says different. I am saddened to think I watched this whole thing to learn with An open mind . And yes I am going to be abused by my honest reflection because someone like me with less pigment shouldn't have an opinionif it's not glowingly a positive one, like I read in these comments . What's shameful is they used the term white supremacist in the whole documentary until the end when they start to say just ""whites"" what they really feel .  In the end they start to say just whites and not a small specific group white supremacists as they stay firm for almost the whole movie .  I guessed the director rushed and forgot to cut out or do retakes to say white supremacist . That is just racism at its ugliest and that fact that no one pointed this out in all these comment is very sad because I personally think African Americans is the soul of this country and our communities.

I saw the trailer and just had shivers down my spine until I actually watched it. Editing was subpar, some of the individuals that were interviewed were individuals I had never heard off before in my life. There were aspects of the subject matter that were discussed in the wrong chapter of the film. Just all around a let down. That being said, I liked the part about the solutions.

7753015,5,B01G06T00S,i am very impressed with the research and scholars used to give scholarly insight....,1466467200,,85,5.142857142857143
7753016,4,B01G06T00S,"I almost gave this 3 stars because it was focusing way too much on Egypt (I detest this to no end, we had other great civilizations). It then redeemed itself as it progressed, 3.75 stars. A few things I'd like to mention:

1.) Tariq is too kumbaya for my taste and is excessively repetitive, bruh please find other words to utilize outside of repeating White Supremacy and White Supremacist 50 million times lol. Be careful with people that are promoting films like this but want to still ""include"" non-Blacks that are as he says ""melanated."" All Whites are racist (including their variants...White Hispanics etc) All non-Blacks that have darker complexions are also racist. This is why it's important to stay away from 'people of color', this phrase negates Black people altogether, ostensibly appearing to include us. Stop EQUATING our experiences with people who do not and have not been through what we go through and who are PART of the continued OPPRESSIVENESS of African people globally. #knowyourenemy
 I have all four of the dvds. These series are good primers. I liked Robin Walker's information a lot. Enjoyed the information about the Royale Battles.

2.) Dealing with Churches and Separatism. It is very important that we understand that it is ok as Blacks (Israelites...African people, Diaspora and Africa), that it is ok to have our own churches. We have different needs, different experiences and different cultures and wanting to be around your own people is natural. Multiculturalism KILLS Black empowerment and Black culture(s).

3.) Lincoln did not free our enslaved ancestors, that is all in that regard. WE DID, read up more on how the civil war was more of a formality. They couldn't handle all the resistance.

4.) As Israelites it's important we understand the history of the CONTENT of the bible and where it actually comes from (not Egypt). We're an ORAL people, many of the events/stories were orally passed down. Laws were given to follow (again ORAL). Much of the bible = recorded events, prophecy etc. There is much I could add here, but I am too tired, just research the information. I'd recommend reading the apocrypha. My views vary from the traditional Black person that consider themselves ""Christian."" Please look up that word...it's derogatory and YAH was NOT Christian. Family, we've been given slave doctrine utilized to maintain our subjugation and place us in a submissive state that keeps us stagnant, and not truly fighting White Domination of our people globally.  I will also recommend folks to look up WATCHMAN on youtube and look up a few books on here that deal with US being the true people.

5.) I'd like to see more referenced material in the videos, maybe that can be added to the site at some point.

6.) Irish, the Fake ""Jews"", White Greeks etc were always considered White, they just weren't regarded as high ranking Whites, like ""Anglo-Saxons aka Germanic tribes"", there was no conversion to Whiteness; they just moved up in rank within the White hierarchy of properness lol. And yes some of them have mixed ancestry to an extent because of the Black rulership + our enslavement. Stop giving these people excuses though!

Overall good. While not a fan of Tariq from a personal standpoint, I can get behind the series as he's waking up our folks who may not know this information (just make sure you critique info). Now, all we have to do is continue to wake up and realize who we truly are.

sorry y'all I forgot the book recommendations lol:
Blessing of Africa
Hebrewisms of West Africa
Africans who wrote the bible (please be careful...linguistics only)
Traditions and Customs of Gadangmes of Ghana: Descendants of Authentic Biblical Hebrew Israelites
The Ancient Black Hebrews and Arabs

As you find these on Amazon, you'll see other recommendations.

7753043,5,B01G06T00S,"Tariq Nasheeds hidden colors documentary series is second to none. Hidden colors 4 goes for the jugular of white supremacy.there has been  countless documentaries but none that delves directly into the arc of systematic white supremacy. White supremacy is the problem that plagues the globe and hidden colors exposes that unapologetically. This documentary series needs to be in schools homes and other institutions to educate malinated people about themselves. This documentary hits home when it comes to black empowerment and black unity. I urge all my black brothers and sisters to buy this documentary and support the cause of black empowerment. I will continue to watch this DVD over and over again. If we do not know our history then we do not know ourselves. 20 stars !!!!!!

I recommend this movie to all people of African descent, to know your history, not the one that gives you the narrative of a white savior. This movie provides a starting point to understand what you are facing not only in western nations, but even in our beloved Africa, where people perceive that black countries are failing inherently, without understanding the effects of colonization. Praises and blessings to the different scholars of all age groups and backgrounds for contributing a wealth of research and life studies to make this film, I can only imagine the many friends that have isolated you and universities who fail to disseminate the information to the people who need it most, which are our children.
