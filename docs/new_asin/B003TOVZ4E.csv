8405348,5,B003TOVZ4E,R Valentino was one of the greatest and handsomest men/actors I have ever seen. He died way to young. He steals the scenes from everyone around him. I can't understand why the director of this movie Rex Ingrahm and his co-star Terry Alice who was married to the director had such a strange dislike for Rudolph. I believe Mr Ingrahm was very jealous and envious of Rudy but Ms Alice hatred for Rudy is a mystery to me...Unless it was because of how her husband felt.,1355011200,,465,4.4186046511627906
8405349,4,B003TOVZ4E,"It was a very pleasant surprise to watch this almost forgotten and overlooked silent film featuring the silent screen legend, Rudolph Valentino, and another bright star of the era, Alice Terry.  This is the first DVD by Lostflix I have seen, and expected only an average B-grade movie, but The Conquering Power is much more than that.  Not only does it have an impressive cast, but the director is Rex Ingram, whose best works include the grand WWI saga ""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"", (1921) which catapulted Valentino to fame; ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1922) and ""Scaramouche""(1923), both with Alice Terry and other prominent silent era stars.
As a result, ""The Conquering Power"" is a cut above the average movie of this period, with attention to costumes, sets and other details while telling a powerful story of human emotions and characters.  In fact, the underlying message of human struggle and fortunes is more dramatic and poignant than expected.  Based on the novel Eugenie Grandet by influential French author Honore de Balzac, it tells the story of two related families with very different ways of dealing with their wealth.
The main character, Eugenie, is played by Alice Terry, and her co-star, Valentino, is her cousin who had never met her until his father sent him to his estranged brother, Eugenie's father.  A romance develops which the father attempts to sabotage, but after a long period of heartache and lost hope, the all-conquering power - love - wins out in the end.  In the process, the main characters undergo changes that refine and bring out either the best or worst in each of them.
This DVD version is obviously a copy from a VHS, but apart from the images not being as sharp and clear as they could be, the entire film is in top condition.  The accompanying music is a standard organ score.  Anyone expecting a glamorous or charismatic performance by Valentino in this film might be disappointed, but for Valentino fans this DVD is definitely a must-have.",1313539200,3,1989,4.881305637982196
