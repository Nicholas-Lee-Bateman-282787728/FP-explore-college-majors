2169864,5,B000667HE0,This was an excellent movie. Very serious and funny and true. I highly recommend this to everyone.,1224460800,,98,4.823529411764706
2169865,5,B000667HE0,Well honestly I got gas because Tyson is on the cover and he's SUPER HOT! Tyson doesn't have a large role in the movie but I ended up enjoying the movie. It's not the best movie but it's decent.  & for the best price you can pick GAS up @ Wal-Mart.,1149465600,,248,3.8627450980392157
2169866,4,B000667HE0,"Chris Powell, the owner of Powell Gas & Market, a unique full service station, passed away.  Chris' presence in the community, although beneficial to so many was usually fruitless for his business.  At least they could be counted as his tickets to heaven.

Damon & Mookie Powell brothers with a prime hate/hate relationship learn that there dearly departed dad amended his will leaving both brothers to work as a team for an entire year.

WHY IS DADDY MAKING US DO THIS?  Both Damon, and Mookie asked.  It was obvious that there was some bad oil fueling the venom between the two.  Each brother was bossy, stubborn, and angry.  Can you expect to turn a profit with them in charge?

Funny when crisis emerge some things simply take priority.  The thought that another love one could be taken, the question isn't who's the boss.  Instead the best becomes reflective.  God is a restorer!

Chris was a visionary.  Just wanting the ultimate for his family & community.  We need more ""BLACK"" businesses that care enough to stand strong in the communities.

I liked it!

2169867,2,B000667HE0,this film had alot of Promise but got caught up in some cliches&preditablity. but the Lady Preacher:Good LAwd that sista was Sho Nuff Fione.if my local Church had a Preacher that looked like that Lady I'd put my whole wallet into the Collection Plate. it was cool seeing the two Brothers coming together for there Mother in the end.,1111276800,3,332,4.6440677966101696
2169868,2,B000667HE0,"THEY COULD HAVE OMITTED THE PROFANITY AND DRUG SCENES..THAT WEREN'T NEEDED, NOT EVEN FOR REALISTIC PURPOSES, THIS COMEDY/DRAMA COULD HAVE BEEN MORE FUNNY, WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE , IF THEY CONCENTRATED ON THE WRITING. THE MOVIE STARS FLEX ALEXANDER AND KHALIL KAIN AS BROTHERS WHO DON'T GET ALONG, BUT INHERIT A GAS STATION AND GO THRU A SERIES OF EVENTS IN ORDER TO KEEP IT. SUPERMODEL TYSON BECKFORD ALSO IS FEATURED IN THE MOVIE PERIODICALLY, SURE HE'S GOOD EYE CANDY FOR THE LADIES,  ALTHOUGH HE'S AMONGST NO DENZEL WASHINGTONS, HE SHOULD CONSIDER ACTING SCHOOL, IF ACTING IS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO DO. LADIES, IF YOU JUST LIKE TO WATCH HANDSOME GUYS PUMP GAS, GO FOR IT! AGAIN THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINING MINUS THE ELEMENTS THAT GAVE IT AN R -RATING, THUS RUINING WHAT COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER.",1109548800,4,816,4.746478873239437
