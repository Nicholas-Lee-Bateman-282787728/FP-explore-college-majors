8219138,5,B000VKM9T4,"I learned so much during Jens' lessons. I've been drumming for 15 years now, and after watching this I through everything I knew previously out the window. Mr. Hannemann is a true inspiration!",1368144000,,192,4.848484848484849
8219139,5,B000VKM9T4,"Freaking hilarious!
If you like Portlandia, you'll love this.
Whether you're a drummer, like drums, have no idea about drums, or even hate drums or drummers, you'll still get a laugh out of this.",1343606400,,195,4.764705882352941
8219140,5,B000VKM9T4,Love this video. We play it at the drum shop all the time. It's amazing how long it takes some people to realize it's not real.,1324857600,5,127,3.923076923076923
8219141,5,B000VKM9T4,"I don't know anything about drumming, but I have heard of this guy somewhere so thought I'd give it a shot - I learned a lot from this video.

I ran into this drummer friend in a club and mentioned that I'm learning 9/21 time signature on the kit drum and he just looked at me with a bewildered expression.

It made me feel pretty good.",1298332800,9,336,4.075757575757576
8219142,2,B000VKM9T4,"If you think someone intentionally playing drums badly is funny or you've watched lots of music training videos then you may find some value in this. Comparisons to Spinal Tap are unjustified. At best this is an Andy Kaufmann-esque attempt at anti-humor with only about a half dozen real jokes, and those just get rehashed again and again throughout the course of the brief 28 minute run time. As a concept, I'm glad someone parodied such a niche media, but knowing it exists is probably more satisfying than the actual product.",1275609600,,528,4.813186813186813
8219143,5,B000VKM9T4,"I wonder if the previous reviewers thought Spinal Tap was a real documentary when it first came out. Musicians with a sense of humor will LOVE this DVD.  Hilarious!  Here is a review of this DVD from Kurt Gottschalk of Signal to Noise magazine:  A different take on art rock (or not) is in the subtly hilarious COMPLICATED DRUMMING TECHNIQUE.  Saturday Night Live's FRED ARMISEN nails the music instruction video as fusoid drummer Jens Hannemann, explaining the intricacies of inane time signatures and hi-hat techniques, complete with crap video effects.  Like THIS IS SPINAL TAP, it doesn't allow being an informed parody to get in the way of its idiocy; it's a hoot!",1213142400,4,669,4.884955752212389
8219144,5,B000VKM9T4,"Hi All,

This is a masterful collection of tips, situations and commentary that are all eseential.  It is without a doubt the MOST innovative drum DVD I've ever seen.  A must have for any drummer who has been in the business for a long time.  The only problem with it is that it's too short!  The DVD is less than 30 minutes!  We need more!",1208995200,5,340,4.153846153846154
8219145,5,B000VKM9T4,"Like Sudoku, Hannemann's technique is easy to learn but hard to master. And like Sudoku, I predict that this DVD will sweep the world by storm. A Gale Force storm. A storm that leaves many victims in its path, but empowers the rest of the community to join together to rebuild in its wake. Then Hannemann can step in and release a charity CD to raise funds, but more importantly ... awareness.

Hanneman is a tremendous instructor and talks to you in a language you'll probably recognize. This is a great DVD for the drumming enthusiast in your life or maybe for that neighbor you've never really gotten to know.",1197072000,11,612,4.5636363636363635
