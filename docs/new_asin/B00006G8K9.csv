7968219,1,B00006G8K9,"I'm a drummer looking to learn how to play guitar and thought that this DVD would be the perfect place to start.

The video started off on the right foot with the first instructor (I forget his name).  He explained things in detail and with a bit of humor which I thought was cool because it offered a relaxed way of learning.  Then he introduced his fellow instructor (I forget his name as well) and it went downhill from there because he took over the instruction.  I felt that he was way too serious and rushed through the lessons considering this is a beginner video.  I also felt that they should have placed the tabs on the screen throughout the lesson because as a beginner it's easy to forget them as you played along.

The two guys' personalities clashed and Mr. Serious often seemed annoyed by his sidekick's presence.  You could feel the tension between them and I waited for them to thrown down the guitars and just beat the hell out of each other.

Had they stuck with instructor #1 I think it may have held my attention a little longer and I would have followed along past the hard rock section.  Thankfully I watched this DVD as a rental and not as a purchase.

These are only my opinions, but I'd look elsewhere for a DVD to teach you the basic beginner stuff.",1134518400,3,1276,4.391489361702128
