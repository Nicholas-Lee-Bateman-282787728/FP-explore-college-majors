8734729,5,B015VJB6WU,"I originally discovered Patty five years ago while searching for sign language videos for my daughter. Her voice is beautiful! Even I loved listening to the same word over and over again. Lol. Then I learned she had Spanish songs and videos. Then I began to expand to all her songs and my daughter would even watch her family touring videos on You Tube, making it feel like she was truly a part of our family. Her music is so diverse and FUN! She's so down-to-earth and not cheesy at all. I mean, as an adult, you really can listen to her music and not be annoyed. We met Patty last summer when she was on tour and my son was only 7 months old. He honestly was a little mesmerized that very first time, but since then, he has taken it up about 20 levels and she is the one thing that can hold his attention span for a long time. He's learning his letter sounds, sign language, Spanish, English vocabulary and I predict so much more! He LOVES music and he absolutely loves Patty! And so does our entire family!",1503187200,,1009,4.260416666666667

8734733,1,B015VJB6WU,Very tired of ordering Patty Shukla DVDs hoping for the great live songs and activities she leads with real children that my son loves on youtube - then getting poorly animated stuff along with her songs with one or 2 live videos.  I need a compilation of her best live stuff and it does not seem to exist.,1472947200,,306,4.275862068965517
8734734,5,B015VJB6WU,"Dancing, singing, lots of action for children.  My grandchildren never get tired of watching It over and over. An artstic and educacional break for parents while kids enjoy this spectacular vdeo.  Highly recommed it!",1472083200,,216,5.323529411764706
8734735,5,B015VJB6WU,"First of all, my kids LOVE Miss Patty, so I knew this would be a hit. :) I purchased this DVD specifically because it had some of my daughter's favorites on there, plus some other songs we hadn't heard yet. Well now they know all the songs, and we watch the DVD daily. Our DVD player even puts it on repeat automatically, so we actually watch it 3-4 times a day. And if the kids are in the other room and I go to turn it off, they get upset and insist I put it back on! Miss Patty's songs are super catchy and educational and great exercise too! My favorite part of the entire DVD is when Patty does the tango with her baby. ",1471219200,,625,4.0
