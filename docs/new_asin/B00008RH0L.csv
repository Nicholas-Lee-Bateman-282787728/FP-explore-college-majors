7986437,3,B00008RH0L,"I usually enjoy the input from Johnny Legend but he makes some serious mistakes throughout the commentary tracks, particularly ""Mondo Freudo"". He chose to watch the film without sound and obviously knew little about what was going on except trying to identify locales. One segment he continues to think is taking place in England and it clearly states it San Fran on the narration. I think it would be wise to at least watch the film prior to doing a commentary and not rely on personal experience and name-dropping. The films are not bad, a little boring in spots but the production credits make them essential cult material. I would have liked to known a bit more about the film segments (what's actually staged and what's real) but the commentators chose to do rambling monologues on personal experiences and neither individuals had anything to do with the films. It's still an interesting package though. Mike Vraney should have listened to the commentary before releasing.",1280620800,4,977,4.963414634146342
7986438,1,B00008RH0L,"If you enjoyed Mondo Cane and are looking for more mondo films, don't get this one!  You may know that Mondo Cane inspired the making of tons of Mondo films.  Unfortunately, it was almost immediately discovered that making fake Mondo films was far easier and was extremely lucrative for the total lack of investment in producing them.

Sadly, if you enjoyed Mondo Cane, once you've also watch the Shocking Asia films and Mondo Magic, there aren't that many other quality Mondo films.

I wasted my money on this worthless dvd and I didn't pay budget prices either.

The first thing you notice, is that while they are supposedly filming people without their knowledge, they are filming with camera movements or angles that are extremely unlikely or near impossible.  Also, they are filming people undressing in stores which would be illegal.  You couldn't do it and later get permission, even if you tried to rationalize that they may have got releases after the fact.

So after realizing I wasted a good amount of money on a totally fake Mondo documentary, I decided to see what the commentary tracks had to say.  Well, they have some experts of some type, explaining where most of the scenes were most likely shot all within the same city although claiming to be filmed all over the world.  Ha! Ha! We have Americans badly trying to pass as Arab sex slave traders!  Ha! Ha!  I think that girl was in another segment!  Look at our fake high tech camera that supposedly is later hidden to film the ""Arabs"".  How did we change camera angles so many times with one hidden camera?

I suppose they were meant to pass as real mondos back in the day, but now they are meant for camp value.

Unfortunately, I am not interested in camp of this type, and I was expecting a real Mondo film when I bought it.  Also, nothing on the dvd cover text suggests that it is a campy fake Mondo.

I should have been familiar with the content before I bought it.  My fault.  But hopefully, if you are looking for more real Mondo films, I can warn you that these are not.

If you think the campiness of silly obviously fake ""Mondo"" films are entertaining, get it.  But don't buy if that is not what you are seeking!",1125705600,11,2190,4.519083969465649
7986439,4,B00008RH0L,"Back in the 60's and 70's MONDO released many of these Shock-U-mentaries...to show us just how different the rest of the world is.
MONDO BIZARRO & MONDO FREUDO were both follow ups to the original ""MONDO CANE"" which first came to theaters in 1964 & 1965.
While Mondo did a great job at completely turning the viewer's stomache and shocking them with scenes of bizarre cult rituals and un-known indian tribes....please be aware that ALL of these great MONDO movies...were 80 percent- FAKE-U-MENTARIES! That's right, most of these documentaries were put out to simply screw with people's heads and make a lot of money. It worked- because most people who went to see Mondo Movies back in the day, believed it was all real! Heck, if Alice Cooper can pull it off on stage....MONDO can pull it off on film.
But, these staged scenes are all part of the fun! It's hilarious to see what they tried to convince audiences back then. Mondo films are not for everyone, but are definitely classics to their own following.",1067212800,9,1007,4.7272727272727275
