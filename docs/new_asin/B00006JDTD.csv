1779547,5,B00006JDTD,"This is a beautiful film that trusts the audience to understand connections between the characters that are not explained in typical narrative and conversational scenes.  Even though I would argue that Moby Dick is the Great American Novel, I felt that Melville's overwrought novella, Billy Budd, was so drearily overwritten that ultimately Melville's meagre psychogical insight evaporated from the overegged prose.  This film does just the opposite: the scenes of the African landscape and the legionaires' bodies are not there for simple aesthetic enjoyment (although they are gorgeously rendered), but are expressionistic land- and body-scapes, the tableaux upon which the story is written.  As such, it's a film that isn't about words (quite the opposite of Melville's dire verbosity in Billy Budd), but about a vocabulary of desire (that transcends, although it also reflects, such categories as colonialism and homosexuality).  The film is Claire Denis' masterpiece to date, the best adaptation of any book I've seen, and has the most beautiful ending of any film I've seen.  I'd keep on writing and gushing hyperbolic about the film, but I think you get the point; it's one of my favourites.",1035763200,14,1198,5.317460317460317
1779548,4,B00006JDTD,"""Beau Travail"" had its US premiere at the New York Film Festival of 1999, followed by a limited release in select cities.  ""Select"" is the keyword here, as ""Beau Travail"" is clearly a film for a specialized audience - dialogue is minimal, and events are indicated rather than dramatized.  But for those willing to take the cinematic leap, Claire Denis has created a film that is breathtakingly visual and unique.
Instead of doing a literal adaptation of Herman Melville's ""Billy Budd,"" Denis uses it as a starting point.  ""Beau Travail"" is a memory piece that takes on the hypnotic quality of a fever dream; Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant), banished from the Foreign Legion and living in present-day Marseilles, looks back on his Legionaire days and the episode that brought about his downfall - his jealousy and persecution of the virtuous, self-sacrificing Sentain (Gregoire Colin).  Stationed in the northeast African nation of Djibouti, a remote area of blue skies, blazing sun, sparkling sea, and barren rock, Galoup and his men live the correct, rigid life of the Legionaire - spotless and well-creased unforms, demanding physical labor, and ritualized exercise and gymnastics.  Except for those evenings when they cut loose at the local disco with their beautiful African girlfriends, they live in a hyper-masculine, male-only domain.  But when Sentain's heroics lead to growing popularity with both his fellow Legionaires and the unit commander, Forestier (Michel Subor), a resentful Galoup embarks on a course of action that leads to his own destruction.  The final scenes of him in a disco - alone, isolated, and spinning out of control - are unforgettable.
Claire Denis, who as a young girl lived near the Foreign Legion base in Djibouti, tells her story with alternating images of stark despair and staggering beauty, and they've been lovingly preserved in this DVD edition.  Film buffs on the lookout for something original should take a glance at ""Beau Travail"" - it's a memorable and rewarding experience.",1035763200,26,2019,5.171779141104294
1779549,4,B00006JDTD,"BEAU TRAVAIL is a curious film.  It is based on the story 'Billy Budd' by Herman Melville and on the operatic adaptation by EM Forster of Benjamin Britten's magnificent BILLY BUDD and has all the right pieces in place to make a fine, updated adaptation of the story.  Unfortunately the script fails to find the message of the story and so there is much correct atmosphere but little character development.
The original story revolves around a warship (The Rights o' Man) in the French and English war that takes on recruits while at sea.  The Captain relates the story of how he was forced to hang the magnificently beautiful and loved new recruit Billy Budd because of an accidental death in part due to Budd's fatal flaw - his stammer.  The Master at Arms notices Billy from the beginning as a creature of physical beauty and there is a strong physical attraction to the lad.  Unable to cope with his feelings, the Master at Arms plots for the downfall of the object of his desire and lust and it is his manipulation that results in Billy's hanging, nearly causing a mutiny by Billy's shipmates.  Billy is a Parsifal character - a 'guileless fool', who even in his sentencing to death still blesses the Captain of the ship.
All well and good.  The film here transplants much of this tale to a Foreign Legion outpost in Africa, and much of the above is insinuated.  The appropriation is so complete that portions of Britten's opera BILLY BUDD are used to set scenes.  But there the magic stops.  The 'master at arms' does not seem to desire the beautiful recruit but for some unexplained reason seeks to have him gone.  Such a shame.  It is as though the writer wanted to avoid homosexual overtones of the original and as a result the characters have no where to go.  All of the actors are good, the scenery is bleak (a desert here instead of the bleak sea of the original)and appropriate, the music is an eclectic mix that works.  All the ingredients are here to make a fine film, but it just doesn't come off.  The director needed to see the old film version of Billy Budd starring Terrence Stamp to see that pitting the evil, sadistic, lusty master at arms against the virile, sensitive and good young man can and does work well.",1034985600,4,2233,4.5475
1779550,3,B00006JDTD,"Although this is a stunning piece of cinematography it is a mediocre film.  There were moments that you found yourself asking, ""what is this film about?"".
The gist appears to be that of the life of a chap in the French Foreign Legion who has a spot of jealousy regarding one of the new recruits.  This is not really explained and I don't think a plot was on the mind of the production team when this film was made.
Watch it out of curiosity but don't buy it.  Get a book about African landscapes instead!!",1032912000,8,505,4.294736842105263
1779561,4,B00006JDTD,"Director Claire Denis' BEAU TRAVAIL is not an easy film to categorize.  Based in part on Herman Melville's novel, ""Billy Budd"" - and containing musical passages from Benjamin Britten's 1951 opera of the same name - the movie is arguably more effective in creating a mood than it is in telling the story of a French Foreign Legion officer's obsession with a young recruit.  And yet, depending on the viewer's individual tastes, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Unquestionably, all the elements assembled here are magnificent: the cinematography is stunning; the actors are perfectly cast; their performances are beautifully choreographed; the music is intriguing; and the editing is intriguing without being obtrusive.  It is as if Denis had purposely decided to draw upon aspects of a variety of artistic disciplines - including opera, the ballet, modern dance, painting, photography, pantomime and acrobatics - in committing her vision to film.  The result is a deliberately paced film that will appeal more to audiences who allow themselves to be swept in the style in which the simple story is told, rather than those who enjoy their plots to be laid out in linear fashion and embellished with unambiguous action.

BEAU TRAVAIL is heartily recommended to patient viewers who are willing to let its unique style stimulate their imaginations and emotions; film students, too, should take a look.  Others may find it downright frustrating, even incomprehensible.",1221091200,7,1466,5.266094420600858

1779563,5,B00006JDTD,"Melville's great Billy Budd story told from the perspective of Claggart, who is the villain in Melville's story, but he's not exactly so evil here, even though he does try to kill someone. A very simple and powerful story of irrational hatred and rivalry between two men in the French Foreign legion. The theme is eternal. And the storytelling is almost all done through images and music, very little dialogue. Not really sure why the reviews are so mixed. It's a truly compelling movie for anyone who appreciates great cinema. Unlike Melville's story, this one has a more sanguine ending, with both protagonists surviving. The movie ends with a truly amazing solo dance by the main protagonist. Anyone interested in modern dance should check it out.",1184025600,2,750,4.9603174603174605
1779564,1,B00006JDTD,"This movie is quite slow, for those who are expecting a gay film, this is not, it may under certain circunstances, but is more about tehe foreign legion in Africa. I saw it once, that was enough, I wouldn not recomended it",1151712000,4,222,4.309523809523809
1779565,5,B00006JDTD,"This movie is maddeningly slow. You really have to really be a certain kind of person to appreciate where Claire Denis is going here, and you have to willing to come along for the ride--the entire ride. I got it, and I loved it--but I also recognize that I'm probably in the minority.

Editorial reviews on the pretentious-side (e.g. the New Yorker) didn't have enough good things to say about Beau Travail. More down-to-earth reviews had a ""What the heck???"" feel to them.

For me, it was fortunate that I watched Beau Trvail in the theater--I was forced to yield a slice of my life over to the film. Being in an open and pensive mood also helped. Even then, it wasn't so much the movie itself but how it made me feel afterwards. It grew on me like a fungus, the neurons trying to process all of the subtext behind what (at the time) just seemed like 90 minutes of desert. After a few weeks, I found myself aching to connect again with the film, digesting every review I could find. The subway scenes peppered throughout the movie are telling, as are the forlorn Legionnaires singing of their lost-love. When the resolution comes, it is abrupt and powerful.

But this was a very personal experience, and my connection with the film probably says more about me as a person than anything about Beau Travail itself. Denis' ""Friday Night"" follows nearly the same pattern, but I found that film just as maddeningly slow but without the payoff.",1130630400,9,1439,4.591439688715953
1779566,2,B00006JDTD,"""Beau Travail"" or English translation of ""Good Work"" by French director Claire Denis is an interesting look at the Foreign Legion.  However, the story fails to fire and takes an incredibly long time to do so.  Despite showing the soldiers training and climbing over walls, scaling wires and jumping hurdles, there really is no action since none of this furthers the story.  Even the helicopter crash is not shown, just bits of debris and people floating in the water afterward.  Denis Lavant who was in ""A Very Long Engagement"" that was nominated for best foreign film last year plays Galoup, who prizes his relationship with his commanding officer Bruno Forestier.  When young Sentain comes into camp played by Gregoire Colin, Galoup becomes jealous and tries to discredit him.  That said, it's hard to say why Galoup is jealous.  Forestier is played by Michel Subor who worked with Denis in her film ""L'Intrus"" (The Intruder).  There doesn't appear to be any sexual relationship between these men, despite Denis' focus on photographing them without shirts, swimming nude and showering.  The real star of the film is the stark landscape of the Gulf of Djibouti.  (I had to look it up on my map to find it near Ethiopia & Somalia on the Red Sea.)  The disco sequence at the end of the film is nice, but it comes after we see Galoup on a bed with a gun in his hand.  Did he kill himself & go to disco heaven?  Did he decide not to shoot himself & go dancing by himself instead?  The project is a puzzle that fails to come together.  Taxi!",1121385600,4,1537,4.599264705882353

1779569,5,B00006JDTD,"This film caught me by surprise, I found it in my local video store (in Hereford, UK). As it was one of very few foreign legion films on the market I had to watch it. I spent 2 and half years where the film was filmed (Djibouti), some of the actors were genuine legionnaires, I recongized the names and faces, to this end, it was warming to see a fictional pictorial account of the Legion, and it brought back some harsh memories. The plot is hardly exciting, and at times the 'tia chi yoga in the desert is rather farcical, however, the image of true legionnaires doing the assault courses, the conditions they live in and the desert are highly accurate, to this end I found in refreshing in that although not an action packed drama, not a documentary, but an combination of the two, and not a ridiculouos Claude Van Damme stand up comedy. I would recommend this if only for its realisic content parts.  I would also highy recommend 'The Naked Soldier' by Tony sloane, a fantastically true account of the French Foreign legion, unlike no other.",1114128000,28,1045,4.529100529100529
1779570,5,B00006JDTD,"I guess a film (book, artwork...) that creates such a divergence in opinion is one that is worth checking out.

Not a truly difficult story to follow, as was suggested by a few other reviewers.  Certainly stark, but it's only like an hour and twenty minutes, not tedious by any stretch of imagination.

I saw this as something of a continuation of the saga Bruno Forestiere that started with Godard's ""Le Petit Soldat"".

Anyway, no use getting into too much film theory for this movie.  It's as beautifully shot as any movie, the ending was about the most intense (though bizarre) few minutes of a movie I can remember seeing.

This isn't ""three star"" (whatever that means) review.",1102982400,14,681,4.728813559322034
1779581,5,B00006JDTD,"Just had to throw in my 5 stars as this is one of my favorite films ever, and some of the poor reviews here do not do the film justice. Claire Denis is a wonderfully observant and subtle filmmaker of both land/nature and human emotions. The plot is loosely based on Billy Budd, but especially noteworthy is Agnes Varda's stark beautiful cinematography and Denis Lavant's amazing performance.  The final disco sequence is breathtaking, truly one of the best 'performance' sequences ever, and oddly in tune with other acrobatic feats Lavant has displayed in other films (Lovers on the Bridge  and Mauvais Sang)",1095638400,14,608,4.950980392156863

This is that movie, intensified 100 times.

Then again, after an hour you're ready for it to be over so you don't really get mad. I whole-heartedly recommend that you save your time and energy and watch/buy something else. I really wouldn't even recommend renting this one. As others have said, the actual cinematography is nothing to be ashamed of, but its almost like recording the lineolium peel and releasing it on DVD with a half naked guy on the cover.

1779583,1,B00006JDTD,"Beau Travail is Claire Denis's reductionist take on Melville's tragic tale of Billy Budd. While Melville gives us all we need to understand the plight of the beautiful and ill-starred young sailor and his tortured tormentor, Claggart, Denis opts to make everything so subliminal and barely articulated that we are left with stunning visuals of half-naked men doing calisthenics in the hot, windswept deserts of Djibouti and little else to inform us. The cinematography is gorgeous, but the storytelling is ambiguous, confusing, and deliberately opaque. The homoeroticism is beyond obvious, but since the director is a woman, it may be more fairly said to be a woman's enchanted view of the mysterious male wrapped in his wordless love of ritual, his casual, almost sensuous brutality, his obligatory isolation, and an almost servile idolatry of the male body. The way this film is visualized, the French Foreign Legion seems like nothing so much as the Nazi Brownshirts at summer camp.  And the story, told from within the mind of the chief antagonist, Galoup (Denis Lavant), is made with such minimalism as to be almost wholly obscured by the mannered style of the film.  Many reviewers were entranced by this film because of its luscious landscapes and blatant male splendor. While I think the film was beautiful, I found it virtually incomprehensible as a narrative, and ultimately just plain tedious to sit through.",1082073600,19,1419,5.138528138528138
1779584,3,B00006JDTD,"Beau Travail is a modern-day update of Billy Budd, although the plot is much changed and the characters more ambiguous.  Directed by French director Claire Denis (best known for 1988's ""Chocolat""), Beau Travail stars Denis Lavant as a Foreign Legion officer in Africa.  Lavant is the perfect officer, but he finds himself largely ignored by his commandant (Michel Subor), whom he greatly admires.  His jealousy is piqued when he sees his commandant drawn to a new recruit, Sentain (played by Gr&eacute;goire Colin).
The movie has some simple and beautiful scenery of barren Africa; accordingly it won several awards for its cinematography, including a Cesar (the equivalent of the French Oscar).  The tone of the film is mesmerizingly aloof, with little dialogue and character development (most are nameless and credited simply as ""legionnaire"").  However, the movie is glacier paced, relying on repeated imagery and stark narration.  There are also far too many scenes in which the camera lingers on the legionnaires training or ironing their clothes.  Despite the languid pace, the movie is rarely boring, as it manages to maintain a sense of intrigue.  In addition, the ending is amusingly peculiar and bewildering.",1074902400,13,1218,5.307291666666667
1779585,3,B00006JDTD,"Introspective and subtle, Claire Denis' BEAU TRAVAIL offers a modern retelling of Herman Melville's BILLY BUDD, transposing the tale of an officer who self-destructs through his jealousy of a new recruit to an outpost of the French Foreign Legion.  And although the film is elegant in both its simplicity and purity, I myself found it a shade too simple and pure to be completely effective.
Still, BEAU TRAVAIL has two things going for it: director Denis' cinematic eye and superior performances throughout.  One truly senses the location in all its elemental nature, and the cinematography is remarkable for its restrained elegance.  The cast follows suit, with direct and underplayed performances that fold seamlessly into both Denis' atmosphere and the story itself, and the result is often quite stylish.
But for all its elegance and style, I found BEAU TRAVAIL too introspective and subtle for its own good; to me it lacks any significant substance, with both story and characters slipping through my attention as easily as sand slips through my hand.  While this is doubtlessly part of director Denis' intent, and while I have admired many a film with a notably elusive touch, my ultimate reaction to BEAU TRAVAIL is that it is a rather superficial exercise in style over substance, and I cannot say that it leads me to interest in the director's other work.
The DVD transfer is reasonable, if not entirely first rate, and there are few bonuses of any kind.  In passing, I also note that BEAU TRAVAIL is often marketed as a film with homoerotic context and imagery, but I personally did not find it so.  Final word: worth a look, but not greatly memorable for all that.

1779586,3,B00006JDTD,"I saw *Beau Travail* at the theatres and thought it was excellent.  And purchasing the DVD, I still think it's an incredibly good film.  However, I'm VERY disappointed in the DVD transfer quality from New Yorker Films.
It seems that they transferred a VHS copy to DVD, so the image has lots of visual noise, irritating scan lines, and general poor quality video.  The picture tears apart in the action scenes.

1779587,5,B00006JDTD,"Those reviewers who gave this film low ratings should stick to watching Braveheart and Sleepless in Seattle. Sure, the film is visually beautiful but definitely NOT in a picture postcard way. For the director the unifying theme is 'rhythm' - the rhythm of men working in the desert engaged in seemingly futile work, the rhythm of the disco, the rhythmic patterns in a carpet made by the local women. The hero's faith in the rhythms of military life is undermined by envy and desire for the new recruit. The film is about the fall from faith in the conventional, the sinking into the abyss and finally the redemption of both characters. Every detail is artful in this film and it's worth watching it two or three times to pick up on the good stuff. And I agree with a previous reviewer - the ending is one of the best ever.",1044835200,12,822,4.486666666666666
1779588,5,B00006JDTD,"This film moves me. It IS different from so many other movies ( that, in all fairness, are striving to send a message far different from ""Beau Travail"").
No frontal nudity, no gay sex, no IV drug use, no child abuse, no car chases, no gunfights, no Greek Idol pretty boys, no trite dialog.....just a believable human drama, well acted, and shown with absolutely stunning photography of  Djibuti, Africa.
Not to give the plot away, but I thought the focus of this film was the internal struggle of the Claggart character as he tried to come to terms with just why he hated the Billy Budd character so much. And unlike the Claggart on the ""Rights of Man"" who is killed by Billy's blow, this French Foreign Legion sergeant lives to regret the emotions that overcame him. (Personally, I'm still working and thinking on that aspect of the story. It's not all spelled out for you like most American movies.)
This deserves, in my view, a full FIVE STARS.
If  ""Art""  can be defined as ""something that makes you think"", then ""Beau Travail"" passes that test for me.  Three stars? Absolutely not!  This story deserves a much more appreciation and a much higher Amazon rating.",1043020800,13,1164,4.658536585365853

The dialog amounts to a few incohate phrases and little human interaction. The scenery of Djibouti is breathtaking, but ""Sheltering Sky"" is much better. The rigor of French Foreign Legion training (and the consequent impoverishment of the Legionaires intellectual and spiritual lives) is interesting to observe, but this move can't be recommended.",1040601600,9,668,5.252336448598131

There is no point in trying to convey a story-line to you as there was no script, no script, no acting, no character to follow, no hero, only sweaty Legionnaire's running around the desert posing sometimes naked and bare chested. And even this is a bore.
 I really liked Denis' Chocolat, it had character plot and great acting, but she was directing mostly women. She did not know what to do with all these men in a desert, running around looking at each other as if in a daze. And the ending was really too much for anyone to bare. Heh, the scenery was OK!

7970051,5,B00006JDTD,"Recently, I went back and re-read Melvilles original novel and then took time to view a couple of film versions of the classic novel. I wound up wanting to recommend two films, including this one by the great French writer-director Claire Denis whose film career focuses especially on relationships between Europeans and Africans. If you're familiar with her work at all, it may be from a viewing of her wonderful, thought-provoking 1988 film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolat/dp/B00005J75R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolat</a>&nbsp;(And, no, thats not the 2000 romance co-starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp even though the titles are the same.) Or perhaps from viewing her 2009 movie with Isabelle Hupert, White Material. That movie now is available in a terrific Criterion edition:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Material-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B004JPJHLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Material (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>] Denis has many films to her credit, but these two seem to be her most popular in the U.S.

I headlined this review with the phrase a Form of Dance because I think that phrase helpfully names the sort of dreamlike state or the abstract nature of the narrative identified by other reviewers. Obviously, the movie is not formally a work of modern dance. But the moment I began watching Beau Travail, I jotted myself a note: bodies in motion. The movie literally begins with men and women dancing in Djubouti, the setting of most of the films action.

Thats right, Denis has taken Billy Budd off the high seas and transformed the basic story into a tale of the legendary French Foreign Legion. Oh, theres still lots of sea water in this movie. Waves repeatedly flow across the screenone of the rhythmic motifs that highlight the fluidity of the male and female bodies that always seem to be in motion in this tale.

Beau Travail now is a highly celebrated movie. Its in the middle of Sight & Sound magazines highly esteemed international list of best films. But some viewers continue to raise questions, including: Whats going on here!? And it is true that the minimal amount of dialogue in this film doesnt exactly clarify every point in the unfolding plot. Instead, viewers sit back and fall into this pattern of physical and emotional movement: dancing, swimming, climbing, calisthenics, military training exercises, fighting, migration and even a hand writing a memoir in flowing script across paper.

The other impact of Denis's artistic choices is a softening of the ""evil officer"" (originally Claggart and here renamed Galoup). The original tension in Melville's novel (and in the Peter Ustinov movie version) is between the mesmerizing, prophetic honesty of young Billy. There is a purity to Billy's honesty that cannot survive in the compromised world of conflict at sea. Pitted against him is the ""evil"" Claggart whose life has twisted his moral code and vision of others to the point that he violently wants to dominate as many of the men as possibleand ultimately decides to crush Billy. In Denis's retelling of the basic tale, Galoup ultimately reaches the same desire to destroy this young man he cannot seem to dominate any other way. But there's a difference here. Now, the narrative shifts more to Galoup's viewpoint, rather than Billy's or anyone else's. And as the energy of the narrative shifts from actual dialogue to various forms of movement, we actually feel an empathy for Galoup that would have been impossible with the Darth Vader-like blackness of Claggart's moral compass.

Ultimately, while it may seem a bit disorienting at first, Claire Denis's film is a revelation, opening new perspectives on Melville's original plot. This film richly deserves the praise it has garnered over the years. If you're considering buying a copy, youll be richly rewarded if you can accept the lyrical, somewhat abstract style of the narrative. And I don't want to spoil the very striking final scene of the film, but it definitely underlines the metaphoric use of dance I am describing in this review.",1488153600,2,4175,5.426810477657935

Long-serving sergeant grows seemingly unexplainable antipathy towards a young, popular-among-comrades, noticed positively by a commander, barely-speaking-French brave Russian mercenary.

Is it because of a teen possessing some qualities a senior man dreams of? Or, simply, because maturer man is merely naturally jealous for fast-learning, attractiveness, easy-going attitude a young male-a potential competitor demonstrates? Or, is it something sub-brain sexual?

Whatever brilliant itself movie is, it hardly meets efforts and, definitely, a sum total met by the ordering at Amazon.",1435276800,,772,6.12962962962963
7970054,5,B00006JDTD,"Saw this film some time back in LA on the
Ind. Film Channel - I fell into the poetic-like
ambiance - or is it dream-like ?  & had my
jaw drop at the end - I grapped the listings
of tv showings & watched it again that
week - by the third time it became one of
my all time favourite hauntingly alluring films
 & has remained so ---
 it is a mental & visual treat -but like many things -
 simply not for everyone --- you'll know

PS- It may also help to know a bit about
the Legion - there is a well written book
available on Amazon by Simon Murray
titled ' Five Years In The French Foreign
Legion ' -a diary he kept & every single
entry is an insight into his experience.
It is also something to recall when life
gets a little tough/rough . But-too- you
get the sense of the almost Zen-Like
attitude & meditative mind set that is
underlying the extraordinary precision
& every day event - even if ironing.",1407369600,,903,4.050561797752809
7970055,3,B00006JDTD,"""Beau Travail"" (1999) is directed by Claire Denis (Chocolat, White Material). The film is about the Legionnaire's life, and is mostly a series of images of the soldiers camped out and living in a stark desert environment. There is almost no acting so the movie lacks the customary dynamics one might expect in a movie. The film's underlying story is about the Sergeant and his hatred for one of the soldiers. The film just sort of washes over the viewer with its minimalistic approach that seems to mimic the dry, barren desert environment that surrounds the men.

The dvd is so so as there are some instances of dust, and the resolution is not very high for a dvd. If one is watching this dvd on a 50"" or larger tv then jaggies are quite prominent at times. The resolution looks to be less than 480p, perhaps closer to VHS quality. There are also no special features except for the theatrical trailer. This film is rated #78 on Sight and Sound's top 100 films of all time.",1400544000,2,973,4.497175141242938

7970057,4,B00006JDTD,"This is my latest addition to my ""military/war flicks"" collection.

From an artistic viewpoint, the film is beautifully shot and beautifully edited. Everything is treated quite lushly by the shooting/editing.

The military aspects? I'll go with the reviewer who says it shows the atmosphere of the French military in Djibouti - also interesting to read some of the Legionnaires in the film really ARE Legionnaires. Still, can't see elite military forces doing the tai chi/yoga thing in the desert, much less the ""chest butting""/man hugging exercise.

My biggest gripe: the lead actor as an NCO. His face was craggy enough for the role, and he seemed buff enough, but whoever dressed him could have done a far better job. He looked NOWHERE near as sharp as some of the others in the group, whereas in real life, he would have been FAR sharper than the others (sharper, perhaps, than the officer as well).

Still don't know what to make of the ending.

Overall, a worthwhile addition to my military flick collection.",1336953600,,1014,4.906432748538012
7970058,4,B00006JDTD,"Certainly a thought provoking film, like all this director's work. It was like watching a situation evolve from a careful distance with no involvement. None of the characters were developed in the usual sense, and none seemed to be really involved with each other, except by proximity. To call it voluptuous seems odd. The bodies were there, but not too interesting in any sensual way. Sergeant Galoup was the only character that showed any kind of ""emotion"" (if you can call it that) or created any ripples in the deadpan tone of the whole film. He was the only thing that happened, and that was still from a distance. I guess it could be called choreographed. A slice of life? I don't know if I ""liked"" the film or want to watch it again, but since I bought one I will probably do so one day and maybe pass it on. In other words, I wasn't spellbound or drawn in--just found it an interesting experience. Gregoire Colin is always worth watching.",1296086400,3,946,4.538011695906433
7970059,5,B00006JDTD,"La directora -a decir de Steiner- hace una interpretacin responsable de ""Billy Budd"", el texto de Herman Melville: Traslada la aventura marina a un escuadrn de legionarios, en pleno desierto africano, y a travs de los vnculos que unen a estos soldados, ahonda en los sentimientos de los hombres.

La Belleza -encarnada en el joven e inocente Gilles- es confrontada con la iniquidad, la envidia y el sadismo del sargento Galoup, en una autoimpuesta competencia por reconocimiento de Forestier, ese capitn subyugado por la presencia del joven legionario, a quien dirige una mirada que transita sutil y sugerente entre el afecto y la homosexualidad.

La desesperante y desesperanzada voz de Galoup narra la historia en primera persona, y el potico -y las ms de las veces silente relato- es acompaado por sensaciones visuales (imgenes que son verdaderas postales), tctiles, de movimiento (el entrenamiento del grupo es una hermosa danza de esfuerzo y sensualidad), dan como resultado un poema visual de inigualable belleza. Una exquisita obra de arte.
