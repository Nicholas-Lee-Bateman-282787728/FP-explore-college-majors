I appreciated the way the documentary shows Capras best work as often darker and less corny or sentimentalized than its remembered.  Heroes earn any happy endings they get, and there is often pain, self-doubt and loss along the way.  It makes the valid point that ""emotional"" and ""ultimately hopeful"" is far different from ""sentimental"" and ""corny"", and Capra knew and fought for that difference.

A lot of the interviews with other directors, actors, friends and family are very effective, although there are a few Hollywood types whos connection to Capra and his work seems tenuous at best, and sometimes analysis gives way to gushing.  While not quite deep, emotional or revelatory enough to be a great film, it is a very good one, that any film buff should certainly see.",1459036800,,974,4.950920245398773
7872721,5,6304481721,"Excellent. The film includes all the famous scenes of all Capra's movies, as well as great movie history.  Also interesting was the story of the struggles within Capra's personal life, which connect with his movie-making.  I lent this to a friend who is a big Capra fan, and he thought it was great.  It should be made into a DVD format because most people have dumped their VHS players or don't have combo's.",1440547200,,409,4.575342465753424
