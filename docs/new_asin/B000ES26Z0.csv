Any time I travel someplace and want a video remembrance, they cover everything I've seen in the same way as I remember and have the facts covered in detail.  After 25 years of buying Finley travel videos, I'm glad to see they're still being produced.  After many visits to Lake Powell over the years, I'm still enjoying this video, now in DVD.",1357430400,,377,4.597014925373134
8113802,2,B000ES26Z0,"Going for a vacation in Utah & Arizona in March, I bought this DVD to get info about Lake Powell. Having seen lots of BBC produced documentaries and working in the film industry, I'm expecting HQ video. This main video on this DVD is below broadcast quality and even has a few dropouts - that is not acceptable!

Some of the extra material has better quality video - but seems more like a holiday video presentation than a professional documentary. Apart from that - it still offers some interesting info and history about the lake.",1200787200,3,532,4.6
