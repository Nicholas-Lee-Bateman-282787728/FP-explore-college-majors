8358889,2,B002A4IY5M,"After a few months of bad breaks and disappointing television, TNA started to get on the mend with the return of top guys like AJ Styles and Samoa Joe as well as an intriguing storyline between Angle and Sting over control of the Main Event Mafia and the TNA Championship. That's not to say ""Destination X"" was a good show, because it wasn't, yet it started to push things in the right direction.

The turmoil in the Main Event Mafia had shades of the nWo storyline in 1997, and the addition of Mick Foley and Jeff Jarrett to the sideline managed to make the match feel like a genuine combustible situation with four guys that all hated each other. Even though the match wasn't as good as their 2007 encounter, the story in this one was compelling enough to keep it afloat.

The rest of the show is mostly forgettable, such as Samoa Joe's return against Scott Steiner, Eric Young getting squashed and a woefully dull Legends Title match between Booker T and AJ Styles. The non-match with Steiner and Joe was the most disappointing since those two had a great match three years earlier.

The two matches worth seeing on this show were the Ultimate X match between Suicide, the Motor City Machine Guns and Lethal Consequences where everybody got a chance to pull of crazy moves and show off their characters. The other was a strong tag team match between Beer Money, inc. and Team 3D that was simply a tease for better things to come.

Although the show isn't great, there are a few decent things to see here. Overall, it's a better show than ""Genesis"" and ""Against All Odds"", though I don't think anything on this show can compete with Jarrett/Angle from January.",1411257600,,1662,4.585858585858586
8358890,5,B002A4IY5M,"There were really only two reasons why i bought this DVD, to relive when TNA was great with the 6 Sided Ring and to see Daffney working the Gov gimmick.
Don't get me wrong the matches are great top to bottom with the stand-outs being Matt Morgan vs Abyss in a 10,000 Tacks Match and World Heavyweight Championship between Kurt Angle vs Sting and it goes without saying Taylor Wilde, Roxxi & The Governor vs The Beautiful People.
For me this DVD is a 5/5 for others i'm guessing 4/5.",1369526400,,482,4.366666666666666

8358892,2,B002A4IY5M,"Please excuse the title but I just got done watching Star Wars & the title seems right for this event. This is another review where I'm not going to waste my time doing a match by match review because I'll just end up repeating the same thing time & time again. After TNA got off to a bad start in 2009 with all the injuries causing all the last minute changes to Genesis followed by Against All Odds being a complete dud, Destination X began to put TNA back on the right path as it helped setup the matches for their upcoming LockDown PPV, started making moves in the M.E.M./Frontline storyline to make it somewhat interesting again after the heels dominated for months....however, the quality here really seemed like this was more of a 3 hour episode of Impact instead of a PPV.

The main event here was the battle within' the Main Event Mafia as Sting defended the TNA Title vs. Kurt Angle with the twist that Jeff Jarrett was the referee & Mick Foley was the special enforcer in what was a solid match but was more about setting up the matches going into the next PPV than having a quality match like their series in '07. The other matches on the card were average here such as A.J. Styles vs. Booker T for the Legends Championship in a match that never seemed to leave first gear, and Team 3D's entertaining match with Beer Money despite the crappy ending. The highlight of the PPV without a doubt was the best Ultimate X Match since Bound For Glory '07 with the Motor City Machine Guns vs. Lethal Consequences vs. Suicide filled with the crazy spots & ""Holy Crap"" moments you expect from this match.

The rest of the card was full of really short matches that went under 10 mins. that were either good for what they were (the Knockouts six woman tag), ""matches"" that were just there to put a storyline over (Samoa Joe debuting his new ""Nation Of Violence"" character on Scott Steiner) or just nothing special at all (Morgan/Abyss Thumbtacks Match, Kong/Bolt, and Eric Young...who only days earlier got the ultimate rub from Sting by representing him in the Impact main event...losing to Brutus Magnus who wasn't seen on TV or talked about in the previous month in a last minute filler.) The matches were real short to make time for talk segments like the finals of the ""One Night With O.D.B."" contest which was nothing more than a way to introduce the Cody Deaner character and was one of the most awful ""in-ring segments"" I've ever seen along with a confrontation between Jim Cornette & Sheik Abdul Bashir.

Overall, I'd say the first half of this PPV is very skipable with the only thing watchable being the opening Knockouts tag but the second half picks up with all the matches being average/solid encounters but really nothing memorable while setting up the storylines for the LockDown PPV the next month. So in the end, this really came off as a 3 hour edition of Impact instead of a PPV in that the purpose was to setup everything future storylines going into the next PPV more than anything else. The only match on here that has a heavy replay value is the Utlimate X so if you have a few spare bucks that you won't miss...get this but it would have been better to package this in another ""Cross The Line"" set.",1245024000,,3223,4.505982905982906
