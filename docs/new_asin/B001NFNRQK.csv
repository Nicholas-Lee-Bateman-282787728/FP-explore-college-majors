8326756,4,B001NFNRQK,"Very early edition of the Bowery Boys 4-reeler series which lasted until the late 1950s. With varying names, they started out on Broadway, made some very important features, then settled into the ""B"" movie department of Monogram Pictures.

Huntz Hall had not yet gained prominence as Gorcy's right hand man (right hook man?) and so Bobby Jordan is heavily spotlighted, playing the younger Brother of a guy framed for murder. The whole gang winds up in reform school where they discover the truth about the robbery and killing, via a news reel with telling evidence (and a clip of a kooky, off-kilter Billy Gilbert, as the not overbright assistant to a well-known gangster, thought to be drowned). Don't want to give away the ending!

Sam Katzman (""King of the 'Bs' "") directed this black and white classic. Would love to give it a capital ""C"" but it *is* a B. You understand.

Excellent script (wonder how much of it got printed?) and tight direction put this one over the top.
