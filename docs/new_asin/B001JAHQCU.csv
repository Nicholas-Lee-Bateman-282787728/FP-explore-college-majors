It  involves  a  preacher  whom  Festus  must  protect  because  the  towns  people  do  not  want  him  to  build  a  church  to  share  with  the  Indians,  Another  episode  involves  a  school  teacher  who  wants  to  establish  an  education  in  Dodge City  despite  what  he  must  face  against  the  citizens.  &  of  course  Festus  chases  an  outlaw  who's  an  escaped  prisoner  out  into  a  desert  &  is  saved  by  a  hermit  after  getting  slightly  wounded.
Gunsmoke  is  a  good  show.  One  I've  enjoyed  in  the  past,  &  hope  to  enjoy  again,  I  do  though  regret  not  buying  this  thing  on  DVD  the  complete  series  when  I  had  the  chance,  I  saw  the  complete  series  box  in  a  store  one  time,  but  didn't  buy  it  because  it  would  have  costed  me  nearly  400.00.  If  I  do  see  the  complete  series  again  seasons  1-20  I  won't  hesitate  to  buy  it  on  DVD!  This  is  the  only  season  without  Kitty  (Amanda Blake)  &  we  see  a  new  owner  of  the  long  branch  named  Hannah.  I  never  knew  exactly  what  happened  to  Kitty.  That's  what  you  see  in  this  season.  During  the  theme  song  at  the  beginning  when  you  see  Matt Dillon's  name  announced  (James  Arness)  you  can  tell  by  looking  at  his  face  he  is  starting  to  show  a  little  age,  perhaps  early  50's.  &  still  does  a  fantastic  job  as  the  character  he  plays.  He  shows  no  signs  of  submission  when  facing  a  bad  guy,  &  Festus  does  a  good  job  being  funny  &  being  serious  when  he  must.
I'll  tell  you  why  I'm  leaving  a  review,  because  some  of  my  favorite  episodes  are  in  the  final  seasons.  &  it  would  mean  a  lot  to  me  if  all  the  seasons  were  out  on  DVD.  I  had  my  chance  to  buy  the  complete  series  box  set  &  I  blew  it!  I  just  hope  &  pray  I  am  given  a  second  chance  somewhere  down  the  road!  For  now  though  I  guess  I'll  just  have  to  play  the  waiting  game.",1482883200,2,2055,4.100591715976331
