8356053,2,B0028CTYKA,"The plot, the acting and the ambience seem promising. However, it's hard to tell because the quality is some of the worst I've ever seen in a release. Ragged picture quality, distracting flaws, and distorted sound leave the disappointed viewer in a tough position of wanting to enjoy it but straining to follow things at all. You can't really see the faces of the actors, enjoy the scenery or follow the music (I speak fluent French). A lot of charm and high spirits have been wasted by whoever had the nerve to put this release on the market.",1354233600,2,543,4.551020408163265
8356054,5,B0028CTYKA,"Boston schoolteacher Elizabeth Rockwell (played by Merle Oberon) inherits a chateau, but finds a family of squatters in possession - a widower and his five children.  The character Paul Rencourt is played by Paul Henreid.  This is a black and white film produced in 1951 with the technology of that time period.  The DVD is now somewhat hard to obtain (at this writing) but is of interest to fans of the cast members.",1313798400,3,417,4.684931506849315
