2121241,3,B0002V7OHY,"Those who were hoping that perhaps the release of ""Blue's Clues"" box-sets might bring new special features, such as commentary or behind-the-scenes documentaries, are going to be disappointed. If you've been keeping up on your ""Blue's Clues"" DVD releases, then there is nothing here you haven't already seen. ABC's 123's and More Collection is nothing more than a repackaging of three previous DVDs: Blue Takes You to School, Shapes and Colors, and Blue's Big Band. If you don't have those, or haven't seen them before, this box-set might be worth checking out, since you get a lower price than you would purchasing all three separately. Otherwise, I recommend passing on this box-set.",1100736000,170,685,5.125

Its not only entertaining but educational too. I like that my son can put it on any time he wants, get out his paper and pencil and find some clues.

2121294,5,B0002V7OHY,"My Grandson doesn't get much TV but has enjoyed Blues Clues since he was a baby. When exposed to a variety of different ""kid show"" choices, it was Blues Clues that held his attention. Some of the first words he said were from episodes of Blues Clues. It moves slow enough to give kids time to think through problems so the information sticks.  He is 2 1/2 now and loves it even more..",1380585600,,384,4.260273972602739

We also watch the Colors episode.  Both are Joe episodes.  For some reason it doesn't automatically adjust the aspect on my TV, but it's no big deal to do it manually.",1375833600,,316,4.322033898305085

2121298,3,B0002V7OHY,"I am not a fan nor familiar with Blue when I bought this DVD ... so why did i? Because several persons recommended it so I gave Blues Clues a try. And this product came with a range of topics like going to school, letter and numbers.

Product comes with three dvds and each dvd has two episodes plus two bonus episodes so four per dvd. I find the show a bit tacky and boring but my two daughters (aged 1 and 2) seem to really take to it. At the time of this review, I cannot say it's helping them count or speak better but when it's on, they follow it and can't stop watching; I cannot turn off an episode in the middle even if they saw it before ... it must play to the end.

Considering they never saw Blue's Clues before, I'd say it was a hit.",1368576000,,746,3.933774834437086

2121304,3,B0002V7OHY,"I was disappointed that it was Joe and not Steve. They have bonus features showing the episodes with Steve but overall it will be Joe. I have a 16 year old and we all grew up with Steve and I purchased this dvd combo in hopes of passing along the Blue's Clues tradition to my 2 year old. I am under the impression there was some deliberate false advertising because when I ordered it the first name they had starring was Steve Burns followed by everyone else.
Overall the teaching fundamentals are great but to be honest Joe just doesn't cut it.",1350172800,,545,4.352941176470588

You think it's strange but I have learned that old cherished TV shows like Blues Clues can be great gifts for over stressed college kids. It is familiar, comforting and relaxing to their minds.

2121307,3,B0002V7OHY,"Nothing personal toward 'Joe'...but he works too hard to appear natural and it gets in the way of his performance in Blue's Clues. Blue is the same, but we had a very hard time getting into the shows in this set because Steve is NO WHERE to be found. My toddler lost interest quickly.

If you are hoping to see the original Blues Clues with Steve, get another set of DVDs. This one is labeled with Steve Burns, but he is NOT in this set. Sorry! Amazon needs to fix that typo.",1315958400,2,475,4.163043478260869

2121309,5,B0002V7OHY,"My son loves Blue's Clues... he likes Donovan, but the truth is that he loves Steve. He always wants me to play the bonus episodes. All DVD's (3 Total) has bonus Steve episodes for a total of 5 episodes per DVD. Enough to keep the kids busy while we work around the house. My grandson loves to dance with Donovan. My son laugh a lot with Steve occurrences. 100% recommendation.",1288396800,,377,4.4

Here's an idea.  Why not list the 3 videos it does contain?  Seems obvious...",1285027200,4,252,4.276595744680851

2121324,5,B0002V7OHY,"My son, Reuben LOVES Blue Clues!! We just received this video collection in the mail. When Reuben saw it, he wanted to watch them right away. He was so excited so I let him. Reuben LOVES both Joe or Steve in Blue Clues. What's awesome about this collection is the educational value and entertainment for my son. I believe if a child watches educational videos, it's healthier for their development then watching TV with commercials. At least my son can focus on something longer than 3 hours.

I highly recommend anything Blue Clues! Every child is different. If he or she doesn't like it now, maybe later.",1241654400,,606,4.663551401869159
2121325,5,B0002V7OHY,My daughter loves Blues Clues.  Educational TV is fantastic.  She hardly sits to watch it but she does learn when she is running around and occasionally stops to watch.  What a fun way to help her learn more about the things I am already teaching her.,1236729600,,251,4.413043478260869
2121326,5,B0002V7OHY,"My husband and I were so used to watching Joe. Yes, we are guilty of judging Joe, too. Our two-year-old son is so much smarter. He sat through one episode after another with Joe leading him on. I was set-up to give Joe a second chance, of course. Now I understand better. I believe other Steve fans will realize as well what the producers saw in Joe. He is just a normal-looking guy who acts himself. I appreciate the fact that he doesn't try too hard to copy Joe's style. There's really no need to play overly dumb. The poor guy has big shoes to fill. Therefore, he suffers from comparison. He reminds me of someone else's second child.

Joe is not difficult to watch especially after so many repeats. The DVD material is just so good to pass on. This collection includes the basic lessons for every toddler/preschooler. They are so worth the money considering the number of times your child will be watching them. The bonus part here is that they are safe to watch. Sesame Street is so much fast-paced and more suitable for kids beyond four. Moms, beware of flashy and fast-faced programs for children under 18 months old. For infants, Teletubbies is more suitable. The slower the better. By exposing your children to Sesame Street early on, you'll find them having difficulty sitting patiently in a traditional classroom in the future. I know so
after having 20 years of teaching experience.",1225152000,,1394,4.666666666666667
2121327,5,B0002V7OHY,"My daughter is crazy for Blues Clues.  We bought this set of videos a while ago and still watch them at least twice a week!  I wish Blues Clues were still around, but these videos help with that.",1222732800,,195,4.105263157894737
2121328,3,B0002V7OHY,"I wish it would have been made clear that these DVDs featured Joe, and not Steve as I thought they did.  My daughter is not as much of a fan of Joe.  It is nice that are a few ""bonus"" episodes on each disc that do star Steve.  Other than that they are informative and arrived in great condition ahead of time.",1221264000,,309,3.9516129032258065
2121329,5,B0002V7OHY,"Very entertaining as with most Blue's Clues materials but more than that, this one captures the interest & motivation of learning for babies & toddlers.  We're amazed at how fast our little one is retaining knowledge of the basics & her application of them when not watching the dvd.

This edition is one she chooses often!

We highly recommend for babies/toddlers & for use in daycare facilities & preschool!",1220832000,2,409,4.898550724637682
2121330,4,B0002V7OHY,"My kids love Blue's Clues.  The show makes the presentation of the beginning to learn the subject given for each show very entertaining.  My only problem was that the offered bundle of another DVD at a really reduced rate was one already included in the collection I was originally purchasing.  It was a bit hard to tell which DVDs were in the collection, and I therefore thought I was getting a fourth DVD.  Instead, I was getting a second copy of one in the collection already.",1207699200,,479,4.534883720930233
2121331,4,B0002V7OHY,"I got this for my toddler who loves ""Blues Clues"" to break out on a long car-trip.  While he and I love the videos (they're fun, calm, educational, and entertaining), the way these DVD's are set up is frustrating.  Each one has four shows, but only two are accessible from the main menu, the other two are found in a ""Bonus Episodes"" section, so ""Play All"" isn't an option.  After playing the first two episodes, I had to pull off the interstate so I could see the DVD screen and navigate to the proper menu and get the other episodes going.  Unfortunately, I only found this out when I was going 70mph and got yells of frustration from my toddler in the back seat!

All in all, this is a great collection of ""Blues Clues"" episodes, but a pain to navigate through them!",1189641600,5,769,4.34965034965035
2121332,5,B0002V7OHY,"This is an absolute great deal!! I ordered this collection on Sunday, received it on Tuesday afternoon. My toddler watched 2 of the 3 dvds yesterday and finished watching the other one today. I don't understand why others have said that Steve isn't on the dvds. Each one of the dvd's do have bonus episodes, most of the bonus episodes are of Steve and not Joe. I do think there are special features on each dvd. I know one dvd does have an interactive play feature. My toddler was playing it earlier.

Of course my toddler loves Joe and Steve both, so it was a win win situation for us. Definitely worth the money!!",1185321600,,615,4.394736842105263

2121345,5,B0002V7OHY,"My daughter (almost 4) just loves all the Blue's Clue's stories. And I as a mom don't feel too bad to sit my kids (my son is 21 months old) in front of the TV while I am cooking. Kids can really learn a lot from Blue's Clues and my daughter even responds to Steve or Joe when they ask something. The length of the episodes is just the right one as well.

This collection includes the DVDs Shapes and colors!, Blue's Big Band, and Blue Takes You to School.",1170892800,5,455,4.055555555555555
2121346,5,B0002V7OHY,My 22 month old son loves this DVD. He learns shapes and colors and also numbers from this DVD.,1163030400,2,95,4.052631578947368
2121347,5,B0002V7OHY,"I was hoping this boxed set would have Blue goes to school and also some more with letters and sounds, but we have all these in this set.

HOWEVER, if you've never tried Blue's Clues with your child, they will probably be thoroughly engaged.

These are great learning tools, memorization, etc, and the kids love them. My daughter LOVED shapes and colors and knew all of them by 18 months watching this, memorization I guess.

I saw the parent of a 15 month old say her child wasn't interested, I think that's not suprising. Baby Einstein is the only thing I would expect a child so young to pay attention to.

My son was the same, he also loved Blue's Clues, but would give anything a second glance until age 2. Daughter, yes, but girls tend to have a longer attention span sooner. Give this series a second chance when your baby gets up a little bigger, they are great!",1151366400,3,870,4.41875
2121348,5,B0002V7OHY,"Each disc contains 4 episodes: 2 ""main"" episodes with Joe, and 2 ""bonus"" episodes with STEVE!!! Yes, the one and only Steve Burns, the original Blue's Clues host. You just have to use the DVD menu to get to the Episode Selection screen, and the Bonus Episodes are the ones with Steve.

My daughter is 16 months old, and Blue's Clues is the only show she's interested in. She gets very excited when she knows that it's coming on, or when I put one of the DVDs in the player. She dances for the songs, especially the main Blue's Clues song, and this is the only show she'll actually watch (and want to watch). She doesn't seem to care if it's Steve or Joe, but my wife and I prefer Steve (nothing against Joe, but Steve just has this way about him that makes the show more entertaining, even for adults).

All in all, this is a great collection, and not deserving of the low star rating it was getting. Blue's Clues is a fantastic, award-winning kids' show, that emphasizes fun learning and building self-confidence and encourages kids to think through things for themselves. This DVD set is no exception to that high level of quality.",1140480000,43,1133,4.495145631067961
