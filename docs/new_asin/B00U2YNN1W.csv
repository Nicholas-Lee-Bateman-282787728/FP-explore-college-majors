8704189,5,B00U2YNN1W,"Can understand why it is selling so well. Great DVD, rare Lawler vs Rich Match. Also good quality and nice mix if matches. This is a winner if you like Southern Wrestling. All the top names are here Gilbert, Mantell, Armstrong, DWB's and so many more. 22 matches and a Lawler feud recap by Jerry himself. Nice DVD",1435795200,5,313,4.413793103448276
