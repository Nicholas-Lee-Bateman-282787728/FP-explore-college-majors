8344494,2,B001UN1KXW,"Race car driver and archeologist Michael Nazzarro (Steven Brand) is in Moscow lecturing, racing, and looking for the treasure of the Night Templar. He ends up dating Natasha, student and sister of Wolf (Alexander Nevsky). Wolf runs an unsanctioned street race, night club, crook, does Arnold impersonations, and happens to have an amulet hanging around his neck that can decode a book to lead to the secret treasure. But wait! There's more! The Russian police are after them, some guys from South American and David Carradine.

The film looks like it was meant to be a TV pilot that never took off as the film ended where it strongly suggested a sequel.

Fairly lame and boring production for an action film. Better off watching old Starsky and Hutch episodes. Available on a Walmart multi-pack.

Parental Guide: no f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1388534400,,840,4.943262411347518
8344495,2,B001UN1KXW,"An American teaching in Russia is also looking for the lost treasure of the Templars. He is in Russia because he is convinced the treasure is in Moscow somewhere. He finances his excursions by entering street races with his souped up car. The man running the races is a muscle-bound philanthropist who steals drugs from dealers to get them off the street. This man, Wolf, has an amulet that will help unravel the mystery of the Templars. Along the way the professor falls in love with Wolf's sister, reveals he has an 800 year old manuscript written by the last Templar leader because they are related and helps Wolf fight off the drug dealers who want there product and money back. David Carradine also shows up as a historian who lets the professor do all the work and then tries to steal the results for himself.

Treasure Raiders took Raiders of the Lost Ark, National Treasure, The Fast and the Furious, and every action movie Arnold Schwarzeneggar ever made and put them into a blender to come up with this pile of crap and called it a movie. The acting is terrible, the writing is childish, the direction and editing, well, I don't think there was any. The professor supposedly finances his research by racing but he loses every race in the movie. He has no knowledge of this Wolf person before but Wolf miraculously has the amulet that is the key to finding the Templar treasure. At one point the drug dealers kidnap Wolf's girlfriend. The scene where he goes to rescue her is one of the most unintentionally hilarious and inept scenes I've ever seen in a film.",1338163200,,1569,4.603571428571429

8344497,3,B001UN1KXW,"Treasure Raiders pulls some storylines from big budget films, but it is catchy and action packed.  Alexander Nevsky is larger than life in person and in the film.  If you like street racing films and a little adventure, you will like this one.

8344498,2,B001UN1KXW,"I really wanted to give this movie more.  I liked the idea a lot. The mystery of the templars, the mystery of Russia.  It was a good idea.

But the script and the acting was absolutely horrible.  Even the car races that they tried to use to liven up the film were not up to snuff.

One of the main characters, Wolf, was so Arnold-esk in his early films that I can see him making more action films in the next 5 years.  Hopefully with acting lessons under his belt.  However one mystery to the film.  Wolf's girlfriend.  She gets kidnapped, rescued, then is in the click trying to solve the templar mystery and then we never see her again. Probably the last 30 min., she's disappeared.  She was kind of a presistant and likable, terciary character, and just disappears. For a moment I thought it would get spiced up with her turning spy or double agent but nothing.
