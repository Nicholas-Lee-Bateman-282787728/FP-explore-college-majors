6448428,5,B00KU3Y4JA,"If you are a fan of Mr. Freeman's work, then you will gladly be taught the meaning of our populated world with the atmospheric cultures, system of the outer world around us, the meaning of what science vs life amongst human beings is compared.",1413849600,3,243,4.545454545454546
6448429,5,B00KU3Y4JA,"WOW, this series is one that I have never seen before, but now that I have watched this I can say that I now want to see the other seasons! This series will make you think deeply and see the cosmos in a whole new way. The series brings up many concepts and ideas that I would have not thought of, and if you are like me, always looking for something to push you further, this series will do just that! This is a well done series that will open your eyes and your mind!

6448430,5,B00KU3Y4JA,"Season 4 continues the greatness of Morgan Freeman loaded with information from numerous theoretical physicists, neurobiologist's, engineers etc. I highly recommend all seasons of this series, especially if Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' was just not enough.",1411862400,6,273,6.0256410256410255

6448434,5,B00KU3Y4JA,"A fantastic show rooted in science and factual evidence. The best parts of this show are how Morgan Freeman hosts each episode and the variety of topics that actual scientific researchers are currently exploring.

6448439,5,B00KU3Y4JA,"It made me angry that in spite of repeatedly asking ""When is this coming out in Bluray?"" Neither the Discovery Channel OR Amazon would answer my question- and I started this since October, 2014.  Finally in anguish and disgust- since I own seasons 1-3 on Bluray- I reluctantly ordered the DVD version only to discover that the quality was of Bluray.

Good going, Discovery and Amazon.  Both of you have NO idea of your own production capability.",1432512000,4,445,4.753246753246753

8661690,5,B00KU3Y4JA,"If you are at that stage of spiritual/intellectual development where you have begun to really think critically, wondering if Descartes was right, wondering how deep the rabbit hole goes, and are not easily upset by having conventional modes of believing disrupted, then these shows are a great first stepping stone for you. Please bear in mind as you are watching, however, that the History Channel is part of the mainstream media (this fact carries with it many implications and things to consider). If you are creative in your process, and really investigate each lead presented in Through the Wormhole in as many ways and from as many angles as possible (you will have to dig a little and risk public ridicule), then your path to wherever you are bound awaits...",1531353600,,765,4.892307692307693
