5668245,3,B00BR1NF7Q,"This movie had all the potentials of being one of those great movies about a guy who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. For the most part, the guy did a great job, trying to act innocent and sweet but suddenly flicking a switch and turning into someone you don't want to be near when he's angry. However, the Taylor Spreitler just didn't give enough emotion for my liking. I wanted this movie to be alot more like the movie Fear with Reese Witherspoon. It was a good movie but didn't elicite the emotional connection from me that i was hoping for. A movie that can get your pulse racing is definitely good and this one just didn't do it for me.",1389484800,,652,4.224
5668246,1,B00BR1NF7Q,"The only actors that showed any real emotion during the movie was the seventeen year old's parents.

The only thing that I could think of as to how the other actors got their parts was knowing someone in the movie business.

You would be terrified if someone pointed a gun at you and kidnapped you and your child not knowing what was going to happen next.

It might have been a better movie if the two leading characters had different actors to play them to show SOME kind of emotion.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Keep your money in your pocket or use it to buy something else.",1380672000,,592,4.3545454545454545
5668247,4,B00BR1NF7Q,"Very interesting and thought provoking.  You can really see the emotions from both stalker and the stalked.
  Could be used as a cautionary tale.",1372204800,,145,4.958333333333333
5668248,2,B00BR1NF7Q,"This could have been so much better, a good cautionary tale, had the acting and writing not been so horrible.  Too bad.",1369958400,,119,4.409090909090909
5668249,5,B00BR1NF7Q,"A typical Lifetime Channel movie, Stalked at 17, directed by Doug Campbell (Accused at 17, Walking the Halls), paints an interesting picture of teenage issues in American society today.

Angela (Taylor Spreitler) is a bright high school student. As most girls her age tend to do, she and her best friend Tenaya (Shavon Kirksey) meet Curt (Patrick Alan Davis) and Chad (Chuck Hittinger) while at school one day - although Curt and Chad are actually college students. Chad exhibits the 1-dimensional male creepiness of most Lifetime Movie Antagonists, and he and Angela begin a short romance.

Manipulating Angela with a childhood sob story (which, no surprise, we later find out is mostly made up), Chad manages to get into the young girl's pants, impregnating her in the process - on purpose.

Upon finding out, Angela and Tenaya are pretty distraught (well, especially Angela!), the two girls sitting in a bedroom with a multitude of home pregnancy tests - just to make sure.

Chad is hell-bent on marrying Angela, having the baby, and raising a family.

To the credit of writers Christine Conradt and Kathleen Mattison, Chad's backstory is fleshed out, and we do learn some of the truth of his childhood, which explains pretty well why he is the person he's come to be.  We certainly come to understand more of what makes him tick.  Can we empathize?  I'm sure many can.  Can we sympathize?  I think a little.  Chad's extraordinary drive for family is not a bad thing.  It is a young man grasping for something he's longed for his entire life.  We see that, and in some instances, we see the pain.  But overall, Chad is a broken person who needs fixing but instead blames the world for his horrible life.  Do we like him?  Some might see the good in him, others might not.  Is he a likable guy?  No.  Do we understand why he isn't likable?  Yes.  I didn't expect even this bit of depth, so seeing it was at least a small, pleasant surprise.

The movie raises interesting concerns, such as the issues of absent (and perhaps absent-minded) parents (Chad's biological mother is released from prison in the second act of the movie), teenage pregnancies, and consensual but statutory rape (a 21- and 16-year-old in this case, a moral / legal entanglement in Western culture worth exploring in story).  The two former issues take precedence in the script, while the latter's consequences are touched on briefly, as that particular area wasn't where the story needed to go anyway.

In the end, we see two kids and their parents struggle through a difficult situation.  We see Chad deal with extenuating circumstances brought on by the recklessness and carelessness of his own actions, traits clearly taken right from his mother.  On the flip side, we see Angela, although a curious, gullible young girl, also dealing with these circumstances, but in a more responsible way, mirrored in her parents as well.

Perhaps the movie is painting a picture of how important parents are in their children's lives, fleshing out a scenario for both sides of the fence in this script, the good and the bad. Props to the cast and crew for doing so. Does the movie succeed in getting its message across?  I believe so.",1369872000,7,3198,4.786496350364963

5668273,1,B00BR1NF7Q,"Because in the entire movie, they keep saying she's 16 (but the actress was actually 20 when this movie was made). This movie started out with some apparent promise. As it progressed, I had hoped it would live up to that. Sadly it didn't. The acting was fair, but the girl's parents (and other people) didn't act like compassionate normal human beings. I could understand being angry at the guy who got their daughter pregnant, but in real life, you would at least talk to him and try to get to know him, -for the sake of the child. No humanity in these people though. As in many cases, I might attempt to give it two stars; but I need to knock it down to reality. There are too many people who have mistakenly given it good reviews. Read the two star review by ""K. Harris"". That fairly well sums it up.",1472169600,2,803,4.2894736842105265

5668275,5,B00BR1NF7Q,Sometimes I wonder about people giving reviews on movies here. It's as if they expect every movie to be the same as a billion dollar block buster. Sure this movie didn't have mega stars and a perfect plot line but it was a decent flick to watch and hit's home to anyone who has a teenage daughter. Creepy guys like this really do exist and seeing a film about them is always a good thing. Overall I liked it. Then ending could have been more flashy for those with lower intellect but it was good for me. Life is not always flashy like Hollywood.,1471737600,,545,4.25

5668279,4,B00BR1NF7Q,"If you are a fan of a good Lifetime thriller, then this is the movie for you. It is filled to the brim with enough paternity drama, kidnapping, unexpected pregnancy, mother/daughter bonding to keep you thoroughly entertained for it's brief 90 minutes. Stalked At 17, naturally based on true events, tells the story of high school student Angela who falls for 21-year-old Chad.

Chad, abandoned by his drug-addict mother, when he was four years old, has a great deal of family issues to sort out, and is clearly in no position to be starting a family of his own. When Angela becomes pregnant with Chad's child, all hell breaks loose, as Chad's aggression begins to show. Angela's parents naturally pull her away from him, only making matters worse. Will Angela and her infant son survive this disturbing affair? You'll have to check out Stalked At 17 to find out.

While the film may not be perfect in every regard, it is certainly an entertaining hour and a half, with very good performances throughout. Taylor Spreitler, who plays Angela, gives a very authentic feel to her adolescent angst, and is a very likable heroine.

Overall, Stalked At 17, is an engaging tale of regret, obsession, and deceit, with Angela and Chad both playing for keeps. If you're a fan of suspenseful Lifetime movies, you will definitely enjoy this one.",1470960000,,1331,4.828947368421052

5668287,2,B00BR1NF7Q,"Lifetime movie quality (or lack thereof). Hackneyed plot, trite dialogue, predictable every step of the way.

All of a sudden the girl wants nothing to do with the babies father (even after she professes her love for him).  Most guys out of wedlock run the other way.  Chad, the father actually wants to raise the baby, and loves the mother, hmmm is that so bad?  I think the fact that the girl, the girls parents and even his adoptive mother turning against him, would drive anyone over the edge.
