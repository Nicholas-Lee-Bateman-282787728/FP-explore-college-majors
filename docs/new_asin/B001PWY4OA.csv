3762094,4,B001PWY4OA,"i was able to get this with free super saver shipping from a third party so i paid a 1/3 of what amazon is asking, therefore i feel it was a fair price, but i would probably would have felt a little disappointed had i of paid full price. the movie is super cute and it tells you how each of the furious five(snake, mantis, tigeress, monkey, crane) all became the super heroes they are through the storytelling of panda. panda is in charge of teaching a new generations of kids(bunnies) the art of kung fu and he starts by telling them how their heroes became masters of kung fu. the movie is only 24 minutes which is think isn't long enough to be asking almost the full price of a normal dvd. if you can get this at a discount i would say go for it if your kids love it. mine do and theyve watched this over and over.",1266796800,8,817,4.080745341614906
3762095,5,B001PWY4OA,My kids (5 and 7) were into Kung Fu Panda so this was something they really wanted.  They both love it and it is one of the DVDs we keep in our car.  It is short so it is great for shorter trips when you don't want to throw a full length movie on.  It is a must for Kung Fu Panda fans.,1264809600,2,285,3.492063492063492
3762096,4,B001PWY4OA,"DVD was in great condition.  Just like new.  I did have to wait over 3 weeks to receive it, but I think that was a postal issue, since we have expreienced those before.",1259280000,,168,4.0606060606060606
3762097,3,B001PWY4OA,"I ordered this because my 5 year old loves Kung Fu Panda and reading the reviews of this one I thought he was going to love it
but he saw it only once and never again in two months, maybe latter he'll like it. BTY I love Kung Fu Panda too.",1252713600,,239,3.7058823529411766
3762098,5,B001PWY4OA,"This is a great little video for children who need to remember to practice the ""secrets"".  My grandson loves it and only needs a gentle reminder to ""practice the secrets of the furious five"".  Highly recommended!",1239926400,3,212,4.861111111111111
3762099,5,B001PWY4OA,"My kids love this DVD, more than the actual Kung Fu Panda DVD.  I think they relate more to the characters, especially Tigress who is presented as a child who needs to learn to control her temper.  Then of course there's the narrative frame of Po teaching children their first kung fu class.  What can I say?  Kids like to see other kids.  It also helps that there are 5 short stories told, so they don't have to stay involved in the long story arc of a feature length film.

From a parent's perspective, there's still a bunch of fighting and violence depicted in this movie, but the point of the stories is to learn a virtue, not to be a great fighter (although, naturally, in the movie it is the virtue itself that propels the character into becoming a great fighter - nothing's perfect LOL).

We bought Kung Fu Panda as a single disc - now it is often bundled with The Secrets of the Furious Five.  I was happy to see Secrets as a single to buy because I didn't want to re-buy KFP just to get it.  This DVD is a keeper, so far. My kid is watching it and playing with her stuffed Po and Tigress toys right now.",1239408000,6,1112,4.183098591549296
3762100,5,B001PWY4OA,"A family fun DVD for the fans of ""KUNG FU PANDA"" comes ""SECRETS OF THE FURIOUS FIVE"", a DVD that features a new animated short film and various special features that will teach your children to draw a major character from the film, teach you how to do the Panda dance and feature games, learning various Kung Fu moves and more!

For the 24-minute animated short, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has ""Kung Fu Panda"" hero Po (Jack Black) train a group of youngsters about Kung Fu.  A lot of the kids just are antsy and want to fight immediately and some who lack confidence. Of course, teaching these youngsters is not going to be easy but Po's up to the task.

What better way to train the children but by Po telling the children the history of each of the Furious Five and how at the beginning, they had their issues before becoming the heroes that they are now.

Mantis's storyline is how he was always thinking ahead and thus, he wasn't focusing on what he was being told and this got him into a few troubles but how he managed to overcome his personal obstacle.

Viper's storyline is about how she was born without any fangs or venom and her father felt bad because he would have to continue to protect the family and for Viper, she can excel in her dancing.  But one day, an enemy has found a way to prevent from Viper's father from using his fangs and thus leaving Viper to defend her father using her techniques.

Tigress's storyline was about a tiger who lived in an orphanage, many parents didn't want to adopt her because she was too strong and had a temper.  But how Shifu used patience and trained Tigress to become a warrior.

Monkey's storyline is how he was hurt in the past and thus started out hurting others with his mischief.  Given a second chance, Monkey eventually started helping people and becoming a hero.

Crane's storyline focuses how he was a janitor and never taken seriously to undergo Kung Fu training but eventually had the confidence to show that he can be a great Kung Fu fighter.

Overall, the animated film was a fun and the short story manages to keep the fun and enjoyability from the film intact.  Despite the DVD running time being at 24 minutes long, the numerous special features add to the running time considerably.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""SECRETS OF THE FURIOUS FIVE"" is featured in Widescreen 1:78:1 for the animated feature.  With some parts being CG animated, the main storyline of Po talking about each of the furious five are featured in animated format with a painting visual style. The colors are quite vibrant and colorful.

As for audio, audio is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and 2.0 Surround.  Most of the audio is primarily dialogue and music which comes clearly through your front channel speakers.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Although the main feature on the DVD is 24-minutes long, there are a good number of features that are quite lengthy.  Included are:

  * Learn to Draw - This featurette features how the storyboard artists and artists teaching the viewer how to draw Po and each member of the Furious Five via sketching the characters one-by-one.  For example, with Po, the artist would start off with two circles and explain by detail of drawing the rest of the body and features.  Each segment varies in time but most are around 6 minutes long.  Very informative.
  * Dumpling Shuffle -  This game is your typical shuffle game with three cups and one item is inside one of those cups.  Using your remote to choose which cup has the item.
  * Pandamonium Activity Kit - This segment requires a DVD drive on your PC as you can install demos for the ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""Madagascar 2' video games.

  * Animals of Kung Fu Panda - A featurette that showcases the animals of Kung Fu Panda and it's significance in Kung Fu about how certain moves were developed by watching how these insects and animals would defend and fight and humans adapting the moves to Kung Fu.
  * What Fighting Style Are You? - For those not familiar with Kung Fu, this featurette shows the various Kung Fu moves courtesy of children who have practiced Kung Fu and showcasing the Panda, Snake, Tiger, Monkey, Mantis and Crane Kung Fu movements.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For parents with children, especially those who loved ""KUNG FU PANDA"", ""SECRETS OF THE FURIOUS FIVE"" is a fun, family DVD that features the animated story but also plenty of special features.  It was great to see the various Kung Fu styles and also to see how various characters were drawn and it was great the artist is drawing in real time and explaining the sketches while drawing.

Again, although listed at 24 minutes (for the animated story), the numerous special features are around 3-6 minutes each, so children will definitely be kept busy trying to learn to draw, learning to dance or even playing the video games included on the DVD.

Overall, ""SECRETS OF THE FURIOUS FIVE"" is enjoyable, fun and definitely packed with a good amount of special features for the whole family to enjoy.  For it's low price point, it's a DVD worth checking out!",1237766400,31,5511,4.590583418628454

3762102,5,B001PWY4OA,"Ever wondered about the backgrounds of the Furious Five and how they became Kung Fu masters?  Well wonder no more.  To teach a class of young rabbits that Kung Fu isn't just about fighting, Po tells them the backgrounds of each of the Furious Five; each story emphasizing one aspect of Kung Fu other than fighting. Each of them came from a different background and was led into Kung Fu for different reasons.  Recommended for fans who want to know more about their favorate characters.",1402099200,,485,4.682352941176471

There's laughter, excitement, togetherness, all sorts of wonderful traits to this movie but most of all it ROCKS. You'll love it too if you like the Panda movies.",1369353600,,322,3.893939393939394

3762107,3,B001PWY4OA,"Just be sure you know its not a full length movie.  Its cute how the bunnies wanted Po to tell more and that Po was a good teacher after all.  The kids, 5yrs, didn't like Tigress so much since she was very destructive and seemed scarey until you found out the ""monster"" was a little tiger.  But lead up was a bit scarey.  Lots of hitting and punching, but its a kung fu movie.  Very cute way to learn about the beginnings of these characters.  I could watch a whole movie about monkey or viper.  Animation the same as movie so it is very good, just too short... I wanted more of it! If kids are little, its a good one to pop in and say....after this brush your teeth! And it will be a fast one!",1356048000,,694,4.021897810218978
3762108,4,B001PWY4OA,"I was slightly disappointing because I was expecting it to be one episode for EACH of the furious five not all crammed into one! >.< I feel like they could have taken the story a little more in depth, especially if they have made it into several episodes. I especially thought monkey's story was lacking and neglected, especially in comparison to Viper and Tigress' stories... and the animation was not as up to par as the movie but that's not really that big of a deal.

On the other hand it was adorable! It was great to know the backgrounds of the furious five and I especially loved Tigress' story and it actually can help make some connections in King Fu Panda 2! Very cute, great for kids and kung fu panda fans a like!!",1336694400,,726,4.377777777777778

3762111,3,B001PWY4OA,"This item is not worth the money charged for it.  For the length of the video, it should have been added as a special feature to the original Kung Fu Panda dvd.",1313971200,,160,4.0
3762112,4,B001PWY4OA,Es un disco el cual no ha llegao a mi pais... bueno y recomendado para el coleccionista de la saga...,1312848000,,101,4.1
3762113,4,B001PWY4OA,"After all the hype, I expected more for my money - it wasn't worth what I paid at Wal-mart. However, I did like the video. Here's the problem I had - it's presented as one movie, but it is not a real continuous story for the whole disk. Instead it is Po telling the stories of the Furious Five to a bunch of little kids he has to teach. It seemed to me like 5 ""shorts"" and not a single story. That's why I only gave 4 stars. Others may not feel the same.

I recommend it because it retains the fun, the chinese culture, the good moral lessons, and is true to the characters as seen in the first movie...as kids themselves.

It is also fun to learn the Kung Fu Panda dance, a disk extra.

Buy on sale and have fun.",1309046400,,713,3.972027972027972
3762114,3,B001PWY4OA,This product was not what I expected it to be.  The length of the movie is not even 30 minutes long!  I expected it to be a full length movie.  But it did arrive on time and in pristine condition.,1295913600,,196,3.85
3762115,1,B001PWY4OA,"my son loved the original full lenght movie, Kung Fu Panda.
The previews hawked 'Secrets' as 'Po's next greatest adventure'.

Pardon my assumption, but I kind of expected another full length movie.
Instead it was all of 20 minutes of content, consisting of 2 minute vignettes
of key scenes from each of the furious five's previous lives.

I'd return it if i could. I feel like it was a cheap trick.",1295654400,,398,4.591549295774648

3762118,3,B001PWY4OA,"The preview of this made it seem like it was going to be really cool. The actual movie ""Secrets of the Furious Five"" was only 30 minutes and the rest of the DVD is filled with extra features that seemed geared toward young kids (that would be fine if I were not 19 years old). I was excited about the drawing feature because I thought it was going to be an actual person who drew the character drawing it and talking about it but it was just a narrator that filled in lines on the screen that made the character. I really liked the move portion but the rest I could have done without",1292889600,,583,4.12280701754386

But only got commentary of Po the Panda telling you how each of the furious five (Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Snake and Mantis) all became the super heroes they are. The introduction was very misleading and the DVD is only 24 minutes. Although, Tigress is my favorite hero in this movie and she is really cute. I got bored in watching it and it sure was not worth the money that I paid for it.
