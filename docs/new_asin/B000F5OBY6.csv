VAnder Laan's interpretations in ""The Promise Kept"" are ones that are not found in any of the commentaries and exegetical studies I checked.  That is why I would like foot notes, especially for the marriage proposal/Last Supper comparison.",1459296000,,293,5.212765957446808

8117766,5,B000F5OBY6,"That the World May Know Series (now twelve volumes in number and, prayerfully, counting) is a profoundly moving and highly instructive series on 'on site' lessons within the Holy Land, upon the sites where Jesus Christ, and those others whose lives and ministries are illuminated within the pages of the Bible, lived, worked, walked, laughed, cried and taught, providing the insight to the culture, the times, the geography, life situations, and circumstances in which they were so fashioned, that the message conveyed to all who would accept it, would remain alive within their very lives and surroundings; as such, recapturing these settings, Ray Vander Laan provides to us the intent and symbology which those who spoke with God's Voice, had passionately intended.  Some scriptures will gain a new depth, others will gain new aspects/facets which we were unaware comprised the 'whole picture', while others will gain such an impressive new emphasis, which up till now, had not been available to us because we have not lived during those times, and in those places, yet in this 'new hearing' imparting a new message to lift our heart, delight our mind, sustain the body, both humble and encourage the soul, and further illuminate our path walking in the steps of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For many, like myself, too ill or otherwise unable to make the journey to join those fortunate ones experiencing this lectures series in person, this serves as 'the next best thing', and a profound blessing and a deeply moving (to the point of tears in many cases) testiment and testimony to our hearts, minds, and souls, of the Tremendous Truth and Living Love of our wonderful Lord God.
I have watched these lessons countless times; they never get old (how could God's Message get old?), and my wife and I have given or loaned out many copies through the years to others who were similarly blessed.
My review for each volume of this series will remain unchanged for each and every one, for any indepth review will be inadequate to convey that which is contained within; like someone who sees a work of art who does not have the words to adequately describe, or to do justice to, this masterpiece, all I can do is urge you to come and partake of this blessing and let the scriptures come alive within you once again!",1328227200,4,2305,4.820707070707071

8117768,5,B000F5OBY6,Video was great and it opened a great discussion among the bible study on the early church.,1271462400,,91,4.411764705882353
8117769,5,B000F5OBY6,We used this for the program for our 5-couple small group that meets monthly in our homes.  It's comparison of the Last Supper to a marriage proposal of that day is particularly interesting.  Matches the fine quality of Vander Laan's other productions.  Would recommend.,1235865600,6,270,5.090909090909091
