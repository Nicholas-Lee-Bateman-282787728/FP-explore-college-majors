In fact, you won't find very much mystery, either, as several of the most significant UFO events in Soviet history are quickly and reasonably debunked by James Oberg (UFO skeptic and a leading authority on the Soviet/Russian space program).  What you will get is some basic information on the secret joint investigation by the Soviet military and Academy of Science that ran from 1978 to 1991.  Journalist and investigator George Knapp was able to speak to the leader of that investigation in the early post-glasnost era, but about the only decent information he gives us here is the leader's admission that five to ten percent of the sightings the team investigated could not be explained.

The video touches on several significant possible UFO events in Soviet history.  The first, of course, is Tunguska.  On June 30, 1908, in this most remote of Siberian regions, something fell from the sky with a force one thousand times greater than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The blast, which was heard up to 1000 miles away, leveled trees for a radius of twenty miles and unleashed enough radioactivity to alter the genetic makeup of certain plants in the area.  It was strange to hear speculation about this being a UFO event, as it has now been pretty well established that the impact was caused by a comet or meteor exploding a few miles above the ground.  Moving on, one of the more interesting Soviet UFO sightings occurred in late 1977; dubbed the Petrozavodsk Jellyfish UFO, this case was actually the impetus for Institute 22, the once-secret, 13-year inquiry into Soviet UFOs.  There is an irony in this because the government knew that the stunning sightings over Petrozavodsk originated with atmospheric effects caused by the nearby launch of the Kosmos 955 satellite - or so James Oberg tells us.  Let us put our hopes on the juiciest of stories from 1982, when a Soviet nuclear missile suddenly switched to launch mode at the same time that a UFO was reported overhead.  Fifteen panic-stricken seconds later, the missile just as suddenly switched back to normal mode.  This nuclear incident remains a mystery, but we learn that the reported UFO can be explained as the flares from a nearby military exercise.

There is some speculation that Stalin may have shown an interest in UFOs in the late 1940s, but the post-war era is largely a story of the Soviet government's explicit ban on any discussion or investigation of UFO sightings.  Indeed, the government's one attempt to allow such discussion, ostensibly for the purpose of diverting attention away from the true source of mysterious objects being seen in southern Soviet skies, was quickly reversed as the evidence scientists were compiling revealed too much information on secret Soviet military test firings of a new and illegal rocket.  In the end, this underground history of Soviet ufology proved to be the most interesting aspect of this whole story, especially given the fact that most of the individual UFO stories discussed are rather credibly debunked.  That wasn't what I expected out of this documentary (especially given some of the wild stories I've heard out of Russia), and so I daresay that those looking for truly unexplained, humdinger UFO incidents may find this to be a rather disappointing video.",1296691200,,3437,4.980769230769231
