6517192,5,B00M08RNRS,I don't think that blacks will ever understand the detrement that irresponsible sex plays in our culture. We have come to accept it as normal and so our children don't even try to do things differently.,1414540800,2,202,4.638888888888889

8669261,3,B00M08RNRS,"Conservative Black (and White) America will like this film since it reinforces the idea that African Americans are somehow choosing to have children they can't afford and can't take care of. I think the stories presented need to be told.  But I was struck by the fact that there wasn't a SINGLE  sociologist included among the ""experts"" who discussed the issue of black non-marital childbearing.  Therefore there was little to no discussion of the structural conditions producing this trend, the growth of non-marital childbearing overall (both nationally and globally); the massive unequal sex ratio within the Black community combined with  the reduced opportunities Black women have to date/marry interracially, the decline in childbearing among Black MARRIED women (which explains why the proportion of black babies who are born are to unmarried women), and the varying  access to birth control and abortion  available to Black women.  These are  facets of the issue which, if included in the film would have provided a more comprehensive look at the issue.",1440892800,3,1061,5.311377245508982
8669262,5,B00M08RNRS,AMAZING,1440374400,,7,7.0
8669263,2,B00M08RNRS,Interesting but conclusions were pointing to only one conclusion in this documentary. Well organized and nicely shot with interesting interviews but no protagonist viewpoint or counter argument in any direction. It felt repetitive and really could have been more engaging.,1435190400,,272,5.825
8669264,5,B00M08RNRS,Very good presentation. Price high for length of material.,1433548800,,58,5.555555555555555

8669267,4,B00M08RNRS,"I wish it had gone even further - and interviewed men and women openly with multiple children by varied partners and asked each of them the hard question: ""Why?""  Why are you making these decisions to not practice birth control, safe sex or family planning?  What is your expectation for your children?  The discussions are mostly with professionals and present one story of a hard-working mom.  Perhaps each Black Lives Matters group should place this in their library should they want to take on an actual mission of change within their communities.  Sadly, I just see this number rising in the next decades to where it is the absolute norm.  We have a great black president and his wonderful family for role modeling and yet, some distasteful hip-hop mogul or irresponsible sports figure will lead the pack in misbehavior and people follow along with disastrous effects.  Race relations will never grow warmer as long as there is this awful distinction in where the government welfare is used, and often abused.  It is so easy to pit people against others in poverty when there is a clear presentation of personal irresponsibility. Whatever happened to the mindset regarding population control to aid Mother Earth?",1431475200,3,1217,4.99009900990099
8669268,4,B00M08RNRS,"Good film in some ways. There are quite a few wonderfuly supportive and present black fathers throughout our society. The statistics are very sad, and can explain why we, as a black whole, continue to fail.",1429660800,,206,4.75
8669269,1,B00M08RNRS,"My DVD was defectice so I was not able to view it. I bought 2 of the DVD's---both had the same problem. If you can send me a non defective DVD maybe I will be able to review it.
Thank you kindly

8669270,4,B00M08RNRS,This movie is eye-opening and sad.  It should be part of a national dialogue on the inability of African Americans to form stable families.,1424563200,3,139,4.791666666666667
