4486394,4,B004WD1J24,"I like the intensity of el Cigala and his passionate delivery. I don't like his interpretation of tango as much, but the fusion begins to work when Marconi plays the bandoneon and turns the mood towards tango, the way we understand it today (unlike the original sound of flamenco). Altogether, this is a good DVD to have, and it compensates for being to far fro BA to have being present at the Gran Rex.",1369526400,3,403,4.45945945945946
4486395,5,B004WD1J24,I give five stars to this DVD. Diego El Cigala is a fantastic singer and has the very best musicians and songs.,1352764800,2,111,4.090909090909091

However, I have other Cigala products and trust that the music contained herein is equally fine.  I have yet to open the sealed box and play it.  The only other reviewer gave it a 5 (via Spanish), so that is probably accurate.  My lower rating reflects my great disappointment at the misleading advertising.  I am sure the defendant would hide behind the fact that the text in the ad refers to DVD.  My guess is that 9 out of 10 people are under the impression that Blu Ray is a type of DVD and would thus fall victim to the trap laid by the use of a blu ray box in the advertisement.  I only paid $12.57 plus s&h for it, so I'll just keep it.",1326067200,2,972,4.8545454545454545
