2858408,5,B000R4SKEW,"Anyone who feels there is no way for parties in the Middle East to find a road to peace will be heartened by this film born out of tragedy. But this is a bigger and more important story than what is transpiring in the Middle East. This is a film about grief and and transformation, about choosing the path of peace instead of retribution. Kudos to the Producers for bringing this story to the public. There is hope out there, and the lessons of this film about personal transformation are important lessons for us all.",1189987200,13,518,4.463157894736842

2858410,5,B000R4SKEW,"The Parents-Circle, which is the group this documentary is about is a group of bereaved Israeli AND Palestinian families who each lost a loved one in our ongoing conflict by the 'fault' of the other side. Yet these families succeed to get together, overcoming almost natural feelings of hate or rejection and try to build together a new reality in the Middle East, a new reality which would stop such contious sufferings... You'll see, this experience is absolutely amazing!",1185926400,11,474,5.012658227848101

8198866,4,B000R4SKEW,"That unusual thing; a documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict that manages to be hopeful (if still heartbreaking).

It focuses an various groups' attempts to find way to forge
bonds and end the hatred.

Most touching is the group for bereaved parents from both side of
the conflict who've lost children in the fighting and who come
together to share their pain.

Somehow the film as a whole didn't have quite the overwhelming
emotional impact it seemed to be headed for, but still a very
good, important and worthy documentary.",1311984000,,535,4.98876404494382
8198867,4,B000R4SKEW,"I purchased this video after hearing an interview on the NPR program, ""Speaking of Faith.""  I purchased the video because I was interested in learning more about the stories of these two amazing people, Ali Abu Awad and Robi Damelin.  Ali Abu Awwad is a Palestinian man whose older brother was killed without provocation by an Israeli soldier. Robi Damelin is an Israeli mother whose soldier-son was killed by a Palestinian sniper.  Despite their profound grief and anger over these needless killings, these two people have come together to fight the violence with non-violence, to try and bring peace to a place that seems bound to despair, and to try and turn painful past experiences into motivation for future hope.  After watching, I realized this movie is a wonderful teaching tool for students of the Middle East, whether it is a history class or a religion class.  I used it in a college-level introductory theology class.  This movie makes you think and I bet, regardless of your preconceptions surrounding this topic, your mind will be changed after watching the courageous struggle these people endure in order to bring peace to this region.",1269561600,,1152,4.973958333333333
8198868,4,B000R4SKEW,The scenes with the young Palestinian men were riveting as they argued with each other over exchanging their honor for reconciliation. It reminded me of our human need to say our suffering and death are worthy no matter what the circumstance.  These guys wanted to be noble and admired in the face of losing or they would rather die.  Our nation is the same.  Remember Kissenger's lame proclamation after he negotiated an end to our losses in the Viet Nam war: 'We have peace with honor.'  Gulp.  We need to leave everyone room to save face and be noble or we do not have peace that will last.  This was a very realistic and compelling documentary.  Highly recommended.,1266624000,,669,4.61864406779661
8198869,5,B000R4SKEW,"This documentary was co-produced and directed by Israelis and Palestinians. It presents an in-depth view of efforts by people from both sides toward mutual understanding. Full of stories that we should all hear, but don't. A must-see for anyone interested in peace in the region.",1241049600,3,279,5.222222222222222

8198871,5,B000R4SKEW,"One of the messages of the film makers of ""Encounter Point"" I really like was that the politicians come and go, and people on the ground go through it all all the time.  Another message I liked was that, unlike other documentaries that concentrate on the shocking and the dramatic, we should concentrate on those who are trying to make things better.

""Encounter Point"" is a great documentary about an organization that unites bereaved families in Israel and the Occupied Territories.  Both Israeli and Palestinian families.  Yes, both Jewish and Muslim.  Is that possible?  One would never know it, watching the news and endless portrayals of hatred from that part of the world.  ""Encounter Point"" shows us that it is not only possible, but is, and has been happening.  Amazingly, both Palestinians and Israelis grieve after their fallen and they both want peace.

There will always be sceptics and there will always be Grinches who take away the little hope we have.  My hat is off to the film makers and all the people portrayed in the film, as the process for peace has to start somehow and somewhere.  And these brave people are showing us that one can put behind millenia of hate and competition and peacefully coexist with the rival.  Highly recommended.",1203724800,6,1261,4.841121495327103
8198872,3,B000R4SKEW,"The success of Encounter Point  at Tribeca and other venues is probably due to its attempt not to take sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead, it follows both Israeli and Palestinian members of an unfortunate ""club""---parents who have lost sons and daughters in the hostilities between the warring groups. They have formed a group that is attempting reconciliation among its own members first and then reaching out to bring about understanding on a national scale.

I wanted to write this review objectively, but language insists on a point of view even when summarizing. Israelis would criticize my use of ""conflict"" as too mild a word to describe what they term ""acts of terrorism."" When a Palestinian is shot by an Israeli soldier, I am pro-Israeli if I see it as a casualty of war and pro-Palestinian if I call it murder as Palestinians in the film do). And while I do not describe the group's aims as ""forgiveness,"" ""settlement,"" ""compromise,"" and ""appeasement,"" I do adop the film's use of the term ""reconciliation,"" thereby suggesting equivalency between the two positions, a position I do not not wish to claim.

 The fact is that as any documentary, Encounter Point also takes a position and is unmistakable in its sympathies. Despite that, viewers who disagree with the attitude will still find much to interest them in the film. If the point of view was responsible for its booking, the film's actual interviews are what make it worth seeing. To their credit, if they chose deliberately, and to the credit of their artistic temperament if they chose instinctively, the filmmakers provide unforgettable moments of clarity. A Palestinian member of the group takes the filmmakers to meet his mother in Arab Jerusalem. She urges him to tell the story of his arrest as a young man. He tells of being in a room with two young men who were building bombs. When the bombs exploded prematurely, he too was arrested and imprisoned for a decade.  Interrupts the mother, ""He wasn't even in the room. He was outside, getting a haircut."" The son gently but firmly corrects her, admitting he was in the room but insisting he was minding his own business. What a seminal moment, with mother's love and memory combining to offer a palatable version of events.

A similar moment of clarity emerges during an interview on Israeli television. The group's representative urges Israelis to question the efficacy of a policy toward Palestinians that has created 50 years of hate. The moderator responds by asking the representative to consider the possibility that the hate has no basis, that Palestinians want them dead without a specific provocation. And the representative raises his shoulder in the classic Jewish response that non-verbally says, ""Who knows."" Unfortunately, that shrug of doubt undercuts the optimism that animates the movement toward peace.

Ultimately, the strength of this film does not lie in its hopeful presentation of the group's aims but in its accurate rendition of the group members with all their human sadness, determination, and naivet&eacute;. Their stories, Israeli and Palestinian, are heart rending.",1203638400,12,3137,5.091439688715953
8198873,5,B000R4SKEW,"I highly recommend this excellent documentary portraying the lives
of Palestinians and Israelis willing to say no to violence, and
hear each others pain in the quest for peace. Most of the media
attention in the U.S. is focused on terrorist violence; this film
presents the viewer with the story of families on both sides
of the violence, who have lost family members to the violence,
and yet are reaching out to each other.  These families represent the
seeds of hope and peace for Palestinians and Israelis.  The film was done
with sensitivity and balance, and lots of painful but hopeful honesty.",1190592000,28,599,4.862745098039215
