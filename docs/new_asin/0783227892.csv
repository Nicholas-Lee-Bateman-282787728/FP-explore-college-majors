62268,5,0783227892,"Jean-Claude Van Damme brought HK action movie maestro/legend/icon, John Woo to the US and the results are groundbreaking. Hard Target elevated the US action film from blunt force trauma to a meditation on violence. Woo had already done something similar in HK, but Hard Target differed in the sense that American movie violence was like a 2x4 to the face & HK movie violence came from the more flowing thoughtfulness of karate. Woo was able to combine the two into an incredibly entertaining, wonderfully trashy, yet solidly beautiful, artistry. He would ultimately refine all of this into one of the absolute greatest action films of all time, Face/Off. Now, having said all that, full credit must be given to one of cinema's most underrated action stars: Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme is an artist, w a gifted eye for storytelling. He fought for Woo to be brought to the states to direct Hard Target (doing the sa",1504915200,,918,4.853503184713376

62307,5,0783227892,Get the HD version it has superior picture and sound(this one is LOUD!!!) and it is the uncut international version! Basically it has all the extra violent shots cut by the stupid MPAA(Motion Picture association of Adolf Hitler!) and a some extra dialogue between Van Damme and Henriksen at the end which was very effective and made it darker. The Blu version is cheap and affordable so no reason not to own this! An above average transfer but still no features but the presentation makes up for it and it's uncut! The workprint version still has some violent shots and scenes that are not on here but it's the most complete right at the moment. Highly recommended!,1497484800,2,665,4.6923076923076925

62470,5,0783227892,"This blu ray, despite the R rating, appears to be the slightly longer Euro cut of the film as it includes many of the exit wounds and other violence not in the R rated version that was streaming on Netflix recently - it certainly varies from my US VHS.  That being said, this film does deserve a bigger release some day, there are two workprints floating around I've seen with more violence and subplots - some of that stuff belonged on the cutting room floor as both run over 2 hours, but it would be nice to have an official release.  At any rate, for this price, if you were like me and put off buying this film, I'd break down and give this version a shot.  The movie is the most absurd fun you'll ever have. JCVD kills pretty much everything. It has snake punching and standing on top of motorcycles and driving them into destruction. I mean, there are some many outrageous moments, you'll have to watch it over and over.",1464220800,8,926,4.341040462427745
62471,5,0783227892,"In all honesty, I first heard of this movie while tracking down NC-17 rated movies but never wanted to watch it until I could see it in that version. Luckily, this bluray is the equivalent of that for anyone who wants to know. What I didn't expect was to enjoy this movie like I did!

John Woo's brilliance is not lost in American translation, as we still get kickass action scenes, doves flying, slow-motion, etc. The plot is like a take on ""The Most Dangerous Game"" to the action maximum, as Van Damme tries to take down a criminal hunting club of sorts that hunts down homeless war veterans. Don't want to spoil anything else about the plot, but there are some genuinely well done scenes in this film, especially for an action film.

For people who love harder action movies, and people who just generally like to have a good time and watch good films.",1462752000,2,855,4.4743589743589745

62504,5,0783227892,"John Woo's first American feature film was almost sabotaged by JCVD who, according to various sources, acted as a heavy-handed editor and insisted that Woo's trade-mark bullet ballet was pared down to a bare minimum. There was talk of an uncut director's version out there on the gray market somewhere, and I actually acquired a very poor quality work-print DVD-R which ran around 2:07. The action was on par with ""Hard Boiled,"" multiple bullet hits missing in the theatrical cut, more Lance Henriksen (yeah!).  Much to my surprise and delight, the current Blu-ray is almost the director's cut, minus an ill-advised love scene between JCVD and Yancy Butler.

62512,4,0783227892,"BOTTOM LINE: This film certainly won't win any awards for its script or acting, but for balls-to-the-wall action fans John Woo's HARD TARGET is a pretty solid choice, and remains one of the better bare-knuckled titles on Jean-Claude's rough & ready resume. 4 STARS

THE STORY: Former soldiers are hunted for sport in this thinly-veiled reworking of 1987's DEADLY PREY, 1992's DEATH RING, and of course the great-granddaddy of all ""hunting people for sport"" movies, 1932's THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. Jean-Claude Van Damme stars in this John (The Killer) Woo-directed actioner as Chance Boudreaux, an out of work ex-Marine Force Recon soldier eeking out a living in New Orleans as a merchant sailor. He becomes involved in the barbaric human trafficking/trophy hunting plot when he crosses paths with a young girl who arrives in town trying to locate her ex-Vietnam vet father. Turns out dear old dad was just found dead, the most recent player in a deadly contest where homeless ex-combat veterans are tempted with the promise of $10,000 cash if they're willing to be live game for ultra-rich types yearning for something more sporting to hunt than the usual four-footed quarry.

THOUGHTS: Jean-Claude must've wiped out an entire 55 gallon drum of Dippity-Doo to keep his lethal mullet in check for this motion picture; certainly one of the stronger movies of his career. HARD TARGET is an extremely thick-headed but also undoubtedly well concocted action-fest; an early-90's entree in the ""blowed up real good"" action-hero heyday of films cranked out in the early-1980's to mid-1990's. Remember those? You know, where every object hit with a bullet blows up with the explosive force of a stick of dynamite, the guns have bottomless clips and heroes are all but superhuman, capable of wiping out half the bad guys on Earth without breaking a sweat - unless it makes them look cool. Ahhh... those were the days!  Anyhow, in this amazing film we are treated to prolific, craggy-faced character actor Lance (I can do this part in my sleep) Hendrickson playing villainous Emil Fouchon, a psychotic sleezebag who, for an outrageous fee, arranges the savage one-sided manhunts. He plays the role with gruff bellowing gusto but looks so bug-eyed and pinch-faced throughout the entire film that he comes across like a man who hasn't had a good bowel movement since Nixon was in office. Cuckoo-eyed Arnold Vasloo adds his hammy charm playing gleefully unhinged Pik van Cleef, the lethal but loony sidekick of Hendrickson's character. And finally, Wilford Brimley rounds out the lead cast as Chance's lovable moonshine-making uncle Douvee, channeling Justin ""the Cajun cook"" Wilson and assaulting our ears with what is perhaps THE worst Cajun accent in the history of ever. (""Hoo, I garowntee dat!"")

Hong Kong action-meister extraordinaire John (THE KILLER, HARD BOILED) Woo directs this wall-to-wall punch & kick hooplah. Strangely, Woo's attempts to replicate his hometown success here in the States were uneven and shaky, at best. This film, along with FACE-OFF and BROKEN ARROW remain his best American-made efforts. His absolutely unique, uber-violent, over-the-top directorial style (for better or worse) influenced a generation of up & coming young directors, all eager to clone Woo's operatic, wholly hyper-excessive cinematic bloodfests. He plays his entire hand of trademark cards in HARD TARGET, too: the 2-gun kid mode, leaping through mid-air firing a zillion rounds, lots of stylish slow motion scenes, and poetic flapping bird shots galore. HARD TARGET features a nice use of urban & rural locations in and around New Orleans, adding to the unique look of the film, while a zydeco-flavored bluesy soundtrack colors the movie with authentic bayou character. The brutal fight choreography & explosive pyrotechnics (and there are TONS of both) are all expertly done, helping kick this otherwise routine blood 'n' bullets entry up several notches. If you're looking for a stereotypically macho action film, (with a few silly asides), that also happens to sport truly artistic visual flare, then HARD TARGET is a rockin' good flick to pick.

THE BLU-RAY: The hi-def Blu for HARD TARGET is a barebones effort, but at least it offers a clean picture & strong, level soundmix. Picture is crisp for the most part, with only minimal artifacting & pixelation. Compression isn't much of an issue nor is overuse of DNR, thankfully. Color palette is well-represented and filmgrain is evident. Sadly, the only bonus feature is the film's theatrical trailer. Bummer.",1449187200,6,4553,5.189115646258504

62554,5,0783227892,"Hard Target was John Woo's first U.S. film and one of Jean-Claude Van Dammes best in my opinion. Youve got the good guy Jean Claude Van Damme looking as fit as can be, surrounded by a great cast of villains played by Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo. While the storyline may not be unique, the action sequences and fast paced direction of John Woo make this one heck of an entertaining movie.

Hunting humans for sport, where have I seen this storyline before? There have been a number of solid movies made over the years where humans are hunted down and killed for sport. As I write my review for Hard Target (1993) a number of similar films come to mind. The Most dangerous Game (1932) Turkey Shoot (1982) Avenging Force (1986) Surviving the Game (1994) and The Running Man (1987)  Heres my review of Universals Hard Target Blu-ray released Oct 13, 2015 running 1 hr 40 minutes.

A young woman named Natasha Binder travels to New Orleans in search of her father and finds out he is missing. She files a missing persons report but little help comes of it. Desperate to find her father Douglas Binder, she enlists the help of a drifter named Chance Boudreaux to help her find him. Boudreaux helps Natasha unravel the mystery surrounding her fathers death and together they realize theres more going on in New Orleans then they bargained for. Welcome to Hard Target!

Blu-ray Quality
4.5/5
This newly released Blu-ray from Universal definitely doesnt disappoint in terms of picture quality. The new 1080p high-definition 1:85.1 transfer from Universal looks fantastic, a huge improvement over the previous DVD version. The picture is sharp and colors are vibrant. In my opinion, this is the best Hard Target has ever looked and I couldn't find anything wrong with the picture at all.

Audio Quality
4.7/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack absolutely rocks! The dialogue came through my home theatre system crisp and clean but its the action sequences that take this Blu-ray to a whole new level. I don't know what tweaking if any went into the audio for this Blu-ray but it sounds incredible and every explosion, shoot-out and John Woo action sequence is clearly on display. It doesnt hurt that the soundtrack music is from Graeme Revell either. I couldn't hear anything wrong with the soundtrack at all.

62609,4,0783227892,"What's not to love about Hard Target? It's one of the best in Jean-Claude Van Damme's oeuvre (and if you come across the uncut version, all the better). Sure, it's super-cheesy and incredibly over-the-top and were you to critique the thing, there surely is plenty of fodder. And, yet, time has been kind to Hard Target, and I find so many things to cherish about it: JCVD's boss mullet; JCVD's punching the crap out of that rattlesnake; Arnold Vosloo's menacing ""Randal, I come back here, I cut me a steak""; the cool bluesy soundtrack; Wilford Brimley's crazy cajun accent...

JCVD is blacklisted merchant seaman Chance Boudreaux, wayward son of New Orleans who has drifted home, sporting a black trenchcoat to confound the sweltering heat. Chance, in dire need for cash, agrees to act as local guide to Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) as she searches for her long-estranged, ex-military dad. Bad time to do this as the police has gone on strike.

- Fouchon: ""It has always been the privelege of the few to hunt the many... Men who kill for the government do so with impunity. Now all we do is offer the same oportunity for private citiens.""

Chance and Natasha quickly run afoul of the entrepreneur Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) whose enterprise consists of organizing urban safaris for his deep-pocket clientele. And their quarry? Down-and-out combat veterans with no family left to come asking questions later. We know that Fouchon is a thoughtful businessman because he also provides his customers airtight out-of-town alibis. Not too long before Fouchon targets Chance Boudreaux, himself a Silver Star-decorated Marine Force Recon, as a prime candidate for one of his savage man hunts.

Hard Target came out in 1993, a period when JCVD was still very much a viable box office attraction. Hard Target is also John Woo's inaugural Hollywood picture, and he made sure to flood the screen with his signature moves. We're exposed again to his fixation on white doves (seriously, what is that about?) and a profile shot of two hombres with their backs braced against opposite sides of a wall as they get set to shoot the hell out of each other. And for those who champion the belief that there isn't nearly enough of JCVD doing a slo-mo power walk towards the screen, well, this film is your huckleberry. Listen, Woo is inarguably one of cinema's great stylists. I even love his excesses, and that's all here. Without Woo's boss technique, Hard Target could have easily been 1993's cinematic armpit.

JCVD does what JCVD does best. He delivers severe asswhuppings to sundry goons and minions. As usual, his line delivery sucks. But his helicopter kick remains a thing of beauty. JCVD and John Woo working in concert is like a wet dream for fans of martial arts cinema. Woo puts in fantastic flourishes to the numerous action set pieces, never mind that there's a lot in them that don't make sense (JCVD balancing on a motorcycle, what?). It's style over substance, but it's John Woo's style, and that trumps any plot holes you can conceive. Although, I've one gripe that even Woo's impressive bells and whistles can't surmount: What's up with the mullet?

With JCVD's habit of virtuoso non-acting, you must surround him with credible actors. Yancy Butler isn't really that, but she sure looks pretty. But Lance Henriksen is super-solid as the mastermind, even though even he falls prey to excess. It's fun to watch, and it's obvious that Henriksen is having a blast with all the manic mustasche-twirling. Equally alarming is his primary henchman, the South African killer, Van Cleaf (a scene-stealing Arnold Vosloo). I think that Van Cleaf is even more menacing than his boss because he maintains his composure and common sense even as Fouchon surrenders to his impulses in several scenes. Yo, Fouchon, you should've listened to your right hand man when he kept insisting that ""I can take him from the air."" No, you had to be macho and insist on hunting Boudreaux on the ground and thru the Louisiana bayous. Wasn't wise to give Boudreaux a sporting chance and allow him to get to his secret weapon - which is his moonshine-making, bow-and-arrow-wielding, lunatic uncle, Wilford Brimley! So, yeah, son, Hard Target! It's way better than Ice-T's Surviving the Game.",1435968000,,4257,4.922005571030641

Lance Henriksen is not able to steal the show like he usually does because of the lousy script. John Woo saves the day with his slow-mo and overkills. Little known fact-Billy Ray Cyrus was the first choice for the starring role-not really but Van Damme is made up to look just like him (3:00 shadow and mullet). The interesting story has homeless merchant marine Chance (Damme) getting hunted by a bunch of bored rich sportsmen/killers led by fouchon (Henriksen) after he exposes their cat and mouse game of killing the homeless for thrills. After making Van Damme look like Lawrence Olivier, Arnold Vosloo somehow went on to ""darkman"" and even as an A-lister in ""the mummy""-WTF? The bluray from England is the uncut version never seen in the U.S.! The action is totally out of control with most people getting blown away over 10 times each in this NRA approved masterpiece! The other good news is the disc is region free and has no problems on region 1 players and T.V.s here. Woo's original cut is preferred but no release in sight. This bluray is actually JCVD's version as he locked Woo out of the editing room for final cut. 16X9 HD Video and audio blows away the ""R"" rated dvd version.

Such as, 10 guys can be shooting at him (even at reasonably close range) but nobody hits him.

What's more, he acts somewhat like an unapproachable ""I'm above y'all!"", but girls want to talk to him anyway.

62860,4,0783227892,"Ah, 1993... I was in high school, which I hated. Bill Clinton had just been elected, and no one had yet heard of Monica Lewinski. Arnold Schwarzeneggar scored a big flop with Last Action Hero. M.C. Hammer was just coming off of 2 Legit 2 Quit. Oh, and the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was on TV.

So with all that great stuff going on, it's no wonder that I missed Jean-Claude Van Damme's movie that year: Hard Target. Well, I watched it for the first time last weekend and good grief! No wonder I haven't heard of it. It's a pretty bad movie to be sure, but it definitely fun to watch. Plus, it has a few moments of awesome that cannot be denied. It clearly falls into the ""So Bad it's Good"" category.

Here are some of those Awesomely Bad moments. Where else are you going to find JCVD...?

- With a mullet?
- Wearing a single earing in one ear, as only badasses in the early 90's did?
- Wearing a trenchcoat?
- Doing roundhouse kicks in said trenchcoat?
- On horseback with a shotgun?
- Pretending to be a cajun?

Or how about JCVD...

- With Wilford Brimley as his ass-kicking uncle (which automatically turns him into Wilford Brimley, Action Hero)?
- Punching a rattlesnake in the head?
- Biting the tail off the rattlesnake?
- Turning the rattlesnake into a booby trap?
- Balancing on the back of a motorcycle, jumping off the motorcycle onto the top of a van, rolling over the van, landing (safely) on the ground, then turning and shooting the van until it explodes?
- With a pigeon on his shoulder?

And last but not least, JCVD...

- Shooting a guy with a gun being held upside down?
- Kicking a can of gasoline toward a guy, then shooting the can in midair so that it - and the bad guy - bursts into flame.
- Sticking a live grenade down a guy's pants?
- Homeless?
- And doing other wacky action-hero antics?

The mullet deserves special mention, because that is more than just a mullet. That's a Power Mullet. It looks like it's been permed, then imbued with hair gel and mousse, and hand-crafted with love.

Oh yeah, the plot. (It does have one.) In this movie, JCVD stars as ""Chance Broudrieux"" (sp?), a down-on-his-luck and very unlikely cajun living in New Orleans. It also stars Lance Henriksen as the bad guy. He is nice and wicked here. Does a good job of being evil. Other than Wilford Brimley, I didn't recognize anybody else in this movie.

This movie has enough roundhouse kicks to make Chuck Norris proud. Also, they are kind of ridiculous at times. I mean, JCVD will be holding a gun. But he will kick a guy in the face, then shoot him. Why not just shoot him? Why go to all that effort? Or why not just kick him, and not shoot him? Kicking then shooting him seems a bit redundant.

It also used slow motion shots. A lot. It started getting distracting after a while.

One odd thing about this movie is I kept questioning the main character's motivation. This has some seriously bad acting by JCVD. His whole acting schtick here seems to consist of staring blankly and showing no emotion whatsoever. Which is okay I guess, except that he was presented as somewhat of a selfish prick, so I couldn't figure out why he would even be interested in helping the girl here. The movie itself seems to recognize this plot error. At one point, one of the bad guys asks JCVD straight up, ""Why are you helping them? Why get involved?"" He answers, ""Because sometimes even poor people get bored."" Uh. Okay then?

The movie is named ""Hard Target"". But really I think it is more about how bad a shot all the bad guys are. No one can ever hit anything. It should have been named ""Poor Shots"".

A big thanks to my brother for giving me this movie, along with his collection of 6 other JCVD favorites. It was a nice way to waste an hour and a half. But I couldn't honestly recommend it to anyone. Unless you want to play a drinking game, where you all have a shot (a ""Poor Shot""?) every time JCVD does a roundhouse kick, or delivers a bad one-liner, or gets shot at without getting hurt. I think you'd be well on your way to a hangover midway through this movie, and your suffering would still not be over. Enjoy!",1378684800,,4113,4.3524804177545695

62901,5,0783227892,"This is not so much a review as it is more of a mild comparison! This is for the ""import version from the U.K."" (has the red circle with the white number 18 rating, for those who are not familiar). From what I can tell the movie is almost identical to the U.S. version until the ending. The ending of the U.K. version is not nearly as cut up as the U.S. version, and though I haven't compared it to the bootleg director's cut on vhs, the ending of the U.K. version may be the same ending as the director's bootleg cut. There are actually scenes completely missing from the U.S. version that appear on this U.K. version, though not many. A scene involving a guy wearing a motorcycle helmet who gets elbowed and has his gun taken away from him and used on someone else, completely disappears in the U.S. version, but in the U.K. version, after Van Damme kills the man that he used the bikers gun on, the biker gets back up and is killed and another guy behind him is killed as well. The biggest difference between the two endings are the number of times you see someone get shot. For example In the U.K. cut you'll see someone get shot 5 times and then the scene may change. In the U.S. cut, you'll have the same scene where you see 1 or 2 gunshots, and then the scene will change and you'll only hear the rest of the gun shots. This is very evident in the scene where Yancy Butler kills the man chasing her and shooting at her, after he manages to get in front of her, (Woo has always been one to show the gun shooting and the person getting hit with bullets in the same scene, as opposed to most who show the gun shooting and cutting to another scene showing the person geting hit with bullets). The U.K. cut ending is much more distinctly John Woo's style of gun fighting. So in my opinion, the U.K. version is much better as it is more complete and actually makes more sense when you see the difference. The downfalls are three, one is that it has a different region code (2) and is in PAL format, so if you don't have a multi-region dvd player that can also read PAL format, the dvd will not work for you. The second is that it is not as good a quality as the U.S. dvd, though the U.K. version is not bad by any means, just not quite as sharp. The 3rd is that it is not anamorphic if that matters to you. Whenever I watch this fim it will be with the U.K. version simply for the ending that is distinctly John Woo.

Good movies from action stars like Van Damme and Steven Seagal are VERY HARD to find since most of their movies sucks. I understand that Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Universal Soldier, and this one are the best of Van Damme. But Hard Target has EVERYTHING that you want in a Damme action film!

He does his usual routine of kicks, splits, shooting down bad guys without actually aiming at them, and so on. Yancy Butler (who starred in ""WitchBlade""), is quite beautiful but spends most of her screen time with her eyes bulging out of her head, thanks to near escapes. Based on the iconic short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"", you know the ending before the opening credits have finished rolling. But - this is an enjoyable movie. It's relaxing and brainless.

62908,4,0783227892,"It's my belief that when John Woo came to America, Hollywood may have been excited but had no idea what to do with him - or, more aptly, whom to team him up with. Kurt Russell was uninterested, Seagal and Norris were busy doing their own things, and Schwarzenegger would have been a match made in hell, so Jean-Claude Van Damme seems to have been chosen by default. However, the combination made for not only a very strong entry into Van Damme's filmography during his run on top of the mainstream but also arguably the best American film Woo made...aside from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Face-Off/dp/630512762X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Face/Off</a>.

The script is written by Chuck Pfarrer, who penned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkman/dp/0783226012/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkman</a>&nbsp;and would later write a couple&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/graphic-novels/dp/1569713170/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">graphic novels</a>. By large, it's a swell fit for Woo: there's some definite corniness to it and I could've done without quite as much sadism from the villains, but it does a good job of building a balanced movie around a simple idea, like the director's best work. Chance isn't a terribly out-of-the-ordinary character for Van Damme to play, but sticking the French-sounding Muscles from Brussels with a Cajun identity is a nice alternative from the usual born-in-America-raised-in-Europe mug he usually gets stuck with. The standout characters are definitely the villains: enforcer Arnold Vosloo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy/dp/B00000JQB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy</a>) doesn't know karate or look physically intimidating, but he's easily one of the most effectively monstrous henchmen ever seen in a Van Damme movie; and Lance Henriksen is simply brilliant as the cold-hearted merchant of death. Wilford Brimley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing/dp/B0002CHK1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing</a>) appears in the second film half as Chance's moonshine-making uncle and does a good job of endearing himself as the comic relief. The only real questionable character is Yancy Butler's: the woman can act, but Natasha is simply a dummy in distress.

John Woo reportedly turned down several martial arts-themed scripts before finding this one, so there isn't an abundance of hand-to-hand fisticuffs - a shame, considering that the bit there is looks pretty cool; a five-on-one encounter early in the film makes excellent use of sweeps and counter techniques. The rest of the action is made up of pretty decent chase scenes (where else will you see Van Damme fleeing attackers on both a motorcycle and then a horse in the same hour?) and gunplay derivatives from Woo's Hong Kong days. The latter is the one major disappointment the movie offers: the scene in the warehouse - inclusive of the badass bit where Vosloo and Van Damme shoot at eachother from opposite sides of a wall - is pretty darn cool, but on the whole, the shootouts are a step down from the perfection of the director's previous work. They're a bit too formulaic, incorporate way too much slow-motion, and the absence of any long, uninterrupted shots suggests that Van Damme had less endurance than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chow-Yun-Fat-or-Tony-Leung/dp/B000N4SHNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chow Yun-Fat or Tony Leung</a>.

The Louisiana setting is charming by default, but overall, it's the obvious fun that Woo had making this movie that seeps through and helps cement this one's agreeable blockbuster tone. Some ""classic"" aspects of ol' John's work are overutilized (e.g. how many shots of flying doves can you shove into a single scene?) and may make the film seem hokey to casual viewers, but hey - what were you doing watching this movie, anyway, if you weren't up for a bit of silliness? It's a strong, stylized vehicle for Van Damme and a colorful montage of many of John Woo's strengths; not perfect but definitely worth a watch, from general action fans to devotees.",1308096000,3,5033,6.473997028231798

Enter Natasha Binder whose looking for here lost former combat vet father to only discover he's been murdered by Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) and his partner Pik Van Cleef in a ver special way.

Once Natasha gets the help from Chance it's simply known as ""go time."" The only chance Lance Henriksen has against Van Damme is if he were to resurrect Pumpkinhead for a battle royal of B glory. Naturally Chance proves himself as the ultimate prey and even finishes off Emil with the old grenade down the pants trick.

So despite the fact that Hard Target clearly was overshadowed by the success of Mike, Cad, and Don in Death Ring it was still an amazingly awesome movie.

62936,3,0783227892,"Directed by John Woo, Hard Target (1993) was the acclaimed Hong Kong director's first film for an American studio.  Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (Timecop), the film features some of Woo's trademark techniques for action and violence, involving fights, shootouts, pyrotechnics, and vehicular stunts.  While the story itself is pure fantasy, Hard Target is a rather entertaining comic book adventure that features a high level of violence, presented straightforwardly without a high degree of humor.

Set in New Orleans, the story revolves around a mysterious group led by Emil Fouchon (Lance Hendrickson), that arranges for wealthy clients to hunt humans like prey.  The victims are usually down on their luck, ex-military vets, who are promised a large sum of money if they survive the deadly game.  Coming from the success of Universal Soldier (1992), Van Damme was entering his prime.  As Chance Boudreaux, he comes to the aid of Natasha `Nat' Binder (Yancy Butler) whose missing father is a losing player in Fouchon's game.  As the pair look into the disappearance of the woman's father, they soon learn his fate.  Things start to unravel, and the body count starts to climb, as Boudreaux finds himself the target of Fouchon's motley group of recreational killers.

Fouchon is menacing and talks tough, but does not have the fighting skills or stones, to back it up.  Number two heavy, Pick Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), is pretty mean and evil, in a two dimensional way, and certainly looks the part, but his exit from the film is rather lame.  Yancy Butler (Witchblade) does a good job at looking scared, shocked, and surprised.  What scant intentional humor there is, comes from Wilford Brimley, who plays Boudreaux's Uncle Douvee.  With a heavily overdone Cajun accent, Mr. Oatmeal takes on armed baddies with his bow and arrow.

The premise that manhunts could take place in the middle of New Orleans is pretty absurd, but with some nicely done action sequences, Hard Target is worth a look just to view John Woo's pyrotechnic style.  Woo apparently wanted some script changes before he would agree to direct, and then when Van Damme was cast, the level of action was amped up.  The strong supporting cast allows the focus to widen from just being about Van Damme.  From here, Woo would put things together, in films like Broken Arrow (1996), and Face/Off (1997).",1257033600,,2370,5.005102040816326

(USA - 1993)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtracks: DTS / Dolby Stereo

Whilst searching New Orleans for a friend who's fallen on hard times, a brave sailor (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is targeted by wealthy sadists (led by Lance Henriksen) who hunt human prey through the city's underbelly.

It's no surprise to find Sam Raimi's name in the credits of this high-profile entry, the US debut of acclaimed action director John Woo; both men earned their dues in the low budget arena before breaking into mainstream features (on opposite sides of the world), and both have become standard-bearers for subsequent generations of commercial filmmakers. Unfortunately, Chuck Pfarrer's shallow script jettisons the heartfelt melodrama of Woo's Hong Kong output (BULLET IN THE HEAD, HARD-BOILED, etc.) and concentrates instead on action for its own sake, demonstrating a singular lack of trust in Woo's ability to court American sensibilities. The director's visual style remains largely intact, however, including his obsessive fascination with weaponry and gunfire, while Van Damme replaces Chow Yun-fat as Woo's stateside hero of choice (the action star is rendered exquisitely beautiful by Russell Carpenter's worshipful camera).

Needless to say, the action scenes are choreographed with grace and conviction (Van Damme never punches an opponent when a flying kick will do the job just as well!), and Henriksen makes a formidable villain (performing his own fire stunt in one of the film's most breathtaking sequences). But the scenario rings entirely hollow, despite fine production values and a capable cast, including heroine Yancy Butler, boo-hiss henchman Arnold Vosloo, and Eliott Keener (BORN WILD) as a sleazy porn merchant who suffers for his association with Henriksen. Look out for the witty visual homages to both LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) and OPERA (1987), demonstrating Woo's mastery of the visual medium and his appreciation of movie history.",1255564800,,1969,5.485148514851486

4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress?  I was crossing my finger for him, but it didn't work out
5. Is there a tournament? No tournament, just a hunt
6. Is training needed for this tournament? He got some military training earlier in life
7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  The only splits are of the flying kick variety
8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  Unbelievably, all cojones remain safe
9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Awesome collection of kicks in this one, it's like JCVD was doing tricks.  He knocks out a guy's cigar, makes another guy spit, and takes off some designer glasses with another roundhouse.
10. Is his enemy unbeatable?  Like most rich people, they think they are...that is, until they've met JCMFVD!
11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  He gets shot, beat, and burned.
12. Does he win? With the help of his ""Cajun"" uncle (Brimley), the good guys win yet again.

An opening sequence of ominous villains - led by the ever-capable Emil Fouchon (Henrikson) and creepy henchman Pik van Cleef (Vosloo) - with high-powered bows of some kind, hunting a beleaguered, downtrodden man foreshadows the type of awesome premise that JCVD typically nails.  In this John Woo production, however, it symbolizes the stylized excess that is the cinema version of sugar cookie, covered in frosting, deep fried inside divinity - it was just a bit much.

Gorgeous Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) is looking for her father, the aforementioned moving archery target, a homeless man with whom she barely conversed.  She quickly enlists the help of Chance Boudreaux, a local drifter and combat veteran, to find her father.  Together, the twosome discovers a local reenactment of The Most Dangerous Game, where rich men hunt poor ex-military men for sport.

Tons of great action ensues, but a few bad scenes are present.  One has JCVD surfing on a speeding motorcycle as it approaches an SUV filled to the brim with bad guys firing automatic weapons.  A few scenes later there is an incredibly lame scene where he punches a rattle snake; although, the snake later takes a pistol between the fangs in a gloriously explosive death.  The final showdown comes in a huge warehouse that is evidently a graveyard for Mardi Gras floats as well as an ordinance depot.  Guns, arrows, explosions, kicks, punches, flips...saturation.

This is absolutely one of my favorite Van Damme films of all time; I mean come on look at the line up. Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lance Henriksen, Sam Raimi, John Woo, Ted Raimi, and Rob Tapert how could you not like this movie. This movie is a great thrill ride filled with all the action you could want, and great villains, Arnold Vosloo in particular as Van Clef. This has got to be one of Van Damme's best movies he has been apart of.

The story is basically just about some rich guys hunting bums through out the concrete jungle. It turns out that one of the people they hunted had a daughter that is trying to find him, naturally questions arise and that doesn't sit well with them. This is were Van Damme comes in and is hired by the woman to help find her father, what they find is a group of people in a very bad business. From here fights break out, gunshots are heard, and explosions can be seen for miles, what a great movie.

Performance wise this is a great movie as well, Van Damme is excellent in this film and never really gets the credit he deserves as an actor. Of course Yancy Butler as our lead actress is good as well and is very believable in her role. Villain wise is were this film really shines; this movie has two of the best villains ever for a film. First is the brilliant Lance Henriksen playing the lead villain, and as usual he is great and really determined to get what he wants. Which is also the reason why Arnold Vosloo is so extremely good as Van Clef, he is just as cold, vindictive, and evil as Lance but he is the calmer of the two who knows when to walk away. It is the difference between the two that make them such a great on screen team. Also on a side note the ever great Ted Raimi makes a guest appearance on this film, great to see him.

Of course on the production side this film is lined up with all time greats, Raimi, Tapert, and Woo. Of course Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert come through as Executive Producers and hired on the legendary John Woo as the director. Naturally John Woo's style shines through on this film and make it an explosive action packed thrill ride. Of course a lot of credit needs to go to writer Chuck Pfarrer who wrote a great action film that delivers. He did an excellent job with an idea that has been done many times through books and films alike.

Review: John Woo's first American film is, all in all, the best kind of action film from yesteryear: all-out battles, little to no depth.  The plot, the who-knows-how-manyth rehash of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" has some substance to it, but little character development.  While Woo's Hong Kong productions were not of Shakesperian proportions, the characters had depth and personality.  Most of the characters here are largely one-dimensional, and stay that way.
But so what?  It's an action film, and on that level it more than delivers.  The first major action sequence features a large amount of environmental damage- cars get ripped apart, blown up and such- and bullets fly endlessly, more often than not hitting someone in the process.  The gunshot noises sound appropriately powerful, as if someone getting shot would take a lot of damage from even a pistol round.  This scene sets a standard for the rest of the film, and the final confrontation takes up the last, oh, 15-20 minutes of a roughly 90 minute film.  You can guess how epic it gets.  Plus, all the Woo staples, like using two guns at once, pigeons and doves flying around, etc. are in abundance.
If for some reason you want to know how it goes as far as acting, you're clearly expecting too much from this film.  As uber-insane as Woo can make the action, he can't make Van Damme an actor with depth.  Van Damme's flat delivery makes him a relatively lifeless character, and his cocky, all-powerful attitude (as in parts of ""Timecop"") make him a typical action hero, the unstoppable one.  As Fuchon, Lance Henriksen is a villain with class and cunning, although he turns into a raving maniac near the end.  Arnold Vosloo is simply the sadistic right-hand man, nothing more, although he gives his character a hint of something else when he isn't smiling maniacally.  Yancy Butler is relatively weak in her acting, although you can't expect much when she interacts mostly with Van Damme.  A surprise comes from Wilford Brimley, who is hilarious as Van Damme's Cajun uncle.
To sum it up, see it for the action, not the acting.

On a scale of 1 to 10, this film gets a 7.
On a scale of 0.0 to 10.0, this film gets a 7.4.
On a scale of A to F, this film gets a B-.
On a scale of 1 to 5, this film gets a 3 1/2.
On a scale of 1 to 4, this film gets a 3.

Contentwise: Being a Van Damme film and a John Woo film, you'd expect a ton of bone-crunching brawls and billions-of-bullets gunfights, but there is almost none of the former, while the latter makes up roughly 80% of the film.  There's nothing particularly graphic, except for when a snake's head is blown apart.  There's no sex or nudity of any kind, and the language is brief.",1198627200,,3357,4.6604414261460105

Lance Henriksen is the boss named ""Fouchon"" who's thrill is hiring men to pay him, to hunt down homeless people who have no family or connections.  Arnold Vosloo is Fouchon's number one guy ""Van Cleaf"" who makes the most of his role, with numerous memorable one liners, and a presence that absorbs the camera.  Its all about the hunt, and these guys will stop at nothing to see their prey dead.

Van Damme did not have quite a show-stopper as these guys, but thanks to Hong Kong action director John Woo, he provides plenty to make Van Damme shine.  Although there are not many martial art sequences, there are plenty of hard kicks Van Damme executes on his enemies, including his famous leaping split kick at one point.

Most of the action occurs in chase sequences throughout the film, and the chases are on foot.  There are a couple of scenes where the bad guys are hunting down a single man.  Some of the sequences are thrilling and suspenseful.  The final 30 minutes of the film are spent hunting down ""Chance"" (Van Damme's unusual character name) throughout the Bayou.  The finale takes place in a large warehouse, where it appears many old Mardi Gras floats and decorations are kept.  The finale is basically lots of guns and tons of explosions.  Van Damme does get plenty of good kicks in his opponents, but no big match ups that I hoped for, and Van Cleaf dies too soon and easily for a villain who gave such a great performance throughout the film.  I loves Fouchon's death scene, it was quite hilarious.

Overall, this movie entertained me with its thrilling chases, lots of explosions, and awesome villains.

Besides, I think Van Damme should be liable for some compensation, after stating that John Woo was ""THE Martin Scorcese of Asia"", which, in my opinion is close to some defamatory remark : there is some violence in some Scorcese's movies, but violence is NEVER the whole of the show!!!",1172966400,,960,4.5813953488372094
62981,5,0783227892,"This is a fantastic action packed movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. The storyline is interesting as it shows the possible challenges that the homeless face. Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) comes to New Orleans looking for her father who was missing. She meets up with Chance, a sailor (Jean-van Damme) who she hires to help her find her missing father (after Chance fails to be selected from going out to sea). Chance helps her to find out that her father was murdered by some notorious mercenaries who excel at hunting ex-Vietnam war vets on the streets of New Orleans for fun. Here retired war veterans are hunted down like prey.

Claude van Damme demonstrates his exceptional fighting skills when he and the blood thirsty mercenaries are engaged in a spectacular chase through the streets and bayous of New Orleans. This is a great action film with Van Damme displaying his customary exceptional talents in the martial arts area.

This film was producer John Woo's American debut and is one of the best that he has made. It includes some outstanding shootouts, spectacular stunts and breath-taking car chases. It is full of explicit violent deeds.  It is filmed in New Orleans and has some good music from Graeme Revell.  Lance Henricksen plays the wicked brains behind this grisly sport very well.

I recommend this film to action or martial arts fans, particularly those who enjoy watching a good hard fight. This is one van Damme movie that needs to be seen by every action fan.",1156896000,3,1486,4.857707509881423

""Hard Target's"" claim to fame when it came out was that it was John Woo's first American film, and that's certainly a big deal.  (I just saw ""Hard Boiled"" the other day, and I'd need seven dictionaries to describe that glorious mess.)

But it boggles my mind that Lance Henriksen's jaw-dropping death scene doesn't land right at the top of every review of this movie. I mean... (spoiler alert) the dude has a grenade dropped into his pants.  He manages to get the grenade *out* of his pants before it explodes.  And then he throws it away from him, right? Wrong!  He UNSCREWS the grenade, hoping to separate the fuse from the explosive.  And he DOES separate them before the grenade goes off and starts laughing in triumph.  But he holds the fuse like two inches from the explosive and... THE SPARK JUMPS ACROSS!  Funny enough already, but L.H. makes this shocked ""Whu..."" sound that is more hysterical than the entire first season of the Daily Show.  Right before blowing up.  It's absolutely brilliant.",1144713600,3,1125,4.747422680412371
62984,4,0783227892,"I enjoy action films.  VanDamne is always enjoyable with his talent in the martial arts area.  His moves are so natural and graceful with a deadly blow.  In this film, I found the story line to be entertaining in that it depicted the possibilities of what happens to our homeless in less than perfect conditions, and shows that they may be homeless, but not forgotten by some.  VanDamn's original involvement was not with the best intentions, but he saw a different side of life and became interested in the injustice going on and became a part of the solution.",1142553600,,561,4.636363636363637

A bit more care over the script and you've got a half-decent film with action at its core. Hard Target is soft where it counts - in the head.

I have actually enjoyed other Van Damme movies - Universal Soldier, for one - otherwise I wouldn't have watched this one - so I didn't watch it with the intention of criticizing it. Sadly, I had expected better.

The script has more holes than Swiss cheese and the supporting cast are simply woeful. I won't go so far as to claim they make Jean-Claude look fit for Shakespeare but you get the idea. One can only wonder if they were chosen for the sole purpose of making him look good - by being as bland as possible. The lead female has done nothing of note since this outing and I, for one, am not surprised. Then again,what was she meant to do with a cartoon character like the one she was given? As for the lead bad guy when he was meant to be playing the piano??? Ham on the bone!

The action sequences themselves are the ONLY reason for watching this movie - and it's simply not enough for me. The set pieces aren't spectacular or imaginative enough, for starters. If you just want car chases, shoot outs and explosions, fine. Personally, I prefer a story to go with it. And a script that is somewhere this side of credible.",1138320000,2,1452,4.37037037037037

63021,5,0783227892,"This is one of my favorite movies that Jean Claude made.

It is filmed in New Orleans, Cajun contry where retired vets are hunted down like prey. These ""Hunters"" pay A LOT of money to do this evil, immoral game of sport. Lance Henricksen plays the evil mastermind behind this ghastley sport.

The object: these vets have a money belt on with lots of cash. If they can make it to the rivers edge, they get to keep the money. But alas, games are meant to be cheated. It's one man against a small army who is chased by car, motorcycles and on foot. And even if they do make it to the docks, well just say, the bad guys get their money back.

One of these vets turn up missing and his daughter (Yancy Butler) comes to New Orleans to try to find him. She meets up with Chance (Jean Claude) who ends up being hired to help her find her father after being banned from going out to sea. He is a shoreman who works on boats for a living and he wanted to leave New Orleans but he couldn't. Jean is at his best: his hair is longer and he wears a mysterious long black coat. One of his sexier looks (Along with ""No where to Run"" with Patricia Arquette and Ted Levine. Very hot and steamy movie, but that's another review.) I don't like to devulge a lot of details when I review a movie. There are great fight scenes, as usually with JCVD, the plot is very good and the actors are well casted.

Lance's henchman, who played the lover of the Queen of Pharoah on ""The Mummy"" is a bad bad man. He has no emotions or empathy.

The ending is quite good, with Chance using Cajun, swampland wits to deter the bad guys from catching him, since he becomes one of their ""targets.""

63022,5,0783227892,"By far the best movie from the ""Muscles from Brussells"" and in terms of action-spectacle, one of the best John Woo has made. It has some of the best shootouts he has ever orchestrated.
I recommend this film only to action fans, particularly those who enjoy the bullet-ballet genre, mostly associated with John Woo. There isn't much here for people who enjoy a splendid Jane Austen film.
Furthermore, if anyone is a fan of this film and you haven't already done so, check out the classic Dolph Lundgren film ""Joshua Tree"", AKA ""Army of One"" (released by Artisan Entertainment, and a terrible DVD by the way). It is directed by veteran hollywood stuntman Vic Armstrong. It contains one of the best shoot-outs ever and a great car chase. The shoot-out is very reminisent of John Woo.
For the die-hard fans, purchase the Uncut Pal version from Amazon.co.uk or even Region 4 (Australia), it's absolutely rockin! The 3 minutes of extended action raise the film to the ludicrous heights set by Commando in the 80's. Do yourself a favour and get it on Region 2 or Region 4, you won't be dissapointed. I'm fairly certain the 116 minute version will never see the light of day on anything other than a crappy bootleg VCD, but suppossedly most of the extra 20 minutes is an ear-slicing scene and sex and conversations.

63024,5,0783227892,"The city of Brussels, Belgium is responsible for two crimes against humanity: its sprouts, and Jean-Claude Van Damme.
After getting fired as the monster in ""Predator,"" Van Damme broke into cinema with his star turn in ""Kickboxer."" Or maybe it was ""Bloodsport."" Big difference. Somehow, Hollywood deemed him ""successful,"" and he graduated to big-budget fare like ""Universal Soldier"" and that one flick with Patricia Arquette on a farm, where Ted Levine played a bad guy (shocker).
Around the same time, John Woo got sick of working with Chow Yun-Fat, and decided to quit making Hong-Kong-style action flicks in Hong Kong, and make Hong-Kong-style action flicks in America instead.
The two men joined forces, and with Yancy (hic) Butler as the heroine, perpetrated ""Hard Target"" upon us all.
In a casting/dialogue-coaching stroke of genius, Van Damme is enlisted to play a Cajun named Chance. When asked about the origin of his moniker, he cryptically replies ""Mi'mamma Too Kwan."" Exactly who this Kwan character is supposed to be, we never learn. Maybe it's a deleted scene with a martial arts master, or something (I'm guessing James Hong played him. James Hong ALWAYS plays guys named ""Kwan"").
Rounding out the cast is Lance Henriksen, who can check off another entry in his ""the movie stunk, but Lance Henriksen was cool"" list.
""Hard Target"" is basically an urbanized re-telling of ""the Most Dangerous Game,"" where bad guys hunt the good guy. ""Surviving the Game,"" the one with Ice-T, is better. Sort of.
At least ""Hard Target"" treats us to a scene where two characters shoot at each other from opposite sides of a row of windows...with nary a scratch. It's even funnier than Chance's mullet. On second thought, NOTHING is funnier than Chance's mullet.
The staggering box-office results from ""Hard Target"" paved the way for such Van Damme classics as ""Sudden Death"" and...uh...""Friends"" -- while Woo busted blocks with ""Windtalkers"" and ""Paycheck.""

That they tossed him a cheesy script and Van Damme for it proves that his American handlers weren't sure about his abilities.  I'm happy to say that Woo proves himself to be an excellent action director who manages to get Van Damme's most interesting performance ever.
The plot is a basic ""The Most Dangerous Game"" [...].  Rich folk are hunting homeless Vietnam Vets in New Orleans for sport, with weapons and targets supplied by the always entertaining Lance Henriksen(Best known as Bishop the Android in ""Aliens"").  Van Damme plays a local longshorman/blue collar type who was raised in the Bayou by his crazy cajun Uncle(Hilariously portrayed by Wilford Brimley, who has a great time with his role).  He comes across waywayd northerner Yancy Butler(""Witchblade""), who is in town looking for her homeless vet father who got offed in the movie's opening sequence.  The police are no help, and when Van Damme saves her from being attacked by local ruffians, she hires him to help her find her father.  What follows are brilliantly over the top action sequences, and performances that are better than this movie deserves.  Special mention must go to Arnold Vosloo(the Mummy in the new Mummy films) as the sadistic, consitantly amused by his own brutality VanCLeef, henchman of Henriksen.  He knows the script is garbage, but plays the hell out of his role.  His lines are great, and his demeanor perfect.  Too bad he has to speak Ancient Egyptian in the Mummy films.
Van Damme is his usually bad self here, replying to the question ""Why is your name Chance?"" with a flat, accented ""Because my momma took one"".  What does that mean?  I don't know, but it sure comes out funny.  He does get serious for the action scenes, and they are spectacular, particularly a motorcycle vs. truck showdown and the final battle in an old Mardi Gras wharehouse.  So Woo breathes some life into the Muscles from Brussles.
The weakest link is Yancy Butler, who never switches from her monitone delivery, and emotes as well as a rock, but the over the top performances by Henricksen, Vosloo, and Brimley make up for it.  Trust me, you've never heard a line like ""Good whiskey makes jackrabbit slap the bear"" until you've heard it from a cajun Wilford Brimley.
For the cheesey action fan, this is a must own.  The action is better than the movie deserves, as Woo basically proves to the big guns in LA that he can make an American film, and the supporting performances make the bad script seem plausible.  The rewatchability is high, and the film is alot of fun.  So come on, be like Van Damme's momma and ""Take a chance"".",1042070400,6,2688,4.754310344827586

Low and behold, he was just killed by a bunch of rich vigilantes in New Orleans. They have developed a manhunt game similar to ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Why didn't I think of that? Lance Henriksen is pure wicked with his grisly voice. A genius? Maybe. Chance found out about this whole ordeal and started to kick some major stern. Check out the extreme stunts that Van Damme pulled off by jumping over a car off of his motorcycle, jumpkicking everybody, jumping off of a bridge, jumping from the rafters of a parade-float building, and much more.

The Woo style, the graceful slo-mo fights/gunbattles/action sequences, is all here. That style, with the slo-mo doves flying, etc. has become cliched, unfortunately..BUT do not let that dim your enjoyment of this film, because this thing has style to spare, and no director has ever made Van Dammage look cooler, despite the Billy Ray Cyrus look he decided to adopt for the character of Chance Boudreaux  ( a name like that can only exist in the movies ). Chance is a drifter type, moody and surly, but of course he has a heart of gold. He decides to help this woman find her homeless Vietnam Vet father ( she pays him ). Unfortunately, he has been murdered by the Lance Henrikson character, who provides human victims to rich men who wish to kill the ultimate prize, man. Along the way to the inevitable showdown of good vs. evil, there is a really good action sequence involving a motorcycle ( pure Woo ), and Wilford Brimley as Chance's uncle, complete with a cajun accent that threatens to turn this film in to camp. I am only familiar with a couple of John Woo films from his pre-Hollywood days, but I can tell you that he is the finest action director working today. It's not just about violence with him, it's about beauty, human emotion, and astonishing camera work. If you are new to the Woo, and are interested in his recent work, you will enjoy Hard Target, as well as Broken Arrow.

Woo is the object of many a movie lovers affection, his kinetic action style is all over action movies now.  Watch a movie before his Hard-Boiled and you'll get the idea of how unremarkable action movies were before he came along.  This is Woo at his most flamboyant in his American film work.  Swooping tracking shots, lots and lots of slow motion, still-frame cuts, jump cuts, everything is used.  He has seemed to tone that down in new movies, they still have the violence just not the flamboyant Woo I loved.  While I'm on the violence, its insane hyper-violence, and he succeeds in making Jean-Claude Van Damme look cool, no small feat.  The thing I have to say though is how surprisingly good this movie holds up to repeat viewings, it actually gets better.  I respect Woo trying to bring some sort of theme into the proceedings, that being the alienation of the homeless and how the poor is ostracized in society to the point of someone getting shot in the street and no one would care.  It's somewhat hackneyed, but its more than most have done in action movies.  But whose watching it for the theme, its all about the action scenes, and they are off typically mindblowing quality, no one has or ever will do it like Woo.  Huge Explosions, so many dead bodies, and as many have put it, it's like action ballet.  This is his first American movie, and it might just be his best, its a hell of a lot better than MI2 in which Woo did a bastardization of himself.

63065,5,0783227892,"Positively chilling is the word that comes to mind when I watch Vosloo (Pik Van Cleef).  Vosloo plays the murderous henchman of Emil Fouchon (Lance Heriksen), who recruits homeless combat veterans for a deadly game of cat and mouse. Vosloo interviews rich ""clients"", who pay upwards of half a million dollars for the pleasure of hunting and killing these Vets, which our society has ""forgotten"" about. These henchmen then burn the dead bodies in abandoned building in order to make the killings look like freak accidents. They even have the town (New Orleans) medical examiner in their pockets.
The movie starts with a homeless man running for his life. He is being viscously hunted by a gang of henchmen, equipped with automatic weapons on the prowl. The hunter's goal is to reach the river before the henchmen and the paying ""client"" gets to him first.  Well they do get to him first and his death leads the police to undercover this secret ""service"".  The dead man's daughter, Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) along with Chance Boudreaux (Van Damme), seeks to find out what really happened. After Chance proves the death as a homicide, a new autopsy is ordered--which tips off the henchmen. They want to stop her and Chance but they have other ideas.
Van Damme and Butler do a good job on the run from the hunters. Van Damme's high-flying kicks and fight scenes are awesome. But it is Henriksen and the amazing Arnold Vosloo, who STEALES the SHOW! They are soooo baaaad you cheer them on throughout the film. Vosloo's performance is especially chilling as he expertly maintains a dignified yet heartless persona.
This high-octane film is sure to light your fire, rent or buy it today!",1013472000,,1684,4.840277777777778
63095,5,0783227892,"This movie was a winning combination from day one! Director John Woo puts his limitless creative talents together with a great cast and gets jackpot! Yes, it's a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie but Woo was smart enough not to give him all the air time. Woo makes him look good though, no doubt about it.  A big co-star was Lance Henriksen (Aliens), who portrays the sadistic behind-the-scenes extremist running a game of high dollar murder. And Woo let Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy) stretch his talents to create the smooth-talking but dangerous mercenary henchman working for Henriksen.  And classy Yancy Butler (Witchblade) is the lady in need. There's no gratuitous sex scenes like in most Van Damme movies either. Woo wouldn't waste his time here. Instead it's minute-by-minute action and visual powerhouses of stylish special stunts. This was a big improvement for Van Damme films though his staple storylines are still here. This one's only a sample of what director John Woo can do in American action movies. Yes!",1003622400,,1012,5.017857142857143
63096,4,0783227892,"Jean Claude Van Damme gets to harrow Hell in this one but I don't think anyone told him.
Not just a dumb, violent action film, Hard Target has an interesting subtext about some macho nitwits who sell their souls to Fouchon (Lance Henriksen playing Lucifer, I swear) in exchange for the ultimate thrill of killing a human being. There's an awful lot of fire in this one, and in fact the final scenes in the Mardi Gras graveyard look like scenes from hell with old Mardi Gras floats, grinning papier mach faces like demons in the shadows and even a brief appearance by the arch-fiend Himself in a scene so full of symbolic images that it requires a freeze-frame and letterboxing to appreciate them all. Look for birds as messengers - in particular, doves as messengers of grace - and some nice visual quotations such as Lance recalling DeNiro's Louis Cypher from Angel Heart and Arnold Vosloo as Fouchon's partner, Pik, as a perfectly wonderful Beelzebub (can you think of a better weapon of choice for the Lord of the Flies than a shotgun?) in a pose that looks like it's right out of Beardsley--a long, languid slash of black in the doorway at Randal Poe's.

63098,3,0783227892,"This is a disappointment for director John Woo's (Face/Off,Broken Arrow) Hollywood film debut. John Woo does a great job at the directing helm, but Jean-Claude let's it down with his lack of acting skills, which is a pity because with a better actor this film could have been a lot better. The story involves Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) and Van Cleaf (Arnold Vosloo)who are two wealthy business men who recruit homeless men - mostly with a military background - to be hunted in New Orleans. Their clients pay millions for the pleasure of hunting. When Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) goes to New Orleans in search of her missimg father she meets Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme).With his help they discover her father was homeless and died in a fire accident. They later find out he had been brutally murdered. Boudreaux soon becomes too deep in Natasha's investigation and ends up getting involved with the deadly pair,Fouchon and Van Cleaf. This film is extremely predictable. The only thing that keeps you hanging on is the exciting action scenes. Good performances from Arnold Vosloo though.",989884800,,1099,5.043956043956044

An unintentionally hilarious mess, with not one believable or suspenseful moment.",985824000,,318,4.8
63100,4,0783227892,"Fans of John Woo might want to check this out - one of his first pictures he actually made with an American production company, it was pretty unfairly hammered by critics when released. You will see many of his trademark action sequences herein, and the storyline is actually pretty good. Van Damme actually takes a bit of a step up here from his usual action formula, and creates a good character role. My only criticism about this movie would be the frequent slow motion shots of Van Damme in posing mode, complete with permed shoulder length hair. Other than this minor flaw the film is very good. Lance Henriksen is delicious as the baddy leader of a high paying clientele of human hunters, and give our erstwhile hero and his female companion here an enjoyable cat and mouse game of suspense. The fight choreography is outstanding, and the action comes thick and fast. By no means intellectually gripping, but good escapism - even if it is a tad on the violent side.",974851200,,971,4.651162790697675
63101,4,0783227892,"John Woo's Hollywood career has been turbulent, which nothing really defining him as a great action director. Broken Arrow was bland, the overrated Face/Off was even less fun, M:I 2 was the movie equivalent of a Big Mac, Windtalkers was absolute trash, as was Paycheck. But at least he started out on the right foot with Hard Target. Unfortunately neither the studios nor the MPAA were familiar with his OTT style of bloody action, and the film was neutered before it was exposed to movie-goers.

Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Chance Boudreaux an out of work sailor slumming it in New Orleans, and boy is it a terrible performance, the Belgian kickboxer just isn't even trying a little bit. This was also made during the 90s, when he wore his belt-line directly underneath his nipples in an effort to look taller. Chance meets a pretty girl called Natasha (Yancy Butler, who despite being gorgeous seemed to just drop off the radar completely) and helps her find her missing dad. But during the course of their investigation they discover a game of death in which rich folks hunt the homeless.

Apparently Woo wanted Kurt Russell in the lead, but with Van Damme's sub-par skills draining fun from the film the best performances come from the always brilliant Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo as the main villain and right-hand man. Mr. Woo's gunfighting and action SHOULD also make the film more enjoyable, though compared to his original vision, a 116-minute epic, the final cut is butchered 97-minute could-have-been. All the John Woo trademarks are here, but it's hard to enjoy it knowing what was cut out.

This truly ancient DVD is very drab and murky looking with low resolution. The sound is good though. As usual for DVDs from this era the Menus are extremely dated.

Universal really, really, really do need to get John Woo's full Director's Cut out there on Blu Ray.",971740800,11,1878,4.8229813664596275

63142,4,0783227892,I certainly enjoyed this movie. A group of villains makes a sport out of hunting homeless Viet Nam veterans. When Van Damme is hired to get to the bottom of this situation the action picks up. The human hunters have picked  a target that certainly defends himself. The villains certainly add to the  story line. They are totally ruthless. Van Damme shows his ability to  survive and hang in when times are tough. An exciting action film.

If  you want a real action film, rent Dirty Harry.  Poor acting, horrid  directing, and silly plotlines (was there a plot?) combine to make this one  of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure to see.",956534400,3,497,4.764705882352941
63145,3,0783227892,"This is not my usual genre of film, but I bought it as I did ""Diary of a Serial Killer"" because Arnold Vosloo is a part of the cast, and I in common with many others have become an AV admirer. Although the premise  of the film is somewhat far fetched, it is still inherently plausible and  might have passed scutiny but for the unfortunate tendency of the villians  to kill off as many of their clients as their victims.  (Possibly the fault  of the editing done for individual markets.) This made it almost  funny--violent funny perhaps, but still amusing.  At the film's attrition  rate of millionaires, there couldn't be many of them left! As usual, Mr.  Van Damme approached his character with an affect expressionless enough to  have done Darth Vader proud.  Mr. Hendriksen's character was almost as  2-dimensional as Snidely Whiplash, though not nearly as entertaining.  The  effort to give him depth was limited to a passion for the piano.  Mr.  Vosloo's character was quite well done.  He seems to have the ability to  imply depth to and a ""story"" behind each character he plays.  Van  Kleef is not so much a man with a history (although one can certainly  envision a small boy, possibly from a good home, with the unfortunate habit  of torturing local cats and pulling the wings off of butterflies) so much  as a man with a definite destiny.  If one could actually replay his life  over and over again (other than on the video) one would always find that he  ended the same way:  perhaps not by the same means, or in the same place,  or even by the same hands, but always young and violently.  I had occasion  to met people like him (and like some of his victims) while working in a  trauma center in Manhattan, so I know such people actually exist.  This is  definitely a movie only for the martial arts afficianado or the AV fan  club.",952819200,6,1846,4.527439024390244

This seems unusual to me as in  all other instances in my experience, the opposite is true.  For instance,  the American version of Cyborg is ten minutes longer than the heavily  censored British release.  I think I will stick with my UK VHS version of  Hard Target.  I hope it comes out on DVD here in England.  Any true Van  Damme fan must get hold of this full version!

63149,4,0783227892,"From 92 - 94 Van Damme experienced the high point of his career. This movie, Universal Soldier, Time Cop, and even Street Fighter. Now he has returned to straight to video territory but he still makes more then I ever  will. Well anyway this is definitely one of his best. Yes it is true that  Woo wasn't at his best with his first American flick, it was hacked up and  he had to work with Van Damme (The Belgium Oak), but it still has an  incrediable kinetic quality and Woo's style was perfectly matched with Van  Damme's athletic ability. It was my first exposure to John Woo after having  read about his Hong Kong films and I was impressed. The movie is fast,  exciting, and is a fest for the eyes. The action scenes choreography is  outstanding and Lance Henricksson is always a plus as the heavy. John Woo  has the ability to make the craziest movies work - Face Off - and he does  it with this movie. I just watched it a couple of weeks ago and I still  found myself engrossed.

63150,3,0783227892,"I rented this film because I am a fan of director Woo.  I enjoyed this film because of its heavies; Fouchon and Van Cleaf (Lance Henrickson and Arnold Vosloo).  Van Damme seemed to bog down an otherwise stylish Woo  picture.  I am sure the script called for a Cajun hero with character and  charm, yet Van Damme fails to deliver.  Woo manages to create a decent  action flick, even though the hero seems bored and void of cognitive  thought.  My God, John McClain(diehard/bruce willis)would have been more  believable in this bayou hunting scenerio than  Chance-what-ever-his-name-is. If I can make a suggestion - - a movie about  Fouchon and Van Cleaf, that would be interesting, and certainly worth  watching.  Kudos to Woo, Henricksen, and Vosloo, for rising above what  seems like another studio execs bad intrusion (casting a flavor of the  month action star like Van Damme in the lead). Trust me, the bad guys and  their director manage to salvage what they can of this Damme mess.",945388800,,987,4.81437125748503
7790503,4,0783227892,"Hard Target is a pretty freakin awesome action movie, one of Van Damme's best, and one of Woo's best efforts as well.
You'll see all the hallmarks of Woo on full display here, including the doves in slow motion, overtly ubiquitous explosions, grandiose fight choreography, and the signature split screen, with each actor against either side of one wall as they banter back and forth while reloading their handguns.
With the extended magazines, of course.
""Maximum amount of bullets at all times"" is the Woo standard.
And it's this standard that makes Hard Target work so well.
If you're looking for an action movie, you can't go wrong with this one.

This blu ray doesn't have much in the way of special features.
And by ""much"" I mean NONE at all.
Absolutely nothing.
It doesn't even have a menu screen.
It goes right to the main feature.
But what it lacks in supplemental material, it makes up for in the transfer.
I could not believe how good this movie looked.
It looks absolutely incredible.
I am beyond happy with the way it looks and sounds.
This is also the extended cut of the film, with the bits of extra violence and slightly extended scenes added back in.
