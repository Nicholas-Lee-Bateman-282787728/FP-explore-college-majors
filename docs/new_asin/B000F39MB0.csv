8116728,5,B000F39MB0,Most of those involved in this excellent production are not known to me (never heard of the Basler Ballet) but then I am not well versed in the ballet field.  The conductor of the orchestra (Academy of Saint Martins in the Fields) is Sir Neville Marriner and with those forces in control of the music I was certain that at least the score would get it's due and indeed that is the case.  The sound of the DVD is wide range with great stereo imaging and of course the orchestra is excellent beyond words.  For me the surprise was the remarkable choreography (how much of that was based on the original by Leonide Massine?) and the great skill and artistry of the dancers.  The sets are atmospheric and to see the music interpreted by the dancers was revelatory.  I highly recommend this production which is totally successful in every way.,1357344000,,838,4.56

It there is a perfection of form, harmony between  dancing, singing, music, and design, all condensed into 40 minutes of a breathtaking show, it is all here.  Although officially classified as a ballet, ""Pulcinella"" is a blend of many genres, and Stravinsky himself refused to describe it as a ballet and preferred to speak of an ""action dansante"", or ""danced action"".

This production astonishes in many ways, and given a the fact that Stravinsky  never disappoints with his music, I would first note that this ballet is masterly filmed - it seems to be done in the great tradition of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, and the visuals somewhat remind of the mis-en-scene for Ponnelle's ""Il barbiere di Siviglia"" with Hermann Prey, also released on Deutsche Grammophon.  This company stands by its name if providing the highest standard of musical performance once again with this ballet-film.  This Pulcinella's designs similar to Ponnelle's ""Il Barbiere"" - perhaps there is no chance coincidence - Napoli and Sevilla are both southern cities, and Napoli was under Spanish rule for centuries, which Spanish cultural influences visible at every turn in the city.  Definitely this piece of Commedia dell'arte will especially please those who love sunny Napoli - somehow the choreography coveys so well the grace and roughness of its inhabitants.

I have not heard before of the director Jose Montes-Baquer, and I was so pleased to get acquainted with his work here.  Also the choreography by Heinz Spoerli is spectacular,  illuminating what ballet is in its essence - a continuous dance, never descending into pantomime; a constant varied action on stage, dancing full of elements not seen before, eliminating any possibility that a viewer is bored for a moment - this ballet could truly serve as a high mark for other choreographers to match.

Anther visual delight is that Pulcinella seems to step from marvelous frescoes of Domenico Tiepolo (the son of the famous artist Giambattista Tiepolo) on a theme of Pulcinella; the frescoes can be admired in a special section of the second floor of Ca' Rezzonico in Venice.  What is amazing that even the color pallette of some themes in this film seem to be taken from those frescoes.  In any case, those who made the design knew very well Pulcinella and Commedia dell'Arte style, and they transfer it to us beautifully.

Certainly many are well-familiar with ""Pulcinella"" as a concert suite,  conducted by Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez and many others.  Yet again, as with The Firebird, Le Sacre, Rossignol and Petrouchka,  Pulcinella amuses you to the heart when you see him dance for you, with his lover Pimpinella and all his Napoli friends.  Plus, there are singing entries in this film-ballet as well, with marvelous  Neopolitan-style songs (""Se tu m'ami"" by Parisotti, ""Mentre l'erbetta"" by Pergolesi,  ""Contento forse vivere"" by Pergolesi, ""Con queste paroline"" by Pergolesi, ""Sento dire"" Pergolesi, ""Nce sta quaccuna po"", ""Uno te fallan zemprece"" - each one of them one can listen to separately on youtube, with various singers)which makes the viewing experience really unique.  It is such a wondrous performance that I am really wondering why there are not hundreds of rave reviews here!  But maybe many are busy listening to the likes of Ligeti and watching ""L'amour de loin"", hmm...

As for the origins of this ballet, Diaghilev approaches Stravinsky with the idea of composing a new ballet music in style of Giovanni Battista Pergolesi; after some hesitation, the composer proceeded and produced this masterpiece.  Later on, it turned out that much music that inspired Stravinsky as Pergolesi's turned out to be by other composer.  But if you want to compare for yourself, listen to Pergolesi Concerto No. 5 in B flat major, IV movement - Allegro moderato; you will see that it is used without much change in conspicuously IV movement of ""Pulcinella"" - Tarantella.

On a side note, I had been listening to Pergolesi once more, and what a great composer he was!  His works are another testament to the unsurpassed superiority of baroque music, with its extraordinary expertise and strict adherence to the discipline of form.

It is noteworthy that Diaghilev gradually turned to western influences and seemingly, to baroque music in particular, producing a ballet ""La Botique fantastique"" one year before Pulcinella, in 1919, on the music by Domenico Scarlatti.  Thus Pulcinella was the next in this new trend, receiving its premier in Paris on 15 May 1920.  It was designed by Picasso and conducted by Ernest Ansermet - the same conductor as in Rossignol 6 years earlier.  Thinking of Diaghilev, is it not stunning that so much of his work survivs into today, with no sigh of decay- but on the contrary, admiration?  What a splendid moment of art there was, with so much creation, innovation and inspiration...

To top it all, this 1983 production makes you smile with delight - not only it is masterfully executed, it is also fun and indeed is a true comedy.  It is a perfection in every sense.

HIGHLY recommended.",1298419200,9,5162,5.0519480519480515
8116730,4,B000F39MB0,"We liked how they used the traditional costumes.  The 3rd graders beg to see it every time they come in the room.  Who would have thought they'd like ballet so much!  They get the humor and love figuring out which is the real Pulcinella and which ones are the imposters.  They also appreciated the difficulty of the dancing.

We would have liked the songs to have had subtitles available.  The students are always asking, ""What are they singing about?"" and it does give them extra work with their reading if the subtitles are on the screen.",1170720000,8,540,4.572916666666667
