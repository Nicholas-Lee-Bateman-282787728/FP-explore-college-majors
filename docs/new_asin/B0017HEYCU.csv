8265914,5,B0017HEYCU,"There is no one like her.  This video is a gem.  I've had access to other interviews done in Europe, but they're all in Russian with no translation. In this, the narration is entirely in English.  There is so much than what is listed on the jacket. I will watch this again and again.  I'm sure you will, too!",1423440000,2,308,4.169491525423729
8265915,2,B0017HEYCU,"A disappointment.  I hoped for footage of Maya Plisetskaya's dancing in various roles and failed to notice that this is a narrated biography.  As snippets of Plisetskaya's performances flash by (too quickly), a plumby, Englishy, but noticeably Russian accented voice, gives a comically bright and positive narrative of her Soviet life.  Who knew about her father's execution during the Stalin years?  Western propaganda, I suppose.

The ""Maya Plisetskaya: Diva of Dance"" DVD is better, although, again, the excerpts are chopped up and too short.  But the biographical material is separated from the footage of her performances and is more balanced.  The segment from Yakobson's ""Spartacus"" is particularly good.",1421971200,3,711,5.527777777777778
