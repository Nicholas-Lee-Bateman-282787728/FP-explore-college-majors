My favorite character was the music producer, Patrick Harrington. He lit up the screen in each scene. Love that final line!",1520640000,,259,4.909090909090909

The director/lead character truly impressed me putting this entire film together with minimal funding. I believe it was the director's struggle to complete this film that gave her the inspiration for the title. Without Faith, we may never have gotten to see what this young lady was capable of.  Congratulations to the director and actors....well done. Bravo!",1387670400,2,461,5.315068493150685
