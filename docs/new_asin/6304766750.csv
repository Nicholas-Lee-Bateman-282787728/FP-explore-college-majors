924089,1,6304766750,"I am a big fan of Mr Bean, I have seen him on TV for many many years. After seeing this film, I relized that Mr Bean should remain just on TV. However, I don't blame Rowan Atkinson for this mess, he will still be one  of my most favorite comedians.  It must be silly that someone is trying to  give Mr Bean a Hero's role, We should all know that Mr Bean is a perfect  loser, all he deserves is always  failure. Hollywood is bringing my man  down, Help! Anyway, salute to Rowan Atkinson, he's the best, but this film  is just a waste of his time and resources.",917481600,,559,4.027272727272727
924090,5,6304766750,"This movie was extremely funny. When I first heard of it I said no I don't want to see that, but when it was over I was sure glad I did. The plot is decent but Mr. Bean makes it that much better.  This is definately a  classic video.  I loved and have shown it to many people who thought it was  funny too.  Mr. Bean, without words, does the most hilarious things that  make you laugh until you start crying.  His clumsy attitude makes the movie  as funny as it is.  I have it five stars because I think it is a great  movie for everyone.",916876800,5,538,3.94392523364486

924385,2,6304766750,"If you're fan of Mr. Bean's you will be disappointed in this movie. YES It has some great Rowan Atkinson. But it's like they grafted a commonplace comedy onto a Mr. Bean comedy, with some of it not totally family friendly. I have no problem with that, but this sort of reminds me of the Buster Keaton sound movies he made in later years. Something doesn't quite fit. Good cast, great Mr. Bean. But it is NOT as good as the TV show -- and NOT as good as the WONDERFUL movie that followed, Mr. Bean's Holiday, which is much more in keeping with the style of the TV show. If you want to skip one Mr. Bean dvd, skip this one. If you love Mr. Bean, it'll be one more performance, but he's framed in a creaky comedy vehicle.",1471996800,,718,4.135714285714286

We were expecting the same clean, hilarious, kid-friendly experience with Bean: The Movie.  Our fault for rushing into this purchase without checking the rating first, which is pg-13.  We didn't get more than a couple minutes into the movie before the characters started talking about intrauterine devices.  It just went downhill from there.  Very disappointing.  Bean is funniest when there is little talking and almost exclusive focus on his actions and facial expressions.  We still love his comedy, but should have ordered his tv series instead.",1462233600,,695,5.088495575221239

924748,2,6304766750,"Mr. Bean is hilarious. Its important to make it clear that I really like the original shorts and all its witty British humor. Naturally, a feature film about Rowan Atkinsons trade mark character wouldnt be a totally bad idea. However, the Mr. Bean Movie is a downright distasteful and unoriginal story. This isn't a conclusion I came to lightly either, but the more I watch it the worse it seems to get.

The premise behind the Mr. Bean character is about a silent man with a goofy personality who makes everyday life a crazy adventure with his witty antics and his tendency for accidents. Even though the original series kept the comedy skits nice, short and simple, I don't blame the Mr. Bean movie for telling a thicker plot, since it would be necessary in order to tell a feature length story. In the movie itself Mr. Bean has taken up a job in an art gallery where his employers are not overly fond of him. To get rid of him, they recommend him to an American art curator named David Langley who is looking for someone to deliver a speech for the Whistlers Mother painting he and his gallery are excited to be unveiling. Unfortunately, David Langley doesnt realize that Mr. Bean is the worst person for this job until its too late, and then he becomes worried for his career when Mr. Bean brings havoc into his life.

While critiquing the premise behind this movie there is one important plot detail worth mentioning out of order. During this movies emotional climax Mr. Beans big speech is not only meant to describe the painting of Whistlers Mother but also reveal to the audiences how the events of this movie have shaped him and changed him. According to Mr. Bean, the most valuable lesson hes learned is the value of family.

This is where the movie comes to a screeching halt, because this movie does NOT teach any family values. I can not exaggerate this point enough because this movie preaches the exact opposite of family values. Thats because David Langley seems to be a nice enough guy to his wife and his family. Thats a given. But after his family takes one look at Mr. Bean (before he even does anything bad) Davids wife Allison has her bags packed and is leaving her husband with no conviction or regard for her husband. Her complete lack of sympathy makes her one of the most unsupportive wives I have EVER seen on film. She then takes their kids away too (who also seem in cahoots with this plan) and the kids reveal themselves to be the most annoying little trolls you can imagine. As such, David Langley and Mr. Bean spend most of the movie alone together, but every moment Davids family is on screen only proves how dysfunctional they all are. The very unloving nature of Davids family can go unnoticed because his family is absent for most of the movie, but this is the complete opposite of everything Mr. Bean is talking about during his big speech.

Of course, I am aware this movie is about Mr. Bean, even though David Langleys character warrants a lot of my attention. While Mr. Bean is the central character of this movie and his good old-fashion sense of humor is still present, this movie really ruined the formula it was trying to keep. It goes without saying this very British character has been adapted to appeal more towards American audiences. Mr. Beans original style of silent and expressive humor is combined with lots of dull American-esque jokes about fast talk and awkward conversations. Combining silent humor with noisy humor creates a very mismatched kind of tone, like this movie can never totally decide if it will be the classical Mr. Bean we love, or something that is just pandering to the American viewers. Even the movies soundtrack goes against the Mr. Bean formula, being a mixup of different American pop songs.

Sadly, this complaint is minor next so some of the other points I have against this movies humor. For instance, most of this movies funniest moments are not even from this movie. Most of the jokes are directly copied from skits taken from the Mr. Bean TV series. I won't deny, they are brilliant skits that are funny, even if youve already seen them, but who needs a movie if its going to be copy cat?

On top of that, some of the jokes that are originally for this movie are very rude and unfit for family viewing. To celebrate the painting of Whistlers Mother, for example, the museum gallery decides to sell a pornographic poster of that painting in the gift shop, actually showing it on screen and making people confused if her nipples are in the shot or not. Then later, Mr. Bean actually learns how to give the finger to people and mistakes it for a friendly gesture after he starts flashing it at everybody. After the complete disregard that this movie already has for the good natured family-values it only pretends to have, its clear this movie is determined to NOT be fit for family values.

Im not trying to sound like somebody from a parents group, since I don't support any, but I really don't like this movie. Of course, it was funny the first few times I saw it, but after the jokes wear off theres nothing left thats charming or worth investing in. Of course, the quality of the story is not worth going into because youll probably know everything about it from the trailer if you watched it. But ironically, this adaption of Mr. Bean could have been much better, since everybody who created the original series had a hand in making this.

Obviously... something strange and mysterious went very wrong during the planning and developing of this movie. It is a mystery why we weren't treated to a movie that better resembled the original Mr. Bean we all love, but this movie is a very poor adaption indeed.",1432598400,,5692,4.5954724409448815

925341,3,6304766750,"Based upon the BBC series MR. BEAN, BEAN THE MOVIE brings Rowan Atkinsons famous British character to the United States. The famous painting ARRANGEMENT IN GREY AND BLACK #1 (aka WHISTLERS MOTHER) has been purchased by a wealthy American General (Burt Reynolds) and is being brought back to the United States. After failing to fire him for ineptitude for his performance, the governing board at the museum Mr. Bean works decides to send him to America for 2-3 months to accompany the famous painting (and get him out of their hair for a spell). So, Mr. Bean arrives in America where everyone calls him Dr. Bean (its assumed he must have a doctorate in some field in art). Instead of staying at a hotel, the curator of the museum, David Langley (Peter MacNicol), arranges for Dr. Bean to stay with him and his family. Of course, things do not go as expected. Dr. Beans strange behavior leads to a series of unfortunate events that threaten Davids career and family leaving it up to Bean to right the wrongs he has caused.

I really like the character of Mr. Bean. Hes like a ten-year-old kid in the body of an older man. Ive only seen a few episodes of the MR. BEAN tv series, but I found many of the sketches incredibly funny. Some of the sketches from the show reemerge in BEAN THE MOVIE, but there are some new ones, too.

Although, MR. BEAN was a huge tv success in England, the show initially didn't have much more than a cult following in the United States when it was on the air.  BEAN THE MOVIE seems to have been an attempt to capitalize on the British popularity of the tv show, but make it work for an American audience. In that sense, the movie fails. The character is the same, but most everything about the story seems wrong. Instead of a full-length movie about Mr. Bean, BEAN THE MOVIE is more like a series of comedy sketches lightly tied together. It reminds me of all those movies from the late 1980s and throughout the early 1990s that were based off of Saturday Night Live sketches. Most of those SNL movies were failures because a comedy sketch doesnt usually work for anything over thirty minutes. BEAN THE MOVIE isn't as bad as many of those SNL movies because the character was already a part of a much larger world in the tv show. However, its a similar concept and many of the situations and jokes in BEAN THE MOVIE feel forced.

Its not that BEAN THE MOVIE is a horrible movie, because its not. It has some really funny segments. However, the humor is uneven.

On a completely different note, it was interesting seeing a pre-NUM3ERS Peter MacNicol in a movie. I know hes done other things, but the only thing I ever knew he was in was NUM3ERS.

Overall, BEAN THE MOVIE is a funny movie that seems to have more of an appeal for children rather than adults. Its not as funny as the Mr. Bean tv show, but its not as bad as some SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE movies it seems inspired by. Also, in terms of movie history, BEAN THE MOVIE was the first movie ever to gross $100 million dollars overseas before being released in the United States.",1394150400,,3056,4.438502673796791

925515,5,6304766750,"In this first full length Bean movie, we discover a different Bean. He works as an Art Gallery attendant, a job which he got by ""backing"". We don't get to see his trademark Mini and Teddy at all in this one. But the eccentricity is still here. Some of the gags are remakes from the series. And some are totally new. The ""arrival"" scene at the airport is epic. The way he treads backwards on the rolling carpet. Some of Mr Bean's acts also have a strong allusion to sexual acts. For example in the train, when he attempted to turn the page of his book with his tongue. Or when he invites his girl friend to dance at the night club. In this one, we see him mimicking copulation whilst drying his pants with the hand dryer in the toilet and moaning in the process. Extremely funny. Perphaps the best bit of the film.
The rest of the movie is filled with funny moments as well as drama. Mr Bean has also been very good at depicting doom. For instance in the exam room. Here, Rowan Atkinson demonstrates great skill at depicting despair in Mr Bean when he ruins a $50 million paintings by simply sneezing. Anyway I'm not gonna detail the whole stuff.

925583,4,6304766750,"Mr. Bean is an acquired taste and I acquired it by watching ""Mr. Bean - The Whole Bean, Volumes 1, 2 and 3,"" a series of TV programs put out on three separate DVDs. Evidently, my wife must have purchased them put them there where they got lost in our cluttered collection. Well, I'd never heard of Mr. Bean, The Whole Bean or Rowan Atkinson who plays him, but she's lived in London for three years and Mr. Bean was a popular program on the telly, so it figures that she might have put the set there.

It's difficult to explain Mr. Bean to the uninitiated. The DVDs are a series of skits presented as British TV episodes, each lasting a little less than a half hour. Altogether, there are 14 episodes and each episode has three or four parts. The skits have very few spoken words, but are accompanied by a laugh track. The material represents British humor, through and through. Watch these and you'll be laughing. Trust me. Mr. Bean is Rowan Atkinson who is a comedian and something of a mime. The skits are acted out, sometimes with Mr. Bean only and sometimes with other participants. Almost all of the humor is very physical and a lot of it is really corny. To what might it compare? Well, I'd say it was something like some silent movies, except there's sound but very little speaking. Some of the skits are something like Red Skelton's mime acts or perhaps even a bit of Pee Wee Herman. But, make no mistake, Atkinson is uniquely his own act.

Well, I suppose it was inevitable that there would be a ""Bean - The Movie"" and I found such on the five-dollar DVD rack at a nearby Wall-Mart. In this movie, Mr Bean is an employee of a London gallery, much to everyone's dismay. Well, the gallery had ""Whistler's Mother"" purchased by an American with a lot of money and little taste and the painting was to be transported to a Los Angeles gallery. The British Gallery sent Mr. Bean along as a guardian, but mostly it was just a way of getting rid of him. Well, in Los Angeles, the LA Gallery people took him as an expert and he became, in their minds, Dr. Bean, one of the world's greatest authorities. Of course, he was a buffoon and the movie has to do with his antics and the American's ability, or lack of it, in handling the situation. It's funny, and makes for enjoyable viewing. I'd suggest that the TV episodes be viewed first just to adadjust to this rather strange fellow. Watching the movie first, without the background, would make for a really strange movie. Personally, I thought the TV skits were best. Stretching this Bean thing into a full-length movie is just a bit too much. In any case, enjoy.

I'm still a tad indifferent.

The fact remains that I laughed.  In fact, the whole `destruction of Whistler's Mother' was rather hilarious.  Personally though, I found the rest of the movie to be ridiculously uneven.  I like intelligence in my humor.  I think that it just boils down to personal preference.  I'm not really a huge fan of `stupid funny'.  That said, I have been known to fall on the floor in laughter while watching certain Will Ferrell comedies, so I do occasionally wholly enjoy `stupid funny'.

`Bean' just didn't do it for me.

The film revolves around a dim-witted security guard at a museum Britain who is despised by his co-workers and is sent to America to oversea the transferal of `Whistler's Mother' from the British museum to the US.  He is mistaken for an art scholar and trusted with the painting, but a lot of outlandish madness ensues because of it.

Oh yeah, and the ending is rather heartwarming (in a totally superficial way).

Rowan Atkinson is rather hilarious.  His facial expressions and mannerisms are really funny, but the films plot and scripting are one-note and hold him back from doing anything truly noteworthy.  The character development is really ridiculous (the whole Langley family dynamic is unbelievable and absurd) and the way that the gags are strung together never once gives you an impression that it is anything more than a group of bits thrown together with a weakly realized connective tissue.

The film, while at times humorous, misses big time.",1272240000,2,1717,4.723905723905724
925696,4,6304766750,"Rowan Atkinson is... weird.  His Mr. Bean character was new to me, and I use the term ""character"" to mean ""a person, especially one who is peculiar or eccentric.""

Peculiar AND eccentric is more like it.

Mr. Bean is a security guard at a British museum, and through series of strange events he is chosen to accompany Whistler's Mother to a museum in Los Angeles, not as a guard, but as... an art expert.

His grunts, nose-picking, and underwear ironing is misinterpreted as academic eccentricity.

You start off laughing (or not) at Mr. Bean's behaviors but, at some point in the film, you become engaged with the story.  And that is what makes this film work.  Ninety minutes of Mr. Bean stumbling around would not work!  The plot emerges around his stumbling and fumbling, and turns into a fun story.  The other actors are great as well, being ""normal"" personae to be compared to Mr. Bean's, well, ""Abbie Normal"" persona.

One of the funniest British guys that happens to really appeal to Americans, this movie shows us why Mr. Bean has had such a successful run with his famous British comedy show.  He never speaks much, but his actions speak volumes about how funny he is.

This movie does a great job of capturing the feel of his TV show and bringing on the laughs nonstop.  Bringing him over to America was a great idea for a film storyline, because his character brought me to tears in laughter several times.  The Americans didn't know how to react to him and just thought he was really strange, and Mr. Bean didn't seem phased by this at all.  In fact, I think he LIKED people thinking he was weird.

I liked the part where a turkey was on Bean's head and he was dancing around, and especially the part where his pants got wet while during an important business meeting and he didn't want people thinking he wet himself, so he was walking around hiding the wet spot on his pants, and during one scene, he was trying to dry his pants by walking back and forth across a moving fan, lol.

Of course there are many contenders for that title, more all the time now that Hollywood is in an unimaginative slump, but this movie commits the unforgivable sin of comedy: it gets the tone wrong. Comedy is entirely about tone (as are cartoons). Get it wrong and it doesn't matter how much you get right. Of course, there is plenty else to help the film lope along to its failed finish. The entire cast is miscast except for Rowan Atkinson. How much better these things play in the low budget BBC sets, since they are essentially stand-up mixed with filmed plays.

Compare this to Johnny English, a venerable vehicle for Atkinson's considerable talents and there is no comparison. Why? Because JE is understated and plays off the already subtle Bond canon, itself quintessentially British. Whereas the ghastly mistake that is Bean plays like the worst over the top laugh track and all boisterous American comedy (exactly the sort of non- funny sitcoms that have dominated current American TV since Friends managed to walk the precarious line). Even the animated Bean is better than this flop of a film, although the cartoon series seems superfluous since the live action Bean series is already essentially a cartoon. At any rate, RA deserves better, and he got it with Johnny English, as subtle, brilliant and witty as Bean is dull, heavy handed and boorish. JE is a keeper. Bean is a casualty.

D., to preside over an art exhibition featuring Whistler's Mother, meeting with gallery caretaker David Langley, with whom he is to stay for a couple of weeks until the unveiling. Unbeknownst to his american acquaintances, Mr. Bean is actually only a caretaker. When asked what he does exactly, he accurately states,

""I sit in the corner, and look at pictures.""

He becomes acquainted with his family - a young boy who thinks he's ""cool"", a teenage girl whose entire perpsective deals with dating, judging Mr. Bean on some sort of  1-10 stud level, the wife who despises him, comparing him to a martian, with only Langley willing to grant him the benefit of the doubt, which does actually turn out to be quite a mistake, as the painting is ruined by a sneeze - poor Mr. Bean tries to clean it up, but sadly, every effort is met with worsening consquences. To rectify the situation, ""Ninja Bean"" actually initiates a solution wherein he replaces the portrait with a poster, adding some eggs, bubblegum, and nail polish for substance. Well, it seems that he actually does a pretty good job surmising the overall impression of Whistler's Mother during his 'analysis' {really, the most Mr. Bean has ever spoken}. Also amusing is the manner in which he distracts the security guard on night watch.

Mr. Bean takes in Hollywood and sections of surrounding L.A., from cruising down Hollywood Boulevard to enjoying the attractions at the Santa Monica pier, as the quintessential tourist, learning some very interesting gesticulations along the way.

He finally returns to his British home, snuggles with Teddy, and admires the prize of his trip, featuring a hilarious drawing of his own character of where Whistler's Mother's face should be.

I feel Rowan Atkinson did a marvellous performance as the cinematic Bean, bringing the character to wonderful life for the big screen. A delightful addition to the series quite well done.

__________________

For those unfamiliar, Mr. Bean is a quietly awkward well-dressed British jester somewhat resembling a Pee Wee Herman, who manages to communicate through various sounds and hand-gestures. Mainly a slapstick character, he manages to find himself in exagerrated and oft-times dangerous predicaments wherein unexpected fortuitousness always manages to occur, what I sometimes refer to as ""the luck of the gump"".

As mentioned, fans will be familiar with some of the gags that appear in the movie, albeit under new circumstances. However, there are some new ones that generate enough novelty to make the movie worth seeing.

With the longer format, I am not all that sure that the Bean concept was as punchy as the episodes. I certainly didn't experience any physical discomfort, cramping, breathing difficulties or blurred vision. However, this movie was a good dose of light and amusing entertainment.

926185,2,6304766750,"Rowan Atkinson is, without a doubt, one of Britain's funniest comedians. His ""Mr. Bean"" series, available on DVD, presents Atkinson's perfectly modern British update of classic silent physical clowns like Keaton, Lloyd, Chaplin, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Mr. Bean himself is a mischievious creature who, like a little boy, is prone to both extreme malevolence as well as extreme silliness. He's an unforgettable character, and Atkinson devised several extremely clever skits to showcase this. The ""Mr. Bean"" boxed set is brilliant.

""Bean,"" however, is a mistake. If you love Mr. Bean, skip directly to the last third of the film in which the director finally allows Atkinson to be himself and make the audience laugh. The rest of the film is a poorly conceived attempt to meld Mr. Bean's cartoonlike persona to a standard American-style family comedy. The plot and flat production values kept reminding me of the low budget comedies of the 1980s that wound up being shown on HBO every Saturday afternoon. The basic idea of the film is a sound one - the famous painting ""Whistler's Mother"" is being transported to the USA and Bean, through a misunderstanding, is sent with it as an ""art expert.""

Throughout the first two-thirds of the film, Bean sticks out like a sore thumb. In much the same way that MGM insisted that the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy soften up their humor, every attempt is made to change Mr. Bean from a trickster into a well-meaning oddball who only wants to help his bland co-stars find happiness. On the TV series, Bean gets himself into trouble because he is trying to do things ""correctly"" whereas here he gets himself into trouble trying to help. It's funny watching pratfalls when they backfire on the person doing them; it's not as funny when the pratfalls have consequences on other characters.

Younger children will enjoy this movie, as most of the comedy is age-appropriate. But true Mr. Bean fans will be as disappointed as I.",1105920000,7,1974,4.886567164179104

And that was Bean. This movie was too hillarious for words. Rowan Atkinson is one of the greatest comedic masterminds of all time. He can take one simple mistake such as for example, sneezing on an important piece of American history like the ""Whistler's Mother"" painting and turning it into a full scale disaster involving paint thinner, breaking and entering, bathroom humor, and an incredibly moving speech and make it so frickin funny that you have to see it again. I must admit, I saw Bean 3 times that year and it got funnier every time. It's like a classic film such as Forrest Gump or Star Wars. Films like that get better and better everytime because you notice something new and it feels like watching a brand new movie. That's what makes movie watching so worthwhile. It starts to grow on you. But anyhow, Bean is probably one of the greatest comedies of all time and it only gets better because behind this great comedy there was an even greater television series. In 1998, the Fox family channel which is now ABC family swept into my cable company's channel list and Mr Bean was one of the shows that came on all the time. And it's even funnier that the movie.

The Bean television show draws most of its humor from sight gags; indeed, it could almost be a silent movie. This Hollywood film, however, is something else entirely, and it suffers for it. Bean is obliged to talk a good deal, which doesn't suit the character well nor play to his special persona's strengths. The plot involves Bean being sent to Los Angeles, pretending to be an art expert. He stays with a typical dysfunctional family (ho hum) and ends up wreaking havoc but ultimately solving their problems too. There are too many squeamish gross-out gags (some featuring Bean in an operating room) that might please the intended teen audience but aren't terribly funny. The funniest stuff comes when Bean accidentally destroys the famous painting of Whistler's Mother and strives to draw his own face on it instead. So, see it once for the heck of it, but you'll have more fun watching any of the original Bean television shows.",1083888000,3,1108,4.806282722513089

A famous American painting is bought from the Brits and goes back to the US; the British art museum is asked to send a renown art scholar who will deliver a speech during the celebration of the masterpiece return. They decide to send Bean. He is no scholar, of course, he's just a watchman they wish they could fire; but they can't, so they are happy to get rid of him at least for a couple of months by sending him to the States.
Some of the antics are taken from the TV series, but there are many new ones you will enjoy. The episode of Mr. Bean's arrival to the airport is priceless, as well as his ""performance"" in front of the mirror-wall at the police station.
Highly recommended to any Bean lover.",1062201600,15,835,4.2578616352201255

926275,4,6304766750,"There are two schools of thought on British Humor.  You like it or you hate it.  Period.  I've always been a fan of Rowan Atkinson, not only for the Mr. Bean Character but also for the Black Adder series.
Bean is simply a goofy British nerd.  Doesn't have too many friends, isn't particularly smart, and kind of goes through life pretty well oblivious to everything around him.  In this film he's mistaken for an Art Expert for a museum travelling to LA.  The plot isn't much and never is.
Everything is about the Chaos Bean brings to everything he does.  Not as good as the TV series, but I don't think Bean fans will be disappointed.
If you're not a Bean fan...avoid it at all costs.

926277,4,6304766750,"Since Rowan Atkinson's success with his television show ""Mr. Bean"" made a big splash here in the States, everyone anticipated his character's debut in a feature film.  The result was different from his television version.  Much of what happens in the film version tends to get watered down.  Somehow, his antics just worked better in his television format.
He is still funny, though.  What made his television version work was the small city that he was in and he wasn't bombarded by too many characters at once.  With the film, everything else was a distraction.  If it were just a movie with Mr. Atkinson, I would have loved it more.  He can do so much without having supporting characters around him.",1039478400,,703,4.760330578512397

926279,2,6304766750,"Don't get me wrong, I love Mr. Bean. I love how Rowan Atkinson plays this nosey guy who sticks his nose in to other people's business and never speaks a word. Not to mention the teddy bear, where on some episodes its head is too small, and on other episodes its head is too big. The only drawback was there were so few episodes made between the 1989-1995 time period, no more than two made a year. Then why did I give the 1997 movie a two star rating. Well, put it this way: Mr. Bean does not look good with Hollywood style production. The production was very down to earth on the old TV series, but with the movie, every Hollywood cliche is put in to use and it falls flat. Plus it's set in America where Bean just looks so out of place. Not to mention, I find the TV series hilarious, but the movie really falls flat in the funny department. The old TV series were filmed in England, which fits fine with this type of humor. Being a lover of some of the better Britcoms out there like Monty Python, Keeping Up Appearances, and of course Mr. Bean, this movie is a prime example of what not to do with a movie: try to Americanize a Britcom.",1007769600,6,1140,4.16289592760181

Well, yes and no. The premise of Bean being sent to the U.S. to oversee the unveiling of Whistler's Mother just so his co-workers could get rid of him was a great plot for a feature-length film.
However, the director, Mel Smith went for a lot of old material; popping the barf bag on the plane and so forth. So, yes it does work as a movie, but get ready for some familiar gags from the TV series.",1000339200,,574,4.088495575221239

The painting had been brought by Generel Newton (Burt Reynolds) who is not an art lover but doesn't like the frenchies owning American's painting. Bean is a guard (I think). His host is David (Peter McNicol). At one point askes Bean what he does at the art gallery in London. He relies ""I sit in the corner and look at the paintings.""
What a job! Newton will arive at the gallery at 10:00 A.m and the people see it there first time at 10:30 A.M and Bean has to give a speech at about a half hour later. But when the painting arrives Bean sneezes on it and the painting gets messed up and Bean replaces with a poster.

It became instant favorite becaue it includes all of the best Bean sketches rolled together into one, hilarious film. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) who is almost a mime in these popular shows and movie still manages to get his message across. Those of you who have never seen his show will be thrilled with it, it's simply hilarious if you've never seen him before. Those of you who HAVE seen him might be dissapointed due to the lack of new material, still the plot's good, the dialogue clever, and the acting, SUPERB!",976492800,,652,4.533898305084746
926395,4,6304766750,"I've never seen such passionate divergence on such a trivial subject.  The previous reviews of ""Bean"" come from two camps, each equally certain that they alone understand this film, either 5 stars or one with  few in between.  Well, let me add my own analysis to this over-analyzed  subject.  Yes, Bean is in California.  This is the big screen and little  English barber shop pantomimes, while perfect for the cozy confines of the  British television series, wouldn't have translated to a full-length  feature, especially one introducing Mr. Bean to many American viewers for  the first time.  And yes, Bean speaks.  That was inevitable in the movie.  There had to be some compromises (or call them modifications, depending  upon which camp you're coming from).  The most substantial change was to  Bean's basic character.  Let's face it.  The Bean of the television series  is not a nice person.  He may not understand immediately every situation  life throws him into, but as soon as he catches on he's up to some  malicious mischief.  I once heard his character accurately described as  "" a hideous cocktail of innocence and malevolence.""  This  wouldn't have cut it in a Hollywood production.  They didn't need to employ  a troop of marketing consultants to study the demographics of their  potential audience.  It was the public at large, all ages and persuasions,  not a core group of Bean cultists huddled around their tellys and giggling  at the fate of Bean's latest victims.  So, yes, they did soften Bean's  basic instincts but try to get over it because here's the point:  IT'S  STILL FUNNY.  Relax and enjoy; life's too short and any Bean makes it more  enjoyable.",961977600,12,1678,4.924187725631769

926398,5,6304766750,"This was my first exposure to Rowan Atkinson, who plays Bean. I have since seen his TV work, some of which is as good as the movie and some falls short. This movie seems to bring out diverse opinions; however, I am very  much in the camp that thinks Rowan Atkinson is one of those great comics  that comes along rarely. The movie is about this child-like character who  is constantly having misadventures, but he is capable of moments of genius.  One thus watches him get in and out of trouble. The real story, however, is  Bean, the comedic character. He is trully unusual. He seems to me to have  elements of Chaplin (one can feel real sympathy for his characters), Jerry  Lewis (similar facial expressions), and Pee Wee Herman (they share a comic  silliness that will appeal to children).
