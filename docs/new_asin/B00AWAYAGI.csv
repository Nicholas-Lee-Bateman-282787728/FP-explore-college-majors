5518301,1,B00AWAYAGI,Not worth watching.,1421625600,,19,5.666666666666667
5518382,1,B00AWAYAGI,"If you are going to make a movie with a firearm as the characters tool of the trade, at least try to use props that look real. Break action pellet guns? Waste of 2 minutes before I turned it off. If the the people that made it didn't make the effort, why should I make the effort to finish it? I am sure there was a message in the movie, but i will never know. Good luck with your next production.",1482624000,,397,3.9135802469135803
5518383,5,B00AWAYAGI,Former service. Great documentary,1481414400,,33,7.5
5518384,4,B00AWAYAGI,"Short, interesting, worth a look.",1481241600,,33,5.8
5518385,2,B00AWAYAGI,"Kind of a two-bit attempt to portray the cost of killing, whether justified or not.",1481241600,,83,4.6
5518386,1,B00AWAYAGI,They are shooting pellet guns! Can't believe I watched the whole movie.,1480896000,,71,5.0
5518387,1,B00AWAYAGI,"Is this a joke? How does this type of trash end up in Amazon movies? This is just hilarious, wow.",1480032000,,97,3.9
5518388,2,B00AWAYAGI,Too short with minimal plot.,1479772800,,28,4.8
5518389,2,B00AWAYAGI,"Original comment: This is ridiculous.  It's such a cheap production that the guy we see at the beginning is actually armed with an air rifle.

Having heard from someone who apparently has inside knowledge of the production, this should inspire other people to make no-budget films and improve as they go.",1478736000,2,304,4.9411764705882355
5518390,5,B00AWAYAGI,"A little confusing, some editing cuts felt unneeded, and the heart beating scene could have used some tense music. However, overall really good. I think cinematography may be your strong suit'. The camerawork really brought me into the film and made me feel as if I were there.",1477872000,,277,4.791666666666667
5518391,1,B00AWAYAGI,8 wasted minutes,1477526400,,16,4.666666666666667
8558276,2,B00AWAYAGI,"Lighting was all off. The sound design could use some edits also. Hard to watch, but not in a good way.

To be honest, is better than my short films, And it could be so much better if only they put a little more time into the post prodution.",1520640000,,241,3.9183673469387754
8558277,2,B00AWAYAGI,Honestly not that great,1486598400,,23,5.0
8558278,1,B00AWAYAGI,Bore,1485820800,,4,4.0
8558279,5,B00AWAYAGI,"Nice thriller, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and your mind stays active within the scope of the Director's vision.",1485734400,2,120,4.5
8558280,2,B00AWAYAGI,It was OK,1485129600,,9,2.3333333333333335
8558281,5,B00AWAYAGI,If you get it you get it.,1484179200,,25,2.7142857142857144
8558282,4,B00AWAYAGI,Interesting POV...dunno if the outcome was what would be in real time.,1483574400,,70,4.916666666666667
8558283,5,B00AWAYAGI,GOOD,1483315200,,4,4.0
8558284,1,B00AWAYAGI,"Not only is it an air rifle (as mentioned by another reviewer), but it is the SAME air rifle, it appears they used the same gun in all the scenes.
Bad acting, bad dialog, bad editing, and poor plot. Nothing worthy of watching.
The only positive point (well for fan/hobbyist movie makers), will be inspire to give more bad content to Amazon.",1482710400,,340,4.5
