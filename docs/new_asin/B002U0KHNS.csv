Part of what makes it challenging is that it is not a visceral high-stakes story.  It's a intellectual and emotional puzzle presented with dream logic.

Just wonderful.",1258761600,10,317,4.7592592592592595
3986836,5,B002U0KHNS,"This program was excellent; watch it and then make up your own mind!  The Prisoner has it all; an outstanding ensemble cast, great cinematography and music, and writing with great psychological depth that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll across the screen.

3986838,4,B002U0KHNS,"The verdict:  I enjoyed the series and found it to be some of the most visually beautiful television that I've ever seen.  Casting was impressive but I think Caveziel played his part too flat.  At times, the pacing is fragmented and I found myself re-watching a few scenes.  This helped and I'm looking forward to the DVD so I can do away with the obnoxious ad pop-ups and commercials which seriously interrupted the flow.  As is typical with this material, I walked away with more questions than answers.  I do think this would be a difficult series to enjoy without having some knowledge of the source material but dive in; you have nothing to lose but your preconceptions.",1258502400,14,675,4.677966101694915
3986839,1,B002U0KHNS,"Let me say first that although I knew of The Prisoner television series I never saw one episode. I was vaguely aware of the basic premise, I heard it was a quality program but that was it. I had no pre-conceived notions of this AMC miniseries, other than great expectations, considering the two stars -- both of whom have done excellent work in the past.

Not knowing the story, I was intrigued during the first two hours. The second two hours were starting to grate on my nerves, especially the woman, 6's love interest who worked in ""the clinic,"" who had that protruding upper lip. It just got to me for some reason. I kept staring at it and wondering if that was deliberately induced or an unfortunate act of nature. Quite the distraction!

By the final two hours, I was expecting some kind of meaningful revelation and denouement. Actually, this was so snore-inducing I nearly turned it off the third night after about 1/2 hour, but I thought -- sheesh, I gotta finish this, it must have some wonderful cosmic message that will show me the path to enlightenment. NOT. I know some of you wrote there was more of an explanation in this series than in the television program. Well, to me it was still blather and nonsense. I don't want to ponder the inscrutable and mysterious when I really want to be entertained. If I want difficult to understand and abstruse I'll go back to my Spinoza.

Dull dull dull; incomprehensible New Age gibberish; camera work that is the usual avant-garde idiocy used by those recently out of film school; in short, drivel that isn't worth viewing for free, much less purchasing on DVDs. On the other hand, watching an ""event"" on AMC that was promoted for weeks, we weren't subjected to those universally used nasty overlay graphics that intrude and interrupt the viewing, trying to entice you with what's coming up next, what you should watch another week, blah blah blah. I'd like to horsewhip the person who invented such torture.

I get the feeling those who knew and loved The Prisoner television series will hate this mini remake, and those of us who knew nothing about the original will find this utterly without context and meaning. Remember, this is merely my opinion, so if you like this AMC set, go for it.",1258502400,15,2247,4.652392947103275
3986840,1,B002U0KHNS,"I've been a huge fan of the original series since I first saw it in the 60's and now have the DVD.  What an amazingly creative, mind bending show it was.  This new version of The Prisoner is simply a boring travesty.  What a shame.  Someone involved should have taken the time to watch the original to see what made it so great, all of which is missing from this new version.  I was looking forward to watching the new version with an open mind but honestly had a hard time caring after part 1.  The original was creative beyone imagination, especially for TV in the 60's.  It took chances, was exciting, fun, thought provoking and made you think. The new version was boring and confusing.  What was on their mind creating this mess?  This ""re-imagining"" of the original show doesn't care to include anything that made Patrick McGoohan's original one of the best TV shows ever created.  What ashame.  Avoid this new show and check out the original one instead.  I'm still enjoying it, now with my 14 year old son, 40 years later.  Even my son thought the new version was boring.  Too bad.  What a disappointment.",1258502400,14,1112,4.517587939698492
3986841,4,B002U0KHNS,"This was an enjoyable series, and the acting was superb. Ruth Wilson's performance was powerful, as was Sir Ian's and 11-12's. I have quite a few questions of course, but overall was very glad I watched it. I write only to add a little balance to the only reviews written so far, all 1-star, and all based on the original from over 40 years ago.

I have NOT watched the original series (but will now) except for a few episodes here and there in the past (and they weren't memorable) - but to totally trash this work based on the previous edition is petty. Ian McKellan's performance alone merits this as at least a 3-star work. I'm sorry your little world was shattered, but no way was this a one-star series - agree that Caviezel was not always that great and some parts made no sense (perhaps we needed a few more episodes?). It was almost more Matrix in a way than Prisoner.

For me a great work is one that stays in my head for days or weeks afterwards (whether I really like it or not), and causes me to search for more information to add to or correct what I gathered. This show did that.

Now, would I buy this? Doubt it - although if the DVD's contained extras with detailed explanations it would then be worth it. But definitely rent it.",1258502400,11,1246,4.316239316239316
3986842,1,B002U0KHNS,"It's a good thing Patrick McGoohan didn't live to see this travesty of his original miniseries - it probably would have killed him. AMC's revamp of ""The Prisoner"" does nothing less than turn the entire series on its head and proclaim the individualistic and self-empowering Number 6 really was crazy to begin with, and that all he really needed to do was embrace the warm, nurturing power of his superiors and society to be a better person. Multinationals aren't really spying on you because they're bad - they really just want to help you.  This surprising return to Stalin-era Soviet-style psychiatry is bad enough but the series is boring beyond belief, a long and listless slog through a lot of dull soap opera stories to get to the limp finale. Watch this if you must, but I guarantee you; if you're a fan of the original (and why else would you be watching this otherwise), you're going to be furious that AMC has ruined this opportunity and cheated you out of hours of your life. Be seeing you.",1258502400,18,1001,4.623595505617978
3986843,1,B002U0KHNS,"This was simply incomprehensible, self-indulgent nonsense with a ridiculous plot and was totally dishonest to the wonderful original series.  I felt like a Prisoner after having been sucked into watching this AMC series (which certainly did nothing for the reputation of that network after the success of success wonderful series as Breaking Bad and Mad Men).  What promised to be a wonderful show was wrecked by bad bad film-making.

I am beginning to think that mankind, at least those in Hollywood, have regressed intellectually substantially over the past 50 years in their ability to make good films and TV shows.  The remakes of The Day the Earth Stood Still and now this nonsense certainly verify that.

By the way, I only gave it one star because I had to.  It was ZERO stars.",1258502400,16,784,4.857142857142857

The new AMC mini-series was quite a disappointment. Without spoiling it for anyone who wants to watch it, here's my review:

This time out, AMC gives us the answers. We find out how the scenes in The Village and New York are related. No need for us to come up with our own theories as to ""what's it all about?"" I found myself more interested in Number Two than Number Six. This Number Six doesn't seem very passionate about his desire to escape and I found myself not really caring if he did or not. The ending, although a possibility brought up in the final episode of the original series, completely ruined the mini-series for me.

How The Village came to exist and how the inhabitants ended up there was quite a stretch for me. It definitely made this series more sci-fi than drama. I did enjoy the many nods to the original series, the updated Village wardrobe, Ian McKellen's performance, and the improved Rover.

I can't see this series having the timeless appeal of the original, but perhaps a younger viewer would disagree with me.

If you're a fan of the original, you'll probably watch this and be disappointed like I was. Since this was made to target fans of the original series, I'd say it was a wasted effort.",1258502400,47,1680,5.161764705882353

3986854,4,B002U0KHNS,"The Prisoner is a loosely-based account of the arrest (Dec. 26, 1948) of Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty, the Catholic primate of Hungary. Perhaps it is an amalgam of this arrest and the one two years prior of the Croatian Catholic Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Cardinal Stepinac.
Let us dispense now of the poor relationship between Mr. Guinness character and his aged mother, which did not fit the one enjoyed by Cardinal Mindszenty and his mother, who was present at his arrest. Absent from this movie are the beatings showered on the real-life prelate and the (later verified) AVO-KGB negative framings that were to becloud and smother the truth and besmirch an enemy of the state.
It might seem disappointing that the Prisoners admissions of guilt would appear to lend credence to the charges confected against him; however in this instance it can be seen as one mans confession being taken by others to mean something largely unrelated to his most personal meaning.
However, The Prisoner is not a documentary. The narrative explores two impossible to reconcile schools of thought. There can be no compromise between an ideology of collective and forcible class-absorption and one which safeguards the sanctity and dignity of human life. To pit these forces against each other, the drama narrows-down the vast geo-social arguments to two spokesmen. Speaking for the Universal Church and the conscription of the soul to the state are, respectively, the Prisoner (Alec Guinness) and his interrogator (Jack Hawkins), a pairing which makes for cinematic alchemy.
The dialogue supplied by Bridget Boland (both the original playwright and scenarist) expresses each mans case in words authentic to their positions. The pen of Miss Boland and the direction of Peter Glenville (Becket) carefully weave a microcosmic battle of archangels, as if Michael and Lucifer were contending over the body of Moses.
One complaint made against this film is the unmentioned and vague crime of the cardinal; this had been done with intent, as in the case of Kafkas The Trial, and other tales of bureaucratic hells. What matter the charge? They are all trumped-up and intended to destroy the name of an enemy and thus negate his usefulness to his cause. In most cases, the accused is never told exactly what he is guilty of.
Nothing and no one is wasted or casually employed. Wilfrid Lawson (the jailer), skillfully evolves from a sarcastic, amoral cog in the police-state machinery to exhibit fondness and even protectiveness of the Cardinal. When, after the Cardinals sentence is commuted and on the prelates behalf he remonstrates with the interrogator, he completes his words with a biting sir, slyly rendering to Caesar that which is his.
Raymond Huntley is pure efficient amorality as the general, and Gerard Heinz as the doctor demonstrates without words his inner conflicts. It would be a mistake to see as obligatory the romantic subplot of the young jailer (Kenneth Griffith) and the political fugitive's wife (Jeanette Sterke). Their circumstances depict by reflection their almost constant condition of terror.
A note in closing. Some complain that the characters speak with British accents when they are meant to be Eastern Europeans. We may presume that the language being spoken here is understood by the hearers without accent, something only one foreign to that language would hear.",1455494400,,3375,5.171846435100549

3986858,5,B002U0KHNS,"Outstanding series of 6 episodes (total 4 hours) in all respects:  script, acting, direction, cinematography, editing.  See the product description for synopsis.  This is not a remake of the 60s TV series of the name, but is clearly inspired by it.  The Village and its inhabitants are straight out of the 60s, but we find that #6 (Caviezel) is from contemporary New York.  Everything is perfect and everybody is happy.  They all believe they originated there, in spite of glaring evidence to the contrary.  But all is far from what it seems.  #6's efforts to escape and/or find the truth are to no avail.  McKellan, as the boss, #2, is an excellent villain.  As Freud said, even paranoids have enemies.  And in The Village, paranoia is everywhere.  If you liked the spy movies of an earlier day, when the emphasis was on plot and character rather than mindless action, you'll love this, as did I.

3986862,1,B002U0KHNS,"Soul-crushingly disappointing re-imagining of one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Only reason I stuck through to the end was out of some twisted sense of devotion to the original.

Only decent episode is the first one, ""Arrival,"" which can get away with being mysterious and obtuse and starts out as a decent set-up. But even by the end of the first part, the episode takes a sharp turn south as the story starts to kick into gear (or tries to, at least), by throwing two handfuls of TV ACTION SERIES at us  Big Explosion, Dying Revelation, I am not a number, I am a free man!, Rover. Cliffhanger. Ugh.

After that, it was all downhill , and I began to vaguely get the sense that this version of the The Prisoner was made by stupid people trying to fool us into thinking they were creating something smart through cheap tricks like jumping around in time and leaving out important pieces of information.

I could go on and on, but won't but for one more point. While I would agree that Ian McKellen was the best thing about this rancid remake, I would also argue (SPOILER ALERT) that elevating 2 to the equal of 6 in the story is a critical error, one that is only amplified by the actors performances, where McKellen simply blows Jim Caviezel off the tube.

Really, in the end, since 2s story arc closes happily while 6s continues, youve even got to wonder whose story this is. And if, in the end, the central and most interesting character in the remake of The Prisoner is the jailer, not the prisoner, then the entire series has been turned on its head by people who should not have been entrusted with the project to begin with.

And really, thats what this finally comes down to. After all the fits and starts and failures to remake The Prisoner, the people who finally got the green light were people who didn't even understand what they were doing. Considering I waited about 20 years for a remake to finally come to fruition, Id like to give a hearty F#ck you, to everybody involved for doing such a hapless job.",1445990400,3,2025,4.444743935309973

This reboot looses a lot of the surreality of the original, but there are still some good things going on. The humor is much more subtle, but is infrequent. Blink and you might miss it. The story has been fleshed out and the characters made deeper, though in an effort to be edgy the editing and rushed endings can actually make it a little difficult to follow, rather than just disorienting like I think they intended. The change from allways having a new number 2 was originally a big sticking point for me, but see it through to the end and you will see why this idea works. Ian Mckellen is amazing as allways, Jim does okay but is just not given as good of material to work with. Unlike the older series there are supporting characters who are actually more engaging that poor number 6. This series won't impress old fans and likely won't win any new ones, but there are some moments that will stick with you, particularly when Mckellen walks into a scene.

I purchased the Blu-ray version, which is available as an import from Spain.  All six episodes are one one disk.

The blu-ray plays just fine in my U.S. region LG blu-ray player.  So, it is region-free.  The image quality is what you would expect from a high definition source.  Colors are good, the picture quality is sharp.  While the default language is Spanish, the menu option ""idiomas"" allows you to select ""ingles"" or English as the language for viewing, just like when it aired on American TV.

Sadly, despite the radiant and memorable appearances of Hayley Atwell and Ruth Wilson, the miniseries suffers from the sin of being boring and does not compare well with the original Patrick McGoohan series.  The ultimate mystery of why Jim Cavaziel is in the village gets lost in an confused and unclear storyline.

So, while I cannot be enthusiastic about the miniseries, I can say that it's worth watching just to see Ruth Wilson and Hayley Atwell in early roles.  Fans of The Walking Dead will also be pleased to see Lennie James in a key role as well.  Ian McKellan is his usual articulate self. With all the ingredients for success, the miniseries falls down with a confused, boring story.

This is a series that has grown on me as I have rewatched it.

It's NOT like the original Patrick McGoohan series, which took me a while to get over.

What is it, then?  It is a series which explores the ideas of consciousness, free will, the ability to choose, surveillance states, and the corruption of power.

The plot itself, without giving away too many spoilers, is very dense and requires the viewer to pay attention.  A man (Jim Caviezel - Person of Interest, The Passion of the Christ) wakes in a desert community called The Village in which everyone has numbers instead of names, and they keep calling him Number 6.  He continues to have visions of his life in New York, which might still be going on.  The leader of The Village, Number 2 (Ian McKellan - Lord of the Rings, X-Men), tries various methods to get Number 6 to accept life in The Village but he insists on trying to get out.  By the end, he discovers the secret of The Village, both within The Village *and* in New York.

This is not a show during which you can chat on the phone or surf the web and still understand it.  Only six episodes long, those six episodes build and connect with each other, so that you need to remember what happened in earlier episodes to really understand later ones.  This is why the series has grown on me as I have rewatched it.  Only on rewatching did I understand exactly what I was seeing.

It's still not a perfect show.  McKellan's over-the-top Number 2 comes across as more ""campy"" than serious, even when you know why he acts that way.  Caviezel is pushed to his limits as an actor and, while he rises to that occasion most of the time, it seemed to me that a few scenes are just a bit beyond his reach.  The major plot point about The Village is hard to swallow and requires a large commitment on the part of the audience to just go along with it.  What really saves the show are the plots of the individual episodes and the stellar work by the supporting cast.  While I can root for Number 6 and dislike Number 2, it's the rest of the people in The Village (including Hayley Atwell - Captain America, Agent Carter, and Lennie James - The Walking Dead) which raise this series from 3 to 4 stars.",1416096000,5,2223,4.338983050847458
3986884,4,B002U0KHNS,"Wow! A strange show. The original show of which I saw very little, this is not. But it's still good and it captivated me until the end. Then unfortunately it lost me a little. Even more unfortunately I think it lost the writers as well. (Shades of Sapphire and Steel?)

NB: Spoilers ahead.

Look, it was obvious early on that this strange prison Six was stuck in was some sort of illusion. So that didn't phase me. What did was the lack of explanation for how it worked. Why Two's wife could be killed in the prison and return to her normal life in the real world, when until then in the real world as well as the prison she'd been one step removed from comatose. Also why Six was brought there in the first place. Then there was the little matter of time. At the start it seemed like all the flashbacks to New York were just that - flashbacks. But then towards the end we have the disturbing scenes where Six is in the building in New York, staring into the village, sort of, while at the same time he's in the Village staring at the towers which represent the real world. And unfortunately throwing around terms like collective unconscious just didn't cut it with me.

However, aside from that this was an excellent production, the acting was superb, Sir Ian McKellen was obviously revelling in his role as the evil(?) puppet master, and the rest of the cast were brilliant.

For a Blu-ray, the Spanish import seemed a reasonable price and it said it was all regions, so I snagged it. This was a mistake, as the Blu-ray is PAL and of course my Blu-ray player and HDTV are NTSC. There do exist players that can natively do the necessary conversion, but they are hard to come by. I thought these archaic standards were out the door, but alas, this disc is useless to me unless I buy a BD-ROM drive for my computer.

So if you want to watch this movie in a standard North American Blu-ray player, your only option is to buy the DVD.

In addition to the PAL problem, I was dismayed to find that the Spanish release has no special features, unlike the US DVD and the UK Blu-ray. If you have a region-free player or are using a BD-ROM drive with software that ignores region codes, the UK Blu-ray can be purchased from amazon.co.uk and is currently about the same price with the exchange rate.

Given the lack of special features and format issues, if you are in the U.S., I do not recommend purchasing the Spanish import Blu-ray. Either get the DVD version or invest in a region-free player or BD-ROM drive and buy the UK version from Amazon.co.uk.",1407024000,2,1239,4.421052631578948

3986889,4,B002U0KHNS,"I would have used ""A Very Different Prisoner"" for my review title, but that was already taken :)

There are a few common threads between the old and new series:
- A man resigns from his job, then finds himself in ""The Village""
- The man (as well as all other characters) is known by a number
- Number 2 is in charge of The Village
- And countless small similarities: the interior of each resident's home being the same as their ""real"" home, the ""local service only"" taxis, The Village logo, The Village shop (complete with a slightly different map gag at the beginning of the series), etc.

Beyond that, they share little - it truly is ""a very different prisoner"":
- Number 2 isn't trying to find out why Number 6 resigned (a main story line in the original, it's completely absent here)
- Number 6 isn't trying to escape and/or make a fool of Number 2 in each episode
- Violence is much more pronounced (an explosion at the cafe kills many, one character murders another, and another character looks straight at the camera and slits his throat).
- In general, the main story line is completely unlike that of the original.  And the overall tone is MUCH more sinister than the original series.

Other reviewers have given the series a better/fuller description than I can, so I'll stop now.

I did buy the UK Blu Ray (region B only, but region-free firmware was available for my BD player, so it was a cheap upgrade).  Different extras, and the picture quality is far superior to the USA DVD.  Highly recommended if you can play Region B blu-ray's.  Note that the region-free Spanish blu-ray has no extras, only the series itself (I checked before buying firmware/the region B version).

Why only 4 stars and not 5?  The six episode series was too short.  Too many plot holes (not to be confused with the physical holes that appear in the ground in the new series).  More episodes would have made for a more cohesive presentation.",1405987200,,1930,4.546242774566474

3986900,2,B002U0KHNS,"*** Spoiler Alert: I will be discussing the plot of the miniseries so if you haven't seen it please skip this post ***

It was not the reinterpretation of the original Prisoner concept as a psychological construct rather than a real physical prison that turned me off on this miniseries.  It was rather the way in which this new concept was presented and then left hanging out there with no real explanations given at all.  For example, if the Village is some sort of shared subconscious realm then that begs the question about what kind of technology can produce that effect.  Other than being shown a room on the top floor of Summacorp with dozens of computer monitors showing the various inmates of the Village no explanation was given.  How is it that the Village residents interact with one another in a common subconscious dream?  We have no friggin' clue.

What is the ontological status of Number 2's son 1112?  He is told by his mother that he can never leave the Village because he was not brought there from ""the other place"".  Presumably then he does not exist in the real world.  So what is he then?  Is he some type of AI agent like Agent Smith in the Matrix movies?  Or is he something else?  Does number 2 know that 1112 is not real?  If so then why does he mourn his death?  How can a nonreal person (1112) kill a real person (909) in the Village?

Why is it that Number 2's wife is kept sedated for most of her existence in the Village?  While sedated in the Village her counterpart in the real world appears to be in some type of catatonic state.  It is said that she was the first resident of the Village.  Does that require her to be sedated in some way?  If so why?

What is the ultimate purpose of sending people to the Village?  Curtis (Number 2) says it's to improve them or to heal them, but since none of the inmates volunteered for this or even knew about it that purpose doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Is it a clinical trial?  If so then volunteers would have to give informed consent.  Is the purpose something sinister?  If so then an awful lot of the corporation's own employees are down there in the Village.  And if the purpose is to improve people's minds then how do the traumatic events (e.g., an explosion at a cafe) occurring in the subconscious realm improve overall mental health?

I could understand Number 6's doppelganger in the episode Schizoid in the Village once you understand what the Village is.  But Michael (Number 6) has a doppelganger in the real world also.  WTF is that all about?  While Michael 1 bangs on the door of Summacorp demanding vengeance for his dead girlfriend/one-night-stand Michael 2 coolly observes him from a distance.  I can only conclude that there are two Michaels (two Number Six's) in the real world.  Does that mean one of them is perhaps a robot like in the Stepford Wives?  Dunno and it was never explained.

And I could go on and on.  It's not that some of these things were never explained but rather that none of them were.  I thought the original series did a better job at explaining the basics of the situation.  There was nothing to question in the original series concerning the basic metaphysics since it was the familiar metaphysics we are all accustomed to.  But this new miniseries challenges our notions of reality, consciousness, and dreams.

But one thing I did like in the miniseries was the status of the ""flashbacks"" that Number 6 was having.  At the beginning we assume that these are memories of past events.  It is only later that we learn that events in the Village and the real world are interleaved.  Michael in the real world recognizes the taxi driver from the Village.  Of course, how you can be walking around conscious in the real world while at the same time undergoing adventures in the subconscious world and not be aware of it was totally unexplained.

So there were just too many loose ends for my comfort.  Perhaps if they had done a full 17-episode version like the original they could have tackled some of these issues.

One final absurdity I thought I might mention is this.  Supposedly the overwhelming majority of people in the Village believe that the Village is all there is in the universe.  Yet in the last episode new arrivals come in on a bus and new housing has to be built to accommodate them.  How is that compatible with the Village being all there is?  It's just one more silly contradiction which makes the whole plot absurd.  I also particularly detest the ending in which Number 6 goes from chief antagonist of the Village to number one honcho in about three minutes.  There is nothing that explains this sudden about-face.",1387324800,2,4663,4.5420673076923075

I often wondered what would happen if the original PRISONER took place today and this is it. This is much more sublime and goes much deeper then McGoohan's. In some respects, McGoohan's series, as good as it is, now seems a little dated, almost but not quite, a parody of itself,like watching AUSTIN POWERS. And McGoohan, by his own admission,never had a clear vision of an ending. Instead, he just made the last episode and left town with a lot of unanswered questions. This version, however, is much more thought out. But, you have to give it some thought, which is the idea. If you watch this and get bored, then go back to McGoohan's fine series with it's psychedelic aspect and relive your youth during the turbulent 60's. That's fine. But if you want to see those very same aspects depicted in today's much more dangerous world, then this is for you. But watch it to understand it, not to compare it.

3986915,2,B002U0KHNS,"I must confess first of all that I am a huge fan of the original series, which may slant my opinion of this remake somewhat. That being said, the main problem with this remake is that it fails completely to capture the compelling aspects of the original, (if it's even trying), which for me were the unbending defiance of No. 6, even when caught in a web of conspiracy masked by sometimes comically proper role-playing, and the brilliant flow of sarcastic repartee', which is mostly missing here. Jim Caviezel, while a fine actor, lacks both the nervous energy and acerbic wit that made McGoohan so interesting in the part, where McGoohan's No. 6 was wary and unpredictable, Caviezel just looks confused. Ian McKellan, while also a fine actor, lacks the boisterous, almost good-natured bully-boy quality that made the No. 2 characters in the original series such great villains, not to mention the army of henchmen and array of high tech devices they had at their beck and call. The constant battle of wills between No. 6 and the current No. 2 was an important aspect of the original series. The thing I found most jarring was the complete implausibility of the setting, where mesmerized characters live in a dreamland with no apparent knowledge or wonder of why they are the only town in the world (in the middle of a desert, no less), whereas in the original series everyone was very aware of where and who they were, and kept up a painful (at times) pretense of normality, wearing the picturesque costumes, taking part in the Village rituals, and trying hard, (in that uniquely British way), not to be the square peg in the round hole. I'm not sure exactly what the producers of this series where even aiming for, but the slow pacing, dreamy quality, and ambiguous story don't really make it all that interesting, in my opinion. I can imagine that the producers felt, given the prevalence of modern technologies, (which were in their infancy at the time of the original series), and the lack of a ""cold war"" environment, that creating an escape-proof, high-tech prison for intelligence operatives and other people who ""know too much"", and trying to recreate the original Village would not resonate with a contemporary audience, but if that's the case, I thing they miscalculated the whole project. Perhaps they simply lacked the budget. The themes of the original series resonate very strongly today, and a straightforward remake would have worked much better. If you've been waiting for decades for a remake or at least a good homage to McGoohan's unique original, this may disappoint.

3986916,4,B002U0KHNS,"Here are a few things this TV series was not:

1.  A continuation of the original story.

2.  A faithful remake of the original show.

If you are looking for the adventures of Number Six as presented by Patrick McGoohan with a new cast, you will absolutely be disappointed by this series, as it does not do that or try to do it.

If you are expecting a sequel to the original series, again, you will be disappointed.  It is very clear that this show and the original show share essentially no continuity.

That said, this is an extremely intelligently written television show with many themes that are highly relevant to the modern, digital world.  I can't fully explain the plot without spoiling significant parts of the plot, but suffice it to say that this is a TV show with a lot to say, with very interesting characters, and with a very entertaining plot.

Yes, nobody could ever be the original #6.  McGoohan's dogged, clever, steely-eyed defiance cannot be matched by any modern actor, however this show does not ask its lead to try.  The much more human character played by James Caviziel is very interesting in his own right, as is Sir Ian's fascinating #2.

You can have your love for the original series and still enjoy this as its own, and very clever and intersting thing.

People angrily punching out ""one star"" reviews really need to think this over.  Are you seriously giving an interesting, intelligent mini-series one star just because it wasn't a good remake or didn't measure up possibly the greatest TV show of all time?

In a world in which Jersey Shore and The Real Housewives of Insane Screaming Rich Person County exist this is not a one star show.

Except in name & some affectations, this mini-series ain't THE PRISONER, in the same way that the movie J.J. Abrams directed in 2009 ain't STAR TREK!  Abrams directed a damn fine film, but it's more derivative of a certain 1977 film directed by George Lucas than anything dreamed up by Gene Roddenberry or his successors.

In the same respect, this mini-series isn't like anything that Patrick McGoohan might have dreamed up, either.

This does not mean that it's bad.  It means that as viewers, we need to re-think our perspective & perhaps discard the prerequisite expectations that the title implies, before passing judgment.

The first time I viewed this mini-series, I was trying to make a connection to the original and could not.  I think that this inability to connect is what has disappointed most of the nay-sayers.  I wanted to see it again, but this time, taken in the context of it being a science-fiction story on its own terms, without any expectations of connecting to the original 1960s series.

This was almost as big a challenge as it was to re-watch BLADE RUNNER without the voice-over to see if I could arrive at different conclusions about the characters.  After having seen it numerous times with the voice-over dialogue burned into my brain, to try NOT to have the insights that Deckard imparts in the voice-over creep into your consciousness while ""seeing it again for the first time"" ain't easy.  It cannot be achieved 100%, but it can be achieved to a degree, absolutely.

Since I'd only viewed The Prisoner Mini-Series only once, was confused by that viewing and wanted to forget most of it, this was an easier task.

Without expectations of an overall similarity to the 1960s show, the mini-series is free to stand on its own merits, which it ably does.  I couldn't help but be reminded of author Philip K Dick's themes of what makes one human, and what is reality.  And like David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME, you wonder what is real, what is hallucination and at what point does the hallucination (or dream) manifest itself as reality?

When I later saw INCEPTION, the ""re-imagining"" of THE PRISONER was in its proper context:  Both use the same science fiction concept, but toward different ends via different themes.

So, if you liked INCEPTION, this mini-series may be for you.

If you're a dedicated fan of Patrick McGoohan's THE PRISONER, just be amused at how they've borrowed some ideas from that series and you may be surprised at how much might you enjoy it.  I remember the first dozen times I saw the original series' finale FALL OUT.  ""What a cheat!"", I remember thinking.  Over time I realized that the key to appreciating this episode (& I know about the chaos & hurried conditions under which it was produced) required abandoning my expectations of a nice, clean ending to the show.

If anything, THE PRISONER of the 1960s was about breaking free of conformity, especially those ""prisons"" which we impose upon ourselves, especially our views, perspectives and expectations.  McGoohan's Number 6 might be disappointed that the detractors of this new mini-series may have forgotten that.

3986919,1,B002U0KHNS,"I've always been a huge fan of The Prisoner since it first aired in the sixties and I watched it as a kid. This remake is not worth seeing... boring, and of course, derivative. Stick to the original!",1318032000,4,199,4.2631578947368425
3986920,2,B002U0KHNS,"I tried to escape. I really did. I tried to escape the notion that one of my favorite TV creations could not be effectively remolded in an intriguing way. I tried to escape the concept that Patrick McGoohan and Portmeirion were The Village, love it or leave it. With every episode I watched in this 6-installment series, I was merely shackled and led back to the idea that it was done better 45 years ago.

At first it looked OK. I was thrown into the deserts of Namibia, for no apparent reason. I happened upon a village of quaint pink A-frame dwellings, all derived from the same cookie cutter. And then there was the taxi cab, bright red Renault Dauphine driven by Lennie James (one of my favorite actors after catching the cancelled-too-soon 'Jericho' on American TV). Then there was the dapper Number Two, played by Ian McKellan, who filled the role with a commanding presence and dignity.

I kept watching and waiting. I waited for Jim Cavielzel's Number Six to show me something - anything - excitement, anger, a sense of being indignant. Casting Caviezel in this role was a major misfire. Aside from bringing a bland indifference to his role, he lacks that background McGoohan had when launching The Prisoner. Over time, after watching his 'Danger Man' series, I joined the camp that viewed The Prisoner's resignation as McGoohan's departure from his John Drake role. Do we really care what Jim Caviezel left behind? A whole boatload of alternative actors could have brought more to the role (my favorite alternative is Lost's Terry O'Quinn. Heck, even Matt Damon would have been better - Jason Bourne fell into a river, and ended up in the desert).

And so it went, for five more episodes. I tried to accept the idea that a sparring match between a single Number Two and Number Six could be played out in interesting fashion. Then it dawned on me that the original 1968 roster of Number Twos were effective because of the ominous presence of an unseen Number One. As things crawled along, it was revealed that there really was a Number One (although not so called), right there in Namibia. We had an answer. But was Number Two ever threatened out of his aristocratic desert existence? And why was Number One creating such a bland colorless experience for us? (I don't want to spoil it with further explanation)

To be fair, the original series' 17 episodes varied in quality. McGoohan was on record as saying that seven episodes were 'about right' to get the series' premise across. The other ten (a few of them very good), were added to fill out the network's concept of a season. Here in 2008, they begin with a very economical six episodes, yet fail to make much memorable impact.

The DVD set and presentation were attractive. The third disk - extras all - was fairly entertaining. Picture quality throughout is first class. As it is, I am going to order the Blue Ray treatment of the original series, because next time I watch The Prisoner, I know it's the real Number One.",1309737600,3,2987,4.681904761904762

Unfortunately, this new adaptation totally misses the mark. In spite of my efforts to give it the benefit of the doubt, watching it was like pulling teeth. I found it to be a mishmash of incomprehensible sequences that have nothing to do with the original concept. Aside from our protagonist's number and a few other elements such as the unchanging number 2, I found the whole enterprise without focus or purpose.

We do not know why Six is incarcerated and what number 2 wants from him other than acceptance of his existence in The Village. Other elements such as number 2's son and his ailing wife make no sense in the original context of a village designed to either extract information or put away retired spies. Just what were the makers of this series trying to do? Even the mystery of number 1 is rapidly dispatched by a grade-school student. Did the makers of this new Prisoner even understand the original work? I truly wonder.

I try to see the good in all cinematic works but to my dismay, I found nothing that keeps my attention or would drive me to want to watch this series a second time or to recommend it to others.",1302393600,7,1408,4.575396825396825

3986925,5,B002U0KHNS,I'm a dedicated follower of the original 1960s Brit series and I found this remake to be excellent.  I came to this series with no expectations and certainly didn't want to compare it to the original which was a profound statement of the state of the world at the time.  Like the old series this new series is full of Illuminati symbolism (e.g. the all-seeing eye in the pyramid - 'be seeing you' etc) quarantine images and the dream-scape where the boundaries between reality and illusion are blurred.  So although the original was a reflection of the time the re-make is a prediction of the future.  I loved the ending.  There's a lot to like about this series but I don't think you can really appreciate it unless you let go of the old series and view this for itself - you won't be disappointed.,1295222400,15,799,4.482758620689655
3986926,5,B002U0KHNS,"I'm glad that the producers of this mini-series opted not do faithfully remake the original series.  The original is a classic and I can watch it anytime.  This is a different take on the premise, and unlike the original, this one had and end in site from the beginning.

No one really understands exactly what the meaning is behind the original series ending.  Patrick McGoohan wasn't talking, and even if he did know, he took that secret to the grave with him.

So, here we have a completely different location, yet it still feels like the location in a way from the original.  You're trapped, yet it's like a perfect place; why would you want to leave?

The same issues of personal freedom are addressed here, but also with an eye to personal privacy in our own world.  The implications from this ending still leaves me thinking and I am happy to watch this over and over, just like the old one.  I do regret that this has not been released on Blu-Ray in the U.S. yet.

Jim Caviezal doesn't have the acting chops this role requires.  This is one point for sure that is difficult not to make a comparison with McGoohan's performance as Mcgoohan had an imense acting range that few can touch, but at least get somebody not so stiff all the time.  I don't know how he does it, but Caviezel comes off as cardboard and sanctimopnious at the same time, but never engaging.  McKellen is as good a Number Two as any from the original.  Hayley Atwell is perfectly suited to her role.

I visited Portmerion recently, solely because of my fascination with the original series.  An employee there explained to me that it wouldn't have been possible for them to film there now for the remake as they are always booked with guests.  Now I want to visit Swakupmund in Africa; it just looks so cool.

It's true that many were dissapointed with this remake, but people's expectations are not always based on reality.  I say, watch it again with an open mind.  Get over your dissapointment that  it didn't meet your expectations and try to see it for what it really is.  Try to see it as if the original never existed; go into to it without any expectations, good or bad.  When something becomes old it becomes sacred in many people's minds and hearts.  You know what?

3986927,1,B002U0KHNS,"This remake should have remained unmade. There were so many things wrong - that is if you've seen the original. I purchased all of the copies of the original and love showing them to others who borrow them endlessly.

The things that were wrong:

1. Location - a desert replaces an ocean - true the top of an ocean is a desert but a literal desert can be crossed with time. An ocean can also be crossed in time but the dangers of fatigue drowning let alone animals that lurk just beneath the waves is ominous unto itself.
2. The people were too beautiful with little acting preparation for this. To play a Kafka-esque role takes training and the original had veteran actors placed there because they actually knew who kafka was and lived in a time of existential philosophies heavy weights Camu (self awareness), Sartre (we are condemened to be free) and Kafka (things happen for no reason you can readily discern), lending a modern appeal that has been lost in the subsequent generations.
3. The fear and paranoia of the original was everywhere you turned. From Number 6 being shunned by the community to watching Number 6 being drugged and reprogrammed while asleep could have the viewer rest uneasaily at night.

The good thins:

1. McKellan - played understood and acted the role of Number 2 with astonishing ease (albeit better than a few of the Number 2's who preceeded him). Enough to actually make me want to watch the next episodes.
2. The next generation of Computer generated graphics made the rover much cooler than the original - you could actually see the string holding the ballon in the original. Yet the ease of CG made the directors lazy not having to think through what could be done - just stick in a CG and we're done - No you're not.",1292198400,2,1755,4.579617834394904
3986928,3,B002U0KHNS,"As of yet, I have never seen an episode of the original THE PRISONER.  I know the show has a massive and very loyal cult following. Lines from the show have become part of the popular jargon: ""I am not a number. I am a free man."", ""Be seeing you."", and, ""Everybody votes for a dictator.""  References to the show can be found all through popular culture. It's a very influential piece of television.  Therefore, even though I've never seen the original, I was excited when I heard that AMC had made a new THE PRISONER.

Seen in six episodes, 2009's THE PRISONER miniseries revolves around the protagonist, #6 (Jim Caviezel) , a man with selected amnesia who awakes and finds himself in the middle of a desert in a world that he knows isn't real, and #2 (Ian McKellen), the leader and virtual dictator of the Village that #6 finds that he is now a part. In the Village, no one has a name, just a number, but everyone seems happy and content.  However, much of that happiness is an illusion and #6 searches to find out what's really going on in the Village and why residents often hide their true feelings from each other.  Through a series of flashbacks and the opening sequence, we learn that #6 used to work for a major international corporation and resigned (or at least thinks he did).  Apparently, his superiors didn't like that.  While #6 searches to uncover the truth and remember his real life, he is met at every turn by #2 who is bent on keeping #6's resistance in line and breaking his spirit.  #6 wants out, but as #2 tells him, there is no out, only in.

From what I've gathered, and particularly after listening to the audio commentaries and featurettes on the DVDs, THE PRISONER isn't so much a remake of the original British series, but more of a re-imagining.  There are references to the original, some characters have kept their numbers and names, and some scenes are shot almost in a sequence by sequence recreation but there is a lot that has been changed.  The 2009 THE PRISONER isn't so much about a former secret agent being held in an actual physical prison against his will as it is about a former corporate executive tired with the rat race trying to escape the mental imprisonment he feels.

Jim Caviezel does a decent job as #6, but it is Ian McKellen as #2 who really shines in this miniseries.  Even though #6 is supposed to be the hero, the audience is left feeling as bemuddled about his character and personality as #6 seems to feel.  You want to like the guy and root for him, but he seems so unsure of himself that you are just as unsure in rooting for him.  McKellen as #2, on the other hand, is definitely the villain and he's such a strong villain that you actually find yourself rooting for him.  #2 is the penultimate politician and though you know his motives are anything but pure, he's such a strong character that you are just drawn to him.  #6 has a love interest in THE PRISONER in #313, portrayed by Ruth Wilson.  Wilson does a good job at balancing the war of wits between #6 and #2 and keeping #6 grounded in something other than his own insecurity.

I really enjoyed the first few episodes of THE PRISONER. However, by the fourth episode I started to figure out what was happening and I began to feel ambiguous by the whole concept.  By the time I finished the last episode, ""Checkmate"", I was disappointed.  I give credit to the producers for actually wrapping up the series and not leaving it opened.  However, the ending is unsatisfying.  The conclusion of the series goes against everything that is right, just, and noble in the world.  I realize that the original show ended even more unsatisfying than this one, but that's why fans have been clamoring for more THE PRISONER for years.  Not only that, but there are several events that happen that don't make much sense within the confines of the universe that THE PRISONER establishes.

THE PRISONER isn't a bad miniseries.  It starts off strong, but then weakens up.  It's a complete story that's not left open-ended. The acting is strong and some of the scenery and sets are impressive.  There are a lot of references and illusions to the original series, but probably just enough to frustrate most THE PRISONER fans instead of engaging them.  It's worth watching, but don't be upset if when the final credits roll you are left disappointed. Be seeing you.

The DVD has an audio commentary with the mini-series' creators on the episodes ""Arrival"" and ""Checkmate"".  There's a separate disc of just special features that includes two making-of featurettes, THE PRISONER Comic-Con Panel, and an interview with Sir Ian McKellen.",1292025600,4,4631,4.594890510948905
3986929,3,B002U0KHNS,"I am a fan who owns the complete original series. The harshness of other reviews moves me to defend this re-imagination of The Prisoner.  If you just want a replication of the original, then just watch the original. If you can broaden your mind, then add this to your collection.

This is a re-imagination, not just a prettier re-telling. Anyone disappointed in the series because of what The Village turns out to be hasn't invested much thoughtfulness into his viewing. Just as the physical nature of the original's Village was not the point, the less-than-physical nature of this Village (or perhaps even NY) is not the point. There is a metaphor that transcends the specifics of No 6's circumstance. In the original, that metaphor was the relationship between the citizen and the state, and the series offered social commentary on that relationship.  This MINI-series is more introspective.  Exploring the nature of the captivity becomes the comment.

Nevertheless, a true fan WILL find interest in positing a DIFFERENT METAPHOR for this version. (Remember when it hit you what the original was really about? You get to have that feeling again.)  Perhaps the less intense confrontation with No 2, that No 6 seems to struggle more for understanding than escape, and the ""stretch"" of the Village's existence are all CLUES rather than faults. Maybe there is a REASON that Caviezel plays No 6 differently than McGoohan did.  After several viewings and developing a different concept of the underlying metaphor, these things (and many others) seem to be purposeful changes made in deliberate service of the different conceit of this prisoner's captivity. Perhaps even the absence of a No 1 signifies something different in this version according to the context of this different captivity.  I won't give you my hypothesis--the joy comes in finding your own--but consider what No 2 may mean by, ""There IS no 'out'; there is only IN.""

Yes, there are differences between this version and the original, despite both being ""The Prisoner.""  There are also overarching parallels that unify the two despite the differences.  If you are the kind of person that flies to St. Thomas for a ""getaway"" but then dines at Hard Rock Cafe because you actually prefer to bask in the safety of the familiar, then you will be disappointed with this remake. (You also probably haven't gotten over Star Trek TNG.)  If, on the other hand, you are the kind of person that enjoyed comparative literature in college, stretch your mind and enjoy this reconceptualization.

All of the above is to emphasize that this is a legitimate re-invention of the The Prisoner.  If you are a true fan then you MUST SEE this version.  The question here is whether you must BUY this version.  I concede other commenters' contention that this version has less dramatic tension.  Once you ""get"" the original, you can still watch it over and over to savor No 6's perennial battle of defiance against No 2.  The pleaure of this version comes in working out a consistent explanation of the captivity (with regard to both its reality and metaphor) and pondering the philosophical implications.  That will require several viewings, but once you've done it and become satisfied with your theory, you may become less interested in seeing the solution to the puzzle again and again.  You will have to decide for yourself if it is worth $25 to discover the prisoner all over again.  I paid more elsewhere, and I still consider it a worthwhile purchase.",1291248000,6,3498,4.9452991452991455
3986930,2,B002U0KHNS,"The PRISONER tv series of 1969 and the PRISONER remake of 2010 both detail the struggles of a man unwilling to submit to the indignities of a denial of his worth and substance of a free man. However, where Patrick McGoohan as the enigmatic Number Six enthralled the audience from the first day of his incarceration in the mysterious Village, Jim Caviezel merely postpones a sense of world weariness that never seems to reach fruition--not even in the series' closing episode where things are unveiled as muddled as they were in the first.  The remake faces the same issues that arise when any much beloved series is redone with a new cast, plot, and themes.  Who will, for example, recall Tim Daly as THE FUGITIVE's Dr. Richard Kimble when David Janssen set the standard for the Man on the Run? And here, one need not seek to enshrine Caviezel as the newest avatar as the Befuddled Man merely because the script says so.  At the very least, a remake has the same obligation to entertain as does any novel effort.  The remake of THE PRISONER fails to do so on so many levels that it is difficult to point out just how and where it went off course.  Let me start with the befuddling interweaving of the too frequent use of dream, flashback, and base reality. A character may appear hale and hearty in one sequence, die in the next, and reappear without explanation in yet the next.  If life is a dream, then at least we ought to know where dreams end and reality begins.

Beginning with the initial episode, we learn of the basic plot--sort of.  A man is wandering in the desert and winds up in the Village, a place full of those who have no memory of a prior existence.  Now this premise has promise but only if the show manages to convince the viewer that the experiences of Number Six are cumulative and that what we learn in one episode impacts on the next. Sadly, there is no carryover from episode to episode. Each one is a self-contained exercise in too much cerebral activity and too little physical reality.  The director tantalizes us with a hint that there is in the Village an underground set of rebels called Dreamers who seek to fight the establishment in a way that brings to mind the Brotherhood from Orwell's 1984. These Dreamers find in their collective dreams hints of a prior existence, but nowhere does the Village leader Number Two (Ian McKellan) suggest that these dreams hold the key as to why they are there and what they must do to get out.  In the original, Patrick McGoohan knew very well why he was there.  He refused to tell his spy bosses the reason for his resignation, and if he desired to be free, then all he had to do was tell his reason.  But Cavaziel's Number Six has no idea why he is a prisoner, and unfortunately he never does and neither do we.  Cavaziel fumbles from one scene to the next, dropping in and out of reality and flashback.  It falls to McKellan to provide the show's dramatic gravitas, and he tries mightily, but he emerges as little more than a slightly interesting ringmaster of histrionics.  The show starts somewhere but goes nowhere, and that right there is its primary fault.",1284768000,4,3135,4.522123893805309
3986931,5,B002U0KHNS,"I'll be honest, I was prepared to hate this remake due to the almost uniformly negative advance reviews that it received and my love of the original series (the McGoohan incarnation is still possibly my favourite TV series of all-time), but I have to admit that this reimagining of the concept is brilliant. True, it's a very different take on the concept of the original, but it reworks the core concepts of 'man, freedom, fielty and responsibility in an authoritarian society' (as well as the iconography) that were at the heart of the original quite brilliantly.

That said, it is slow-burning, elliptical and occasionally downright nebulous - until, that is, you reach a denouement which quite brilliantly pulls everything together and provides you with a clear explanation of everything that has gone before which makes perfect sense within the context of...well, you'll just have to watch it to see...

Jim Caviezel's ""Number Six"" is a very different character to the one who appeared in the original series, but when you look back on the piece in the context of the final episode, you will realise why he has to be far more vulnerable, confused and fragile than McGoohan's existential superhero; likewise Sir Ian McKellen quite brilliantly inverts everything that we expect from ""Number Two"" (and, truth be told, it is probably ""Two"" rather than ""Six"" who is the real focus of this retelling).

Make no mistake about it, this is very subtle, thought-provoking stuff.  Possibly too subtle and too thought-provoking for the majority of today's television audiences, who, in a turn of events which would make the architects of ""The Village"" proud, have been duped into believing that awful, badly written, self-consciously cryptic nonsense like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"" (or gratuitous pap like ""True Blood"") constitute intelligent, adult television.

Hats off to writer Bill Gallagher and the team behind this reimagining of one of my favourite concepts - they've really taken it, run with it and created an intelligent, provocative and ultimately brilliant six hours of adult television.

3986939,4,B002U0KHNS,"A man resigns from a mysterious agency. Soon, he finds himself in a place known only as ""the Village"" where nobody has a name but is a number where he's re-dubbed Six by its leader a man known only as Two. Resisting Two's attempts to break his mind with his insistence ""I am not a number, I am a free man,"" Six begins trying to escape while trying to piece together what and where the Village really is. That, in short, is the premise of the six episode miniseries re-imaging of the classic 1967 Patrick McGoohan TV series The Prisoner. The Prisoner is an intriguing psychological thriller with sci-fi overtones.

The miniseries is anchored by a fine cast. Jim Caviezal plays Six, a man lost in a strange world and always on his guard against everyone and everything around him, who is a radically different character from the McGoohan version. His foe is Sir Ian McKellen as Two, the Big Brother like leader who seems benevolent yet is in fact a manipulative and cunning man who brings to mind memories of Leo Mckern in the original series. The villagers include Two's son 11-12 (Jamie Campbell Bower), the beautiful but mysterious doctor 313 (Ruth Wilson) and 4-15 (Hayley Atwell) who has some connection to Six's old life. Together they bring to life the assorted characters who occupy the Village.

By definition, this is a re-imaging of the original series. The biggest change being the focus is on the mind games between Six and Two, making this more of a psychological thriller then the original perhaps was. These include introducing the concept of the Village being the only thing in existence which does stretch creditability quite a bit. More successful are mind games such as in Harmony when Six is told he has brother for example. More successful perhaps is the setting for these mind games is an intriguing new version of the Village set in the middle of the desert. Like in the original, it is here that the sci-fi overtones to come in. With them the series explores issues such as electronic surveillance, mind control and the ability of an individual to resist conforming with society allowing for some intriguing social commentary along the way. Also intriguing is the clever playing with flashbacks to Six's previous life which are not be what they seem. Having said all that, things can be a bit too surreal and downright confusing at times so if you don't have a open mind and don't pick up clues as the miniseries goes on, things can (and will) be baffling. Overall, the re-imaging works splendidly.

There's homages to the original series as well. These include such things as the old man's costume at the beginning of episode one (the role was originally meant as a cameo for the late Patrick McGoohan) and the return of the mysterious balloon like guard Rover. Perhaps the biggest homage lie in the various episode titles which are all derived from original series including Arrival and Checkmate to name just two. This helps to remind the audience that, though this is at times a radical re-imagining of the series, the past hasn't been completely forgotten about.

By blending fine acting, mind games, an intriguing setting, homages to the original series, and clever playing with story-lines and ideas this version of The Prisoner becomes, while not a classic, an intriguing psychological thriller with sci-fi overtones. Are you interested? Then prepare to take a classic TV series in an intriguing new direction. But remember: ""You only think you're free.""",1274832000,7,3485,4.842281879194631

I guess you could say this new version is a remake in the sense that if something is good enough to do over, the second time will probably be inferior.  The original was challenging, thought provoking and frequently quite funny.  This new show is about a guy who is being held against his will and wants to leave.  If there is any more to it than that, I missed it.  Its also quite slow.

I think the magic number here is ""2"".  The best episodes of the original had the creator of the show matching wits with another actor of equal heft.  Having these two locked in battle was enough.  In this new production Ian McKellen has no real opponent.  Not really.  He's a joy to watch but for the rest its amateur night.

If nothing else, I hope this puts to rest the idea that plugging in a fine English actor (Alec Guiness, Patrick Stewart, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, etc, etc, etc) into a comic book turns it into something grand and complex.  It just exposes the weaknesses of everybody else.

So, folks in TV land, go ahead and remake Star Wars.  Its a simple story.  But don't try to remake 2001 A Space Odyssey because its too complex, ok?",1271462400,2,1366,4.249027237354086
3986945,1,B002U0KHNS,"As a viewer of the original ""The Prisoner"" series and owner of the DVD set I had some trepidations with a bit of hopefulness. Well, trepidations win the day for the following reasons:
(1.) Editing - the memory/flashback sequences that are suppose to permit the audience to experience the confusions of 6 play out great in the mind of the director but create chaos in the minds of the viewers.
(2.) Trying to contemporize "" big brother"" seemed hollow and not well substantiated for this movie. Having a bunch of monitors with outdated grainy images and a few pieces of unshielded fiber optic line was the extent of big brother science. Oh, I forgot the large weather balloon is still there. Did they ever stop to think how many thousands of pounds of force it would take to submerge that much gas. Just more cheap Hollywood gimmicks and not interesting & creative science.
(3.) The movie could have been much better if the producers got rid of ""The Prisoner"" title and the other homages and built their own movie using ""The Prisoner"" themes as inspiration.
(4.) Acting - with exception of Ian it was rigid & artificial. Note: insider comment -  Jim should have stayed with hoops and not acting for the same reason that faith cannot be institutionalized.",1270944000,10,1252,4.71689497716895
3986946,3,B002U0KHNS,"A challenge to those of us who experienced the original prime time.  It's clear a level of reflection went into the script.  Most absent from this update is humor, the sardonic element that so lubricated the original.

Ian McKellen certainly carries the day, standing shoulder with Leo McKern. (Given his gifts, I suspect McKellen would be compelling reading a laundry list.)  It was a good ploy to to focus on a single No. 2, and his interpersonal/dimensional dynamics.  The family was an intriguing enhancement.  Jim Caviezel is competent for No. 6,  but the character comes across as smug. [intentionally?]

The concluding episodes go surreal, plunging into a Dali landscape of sorts.  The energy is there, but  I suspect many viewers longed for additional moorings.  The writers should be credited for economy:  it would have been easy to overshoot the story and drag.  This didn't happen.",1270857600,4,893,5.075862068965518
3986947,5,B002U0KHNS,"Don't get me wrong, I love the original and its campy style, but overall the remake does so many things better.
Don't believe the reviews!  My guess is they are written by older people who wanted a simplistic remake of the original Prisoner (starring Patrick McGoohan).  Instead, AMC gave us a complex representation set within the world of the Prisoner, overall a beautifully horrific work of art.  I have a degree in Film Analysis and have studied both versions, my conclusion is that the Prisoner original/remake is very similar to the Battlestar Galactica original/remake.  Those who experienced (and loved) the originals are often disappointed when the remakes change anything from the original.  Those same people, then overlook the remake for its own unique perception of the original, and criticize the remake because it dares to be different.  Ironic right?  The whole premise of the Prisoner is to be different, to rebel against conformity - and yet from the reviews I have read, it seems like all they wanted in a remake was an exact representation, word for word, of the original.
First of all, the original Prisoner was great in concept, but in my opinion, it was very one dimensional.  Centered around Six and his compulsion to escape, all other characters were rather uninteresting.  If it was not for the superb acting of McGoohan, a few various number two's, and its campy style, the show would not have reached its cult status.
Second, the AMC version was better in concept because of its complex and layered plot lines and character developments.  Although Six was at the center of attention, Jim Caviezel did not give as good of a performance as McGoohan, but it was believable for his unique situation (spoiler, as he was not a charismatic secret agent man, hell bent on escape. Rather an average working class man seeking the truth).  The supporting characters were far more interesting in their development and their perception of the village dynamics.  The plot lines were a tribute to the original plot lines, with the exception of the ending episode.  In regards to that, the original ending was interesting but felt like a cop out in comparison to the previous episodes.  In regards to the AMC version, it was far more interesting in explaining what the village was and why, and was consistent within the overall story line.  I doubt if the AMC version will reach cult status, but that does not mean it is not great.

After the first couple of episodes when each new episode routinely put me to sleep, I was prepared to forgive it because the acting was in most cases so good and I just knew that there was going to be a big pay-off for my Job-like patience.  I was going to say that there was no payoff, but that's not entirely true.  There was the kick to the groin at the end and the realization that one has just wasted precious time.  The only good thing I can say about this ""Prisoner"" reboot is that it really does an excellent job of making me appreciate the singular genius of the original.  I think part of the success of the current series, ""Lost,"" is owed to the original ""Prisoner,"" which also dealt in flashbacks and surreal elements.  This reboot performs industrial canibalism, grinding up the elements of ""Lost"" that were nourished by the original ""Prisoner"" to consume and turn into manure.  Really, I can't say enough bad about this series...and I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't have hopes for it.  Despite all of the negative reviews, I just had to find out for myself.

Be seeing you...number six

It's hard to give an effective critique of this remake without running into the question of whether the reviewer is motivated by his fan-love of the original or whether the new issue is failing on its own.

There's no question that this 2009 version goes its own direction.  The cold-war paranoia and 60's trippiness of the original is replaced with a gritty, 21st century head-job.  Time and space seem to bend in the story - we have frequent segues to 6's life in Manhattan shortly after he resigns from some...shadowy organization.  But are these really flashbacks, or are we seeing an existence or delusion, or are we seeing 6 float between two existences in series?

WHAT WENT WRONG?
I have no doubt that the new ""The Prisoner"" could have succeeded going in a different direction, and could have easily failed by following its iconic model too closely.  It's academic as to whether the show should have been more or less faithful than it was, because the series fails for an entirely different reason: by the first half of the first episode, you realize that you have no idea what's going on, and there are no signs that that's going to change.

Basically, the script goes to great lengths in making you doubt what your own eyes see - but since you're a viewer, seeing is all you can do.  The story so effectively convinces the viewer to disassociate its story from reality that the scenes don't even connect with each other - for its incoherence, this could have been a Cremaster movie.  Instead of a compelling story built around a determined character working against a vague but clearly menacing enemy, we have Jim Caviezel and Ian McKellan basically drifting in each other's dreams.  Where is this story going?  Is the story even moving at all?  It takes little time before the story falls into a horrible trap and makes the viewer feel as if he too has become a prisoner - of this series.

I am in complete agreement with the idea that drama doesn't have to be breezy or crystal clear - but there is a point when a story becomes so enigmatic that there's no point in even trying to decipher its mysteries.  ""The Prisoner"" remake seems to have run well past that line, embracing enigma for its own sake.

I will say that the actors are totally blameless - especially the leads who inject some great vigor in their roles.  McKellen chews up the boundless scenery.  Unfortunately, the actors can do no more than emulating the illusion of their village - where everybody simply accepts their reality, and there is very little sense of menace that a hidden element must work mercilessly against those who won't conform.

BY HOOK OR BY CROOK, We must confirm the following: No featurettes or extras were viewed in preparation for this review (and if there were, the memory was probably extracted from our heads).  Also, while we at ""Rottenberg's rotten book review"" had a lot of fun with ""The Prisoner"" - that was in our college days, so we can't be considered hardcore fans.",1264982400,7,3531,4.6201923076923075
3986957,4,B002U0KHNS,"I have never written a review on here, because usually I think someone out there has covered the respected topic sufficiently. This is an exception. And, for those who are genuinely interested in knowing more, please read on. If you are going to flame me for writing a boring review of a boring show, then stop right here. Save yourself the time, you surely have more important things to do.
Anyone knows there is a difference between an 'homage' and a remake, inspiration versus redux. The writer of this Prisoner series certainly knows this, and those familiar with the original show did not watch weekly to see if the Prisoner would 'escape' the Village. There was certainly a lot of harsh criticism for the ending of that show, and that vitriol reminds me of some of the lambasting on here. Personally I think the writing and the show's creators and actors deserve better than is being dished out here. Although my first take on coming away from it was that I felt a little emotionally betrayed, I realized, after thinking that over quite a bit, that that was essentially the point. To go beyond entertainment, or escapism, and to compel the viewer to dwell on a an uncomfortable reality, I think is one of the themes. Without giving it away, you have to reflect from the outset, 'what would I do if confronted with this situation?' and 'Does it really matter if all of this (society, relationships, feelings, the outside world as we know it) is real, or is it sufficient to just *believe* that it is real. People become extremely heated about this topic, not least of all because it goes somewhat to religious ideologies on the one hand, and issues of authority on the other. Who decides what I know? Who is in charge? Does it matter if this is really true?
Of course, trying to reach a blas audience with sophisticated questions like these is a tall order, and so science fiction (if that is what this show turns out to be)tends to couch them in allegory and storytelling. If its over the audience's head, then maybe the writer is to blame for being overambitious, trying to do too much in too little a narrative framework. Personally, I think the show (yes, this miniseries) is a minor masterpiece, and I think posterity will be rather kinder to it than some of the base reviews I have seen here.
The most tedious, and yet telling, critique runs along the lines of ""I want those x hours of my life back."" They felt like they've been had. They know the bitter disappointment of thinking something was worthwhile, only to decide for themselves it wasn't. But it goes further. There was something perhaps *immoral* about the show's doing this to them. (They thought) it held out the promise of being so much more. It was going to enlighten, educate, and entertain. It would be unforgettable. And so on, and so on. Has any one of you out there been disappointed like this? Was it by a person, an ideology, a philosophy, a course in school, a dead-end job, what? And yet, I believe this show framed precisely that question, in its own way. After thinking this show over, I think it was not only worth watching the first time, but multiple times. Some people don't think its worthwhile or instructive to observe the selling out of the soul, maybe that's just hitting too close to home for a show (any show) that's supposed to make me forget about the daily routine.
Was it immoral? People, it's television. You know what you are getting into, don't you? No one promised an exhilarating, scintillating joie de vivre, with singing, dancing, and a great love story, or alternately, easily identifiable heroes, antagonists, and some viscerally satisfying sex and violence. Isn't there enough of that already?
This show is not for those who possess all the answers and a certitude in life, where you've got it all mapped out, you are sure of your place in the world, that it is immutable, and just the right slice of heaven assuredly awaits you in the afterlife. If this is you, this show will surely irritate you.
However, if you are troubled for reasons quite uncertain, perhaps suspecting that there is more going on in the world, and in your life, than what is revealed to you; that people feel justified to lie on a routine basis, and that business is premised on selling us on the idea that they act in everyone's best interests; that you strive to avoid the notion of a unified conspiracy, but it always seems  that controlling the populus and maintaining clear authority is the ultimate governmental/societal agenda, well, have I got a show for you. But please don't think the show is smugly self-satisfied, or esoteric and obfuscative solely to be a riddle. It's not really meant to be a riddle, really. And it's not all that smug or self-satisfied either. It may get a little esoteric, so what. It's certainly not impossible either.
Dystopias aren't meant to be fun. The question here is, how did this happen to us?

If you've read to the end of this review, it's likely because you want to know whether this is worth buying or renting. Honestly, the show requires some level of concentration and reflection. And patience. How do you like your shows? Easy and breezy? That's not this. Nor is it a grinding downer. There are moments of quirkiness and wry humor also. It is clever, on many levels. Those who hate it have a right to, of course, but their reasons, to me it seems, are so uninformative. Of course it's not like the original show. But oddly, it does work as a modern counterpart, in my opinion. It's daring, risky, and knows that sometimes it just doesn't seem to all add up. That's where you come in. Do you trust yourself to be fair and open-minded, to give something like this show a hearing without making demands upon it, or must the show prove that its worthwhile entertainment in the first 15 minutes? Do I have to make the same promise to you?
Was this review worth reading? Or do you want these last few minutes of your life back from me? Sorry, I'll have to be selfish on this one and say I warned you at the outset.
Maybe it should be described as 'serious fun.' That's when you delve into something a little more sophisticated with the expectation that there may be some obstacles along the way, but the author does have a point of view, a statement of artistry to make. And that it is worthwhile to explore this with the artist. This is how one should approach the Prisoner, in my opinion.",1264809600,20,6419,4.595466434176112

3986959,1,B002U0KHNS,"I wanted to keep an open mind thinking maybe it will be different but a new twist on things. I thought what a great opportunity to make an update based on the Internet, CCTV, Echelon, DARPA, etc. What a great opportunity to project into the future possible further threats to our future. Here were some signs that I thought it wasn't going to be good even though they may seem trivial:

Instead of flatscreen TVs used the old tube TV's and equipment seem 1990's. No advance surveillance. Big brother was a wimp. Their idea of monitoring #6 was with binoculars or drilling a hole into the wall. The village wasn't built scan and monitor people and looked mostly like a bunch of shacks built in the desert. Forget any provocative  architecture or camera angles. Forget the scene of the command center monitoring every move.
Futuristic village? No, actually it was primitive. Looked like it was filmed in Prim, Nevada and they built some shacks for the village. It looked like a backlot filmed in the middle of the desert. They drove around in smoking gas guzzlers that looked like my mother's 1950 Studebaker. The prisoner was an idiot. I would have found out how food was coming in because the village had no farms...just some shacks in the middle of the desert. Instead the prisoner spent his time crying or having multiple flashback. I think even his flashbacks had flashbacks but couldn't tell since the editing was done by an idiot. He wasn't connected to the Village and could have just easily had him stay in a hotel room and do his flashbacks.
(really a deal breaker): #6 was a wimp who cried a lot and was manipulated by various women...not the #6 we know. Actually I was more sympathetic toward #2 who I wanted after a while, to blow #6's  [...]  head off. Instead of #6 taking control of the situation and ultimately taking over the village #2 just cried a lot. When #6 said the famous words, ""I am not a number but a free man"" it seemed more like a question from the new Prisoner. He also referred to himself as number 6 FREQUENTLY, where the old Prisoner would never say that. Such understanding and why this is important and other sublties lost on the writers and director.  NO HUMOR. Too much sad and mand, too much crying and some people committing suicide. Prisoner updated to the 21 century with the obligatory homosexual scenes.

It was very confusing. Almost everything was a flashback and some of the flashbacks had flashbacks. The only thing I can guess is #6 was having a mental background or too much LSD but even LSD would be more interesting since this Prisoner was drab and the biggest crime was that it was boring.

Maybe someone else liked it and took something out of it but I didn't. The producers could have updated it, made it a little funny and relevant today but looked like it was written by someone who had a mental breakdown (a boring one at that) in the 1980's.

Even my review might make it more exciting than it really was.",1264377600,7,2962,4.554511278195489
3986960,4,B002U0KHNS,"Not so much a re-make, more a completely different series all together, with some common threads, such as the individual vs the system. Some homage to the original - the obvious like rover, and the almost subliminal in visibility like the penny farthing and the Caterham car.

Bleaker, and also more visually stunning from the location.

As there is only one 2 and one 6, so we see a lot more of what motivates 2. Not so much of a relationship 2 with 6 though more development between 2 and family members. The personalities are very different as well. Pre village, 6 is an observer rather than a field agent, so fewer fist fights and less running around, more watching to find what is going on.

The original had more impact, probably because there was almost nothing like it around. This version comes after all kinds of film and TV series exploring this area, so we are more used to it. In the original, it was apparent fairly early what was wanted - answering one resignation question would lead to eventual loyalty or corruption of the individual. Here there is much more of a mystery of what 2 wants from 6, and indeed the motivations may change gradually and for good reasons in hindsight.

This series wraps up more tightly - seems like the script ending was known before completion, while in the original the writers had little idea of how to finish it.

4 stars - a good series but there is more competition in the genre so harder to be completely new.",1263600000,60,1462,4.5227272727272725
3986961,1,B002U0KHNS,"The original, 1960's series ""The Prisoner"" (with Patrick McGoohan), was, is, and always will be a MASTERPIECE.  And I recommend that everyone see THAT series, not this one.  This incredibly lame ""reimagining"" has virtually nothing in common with the original, and on top of that it's just tedious, pointless, and boring.

The original (17 episode) series was entertaining, visually impressive, and fast paced; featured very clever dialog, great/memorable music, a keen sense of humor, and contained numerous IMPORTANT political warnings against big-government totalitarianism.  Warning people to be skeptical of friendly-faced, all-controlling, supposedly ""democratic"" governance.  The political message of the original was strongly and proudly libertarian, and should be required viewing for all who live in ""free"" countries (and if possible should also be seen by those living in unfree countries!).  But Hollywood liberals hate libertarianism, so they stripped that element entirely out of their new version.  Leaving - essentially nothing.

If you know the flavor of the original series, you might suspect that THIS ""prisoner"" was made solely to keep people from seeing, appreciating, and learning from the original series.  That is, the liberal Hollywood ""warders"" who run our governments now, made this garbage in order to ruin the original, for fear that those who saw the original would seek their own freedom.  Shame on those who had any part in bringing this version to the screen.  Skip this, get the original series, be entertained by it, understand and spread its message of freedom!",1263427200,13,1596,5.5

I tried to watch it, and after several hours I finally realized I didn't HAVE to watch this!  Just cuz I had looked forward to it for so long, did not mean I had to keep torturing myself to watch the WHOLE thing, so I finally turned it off.

3986966,4,B002U0KHNS,"Firstly, I am a fan of the original Prisoner series.  It would seem the viewers are divided on this new reworking of the show, and I was skeptical.

I've seen the first 4 episodes of the new mini-series and I am enjoying it thoroughly.  It's not a twee, or funny as the original, and maybe lacks that humorous edge that I think only the dear departed PM could pull off, but it does follow and expand upon the original premise of the show.

Yes, there are some changes, particularly location, and I think it was brave of the makers not to go down the route of filming in (or on a set of) Portmeirion.  I think it paid off, although the new Village is more of a Town if you ask me...a little too large perhaps.

I certainly am keen to see the remaining episodes and likely will buy this DVD on its release to find out the conclusion of the series.

You do have to go into this with an open mind, even if you have been a fan of the original - accept it as it's own piece of work rather than a comparative.  I very much liken it to comparing the BBC Life on Mars with the US remake.  Both were strong in their own right, and although the US version didn't fare well (and had an awful conclusion), it had captivating stories and good acting.  The new Prisoner is of this same mould - don't compare it with the classic original - accept it for what it is and it reaps rewards.",1261353600,5,1370,4.116541353383458
3986967,5,B002U0KHNS,"It appears as though the community is divided on this one.  I am a fan of the original and generally don't watch ""remakes"" of classic TV shows because they have been universally dreadful, until now.  I initially started watching because of Ian McKellan (who was great by the way) and I was then completely mesmerized by Jim Caviezel, who I had not seen before and who forced me to watch the series in it's entirety.  I rewatched the entire original series soon after this and then rewatched this again.  I was very pleased by the number of references to the original that were contained in the new version; (it would be a great game to see how many you could spot). The creative team for this series clearly had great respect for the original.  No one could replace PM and no one is trying to here.  I look at this as an ""updated"" (afterall the cold war is over, guys) version with the equivalent of the ""cold war spy"" of our information age.  This ""version"" pays great homage to the original while being true to itself and it's time.  It made me realize that ""The Prisoner"" concept is adaptable to any time and that the time itself dictates the characteristics of the main character.  If you are a fan of the original, and you watch this with an open mind, I am sure you will enjoy it.",1260662400,13,1286,4.3924050632911396
3986968,1,B002U0KHNS,"Those who have commented about this series without seeing the original do not know whereof they write.  The original series went beyond mere entertainment (and it was very entertaining) but also stimulated the viewer into thinking about subjects such as illegal incarceration, autonomy, the illusion of democracy, identity, education, truth, life, death, manipulation, propaganda, loyalty, war and violence (as well as innumerable other topics). As a youth, I was profoundly influenced by the exploration of the concepts in this series.

Plus, I loved the car.  Rover was cool too.

I find it hard to believe that anyone could be remotely influenced by any of the ideas in this mini-series remake.  In fact, I couldn't find any profound ideology in this mini-series.

If one had not seen the original series, this new rendition would have had to have been completely incomprehensible.

The fundamentals of the show were missing. Number Six was not defiant or angry, merely befuddled.  Number Two was not desperately seeking information from Number Six while under the scrutiny of an anonymous Number One.  He was also acting aimlessly.

Everyone was wandering around as if they were in a dream (wow - a spoiler!)

After waiting so long for something to be done with the Prisoner property; and with so many hard core fans craving to view a remake, I am surprised this weak series was the best effort that the entertainment industry could muster.

For better alternatives for those of you who would love to see more shows similar to the original Prisoner, I would recommend:

1) Danger Man (TV Series)
2) Secret Agent (TV Series)
3) Kings and Desperate Men (VHS Movie with some familiar faces)
4) Shattered Visage (Graphic Novel sequel)
5) Nowhere Man (TV Series with a similar flow to the Prisoner)
6) Sleuth (with Olivier & Caine - a movie about mind games)
7) The Game (with M. Douglas - another mind game movie)
8) The Prisoner Original Movie Scripts (Two Volumes also containing original series material which was not used)

It is a pity that producers have waited forty years for the deaths of Patrick McGoohan and Leo McKern, just to insure that they would not appear in any sequels.  The graphic novel ""Shattered Visage"" was created 20 years ago with appropriately aged Numbers 2 & 6, undoubtedly with a movie sequel in mind which would have included these beloved actors.  Another missed opportunity was that McGoohan's own sequel was not used.

Perhaps in forty years hence a better sequel will be made.",1260057600,141,2511,4.940476190476191
3986969,1,B002U0KHNS,"I can never understand why things have to be ""re-imagined"" when there was nothing wrong with the imagining in the first place. 6 (never NUMBER 6) winds up in the Village for no discernible reason and attempts to get out, though why anyone should try to leave a Butlitz-style holiday camp in the middle of the desert where everyone has a smashing time is beyond me.
The only things that remain that remain constant about this hodge-podge are the visual references, which abound, and 2. Ian McKellen does his best with it but the whole thing falls flat and I couldn't wait for the end which, needless to say, was even more murky and muddled than the original. I kept thinking ""Pierce Brosnan"" every time Jim Caviezel was about but that didn't help.
Maybe I'm being too much of a purist but to condense a 17-part series down into 6 episodes does not attempt to do the show justice. There is no depth to anyone's character and 2 alternates, confusingly, between loving father and husband and tyrant. Where did all this come from?
What a mess. It shows again that you shouldn't monkey with success. Forty-two years ago I watched the original. I loved it then as I do now. I didn't understand the end but, looking back, maybe no-one was supposed to. If I'm still going in another forty-two, I still won't understand why this was made.

3986970,2,B002U0KHNS,"I have to admit, I only watched ""Arrival"" and the difference to the same episode of the original was stark.  MacGoohan's concept was about the individual in a conformistic enviornment.  Number Six knew who HE was but not who was running the Village.  Their bent was to make him say why he resigned.  His struggle was that he didn't know who was trying to get the answers: his own government or the other side.  Those who lambast this thing take heart, what Patrick MacGoohan accomplished over four decades ago still has resonance and will be watched, enjoyed and intrepreted long after this attempt is forgotten.  Sometimes reimagining works: BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is a great example.  Sometimes it fails: THE NIGHT STALKER is the latter.  These things succeed or fail because those who are trying to reinvent either understand what made the original work or they don't.",1259280000,10,869,4.944827586206896

The acting is terribly wooden and the pace is incredibly slow.  I found myself not caring why things were happening to ""6"" in my struggle to understand what was happening.  A murky storyline doomed this project. I cannot recommend this program.",1259280000,58,404,4.333333333333333
3986972,5,B002U0KHNS,"I'm mostly just throwing this 5-star review out there to balance all the rediculous 1-star reviews, but I'd say the 2009 Prisoner mini-series deserves at least four stars.  If you're a fan of well-written, well-crafted, well-acted science fiction, you should check it out.  It's not like that sort of thing comes along very often.

I can't believe how badly fans of the original series are savaging this one, simple because it's not exactly like the TV show from 40 years ago.  Do yourself a favor and ignore any vehemently negative reviews you see that contain comparisons of the two series.  The 2009 Prisoner shares some basic elements with the 1967 version, but it's a completely different story, and a satisfying one that actually has an ending and will keep you thinking for days after seeing it.",1258934400,13,802,4.867647058823529
3986973,3,B002U0KHNS,"The new ""Prisoner"" isn't as bad as some are saying, but it's also not very good. I do love the original but I also came to the new version with an open mind. Any fan of the original series who's being honest, including McGoohan himself, will admit that only about half of the episodes were truly great - the others range from mediocre to excruciatingly bad, and even the great ones have some low points. But still, when it was good it was outstanding, and that's why you kept watching. It's obvious to me now that without McGoohan's driving presence, both in the leading role and as a creative force, the idea of ""The Prisoner"" isn't necessarily so compelling. Sure, all of the basic elements are still there in the new version, but I think this remake owes a lot more to ""Lost"" than it does to its source material. I found most of it boring, a constant series of more ""mysteries"" to be solved which, even when they are revealed, aren't interesting. And while James Caviezel is clearly a good actor, his Number Six, while cast in the role of a lone rebel, is not especially heroic or even sympathetic. McGoohan's Six was unquestionably a hero - so forceful and determined that even when he sometimes lost a particular battle, you knew that he would never give up in his war against the Village. Caviezel's Six is a typical hero for today's TV - so full of self-doubt that you get the impression that he could crack at any moment. He's also not very likable and about as fleshed-out as a cardboard cutout. We knew just as little about McGoohan's Six's background, but McGoohan's performance was so distinctive that the viewer could feel he could relate to Six just after the first episode. And the Village, in the original, was downright eerie, with an atmosphere straight out of Kafka. The Village in the new version just seems banal. I always thought that one of the most disturbing facets of the original was the fact that everyone in the Village could remember their previous life, but was forced to act out a charade of enjoying their vapid lives. In the new Village, since most people have no recollection of their earlier life, they just seem like the kind of people you might see at the mall. Even McKellen's Number Two, who seems more concerned with his son and drugging his wife than in ruling the Village, lacks any real sense of menace. The various Twos in the original were scary precisely because they were so inhuman - in this version, one gets the impression that running the Village is just a hobby he pursues in his spare time away from his family. So, overall, I feel it was worth watching this, but it's certainly not destined to be as groundbreaking or original as its predecessor.",1258934400,9,2701,4.5711340206185564
3986974,4,B002U0KHNS,"First off, I have watched the original The Prisoner DVDs. Must-watch. Crazy beyond compare and easy to see how that show influenced everything from Babylon 5 to Lost to X-Files, you name it.
But this review is for AMC's mini-series.  I knew it to be a re-imagining.  (Battlestar, anyone?) I was not disappointed.  Sir Ian McKellan is pitch-perfect as Number Two, all nuance and in-jokes and ferocious determination, yet with a sentimental side.  And Jim Caviezel gives a more human take on Number Six, he is not perfect or immune to the goings-on around him, he does not present himself as a know-it-all.  While Six seems to take a lot in stride, he is still chewing on things.
In some ways this film reminded me of Dark City, which was no doubt influenced by the original Prisoner series.  This is a compliment.  There are tints of the Matrix as well.  But I like the fact that this is a multi-layered set-up, there are many things going on at many levels, and in the end I felt so intrigued by the concept of what was going on that I still can't get it out of my head.
And that makes it a cautionary tale.
How far do we go to protect people?  To ""help"" those who are troubled?  Where do we draw the line?  What is manifested out of our desires, our greed, our nonchalance, our vanity, our pain...or what COULD be?  This is something we need to think about as technology and medicine advance apace.  We are going to find ourselves in a Village similar to this one day.  Is it the direction we want to go?
Many deliciously bizarre and gorgeous visuals capture one's attention here, but in the end, a pang and a lingering fascination with the subject matter are what resonate most.",1258761600,14,1680,4.465573770491804

I loved the abstract nature of the series and how it lent itself to multiple interpretations.  Moreover, McGoohan himself encouraged this.

That said, I bought this for Hayley Atwell, who impressed me in Captain America and in The Pillars of the Earth.  Unfortunately the series teases the viewer with glimpses of her until the fourth episode.  While she appears throughout, it's her last appearance in the series.  Ian McKellen's performance seems forced and inauthentic.  Jim Caviezel's performance has echoes of McGoohan's rebellion without any of the real substance, and Lennie James is wasted as one of the other Villagers.  The end of the series is truly unsatisfying.  Fans of Person of Interest might be interested in this as a dovetail to the surveillance culture of that series and for Caviezel, but as lame as the final season ended up being, this Prisoner remake is far worse.",1513814400,,1079,4.789189189189189

A lot of people disparaged this miniseries because they were expecting something more like the original, I think.  Both should be enjoyed on their own merits.  Without dropping any spoilers, this incarnation does bear a closer relationship to the original (at least in what/where the Village is) than most would admit.  I encourage fans to closely re-watch the final episode of the original - ""Fall Out"", consider the implications put forth there and consider how that might apply to this miniseries.  You might come to some interesting conclusions.  Your mileage will vary, of course.

The video on this release looks beautiful.  Sadly, the audio is only a 2.0 (even in the Spanish track - weird considering it's a Spanish release).  There are no extras of any sort.  If you already own the American release (which is DVD only), you might want to hold on to it if you like the meager extras included on it.

This set is listed as Region Free.  Those with sharp eyes might note that the back cover of the set notes that the video is listed in PAL format (as opposed to NTSC), which would make it virtually unplayable in most US players and TV sets.

There are cameo omages to McGoohan's epic. Oh, look, a bicycle. Oh look, a Rover balloon in slo motion reverse. Oh look, a jacket with white piping. Oh, that's it then...
I had no intention of comparing this with the original, but they kept reminding us. They called it The Prisoner, too.
