8567320,5,B00BEM1ZJ8,I liked it...I was warned before the purchase of its short duration; still I enjoyed it.,1445126400,,88,4.5625
8567321,5,B00BEM1ZJ8,Enjoyed this short.  It was well done and the casting was excellent. We hope they make a full feature soon!,1388448000,,107,4.35
8567322,1,B00BEM1ZJ8,"A very melodramatic and to some extent shallow ""take"" on the life of Snow. Pales in comparison to The Ghost Map by Johnson.  Some of the scenes evoke a feeling for Victorian London... but that can also be found in Mayhew... or in Polanski's Oliver Twist.",1379808000,2,254,4.521739130434782
8567323,5,B00BEM1ZJ8,"This short film is an impressive blend of historical and educational content with visually capturing the dramatic experience of the beginning of epidemiology. The casting, script and production bring this story to life in an exciting and vivid way. I recommend this film for both educational and enjoyment purposes.",1378771200,,315,5.448979591836735
8567324,4,B00BEM1ZJ8,"This is a highly entertaining movie. Although it is only 22 minutes, it does a nice job of getting to the heart of the matter and still keeping you entertained. It's a nice history on the father of epidemiology. Even if you are not a public health professional you will enjoy this film.",1378339200,,286,4.415094339622642
8567325,5,B00BEM1ZJ8,"You have to realize this is an independent project. There isn't any WB or MGM money bankrolling it
 Having said that, there are no executives trying to ""reach"" every audience. It is a great film, I would of loved it in highschool or in an ecology class. I supported it when it was trying to come out. Acting is top notch. As an MD/MBA in healthcare management, it is a great history lesson because we still use the basic methods Snow started back at the pump. If you're not an avid lower of evidence based medicine, need not worry, the acting is more than sufficient. It left me as a viewer questioning the background of each character, there was a lot of mystery to the background of the characters. I feel that this film with more $$$ would of haven been great. It is just hard to please an audience who believes Abe Lincoln was a vampire slayer.",1378166400,2,848,4.367088607594937
8567326,5,B00BEM1ZJ8,"I spent my career in public health so this short movie was great. I think it would be a great teaching tool for science classes at the middle to high school level--hopefully it will give some students the nudge to study epidemiology later.  Made me proud to have chosen the career path that I did.  A great book that goes further into detail about this subject and appeared to me to be the outline for this movie is The Ghost Map:  The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic--and How it Changed Sciences, Cities, and the Modern World by Steven Johnson.",1378080000,,556,4.54
8567327,1,B00BEM1ZJ8,"... this is the length of the film. It's 22 minutes for ""Snow the Movie"". Now I feel little bit stupid for not paying attention to that. Oh and if i did not make myself clear enough: Yes it is 24.99 $ for 22 minutes. This is the whole movie, not just chapter one. Maybe I should look for the soundtrack on DVD, probably 3.23 minutes including all songs....",1376524800,2,356,4.173913043478261
