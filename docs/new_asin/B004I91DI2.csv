The content is full.  Instruction is clear and effective.  The instructors are oh so pleasant and each one accomplishes their goal.  I had no idea that I was getting full choreographies!  YES!  There is plenty of time built in for practice.

This is for the intermediate and advanced Middle Eastern dancers and a very good investment.

8430411,5,B004I91DI2,I love the 20 minute broken down format from different teachers.  It gives you your money's worth because it's not the same person over and over and all the finalists really know what they're talking about.  I hope the next Final 6 is as awesome as this one.,1353801600,,258,4.354166666666667
8430412,5,B004I91DI2,"I love the variety on this dvd. It's worth 5 stars for Sherena's section alone! She is an excellent instructor; please please please give us more of her! With the Final 6, you get 6 mini workshops about 30 to 45 minutes each. In addition to Sherena's section, I really enjoy Victoria's and Yvonne's sections. These three have a lot to offer in their sections. Shems' secection is good, but more for beginner level dancers. I wasn't crazy about Karolina's or Andalee's sections--they were nice to do once, but I doubt I will do them again. The nice thing is that more time is given to what I consider the better pieces, so Sherena's, Victoria's, and Yvonne's sections are each about 45 minutes long, and they all have extended practice options. Nice!",1308960000,11,749,4.681818181818182
