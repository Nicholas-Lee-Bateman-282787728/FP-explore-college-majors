8373835,5,B002MD2Z1A,"I've seen the film elsewhere, and am going on good faith that the DVD has English subtitles as stated. To me, BAXTER VERA BAXTER is Duras as film director at her summit: all of her tentative introduction of words on the soundtrack, concern and doubt over the substance of language; critical engagement with, aesthetic remodeling for, lingering contemplation of and sensual pleasure in presenting feminine and architectural beauty; solitude, loneliness, despair, conscienceless capitalism, haunting patriarchy, but also yearning hope and offscreen delight and happiness, which we hear continuously in the background, neither dulling nor overbearing, lying only a jaunt down a walking path away for both the characters and in a broader, philosophical sense, the film itself. Three Duras DVDs purporting to contain English subs, this, NATALIE GRANGER, and INDIA SONG are supreme masterpieces. I hope another two, WOMAN OF THE GANGES and AGATHA, will come soon. Duras' fine, delicate, aesthetically norm-shifting and politically disobedient (but so gently done) films are best appreciated seeing in chronological order.",1499385600,,1115,5.682634730538922

<<<A study of a cold, remote thirtyish woman whose husband, a building operator, has practically sold her to get rid of a gambling debt. -BFI>>> Add: Style nouveau roman, Delphine Seyrig's talents wasted.

Marguerite Duras (1914-96) was born in southern Vietnam and lost her father at age four. The family savings of twenty years bought the family a small plot in Cambodia, but everything was lost in a single season's flooding. The disaster killed her mother as a result. After high school in Saigon, Miss Duras left Indochina to study law in Paris. As a young woman, she worked as a secretary in France's Ministry of Colonies from 1935 to 1941 before becoming a writer. She wrote 34 novels from 1943 to 1993, and became an enduring part of Paris's intellectual elite. In addition to her writing, she also directed about 16 films. For the film India Song (1975), she won France's Cinema Academy Grand Prix. She claimed to have rescued French president Franois Mitterand during World War II, when he was a resistance fighter and remained a friend and unconditional campaigner. Her most noted novel is ""L'Amant"", the story of a girl, from a poor French family in Indochina, who becomes the mistress of a wealthy Indochinese notable's son. --IMDb

8373838,4,B002MD2Z1A,"One warning: this edition is Region 1 (US/Canada standard) but it is in French with no subtitles. That said, it's a lovely, rather modest film which attempts to depict a woman's loneliness. In most of the film, Vera Baxter is sitting in a room, where her ruminations (which often take the form of a conversation with an unnamed woman) convey a sense of her isolation.

It is hard to explain Duras's methodoloy, how she is able to make the tentative emotions of a woman seem so piercing and profound. This was her method in her novels, and as a filmmaker she was often able to find the perfect sound-image combination to convey her themes. BAXTER VERA BAXTER isn't one of her masterpieces (the lead actress is somehow less than overwhelming, a problem also found in Duras's earlier film DESTROY SHE SAID), but it is a very beautiful film nevertheless.",1257638400,10,850,4.704697986577181
