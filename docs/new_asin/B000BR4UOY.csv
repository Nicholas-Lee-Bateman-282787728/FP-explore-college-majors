8091461,4,B000BR4UOY,"I really liked this video. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not heavy on the vocal technique side of things, but it doesn't need to be. Gaye very artfully shows how to integrate sorytelling/acting techniques into performance, with the end goal of making the audience respond emotionally. It's something not covered enough in vocal training IMO.

A couple nitpicks: she loses count at a certain point and arguably only offers 16 of the advertised 17 tips. Watch it closely and take good notes and it jumps right out at you. Also, she discusses Howlin' Wolf's howl, and completely misses the difference between a howl and a growl. She discusses his distinctive growl. His ""howl"" was, by his own admission, a botched attempt at yodeling like Jimmie Rodgers, one that he turned into a personal signature (this is discussed in a taped interview included with his Chess boxed set). The growl is given some discussion here, as is a variation on a stage whisper, and anyone who wants to drill deeper on this less-explored technique might want to check out Melissa Cross's Zen of Screaming to learn how to do this well without doing damage to their voice.",1490486400,,1158,4.819095477386934
8091462,5,B000BR4UOY,"I don't often write reviews, but I really feel like this DVD merited a good one.  Adegbalola's presentation was warm and engaging and also made apparent her strong knowledge of the blues.  Also, I liked the fact that she didn't set hard and fast ""rules"" to follow but instead encouraged each singer to find their own voice and make each song their own using a variety of techniques, including historical research and documentation.  I think her discussion on appropriateness of repertoire, whether or not you agree with it or not, is an important and very salient issue when addressing topics such as blues or jazz, especially very early pieces.  The variety of tunes chosen as demonstration was very enjoyable.  I really feel like this DVD is worth watching several times for serious vocalists.  There's a ton of information in it and much of it can be applied to give a very different feel to singing.",1405987200,,903,4.7935483870967746
8091463,3,B000BR4UOY,"The information and content is interesting and delivered in quite a relaxed manner.  It is a bit dated in it's look and anecdotes but, still not a bad addition to a collection of vocal approaches.",1398297600,,196,4.6
8091464,4,B000BR4UOY,This is not a vocal training video. It is a tutorial on singing with soul... on really being aware of what you're singing about. There are many who could use this type of insight.,1265068800,2,179,4.294117647058823
8091465,5,B000BR4UOY,"This is an excellent training or coaching mini-course for Blues vocals. In fact, most of the 17 key points that Gaye teaches are pertinent to singing any kind of song. Gaye is a delightful person, and a superb Blues vocalist. She delivers the material in a friendly, easy-to-understand manner. She demonstrates most of the 17 key points by singing parts of or entire Blues tunes. Her piano playing accompanist is also excellent. One thing I especially liked about Gaye's presentation is that she doesn't teach rigid, dogmatic rules. After all, rigidity and dogma certainly don't fit the soul and free-spiritedness of Blues. She humbly says that (paraphrasing) ... ""these are things that I've found work for me"" ... ""you can try them, and some may work for you, and some may not"". Gaye has a great, warm personality, and when I watched the DVD, I felt like she was a friend who was talking only to me.

Based on Gaye's delightful DVD, I plan to attend her Blues Vocals workshop at the Augusta Heritage Center BLUES WEEK this summer at Davis and Elkins College in Elkins, West Virginia.

I'd be happy to reply to you about this great DVD if you wish:

8091466,3,B000BR4UOY,"I bought this in hopes of how o become a ""screaming"" blues singer.  It does not really address your voce or voice development per se, but rather on how to get a message across.  There is a smidgeon on ""the growl"" but not much.  I haven't yet found what I am looking for, but this is not it.  I found the title a little misleading since it doesn't teach you HOW to sing.  Also the songs it uses are old blues tunes like Stagger Lee, etc.  Its message is important in making songs more effective, but just not in developing a contemporary blues voice.",1249603200,5,549,4.230769230769231
8091467,5,B000BR4UOY,"Dear friends. Regularly i do not take any moment to write reviews BUT this is NOT a regular training video.

I do own many guitar training videos and lately some more about recording and they all show you the technical stuff you need to learn. What sets this one apart is that you will learn how to sing from your heart.

Singing from the heart is possibly on e of the most difficult task to develop because normally we are not ""connected to it"" in a musical way.

Since the video start, this woman talks to you with a smile and refers to you honestly an as a friend making the learning very easy and simple. Once you get to know your heart, you got it made.

In short, Singing the Blues?.  This is your first and last training video!.  Fell free to throw away everything else you had bought.",1202428800,7,792,4.246666666666667
