5108772,5,B007RKFXLC,First of all we loved Marjorie Main in all the movies we have seen her in. She could be a tough cookie or as gentle as a lamb.,1362873600,3,126,3.5357142857142856
5108773,3,B007RKFXLC,"Unless you are a diehard Marjorie Main fan, you might want to catch this on TCM instead of purchasing it.  Not up to snuff with other MGM/Main vehicles.  Still, she is always a delight.  It's just not a film I will be watching more than once.",1362182400,,242,4.217391304347826
5108774,4,B007RKFXLC,"I bought this movie only to see Marjorie Main in something else besides Ma & Pa Kettle. I liked the movie, it was fun to watch, and I would share it with a friend. I think movies are subjective and people buy them for all kinds of reasons. If you like MM, it's nice to see her in something else!",1362182400,2,295,3.933333333333333
5108775,4,B007RKFXLC,"Three unmarried matchmakers try to pair an eighteen-year-old girl with a thirty-one-year old man.  That's the main thread running through most of this film.  The rest involves a bear, a supposedly orphaned baby, and involuntary institutionalization.  The plot goes from crazy slapstick (Marjorie Main roller-skating) to a nephew forced to commit his aunt to an asylum (on dubious grounds) by a judge who clearly hates her.  They had me laughing right up until the story turned south with the aforementioned plot twist that was particularly nasty to watch and oddly out of place in a comedy (hence 4 stars instead of 5).
 I must confess, I had never heard of this film nor could I find much about it (it isn't even listed in Marjorie Main's filmography).  For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and I do plan on keeping it for future viewings.  As Marjorie Main is one of my favorite actresses, buying this wasn't a problem.  That it also starred Zasu Pitts was a bonus.  It's a DVD-R product.  The film does show its age with lines, spots, and crackles (as I grew up watching black and white films in poor condition I didn't mind this a bit).
It's unconventional to say the least.
I'm glad I took a chance and bought.",1345852800,9,1230,4.652777777777778

8521351,5,B007RKFXLC,"A friend of mine who knew how much I love Marjorie Main sent me this. I love this movie. I adore Marjorie Main and she did a really good acting job in this movie. This movie was different from her Ma Kettle roles but I enjoyed it thoroughly. It showed a different part of Marjorie Main at least to me. The entire movie was excellent. Zuzu Pitts was a treat, too. The three old maids and the baby were wonderful. Very good, nice clean movie. I recommend it to Marjorie Main fans.",1426377600,2,478,4.206521739130435
8521352,5,B007RKFXLC,"I love Marjorie Main, I buy anything I see that she's in as long as it's on DVD.  I have all the Ma and Pa Kettle movies, wish they made more.  This movie is a welcome addition to my collection.  I will watch this movie many times in the coming years.",1419206400,,251,3.8823529411764706
8521353,5,B007RKFXLC,"Funny. very, very, funny.",1416700800,,25,5.5
8521354,5,B007RKFXLC,"Three fine character actresses in a touching story. Marjorie Main is more than capable of carrying the story as the title character Tish, backed up by the always delightful Zasu Pitts and Aline McMahon, plus Guy Kibbee and a fine supporting cast. The story is by turns slapstick and poignant but never a downer.",1374710400,2,311,4.777777777777778
8521355,5,B007RKFXLC,"Marjorie Main is hilarious!  This movie always leaves me with a good feeling.  Clean, good old comedy worth keeping in your DVD library.",1366070400,4,136,4.869565217391305
