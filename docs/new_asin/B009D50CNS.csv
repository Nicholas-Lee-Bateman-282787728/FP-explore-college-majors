8540102,5,B009D50CNS,"I just received my LA Law Season 6 from amazon.uk.  Also purchased Season 4 & 5 earlier from amazon.uk.  The company, Revelation, that released LA Law Seasons 4 -6 has done a remarkable job in putting LA Law on DVD.  The picture is clear, crisp.  Do not compare it with the release of Seasons 1-3 by Shout Factory which cannot compare to the releases by Revelation.  The sound is wonderful.  My husband has severe hearing problems and I was concerned he could not hear the movie as it has no subtitles.  But he could hear almost everything except when people whispered.

The firm is in financial crisis at the beginning of Season Six & is forced to rent out office space.  Susan Bloom an entertainment lawyer makes an impact on the staff immediately and Grace returns to LA.  With the new powerhouse of lawyers the firm may have hit the jackpot.

The performances are intense  with a changing cast.  Fans will not be disappointed and I will not spoil your enjoyment with too many details. except to say the quality is terrific and it is close to a recent release of a new film.

Please note you will need a region free DVD player.",1432166400,7,1130,4.4754901960784315
