8340677,4,B001T79BLM,"Probably, folks of the Philippines grow up faster and mature speedily than in some other places, in which ten year old boys read scholastic books and play Nintendo rather, than do research on human sexuality for their fifteen year old comrades exploring their teen urges practically.

Perhaps not the poorest on local standards, a young adult seduced his twenty five year old uncle, who paid an ultimate price for his lustful deed.

Incest is a grim reality and such twist in relationship depicted, one could say, just loses a broad general viewer audience of this particular DVD because of a trailer presenting a homo-erotic production that is unavoidably watched before the really good movie. Such an ambiguous technicality grounded a four star mark of this produce.

8340680,4,B001T79BLM,"This is a nice film but nothing to write home about...the story is incomplete, the character a bit too dramatic and the boy lovely to see on screen.
I enjoyed but it's not worth the money some sellers are asking for.  Rent, see it and if you really love it you can purchase.",1304899200,,274,4.169811320754717
8340681,5,B001T79BLM,"Despite its limited resources, 'Antonio's Secret' is captivating viewing. Shot on a tight budget in The Philippines, with only a hand-held camera and a mic at his disposal, director Joselito Altarejos managed to turn out a moving portrayal of the blossoming sexual awareness of 15-year-old lad Antonio. 'AS' provides a look-in on Antonio's sexual experiments, while simultaneously discovering his sexual preference. Both items are blended beautifully, not shunning explicit scenes. They're no cheap thrill, but add an extra dimension to the subject raised here. Antonio 'treasures' his 'secret' and only lets on to his best pal, who's only too eager to know a thing or two about being gay. Mum's brov, who comes to stay, puts paid to Antonio's gentle mental and physical development. He does so, with horrific consequences. Cinematically, 'AS' may come across as rather amateurish, what with a mediocore soundtrack and unclear images. Scenes are shot rather haphazzardly and may seem like any other homevideo.
Please, take this for granted, as this film is produced a far cry from extensive Hollywood filmfactories. See it for what it is; thought-provoking and soulsearching. A gem in its own right!",1286150400,6,1199,5.315789473684211
8340682,2,B001T79BLM,"Let's keep it brief. A so-so story with hand-held shaky camera, mostly out of focus or filmed on super-8, definitely not DVD (let alone BluRay) quality.  The entire picture breathes ""cheap"". Avoid.",1280102400,,197,5.15625
8340683,5,B001T79BLM,"The English sub-titles make the story easier for non-Tagalog speakers to understand. The actors are very convincing and very professional. The directing and story line are top-notch. Ang Lihim ni Antonio should be a cornerstone to any collection of fine ""indy"" films. This movie demonstrates that independent film makers from the Philippines are capable of producing World-Class movies.",1258416000,5,386,5.672413793103448
