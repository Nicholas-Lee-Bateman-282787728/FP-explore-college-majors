I'm not even sure how he found them because as far as I know they're not on TV anymore, but he did and he loves them.  I went on a search for doodle bop movies because the kids do not have cable in their room and I came across this.  It's not what I expected.  It's a cartoon version of the doodlebops with a few short episodes that teach lessons if various topics (the one that comes to mind was about how if you want to be good at something you need to practice.)  my 2 year old loves it and my 6 year old tollarates it.  So it's a win win!",1481846400,,609,3.832
