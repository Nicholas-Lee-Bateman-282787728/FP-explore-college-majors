1197986,5,B000009RXS,"This was one of my all-time favorites when I was a kid, and now that I've finally seen it again after 20 years I'm pleased to find that my sense of humor was razor-sharp even then. Why ""Animalympics"" isn't a  staple on Cartoon Network and Blockbuster is beyond me.
As if you need  an explanation, it's about an Olympics starring animals. Just like network  TV coverage you have your anchorman and announcers at each event (some of  whom are of course impersonations of well-known announcers and are  hilarious). The voices, supplied by Crystal, Radner and Shearer are  brilliant. Kids today might not recognize the blustering voice of Howard  Cosell, but it's still funny on its own.
Some of the events are  laugh-out-loud funny. The hockey game is a hoot. The swimming and diving  events. The marathon, of course. The absolute best, however, is the boxing  match, with Crystal doing a Cosell-Ali interview that stuck in my mind all  these years as an all-time classic. Just hearing that name, ""Joey  Gongalong"" is enough to get the giggles going.
There are brief  character interviews that are at times a bit bizarre, but they're no  cheesier than the bits you'll see on NBC this summer. And the music, while  very seventies, set a nice nostalgic tone. My only criticism is the part  with the skier going up the mountain & finding ""Dogra-La"",  which was just plain stupid and didn't mesh with the rest of the movie.
But that's a minor quibble in a cartoon that is still a favorite. Great  animation, great voices and writing...if you get the chance, see this  movie.",962150400,8,1567,4.758364312267658

1197991,4,B000009RXS,"When I was a child, I remember my siblings and I discovering an animated movie titled ""Animalympics"" at our local library.  For whatever reason, we fell in love with said film, and would check it out almost every time we visited the library and watch it repeatedly (I'm rather shocked that we didn't wear out the tape, to be honest...).  I'm sure the tape is long-gone by now, but memories of the film remained... and I was rather sad to find that said film has fallen into obscurity and is only available as either an expensive, hard-to-find VHS or an equally hard-to-find German-made DVD.  I was, however, able to re-watch and re-acquaint myself with said special through a torrent of said special found online.

While nostalgia was a huge factor in liking this film -- and a rewatch proves that this film is a lot sillier than I remembered -- it's still an underrated gem, and is long overdue for a re-release.

""Animalympics"" is exactly as the title says -- an Olympic Games in which animals (some anthropomorphic, others not) compete against one another.  While it's treated much like an official Olympics, with various events highlighted and an eclectic assortment of athletes facing off against one another, there are certain athletes who command more of the spotlight and even a few story arcs.  Two rival runners of the marathon, the goat Rene Fromage and the lioness Kit Mambo, run neck-to-neck for much of the race but find themselves growing slowly attracted toward each other; a sewer-dwelling alligator named Bold Jenkins dreams of winning the gold and faces off against the champion who first inspired him; the skiing champion Kurt Wufner (a dog) is lost in the mountains and must find his way back before his event starts; the fencing event becomes a battle of good vs. evil between an evil warthog and the heroic hawk Contessa; and surfer-dude otter Dean Wilson discovers his hobby just might come in handy to win the gold in one of the swimming events.

Unlike the actual Olympic games, the Animalympics combine both summer and winter events, and focus on regions of the world (North America, South America, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Africa, etc.) rather than individual countries.  And unlike the real Olympics, the events are interspersed with musical numbers provided by Graham Gouldman of the band 10cc, as well as surreal moments such as an acid-trip-worthy music video during the diving event and a sudden side-trip to a mountainside Utopia populated entirely by female dogs.

Silliness aside, this really is a fun video, a celebration of the Olympics with a colorful cast of characters and plenty of humorous moments that help offset some of the seriousness of the actual Olympic games.  Amid the scandals and controversies that seem to besiege the modern Olympics, it's just nice to have something to remind us that the games were intended to be fun and a celebration of the spirit of friendly competition.  And if it takes a cast of animals to show us that, then so be it.

The animation in this special isn't Disney quality, but it's serviceable, and the voice work is well-done despite literally being a cast of four people (including Billy Crystal and SNL actress Gilda Radner).  The accents get silly and over-the-top at times, especially Radner's Barbara Walters impersonation, but this helps add to the charm of the special.

I seriously hope this film gets a more widespread DVD release someday.  It may not be a masterpiece, but it's fun and an underrated classic of the early '80s.  If you're a fan of the Olympics,  check this one out (if you're able to find it...).",1455148800,2,3600,4.854575163398692

While I'm waiting, I'll get the VHS and relive every moment going ""Down Into The Water"".

This is a must-have for any family who loves animals and sports. The characters are a riot, and the animation is still as fresh and alive as the day it came out in '79. The messages speak loud enough without being obtrusive, the music is fantastic, and the silliness is nonstop. How can one keep a straight face while watching a figureskating flamingo? Or the 100 meter dash complete with dragstrip sound effects? Then there's the gutwrenching (from laughing too hard!) segment where we see the mental anguish of a marathoner fighting his affections vs his ambitions.

I've read in some sites that this movie was later purchased by a major studio and gutted. I want the original that I have, but on DVD.

1198050,5,B000009RXS,"I can't speak for the quality of the VHS version since I'm waiting for this to come out on DVD, but anyone who enjoys classic cartoons should love this film. Just as for many other people this was a favorite as a child. I think my siblings and I wore out the copy at our local video store from renting it so many times. Anyone who remembers the style of Olympic coverage in the 1970s will recognize the way the story is presented and appreciate what a good spoof it is. The animation, while a bit dated by today's standards, is still quite good and rich in detail. There are some wonderful vocal performances by celebrities (as mentioned in other reviews) doing animal impersonations of famous news personalities of the time such as Howard Cosell and Barbara Walters (kids will just enjoy the accent). Also notable are many wonderful musical numbers. There are plenty of quality pieces in here that should appeal to people of all ages. (My personal favorite is the funky underwater number for the diving competition, starring an otter with a stereotypical california surfer accent.) The humor is fairly broad and not especially subtle but should still be able to hold  adult attention for those who choose to watch with their children. There is some violence, and injury is done to characters in an over-the-top humorous fashion, not to mention some mildly suggestive moments, but I don't think even particularly careful parents should find anything too offensive for children to watch. In fact many of the themes encourage good sportsmanship, goal-oriented effort and avoiding the problems of obsessive behavior. It is very 70's, I think, in it's emphasis on individuality and putting the pursuit of happiness in perspective. All in all, I think this is an excellent animated film which should appeal to both those who are looking for enjoyable family movies and those who collect classics in the animation genre. And for all adult viewers, Rene Fromage may have a great musical number, but the show stealer is still Kit Mambo! Rrowwl!",1127174400,9,2036,4.884393063583815
1198051,5,B000009RXS,"This is one of my favorite movies! I first saw it on HBO, for which only aired it a few times every 4 years. After a heart break in not seeing it air, I re-discover it on the Disney Channel. I then remember temporarily subscribing to Disney Channel to videotape the movie. I was surprised to see it on home video by UAV gold in 1995, since the movie was originaly prodced by Mr. Lisberger in 1979. Anyway, I found that this movie was quite entertaining and inspiring to all who attempt to achieve their life's ambitions and goals. The animal characters were well drawn, and especailly the females were given a more womanly-like figure, which was great and sexy-like. The movie does shine off and reflect the 1970's, which is when love, and sex was a big thing back then. I do get a laugh at the comical outcome from all the events. I admit that famous figure skater Dorthy Tournell did steal my heart away with her great figure skating, but she was very emotional and proud to get the gold.

  My fave was also the Fencing scene. Sure the large warthog of the Count had won the gold medal by cheating and bringing everyone down, but it took the surprise appearance of an avengeful female Hawk named Contessa to teach him a lesson, and she did. I loved her Italian accent and she is good looking as well. You have to laugh when she flips the count with her feet, sending the count to the corner, and has a hard time getting up, while the Contessa teases the count by pointing her foil tip at the count's belly and swirls it, while the count is in shock and attempts to bring up his bulk hoping she will miss, but then ""BUZZZ.""

Made in 1979, but never given a theatrical release, ""Animalympics"" is a rather delightful film set on an island that is inhabited by animals from all over the world whose single interest in life, it seems, is to compete in the Olympic games.
Featuring the voice talents of Billy Crystal and Gilda Radner, the writing and directorial talents of Steven Lisberger (of ""TRON"" fame), plus an awesome soundtrack by 10CC's Graham Gouldman, ""Animalympics"" is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by anyone, no matter how young or old that person may be.

(Here's a quick sidenote about the video quality.  Normally, I would recommend avoiding any video put out by United American Video because their video quality is usually just plain lousy.  However, their ""gold"" edition, clamshell package release of ""Animalympics"" is actually quite good.  Granted the film hasn't been digitally remastered, but it has been copied in the SP mode, instead of the cheap EP mode which UAV, as well as most other smaller video companies, usually copies their videos in.  To sum it all up, the copy I purchased played just fine.)",998352000,14,1570,4.796296296296297

When I found it here at Amazon I jumped at the chance to own it again and was delighted to find that it held the same magic now that it did almost 20 years ago!
Billy Crystal and Gilda Radner are absolutely magnificent with their voice characterizations.  I've always thought the segment with ""Dogri-La"" was a little rediculous and added nothing to the film.
I was totally blown away, however, when I saw on Amazon that this film is rated *R*!  Why the adult rating?  This has to be Amazon's rating, as it is not rated on the case.  I suggest parents use their own discretion, but I see absolutely nothing in this film that suggests a rating less than PG!

7905662,4,B000009RXS,"I have such fond memories of watching Animalympics with friends back in the day that it will always have a special place in my heart. When I found a VHS copy, I never missed a chance to share it with friends, and every line of dialog is tattooed in my memories. Its a bit of a product of its time, poking fun of figures like Muhammed Ali and Howard Cosell, and one character in particular who is supposed to read as Japanese is a gag that hasn't aged well. But its satire of the methods of network Olympic coverage still rings true, and the use of what appear to be early computer-aided graphics make the title sequences really pop.  Animation fans will recognize the names of present-day directors like Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille, etc) and Roger Allers (The Lion King, et al), as well as its two celebrity voice talents, to say nothing of Steven Lisberger, who is best remembered for Tron. Evidence of a prototypical Tron-like design are present in his studio intro, showing a man of pure energy hurling glowing discs.
The last US release of Animalympics was on VHS in the early 1990s, so I was pleased to stumble across this DVD version, and I ordered it sight unseen. Im pleased to say that its an uncensored version, with no bits removed for showing characters smoking or being a touch risqu. But the video quality doesnt seem to be a substantial improvement over the VHS version. It may have been too much to hope that this fairly obscure cartoon would warrant a full restoration, or that a master copy even exists anymore.  But given how prominent the music is in Animalympics, and considering that it was originally recorded in Dolby stereo, and that the full soundtrack was released on album years ago, it would not only have been nice to hear this movie in stereo, its enirely possible.
The menu is a single screen grab of two of the characters, and the extent of DVD features are chapter selection and closed captioning in English. I played through the captioning to see how it holds up and was disappointed to see a lot of basic errors- some jokes fail because a key word was transcribed wrong, and sometimes a characters name will be misspelled, despite often being spelled out in an on-screen graphic.  A little bit more care would have been welcome here.

The short of it: Animalympics is a fun, smart romp with funny characters- its enjoyable to audiences of all ages at a time when most American cartoons were pure baby food.  Im thankful to the distributor, Hens Teeth, for making this available to new fans in a consumable format.  But putting out a mono version robs it of something big.  And the subtitles are weak. I think a better quality version wouldnt be that much harder to produce, which is the only reason it falls short of five stars for me.

Just wanted to make this clear before it comes out: I love this movie. As a cartoon fanboy it features some of the best animators and directors of the 90s and 2000s in a neat early hodge podge of their talent.

BUT, I will come back to this when this DvD comes out. Sh*t hapens. Cartoons drawn in full screen are cut in half for wide screen like certain releases of The Jungle Book or Transformers 1987, sometimes audio is ruined like the Ranken Bass Hobbit post VHS. SOMETIMES the public domain pirates release unwatchable versions of the Fleisher studios Gulliver. SOMETIMES you have missing seasons and missing famous episodes of The Tick from the 90s. And even further still, sometimes you can get golden collections of the complete Tex Avery or Goofy cartoons in france and england for the price of a candy bar, but the american collector's market turns that into $500 bootlegs. (Side note. Region free dvd players are $25. Get one).

Cartoons and film have the bad luck of only existing as copies. There is no stone tablet to hold a film in a pure state. Only the care and love in creating copy after copy can keep this art medium alive.

The animation was by the short-lived Lisberger company which eventually joined with DIsney Studios - they were responsible for the animation sequences in films like ""TRON"" and ""The Black Hole"".
Have you ever seen an elephant on the uneven bars? Or a hippo on a gymnastics horse? What about a swimming race between a sea otter, a squid, a manta ray and a killer whale? These are just a few of the hilarious ideas these brilliant animators and writers came up with.
It would seem that in a year when the Olympics is on everyone's mind, this film should return in some form - even if it's OnDemand. For those who believe that the film may have lost relevance, I can assure you that many of the figures spoofed in this gem are well-remembered or have contemporary parallels. For instance, Mahk Spritz or Dean Wilson (a sea otter) could be parodies of Michael Phelps. People still talk about gymnast Nadia Comenichi who is parodied as a mink named Tatiana Tushenko. There's even a Bruce Lee parody in a Mandarin duck named Bruce Quackimoto. The list goes on. Events include Marathon, Track & Field, Skiing, Swimming, High Dive (100m to be exact), Boxing, Soccer, Basketball, Fencing, Weight Lifting, Gymnastics (floor, horse and uneven bars), Hockey and Volley Ball among others.
We really need to get this film restored (if necessary) and onto DVD/Blu-Ray. If for no other reason it would be a great tribute to many comedy greats, like Gilda Radner, who left us all too soon, and Billy Crystal, who are still with us and making us laugh.",1466985600,3,2287,4.734335839598997
