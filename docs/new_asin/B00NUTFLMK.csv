8680352,5,B00NUTFLMK,How was the maze about learning about air balloon and also of its construction of that particular balloon the theory of air balloons in flight still amazes since that first flight and hasn't changed very much Alex Torres,1475452800,,220,4.815789473684211
8680353,5,B00NUTFLMK,"Another winner from Nova, this is the story of the first balloons -- this was when humans first learned how to get into the sky.  It covers the Montgolfier Brothers, who built several balloons made of paper -- the first ones didn't carry humans, but eventually, when they were deemed safe enough, the Montgolfiers themselves went aloft.  They used hot air balloons, which meant that there had to be a fire onboard to make the craft light enough to rise into the sky.  Jacques Charles used hydrogen instead and he too was successful in getting aloft in that same year of 1783.

This Nova episode not only tells their story but also shows a number of experts and craftspeople as they build balloons similar to the original ones.  It wasn't easy!  The Montgolfiers ran a paper factory and used paper, but there was also the problem of deciding just how they'd built them and also making them a little safer to fly.  But they do manage to do that and actually fly across the English Channel to France, as was done not long after the first balloon flights.  Tom Crouch is one of the passengers and he has long been an expert on ballooning and the history of flight.

The story of the Montgolfiers is fairly well known and can be found online too.  But this is a beautiful way to see the real things in action.

Some of the early balloonists used balloons to learn more about the weather aloft.  One favorite book of mine devotes a chapter to that (""The Atmosphere"", which is part of the Time-Life Planet Earth series -- sadly, out of print but available second hand).  Another one is ""The Aeronauts"" which tells the history of ballooning from the Montgolfiers onward; that too is out of print but available at Amazon second hand.  It's part of the Time-Life Flight series.  Tom Crouch published a book ""The Eagle Aloft"" in 1983 (available 2nd hand) that covers a lot of details in the history of ballooning.  And his newer book, ""Lighter than Air"" is well-illustrated and available at Amazon as well.

This Nova episode is also available on Amazon Instant, in Nova Volume 12. If you like flying and/or balloons, you should enjoy this episode.",1428105600,,2137,4.611111111111111
