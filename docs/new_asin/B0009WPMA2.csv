2329494,4,B0009WPMA2,"The elegant tastefulness, gentleness and unpretentiousness of this film was absolutely refreshing.  Definitely a Buddhist flavor to it!  Makes me shudder to think how badly this movie would have been mangled in the hands of most Western (particularly American) directors like Steven Spielberg, who can't resist shoving some feel-good ""message"" down the viewer's throats and indulging in glib stereotypes or soggy histrionics.

The fight scenes are not nearly as graphic and brutal as they could have been since this is after all Muay Thai, one of the most brutal martial arts in the world.  This could be disappointing or relieving, depending on your tastes.  However they are fairly convincing for a movie---you don't get the ludicrous ""Hollywood Kwon Do"" spinning jump cartwheel-kicks often seen in Van Damme and Chuck Norris films, and the fights do not consist of two guys taking turns suddenly deciding to drop his hands and be a punching bag for the other guy (as is standard for those pathetic ""Rocky"" movies).

The acting is nothing to write home about but nothing to cringe at either---not anywhere as weak as ""Ong Bak: Thai Warrior"" which is another Thai film that features even more spectacular Muay Thai fight choreography.  Likewise, the plot keeps us engaged, and the film often has the audacity to segue into surreal, symbolic passages.  There are a few spots where it appears that the director is trying too hard to make this an oh-so-very hip, stylish MTVish music video with some jump cuts, colored/polarized lens filters such as during the first 5 minutes, but they are not fatal.

I wish they had included some real fight footage of the real-life transvestite kickboxing champion that this movie is based upon, though.  All in all this is definitely worth seeing, it's a unique and fascinating look at a sport that is still underexposed here in the US, and a controversial subject matter (transexuals and transvestites) that the Thais seem to handle far more humanely and intelligently than we do.",1148083200,3,2017,5.03003003003003
2329495,5,B0009WPMA2,"This visually and intellectually stunning debut film by Thai director Ekachai Uekrongtham is also a realistic and captivating portrait of the real life of Thailand's most famous Thai kickboxing champion, Nong Toom.  The depth of presentation and plot of this film obviously required a great deal of thought, planning and coordination, and it is simply a masterpiece.

The story behind Beautiful Boxer occurs within an enchanting and fascinating feature of Thai culture, as well as on Nong Toom's life - the belief in a third sex.  Within this context, Nong Toom knew since he was a boy that he was not male, but female.  Coming from a poor family, he began boxing to support his family, and then to realize his dream of re-assigning his body to match his true gender.  So determined was he to realize this dream, that he trained very hard, and, along with his natural talent, became an extremely successful boxer, winning most of his fights.

The film presents us all this, taking us from Nong Toom's childhood in the gorgeous Thai countryside, as a child Buddhist monk, to a teenager, and then an increasingly formidable boxer.  Along with its presentations of poverty, family responsibility, identity crises, and definitions of gender, Beautiful Boxer delivers punches of great humor that never fall far behind the action in the ring.  Nong Toom's struggle to be accepted for who he really is, is a compelling story to follow, and this story is delivered tastefully, artistically and sensitively, while never letting up on the drama that builds up with exquisite planning and timing.  It is also artistically exquisite, with imaginitive close-up shots and gorgeous vistas; its visuals are always colorful and deep at the same time.

Some of the greatest films portray dichotomies, or the play of what are perceived to be fundamental opposites.  This film melds the aggression of boxing with a gentle femininity that Nong Toom so values, and, beyond that, hints at questions on the meaning of gender.  Just watching it is an intellectual exercise.

This film is so realistic and detailed that one of Nong Toom's most famous fights (against a female Japanese wrestler) was re-enacted for the film, with the same female wrestler who had fought against Nong Toom in real life.

I discovered this film in an absolutely intriguing feature on National Geographic's website about Thailand's ""ladyboys"", or members of the ""third sex"".  For more details, please read the article, ""Thai ""Ladyboy"" Kickboxer Is Gender-Bending Knockout"".

Nong Toom is now an extraordinarily beautiful woman, inside and out.  Visit the film's website for more: [...]",1148083200,2,2638,5.097674418604651

2329498,5,B0009WPMA2,"I was drawn to this movie because of the wonderful reviews and the praise for the star, Asanee Suwan.  My expectations for the film were not only met but surpassed.  This movie is thrillingly photographed---the lush scenery is extraordinary.  And the storytelling is surpassed only by the wonderful acting by all of the performers. But the movie belongs, as it should, to Asanee Suwan.  He is a find!  A wonderful kickboxer and actor and he's stunningly sexy and believable as a man with a woman inside. I hope we see many, many more movies with Asanee in the future.  I wish he were staying with me tonight!",1128211200,14,608,4.635514018691588
2329499,3,B0009WPMA2,"Ekachai Uekrongtha, who has never directed a film, has cast a young athlete who has never acted in a movie about a Thai kickboxer who became a model and actress. ""Beautiful Boxer"" is exactly what you might expect: a well-meaning debut with strong subject matter left unexamined and weak acting, directing and cinematography. It's about the personal and social trauma of changing gender, but it treats its still-living subject so respectfully that we learn nothing about the young man's sexuality or later about the young woman's he has become.

Disappointing, yes, but there are compensations. Asanee Suwan's acting may be weak but he projects a sweet nature and his ring prowess is not to be denied. His gimmick to get noticed, kickboxing as a pretty transvestite, is exploited by promoters to earn celebrity, big matches and money for his sex-change. Surprisingly, his family loves and supports him. Who can resist a twist like that? However, that's as far as the script takes us, skimming the surface of waters that clearly run deep.",1127952000,8,1036,5.023255813953488

It moves incredibly slow at times, but it was not shot in Hollywood, so don't go into this one expecting alot of eye candy. The film is rudimentary at best, but also scathingly open and honest. The fight scenes are good, the build-up to each fight done well...

Beautiful Boxer is definitely worth watching, especially if you like import films or fighting. Half of this movie would be labeled a ""chick flick"" by most Americans...but the drawn out story of the transition is worth watching.",1126569600,6,576,4.818181818181818
2329501,4,B0009WPMA2,"I don't have the inclination to write a thorough review.

After much anticipation of this movie, I have to say the film delivered on the training and fighting of Muay Thai.  There were some silly cinematic effects of Toom's transformation, along with some cliched timings of story events.  The transgender issue many be odd to some, but really, the treatment here was not particularly overt.  They did not show any gay scenes, although some were alluded to in one bath scene.

The acting in general was kinda weak, Toom delivered his role well.

The Muay Thai fights were great, and the training sequences inspiring.  In particular, I loved the cross-discipline fight betwen Toom's Muay Thai and female Japanese wrestling.  One may find such a gender mix odd, but really, Toom is on the feminine side of masculine while the Japanese wrestler is barely recognizable as a woman.

Overall, this is one of the best Muay Thai movies out there.",1124064000,,938,4.849056603773585

The night before my wife watched Shall We Dance with Richard Gere and although I could only stand a few minutes of it I compared the fakey Hollywood emotions of that to this film. WOW...what a difference!, this film generated such a range of genuine feeling both from the truly amazing sensitive first time acting of the lead to the excitement of the excellently coreographed fight scenes. This guy Asanee is just incredible! Only problem is...he is so convincing he may always be thought of as this role if he ever acts again.

2329503,5,B0009WPMA2,"Rising even higher than the greatest expectations engendered by the International Press when it became a favorite of the film festivals, BEAUTIFUL BOXER is one of the more poetic, sensitive, luxuriously vivid and colorful films to come out of Thailand - and that is saying a lot, given the extravagant epics that yearly grow in popularity.  This work of art is simply stunning in content, in direction, in acting, and in heartfelt simplicity of message.  This is a great one!

Writer/director Ekachai Uekrongtham based his first film on the true story of Parinaya Charoemphol AKA Nong Toom, a famous Thai athlete Muay Thai boxer (better known as 'kick boxer' - a demanding, dangerous sport) who entered the world of Muay Thai to garner enough money to help his family and pay for his ultimate sex-change surgery. A tough story to offer general audiences, perhaps, but Ekachai Uekrongtham presents this edgy biography with such cinematic finesse and care that it becomes a film that should appeal to a very wide audience.  And much of that success is due to the towering performance by Asanee Suwan in his acting debut: Suwan is in life a professional kick boxer who won the title role after extensive auditions by many practitioners of Muay Thai.

BEAUTIFUL BOXER takes us through the life of Nong Toom, his childhood in a family of loving accepting parents who respect his love of beauty and things feminine, his brief period of being a monk sho must leave the monastery because of his inclinations, through his introduction to makeup and play-acting women's roles in the Thai theatres, his ridicule as being more girl than boy (a fact that results in his parents' incarceration!), and his devoted friendship with a girl who supports his desire for femininity and a young man who stands up for him in the boys' camp for learning sports. Gradually Nong Toom realizes that the only way he can make enough money to achieve a sex change operation is to become a successful kick boxer and he aligns himself with a trainer Pi Chart (Sorapong Chatree) and with much commitment and practice becomes Thailand's most famous Muay Thai.  His self-respect is further established when he openly wears makeup in the boxing ring, causing many to believe his act is a gimmick and not the manifestation of his true transsexualism.  He fights the toughest opponents and wins consistently until he at last arrives in Toyko for the 'big purse' of fighting female wrestler Kyoko Inoue (who plays herself).  With the money from the fight he is able to have his surgery and becomes the famous actress and model now living in Bangkok.

Under less sensitive eyes and minds this story could have become audacious, but instead the film elects to be sensitive to the transsexual conviction that Nong Toom is a woman trapped in a man's body, and it is the journey of self acceptance and personal victory that makes the story so deeply touching. Asanee Suwan, as a fine athlete, does all of his own fighting in the film and it is more choreography than brutality.  He is amazing to watch and coupled with the fact that he is so wholly convincing in his fine acting that he makes this young transsexual utterly credible in movement, emotional density, and purity of vision is an extraordinary achievement.

Yes, the film has a few flaws of editing and other minor aspects, but the overwhelming power of the story more than compensates for those 'first film' learning curves.  Highly recommended for ALL audiences, especially for those who fear there will be gratuitous physical scenes that might offend.  There are none!

2329539,4,B0009WPMA2,"*** Thai with English subtitles ***

This emotional and often humorous bio on transwoman Parinya Charoenphol focuses on both her childhood and renowned Muay Thai kickboxing career as Nong Toom.  Born into a loving but impoverished family in 1981, Nong shows early signs as a child of identifying as a female.  This greatly concerns Nong's parents due to the hardships they know will lie ahead, but they ultimately love and support their child come what may.

Believing young Nong has done something terrible in a previous life and is now facing a life of hardship as a result...  Nong spends a short period as a Buddhist Monk to deal with this bad karma.  When it's clear Nong will never change, that's the end of monk life. Later, Nong is forced into a fighting match by a bully and discovers there is money to be made in this stuff when she actually wins.  This leads to joining a Muay Thai training camp for boys, which Nong believes will lead her into supporting her poverty-stricken family and eventually financing her sex-reassignment surgery.  In Thailand, kickboxing is considered the top national sport for men.

Nong doesn't initially believe in the violence she feels she is a part of with kickboxing.  And so her struggles with feeling like a sensitive and feminine woman (who is secretly discovering the joys of makeup) while engaged in such a masculine sport is oftentimes pretty funny.  Surprisingly, she always manages to find those who support who she is in the midst of tons of testosterone.  When she is allowed to wear makeup during the fighting matches, the crowd goes wild and her popularity and opportunities soar.  Because she isn't just a novelty... she's a champion.  Or so that is how she is portrayed.  The public does question how much of Nong's career and transsexualism is a lie and simply for entertainment and monetary gain. She is a popular yet controversial figure. Yet her transition into becoming a woman continued.  In 1999, Nong retired as a fighter and underwent her reassignment surgery.

This was a really good story.  It's told as a flashback by a post-op Parinya to one reporter.  Asanee Suwan does a fine job in the leading role and is a trained kickboxer himself. The film quality is better than the average lgbt-themed flicks I'm used to seeing.  But I'd of loved it if the story said a little more about her romantic life- if there was any. Because I guess I just wanted to see her have it all!  :)  Then again, it primarily covers her life as a child and teenager, so it's pretty limited time-wise. There are no sex scenes.  Some male butt shots.

This movie really tried to stay focused on the positive and, overall, it's got a very inspirational feel.  It's a very sensitive and honest story that is both dramatic and amusing. It's also very much a sports film with tons of kickboxing scenes.  Normally this would not appeal to me, but it's so much more than that.  It's a movie with a whole lot of heart and a really amazing journey.

Highly recommended.  Definitely scan youtube for footage of the real Nong Toom/Parinya Charoenphol.  Fascinating.",1405814400,,3100,4.7401869158878505

2329579,5,B0009WPMA2,"This film will surprise you. It is a beautiful film with outstanding acting and a sincerely expressed message about diversity and self acceptance. It would be so easy for a young transgender person who becomes a champion kick boxer to be satirized but this film takes the total high road and we get a wonderful film that feels genuine even if the story line seems like something out of a grocery store tabloid magazine. After seeing the film I can understand why the international film community loved this movie.

The film is based on a true story of a champion kick boxer, Nong Toom, who enters kick boxing almost accidentally and finds that he could make enough money to pay for his sex change operation. But do such circumstances rise our of thin air? Of course not and the film explores the childhood and adolescence of this highly appealing young man who wants to be a woman.

Asanee Suwan plays Nong Toom and his portrayal is exceptional. Suwan is a professional kick boxer which makes all the athletic scenes very authentic, but his acting skills also make all the painful life events touching. A transgender person feels from childhood that they are the opposite sex and this film starts with Nong Toom's childhood and explores how siblings and parents react to a little boy who wishes he was a little girl. Another significant character was Nong Toom's trainer Pi Chart who sees the potential in Nong Toom to become a champion kick boxer.

2329581,4,B0009WPMA2,"I first heard about this person nearly 10 years ago when I was moderating a website for transsexual athletes.  One of the members was an Italian woman who boxed in Italy before she transitioned.  I was fascinated with what she wrote about this Thai kickboxer who had become a champion as she transitioined, and read what I could on the web.  When I heard of this movie some years later, I was very anxious to see it.  It was not a disappointment.

The plot is simple enough, as are most impossibly difficult situations in life.  A young boy in an impoverished rural family wishes for nothing more than to live as a girl.  However, this is not what people in his rural society expect of a little boy.  At a local festival, while awestruck with some traditional dancing that is going on and mostly attended by women, he is entered into a kick boxing tournament that boys at the fair can sign up for, and surprisingly wins his bout.  One thing leads to another and he finds himself in a special school for aspiring kick boxers that is the first rung on a system of schools that feed into the Thai national pastime.  It is not easy for him to fulfill his need to live as a girl and exist, let alone succeed, in a sport strongly tied to a violent male culture.  The movie is about his very public transition as a professional kick boxer and his ultimate fulfillment to live fully as a woman that this career has afforded him.

The movie, though, is about a person's public and private struggle to escape the societal rules and conventions that keep him from truly living as the person she is.  It provides a strong life lesson that the only way to become who you are and succeed at life is to be who you are and not to copy others who are successful.  Each must find her or his own path; it is not another's path that will lead to fulfillment.  It is a beautiful film about struggle and acceptance, despair and ultimate triumph.  This movie is uplifting for all, and the fact that it follows a transsexual kick boxer is only the vehicle for exploring these themes.

The family generally assumes he will ""grow out of"" his early instances of wearing makeup or women's clothing, but his mother seems to sense, early on, that there is more to it than childlike games.  Encouraged by his mother to be able to defend himself, Toom takes up kick-boxing, and soon finds himself winning amateur competitions, one after the other.  His trainer's discovery of Toom's fascination with makeup and cross dressing coincides with a time when he wants to make Toom stand out from other boxers, so he encourages him to wear makeup in the ring.  Toom soon becomes a national favorite, and a hero to transgender people in his country, although most of the population do not realize this is not just a publicity stunt.  As he lives with his coach and other fighters, a situation that offers no privacy, Toom also struggles with taunts that he is demeaning his sport and acting more as a ""clown,"" and becomes increasingly aware of people trying to manipulate him. Following a traumatic event in his life, Toom faces his greatest challenge yet, a high-profile fight with a much larger woman wrestler in Tokyo.

In the title role, Asanee Suwan (who actually has been kick boxing since age 12) is absolutely riveting as the self-assured young girl trapped in a boy's body, nervously straddling the line between masculinity and feminity, while trying to make the most of what she has available to support her family and make her dream come true.  The fight sequences as well as location shots are beautifully photographed, with many special effects that add to the dramatic effect of the story.  A beautiful transgender story, but also contains quite a bit of ""eye candy"" for gay males.  Obviously brings to mind the Oscar winner ""Boys Don't Cry,"" and I'd put this up against that on many levels.  Won numerous film festival awards, a GLAAD award, as well as a ""best actor"" award for Suwan from the Thai movie board.  DVD extras include a ""making of"" featurette, info on the fight sequences, interviews and a music video.  I give this five stars out of five.",1221350400,,2414,4.774038461538462

2329621,4,B0009WPMA2,"A highly watchable film, set in lush locales and featuring several beautiful boxers indeed. The main actor does a formidable job, especially in light of the fact that this is his first feature film. As entertainment, it excels in many ways. By the end, however, it was obvious that only half the story had been told. Based on true events, ""Beautiful Boxer"" is by nature an intensely personal story, and yet, surprisingly, it was also extremely prudish. It traces the protagonist's transformation from male to female, but it says zero about his sex life or romantic attractions. Did he never fall in love or have sex? In this film, these are apparently taboo topics.  Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to intrude into Nong Toom's ""private life."" That would be rather paradoxical, considering the subject matter. The silence surrounding Nong Toom's sexuality might be attributed to idol worship, prudery, or maybe even homophobia. If it's OK to talk about Nong Toom's sex-change operation, why isn't it OK to talk about her love life? And if, in the remote chance that she really was averse to having sex and/or never fell in love with anybody, then that could have been built into the story in an explicit way, because the viewer is bound to be curious about these matters, given the nature of the story. It's weird, but people often fail to acknowledge the obvious when it comes to sex, and this film was no exception in that regard.",1153526400,,1434,4.805668016194332
2329622,5,B0009WPMA2,"This Thai film tells the true story of Parinya Chareonphol, a transvestite kick boxer.  I was fascinated by the exotic setting and the world of kick boxing.  And I was even more fascinated by the fact that this particular young man became famous throughout Thailand by wearing full makeup in the ring as well as consistently winning every fight.

We first meet young Nong Toom as a child.  He finds a lipstick and dresses up to amuse his family.  Later, when the family falls into poverty, he discovers he is good at kick boxing and helps support them.  After schooling in a monastery where he discovers he does not belong, he enrolls in a kick boxing camp where he trains very hard in this form of martial arts.  However, he still likes to put on makeup and does it secretly.  When he is discovered, his instructor tells him to wear it in the boxing ring.  It completely unnerves his opponents.

I found this all fascinating as I had never seen a kick boxing match.  It certainly involves strength and coordination and a willingness to be hurt.  The combatants wear boxing gloves but they also use their bare feet to fight.  It looks like a difficult and precise art that requires discipline and courage to master.  Our hero does just that in spite of many obstacles.

However, our hero lives a tortured life as he really wants to be a woman.  By now the audience understands this wants him to get his dream.

I really enjoyed this film.  It held my interest throughout and although at times it was predictable, I just couldn't stop watching.  I loved the setting and found myself learning more than I ever knew about Thailand and its culture.  The acting was great and so was the cinematography.  And, most of all, I loved stepping into this very different world for a little while and really understanding the character.",1149033600,11,1823,4.599378881987578
