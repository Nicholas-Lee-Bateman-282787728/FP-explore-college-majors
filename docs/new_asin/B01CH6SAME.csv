7683221,1,B01CH6SAME,"Blacks aren't too great, grainy and patchy in parts. Demon looks very outdated. A hair above DVD quality, not that great. :(",1460592000,5,124,4.681818181818182
7683222,5,B01CH6SAME,I know it's early for a review for jeepers creepers on blu ray but shout factory does a good job when they bring out their hits too blu ray. Now if you already have the blu rays well than you know that it's just the film when shout factory gives you the trailers and deleted scenes Plus commataray of now lets just hope we get a good blu ray release of the film because it needs it but part 2 was terrible. So i wouldn't spend my money on another copy of the film when i already have it on blu ray,1457136000,14,497,3.8823529411764706

7683227,5,B01CH6SAME,"If you already have jeepers creepers on blu-Ray AND you are a fan of the film like myself then you must upgrade. The quality of this release by scream factory is sooo much better plus it comes with a whole lot of extras including reversible cover art, a slipcover, new commentaries, deleted scenes, and much more!!!",1466208000,10,315,4.642857142857143

7683231,1,B01CH6SAME,"This is a terrible movie.  Not only is the story garbage, but the entire film has a vibe to it like it was made by someone who is a disgusting person.  It's gross.",1465603200,5,163,3.909090909090909
7683232,3,B01CH6SAME,The movie is good but it is not so scary as the first part. Good for a nice Night.,1464566400,3,82,3.3684210526315788
8753062,5,B01CH6SAME,"I can understand the 1 and 2 star reviews, but only from the perspective that you watched this movie to see how good the acting was or if the story was believable. But this is what a non-horror movie fan does when they watch a Horror film. On the other hand, I am a Horror film fan and this movie was killer in my opinion. But I highly recommend that you watch all 3 films - in this order, JC1, JC3 and then JC2.  JC3 is set between 1 and 2. Once you have seen all 3 (a few times recommended) you will understand the entire story that Victor Salvo tried to tell that hopefully leads to at least one final film set 23 years in the future with Taggert & son Jackie, Trish, Tubbs and any other survivor ready to take on the Creeper in a big showdown. Granted Tubbs and Taggert will have seen better days by that time but seeing the posture of Taggert at the end of JC2, I think he's ready to pull a Captain Nemo.",1522713600,,909,4.0220994475138125
