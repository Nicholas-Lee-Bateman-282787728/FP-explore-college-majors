8149791,2,B000J6H1BQ,It would not play on my Sony Blu ray player.  I could only play it on my computer at work.  The quality was not what I expected.  I am sure there was allot of information in the DVDs but I found myself constantly being distracted by other things and not what he was talking about.  I couldn't get through the first DVD let alone all five.,1375401600,,338,4.075757575757576

8149793,5,B000J6H1BQ,"I have previously purchased this set, watched them, and loved it. They are packed full of info, but definitely variants of your normal Wiccan books/videos. I lent them to a friend last year to watch, and I was never able to get them back. So, I purchased them AGAIN, and I am still just as happy with them. I recommend the set for anyone interested in practical magic.",1303862400,6,368,4.426470588235294
