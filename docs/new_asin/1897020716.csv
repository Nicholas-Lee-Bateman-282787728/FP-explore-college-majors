7801153,2,1897020716,Ordinarily we love John Branyan material.  Unfortunately this just was not very funny.,1469923200,,86,5.615384615384615
7801154,1,1897020716,"It is unfortunate that a man who has claimed to be a Christian and a ""clean"" comic has said the following

""Dont worry about my audiences. Theyre not too bright! "" [...]",1462665600,,169,4.28125
7801155,4,1897020716,"We saw John in person at our church and thought he was very good.  This video isn't exactly what
we expected based on what we saw in person but still a good video.  I think the video is a bit older
and we just saw him a couple months ago.  Some of the jokes were the same but he definitely had a better
delivery when we saw him in person.  Worth what we payed but probably not going to be one of those videos
we pull out when company comes over...still go for the Tim Hawkins every time ;-)",1350864000,,490,3.919191919191919
7801156,5,1897020716,"Good clean hillarious comedy at its finest.  When Branyan starts in with ""his wife's voice"" it cracks me up.  His physical movements around the stage and his various facial expressions are all top notch.  He understands the differences between men and women and manages to make the whole topic absolutely hillarious.",1334880000,,316,5.1568627450980395
