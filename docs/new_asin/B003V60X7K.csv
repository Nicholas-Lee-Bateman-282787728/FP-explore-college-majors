8406443,3,B003V60X7K,"Leigh Ann Orsi Pole Dance Advanced is very lax and graceful. The whole time I was watching this DVD I felt like I was in her BeSpun studio getting personal lessons. That is the one thing I liked most about this DVD. Another thing I enjoyed was the 3 minute free dance. In that section, she gave some good tips about movement and the hips. In the actual trick combo segment she has Amy or Alethea demonstrate the moves while she is explaining what they are doing. One thing I did not like was how they do close ups on the actual body part at times instead of seeing the full body or full trick... I did not understand that at all. Another thing, with some of the moves I wish she had a more in depth explanation or demonstration. This is an ok DVD. Quality is ok. I love Leigh Ann Orsi and her style of pole dancing, she seems to do it so effortlessly... However, I think this could've been done better... I ordered her Beginner DVD and hated it but decided to give her another try because I love her free dance videos on youtube. Also the moves she was instructing were not very advanced to me... Probably intermediate. I am still happy to add this to my DVD pole collection.. I will definitely probably have this playing on mute while listening to music and being on the pole myself to motivate me? or something... or atleast to pretend I am in the studio with them... lol.",1340841600,,1374,4.288461538461538
8406444,5,B003V60X7K,I love this DVD. It has a great warm up. It provides you with many different transitions so you know what to do between tricks. All the combos are pretty difficult. They all have inverts and she breaks them down for you and makes them much easier. I learned a lot from her DVD. It is one of my favorites!,1329609600,,304,4.083333333333333
8406445,1,B003V60X7K,"I found this dvd a little too easy, and somewhat boring. It does not have enough workout. I could have seen the exact step-by -step tricks on youtube. I will probably give it to one of my beginner friends.",1313452800,3,205,4.282051282051282
8406446,5,B003V60X7K,"I just purchased this DVD along with two others (Sedusa Studios and Insomniac Pictures, both also advanced Videos), and Leigh Ann's is by far the best.  I am not quite ready for all of the moves on here but can't wait to get to this level.  She does five different combinations, breaking each one down several times.  All include inverts - very advanced.  Much much better than the two others I bought.",1301011200,2,402,4.541666666666667
8406447,5,B003V60X7K,"I have not opened this yet, i just received it, i am not up to this level but i love her DVDs so much i decided to just get it now so i won't have to wait later:)

fun, challenging, and super sexy.

LOVE THIS SERIES!",1295395200,2,216,3.6739130434782608
