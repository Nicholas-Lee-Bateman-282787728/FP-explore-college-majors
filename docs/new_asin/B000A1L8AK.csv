My title is a quote from the movie! As ridiculous as some of it is, it's actual not a bad film. I enjoyed this old clunker and I never heard of it before now. This should be available in the U.S for all to enjoy. Help are children are in danger! HOOO BOY!",1205971200,,431,4.023255813953488

Filmed in Kansas City MO with the  help of their own police department.
Filmed for more of a public service announcement to get the attention of the public.",1436918400,,253,4.883720930232558

8072337,5,B000A1L8AK,"I recently saw ""The Delinquents""(1957) Instantly on Netflix streaming and I liked it I like alot of the Original So-called ""Social Issues""(saving the whales and the world is not an Social Issue,Morality is.)Films about LittleChumps who run havoc not much has changed,Just because the Film is from 1957 does not mean we don't have the same(Worst)now. The Acting is there,the plot is good and Lessons learned(Better Parenting starts at home)is one of the reasons the Film should be seen,Nothing Funny about it.",1367193600,3,508,5.2073170731707314
8072338,2,B000A1L8AK,"The only interest of ""The delinquents"" is in film history. This the first movie ever directed by the great Robert Altman (Mash, The player, Short cuts) in 1957. It's a low budget ""Z movie"" with little directorial value. Recommended only for movie fans and collectors.",1339027200,2,267,4.955555555555556
8072339,3,B000A1L8AK,"The Delinquents, 1956 film

This movie begins at a club where a singer and band entertain adult customers. Some young men sit by the bar, and are refused service (too young). They break a window after leaving. The announcer says this movie shows the bad effects from a lack of proper moral conduct. At home Scotty is advised against bad friends. He will go to the drive-in with his girl Janice. But Janice's parents won't let her go steady because she is too young. Her parents didn't do this. We see that gang of teenagers up to mischief at a drive-in. There is vandalism from a psychologically disturbed youth. The victims blame the wrong man and there is a fight. The gang sees an empty house. Bill is a manipulator. Scotty's little sister carries a message to Janice so they can meet and make a plan. Bill talks to Janice's parents about himself (quite an act).

Bill invites Scotty and Janice to their party at that empty house. Janice doesn't like Bill (""it doesn't sound right""). They arrive at the empty house. They are given alcohol. Janice runs out, she is angry with Scotty. Later the Kansas City police arrive and call for reinforcements. The gang at the house is arrested and taken in. Eddie concocts a story for Steve to tell (like Iago?). The boys now have it in for Scotty. But would he go to the cops with liquor on his breath? Bill gives a lot of whiskey to Scotty. ""What will we do with him?"" They stop at a gas station. Will Eddie steal money? Will Bill assault the attendant? [These are adult crimes.] Bill's gang discuss their problem. Bill has a plan, and calls Janice. ""Where's Scotty?"" Eddie visits Scotty's house and tells where Janice is. Scotty's parents call the police. Scotty finds Janice and tries to take her away. Bill's two friends just watch. The police take them all to the police station.

The announcer comes in to argue against delinquent teenagers. As if talking would correct a problem with society! The problem of ""juvenile delinquency"" was the unintended consequence of post-war prosperity and nuclear families. No relatives to watch over the home, as in older days, while mothers worked. Teenagers no longer worked after school because of a shortage of small businesses who hired them. Teenagers were also influenced by advertising on TV which created ""peer pressure"". That afternoon TV show from 1957 with Dick Clark really attracted attention! The value of this movie is the attitudes of the people from that era. It is another warning to be careful about the people you associate with, particularly if your parents don't know them. This is a good story even if it is a very low budget movie. Young people need to be warned about those who are bad examples, but some can only learn the hard way. [I suspect there was no outbreak of delinquency among the Amish.] I wonder what these actors will do in the future?",1317254400,3,2858,4.666666666666667
8072340,5,B000A1L8AK,"Why this is not released in the USA on DVD is beyond me,it's a cult classic starring Tom ""Billy Jack"" Laughlin and directed by the legendary late Robert Altman,hopefully it will eventually be released. We'll have to wait and see!!!",1240444800,,231,4.8
