5990608,5,B00FFSTP1W,This is one of the best series of all time. Andy Whitfield was amazing in the first season. Liam Mcintyre came in after Whitfields death and did a great job. Not sure why they ended the series so soon.,1387756800,5,201,4.17948717948718
5990609,5,B00FFSTP1W,"Oh Sparty, I already miss you and it hasn't even been a year. This was a great show. It wasn't the best written or most realistic, it was just the most entertaining. There are men, There are great men, and there was Andy Whitfield. Liam McIntyre did a pretty good job in seasons 3 and 4, but when you're replacing a legend, what in the world are you to do?

I have debated the realitisticness of this show with some of my friends (shoutout Langers 2003). Spoiler Alert- in the first season finale, AWhit jumps 20 feet straight up into the air. So, I'm not sure why they didn't let him take the weights off and really show off his high jump prowess. That being said, I was surprised how close to the history the plot line managed to keep while still being about blood, sex, and more sex. Gotta give them credit for that. Philyodaddy majored in history, so I would know.

In all seriousness, I loved this show as much as I mourned Andy Whitfield's unfortunate passing. Even season 2 without the title character was excellent. Seasons 3 and 4 were a little worse, but oh well, what are you going to do? Godfather 3 wasn't as good as 1 or 2 either. Bring It On 2 (Bring it on Again) wasn't even good at all. So I heard. The Notebook 2 doesn't even exist.

Oh and every female lead gets naked, so that's a good thing right? Mrs. Philyodaddy agrees in absentia.

Sidenote- This was briefly on sale for $64.99, so I would not pay the current price of $105",1387756800,4,1448,4.293040293040293
5990610,5,B00FFSTP1W,"I gave it 5 stars simply because it was enjoyable to watch!  It's not about the price you pay for it, whether it is on DVD, Blu-Ray, or even a rental... just watch it.  What I enjoyed about it is the story line. The next story builds from the last one and it's interesting to watch and think of this Series like any other day time soap opera. With everything including Intrigue, betrayal, lust, sex, power and one man's vision to change the future for a group of people.  It's almost like a cross between the series Dallas and Mad Max Beyond ThunderSex.  I meant Dome...There's really nothing much to ""Dislike"" about it, unless you are not into blood, gore, killing, savagery and abuse by the Roman Empire

Who I would recommend this product to?  Only people who enjoy a good fight scene, the slow-mo action with the teeth flying out and blood squirting like it came from a water fountain is awesome.  Don't get me wrong.... if someone actually took that much hit from the sword, a head-butt to the head with a helmet, and a severe trashing that would actually cause massive internal bleeding, but yet the gladiators come back the next time around like they just came out of the Matrix is simply too incredible to believe.  But out of the 1000+ fight scenes (yes I exaggerate) maybe only about 2 were kind of lame.  I would NOT recommend you watching this around your kids or anyone who gets  squeamish around the sight of a small amount of blood...each fight scene has enough blood in it to make a nice Thriller Video and Dracula a Happy Camper.  And I won't mention the ""Naked"" scenes...  but it does have a factor and ties into the ""Power Concept"" in the series.

That's about it.  No use posting any videos about it. Just watch it.  If you like fighting movies, with the hopes of the underdog winning, schemes upon schemes, surprise endings, and unbelievable come backs.  This is it...  Forget what you've heard others say that the 1st Spartacus actor was better than the 2nd one, forget what others tell you that it's too much to pay for (that's why there's rentals), and forget what others have said that there's better movies out there...just watch it.

And if you want to get a good laugh... Go back to work come Monday morning and yell at the top of your lungs...  I AM SPARTACUS!!!!!!!",1387670400,20,2295,4.513317191283293
5990611,5,B00FFSTP1W,"This series is very well written.  Excellent storyline, excellent acting.  This is one of my favorite series, I can watch over and over.  You have to at least get through 2-3 episodes for it to really get going, but after that, you will be hooked!!!",1387670400,4,249,4.488888888888889
5990612,5,B00FFSTP1W,"I've only seen the first two seasons of this series, however I know others that have seen all of it and I feel compelled to write a review to counter the one start review it received because some cheapskate didn't like the high price tag.

Amazon should not allow reviews based on the price of the product. They also should not allow reviews based on shipping methods of a product. Many items purchased through Amazon are sometimes sold and shipped through multiple merchants and basing a negative review on the your shipping experience for an awesome product throws off what people are looking for, and that's a review of the PRODUCT itself.",1387670400,10,642,4.732142857142857
5990613,5,B00FFSTP1W,"And amazing and extremely realistic snapshot of ancient Rome its gladiators and those who owned and used them.  Extremely graphic with complete nudity (male/female) as we would really expect, if we could travel in time. I believe that this series must be one of the best for it's very realistic portrayal of our characters, ongoing plot and many subplots. Excellent acting by absolutely everybody, major and minor roles... Physical beauty, excellent CTI representation and many extremely brutal moments which were essential to our storyline and should not be construed as gratuitous. I think most would agree this is a very accurate depiction of Rome and it's many aspects of the era. I saw one season and new the rest had to be at least as good And, I was definitely not disappointed!
Without hesitation, I strongly recommend the entire series (all four seasons) and the valuable entertainment which Will be encountered and this most worthy investment.  Don't hesitate Order it as soon as you can. Enjoy!",1435708800,,1005,5.048192771084337

5990615,3,B00FFSTP1W,My friend liked it.  I paid for it.  Too bloody for me!,1426032000,,55,3.5
5990616,3,B00FFSTP1W,Season 1 was unplayable.  Haven't had a chance to view beyond 3.  Disappointed that they are now available on Netflix.,1423094400,,118,4.85
5990617,5,B00FFSTP1W,"When I first started watching Spartacus it was a guilty pleasure; I was afraid to admit that I liked it. It seemed to be little more than a vehicle for violence and nudity (copious amounts of both!), but after about 4 episodes I was forced to admit that it was good. And not good in that it was fun to watch, but actually good. You have to get used to the dialog and stylized violence, but once you do it's a great series. It gets to the point where the violence and nudity barely registers, but to the show's credit it never really slacks off. Don't you hate some series that start out with some very sexy actresses who never take their clothes off again after the third episode? Yeah, that doesn't happen here.

Characters are well-developed, complex and flawed, and you find yourself both liking and hating almost every character at some point. You recognize the obvious villains and hate them in their dealings with the heroes but cheer for them when they deal with their own villains.

The first season is the strongest in terms of plot and story arcs, and it's not an exaggeration to say that I could barely sit still during the last three episodes. The prequel season is an excellent filler that really develops a lot of characters from the first season. A lot of backstory is developed and I still find it hard to believe that it was written after the first season. I accepted the switch to Liam McIntyre in the title role for season 3, though I'll always wonder how great Andy Whitfield would have been (stupid cancer). The fourth season introduced a new antagonist in Crassus, but I hesitate to call him a villain because he's not a bad guy; I was rooting for him as much as I was rooting for the slave rebellion.

This is a highly recommended series, though it is definitely not appropriate for young viewers and those who don't like to see the human body (both inside and out).",1421280000,,1889,4.4854651162790695

5990636,1,B00FFSTP1W,Awesome series loved it. But if you buy them all separately its cheaper. I would understand if there were in a special box or something extra you got by buying the complete series. But there isn't. You save about $10 by buying them seperate. Not much but hey if yoir like me and can save $ I take it.,1395446400,,300,4.101694915254237
5990637,4,B00FFSTP1W,I did like the series a lot but I had an issue with First season's Blu Ray. As I did replace that but that issue is still there.

5990638,5,B00FFSTP1W,"What can I say? It's Spartacus! This is another show I tried my best to ignore, but it is definitely a good show! Warning: A lot of blood and gore and sexual scenes are in this series, so definitely not something I'd watch with my step kids unless they were older and I didn't have to answer the slew of questions that would come after watching just one episode.

5990641,5,B00FFSTP1W,"Brutal.  I've never seen anything quite like this. Really enjoy the plot line, and how the characters build.  There are very few redeeming characters in this show.  Many times you find yourself rooting for one of the players to get killed.  Sometimes the graphic sex gets a little overboard, at least for me, but in certain amounts is important in setting the mood of the times.  One note, I started the series with the six episode Gods of the Arena.  I'm glad I did, as it is a prequel to the rest of it.  Although not crucial to do that, it tends to give the entire four seasons a little better flow, especially with the evolution of the house of Batiatus, and later with Gannicus and Ashir.  This is a great one of a kind show, definitely not for kids, or anyone without a strong stomach.  I lucked out and got all four on an Amazon special for $54.00.  As a suggestion, I would recommend watching the two seasons of Rome as well.",1392076800,,933,4.341040462427745

5990654,5,B00FFSTP1W,"The story line, action and use of cgi were well done.  The loss of actor Andy Whitfield after the first season was tragic but the continued story line carried the series.

5990674,1,B00FFSTP1W,"So to counter what other people are saying, I feel price is very much a factor when reviewing this particular version of the Blu-rays. I'm no cheapskate, and I loved the series, but each season is less than $30. I've never even seen it in retail stores for more than $40, and even at that price you still come nowhere near the price of this package, which so far as I can tell offers no compelling extras. Not bashing the series, but you'll be better served picking up each season individually and saving over $100. Just sayin'.",1388620800,25,528,4.453608247422681

5990676,4,B00FFSTP1W,"The show does get 4.5/5 stars from me. It's one of the best original shows to come along.

What I found weird was how I got this package. The first two seasons (Gods of the Arena and Blood & Sand) were in standard multi-DVD packaging. But then Vengeance and War of the Damned were in this slipcover packaging with a 'book-type' casing, where each disk was kept in a cardboard page-sleeve and opened like a book, set within a hardcover. I love consistency myself. However, all of them were shrink wrapped and bound with an official binding on the outside.

I wasn't sure if there were book-type casings for Gods of the Arena or Blood & Sand; I wish there were and they were included in the set, but for the price I got the whole series for during its sale, I cannot argue. Having the whole series for my own is definitely something.

If you do find the individual DVD sets on sale in the future, jump on them. If this ever goes on sale again, jump on it.",1388448000,,953,4.283333333333333

This is top notch acting and action.

5990678,5,B00FFSTP1W,"Spartacus is a great series that tells the story of a man who was betrayed by the Romans, forced into slavery and then reborn as a Gladiator.  The show is very well acted and storylines kept me interested the whole way through.  If you are unfamilair with the series here is a summary of the series season by season.

Season 1 (Spartacus: Blood and Sand) is the title of the first season of Spartacus.  The series was inspired by the historical figure of Spartacus (played by Andy Whitfield), a Thracian gladiator who from 73 to 71 BC led a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic. This season focuses on structuring the events of Spartacus' obscure early life leading up to the beginning of historical records.

Season 2 (Spartacus: Gods of the Arena) is the prequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand.  The season follows the character Gannicus (Dustin Clare), the first gladiator representing Lentulus Batiatus to become Champion of Capua.  The big storyline from this season is the bloody history of the House of Batiatus and the city of Capua before the arrival of Spartacus.

Season 3 (Spartacus: Vengeance) is the second or third season depending on how you score them of Spartacus.  This season follows Spartacus: Blood and Sand storyline.  Spartacus (played by Liam McIntyre, who replaces the late Andy Whitfield), after he and his fellow gladiators kill their master Batiatus and escape from his ludus, or gladiatorial training school.

Season 4 (Spartacus: War of the Damned) is the title of the third and final season of Spartacus.  This season takes place following the defeat of Roman commander Gaius Claudius Glaber.  Spartacus and his men have amassed major victories against the Romans after the Battle of Vesuvius. These victories have not only forged the legend of Spartacus, but have greatly increased the ranks of the rebellion slaves to more than 30,000.  Rome is indeed beginning to tremble at the threat Spartacus now represents.

I enjoyed this series and would definitely recommend it for you to watch.

Thank you for reading my review.",1387843200,15,2064,4.973760932944606

As for the series itself I found it enjoyable and easy to get into, (especially if you start with Gods of the Arena first instead of season one).  There are some truths from what history is known about Spartacus and of everyday life as a Roman but most is of the producer's vision.  As someone who loves historical accuracy I can still enjoy the show with the great use of so much focus on detail in the costumes and staging of the scenes.  It does have lots of the CGI skies and effects like in 300 which I don't partially care for.  The music is nice and fits with every scene.  This series might not be everyone's cup of tea but if it is this package is a great deal and nice to have to watch whenever one desires.",1477267200,,821,4.230769230769231
