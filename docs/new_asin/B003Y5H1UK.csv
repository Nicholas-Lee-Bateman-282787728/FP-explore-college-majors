8730168,1,B003Y5H1UK,This DVD is impossible to watch & listen to.  It looks like a VHS recording of someone using a computer without a tripod. The speakers English is very poor making it difficult to follow and learn the Bengali.  The poor quality is very distracting making it impossible to get through any section at all.  I am very disappointed that I wasted my money and suggest you look elsewhere for a tutorial.,1316995200,,396,4.549295774647887
