It's set by the beach, beautiful production as always from Gaiam, great light music and Suzanne's voice is calm & her points to watch for cheating or ""to move the right hip back & left forward"", or ""don't compress the neck, keep it open... breathe into the hip..."" came in handy. I normally don't like her style, but this one I did.
Yes, she moves pretty fast, almost power yoga speed, but it's good for people who's balance still isn't that good or when you want to move fast.
This is NOT vinyasa style, but it's isn't totally do one pose, ""ok, let's see, ok, do this one now, gym stiff"" style either.

There are many poses (not in this order): butterfly, child's, lunges, crescent, doward dog, upward dog, mountain, hip openers, seated spinal twists, lying down spinal twists, half moon, warrior 1, 2 & 3, standing fwd bends, triangle, revolved triangle, side angle, boat, bow, pigeon, sitting fwd bends both legs & single, seated wide legged fwd bends, standing wide legged fwd bends, dancer's pose, knee to chest lying down & standing, tree, eagle, side plank, plank, standing split, standing on 1 leg, the other foot in your hand at waist height & then out to the side & several other poses.

This is for a quick moving, many posed workout to stretch almost everything.",1190246400,,1399,4.569721115537849
7920528,4,B00004LMDY,"As a newcomer to yoga, I have used several yoga tapes but always come back to the ones by Suzanne Deason. Her strategy is simple and direct, letting you become familiar with the poses at your own pace. She is so unbelievably flexible and strong that just looking at her body is a motivation in itself! The tape moves quickly, but that did not bother me. The moves are complex and challenging enough that you don't need to hold them all day to reap the benefits. I found myself sweating and I have been doing aerobics for years. This is a great tape and Suzanne Deason's simple, un-trendy approach to yoga is refreshing.",982800000,2,619,4.486725663716814
7920529,2,B00004LMDY,I was greatly looking forward to this video because I need to practice my balance postures. I agree with the previous reviewer. The balance postures are too short in duration either to move on in developing balance or if you are slow to get into them. The thing about balance postures is you can always come out early. This is a good novice tape. If you are looking to develop beyond that this tape won't meet your needs.,981158400,2,421,4.410256410256411
