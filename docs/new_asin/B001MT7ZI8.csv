3699664,4,B001MT7ZI8,"The fourth (and lets hope not final) of the planned straight to DVD Futurama movies, ""Futurama: Into The Wild Green Yonder"" has arrived and continues the winning formula of the television series and three previous films as well as ties things up nicely should this be the final outing for the Planet Express crew.
The film opens with a new take on the traditional opening and we are treated to the scenic Mars Vegas complete with futuristic interpretations of the class Las Vegas hotels. As the film opens, Mars Vegas is being destroyed to make way for a new and even better Mars Vegas. This does not sit well with Amy (Lauren Tom) as her father is the one behind all of this, and when she learns that he plans to eliminate portions of a solar system to make the universes biggest miniature golf course, she decides to join a militant feminist group with Leela (Katey Sagal).
  As this is happening Fry (Billy West), learns that he has the power to read minds and is recruited by a secret organization who inform him of a great evil that is loose in the galaxy and that he will be the key to preserving the universe.
Bender (John Di Maggio), as usual is happy to drink and griftt his way through life, that is until a affair with a local crime figures wife provides him with some danger and distraction.
When a planned protest goes horribly wrong, Leela and Amy end up as fugitives and are doggedly pursued by Captain Zapp Brannigan as they race against the clock to save the creatures of the solar system from Leo Wong's planned construction.
The film is as usual, loaded with laughs and plenty of pop culture gags.  Snoop Dogg and Penn Jilette make cameo appearances as do many of the characters from the series.
With sharp picture and sound, this is a very enjoyable new adventure for fans and should add demand for future adventures in the series and provide great viewing enjoyment.
There are loads of extras which include deleted scenes, commentaries, as well as deleted scenes.

3699666,4,B001MT7ZI8,"I laughed at this one.  Out loud.  The plot meanders a bit, but it's really four episodes loosely strung together, so I that's to be expected.  I recommend it!",1234483200,4,159,4.413793103448276
3699667,5,B001MT7ZI8,This movie was just as good as Bender's Big Score. I thought it was really funny and a had a great plot. It was a great way to wrap up the series.  I'm sure true fan will have nothing but great things to say about it.,1234310400,3,217,3.717391304347826
3699668,2,B001MT7ZI8,"Well, it's finally over - the four movie Futurama direct-to-video series ends with Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder, and it maintains the trend of the films: it's the worst of the four, making Bender's Big Score look like Blade Runner in comparison.

How did such a classic TV series struggle in the home video space? The chief problem is format - Futurama worked as a half-hour series, but when stretched to 90 minutes, it just suffered. The first film managed to pack a coherent storyline, but some of the humor was sacrificed for fan service (starting with the entire lame sequence of ""Box Network"" jokes and the hokey opening credits.)

The subsequent sequels, though, didn't fare as well. They began to struggle to fill 90 minutes, and entire pointless 20 minute TV episode sequences would be introduced and go nowhere, with only a thread of the plot making them relevent to the story.

Into the Wild Green Yonder is the worst offender. Bender's affair with a mob boss' moll is introduced and forgotten, having zero to do with the plot, for instance. What was the point of it save having Bender compete in a poker tournament with Fry, who has become psychic from a freak accident? None. The poker tournament itself also forgotten about roughly 5 seconds after it is over.

The most serious problem, though, is what Woody Allen's character complained about in Manhattan: ""It's worse than not insightful. It's not funny.""

Forgetting the fact that the film is disjointed and scatterbrained like a six year old ADD sufferer on acid - it just isn't funny. Some jokes are telegraphed and predictable, while others aren't funny in the first place (especially the eco-feminists, who are a shrill parody of a parody.) Some blatant fan-service jokes will be lost on non-Futurama fans, while boring to Futurama fans because they'd seen the same humor in many of the episodes.

I don't want to believe that the series was canceled at the right time - I'd rather think that the problems with the films are the fact they had to expand a 23 minute-per-episode format to 90, that they had too long to think about a script (while during the series, they had to push out scripts for 22 episodes fairly quickly), and that they only had to please already established Futurama fans rather than attract new ones since they didn't expect non-Futurama fans to buy the DVDs. One wonders what might have been produced had instead of trying to produce four films, they just produced four new episodes per disc, creating a direct-to-video season instead.

Despite the badness of the script, the film does send the crew off in style, in one of the appropriate places for fan service, wrapping up one or two ongoing stories, and bidding farewell to the crew in a truly poignant moment while leaving the door a crack open for a possible return.

As much as it pains me to say this - I hope they stay away. The closure to the series in the last few minutes is perfect, and I'd rather accept that than another dismal effort that further stains my enthusiasm for the license. Now I know what a Star Wars fan felt after the second trilogy.

3699674,3,B001MT7ZI8,"While Into The Wild Green Yonder, while it has its moments, is not one of the better Futurama episodes. It covers Amy Wong's dad Leo's indiscriminate environmental destruction for the sake of real estate development, and his corrupt plan to bulldoze a dwarf star to build a galactic mini-golf range. Fry develops mental powers (lame plot development), Leela becomes an eco-terrorist (better), and - in one of the funnier plot twists - Farnsworth joins Bender as the anti-hero of the story.

There are some pretty funny scenes of future casino gambling in Mars Vegas, and Penn and Teller drop in to provide commentary as heads in jars, the typical device to get cameos of current stars into the 31st century (Snoop Dogg also drops in as a judge, alongside a silent Paula Abdul and Bjrk). Zapp Brannigan gets tons of great lines, which kept me happy, and there are barely any robots in this besides Bender and the Donbot, which makes me happy too.

Interestingly, the spirited extras are almost as good as the film itself, perhaps even better! There is a long storyboard sequence (22:15) for people who like that sort of thing, and a ""Behind the Scenes"" (5:05) segment described as a ""docudrama - how we make Futurama so good"". The gag here is that Lauren Tom does everything - all the writing, all the voices, and all the animating. Watch Lauren Tom eat a gigantic submarine sandwich! Watch Lauren Tom fake all the ""voices"" (Fry, Bender, Farnsworth, Amy) into an old school cassette recorder. Watch her make toilet paper animation sketches! Watch her make sound effects of baseball bats hitting skin by taking a bat to David X Cohen, and make fake DVD pressings with hamster droppings and last year's ground-up unsold Futurama DVDs. ""I laughed a bit and I learned even less."" ""Penn Gillette mania"" (2:07) ""Louder, louder - the acting technique of Penn Jillette"" is not interesting at all, a waste of time similar to the David Cross featurette on The Beast With A Billion Backs. ""Cutting Room Floor. Golden stinkers - a treasury of deleted scenes"", including ""Dolomite Hill"" (0:25), with the Hard Rock Cafe Mars gag in it, ""Mateluck"" (0:30), with boring Zapp court lines, ""Paint!?"" (0:22) is little more than what's shown in the movie (as many of these ""deleted scenes"" are), ""Morto Solo"" (0:33) is pretty funny, as our bulbous news reader breaks down in tears, Morto misses Linda!! ""Mind Reading"" (0:38) offers some hilarious new lines to the audience mind reading exercise from the end of the film. Mom: ""I think I'll buy Bill Gates' scrotum and have it turned into a coin purse."" Mrs Wong: ""That weirdo Fry is staring at me like he wants me - and who can blame him?"" ""Matt and David in Space"" (5:20), shows the pair with one of Matt's sons on the Zero Gravity plane experiencing 0.66 G (same as Mars), 0.33 G (same as the moon), and then zero Gs. Amusing. Then there's the tutorial ""How to Draw Futurama in 10 very difficult steps"" (11:05), where we see animators draw Farnsworth, Nibbler, the Hypnotoad and Fry, learning useless facts such as that Farnsworth's slippers are two sizes to small, so he ""overshoots"" them in the back, he has three wrinkles on his neck, and that all characters on Futurama have thick upper lips. There's a featurette on 3-D models that's pretty cool, and it shows the green asteroid, with its irregular shape, the Feministas eco-van (which is just a VW bus that flies), the giant gorilla mini-putt, the cut-in-half Nimbus that shows 20 decks of the interior, with 3-D people spewing out of it, plus the wormhole from the end (which we never see in proper 3-D, but it looks pretty cool!). ""Bender in the theatre"" (1:13) has ironic film etiquette, with Bender doing everything that the audience is asked not to do (turn devices to mute/silent mode, refrain from kicking chairs in front, etc). It's an ad for the DVDs. ""Zapp's Love Guide"" (2:45) recycles scenes from recent Futurama episodes of Zapp making love at women, also an ad for the DVDs. ""Women love a man in uniform and that man is me."" Then there's also an unlabelled secret bonus item that's actually the toilet paper animation of Bender drinking a beer.

The other movies mostly left me cold, though, and I've been unimpressed by the new episodes on Comedy Central.  At best, they've been forgettable, and at worst, they've felt like fan fiction -- stringing together references to funny things from the original seasons in place of new jokes, with plots that have little or no organic connection to the characters as established by the series.  This movie feels almost like a return to form, with an engaging story, a more or less steady rhythm of new gags, and all its references to previous installments feeling justified by the context rather than a lack of ideas.

The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star show for me is that the feature length format leads to a lower density of laughs and general enjoyment than with the more natural fit of the half-hour episode.  It's the same problem I had with the Simpsons movie, which I enjoyed about as much as this.  All in all, this is a definite watch if you're a fan of Futurama, although I'd steer newbies towards the original seasons first.",1315872000,,1159,4.521531100478469

There is just nothing in this film that is worth mentioning. I would love to go into a lengthy detailed dissertation on why this movie was so bad, but that would be giving this waste some level of credibility it doesn't deserve, so I will keep it brief.

There is just nothing that is funny, unique, inventive, memorable or worthwhile on this disc.  It is the story of Fry, who gains the ability to read minds, a shifty cult, and LeLa joining a Enviro-Femi-Nazi group whose goal is to stop Amy's dad from building a mini golf course.  It was just so poorly put together, with no real character, lines, dialog or plot that it was a waste of time, even worse than ""Beast with a Billion Backs""

Anyway, only watch this if you are a DIE HARD Futurama fan, otherwise save your money and watch almost anything else, or read a book.

Nothing was funny.  As much as I love Futurama for its clever humor... this was more of hubris than humor.  The makers of this disaster must have assumed if fans are dumb enough to pay over $20 for the first three ""movies"" of mediocrity that they would pay the same or more for this stinker.  Jokes are more ""heh"" than ""haha"" and the story was just doo doo.  Stick with the original 4 seasons of comedy and abandon these sorry excuses for movies.  Its just a bunch of cliches similar to what made 'Gold Member' bomb in the Austin Powers series.  This is the biggest Futurama fan there is typing this so heed my warning if you want to preserve the dignity of the characters lol.

3699736,3,B001MT7ZI8,"As with the previous three movies, this movie is feature length but was made to be cut into about 4 episodes to be played on tv. (And there's going to be new episodes! Yay!) The only thing about 'Green Yonder' is that it's very obvious that it is a bunch of episodes strung together.

This movie has the characters watching the destruction of the Mars version of Las Vegas & seeing the Wongs build a new resort... and displacing the native wildlife & greenery in the process. Infuriated, Leela vows that she'll stop the Wong's latest project- a massive golf course that will destroy a planet full of life in the process. Meanwhile Fry gains telepathy via a necklace lodged in his cranium & finds that (as usual) he's being relied on to save the universe. And of course since it's Fry, he'll more than likely bungle much of it in the process.

I really did like this movie, it's just that this didn't flow together as well as some of the previous movies did. It's pretty easy to see where the episodes were supposed to begin & end. It doesn't make the movie unwatchable by any means, but it does sort of interrupt the viewing flow. We all know that they're going to be sliced up into episodes, but it just makes for a jarring watching experience. Then there's also the humor- it was good but it just wasn't up to par with the humor in some of the other movies. (I'm not even going to bother comparing it to the humor in the tv show- that would be like comparing dollar store chocolate to Godiva's best.)

Now there are some bonuses to this- when the humor is good, it's good. I do also like that this movie tries incredibly hard to move some older plot points along & resolve them so they could move into new plot territory for the upcoming season. I do like some of the stories in this movie & I think that if I'd seen them as individual episodes, they would've been even better. It's just the movie's flow just sort of pulls some of the humor apart.

This is a movie that's going to be a definite buy for Futurama collectors. If you aren't into buying everything Futurama, I still recommend renting this at the very least. It isn't the strongest of the movies put out, but it's still enjoyable.",1257552000,,2195,4.385749385749386

3699749,5,B001MT7ZI8,"Into the Wild Green Yonder was an uneven entry in the seies. But I do have to say that I did enjoy watching my favorites even jokes fell flat.  There are so many ideas that could be done as Futurama Movies.  How about The Voyage to the Bottom of Benders Brain? The Starship Benderprise?  Have Shater be the voice of Zap Branagan's father?  Those are just a few that we will never see!

The whole marriage scene with Amy Wong and Kif just fell flat.  I was expecting a little more in the way of the two coming together.  The Las Vagas opening with the protesters wasn't a good way to open this film at all. I was hoping for more sci fi oriented riffs and tributes.

I do have to wonder the pressure that was on the powers that be. The writing wasn't there.  It seems like the half hour format makes the jokes better.  Couldn't the  concepts in the Futurama comics be adapted as movies?  I did notice the humor was better paced than this movie was.  I don't know the process Fox uses to decide if this was funny enough. More writers have to work on one script. For all it's faults it was good to see the Robot Mafia was still around.",1249862400,,1131,4.180555555555555

I own every single episode of Futurama which are all on my iPod, so I watch them constantly.  The ""A"" and ""B"" stories were okay, but the mini-story lines within the major-line stories were lame and irrelevant. I loved Bender's Game and especially Bender's Big Score, but this is the worst of the four. I originally gave this movie one star, but just because I am a true Futurama fan for life, I gave it an extra star for just existing.  I still love you, Futurama!",1245456000,2,630,4.5

The characters, save for Bender, the Professor (and maybe Leela), didn't act like themselves (witty, insightful Fry?), the jokes were just boring for the most part, and the film in general just seemed to contrived and stretched out a lot longer than it should've been.

Now, I do happen to think it was better than ""The Beast With a Billion Backs"", but it's nowhere near as good as the first film and pales in comparison to the series. The only really good thing to point out is that the little event at the very end should've been them back at the 18th hole, leaving open the possibility of bringing back the series and, hopefully, this time, keeping in its proper format.

All in all a lackluster finale for the greatest animated comedy series in history.",1244851200,,824,4.5608108108108105

The movie is a jumbled mess of political messages, odd characters and one liners.  It feels like a complete waste of time.  Nothing in this movie felt consistent with characters or the old show.  It is like they took these characters and stuck them in a completely unrelated political commercial.  I didn't laugh once.  It is too bad.

Great show, great extras, I really hope they keep making them like this.  When I think back to a lot of other 30-minute TV shows that tried to make something feature length, it generally just falls flat (coughsimpsonscough) but the Futurama writers know their stuff and all of these post-network releases have been awesome.  I will gladly pay-to-play for as long as they keep making them.

Although I have to say, I'd also like to see them try something like this: Drop the extras, go back to a 30 minute format and release the episodes straight to Amazon Unbox or iTunes for a couple bucks per episode and see how that sells.  I would eat something like that UP.  You could still collect them and release them in DVD format with commentary later on but I could really go for some more frequent Futurama.

I like it either way, I'm just sayin', there are other ways to get my money if the feature-length idea ever loses steam.

(Edit: Oh, I have to say I was kind of disappointed when they had literally the entire cast for every audio commentary on every Fururama DVD EXCEPT Lauren Tom (Amy).  She's always missing from the extras/commentary.  In this DVD, there is an entire extra feature that consists of just her.

Although we have long agreed that Futurama is the funniest TV show ever, this final installment left us both with a bad taste in our mouths.

The first two movies were pretty good, and the third one wasn't so bad, but Green Yonder was difficult to watch to the end. The characters are the same, but it seems like an entirely different universe where plots don't have to lead anywhere and jokes don't have to technically be ""funny""--just a pop culture reference will do, or maybe a statement (or twelve) about how men and women are different. And since when does Futurama use self-conscious jokes like ""Oh, no, a rooster crowing indicates that it's the following day""? My friend chuckled when Bender said ""me, Bender,"" but I don't think I laughed the whole time, and I'm pretty sure I was cringing.

Please, if you love Futurama and quality TV and funny comedy, be prepared if you decide to make this the last you see of Futurama. Just go find some quotes online or something first, then make an educated decision on how to proceed. Oh, how I wish I could unwatch it. I would unwatch it.

The series episodes were always about the little things -- sly cultural references (often glimpsed only briefly in the background), snappy one-liners, and character tics. Plot lines were usually only secondary. That's OK for 22-23 minutes, but a movie-length production requires a more coherent story line and continuity. ""Wild Green Yonder"" feels like four TV episodes strung together, and the result is less than the sum of the parts.

Mr. Wong's business ventures provoke a group of flamboyant eco-feminists' ire who repeatedly and consistently attempt to disrupt his projects. With Fry and the gang taking different sides in the ensuing conflict, the final showdown might have much more at stake than a greedy man's business schemes. The movie makes some cool references to Dune and Star Trek, while all the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come alive)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all excellent!
Following the cancellation of the show (I wonder what ""genius"" came up with that idea???) life was pretty hard without these amazing characters. The comic books are good, but nothing beats the actual show, so it's so good to have everybody back.
Into the Wild Green Yonder is strongly recommended along with the other three Futurama films: Bender's Big Score, The Beast with a Billion Backs, and Bender's Game.

3699766,3,B001MT7ZI8,"I love Futurama and given that, I can at least sit through these movies. However, the movies seem to move further from the original concept of the show. Maybe it's just trying to make things funny throughout in a feature length film is just hard for someone used to writing a 23 minute show. I don't know, but the films haven't been that faithful to the show, to say the least.

Out of the other films that I've seen, this one pulled the most laughs for the most part. Bender had a few good jokes, Dr. Zoidberg even got a few good ones in, but then there's the overshadowing of 'being green' that just ruined the movie. Matt Greoning really needs to quit making everything about keeping things green. The Simpsons movie had the same overtone, and this movie, however not as bad, is just covered in overtones that 'if you're not green, you're scum'. Futurama had it's moments in the show, but they were usually funny situations too. This movie just seems to really be pressing it's view on the viewer, rather than having fun with it. I don't care if you want to be green or if you want to throw in something about being green, but to really just pollute a movie with it like Greoning has done with all of the Futurama movies and his Simpsons movie. Sure, we should take care about the earth, but I'm tired of seeing it everywhere, especially in my favorite show. Just stop pushing it.

Other than that huge complaint I had with the film, the comedy flashes between dull to funny over and over. Most of the chracters feel more like themselves than the previous two films, which helped me get through the movie. For those interested in Futruama, you'll purchase regardless of the complant.

They story is fun, the jokes sometimes clever, sometimes tired and the animation as good as ever.  But it all feels like we've been here before, recently, four times.

None of the movie length features measures up to the quality of the episodes, but as another reviewer observed, that was a rather high bar.

After watching the second film, The Beast With A Billion Backs, I thought I liked it - sort of - but then couldn't bring myself to watch it again. I tried, but that opening on Kiff's homeworld just put me right off. I realised that I didn't like this film at all.

The third film, Bender's Game, I found myself drifting through, then fast-forwarding through it, and finally I switched it off without finishing it. It made me angry to see just how much Futurama was losing it's way.

After watching this ""final"" film, Into the Wild Green Yonder, it felt like the tone, pace and style of Futurama had come full circle. Much more like it! If you just skip the middle two films, the first and last of these four will make a great and worthy additions to your Futurama collection. I don't want to spoil the plot, but the pace is tight (unlike the detours of the last two) and there are some really funny jokes too. In short, Fry is able to read minds and wears a tinfoil hat for most of the film!

Perhaps the Writer's Guild strike hurt the middle two films, or perhaps the Futurama folks just lost their way momentarily. So what is next? Everyone seems to want a sixth season of episodes, and it is increasingly likely that this will happen soon. As long as the writers don't forget the show's roots (it is easy to forget that Fry came from 1999 and is still a bit of a fish out of water and should retain some wonder at the world he lives in), keep the characters real, and mix in some of the new zeitgeist of the Obama era (Futurama started at a time when it looked like the nerdy environmentalist Al Gore was about to become President - that future never materialised, which perhaps led towards the show's demise as the mood of the era went far darker.) But with Obama in power, the future looks decidedly Futurama - and the time is perfect for Fox to bring back this show!! As Bender has said ""We're Back Baby!!!""",1237334400,2,2180,4.283980582524272

The end of an era, again, maybe. This is set to be the last direct to DVD Futurama and the series bows out gracefully. Futurama was denied a graceful ending to its television days and I am glad to see it was able to capture it here.

I hope this isn't the end of the story, but I'd rather see this be the last one than to see the series go downhill.

However, it does kind of become an addiction after your first taste, because then you want to see all of the shows and learn more about each of the characters and how they develop, etc. Only to learn that you are at the end of what was a Great show!

There are plenty of fresh jokes in 'Into the Wild Green Yonder' as well as plenty of fresh ideas, it is just that in my opinion the last Movie; 'Benders Game' was a little more creative and had a bit stronger movie concept then this final episode. This is not to say that this final episode is weak in any form, If I were to rate these four movies I would rate this last one and Benders Game as the two best of the four1

But I guess that if one is to think about how you would end a show like this, there are so many 'easy routes to end it and just call it a day with out putting too much work into the last of the four, like so many other television shows do. The makers of Futurama did do an above average job at closing things out. (Basically they didn't dwell on the 'sappy' ending that it could have been and they didn't do what is know known as the 'Saprano's' style ending!). The story line is very creative and like always a bit reflective on humanity and our overall existence, which may fit into many people's idea of our inevitable course of being. The creators at Futurama have an interesting way of looking at divergent viewpoints when it comes to politics and humanity. They have the ability and use it with out being preachy or self righteous about these things. And I find it very interesting the way they did choose to end it. With out trying to give too much away it is a bit biblical in a way that it seems that only Futurama can do.

As a fan who owns all of the television episodes and has watched them more times then I care to remember, (Thanks to an Archos 605, without which I have no idea how I have ever flown on a plane or even watched late night videos w/o bothering anyone before?) I have also watched all of the Movies as well as own them I can say that I am sad to see a creative show like this fade into television history! I will say that if you have the chance to take a look at the extra s in some of the movies, there are some very interesting pieces well worth watching, especially if you are like me and a bit geeky!

I will say that if you find the show even a bit interesting the movies are definitely worth owning in your collection. As I am sure you will find yourself watching these movies more then one time and in doing you will let yourself in on the inside jokes as well as some of the more creative aspects of the show.",1236556800,,3360,4.101823708206687

Don't get me wrong. Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder is ok and all, but it suffers from the same problem as two of the other three direct-to-DVD movies (the exception being Bender's Game), in that it just doesn't feel like the show did.

Part of this is because they are doing it as a movie rather than as episodes, but it was written in an episodic form so it can be aired later on Comedy Central. You don't have to reach too far to see where the episode cuts are, and that causes plot lines developed in episode one (like Bender's seduction of a fine ladybot), to be dropped well before episode four.

Still, it had its funny moments and there wasn't anything particularly wrong with it. I just hope that if they do more Futurama they have the good sense to go back to doing it as seasons and not these little movies, cause just don't work.",1236211200,3,981,4.235294117647059

The plot wonders into tangents that never go anywhere.  At times it literally felt like they meant to come back and follow up on some of them, and then forgot.  (I.e., the Don-Bot affair story)  The humor was weak and the voice acting was fairly bad at times for these seasoned veterans.  I actually questioned myself a couple of times as to whether they replaced a few of the voice actors.  Of course they didn't, it was either bad directing or the actors just weren't into it at times.

Something else to keep in mind is, this particular Futurama release is particularly politically charged.  If your politics are left of center, you probably won't mind.  If they are right of center, you'll note that they glorify Code Pink, embrace violent activism, and all become environmentalists now that ""the dark one"" is gone (I wish they made a pill for BDS).",1235952000,9,1057,4.5396825396825395

3699818,4,B001MT7ZI8,"If this fourth full-length Futurama flick really is the end once and for all, it's a fitting conclusion because it leaves enough loose strings for future development and also adequately wraps up what has been a pretty inconsistent series of DVD movies. This one has a creative premise involving the latest theories of cosmology (for example, see modern egghead speculation on black and violet dwarf stars), skillfully combined with a unique environmental message, and many ongoing subplots from the Futurama saga are wrapped up in a fulfilling fashion.

But as we have seen with these films, the execution of the plotline leaves something to be desired, and the problem is adapting the lean-and-mean storytelling of the 22-minute TV episodes to over-ambitious and sometimes bloated 88-minute movie scripts. Here the storyline is not mapped out very well. An early premise involving Mars Vegas, poker, and the Robot Mafia disappears about a third of the way through as the film makes an awkward transition into the main storyline of ecofeminism and an ancient secret society. More specifically, Fry is given a secret power in this flick but how he gets it doesn't make much sense; and except for one in-joke about whale oil, this flick bears no connection to the last one (Bender's Game) and its blockbuster cliffhanger concerning energy supplies. There is also still trouble here with the consistency of the characters, and this time it's Bender whose behavior doesn't always follow his established patterns.

On the good side, the true premise of this flick, once it finally gets off the ground, is fascinating and a bit thought provoking, and Leela and Amy get some room to roam as unlikely ecofeminists. The insightful and deep comedy of the TV series is in pretty good form here, and the skill and creativity of the animation is top-notch as always. As for this DVD package, the extras aren't much to write home about, but the short mockumentary ""Futurama: The Making of It"" starring voice actress Lauren Tom is pretty funny. And when all is said and done, the grand conclusion of this supposedly final flick, while a bit forced, works as both the ultimate conclusion to the Futurama saga and as seeds for future revival. While it's been a bumpy ride with these feature-length flicks, I wouldn't be sad to see the Futurama universe born again... again. [~doomsdayer520~]",1235865600,2,2374,5.007594936708861

Oh, and when did the decision to include that many 2009 product and brand names get approved?  None of them made any sense in the context of the future.  There used to be clever alternate brands, not Nine West and iPod and the half dozen other jarringly-obvious brand placements.

*Uhhh...where to start? There's just a whole bunch of stuff going on; some green chi sweeps across the galaxy, giving new life to dead asteroids and planets; the Wongs trample all life in their way to build a new Las-Vegas-type city on Mars and the galaxy's biggest mini-golf course; and then a group of feminist activists try to stop them; and then Bender has an affair with the wife of the robot mafia's ""donbot""; Fry starts to hear voices; and then everything kind-of works out in the end...

The Good News, Everyone!
*Superb video/sound quality. It is practically perfect on Blu-Ray; the details are sharp, clear, vivid. The color is great and the picture has no defects that I can see.  I'm sure that the regular DVD is splendid too.
*Includes some good special features; commentaries, animatics, featurettes, and deleted scenes.
*Excellent animation quality.
*Has some great hilarious dialogue and funny scenes (without relying too heavily on catch phrases or old gags). Also has plenty of action.
*A few funny parodies throughout.
*One or two funny puns.
*Also makes good fun of modern-day issues, particularly concerning environmentalism.
*A few of nostalgic homages to older Futurama episodes (expect to see some familiar characters and references). Everything is accurate to what the show was.
*Characters are still great and funny.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*Probably not for kids; contains one or two scenes with blood, a bit of swearing, and some innuendo.

The Questionable Things
*The story is kind of weird.  It starts off in one direction, but totally ends up in a different way.  I suppose all of these movies have been this way, but in this case, it seemed particularly strange.
*I found the ending somewhat satisfying; it ties up the characters in an okay fashion and leaves everything open for more stories (this ending actually reminded me of other sci-fi endings, like the ""Lost in Space"" movie).  It may disappoint other viewers though.

This is one final hurrah for fans of the show.  It's not great in the same way ""Bender's Big Score"" or ""Bender's Game"" was, but I would say that this is still better than ""The Beast With a Billion Backs.""

Other than that, it was okay...besides the fact that (as other reviewers have already mentioned) there was a long stretch in the middle with NO laughs at all.  And contrary to everyone who says they're happy with the way Fry and Leela were brought together at the end, I thought it was rather forced and almost entirely unconvincing...not nearly as good as the way they ended the actual tv series.  Although the line ""I only need to know you're you"" was pretty sweet.

I guess the bottom line is that it's worth seeing once, if only for closure---but it's probably only worth buying if you're a die-hard fan.",1235692800,2,1030,4.720670391061453
3699823,3,B001MT7ZI8,"The final film in the Futurama series caters the most to diehard fans. The gags, characters, running themes, and inside jokes fuel the majority of the show, leaving the usual creative science fiction parodies rather lacking. Familiarity with the regular crew of the Planet Express is essential for Into the Wild Green Yonder, although many of the funniest riffs belong to the severed head of Richard Nixon, who is once again the president (of Earth) - for which you only need to be well-versed in his shortcomings.

Popular Mars Vegas is demolished for New Vegas, an even more luxurious gambling paradise, run by Amy's wealthy father Leo Wong. Leela (Katey Sagal) becomes concerned with the destruction of the environment and wildlife from Wong's building plans, and sets out to save the Violet Dwarf star, a lush, inhabited planet full of life that marks the final demolition zone for a giant miniature golf course being constructed as the central attraction for New Vegas. After she saves the very last desert muck leech from extinction, she becomes the leader of a band of protesting environmentalists (eco-feminists) determined to put a stop to the devastating development.

Meanwhile, Fry (Billy West) discovers he's a mind reader, and is introduced to a secret underground organization known as the Legion of Madfellows. He realizes that it is also his destiny to save the Violet Star, despite the rising forces of government (in the form of Nixon's head) and space police (the overconfident Captain of the Nimbus, Zapp Brannigan) bent on stopping both Fry and the pesky eco-feminists. Wildcard robot Bender (John Di Maggio) plays all sides for his own selfish, despicable gain (as usual), while having an affair with the Donbot's wife Fanny.

Into the Wild Green Yonder does the best job of all four Futurama films in concealing the fact that it is several episodes tied together, creating a fairly linear storyline that doesn't deviate as much in common goals and plots for each of the characters as the previous movies. Nixon's head and Zapp Brannigan once again get the best lines in the show and steal the spotlight from many of the other, subtler jokes, most of which depend on the viewer's knowledge of the Futurama universe. Snoop Dogg gets a cameo as the Supreme Court Chief Justice (a few of the other judges include the heads of Bjork, Janeane Garofalo and Paula Abdul), as does Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Nearly every major and minor character throughout the series makes a brief appearance (yes, even Hedonismbot) and the conclusion wraps things up neatly (almost as if the four feature-length films were meant to close the series as opposed to jumpstart viewer interest). It's well worthwhile for followers of the previous films and the regular TV show; however, this isn't the episode to start with to become a fanatic.

3699824,3,B001MT7ZI8,"Futurama:  Into the Wild Green Yonder

Break out the Slurm, I'm back baby! Or is it?  Throughout the entire final installment of the four Futurama straight to DVD movies, Futurama Into the Wild Green Yonder, we are given in your face clues as to weather or no the series will continue.  With all the concern about being green, was this movie really about the ending of a series or a political message about the environment rolled into an hour and a half movie?  Die hard Futurama fans will find closure but newcomers will be left wondering what was this show all about.
This installment of the Futurama movie series does not leave off where the previous one ended, but starts out entirely new.  The original opening theme is replaced with the crew flying through ""old Mars Vegas,"" instead of New New York.  With the establishing shot set, Old Mars Vegas is blown up by Mr. and Mrs. Wong, Planet Express intern Amy Wong's extremely wealthy parents, to make way for a new bigger and better Mars Vegas.  With the Wong's owning a large portion of Mars, anyone from contractors to environmental sciencetist (Prof. Farnsworth) can be bought to disregard endangered species that thrive in this rural environment.  Leela and Amy form a women's activist group to bring down the construction that will endanger the environment and animals.  As for Fry, he finds out that he can read minds (because of his Delta brain wave) and tries to secretly help Leela in her fight against Mr. Wong.
Into the Wild Green Yonder is about environmentalism on a universal scale.  I am all about saving the environment, I use compact florescent bulbs and I unplug appliances when I go on vacation, but when it comes to the final installment of a series I have loved since the beginning, I wanted a bit more.  Like more of Fry and Leela's on again, off again, married, divorced romance.  Throughout the movie each of the main characters is off doing their own thing and hardly in the same scene together.  Bender, having an affair with a married women, Fry and the tree hugging, tin foil wearing number 9 guy and Leela with her eco feminist group.
There were some LOL moments for me during the film, but not many.  From the beginning Futurama has been a funny and in your face show.  With the movies fans got a taste of what they were craving.  But overall with the ""end"" of a series a taste is better than nothing.  When all is said and done fans of the Futurama franchise will be left wondering will the series be brought back after this ""last"" movie?  Only time, or DVD sales, will tell.

Now the review of the movie:  I was hesitant as I slipped the DVD into my jukebox and took a deep breath as I grabbed the remote control and pressed PLAY.  I was quietly telling myself not to judge this movie against any other, and I'm glad I took my own advice.  This time, it paid off - what a good storyline and what a good movie overall!

About halfway thru the movie, however, perhaps you'll notice (as I did) that it seemed to be two separate stories, or episodes, combined into one.  That is to say, one can tell where the movie will end when it is shown on TV, and when the 'next episode' will begin.  I don't know if this was intentional, but it plays as if it were still just the TV show (two episodes worth) and not a full-length feature.

3699827,3,B001MT7ZI8,"First of all, let me say that I enjoyed this movie. I laughed at a good deal of the jokes and appreciated all the call-backs to earlier Futurama episodes (especially to Fry's mental condition) and solid characterization.

Now the bad news. Instead of the space opera epic that the writers had hinted at, the final Futurama is an environmental protection episode. While this is indeed a noble cause, it doesn't deliver the meaningful final send-off for the good folks at Planet Express.

As long-time fans will know, most of the environmentally themed Futurama are marked with appearances by the ""Waterfall"" family. Debuting in ""The Problem with Popplers"" (sic?) this seemingly inexhaustible family line always heralds a ""message"" episode. The problem is: with the exception of the first appearance in ""Popplers"" these episodes tend to be both heavy-handed and weak. (""Freedom Day"" and ""Birdbot of Icecatraz"" were not fan favorites) ""Into the Wild Green Yonder"" follows this trend, unfortuantly. Had this been any old episode it would be immeadiately forgivable, but as this is possibly the last time we'll see Futurama it is not.

The movie starts very strong with Fry gaining an interesting power and Bender pushing his luck against him in a poker match. Their roles stay more or less solid throughout the film. It's Leela's role as a member of a feminist environmental group that is the weakest point of the movie. (especially after her amazing subplot in the previous movie) The group itself is meant to be a satire but it comes of as more of a tired cliche. The afforementioned ""Waterfall family"" member isn't even well-done for a cliche!

What's most disappointing isn't so much the tale the movie tells as much as HOW it is told. Fans are obviously expecting a romantic subplot between Fry and Leela and it does exist, but lacks the build-up and emotional tension that is present in even some of the 30-minute episodes. (""Parasites Lost"" for example) It seems a little tacked on. I will say that the writers did have a lot to sandwich into a 2 hour movie. Pretty much every character in the series' history has at least one line.

This is a solid movie and a lot of fun, but I can defintely say that it is not the incredible ending that these amazing characters deserved. It's possible that it was left open for more episodes and, if that's the case, I completely understand the decision to save the best stuff for later :)",1235520000,6,2429,4.801435406698564

3699832,5,B001MT7ZI8,"They're back baby! Futurama returns to form after the two previous duds that were Bender's Game and The Beast with a Billion Backs. I was worried that Futurama was past its prime and that maybe it should end after movie #4. But after seeing ""Into the Wild Green Yonder"" I hope that Futurama is just getting started again!

The movie starts off with our crew enjoying a vacation in New Mars Vegas developed by Amy Wong's parents moments after demolishing old Mars Vegas. During the construction, the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective led by Frida Waterfall come to protest against Leo Wong. Fry gets injured in an explosion and gains telepathic powers after a piece of a necklace is logged in his skull. Leela eventually gets fed up with Leo Wong's plan to demolish a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy to build an enormous miniature golf course and joins the Feminitos. From this point, the main story arcs develop:

1) Leela and her eco-feminists work to save a violet dwarf star and a primordial planet. After President Nixon and Zapp Brannigan are bought off by Leo Wong, Leela and the other women of Futurama become fugitives.

2) Fry meets a homeless bum named Hutch who teaches him to block the constant noise of other people's thoughts with a tinfoil hat and is brought into a secret society led by the number 9 man. He must find out who the Dark Ones are and protect the violet dwarf star from destruction.

3) Bender falls in love with the Don Bot's wife, wins a poker tournament, and double crosses most everyone.

4) Everyone comes together in the end to watch Leo Wong's demolition of the dwarf star, the Dark One is revealed, and our crew end the movie fleeing into a worm hole and a touching moment. I hope Futurama returns again!

This movie is massive, though not epic in how much story is laid out. Overall I would say that Bender's Big Score was the biggest story, which you really had to pay attention to in order not to get lost. Billion Backs and Bender's Game were just long. Into the Wild Green Yonder is enjoyable, interesting, and very smooth all the way through. I felt that Billion Backs and Bender's Game were pretty jerky and showed their seams too easily while Bender's Big Score was busy but fluid. Into the Wild Green Yonder is the most seamless movie and feels more like it was always intended to be a feature-length movie rather than be broken into several episodes.

The characterization in this movie is very strong, our heroes act like themselves without being flat or one dimensional like I felt they were in Bender's Game. Happily our characters aren't overly predictable and aren't stuck throwing out recycled gags.

The animation, as always, is incredible. Colors are vibrant, 3D animation is well blended and just plain cool, and there are many visual treats to be had. This is one of the reasons I loved watching Futurama so much during its original television run. There is plenty of freeze-frame fun for fans (whoa, 5 f's!) but not much in the secret jokes or science/math references department. The movie looks stunning on Blu-ray in widescreen, I highly recommend it over the regular DVD!

The audio is in 5.1 surround and fits the movie well. The Sinatra-esqe song at the beginning is performed by Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy fame and has a nice bit of the Futurama theme thrown in. The rest of the musical score works just fine for the movie, I just wish it was a full orchestral one like we got in the TV broadcast days. Oh well.

Both the DVD and Blu-ray are packed with lots of extra features:

* As with all previous Futurama DVD releases, there is an audio commentary track for the whole movie on which members of the Futurama crew including creator Matt Groening and executive producer David X. Cohen give background information while having a good time. [The Blu-ray includes the commentary with video overlays.]

* Other random goodies include a funny Behind the Scenes with Amy's voice and jack-of-all-trades Lauren Tom

* An animatic of the first 22 minutes

* Guides on how to draw Futurama characters

* Five deleted scenes

* 3D models with discussion by the designers

* Zapp Brannigan's guide on ""how to make love at a woman""

* Bender's cinema etiquette

* A ""toilet paper"" animation

* And a short featurette with Penn Jillette, Matt Groening and David X. Cohen in ""space"".

Very good amount of extras in my opinion. The other unique feature to the Blu-ray would be the more fluid menu design.

So in closing, I am very happy with Into the Wild Green Yonder as far as the movie itself and the Blu-ray. After getting worried about, what I feel to be a mediocre performance in Billion Backs and Bender's Game, I am glad to see movie #4 pack in a lot of the elements that made the series what it was. Great voice acting, fun story, geeky references (anyone spot the Botany Bay?), and fantastic animation. If you've ever liked ANY part of any episode of Futurama this is a sure-fire addition to your movie collection.",1235347200,2,4985,4.634506242905789
3699833,5,B001MT7ZI8,"They're back baby!  Futurama returns to form after the two previous duds that were Bender's Game and The Beast with a Billion Backs.  I was worried that Futurama was past its prime and that maybe it should end after movie #4.  But after seeing ""Into the Wild Green Yonder"" I hope that Futurama is just getting started again!

The movie starts off with our crew enjoying a vacation in New Mars Vegas developed by Amy Wong's parents moments after demolishing old Mars Vegas.  During the construction, the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective led by Frida Waterfall come to protest against Leo Wong.  Fry gets injured in an explosion and gains telepathic powers after a piece of a necklace is logged in his skull.  Leela eventually gets fed up with Leo Wong's plan to demolish a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy to build an enormous miniature golf course and joins the Feminitos. From this point, the main story arcs develop:

1) Leela and her eco-feminists work to save a violet dwarf star and a primordial planet.  After President Nixon and Zapp Brannigan are bought off by Leo Wong, Leela and the other women of Futurama become fugitives.

2) Fry meets a homeless bum named Hutch who teaches him to block the constant noise of other people's thoughts with a tinfoil hat and is brought into a secret society led by the number 9 man.  He must find out who the Dark Ones are and protect the violet dwarf star from destruction.

3) Bender falls in love with the Don Bot's wife, wins a poker tournament, and double crosses most everyone.

4) Everyone comes together in the end to watch Leo Wong's demolition of the dwarf star, the Dark One is revealed, and our crew end the movie fleeing into a worm hole and a touching moment.  I hope Futurama returns again!

This movie is massive, though not epic in how much story is laid out.  Overall I would say that Bender's Big Score was the biggest story, which you really had to pay attention to in order not to get lost.  Billion Backs and Bender's Game were just long.  Into the Wild Green Yonder is enjoyable, interesting, and very smooth all the way through.  I felt that Billion Backs and Bender's Game were pretty jerky and showed their seams too easily while Bender's Big Score was busy but fluid.  Into the Wild Green Yonder is the most seamless movie and feels more like it was always intended to be a feature-length movie rather than be broken into several episodes.

The characterization in this movie is very strong, our heroes act like themselves without being flat or one dimensional like I felt they were in Bender's Game.  Happily our characters aren't overly predictable and aren't stuck throwing out recycled gags.

The animation, as always, is incredible.  Colors are vibrant, 3D animation is well blended and just plain cool, and there are many visual treats to be had.  This is one of the reasons I loved watching Futurama so much during its original television run.  There is plenty of freeze-frame fun for fans (whoa, 5 f's!) but not much in the secret jokes or science/math references department.  The movie looks stunning on Blu-ray in widescreen, I highly recommend it over the regular DVD!

The audio is in 5.1 surround and fits the movie well.  The Sinatra-esqe song at the beginning is performed by Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy fame and has a nice bit of the Futurama theme thrown in.  The rest of the musical score works just fine for the movie, I just wish it was a full orchestral one like we got in the TV broadcast days.  Oh well.

Both the DVD and Blu-ray are packed with lots of extra features:

* As with all previous Futurama DVD releases, there is an audio commentary track for the whole movie on which members of the Futurama crew including creator Matt Groening and executive producer David X. Cohen give background information while having a good time. [The Blu-ray includes the commentary with video overlays.]

* Other random goodies include a funny Behind the Scenes with Amy's voice and jack-of-all-trades Lauren Tom

* An animatic of the first 22 minutes

* Guides on how to draw Futurama characters

* Five deleted scenes

* 3D models with discussion by the designers

* Zapp Brannigan's guide on ""how to make love at a woman""

* Bender's cinema etiquette

* A ""toilet paper"" animation

* And a short featurette with Penn Jillette, Matt Groening and David X. Cohen in ""space"".

3699834,5,B001MT7ZI8,"Prepare yourself for another hilarious film in the ""Futurama"" universe!

The crew of Planet Express are in another hilarious adventure as the crew takes a look at New Mars Vegas and learn more about Leo Wong's goal of creating another golf course.  Of course, by doing so, he's destroying any natural vegetation that still exists, as well as exterminating living life that reside on the planet's underground system which prompts a group of Eco-Feminists who protest Wong's golf constructions.

And to make things more interesting, Wong wants to take his passion for golf to the Milky Way and like he has done in New Mars Vegas, he will do to the Milky Way and destroy things to get this way.

Due to Wong's actions, this causes Turanga Leela, Amy Wong and LeBarbara Conrad to join the Eco-feminist protesters and lead them on crusades against Wong.

As for Philip, he somehow gains a power of reading minds that leads him to a crazy group of people known as the Legion of Mad Fellows who believe that Fry's new talents is a gift to save the universe.

And as for Bender, let's just say he finds some mad love with a fembot who happens to be the wife of a Donbot in the mafia.

Expect a lot of outrageous hijinks, all-out fun and crazy adventures as the crew of Planet Express are pit against each other.

Featured in widescreen 1:78:1, you get a good balance of digital and 3D-based artwork.  Some parts that are quite vibrant and overall good uses of color throughout the film.

As for the audio, audio is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD and there were good uses of rear speaker usage during scenes that involve action-based scenes to parts that include a lot of people and you can hear crowds on the rear speakers.

At the main menu on the roulette table, hit left with your remote and the center of the roulette table will be selectable. You will find a ""Congratulations - You have found a very obscure Futurama DVD Extra"" which is Billy West voice acting as Zapp Brannigan.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder"" is another hilarious and enjoyable ""FUTURAMA"" film.  I think it's also pretty good timing for a Blu-ray release since there have been no television episodes currently in production  but the films on DVD and Blu-ray, fans can still look forward to the characters.  And sales for ""Futurama"" on DVD have been quite positive.

""Into the Wild Green Yonder"" definitely was enjoyable to watch on Blu-ray.  Picture and audio quality was quite good and there are many special features included, so this release was definitely worthwhile.

The fourth Futurama film is a hilarious take on women's independence, ecology, corporate greed, taking care of endangered species, robot love and more. Definitely incorporates the wackiness that one expects from the television series and previous films.  All-out fun!

I've read that the goal for four films of ""Futurama"" was that they would be split up into sixteen episodes for a fifth season on television.  But in a recent interview with Wired, head writer David X. Cohen would not rule out more additional films straight-to-DVD or a theatrical release.

Personally, I think there is much life left in this series especially for the way this film ends.  The adventures of Planet Express crew definitely has more exciting potential for more outlandish adventures and much more possibilities for more hilarious, fresh and crazy storylines may it be for television, the Internet or straight-to-DVD or theatrical film!

Nevertheless, every character has their own contribution to the wackiness of this film.  And I have to say that of the four ""Futurama"" films released so far, this is by far my favorite.

""Futurama"" fans will definitely find enjoyment in this Blu-ray Disc release.",1235260800,18,6472,4.861974405850091
3699835,5,B001MT7ZI8,"Green Yonder is a great end to the 4-DVD Futurama series.  In fact, it might even edge out Bender's Game as my favorite of the quadrilogy.  As others have mentioned, these are long movies, clocking in at 1:30.  Bender's Game had a bit of a wandering plot, but Green Yonder manages to keep the storyline very cohesive while also throwing in plenty of laughs.  All the old characters are here, even grumpy snail, Zapp Brannigan, and HypnoToad on a MagnaPhallix 302"" TV.

The storyline involves Leo Wong (Amy's dad), and his quest to bulldoze or dynamite various celestial objects in order to build a mini-golf park.  Leela heads up a group of feminists in opposition.  And we get to discover the true purpose of the mysterious ""number 9 man"" who appears in the early Futurama seasons.  Surprisingly, the plot holds together well throughout all 1.5 hours.  Oh, and the storyline also involves a leech.

If Futurama were to end with Green Yonder, I wouldn't mind.

And now, let me leave you with these quotes.

Justice Scalia (after Leela is acquitted on a 5-4 vote): The vote was along gender lines, so the female Supreme Court justices' votes only count for half!

Calculon (rehearsing an Oscar acceptance speech): I'd like to thank my wife, my agent and my operating system, Windows Vista, for... <Calculon's eyes sputter as he goes blue screen of death>",1235174400,2,1353,4.780172413793103
3699836,1,B001MT7ZI8,"The fourth and final DVD movie shows, quite clearly, why episodic television rarely translates to feature length with any real appeal.

The first movie was pretty good, the following three are abysmal.

""Green Yonder"" doesn't sink quite to the depths of horribleness as ""Billion Backs"" does, but it's got few laughs (I chuckled exactly once) and watches like an episode that's four times longer than it needed to be.

I would rent or avoid this release.",1235088000,4,453,4.934210526315789
3699837,3,B001MT7ZI8,"Into The Wild Green Yonder is the fourth and final installment in the series of direct-to-video Futurama movies, all of which are scheduled to be cut up into quarters and be broadcast as a ""fifth season"" on TV.  While it's a decent enough episode in its own right and provides an poignant conclusion to the series, it demonstrates the difficulties (not insurmountable, but significant) in adapting Futurama's blend of witty satire, sci-fi action and character development to a feature film.

The first quarter of the movie shows our heroes enjoying a vacation in the New Mars Vegas, recently developed by Amy Wong's wealthy parents.  The whole chapter is lighthearted, enjoyable and plants two seeds of the main plot -- Fry gets injured in an accident and gains telepathic powers, while Leela becomes upset at the extent to which the construction is destroying the environment.  From here, the main story arcs develop:  Leela joins an eco-feminist collective devoted to saving a violet dwarf star and planet and becomes a fugitive; Fry joins a secret society and learns that that the violet dwarf system is a key element in a cosmic struggle for the fate of all biological life in the universe; Bender teams up with Zapp Brannigan and initiates a crucial plot twist.  The final scenes tie up a long-running thread in the Futurama saga and provide a touching (yet not excessively sentimental) conclusion to the Futurama series while leaving open the possibility of future adventures.

The massive, epic nature of the movie (a consequence of the feature-length format, as well as the writers' desire to go out with a bang) is responsible both for the strengths and the weaknesses of the episode.  On the one hand, the characterization throughout the movie is very strong.  Placed in stressful, completely unfamiliar circumstances, our heroes act in ways that are true to themselves for the most part without being overly predictable or coming off as caricatures of themselves.  The artistry is impressive as well -- many of the shots of outer space are breathtaking, the opening Sinatra-themed number is a hit, and alert viewers will recognize the return of some of the moving musical themes from a previous movie.  The writers and creative staff manage to take an epic adventure and make it connect with the viewer on a personal level.

On the other hand, the sci-fi content of the movie is sloppy and heavy-handed, with little of the nuance and subtlety of Futurama's previous ecologically-minded episodes.  In addition, the satirical wit and goofiness that is the hallmark of the Futurama franchise gradually peters out about halfway through the movie -- the jokes don't disappear as such, but most of them are exhausted running jibes, while the genuinely clever lines and gags are unable to lighten the mood of the episode, making portions of the film feel tense and grim.  It's clear that Futurama can become imbalanced when forced to adapt to the more massive, slower-developing story arcs of a feature-length film.

While this movie is certainly a mandatory purchase for devoted Futurama fans, who will appreciate the positive elements of this movie and be willing to leave the rest behind, novices are advised to start with the original series (or perhaps Bender's Big Score) before delving into the rest of the movies.  As for the future of Futurama, the writers still seem to be capable of producing fresh ideas, and the events of Into The Wild Green Yonder leave several issues open as fodder for future releases (Twentieth Century Fox has just confirmed that Comedy Central has ordered 26 new episodes, to begin airing in 2010).  Despite the unevenness of the movies, there's plenty of reason for optimism.",1234656000,30,3716,5.0064935064935066
