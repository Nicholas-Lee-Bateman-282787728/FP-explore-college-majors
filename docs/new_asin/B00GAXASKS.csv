6068726,5,B00GAXASKS,"This is a good collection of three classic Christie mysteries, and a blend of old and new adaptations.  The earlier two THE SEVEN DIALS  and WHY DIDNT THEY ASK EVANS? are from the early 1980s. This was the age of the multi-episode miniseries, and these two stories are well treated and full of details.  The 2003 SPARKLING CYANIDE is a modern adaptation of the story, with technology playing a large role in the process of solving the mystery.  This is not objectionable, and is a tribute in a sense to the timelessness of Agatha Christies characters and stories.  This set belongs in the collections of fans, and would be a nice introduction to her mysteries that aren't starring Poirot or Miss Marple.  Sir John Gielgud is splendid to watch in both the early mysteries, his performance in SEVEN DIALS sent me back to the Christie novel to see how much of the character is in her writing and how much was Sir Johns professional touch.  It is a happy blend of both.",1392076800,21,965,4.575581395348837
6068727,4,B00GAXASKS,"Three different mysteries from different collections.  Two of them are rather poor quality, but the content makes up for the picture quality.  I love these period pieces and having SDH subtitles is a must for my ""slightly deaf"" husband.",1391212800,6,236,5.0256410256410255
6068728,5,B00GAXASKS,"As a Christie collector, I'm always looking for ways to create space for the various wonderful uk sets of her work. This one is a real gem. WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS and THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY have been around for many years but both of them still stand up and these discs play well on a blu-ray player and a small screen. I have yet to try them on a larger screen. The real bonus is SPARKLING CYANIDE (2003) which started life as Yellow Iris, first as a short story and then in the David Suchet TV episode. The plot has been enlarged upon nicely here and updated for a modern audience, so there are surprises for those of us who know Christie, but the best part is the actors Pauline Collins and Oliver Ford Davies as a pair of retired spies who are asked to solve the murder. I wish they had done a whole series with these two and not just the one movie. They have a wonderful husband and wife give-and-take that is as much fun as the murder mystery. And it saves space on my shelf. Highly recommended for Christie fans who don't mind modern tinkering with Christie's stories.",1390867200,83,1079,4.294117647058823
6068729,5,B00GAXASKS,"This set is a fine group that not only abundantly reuses Britain's finest actors but also incorporates the bits of wit from Agatha Christie. For instance; John Gielgud is as funny in ""Seven dials"" as Maggie Smith is as Dowager in Downton Abbey. It's period mystery by the great Agatha Christie. Two episodes are from the 1980s, thus nostalgic as well, and with the complexity of sleuthing which Christie is known to produce. Watching some of these Brit stars, now departed, is worth the set's price.

SUBTITLES provided for all 3 episodes
SPARKLING CYANIDE -95 min.; 2003 TV; 1944 Saturday Evening Post serialization titled ""Remembered Death""
There is a table full of suspects when a nightclub partier is slipped a fatal Mickey Finn. The rich husband is played by Kenneth Cranham. The deceased's Aunt Lucilla played by Susan Hampshire (Pallisers). The complex case sets the government appointed MI5 couple to work: Col Reese (Oliver Ford Davies -Star Wars) and Dr. Catherine Kendall ( Pauline Collins -Upstairs, Downstairs). Not Collins' finest hour, but overall the show is typical Christie. Don't let the 2 seconds of nudity detour you, though I doubt it being A.C.'s intent.

WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? -186 min; 1980 TV; 1934 novel
This is one of the better adaptations of this story and stars Francesca Annis (Lillie) as Lady Derwent, a beautiful but amateur investigator. He's helped by the Vicar's son Bobby Jones (James Warwick), a not-so-good golfer who discovers a body not-quite-dead. With dying breath the cliff victim utters the story title question. Bobby also helps in amateur sleuthing. Who's Evans? It's a Wales to London tale. Also watch the screen for the appearance of Joan Hickson who would soon become Miss Marple for a decade. The Vicar by Sir John Gielgud (Brideshead Revisited) who will like others perform in the last episode in this set as well. As humorous as it is mysterious.

SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY -131 min; 1981 TV; 1929 novel
Another cleverly written A.C. humor/mystery with Gielgud as a funny Marquis of Caterhan. A titled Lady nicknamed ""Bundles"" (Cheryl Campbell) does the amateur sleuthing this time after a country house (Chimneys) murder...or two. It's a complicated mystery with a clue coming from the lips of another dying victim about ""Seven Dials."" Why? Who? What?
You will see Joyce Redman (Les Mis). James Warwick (Iron Man) returns from the previous episode as does Robert Longden (Beiderbecke TV trilogy) who is the 3rd actor appearing in both.

Expect 1980s TV, but good 80s. Plenty more top actors unmentioned. They all want to perform in an Agatha Christie episode. The mystery is always spot-on.",1389139200,29,2644,5.029680365296803

6068760,4,B00GAXASKS,"Very enjoyable series of movies. ""Sparkling Cyanide"" is similar to, but I didn't think quite as good as, Suchet's ""Yellow Iris"" (both I believe being based on Christie's original ""Remembered Death""). ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans"" and ""Seven Dials Mystery"" both stuck pretty close to the books and are good, light mysteries.",1443139200,3,321,5.1923076923076925
6068761,5,B00GAXASKS,"I have really enjoyed watching Agatha Christie's ""The Queen of Crime"".  I had only seen ""Miss Marple"" and ""Pirot"", so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But I was not disappointed.  Agatha Christie is a great mystery writer.",1442880000,,220,4.7368421052631575
6068762,5,B00GAXASKS,"this is my favorite Agatha Christie set, bought it when it first came out last Christmas of 13. The set consists of three mystery favorites of mine
why didn't they ask Evans, seven dials mystery & the 2003 version of sparkling cyanide which was filmed in London & sticked more to the book.
all three movies are better remastered & including subtitles. the actors who both played partners in crime from the 83 version are in all the movies which make it all worth the $ to buy them. The story lines are superb keep you guessing til the ending god bless Agatha Christie.",1442620800,,568,4.471153846153846

It probably would have been better, if I would have known any of the actors in the movies. I did watch all of them and I did enjoy watching them. They keep me wandering what was going to happen next.

6068780,2,B00GAXASKS,"I am a huge Agatha Christie fan.  I love Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple.  Perhaps that is why I dislike these mysteries so much.

""Sparkling Cyanide"" is confusing and implausible.  It has a murder similar to the one in Hercule Poirot's ""Yellow Iris"", but it lacks the logic and credibility of ""Yellow Iris"".

""Seven Dials"" is even less credible and more confusing.  Two members of group of men who went to college together are killed and both murders seem to be related to a secret group called the ""Seven Dials"".  A secret formula might get stolen at a mansion one weekend but there is no logic to how the formula is secured from theft or what to do with it if it is not stolen.  Several amateurs blunder trying to solve the mystery themselves.

""Why Didn't They Ask Evans"" was a good mystery for Miss Marple to solve.  But this version with bumbling amateurs takes a long time to even begin investigating the murder.  And then the amateurs fail to investigate obvious leads, get trapped by the bad guy(s), and have to be rescued by a Cambridge graduate who clearly isn't smart enough to finish high school.  I recommend the Miss Marple version.",1421712000,,1151,4.588235294117647
