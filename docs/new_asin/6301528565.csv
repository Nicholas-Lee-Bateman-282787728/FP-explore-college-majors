331770,4,6301528565,"I remember seeing this film in theatrical release and have always liked it. It seems to be ""loaded"" with the best, from director to actors. It has been on my ""hope soon"" list for release on DVD, so I am very pleased to see it. Okay, so Robert Wagner is a little wooden, but it doesn't detract from the story. Another movie in this vein is ""House of Strangers"" with Edward G. Robinson, Susan Hayward & Richard Conte. It is also a wonderful telling of the same story, done in black & white, only the family is in banking.",1116892800,2,519,4.252525252525253
331771,3,6301528565,"'Broken Lance' has many admirers, and there are many good things about this sober Western.  The film has been called an updated 'King Lear' - an all-powerful, tyrannical father unwisely cedes control (land) to his children, all turning against him except for the youngest, who is the most ill-used - but the adaptation is loose and mercifully unliteral: there are no raging storm scenes or impertinently wise Fools, just a grandeur-exuding atmosphere of a great man and the power he created declining.  Though filmed in Fox's ugly Technicolour - that muddy colour that would be called 'lurid' if it didn't yearn for the respectable - there is an intelligent compositional eye, filling the landscape with dramatic and symbolic imagery.  The prologue is particularly striking - a moody young man, Robert Wagner, released from three years in prison, rejects a financial offer by brothers eager to be rid of him.  The journey he takes into the past is one of progressive decay and danger - first he is forcibly brought to the governer, in whose building gleams an imposing portrait of his father.  When he visits his father's land, with all its traces of former activity abandoned, he is shot at from a distnace by a man who turns out to be an Indian friend -- the surreal shot of a seemingly self-standing gateway in an empty plain points to the importance of this sequence, as a kind of mythical portal into another realm; when he finally enters his family home, it is a ghost house, a gothic ruin, its dereliction shrouded in shadow.  Like the films noirs with which director Huac Dmytryk made his name, the movie begins with an end; a heavy air of fatalism hangs over the subsequent long flashback.
What probably most appeals to fans is the film's (relative) political sophistication - as a backdrop to the usual Oedipal structures is a portrait of the West as it moves from a mythical plane into the modern era.  It especially highlights two problems that would blight the nation in the next century - race and advanced capitalism.  Spencer Tracy is an Irishman whose second wife is the daughter of a Cherokee chief.  He is too important a landowner to ignore, so the locals refer to her as Spanish; the wives of these friends are nevertheless terminally indisposed whenever he gives parties.  Of his four sons, the elder three from his first marriage, his favourite is the youngest, Wagner, through whose eyes the film unravels, and on whom centres the crises of race (he is a half-breed who loves a WASP whose father disapproves) and property.  The actual catastrophe of the film occurs when a copper company on Tracy's land dumps refuse in his river, poisoning his herd.  A fight at their headquarters, in part sparked by a racist comment directed at Wagner, leads to a court case, to offset the risks of which, Tracy is advised to divide the land between his sons.  The old pioneers who tamed the land have been superceded, leaving only division and hatred in their wake.
You have got to admire a Western that interweaves its themes intelligently and without sensation (although a ridiculous coda stand-off between two brothers nearly ruins the good work).  The restrained use of music and the insistence on stillness (intimating burgeoning violence) adds a maturity to the action.  The treatment of the Indians is sensitive for the time, with the relationship beween Tracy and Katy Jurado clearly signalled as a loving and positive thing.  The title indicates the film's  theme, the (1950s?) failure of authority, family and masculinity.
Still, I found the film unsatisfying.  This is partly due to miscasting - Wagner is too wooden to carry the film's moral weight; his role should have gone to the nervy, brilliant Richard Widmark, riveting as his resentful older brother who finally turns against his father's abuse.  But it is mostly due to the stodgy direction which often confuses the sombre with the plain slow.  Compared to the similarly-themed 'Gunman's Walk', 'Lance' lacks verve or true insight.",1017187200,29,4012,4.89807976366322
331820,5,6301528565,"If you love old Westerns as I do, this is a gem. Spencer Tracy plays a widowed rancher with 3 sons, who then apparently meets and marries a Native American and has another son. The older sons resent the youngest, played by Robert Wagner, seeing him as favored. That's the back story. The film starts as the youngest is being released from jail after a 3 year sentence. The film goes on in a flashback to explain what led up to this. Spencer Tracy is charming with his wife, and is the only one in this film with any expression or humanity or humor. The others' acting is pretty wooden in that old-western style-- but very much worth watching just for Tracy, and for the engrossing story.",1480896000,,687,4.417322834645669

332058,4,6301528565,"Spencer Tracy, by this point in his career, was free from his long standing contract at MGM and was a freelance, winding up at Fox where he dominates this King Lear-on-the-range story about a hard edged cattle rancher fighting environmental pollution on his land, discontent among his offspring, and not-so-subtle racism for having a Native American wife. The good son Robert Wagner pays the price for his dad's misdeeds, while Richard Widmark is the half brother who wants all for himself when the old man can't run things anymore. Great supporting cast includes Katy Jurado, Hugh O'Brien, Earl Holliman, EG Marshall and Phillip Ober. Jean Peters plays the love interest for Wagner rather unconvincingly, but the real stars of this film are Joe McDonald's excellent cinematography, this being one of the first westerns shot in the then new widescreen CinemaScope process. Music score by Leigh Harline is also stellar, stereo soundtrack gives the wide frame some depth. This is based on 1949's House of Strangers, which in itself is an excellent telling of the same story, with Edward G. Robinson in the part Tracy plays, and Richard Conte in the Wagner role, set in NYC with banking, instead of ranching, being the family business. Lance won the Oscar for best screen story in 1954, and is certainly worth watching. I would have given this five stars if it wasn't for the conventional cop-out ending.",1471737600,,1401,4.9914529914529915

Dan (Spencer Tracy) goes off half cocked when a copper mill on his property empties poisons into the water he uses and kills 40 of his cattle.  someone has to pay and youngest son (Robert Wagner) tales the fall. In the meantime, his lowdown brothers (Richard Widmark, Earl Holliman, Hugh O'Brien) have taken over the ranch and sent it south....we also have E.G. Marshall as the crappy governor.

332360,2,6301528565,Thought it would be great as Spencer Tracy is in it.  Think this was one of his obligation pictures.....His son was a mixed breed accused of something and jailed to save his father (Spencer) who is unlikeable. Estranged brothers who work ranch but hate father let half-breed-half-brother take the rap for the father (Spencer) they all hate.  Plot lacks linearity and sensibility.

332596,4,6301528565,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

When BROKEN LANCE came out in 1954 westerns were still making decent box office dollars. But studios were aware that the tried and true plotlines had to advance from the simple good guy meets bad guy for them to continue. That became apparent with several films of the decade, this one among them. The genre would hang on through the sixties when spaghetti westerns poured new blood into it but would fade out shortly after only to raise up periodically with great films but never a frequent guest at the cinema table any longer.

The story takes place in late 1800s Arizona, revolving around the Deveraux family. Young Joe (Robert Wagner) has just been released from prison, serving a three year sentence for something he didn't do. Returning home he finds the family mansion in a shambles. In flashback we find out how Joe ended up here.

Matt Deveraux (Spencer Tracy) was a hard as nails rancher having battled everyone from claim jumpers to Indians to create a homestead he could be proud of. Along the way he lost his first wife, the father of three of his sons. Taking on a second wife, a Comanche, he had another son as well, Joe. Matt never believed in making things easy and required his sons to work as hard if not harder than anyone else on the ranch. This resulted in resentment from all three (Richard Widmark, Hugh OBrien and Earl Holliman).

When a mining company pours their waste into the river killing his cattle, Matt and sons head to their camp to tell them to stop pouring the chemical into the river. When they refuse he and his sons tear down their drainage chute and sparking a possible gun battle, accusations are made against Matt by the mining company. Corrupt politicians put the word in to take down Matt and to prevent his father from facing time in jail Joe pleads guilty to the charges.

Years later Joe has now returned to claim his inheritance. Things have changed and the odds of them ending peacefully are slim. Only time will tell what will happen.

Not only does this film offer us a real western it throws in many concerns of the time into the mix. The main one of these is the racist attitudes on display here when it comes to both Joes mother and Joe who the rest consider a half-breed. Not only do his brothers hold him in distain but the rest of the town does as well. The film also brings into question the practices of the mining company, decades before environmentalist would focus the countries attention to the problems. What makes the film exceptional is that they tackle both problems using a style that provokes thought rather than protest. In so doing it makes the viewer consider the problems rather than scream in outrage.

As with nearly every single film they release, Twilight Time offers the best transfer to be found of the movies they release. The beautiful vistas of the west are on display here making those who aren't don't see them on a daily basis jealous of having the chance to do so. Extras are fairly slim but still good considering how old the movie is. Included are an isolated score track, audio commentary with actor Earl Holliman and film historian Nick Redman, a Fox Movietone Newsreel and original theatrical trailers.

If you love classic westerns then this is one that should become an addition to your shelf.",1456876800,3,3343,4.616161616161616

332757,4,6301528565,"This is the latest in, probably, a long line of classic westerns I've missed. Especially ones starring Spencer Tracy, of which I suspect there are a precious few. Tracy's role alone makes it worth a watch.

This story really hasn't aged well as the brainless racism that fuels the plot is all but gone now and without that it's really just another western, missing the level of action we've come to expect in most John Wayne adventures. The supporting cast were capable but not a lot more. Most of them ended up doing episodic television for the rest of their career.

Props are deserved for Edward Dmytryk's deft direction. Since I have no insight into what happened when the cameras were not rolling I'm going to presume that Tracy basically was left to do what he does, since he does it so well. And the rest of the cast performed at, or slightly above their pay grade. The one exception is Richard Widmark. I can't help thinking that he had just one speed. Grumpy. Or maybe even acrid. I've watched his performances nearly dismember otherwise decent films for me. There may be something about him that I don't get but his name on the credits always makes me think, ""do I REALLY want to watch this?"" Fortunately, he stayed well enough inside the lines as Ben Devereaux as to not scupper the show.

In sum, Broken Lance is worth watching for Spencer Tracy alone. And the good news is that all the rest is pretty decent so if you invest 90 minutes watching it you won't be disappointed. Especially if you love to watch Spencer Tracy.",1455580800,,1534,4.550724637681159

When 'Matt' raids a 'smelter' for contaminating the ranches water supply, youngest son 'Joe' (Robert Wagner) steps up to the
mark taking the blame and being served a prison sentence.
The divide between 'Matt' and his eldest 'Ben' (Richard Widmark) comes to a head, the argument so heated quick-tempered
'Matt' suffers a stroke.

to run the ranch his way and sell land will kill his now incapacitated father
'Joe' has been festering in prison with just one thing on his mind ...revenge.

333066,4,6301528565,"Released in 1954, Broken Lance chronicles the last days of a cattle baron (Spencer Tracy) in southern Arizona who is at odds with three of his sons, but favors the youngest, Joe (Robert Wagner); the latter being the only one born to his Indian wife (Katy Jurado). Cutie Jean Peters plays Joes love interest while Richard Widmark plays the most embittered son.

I was about halfway through Broken Lance when it dawned on me that it was essentially the story of Joseph transplanted to the Old West, even down to the protagonists name being Joe. The biggest changes have to do with the ending, but not really as a certain person gets to go to his promised land.

Everything works for a rewarding experience: The score, the authentic locations, the great cast and the complex story. However, this is far from a typical rollicking Western so don't expect the traditional staples. There are some, of course, but the plot's too original (for a Western) to be pigeonholed as standard fare. The second half, for instance, features a fairly long court sequence. Anyway, it's great to see Robert Wagner when he was only 23 (and wholly unrecognizable to my wife and me); he's excellent as the humble, likable protagonist and a good contrast to Ben (Widmark). Speaking of which, I like the way the film shows that Ben feels he's justified in behaving the way he does. He's clearly the antagonist, but he's not a one-dimensional villain; over the course of time he foolishly allowed his heart to become embittered by hostility and jealously. Lastly, Tracy is outstanding as the proud, stubborn patriarch.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in southern Arizona and studio ranches in Southern California.

Makes for good drama and shows peoples flaws when it comes to understanding cultures other then their own. Every cast member brings something to the story, so many parallels in the struggle for top dog in the family business. People can hold onto hate for a very long time and this movie shows how devastating that can be.

333149,4,6301528565,"As far as old time westerns this is definitely classic. I think the story is original and timeless. One review stated that the film was kind of slow so I was worried, however for anyone who is used to old movies and  can wait for plot development I have to say I was not at all bothered by the progression of the film. There is a scene at the beginning and then a moment when you are not sure what happened and you slowly realized you have gone backward in time. I think that fact makes it worth watching a second time because at the beginning you don't realize why everybody is so mad at Joe or why the girl who comes on scene looks like she's seen a ghost. Broken Lance  tells a sad truth about human character. We see the classic father didn't spend anytime with me/love me theme, the greedy I have to have money theme, and the racial prejudice of the time against Native Americans which is implied was worse than being a Mexican. The irascible Spencer Tracy can't understand why everybody doesn't want to work as hard as he does and he doesn't treat anyone with partiality unless it is Joe who is smart enough not to let his fathers bearlike anger make him bitter. Joe like his mother just see Spencer's anger and passion as part of who he is. There is some symbolism in that Joe or Joseph is the youngest of four and his three older brothers don't exactly have his back. If you want to explore Westerns as I did and have watched some black and whites as a kid I think you will like this technicolor western.",1396051200,,1512,4.264808362369338

333164,5,6301528565,"The awesome force of the western genre and of CinemaScope is used to the full extent in this drama.  This movie succeeds, thanks to director Edward Dmytryk, at utilizing the panorama of CinemaScope to tell an intense story, but not turning it into a shallow spectacle movie.  CinemaScope helps the internal struggles of the Devereaux family seem more intense through the landscape, which reminds you constantly that it's the Wild West and that this is ""jungle law"".  Spencer Tracy is a very unheroic character in this movie, as angry and imposing as can be, while the real hero is Robert Wagner.  I have no complaint about any of the casting.  I personally like Robert Wagner's acting in his early career (which is the only acting of him I've seen), and didn't find any of the movie to be fake or emotionally excessive, even the romantic relationship Wagner has with a perfect-looking girl, which develops quickly.  That's my way of saying I don't find any negatives about the movie.

It has no negatives for me, and has some pretty powerful positives:  I think it's the best movie flashback I've ever seen, because the story starts out with intensity between Robert Wagner and his brothers, and the flashback begins in an appropriate atmosphere when you're already intently wondering why there's this tension.  At the beginning, Robert Wagner returns to the abandoned Devereaux ranch house, and there's a spooky (moody and kind of creepy, kind of like John Ford's movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance) atmosphere as he is about to recall the past.  The later flashforward leads to an exciting climax.  I also like the movie thematically.  Spencer Tracy's character teaches you how NOT to be:  controlling and bullying.  Richard Widmark's character teaches you, by his bad example, to not seek vengeance.  Robert Wagner's character, the hero, learns to not seek vengeance for the past, which is what the title means:  a broken lance signifies nonviolence.  I like the themes of it and the gripping way the flashback is used.  It's also got two good musical motifs used effectively throughout:  one that is the movie theme (probably mostly representing the ranch and Tracy's character), and a variant of ""Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie"" depicting the romance.  And it's simply a well-told story and an exciting one, and has a happy ending.",1362528000,,2341,4.923469387755102

333179,4,6301528565,"My Villian du Jour is Matt Devereaux, as portrayed by Spencer Tracy.

In Edward Dmytryk's widescreen western, BROKEN LANCE, Devereaux, owner of a Texas spread half the size of Rhode Island, guilt manipulates his friends, punches enemies with impunity and treats three of his four adult children like dirt.

When only 40 of his 50,000 head of cattle are poisoned from a fouled stream, Devereaux confronts the manager of a copper processing operation. Negotiations quickly go awry (Matt's offer: ""get outta here!""), so he orchestrates the smelting plant's total destruction. Taken to Federal Court by the company, Matt is such a jerk on the stand that the judge holds him in contempt, but not until it's revealed that he lynched three cattle rustlers. He allows his youngest boy (and favorite son!) to take the rap for the crime and go to jail for 3 years. It shoulda been Matt sitting in the hoosegow. Lord knows, Texas might've benefited from his imprisonment.

Devereaux is laid low by illness while he's beating one of his other sons with a whip, and the viewer wants to cheer rather than feel sorry for this ogre. He soon rises from a sickbed and gallops out to stop his boys from selling land to the hated copper outfit. Along the way, Matt drops dead in the saddle, but the S.O.B. is so stubborn, his corpse keeps on riding!

Now there's a memorable bad guy.

Tracy, appearing only in flashback sequences, is a ruthless cattle baron with four sons.  The three eldest, including Richard Widmark, he treats like hired hands, favoring his youngest boy (Robert Wagner), who agrees to serve a three year jail term instead of his father.

While he is incarcerated, the other sons double-cross Tracy, which results in his death and causes Wagner to seek revenge upon his release.

Devereaux is very hard on the first three sons, but dotes on his other son and his wife. When a copper mine is found to be contaminating Devereaux's water supply, things come to a head.

The interaction between the family members seems genuine and rings true, unlike many other films. Tracy gives him usual brillant performance, and everyone else is great.

Tracy plays a despot, absolute ruler cattle baron ""making the wrong move with the wrong people,"" using his force to restrain the pollution of his cattle's stream: ""The river is on my land. You are on my land. You close this operation down.""

His first three sons (Widmark, O'Brien and Holliman) were unanimously disappointing to him... He considered them cattle thieves, treating them harshly, without mercy... Only the fourth son and the youngest one (Robert Wagner) by his present wife, a Comanche woman played by the clever, quick-witted Katy Jurado has his affection and care... The other sons looks only forward to his demise so they may take control over his cattle empire...

Tracy -- irritated and frustrated as a father -- expends excessive reasons that arouses the sensation of hate provoking avaricious rebellion, and nearly destroys his younger kid Joe...

It was interesting to follow Dmytryk's study of racial prejudice against the Indian wife of a domineering white father... Interesting to compare the rough resilience of Tracy with his character--isolated by mortal danger in ""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" a character enlightened with real feelings specially in guessing the conclusion... Somehow this is missing in Dmytryk's ""Broken Lance"" where the autocratic father seems so artificial, an unfavorable comment that can be aimed against the movie itself...

Widmark offers a fine performance as the unlikable eldest son, while Robert Wagner and Jean Peters manage the romantic interlude...

The screenplay, based on 1949s ""Home of Strangers"" wins an Oscar and the fiery-eyed Mexican star Katy Jurado was nominated for best supporting actress...

Filmed in CinemaScope and Technicolor and with great sceneries of the state of Arizona, ""Broken Lance"" remains a first-rate adult Western...",1162944000,9,1905,5.37248322147651

333193,4,6301528565,"When it's good, BROKEN LANCE (1954) is a sprawling story about the rise and fall of cattle baron Matt Devereaux (Spencer Tracy), color by DeLuxe, in Stereophonic Sound, and, most important of all, it's filmed in CinemaScope. Borrowing feuding and greedy children from King Lear and a Native American wife, and half a title, from the influential James Stewart vehicle, Broken Arrow, it's an entertaining near-classic.

  Matt Devereaux is one of those larger-than-life pioneers whose success makes him an anachronism. Parcels of his land, once simply a buffet board for his 50,000-head herd of cattle, is now being leased out to oil and mining concerns.  There was a time when men like Devereaux would string up cattle rustlers on the spot and the local marshal, assuming he was within a hundred miles and sober, was probably glad to be rid of the bother.  Back then whatever Devereaux pushed against yielded.  But the successful pioneer plants the seed of his own extinction.  The copper found on Devereaux's land need men to dig it, and men bring civilization and the rule of law.  The unfiltered waste of a copper mine dumped into a stream pollute the water and kill cattle.  Devereaux is not the type to calmly negotiate when forty of his cattle are found poisoned. Back then Devereaux's actions brought results; now they simply usher in tragedy.

  While never losing sight of Devereaux's impulsive and sometimes brutal personality, Tracy is able to give the character enough warmth to maintain the audience's sympathies.  Katy Jurado, who received an Oscar nomination as Seora Devereaux is little more than a minor satellite in the Great Man's orbit, stoic and ever-suffering.  Frankly, I thought Seora Devereaux was a pretty one-note character, one which Jurado handles well enough but not one that seems particularly memorable or Oscar-worthy.  Robert Wagner plays the pivotal role of Joe Devereaux, Matt's `half-breed' son by Seora Devereaux and clearly his favorite.  Wagner, as was his wont, is painfully stiff in a role that in abler hands would have probably would have filled out the tragic qualities of the story.  The other three sons from Matt's first marriage are played by Richard Widmark, Hugh O'Brien, and Earl Holliman.  O'Brien and Holliman aren't much more than set dressing (although Holliman would have been a better choice, a much better choice, to play Joe).  Widmark, as the resentful, scheming and devious elder son ably holds his own with Tracy, and their scenes together are high points of a movie that at times dips perilously close to melodrama.

  The print is in very good condition and the dvd includes the full-screen and widescreen versions of this movie.  Watch the widescreen version.  Cinematographer Joe MacDonald painted a beautiful movie and director Edward Dmytryk makes use of the whole screen, favoring long, unbroken scenes uninterrupted by close-up or cuts to reaction shots.  Just two actors moving through space and working a scene.  When it's Tracy and Spencer squaring off, it's a joy to behold.  Strong recommendation, especially for fans of traditional, large scale westerns.",1120608000,22,3130,5.122287968441815
333194,5,6301528565,"This has been one of my favorite movies for over twenty five years.  Scene after scene, there's something to watch for.  What I've always loved about this movie is the great, wrenching dialogue.  And watching a young Robert Wagner isn't too difficult either.

But now, on DVD, I feel as though I am seeing the movie for the first time (or at least the second time!)  The quality of this DVD is impressive.  I also own a DVD version from a few years back that came from China, with Chinese subtitles.  Comparing the two on my 55"" tv is like comparing a digital picture taken with a 2 megapixel camera to a digital picture taken with a 12 megapixel camera.  The quality of this Twentieth Century Fox DVD is outstanding for such an old movie.  The picture is very clear, the color saturation is deep and rich, the sound is great.  I've noticed nuances about the picture, and the background scenery, that I never noticed before.

This edition also features both a widescreen and a full frame version of the movie, on a double sided disc.  I don't think there were any special features,aside from the original trailer, but I am happy to have this excellent version of my favorite old film.",1117152000,28,1184,4.533018867924528

7812141,4,6301528565,"The title ""Broken Lance"" refers to the Indian custom, according to the film, to place a lance to indicate a promise to attack or kill someone, but to break the lance to indicate that there will be peace.
The story in this film is about a man who came west very poor, but was now extremely rich. He wife died shortly after his arrival leaving him three boys to raise alone. He is a harsh man and lorded over his sons. He forced them to work for him and gave them small wages. They resented his behavior. They also resented him marrying as a second wife an Indian princess whom he adored. They had a son together whom he treated better than the three prior sons. Nevertheless, he deeded over his vast property to his four sons.
He got into trouble and lost a court case. There was a chance that no one would go to jail if a large fine was paid. The three sons who owned 3/4 of the property refused and the fourth son went to jail for three years. He is released and he is angry for having the serve three years in jail and for the older three sons so aggravating their father that he died. The film describes the details of the former summary and tells what happens next.",1482364800,,1169,4.2
