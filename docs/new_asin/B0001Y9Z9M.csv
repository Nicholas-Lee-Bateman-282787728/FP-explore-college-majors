2043292,5,B0001Y9Z9M,"The second season was different than the first and, despite that I much like Stephen Grief over Brian Croucher's interpretation of Travis (hey, that makes me a fan) Series B has it's strengths:

1. 'Shadow' written by Script Editor Chris Boucher. A break from the Terry Nation mold.

2. The emergence of Jaqueline Pearce as a truly bad...gal? She starts down the road of personifiying her bad-a$$ self. And she looks *FINE* doing it!!

3. The story arc that starts with 'Gambit' and ends with 'Star One'

I just like ALL 4 series of this classic. It is one of the unsung heroes of British Sci-Fi",1141776000,15,595,4.584905660377358

8018338,4,B0001Y9Z9M,"How much did I like this series? I bought this version with German (??) subtitles. Would have been nice that everything had been in English. I am so sorry I wasn't aware of this series  before hearing about  it from friends at science fiction conventions. Introduce your friends and tell them don't expect great production values, but great stories and acting. Thank goodness I had just bought an all-zone Blu-ray player. Sadly not available in U.S. format.",1453248000,,457,4.922077922077922

8018342,4,B0001Y9Z9M,This is a very good quality DVD and package from the classic hit series and has been remastered too. A bonus for B7 fans. Reasonable price.,1385424000,,139,4.384615384615385
8018343,5,B0001Y9Z9M,"I loved the old Blake's 7 show, but didn't have the time to spare to record it; I had only one VHS recorder and it was occupied recording Dr. Who episodes. So when Amazon offered Season One and Season Two for Region 2, I quickly bought a low-cost region-neutral DVD player and these two DVDs. I am SO GLAD I did! These are excellent episodes! However, I have to say that I cannot recommend buying the subsequent seasons of Blakes 7: the scriptwriting quality began to go downhill in the last two episodes of Season Two and only got worse in the next years. Trust me: I'll watch just about ANY SciFi movie, or serial, but Season Three and onward were stinko!!! Really disappointing. Save your money and just remember this classic SciFi series when it was at its best.",1383436800,,766,4.478571428571429
8018344,5,B0001Y9Z9M,The DVD arrived promptly and in pristine condition.  My husband loves it!  It does require a region-free player in the US.,1357603200,,122,4.761904761904762
8018345,5,B0001Y9Z9M,"The second series sees the addition of Orac, Ensor's cantankerous super computer which is much of a help as it is a hinderance. The usual friction among the crew continues unabated, as Blake and Avon fight over policy direction and Blake is determined to strike at the very heart of the Federation itself. The series' episodes seem to flop back and forth between self-preservation, doing what's right and knocking down the empire.

The crew are torn between following Blake blindly leading to suicidal raids on Federation facilities or following Avon whose main motivation is wealth and staying alive. It's a wonderful dichotomous relationship which is frequently born out in public and private spats between Blake and Avon. Avon: ""Imagine you are standing on the edge of a cliff."" Blake: ""As long as you're not standing behind me.""

Series two seems to mature a lot. The actors seem to gel as a group and the Liberator's superior speed and fire-power keeps them mostly out of harm's way. A lot of fun episodes and plenty of character development...",1306972800,,1049,4.954545454545454
8018346,5,B0001Y9Z9M,"The series is excellent, and the reviewer who wrote ""It's a scam"" simply failed to note that the DVD is clearly labeled ""PAL"" and ""Region 2.""  True, it will not play on standard U.S. DVD players -- but that's exactly what the description says.  I purchased this set for an academic library that does have a Region-2 DVD player, and the video quality is very good.",1152403200,5,363,4.484848484848484
