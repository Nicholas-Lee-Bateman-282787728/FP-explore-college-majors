8097544,4,B000CCQ9WO,"This is a beautifully filmed and acted movie.  If you are into camera work, you'll be amazed by the filming technique.  The acting is first rate, seeming as it does, to be completely natural and without affectation.  Yet, as the movie unfolds, the viewer recognizes that these performances are not simply spontaneous, but hewing to a story line that delights with its many twists and turns.  And it's all happening on the streets oF St. Petersburg, the justly fabled fabled Russian city.",1405814400,,487,4.902439024390244
8097545,4,B000CCQ9WO,"There are artworks depicting strange situations by quite intriguesque way.

On bright sunshine midday in busy Nevskiy Prospect, a Times Square of Russian St. Petersburg, a male in his twenties has approached a nice-shaped modestly-clad opposite sex walker to make a friend as on-a-street-approaching was still common in modern Eastern Europe.

A further development occurs on a city's historical sightseeing landscape, culminating when his best friend and a boyfriend of a beautiful female stranger became involved in.

Moral: not males only are sex-fantasy obsessed, and not all females are loyal to a groom-of-the-day only.

A nice psycho movie collapses in an unexpected end.",1210204800,2,678,5.553398058252427
8097546,4,B000CCQ9WO,"This film takes place in one day as three young people stroll around the city of St. Petersburg and share personal dreams and lies and develops into an anti-climax of the mystery of human drama.

On the surface, there can be many complaints about this film, the first being a distorted chronotope.  While it is true that the weather changes suddenly in St. Petersburg, the characters turn a corner and all of a sudden it is nighttime.  Most of the action occurs in realtime, so in order to actually make the passage of time into a full day, compensations had to made to the true quality of the realtime experiment.  Secondly, the subtitled translation is awkward and slow.  The characters speak extremely quickly and sometimes subtitles carry over into the next characters' dialogue, and it is often unclear to know who is saying what.  Other times, entire lines are omitted from the subtitled version.  Thirdly, it seems impossible that this movie could have been scripted, as a result, the conversation is sometimes dull and trite, but unfortunately, conversation is the only truly reliable character present.  And I can't say with any confidence the degree of interest this movie will have for a purely Western viewer, one without any ties to Russia or any interest in modern Russia.

The characters are interesting and surprisingly well-developed for the general surface transparency of the film.  For them St. Petersburg holds all aspects in the rich wealth of existence.  The other cast of characters consisting of other Petersburgers, locals and tourists, add to the immense depth in this portrait of the city.  Workers complain about the fact that the city was built on water, women and men bicker about inane details, the masses swarm and route for a soccer team that rarely wins, and the characters find themselves enmeshed in all of it, thus making it not only a personal but also broadly cultural portrait.

But overall the city is depicted in positive terms, if you can say that any attention is paid to it.  From literature, we usually see the image of the city as a character in itself--powerful, vengeful, beautifully incomprehensible.  But here, the young characters sweep past her imposing crowds and through her obtrusive landmarks without any true interest in historical or cultural matters.  But it's impossible not to feel dizzy with sensory overload as the characters swirl to the top of St. Isaac's Cathedral and look over the city.  There's something amazing and inexplicable underlying everything.

[EXTRA INFO: For anyone familiar with Russian Ark--a 90 minute, one-take tour through 300 years of Russian history via The Hermitage--this film is sort of a sarcastic spit in the face of director Sokorov, the serious Petersburg intellectual (stereo)type.  The director of this film is not from Petersburg, and maybe therefore the perspective is suprisingly fresh and not so ""heavy"".]",1182124800,2,2908,5.071428571428571
