8620089,5,B00G1N1W9I,"There is so little information in English out there on bojagi. So unless you could travel to Korea and spend months or even years there learning this amazing craft you were out of luck until now. Young-Min has brought bojagi to you.

 The DVD is broken down into 6 sections:
 1. Introduction and History of Bojagi
 2. Supplies
 3. Basic Stitches
 4. Seam Techniques
 5. Projects - Young-Min's demonstrates how to create three bojagi projects
 6. Conclusion

 The DVD is 2 hours long and covers everything you need to get started. I really loved learning more about the history of bojagi and I loved seeing all the samples of bojagi Young-Min presented. The camera work is also phenomenal and from my experience working on The Carol Duvall Show, I know how difficult it can be to get those close-up shots. Young-Min is very thorough and covers every step needed to insure success.

 Even if you weren't necessarily interested in doing bojagi, it is a fascinating look at a piece of Korean culture. You won't be disappointed.",1384560000,3,1023,4.75
