It's perfect for one to four-year-olds; the movie teaches by asking simple questions and kids answer along with the kids in the Snapatoonies train. The simple animation keeps the focus on the shape and color, as well as presenting the key words in speaking and writing. The kids on the train are a diverse group of boys and girls and make the kids watching the movie feel like they are hanging out with friends.",1329696000,,489,4.632183908045977
8499530,5,B005C1MMTE,"A brilliant way to teach your child colors...and a host of other things as well!
I found this DVD really helpful because my toddler was really struggling with colors and I needed every possible tool to re-enforce the concept to him. It's interesting how, in the DVD, the character, the Magical Color Caller takes the child through a variety of colors pointing out various things that you might find of the same color. What I also found really helpful was the repetition...after having done two colors, the color caller shows things that have both of the colors so that the concept is re-enforced in the children's minds.
What is also great is that while teaching colors, the DVD also introduces other concepts such as shapes and letters, and as a child's brain never stops absorbing things, I am sure he is taking them in as well.",1329609600,,830,4.691780821917808
8499531,5,B005C1MMTE,"Snapatoonies Magical Color Caller is another great addition to my toddler's DVD library.  The perfect way to reinforce the color and shape concepts parents are teaching their children with engaging technology.  As the developing toddler brain gets ready to begin to speak, this video offers simple, important words to learn.  The animation is simple and slow moving so that the young developing mind is not overwhelmed and can focus on the content.  The color caller is a friendly and relatable character and the train full of children will have your child feeling like he or she is hanging out with friends.  The characters are constantly conversing with the viewer so that my child is interacting throughout the episode.  The repetition and familiar animal and nature visual cues further strengthen the learning opportunity.  With a video kids will love and want to watch repeatedly combined with an educational value parents will appreciate, this is a must own.",1329523200,,964,5.141025641025641
