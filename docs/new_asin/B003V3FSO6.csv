4207807,4,B003V3FSO6,"If you like dramas that pack an emotional punch, don't miss this one. AMISH GRACE is a powerful story -- both tragic and inspiring.  The acting, screenplay & directing are excellent and, in my opinion, as good or better than in many major film productions. The story is set in the Amish community in Lancaster County, the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country.

Kimberly Williams-Paisley & Tammy Blanchard give strong performances as bereaved women who struggle mightily to cope with their own personal tragedies.  Williams-Paisley portrays the grief-stricken Amish mother of a 14-year old daughter who is gunned down by a deranged shooter in a small Amish schoolhouse.  Blanchard plays the role of the wife of the killer who discovers too late her husband's heinous plot.

Although the film is based on an incident that occurred in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania a few years ago, it is not a docudrama. Rather it focuses more on the tragic and traumatic effects of the killings on one of the Amish families and on the family (mostly the wife) of the shooter. The interplay of the 2 main characters and their contrasting families illustrate one of the major themes of the film, the profound, paradoxical impact of forgiveness.

The Amish family itself is divided in its efforts to cope with the outrageous killing of one of their daughters.  Williams-Paisley convincingly portrays the intense gamut of emotions, such as grief, hatred and outrage that any mother would feel. Her reactions sharply conflict with those of her husband, who anguishes (mostly in private) over his own suffering and the extraordinary effort required to genuinely forgive the killer in Christ-like fashion.

The other family (referred to by the Amish as the ""English,"" a term referring to those outside of their faith community) experiences the shock, shame and blame for the despicable killings while trying to comprehend the actions and loss of their seemingly normal husband and father. Blanchard shines in her role as the grieving, shame-filled wife, mother and daughter-in-law.

All of these strands of the story mesh gracefully to provide a thought-provoking drama that is neither blatantly preachy nor overly simplistic as it deals with complex moral and social issues.",1286928000,36,2250,5.176308539944904
4207808,5,B003V3FSO6,"My wife and I watched this movie the week it was released. The movie is about true events which occured in an Amish community several years ago and was reported by the national media. The movie brings the people and event to life more than a news story ever did. It gives each of us a challenge from God behind the scenes to put into place in everyday living. A tragic shooting takes place at their school and the Amish forgive the murderer and assist his family. One parent struggles with the premise of forgiveness among all the Amish, her journey is shown and how God works a miracle in her life.

The movie is a great reminder to forgive others. In case the shooting scene worries you, it is not shown. It is handled dimplomatically.",1286150400,13,737,4.419117647058823
4207809,5,B003V3FSO6,"A powerful depiction of a stricken community that taught the world about faith. Reporters raced to Nickel Mines in 2006 to cover an Amish schoolroom slaughter. What they found, unique grace and forgiveness, taught the world a lesson. This rural Amish community moved hearts world-wide, pointed to God, and forgave in a way many had never heard about. It was a powerful story then, and is just as emotional and heart-wrenching in the DVD depiction. It is an inspirational lesson in grace and forgiveness, even though it did not eliminate the Amish grief. Real people, a real story, a real way of life.

Ida (Kimberly Williams-Paisley), mother of a murdered child, struggles with her own Amish faith through the ordeal. But even she learns, from the courage of her child, forgiveness is essential and she says, ""I can do no less."" Jill Green (Fay Masterson), is a TV-reporter caught up in getting the story plus her own education about grace. Tammy Blanchard plays the wife of the killer. Matt Letcher is Gideon, Ida's Amish husband and one of the first to offer Amish Grace.

I remember the days the real Nickel Mines story rolled across the TV and covered the front page of every newspaper. It sickened your heart and brought men to tears. This DVD is so well done, beautifully filmed, with excellent music, that the emotion returns, even for those of us who watched and remember. This is a realistic depiction of the Amish community. I live in an area of Indiana Amish, little different than those at Nickel Mines, and can attest that the presentation is very authentic.

I also have read the book ""Amish Grace"" (excellent, buy it) & listened to one of the book's 3 authors talk about the good Amish people. ""Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy"" is by Donald B. Kraybill, Steven M. Nolt, and David L. Weaver-Zercher; all experts in the life, history, and faith of the Amish. The DVD was expertly created from the facts and history provided in the book by these 3 men. This story is not Hollywood, it is reality, and the godly people of the event are honestly depicted.

The DVD does have SUBTITLES. It is unrated, but would pass for PG or G, in my opinion, at least teenage and older. This is a MUST VIEW. I am so glad I OWN it, and can share it with friends.

It will remind viewers, like me, that life is too short to hate. Amish Grace. If they can do it; ""I can do no less.""",1285113600,8,2391,4.577102803738318
4207810,5,B003V3FSO6,"Based on the true story of the murder of five innocent Amish school girls in 2006 in Lancaster County Pennsylvania. The main family in the story is fictional, however. Great acting and screenplay.  Emotional without being manipulative. Violent without showing any violence. Inspirational without being preachy. I have always been critical of faith-based films that are basically 'sermons disguised as films'. Faith-based films should be great stories where the message is an integral part of the story. This is one of those. At the heart of the story is a horrific crime. A lone gunman backs his pickup to a one room Amish school, walks in and proceeds to kill five young Amish girls and wound five others.  What happens after that is almost as unbelievable. Three Amish men, including the father of one of the victims, visit the home of the killer to offer forgiveness and help to the gunman's widow. But not everyone finds it easy to forgive.  Ida Graber (Paisley) isn't buying it. 'I will not betray my daughter by forgiving her killer'.  What follows is for the most part the struggle between two women, both mothers & wives, struggling with forgiveness and their husbands from two totally different perspectives. While we may all have a tendency to see the Amish as stoic and and almost mechanical or robotic in their faith, this is not at all what comes thru in the film. While raising (but not answering) some inconsistencies in their practices, we see them as real humans struggling to deal with this horrific crime against their community. One of the most powerful scenes is at the funeral for the gunman. This is a movie that will haunt you and stick with you as you consider (at least I did) how to live out a live of forgiving with even just the most mundane grievances. What could this mean for communities, our nation and our world if forgiveness were truly practiced.  I highly recommend this film. Lu G. for Lu's Reviews.",1284768000,17,1937,4.7701492537313435
4207811,5,B003V3FSO6,"It's a story that appeared in the news for a couple of days a few years ago, then it was quickly forgotten by the majority of people--even serious news watchers like myself.

A lone milkman with a gun entered a one-room Amish schoolhouse and killed a teacher and number of children, then himself. Here's a link to the story in the New York Times: [...]

While the incident itself was horrible, what is also forgotten is the response of the Amish to forgive the wife and family of the gunman. That story is told from the viewpoint of a mother (played by Kimberly Williams-Paisley) in a family where their oldest daughter was killed. She struggles with the response of her husband and the other Amish leaders to forgive.

It's easy to get caught up in this well-told story and drama but you should be forewarned to get ready. The message of forgiveness will strike a deep chord. I recommend it.",1284249600,5,892,4.5625

offended in any way!  It is a command from God himself & right here proved how the Amish put God first
in their life even when someone murders their little children!!  Wow...only with the help of God could

4207870,5,B003V3FSO6,"I wish I could give this film four and a half stars, but since that isn't an option, I shall round up and give it the full five star rating.  This movie is based on a true story that made the national media.  As a lone gunman, without any rational explanation, who was well known in the Amish community in spite of him being an ""Englisher"" , with a full arsenal of weaponry walked in to a school building, let out all of the boys and started killing the girls.  Five of the young Amish girls were killed and five more wounded.  It was a totally evil and insane thing for him to do, but the Amish community in their religious fashion, promptly went to the killer's wife and offered their forgiveness and aid.  Their pure motives being a surprise to both the killer's wife and the local media.  And this movie explores the feelings of the mother of Mary Beth, who was one of the girls killed.  As her husband is one of the ones quick to forgive and she feels it is a slight to her daughter's memory.  After all, she is forbidden to speak to her own sister who is shunned for marrying an English man, but yet her Amish community expects her to forgive this killer . . . just like that?  The many facets of forgiveness are thus explored throughout the film, as well as parts of the grieving process.  In the end, we feel the power of forgiveness and the beauty of the Amish community.  The main flaw that I saw in the film, though, was that the actors portraying the Amish did not at all convey through their expressions or personalities anything that felt truly Amish.  They seemed modern day flippant in their behavior.  In Beverly Lewis' ""The Confession"" the actors felt Amish, but these did not.  As they had no accents, and given that one of the girls in the school house who escaped, did so because she didn't understand English, only Pennsylvania Dutch, accents would be called for in this occasion to lend authenticity to the story.",1457136000,,1936,4.401685393258427

One of the many aspects of this movie that I like, is that they make the process of forgiveness realistic. Forgiveness is not easy, but it is a choice and a painful journey. It is not something one can simply get over. But when forgiveness can finally find it's way past the bitterness and into one's heart, it brings such a peace and joy as one would never have dreamed of! Forgiveness takes courage, it is not passive. I also appreciate that the makers of this movie were respectful towards the victims of the shooting by not including the violent scene where the murder takes place.

I am not a religious person, although a very firm believer in God and faith. It left me with an overwhelming calmness with regard to my own decision as to whether forgiveness was possible for me.

The movie deals with how Amish individuals (families of the victims) deal with the murders.  Forgiveness is the theme of the movie.  It also portrays the family of the shooter as victims in need, too.  It is an emotionally involving movie, but it is not bloody and the actual shooting is not shown.  You will come away better understanding how to deal with challenges in your life.  You won't regret seeing this movie.

It is based on where that guy went into the Amish school and shot the children.  And this movie goes into great detail on how the Amish families handled the loss of their children and their great forgiveness. But the focus is on one family in particular because the mother could NOT forgive.  What she went through as a parent in trying to find forgiveness, meaning and release from her anger keeps you on the edge of your chair in what will happen next.  I kept thinking that I could not forgive either.  But near the end, you are understanding the pain the killer's family is going through also.  And then I was thinking that I HOPE I could be just like the Amish in how they came to grips, understanding, forgiveness all by focusing on their Lord.  Beautiful, Beautiful Movie!

I appreciated the way the shooting event was portrayed (no video or audio of the violence), even though I thought this would certainly take something away from the impact.  It did not take away, but enhanced everything, insisting we ""get"" the message and not just the violence of this tragic event!  The message came through in every aspect of the dialog, characters and the unfolding of what transpired.  Whether or not it held exactly to the truth did not matter to me, as the movie was made to convey a profound message.  In fact, I thought the way it was presented was absolutely compelling and provided the greatest impact I could have imagined.  Magnificent acting from entire cast -- but particularly Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Tammy Blanchard.

This is a message for everyone, no matter what religion, and including those with no religion.  The character, Gideon, explains so perfectly why forgiveness is necessary for us to function fully as human beings.

These people are slaves to religion and totally ignore God with many of their rules and practices.

Watch the movie and enjoy it, but keep in mind that these people are a lost people group that need Jesus just like the rest of us.

Its beauty shines in the portrayal of the manner in which these challenging events are handled by the impacted community.  In the telling of the story, there is an invitation for the viewer to consider how there is room to ""step up"" to another level of living life... a move that is empowering, respectful and loving to all concerned.  There is space to consider how we are connected to one another, not so much as separate beings but as companions and co-journeyers in this thing called life.

The Amish truly walk their talk in this gripping tragedy .  Perhaps a little syrupy for some but the overall impact is powerful.  It's the story that gets into one's heart.

I have a great love for my Anabaptist brothers, as well as a very tender heart in general. This movie lightened my Kleenex box in a hurry, but in a good,cleansing sort of way.  If you are one who likes to soften your heart by crying over movies, this one is a must for you.  I am touched by the message of Christian forgiveness, but this movie also strikes a chord in my heart in its depiction of the barriers breaking down between Amish Christians and the wife of the shooter (Amy), who was clearly also a Christian. That is what truly touched me. Regenerate hearts should be able to find common ground regardless of differences in culture, and that was presented well here. There were moments that were cringe-worthy with respect to realism, showing that clearly, there were no Amish or Mennonite film consultants on hand (which would go without saying).  For example, when the Amish come to visit the shooters wife (Amy) for the first time, and she (although Christian) says that she ""swears to God"", the Amish actors don't seem to notice this when, in fact, they would wince if someone were to use that language.  In fact, most evangelical/Biblical Christians would not use that language.  Also, when Ida's husband uses the term ""lucky"" in his one of his speeches, I had to chuckle.  You most likely would not ever here plain people use that term(I know I haven't).  The actress portraying Ida was a good actress, but her mannerisms were completely un-plain. I have seen plain women act as she does (though not many),but only when attempting to do so to imitate people of the world. Having said all that, ultimately this film is worth seeing, and I would cheerfully recommend it. It doesn't teach you much about the Amish, but it teaches a whole lot about the Christian heart!",1380326400,,1955,4.682215743440233

4208025,5,B003V3FSO6,The contents of this movie is wholesome that it does not use bad language or nude scenes.  There is a senseless violent act committed against the innocent that brings redeeming qualities to the forefront as folks learn how to deal/cope with their losses and find forgiveness and how far it reaches out to those in need; particularly the family members of the perpetrator.

4208029,5,B003V3FSO6,I rate from a 0 to 10 box tissue award with 10 being a real tear jerker movie.  This movie is exceptional and shows the grace of forgiveness we as Christians should all posses.  I bought two and will buy more as gifts.  You cannot have forgiveness unless there is reconciliation and both have to be from the heart as Jesus took our sins and reconciled us to the Father.  This is a true story of parents who lost children and showed Mathew 6:14-15 which God commands.  Unfortunately in the Christian circles in many church's the so-called-Christians are the only ones who shoots its wounded which is not what God commanded.  If you have unforgiveness in your heart this movie maybe difficult for you to watch knowing that it is not a fictional movie.  I would hope and pray that this movie would start a movement across the nation to show what true forgiveness is.  At the end of the movie look how many of the shooters church congregation attended his funeral it will amaze you but the numbers are very accurate to church's across America.

I didn't realize that this was based on a true story, and it was almost hard to watch their pain in parts of it.  If one ever wondered about their faith, this shows you not too.  The world would be a better place if we all practiced to be more like the Amish.  I would recommend this movie to anyone but probably not for children under 10 years of age.  At least view it first alone then make up your mind if your children should see it.",1360281600,,547,4.211538461538462

4208032,3,B003V3FSO6,"I bought this movie on Amazon instant video.  The good thing about instant video is that you don't have to worry about your disc being scratched or damaged, or it being lost.  You'll always have access to it (unless Amazon goes out of business or something like that, which I don't anticipate, at least not anytime soon).  The only bad thing about video streaming (on Amazon anyway) is that you don't have any of the disc options.  There is no subtitle option, no bonus features, you just get the movie.  I suppose it's not a big deal for a made-for-TV movie like this; but what about the collectibles?  Like the I Love Lucy discs - I mean, you can stream the episodes, but you wouldn't be able to access the extra bonus materials that people crave for classics like Lucy... anyway, I digress.

Okay, the movie itself was kind of cheesy.  I cried anyway, but the only reason why I cried was because of the thought of those little girls being killed - and I knew that it was based on actual events, so I had already read up on the shooting and seen the news footage of it prior to this movie, so it was already an emotional topic for me anyway.  The tears had nothing to do with good acting.  The reason why I say that this movie is ""cheesy"" is because no one really embraced their roles.  I had the feeling that this movie was thrown together in about a week or so.  For example, no one had an Amish accent - now, I don't know if anyone has ever been in Lancaster County, PA - but even if you haven't, and you've had contact with other Amish people in other areas (like the Midwest for example), you know that they speak with a heavy accent.  They also speak Pennsylvania German (also called PA Dutch), English is a second language to them.  I mean, these actors didn't even attempt to fake an Amish accent, except for Ida here and there - and it wasn't very good faking either.

That was my main problem with this movie, it didn't seem authentic, mainly what was lacking was the accents.",1358985600,,1988,4.335135135135135

The movie is done well and makes real the human anguish involved in this unimaginable tragedy.  However well intended, to the choice of the Amish church leadership (following this crisis) to accept the ""Amish Mafia"" as a means to reconcile justice for their community on earth is to accept and engage the world's methods-not those of Jesus.

However, I thought by far the shining star of this one was Tammy Blanchard. Firstly, credit to the the writers for a stroke of genious when they decided to incorporate the easily-overlooked story of a mother suddenly turned widow and left alone to bear the burden, guilt, and pain, of the horrific thing her husband did. It was Ms. Blanchard's amazing and poweful portrayal of the woman's pain, shame, and anger that brought tears to my eyes. In her performance, amidst all the pain that Ms. Blanchard makes so real to the audience was also an amazing courage in how she faced the families of her husband's victims. All in all, Ms. Blanchard's perfomance was worthy of high-praise indeed.

A great movie for anyone who enjoys dramas, faith, based films, or Lifetime-style flicks.",1346198400,,1000,4.946428571428571

The tragic story is real today and happening in schools all over the US. This is a true story and really happened just like it says.

It was very well done, nothing graphic but definitely let you know a terrible tragedy had occurred. If you are a Christian think you got it going on you might want to check up on yourself with this one. I will make most Christians ashamed of themselves when they see the true Spirit of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ working through these precious Amish Brothers and Sisters.

4208055,5,B003V3FSO6,"I loved this factual show about the shooting of the 10-girls in the Amish community in 2006. The most amazing part of the whole story is the showing of the struggle int he heart of the young Amish mother portrayed by Kimberly Williams-Paisley. I think this is truly a show that should be shown over and over as a remarkable story of acceptance and forgiveness. *Spoiler* I especially was moved by the fact the wife of the shooter, who belonged to a large congregation was very much alone at the funeral of he husband--until the Amish came to show their support.

The poor woman was devastated that he did such a horrible thing and it was wonderful how they reached out to her.  It was also about a woman who struggled with anger and almost gave up on her faith.  In the end, she forgave the man who killed her daugther.  It was an awesome movie.",1318896000,,421,4.148148148148148
4208058,5,B003V3FSO6,"This is an incredible real life story about forgiveness. As Christians we know we must forgive, but forgiving someone for killing someone you love is quite another challenge. This movie is beautiful because it also shows how healing forgiving can be, not only for ourselves, but for the ones we forgive. Well acted, a movie I keep in my house and take out to remind myself how important forgiving is and how small the things God asks me to forgive compared to what others have to forgive.",1315872000,,488,4.620689655172414
4208059,5,B003V3FSO6,"This story is based on the true story of a man who murdered several Amish school girls before taking his own life. The presentation of the story would be straight PG -- the killing is done off camera. (There's a book by the same title -- the movie can be based on the movie, but I saw nothing in the pages that connected the two even though it is the same name and the same story.)

This movie raises very key points on forgiveness. Some people feel this has been a little too fictionalized, but I think you may lose something by not suspending any unbelief.

This movie would be great for parents to watch with their children (especially grade school age children) and discuss it with them. (I would not show it unsupervised). I also would consider this great for a church group for a special meeting, provided they give an hour and a half for the movie and then time for group discussion.",1315612800,,890,4.387878787878788
4208060,5,B003V3FSO6,"This film is about the aftermath of the shooting at an Amish school in 2006. which left five children dead.  It's also about how one religious community struggled to obey the command of Jesus to forgive those who wrong us.

In a deeper sense, however, it explores exactly what forgiveness is.  The Amish realize something that most of us don't.  They know that harboring hatred and anger in our hearts hurts no one but ourselves.  This is a truth that spiritual leaders through the millennia have spoken of, yet it is also one that is generally ignored among people of faith.  We long for God to strike out and destroy those we call sinners, while we forget that the vitriol we display in doing so ultimately poisons our own souls.

I was so impressed with this movie that I bought a copy to screen at our church in September.  I look forward to a fruitful discussion afterward.  I recommend this touching film for anyone who has ever struggled with unforgiveness.",1314662400,,964,4.623529411764705

To me this movie and the book are wonderful because they show a type of forgiveness that I do not believe any of us are capable of doing.

The live with a solid and unbreakable faith in God's words has lead the Amish to forgive the one who has murdered their innocent children!

why?
As said in another review, the ""Amish"" in this film are absolutely nothing like real Amish.  We've known Amish families for many years and they are nothing like what this film represents.
It is misleading at best.

4208074,5,B003V3FSO6,"In a time when self-love rules the day, this film demonstrates the power of true, biblical forgiveness.  The Bible doesn't teach us that a person has to earn forgiveness, or that they even have to ask for it.  We should give forgiveness because Christ forgave us, and that is the primary reason.  It's easy for anyone to explain these truths - but these people LIVED IT.

4208076,5,B003V3FSO6,"I wasn't sure I wanted to watch Amish Grace when it first came out because of all the violence in the story. I finally bought it and recently watched it.  I was surpirsed and pleased by the equality of the filming, and the telling of the story.  They were careful to not exploit the Amish people involved but also gave us an inside look at their lifestyle and how they responded to this horrific event.  The story was told without showing the actual shooting, or the inside of the school when it was over. Nor did they show any blood or dead bodies.  Very tastefully done.  Characters were believeable and before I knew it, I was crying over the depth of emotion displayed when they went to the wife of the shooter and expressed their concern for her and her family, and forgave her husband for what he had done.
I highly recommend this movie for those who are interested in learning the story, and how real people can offer forgiveness and grace when it seems an impossible thing to do.  You'll need a handful of tissue.",1297382400,2,1021,4.433155080213904
4208077,5,B003V3FSO6,"This film lets you know at the beginning that it is BASED on a true story but that the particular family featured is FICTITIOUS. I appreciate that because it is true that the Amish would not respond the way the film portrays re. the main character and the reporter. Instead it probably helped the message of real forgiveness to get across to more people. That message is clearly represented and the way the characters resolve the issue is explained very well. Forgiveness is indeed something that needs to be given over and over again - for the same offense. (This is made clear nearer the end of the film.) One doesn't just ""forgive and forget."" That's impossible. It is only through the life of the Lord in a person that one can forgive. All of my family both enjoyed and appreciated this film.",1295049600,5,796,4.573426573426573

4208079,5,B003V3FSO6,"The Amish have a way about them where Faith is concerned.

4208080,3,B003V3FSO6,"The message of forgiveness is presented well, even eloquently at times, in this film. The unforgiving wife's husband, Gideon, is the most believable of all the actors and it is his words about forgiveness that make the film worth viewing.

However, living among the Amish as I do, and having been in an Amish home, I found it hard to get past the unrealistic acting and scenery. The actors, especially the fictional main character, were so American English, that I had to work to get past their presentation to grasp the real message. The house of the Amish family in this film was a far stretch from the simple, plain homes with the smell of wood burning that are true Amish. Who came up with the idea of the fancy boots on the girls in the beginning of the movie? Knowing real Amish, I cannot imagine them ever sporting such fancy things.

I am interested to read a book on this event now. I hope to find one that doesn't deal in fiction but with the Amish as I know them and admire so much.",1294876800,23,993,4.3621621621621625
4208081,5,B003V3FSO6,"Instead of repeating other reviewers, I mostly focus on unmentioned content. To begin with, the killer was no stranger. He was a milkman known to the children and parents. He was no psychopath. To the contrary: He was an ordinary family man. His daughter had died on the day she was born, and he wanted to get back at God by killing some girls. It was a premeditated act: He purchased the firearms and bullets a week before committing the crime. The killer's wife had no inkling what he was about to do, and their son thought that the killer must have been someone else, not his father.

WARNING: This movie is very emotionally intense. It does not give pat answers. Nor does it have a particularly happy ending, although it does have surprising testimony, from a girl who came out of a coma, about how the doomed girls acted in the last moments of their lives.

As news of the killing spreads, frantic parents arrive, desperately hoping that their missing children are at some hospital, not the morgue. (This is reminiscent of what happened immediately after the Our Lady of the Angels School fire of 1958). The father immediately realizes that his eldest daughter is among the fatalities when he recognizes her new boots sticking out from the covered bodies being evacuated into the morgue on stretchers.

One of the mothers, and the younger sister whose older sister perished, refuse to forgive the killer. At this time, misconceptions about forgiveness are dispelled.  (As someone who confessedly has struggled with forgiveness during his life, I found this helpful.) Forgiveness does not in any way imply a trivializing of the pain and grief of the loss. Forgiveness does not mean forgetting, nor does it diminish the gravity of the crime. Forgiveness does not cancel retributive justice. To the contrary: The killer is ""let go"" by the victims so that he may face the judgment and punishment of God. Letting go of the hate frees the person who is experiencing the hate.

Most of the media consists of secularists, and they tend to have at least a latent anti-Christian bias. This shows up in the form of journalists a priori doubting the genuineness of the forgiveness practiced by the Amish. The journalists tend to think that the Amish forgiveness was just an outward, scripted act, and their investigation begins with the expectation that this is exactly what they will find.

Finally, the movie touches upon survivor guilt. A younger sister, who had preserved her life by running out of the doomed schoolhouse, verbalizes a wish that she had been killed instead of her older sister.",1294617600,4,2591,4.837471783295711

4208087,5,B003V3FSO6,"This movie touches at the heart of one's spirituality. It is easy to talk the talk, but when it comes time to walk the walk, it is often a different story. The Bible teaches that when we pray, unless we forgive those that have trepassed against us, neither will the LORD forgive us, our trespasses.

But, if, God forbid, someone was to take the life of a loved one, how will we really cope with such a situation? For sure there will be a tremendous amount of pain, anguish and emotional turmoil.

In this picture, which is based on a true story, it shows the struggles of a mother, when one of her two daughters is killed by a disturbed man (who commits suicide after slaying 5 Amish girls).

This is not the regular fast paced CG-loaded movie, rather it rolls out the story slowly and draws you in emotionally. You begin to partake of Ida Graber's grief and sorrow. The sense of loss and helplessness comes across sincerely.

It appears to have accurately captured the Amish way of life (based on other documentaries that I have seen on Amish communities), buggys and all. The quality of the acting is superb and it will leave you thinking, and maybe we can now drop off some of those old grudges that we may have been holding on to for way too long.",1291680000,2,1251,4.402597402597403

4208091,5,B003V3FSO6,"I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much when I saw that this was a made-for-TV movie.  Fortunately, though, this film transcended its medium and proved to be an extraordinary telling of the fallout of a horrible event.  I was thoroughly impressed with the honesty, passion, and compassion shown by the directors, writers, and actors in this film.  The fact that they were able to adequately portray the horror of the event without us ever hearing even a single shot is a beautiful example of what filmmakers can do when they allow us to use our imaginations--something that most people in the industry seem to be incapable of doing.

The conflicts in the characters, from the parents of the children and the siblings and peers of the victims, to the reporter who covers the story, are very real and very well presented.  The main character, played by Kimberly Williams Paisley, gives a stellar performance as an incredibly conflicted woman who is having a very difficult time dealing not just with her daughter's death, but with the forgiveness that her husband and others are showing for an ""unforgivable"" act.  The actor who plays her husband, whose name I don't know, gives an extremely convincing performance, too.

All in all, this is a film that can bring you to tears without manipulating you--the emotions you feel are real, and the people you feel them for are real.  All through the film, I kept turning to my wife and saying, ""This is really well done.""  She would wipe away her tears and nod in agreement.",1289174400,3,1522,4.756653992395437

The shooting incident is only implied (we see the man backing up his truck to the schoolhouse then getting out with a bag and walking in.  That is all that is shown of the incident.) I was very comfortable letting my young children (8 to 10) watch this, but I think the theme of forgiveness could not be fully embraced by them. I believe we can all learn from the lessons demonstrated by the Amish after this horrific event (which I remember hearing in the news to be accurate) which is also biblical.  Believers and non-believers a like can benefit from the message of this movie. Be forewarned you will need tissues near by for the bulk of this movie.",1287792000,,916,4.539393939393939

All I could say at the end (through my tears) was, Amen.  It will stir the holy spirit within you.
One word of caution:  If you want to view this as a family and have young children please parents, watch it first and be prepared to talk your children through all the situations, emotions and questions that come up.
