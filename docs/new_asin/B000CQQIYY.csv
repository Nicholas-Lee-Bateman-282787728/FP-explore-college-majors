2470208,4,B000CQQIYY,"Quite informative for a 50 minute program, but it helps to have a little background knowledge on the subject matter.  As with other DVD's from this series, the subject is too broad to be adequately covered in that amount of time.  So topics such as the Sikh and Jain religions are not really discussed.  I found this DVD is a good reference to be used in conjunction with other sources of information.

2470209,4,B000CQQIYY,"First off, let me say that the other review is a bit off-base. Although there might be some nudity involved it has much to do with their culture and it's not vulgar. Also it doesn't say it's meant for kids or for being used as a teaching aide. besides, the teacher should have watched it first to make sure it was suitable for children as with any program. It's a great DVD that is very informative and interesting. I learned quite a few things from this program and loved seeing Anicent India via this DVD. It's something that anyone who is interested in India or learning about amazing places should pick up. GOOD STUFF!",1139443200,19,622,4.464912280701754
2470210,4,B000CQQIYY,"A beautiful documentary on ancient India.  However, I was very disappointed to see that one of the best scenes in the documentary was chopped off, that of a magnificently sculptured temple at Khajuraho dedicated to Vishny.  It may have been cut because it contains sculptures from the 10th century which some teachers may consider unsuitable for their students, what the unedited version calls ""the most magnificent temple in all of ancient India"".",1344729600,,448,5.208333333333333
2470211,4,B000CQQIYY,"Watched this film twice.  Enjoyed.
Naturally in a mere hour this documentary could not cover such an extensive history.
The six part THE STORY OF INDIA is far better but also has six hours to do it's job.
Lots of art, architecture, photos to show the history.  This is lacking in much of the southern history of the country.
Others have complained of the sexual stone reliefs shown briefly during the film.  Americans really need to get over their sex negativity.  If people hate sex so much they need to become hermits.  It's a major part of history and daily life and can't be ignored.  And it was a brief part of the film.
This was a decent film though i still recommend THE STORY OF INDIA 6 part series more.",1327190400,,712,4.396946564885496

It was extremely dry, but worse, suddenly appeared explicit sexual footage which led to parent uproars as students reported at home. Even though the scenes were high relief sculpture on an ancient building, they were totally inappropriate for students ... or adults who try to follow Gandhi's adage: ""I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.""",1307577600,4,719,6.741935483870968
2470213,1,B000CQQIYY,"Very Patchy work. The history here is spoken without any reference to the Deccan or South India. Highly confined to North India. Pandyas the longest surviving dynasties of the world, did not even have a mention. The Cholas, Pallavas and the golden age of India, where left without any mention.

Even in the history of North, not all major dynasties where covered. Probably the volume of work that could go into the DVD was the consideration, even then omissions are so glaring.

The coverage of Indus valley civilization was good.",1261872000,3,530,4.877777777777778
2470214,5,B000CQQIYY,I purchased this DVD for my English 12 class.  Have not viewed it yet.,1261180800,,70,4.0
2470215,2,B000CQQIYY,"The DVD's focus is on the northern half of Indian civilization and only mentions (5 seconds on a map) of the southern Indian civilization (Dravidian). At least it does cover Mohenjo-Daro the predecessor to the Indus Valley Civilization. Computer Graphics (CG) is well used with Mohenjo-Daro as the structures are mostly in ruins. However the CG is way over used with structures that are well intact such as the Taj-mahal, Making the documentary more of an illusion with lots of hurried talk. A far better DVD for the price is BBC - around the world in 80 days which spends a whole episode on India - Sri Lanka with actual footage.",1230508800,10,630,4.684684684684685
2470216,4,B000CQQIYY,"This video was a wonderful addition to my curriculum.  It provide solid factual information with rich, detailed photography, computer-generated imagery and stunning graphical displays.  It provided my students a much richer insight into ""Old India"" so that they could appreciate the culture in a more modern world.",1179792000,7,314,5.659574468085107
2470217,4,B000CQQIYY,This DVD tells you many things about Indias history. Without revieling the contents I would say it is worth the money. I give it 4 out of 5 because i wish it had longer chapters as I found my self wanting more. Probably the best documentary about Indian history that I have seen and great 3D re-creations.,1171756800,4,305,4.368421052631579
2470218,4,B000CQQIYY,"This 50-minute documentary is a good overview of the history of India through the 17th century, with special attention to archaeology and architecture. Topics include the Indus Valley civilization, the Aryans, the Vedic period, karma and reincarnation, the caste system, the Mauryan Empire, Ashoka and the rise of Buddhism, the Gupta Dynasty and the resurgence of Hinduism, the Rajput Empire, the rise of Islam, the Mughal Empire, and the Taj Mahal.

If you're considering using this video in the classroom or watching it with children, note that one of the architectural treasures from the Rajput Empire is a temple covered with explicitly sexual sculptures.

2470219,4,B000CQQIYY,The film covers Indian history from the Indus Valley civilization (Harappa) through the Mughals. It hits all the major points needed for a good review of Indian history prior to the AP World History exam. It is also good for discussions on change-over-time in India. The film  can also be shown in segments to reinforce instruction as you go along.,1162598400,15,348,4.8

8100782,3,B000CQQIYY,"It's a very good overview of Indian history in a short video. The title made me think it would focus more on the ancient times but it breezes through them straight into Mogul times where it dwells for the longest span. The much announced 3D animation of the ancient city is the kind of thing your kid can make in a lazy afternoon in Minecraft. Impressive for the 1980's, maybe. Not today.

It's not a bad video. Just not what it offers.",1399075200,2,436,4.317073170731708
