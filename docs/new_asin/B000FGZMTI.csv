8122469,3,B000FGZMTI,"I only give the video a 3 because on its own it is only mildy useful or entertaining. This is a support material dvd for a 5thD-X DIR course and as such is a valuable tool, when accompanied by the instructor and the rest of the course material.

On the other hand if you are just looking to get a little look into improving your diving, this demonstrates some very solid skills and technique. As mentioned these skills would only be well mastered with instruction.

Admittedly I have not Taken A DIR course but still got a kick out of this dvd and will probably buy the next one 5thD-X technical diving dvd.",1175558400,,607,4.3628318584070795
8122470,5,B000FGZMTI,"Have you thought about moving beyond your recreational dive training but would like a ""sneak peek"" into where you might be headed?  Have you progressed in your diving to where you know that the skills you were taught just don't feel right and you know in your gut there must be a better way?  This DVD is an excellent resource for you.  I also recommend the recreational video from 5thDx, too.  Andrew's videos are so good and his technique so refined that if he put out a DVD of him underwater reading his grocery list I'd buy it.",1162425600,,531,4.387755102040816
