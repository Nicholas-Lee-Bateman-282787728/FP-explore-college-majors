6674208,5,B00NP06DJE,"A trip down memory lane of nostalgic late college nights watching Adult Swim on CN. Anyway first thoughts so far about the actual quality of the Blu Ray which is what everybody really wants to know:

1) Yes it is in 4:3 ratio upscaled to 16:9 so no it is NOT full screen HD, and unless your tv has a Cinema Zoom feature or equivalent the picture is going to have the ""black bands"" on the right and left side of the picture. Even with Zoom you still are probably not going to get fullscreen HD.

Picture Quality -
2) The picture quality is actually very good and definitely has an HD resolution(quality) but just keep in mind the original picture ratio has been maintained and the picture is not ""stretched to fit 16:9"" like I said in point #1.

Sound Quality -
3) The audio is available in 5.1 English Dub or original 5.1 Japanese and I have to say that the audio quality is very impressive, again your mileage will vary but I am watching these Blu Ray through a LG tv with an Orei Digital to RCA/headphone out converter and also a ANKER Blu Ray transmitter attached paired with a pair of JBL bluetooth headphones and a home stereo system. This may sound a little complicated but my point is even using an digital audio converter and bluetooth converter, the 5.1 Audio sounds crystal clear, the actual stereo conversion sounds good and doesn't sound too low like 5.1 audio can sometimes suffer from when converted to stereo output. There is a little latency but that has nothing at all to do with the Blu Ray disc and has to do with the audio/bluetooth converter. My MAIN POINT: the audio sounds good and definitely has more detail than watching it on cable tv. Yoko Kanno's soundtrack actually sounds better in 5.1 (to me at least).

NOW THE BIG QUESTION - IS THIS COLLECTION WORTH IT?
4) I would definitely say yes - but let me give a couple of caveats. a) If you DON'T already own a DVD set of Cowboy Bebop then yes. If you have been a fan of the series for years - then yes. b) If you have never seen the series but want to know what all the hype is about - then probably yes. c) If you have watched the series before and never really got into it - then purchasing this or the collector's Blu Ray most likely won't change your mind about Cowboy Bebop but for me I still think Cowboy Bebop is one of if not the best Anime series of all time, a large part because of the music (I'm a jazz music fan and fan of Yoko Kanno's work), partly because of the humor, and largely because of its memorable characters, but everybody will have their own opinions.

Overall I would rate the Blu Ray - a buy if you are fan of the series, maybe purchase the DVD series to save money, or buy the COLLECTOR's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboy-Bebop-The-Complete-Series-Amazon-Exclusive-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00MMOZ1SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series - Amazon Exclusive Edition (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;addition (if available) if you are a hardcore Bebop fan....See you Space Cowboys.....

P.S - FAYE VALENTINE actually looks sexier in HD...just sayin'

Update 1/2/2015:
After reading many of the other reviewers and seeing their pros and cons of the Blu Ray set, and also having more time to fully experience the Blu Ray set with all of its features I have a couple of points to add that others have made in their own way as well:

1) Yes it would've of been nice to have fullscreen 16:9 HD - but keeping the view in a 4:3 ratio but enhancing the picture quality makes sense because you get the whole original picture and Cowboy Bebop unlike some other animes of its time used many different camera and zoom angles, so if they cropped the video important scene details would be cropped as well.

2) Keep in mind that the show is 16 going on 17 years old - I know its hard for us old-timers to admit we're not the young college-freshman (or senior) whippersnappers that used to stay up and watch Bebop on Adult Swim (CN) and comparing the Bebop Blu Ray to a couple of other the newer (2005 -10 + era) anime Blu Rays I own - mainly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michiko-Hatchin-Complete-Series-Part-1-Blu-ray/dp/B00DJ5IOM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michiko & Hatchin: Complete Series Part 1 [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate-Complete-Series-Classic-Blu-ray/dp/B00KU3Y5CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins Gate: Complete Series Classic [Blu-ray</a>] which both look absolutely gorgeous on a HD Tv - Bebop does show its age a little (please don't hate me) there are many scenes that look fantastic like Episode 23 (Hardluck Woman -scene w/ Faye and Ed - leaving the orphanage), Episode 20 (Pierrot Le Fou), ep. 17 Mushroom Samba, and of course the finale episodes 23 -24, but younger generation viewers who've been spoiled by everything being in HD (yeah I said it) may be a little put off by this. On the upside though even some newer release movies aren't in full (16:9) HD - case in point Godzilla (2014) which I also own.

3) Hands down the audio quality is better - the Dolby 5.1 English sounds light years (or would it be sound years) better than what you were probably used to hearing on cable! But having the option for English subtitles even when the language is set to English would've have been nice.

4) Faye Valentine still looks sexier in HD - just sayin.......

6674209,2,B00NP06DJE,"5 star show but 2 star blu-ray transfer. I'll forgive the ratio. I should have known better. I'm angry but I should have known better. This is not HD, not at all. There are no subtitles. The sound sucks. This 'blu ray' cost me nearly $50 and was not worth it at all. It should have been priced  between $20.99 - 29.99. The menu gives me headaches. Honestly I want to return it but I know the above reason aren't good enough for a refund. The only reason it should have cost this much is if it was a blu ray/dvd combo and it wasn't. This show and the fans deserved better.

Edit: I also found the menu on the first disc hard to navigate, especially the extras section. The second disc was easier to navigate. The sound still sucks though. I have to increase the volume so much and then, of course, when violence erupts it's too loud.",1418688000,14,832,4.226415094339623
6674210,5,B00NP06DJE,"A space western that comes once in a generation. Its animation quality, fluidity of motion, artistry, comedy, and action all hold up to this day.

For quick comparison Cowboy Bebop has much in common with Firefly, Outlaw Star, and Guardians of the Galaxy.

The focus of the story is on a gang of misfits that flounder through space getting into trouble, getting out of trouble, or just plain looking for trouble. The science fiction elements serve mostly as a backdrop (this is not a hard sci-fi show). Bebop is filled with fun comedy mixed with amazing action. It is episodic in nature, with most episodes having nothing to do with the others in plot except for the main cast. There is an overarching story that intermittently takes center stage, but for the most part Bebop is comfortable letting you just hang out with its cast.

Despite being released in 1998-1999, this show holds up perfectly. Fluid animation is timeless and 2D hand-drawn animation more so. More than just the animation the show shines in cinematography. Taking huge inspiration from Film Noir, American action movies, Hong Kong action movies, and more. Spike's martial arts prowess is as impressive as Bruce Lee's, and the wackier stunts are a fine example of anime action/adventure. Cowboy Bebop is a rich fusion of styles which combine into a masterful viewing experience.

A special mention goes out to 90's anime mechanical designs. These days all the mechanical designs are done through 3-D animation, often causing a rigid stiffness or fakeness to mechanical objects. The 2-D designs of Bebop feel real, rickety, and used. You really feel the love that went into the animation every time a piece of a ship tears off.

The Jazz/Blues soundtrack is also truly inspired, and is Yoko Kanno's best work. There are several tracks for each episode, with songs tailor made for each scene, covering a range of moods from melancholy to jollity. Most songs used in this show never repeat. The SEVEN album soundtrack for Cowboy Bebop can easily stand alone from the show as a work of art.

It is regularly regarded as the best anime series to come out of Japan, and it arguably still holds that highly contested title in 2014, a full 16 years later.",1417564800,22,2218,4.839050131926121

Between all three versions, the content on the discs are the same so you are not missing out on anything there.  Where things get tricky is Amazon is offering a limited Edition clamshell art box (their words not mine) and 2 books with concept sketches and drawing of the crew of Bebop (1 color 1 black and white).  Where as Funimation depending on how you look at it offers a little bit more.  Funimation's Limited Edition set comes with the following: Exclusive tri-fold packaging in the style of a vintage record cover | Display easel | Five exclusive art cards (one with a foil-stamp autograph from series director Shinichiro Watanabeyou).

As Funimation the studio who has the rights here in the US release more info I will update this review.  As stated before, below is the specs and what is included in all versions of the Blu-ray release minus the tech specs for the dvd copies in the limited edition sets.

6674255,4,B00NP06DJE,"The discs come in a plastic snap case. The discs play fine, however there are ads at the beginning of each disc that can't be bypassed. Fast forward doesn't work, nor skipping, nor menu. Bad Sunrise Company for forcing ads on viewers! They ruined what would have been a perfect viewing experience. This is why I gave four stars to this order instead of five.

The series itself is the best adult animated show I've ever seen. There's a little girl computer hacker who joins the crew in episode nine and then leaves in episode 24 with the dog two episodes before the end of the series. That was the saddest scene in the series for me. It was like real life where people drift in and out of your life. But it was a perfect departure because of what happens to the rest of the crew in the final episode. The combination of great storytelling, outstanding music and lovable characters make Bebop a memorable series that begs to be viewed more than once.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. Westworld and Outlander are a couple of my current favorites.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2374,5.124031007751938

I love the movie, but had a real hard time getting into the show. There is an obvious difference in animation quality in the show and movie. The show looks much older than the movie even though it's only 3 years older. The show also feels a little slow at in the beginning. However, give it time. This show is pretty long compared to some shows and I quickly changed my mind. I wanted it to grip me at the start of episode 1 because of my love for the movie, but it built up over the series.

6674312,4,B00NP06DJE,"I just rewatched this entire series after watching it when it was new nearly twenty years ago (which I still can't get over). What was pleasantly surprising upon my second full viewing was the program's style and depth...the characters are interesting enough, the universe novel enough and the set pieces exciting enough to keep an old, more-or-less ex-Anime fan entertained throughout. I'm not sure if simply growing older made me fall out of love with Anime or if the industry's uneven and inconsistent quality made the task of searching for hidden gems too laborious to be worth it. Anyway, this particular program escapes many of the banal and cheap trappings that plague so much Anime these days. It doesn't escape all of them though. There's a significant amount of fan service and some episode plots that were a bit too ambitious for a roughly twenty-five minute running time, resulting in some developments that either don't make a lot of sense or aren't explained in adequate detail. That shouldn't prevent you from giving this program a view though. It's one of the best (perhaps the best, depending on your taste) the genre has to offer and is likely to entertain even some of the harshest critics.",1507507200,,1209,4.902439024390244

6674337,5,B00NP06DJE,"Otaku John here, the anime / manga fan chiming in to rate another great anime series.  Cowboy Bebop is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece of anime perfection that hits 5 stars on all levels. Excellent story, writing, characters, animation, direction, and voice acting.  There's been hundreds of impersonators since this one, but none have equaled the original masterpiece.  It mixes sci-fi with gritty yakuza urban street life, all with a philosophical undertone of the main character's (Spike Spiegel) personal conflicts with a ""bushido code"" that seems lost and astray now that he's no longer with the yakuza, and his yearning to reunite with his lost love, Julia, whose forbidden romance caused his downfall in the first place. You'll love all the characters, Faye Valentine, Jet Black, Ed, and Ein.  Music by Yoko Kanno is excellent as well. Even though its from 1998 the animation is NOT dated, and it holds up well in posterity.  If you're an anime fan, you've got to get this collection and watch it before the rest of the public is bamboozled by the upcoming live action film farce starring a guy who ""can't act his way out of a paper-bag"" and who seems to love to ruin any sci-fi flick he's in. (not to mention any names.)  I shudder at what people will think of Cowboy Bebop if they see the live action film without first seeing the great anime.  At any rate, check out the anime first.  And if you like to read, check out the Cowboy Bebop manga too. They're hard to get but worth it.  There's also a Cowboy Bebop standalone OVA film that's excellent.",1503619200,,1554,4.704797047970479

I liked how the characters rely on space travel using portal-like rings between planets, which are the real ones from our solar system, dressed up through fantasy. The character development is phenomenal; I came to love all of the main characters dearly for their strengths, flaws, and most of all, their quirks.

For me it just moved a bit too fast sometimes and I'd be wondering why they were doing something or how they knew something. I think that is the point for a lot of it though, it's trying to get a point or theme across, but not necessarily a clear story.

6674411,2,B00NP06DJE,"Unfortunately, the Funimation 2014 Blu-ray set is a DOWNGRADE from my Bandai/ZRO Remix DVD set in every way, except for Image/Sound.  Yes, the hi-def image is what you expect, its an upgrade from blurry standard def DVD quality, and that's the important thing, which is why I bought this.  However, the viewing experience here is unpleasant.  Sorry, but theres no other way to say it:  this is a bad disc set.  Keep in mind that I would not criticize if the price was $19.99, then I would expect the low quality bootleg-style missing features in my list below, but this was selling for a price of $59.99(!).

The show Cowboy Bebop is great, you can read about that elsewhere.  Heres whats wrong with this Funimation 2014 Blu-ray set:

EPISODE TIMELINING:  Bad.  The episodes on each disc are all chained together into a single 4 hour movie.  Yes, the intro and the credits are there for each episode, yes they are chapterized.  But the problem is when you fast forward or rewind, you are fast-forwarding through a 4 hour timeline.  If you press skip forward/back, you will have no idea what episode you're jumping into, and no idea whether youve even changed episodes or not. What we should have is a chapter selection menu for each episode individually that says INTRO  |  PART A  |  PART B  |  Outro.  Instead, here we get 8 episodes per disc tacked together into a massive 4 hour scrubbing bar.  You cannot do something so simple as glance at the bar to see how many minutes are left of your current episode, or how many minutes have passed. The timeline combines all episodes into a 4-hour movie.

NO episode DESCRIPTIONS or SUMMARIES or THUMBNAILS:  You will not find any description of the episodes in the menu.  No descriptions, no summaries, no thumbnails.  Every other TV show DVDs/Blu-ray Ive ever watched had some of these helpful things. This blu-ray doesnt have these helpful things.

AUDIO/LANGUAGE are not separately tracked:  Bad.  The Funimation blu-ray discs contain both Japanese and English audio versions, but they are not tracked correctly, it's broken. You cannot switch the audio using your player/remote button like you can with every other DVD/Blu-ray.  You have to exit go to the top level menu, go into Setup, then reload an episode.  Ive watched many foreign films (both live action and animation) and they all let me change the audio track at the press of a button during an episode. Thats what the button is for.  This is the 21st century.

SUBTITLES are not Tracked: Bad.  You cant turn on/off subtitles while viewing.  You must exit to the disc menu, click Setup, then go back into the show.  Even worse, you cannot turn on English subtitles if you have the English audio on. So, if you miss a snippet of dialog and you want to verify the words, too bad. If you're trying to watch in a quiet room, too bad. If you are a hearing-impaired person and you want to turn on English subtitles for closed-captioning, too bad. You can only do these things if you have the Japanese audio turned on. (Which you should, because the Japanese voice performances are way better than the English dub, but this is still terrible disc programming.)

MENU MUSIC:  Bad.  Every DVD and Blu-ray Ive ever watched (which is a lot) had perfectly fine music when you let your system sit on the menu screen, while you're getting ready and everybody gathers a plate of food.  But this Blu-ray plays 5 seconds of a song, then an irritating click noise plays, then the music cuts to a totally different song.  Its schizophrenic.  I think its supposed to be a joke, like Ed (character from the show) is listening to a radio and she keeps impatiently changing the channel.  Think of how much you like it when somebody keeps changing the radio station in your car every two seconds. And the changes don't fade out/in, an obnoxious noise plays when the song changes. Astoundingly bad choice by Funimation.

MENU SOUND EFFECTS:  the menu interface plays an annoying buzzing/click sound whenever you move around.  Its small, but annoying.  I normally wouldn't care about this, but due to the broken audio and subtitle tracking I mentioned above you might have to navigate these menus more than your average disc.

MENU GRAPHICS:  Bad.  I normally wouldn't mention something small like this, but it becomes obvious that no time or effort were put into this Blu-ray.  The menu does not even have any visuals..its just the letters for Cowboy Bebop raining down the screen.  And when you navigate the menu, the choice you are selecting *fades to black*, while the other words remain white.  This is very confusing when your menu only has 2 items (Japanese versus English audio tracks) because you have no idea which one you're highlighting.  Interface design fail. This would be no big deal if you could change audio tracks or subtitles on the fly, but you cant (see above), you must go into the top level Setup menu to deal with these.

I'm sure this sounds like nitpicking how often does somebody criticize the menu music and menu visuals?  Well, I bought this Blu-ray package to upgrade from my DVD.  Yet, the experience is noticeably worse in every area, except for image and sound.  Sad.  Funimation, you need to fire whoever was in charge of the disc programming.  The only good thing about the Funimation 2014 Blu-ray is it made me realize how *good* my old Bandai ZRO ""Remix"" Cowboy Bebop DVDs were.",1487721600,6,5400,4.713368983957219

6674415,4,B00NP06DJE,"Cowboy Bebop is a legendary anime that is a must see for anyone who loves the medium. As far as the product, the case was completely pristine in condition, and the disc worked perfectly. The anime is fairly dated, so the video quality can only be so good, but I can definitely say that audio quality is very clear and crisp. Every time the intro song would play, I listened to it the whole way through and had a blast.

*Important Note* For those who are planning on listening to the English dub, as this is one of few anime where I'd definitely recommend it, the Japanese include subtitles, but the English does not. I watch almost everything with subtitles regardless of the language, so this was very difficult to keep up with if I wasn't keeping up with it. Especially since this anime is one with quite voice acting, but loud and clear music and sound effects. Having your speaker loud enough to hear the dialog is difficult whenever loud, blaring gunshots interrupt. Otherwise, a great purchase that came in great condition.",1487289600,2,1030,4.628415300546448

This series has a little bit of everything, serious at times and funny at others. Not many shows have hit me as emotionally as this show did and I think that speaks for how good this series is. It is a little slow paced compared to other shows but if you stick with it and watch it through, you'll be sure to like it, even if you aren't an anime fan.

I say dialogue specifically because the music, intro, top menu, and any action scenes were all rather loud in comparison.

The characters are interesting and unique, and the plots are both reasonable given the universe and tell a story arc.

The animation graphics are at just the right level of detail and very well done.

A few notes to parents ... this might not be suitable for the younger viewers.  We tend to view cartoons as kid safe, but this series deals with some tough topics and a fair amount of graphic violence.

6674464,5,B00NP06DJE,"I bought the Cowboy Bebop complete series without ever having seen Cowboy Bebop; I had only ever heard good things about it and needed to check it out. I'm glad that I checked it out. It was truly a classic among anime.

Tank, the opening theme, is a very unique and iconic theme. It's bebop type jazz and it really sets the mood for the show. This show is full of great music though. Every episode has a great soundtrack that very much enhances the enjoyment. It also adds to character interaction.

The characters were really awesome and engaging. Each character feels unique. They also did very well with character development. I was very much impressed with the depth of each character. These characters definitely helped make the plot very enjoyable.

Now, the plot to Cowboy Bebop is pretty cool. It starts with them just out to make money, but it evolves into showing what drives each character. It all seems cohesive though, and just builds upon itself to an amazing climax. The story is definitely worth watching.

Overall, Cowboy Bebop is a classic that is befitting of a spot in anyone's anime collection. It's distinctive soundtrack will help get you hooked, the depth of characters will engage you, and it's story will take you for a great ride. I would definitely recommend getting this. If you have a chance though, I'd probably get the Amazon exclusive edition because it's chock full of extras. If you're looking for it on the cheap though, this edition is definitely worth it too.",1480723200,6,1498,4.75

Set in a not too distant future, this is at its heart a kind of space-western where bounty hunters scour the universe for criminals. The  main characters include a motley crew of an ex-assassin, ex-cop, data dog, genderless hacker and femme fatal, who together create a constant source of compelling stories, dramatic tension, action and humour. The series is also a masterpiece of noiresque narrative and is set in a kind of dystopian future in which Earth is abandoned after a global catastrophe. Each episode could be a stand alone film of artistic genius that make most other animes and films today pale in comparison.

6674497,5,B00NP06DJE,"Coming from someone who isn't really an anime person, saying how great this series is speaks volume. It's a gem. I'm choosy about which TV shows I decide to invest my time in, especially when it comes to anime. I don't like anything too ""weird"" or ""otaku,"" if you know what I mean. (Nothing against anime, just saying.) Cowboy Bebop has mostly Western influences and I feel anyone will love it--even people who aren't into anime. It has a perfect mix of fight scenes (hand-to-hand combat, gun showdowns, ship dogfights and more), suspense, humor, mystery, suaveness, sci-fi, romance and a great story line to boot. It's mature and cool, deep and resonating. Full of existentialism. The characters are well-developed and one cannot help but feel for all of them. I love shows like that. The protagonist is handsome and talented in about everything he does, and not in an off-putting way. His voice is also incredibly sexy and makes me swoon, which brings me to my next point. This is an anime where the English voice actors did a better job with the characters than the Japanese ones. The characters sound very natural and are seemingly brought to life. IMHO, this show is a needle in a haystack.

Another important point: this series has such a memorable score. I love blues/jazz and the music itself is undeniably good.

This DVD set is SUCH a great value. Normally one would have to buy all six DVDs for around $150, but this set is only about $30. One DVD in this set averages around $4.50 so you cannot beat the price. Buy this set if you are a Cowboy Bebop fan or want to get into the series. This is a great investment and I do not regret getting this. The CDs are all in perfect condition, and shipping was quick. I had a great experience with the seller.

This show is truly an artistic masterpiece in its own right. I first heard about Cowboy Bebop when I watched Adult Swim in middle school, and I'll be honest in saying it has stuck with me since.  I advise getting it before it isn't sold in this value bundle anymore!",1471651200,2,2030,4.523160762942779

This one was 138 episodes long, corny and had the same graphic problems until the last 60 or so episodes...then they suddenly improved in both graphics and quality of the episodes. Also, the same company issued a second series (of another 50 episodes) titled Angel Heart that was fantastic (both in graphics and great story quality).

6674534,4,B00NP06DJE,"I had the DVD's and loved this anime series. Now in Blu-ray doesn't look so good if you compare it to more modern productions. Since the mood and the visuals were the best parts of this anime, and the story is not good enough to hold it together, now I'm giving it 4 stars instead of the 5 I would have given it originally.",1464739200,,323,4.0625

The picture and sound quality are fantastic, and the Yoko Kanno soundtracks sound better than ever! Each disc is nestled safely in it's own holder, insuring you years of scrape-free, skip-free play and perfect presentation!

Compared to buying this series a few episodes at a time, you can't beat this complete set for quality AND great savings, too. I bought this set several months ago, have already viewed it many times, and it's still brilliant, with no playback problems at all.

Plus the soundtrack is perfect, and the characters are diverse. The main characters in particular contain such depth and humanity.

It always has and always will be one of my very favorite things to watch. Give it a shot. Dollars to doughnuts if you're an anime fan, you shan't be disappointed.",1458864000,2,467,4.559523809523809

Stories are poorly told, no coherent flow whatsoever. Most stories lack either beginning, middle or end.  Case in point, in one episode the protagonist chased after an alien creature all episode, all but one of his shipmates were bitten by said creature and comatose. In the last seconds, the girl on board just grabed the creature in her sleep and swallowed it, the end. In the next episode, everyone was magically healthy again. WTF?

And the opening theme is the most loud and obnoxious piece of noise I've ever heard in any TV show, bar none.",1458432000,,701,4.645161290322581

6674571,5,B00NP06DJE,"Attempting any kind of review of Cowboy Bebop is a daunting notion. The universe in which the show takes place is so immense it's difficult to get the right perspective necessary to present an opinion.

Sometime after a devastating space gate explosion obliterates our moon, leaving the Earth uninhabitable due to endless falling debris, the human race has expanded to the rest of the solar system, bringing various cultures and architectures to new cities on new planets. Crime is always an inevitable part of human society and bounty hunters are just as relevant as ever as crooks planet-hop, run, and hide from the authorities.

The crew of the Cowboy Bebop make a living hunting said crooks. There's big-hearted Jet, the former cop with a bionic arm. Spike, an easy-going fighter playing the bounty hunter game fast and loose. Fay, a mean-spirited woman suffering from amnesia and a longing to understand her previous life. And my favorite, Edward, an autistic and highly eccentric 13-year-old girl who works as the ship's computer hacker. I shouldn't forget Ein, the ship's intelligent Welsh Corgi.

Though there is an important story arc throughout the entire series most of the episodes are self-contained and have a Tales of the Unexpected vibe to them. The tone of the show alternates between light and goofy and dark and serious with heavy Western, Jazz, and Noir influences. Cowboy Bebop effortlessly explores themes of friendship, loss, existentialism, and comedy while pitching a semi-optimistic future where humans are able to use science and technology to extend through the universe.

I should also mention that this show RE-EALLY reminded me of Lupin III in many ways (not that it's a bad thing). If anyone reading this review is familiar with Lupin III you will understand what I mean. It all adds up to make a great show and perfect gateway anime for anyone who has been abstaining from the genre.

The Blu-ray looks wonderful in 1.33:1 1080p, though there is a lot visible dirt and dust inherent to the animation process, with very good DTS HD-MA sound. A hefty chunk of extras are also included, with Japanese (and subtitled) commentaries on select episodes.",1457049600,6,2179,5.024930747922438

My only complaint is that all video is still in 4:3 ratio, which is a normal thing to see in Blu-ray versions of older movies and shows. It's a small thing considering I've been putting off buying this series on DVD for years because of the price point in the past. I feel like a received a good quality product at a great price.

6674628,3,B00NP06DJE,I'm a big anime fan. I just couldn't get into this series. I didn't enjoy the pacing. So much stop and go. The storylines you care about only take up approximately 6 - 8 episodes. The other episodes feel like the god aweful filler placed in animes like naruto. Why do I care that Spike left an old lobster in the fridge? Seriously? An entire episode? Maybe this was just over hyped and I had high expectations.,1450224000,,410,4.337662337662338

6674633,5,B00NP06DJE,"The way I would sum up this anime is as one of the most unique I have ever seen. When I saw it on Adult Swim about 15 years ago, I was instantly hooked. This is about the crew of the bebop, a futuristic space ship. Over the course of the show, we learn about the characters pasts and how it shapes them. The most interesting character in the show is Spike, an ex-member of the syndicate now gone bounty hunter. I am not going to spoil the show, but his past constantly comes back to haunt him. Overall, a great anime with a great story and many 'likable' characters.",1449619200,,566,4.154545454545454

6674663,5,B00NP06DJE,"Funimation has done a stellar job bringing this Blu-ray set to North America, and while it is THE definitive way to watch the show in English, there are some nagging usability issues which should be noted.

What you need to know is that every episode is here in its original aspect ratio (4:3) in glorious HD, as it should be, with both the original Japanese audio with English subtitles and an excellent English dub done by Funimation.

That said, CG graphics in some scenes do look slightly blurry. As other reviewers have noted, this is because the show's CG graphics were originally generated in standard definition (in 1998!) and have been upscaled to HD for this release. To remedy this upscaling issue, these assets would have had to have been re-created in HD, which could have risked altering the style of the original (see Ghost in the Shell 2.0, Star Wars on Blu-ray, blegh!). Personally, Im glad the original animations were used.

Additionally, the original opening and closing sequences for each episode have been edited to replace the Japanese credits on-screen with English translations. While there is an option to watch the original sequences on their own on disc 3, and Funimation did a great job with the translated sequences (mostly matching the original's visual style), the Japanese sequences are memorable, and it would have been nice to have the option to watch each episode unaltered.

Minor usability issues:
- You cant switch audio/subtitle options during playback, so you won't be able to compare audio tracks on the fly. Kind of a bummer. You must back out to the main menu to make changes.
- English subtitles are tied directly to the Japanese audio track, so your only viewing options are English audio with no subtitles, or Japanese audio with English subtitles. There are no other language options.
- All episodes on each disc are combined into one long clip on the two Blu-ray players I tested, even when choosing a single episode from the main menu (for example, choosing the second episode on a disc will place you at around the 21-minute mark of a 3+ hour clip of all episodes combined). It would have been nice to have the option to watch one episode at a time.
- As others have mentioned, the way selections are made in the Blu-ray menu is counterintuitive: the item that is greyed out is selected and the items that are highlighted in white are not. There are sections of the menu with only two options (when picking between Japanese and English audio, for example) where this can be confusing even if you know what to look for.

I should also note that my Blu-ray copy of Bebop arrived with two of the nubs holding each disc in place broken off, which fell out of the box when I first opened it. Since it took me a few weeks to open my set after buying it, I wasn't able to exchange it for an un-broken version in time. I don't hold this against Amazon, since Im sure they would have honored an exchange if I had reported the issue in time.

I wasn't even midway through the series when I knew I just had to have this in my collection. 26 episodes of the coolest thing to ever be put to pen and paper.

Also, shipping on the DVD was incredibly fast! Even better!",1439164800,12,377,4.236111111111111
6674707,5,B00NP06DJE,"This set is GREAT. It has all the episodes, 5.1 tracks for both English & Japanese audio, English subtitles (only on the Japanese audio, due to Sunrise possibly to discourage reverse importation from people in Japan, since anime is cheaper here than there), & it is PACKED with bonus features.
Video quality & presentation: The video quality is great from what I've seen so far. It's very much a great transfer. Really speaks to the quality of the animation team that it still looks great after all these years. Yes, it's in 4:3, but that's how it's supposed to be. It was created in 4X3, being animated in the late 90s before HD was even a thing, so don't you EVER expect this show, or any other shows from around the same time to be in 16:9 without the use of cropping, which is the worst thing you could do to a show that can't be readily put into 16:9 because it wasn't produced in that way.
Yeah, 10/10.
Audio: Great transfer as well. Like I said, 5.1 surround sound, so if it's very dynamic in it's sound, it's due to that. Again, 10/10.
The special features are also really good.  They're a mix of old special features from previous releases & some new ones as well. It's full of commentaries, retrospectives, & interviews, what you'd want & expect from a release like this. There's even a disc just for the extra features that couldn't fit on the other discs, that tells you how greatly they cared when putting this set together. They're definitely a great watch.
This set is great & for those that have problems, I feel sorry for you & hope that you can fix your problems, or try to do research before buying something so you can save yourself the headache.",1439164800,,1666,4.462295081967213

Perfect example, first episode when Spike is launching swordfish from the bebop for the first time, all the cockpit hatch closing, landing gear unlatching, hangar bay door opening and engine sounds effects that give the series a delicious authenticity and immersion are barely heard! They managed to ruin what is arguably the best anime series of all time! And my personal favorite. I own the original Bandai release on DVD, I know what the sound is supposed to be, and it's truly awesome. And it seems funimation didn't even care to compare and contrast. They should have just used that audio track from the old Bandai release, and added the hi-def video over it. How they could screw it up so bad on Bluray is beyond me.
Believe me this review is in no way a reflection on this masterpiece of anime. But do yourself a favor, just buy the old DVD set. The sound is too important to be treated this way.",1438992000,6,1069,4.602094240837697

6674733,1,B00NP06DJE,"I saw a couple reviews that said that this collection was difficult to use and not much of an upgrade.  I wish I had paid more attention!  The level of cheap production and baffling decisions borders on unbelievable!  The quality of the video is nothing special compared to the DVD versions I have previously watched but it is decent.  That is the one ray of light in this otherwise laughable excuse for a collection.  The menu is the opposite color of most others so you will constantly be fighting to find out if an option is selected or not.  There is no way (that I found) to skip the commercial for another anime at the beginning of the disc so before you watch an episode, you HAVE to watch a commercial.  From w/in an episode, you cannot change the audio/subtitle settings so you have to quit, go back to the main menu, fumble w/the options (no confirmation of your choice so if you get it wrong and start again, you are back to square one.  I could go on but I think the point is clear.  AVOID this at all costs unless you just desperately need to have the comprehensive Bebop episode set.  In that case, Ill sell you mine for 10$!",1438041600,6,1139,4.330188679245283

I thought we were cool, you know selling me things I like at unbeatable prices, that's all fine and dandy. But Amazon why you got to play me like that and send me a classic like cowboy bebop in nice remastered HD in a dented and scratched case? You're lucky that I love this series way too much with it's endearing characters, stand alone stories, and a resolution so fitting not too mention man tears. So you get a free pass this time Amazon but next time...

6674740,5,B00NP06DJE,"If you already have the DVD, skip this. Other than that, this is a very good quality Blu-ray. The video quality is obviously great, but even the sound is done well. On older shows (eg. Trigun), explosions and loud noises tend to be way too loud, and dialogue is too soft. This leads to me having to increase the volume too much to hear what characters are saying, and then having my head blown off by gunfights or explosions. Luckily, this Blu-ray does not have that problem. The extras are also nice, I especially liked Wendee Lee's commentary.",1437264000,,545,4.571428571428571

6674743,4,B00NP06DJE,"Amazing series now looks great on my big tv and sounds great with my 7.2 surround sound. This is the best version of Cowboy Bebop you can get.

For anyone flipping through reviews and reading complaints that it's not widescreen..they don't understand aspect ratios. It shouldn't be widescreen, because then it wasn't made that way and would end up poorly cropped (like it's shown on CN). There are also complaints about the audio...but you just need to go into the menus to change it to match your setup. Now...those menus...

I'd love to give this 5 stars, but these menus are atrocious.... who in the world thought that using grayed out as selected and white as not selected made sense. There are also inexplicably no subtitles for the English track. I will likely never watch it in English, but they should absolutely be there. That said, Cowboy Bebop is basically the gold standard for quality dubs, so I'm glad it's on the discs.",1437177600,8,934,4.723926380368098

This set just takes it even further. The tracks were arranged so that it would play in 5.1 surround for English. If you are a purist, you can switch it back to the original stereo in both language tracks.
The visuals are mainly restored, though, as you can read in another, better review, some elements had be up-scaled. Personally, I wasn't bothered.

6674764,5,B00NP06DJE,"Very good series, but I am not huge on episodic plots on TV series. However, the 5 episodes that focus on Spike's story are some of the best episodes of television I have ever seen.",1435276800,,181,4.2
6674765,3,B00NP06DJE,"To be clear, Cowboy Bebop is an incredible show. It's one of the best anime ever produced; the design, soundtrack, animation, and writing are all superb. Cowboy Bebop is a 5 star anime; the Blu Ray release is not.

Most of the show looks great on this release, but, ever now and then, a shot looks jagged as if pulled from a DVD. The sad thing is that these shots are usually of hand-drawn scenes. A perfect example of this is the shot near the end of Jamming with Edward which shows Ed controlling the Bebop in the background. Ed and everything in the fore and middle grounds looks seriously pixelated. I think part of the problem is that the subtitles are burned in. My player allows me to change language and subtitle settings on the fly but, with the Bebop Blu Rays, I'm stuck with whichever language I chose at the disc menu. Logically, this means that each disc contains two versions of each episode which explains the compressed look of some scenes. I can accept that the CG ships and planets look a bit blurry; I doubt anyone expected those scenes to be completely recreated. After all, anime is nowhere near as popular in the U.S. as it was when Bebop was released. The menus are very poorly designed. They looks nice but choosing specific items is very counter intuitive. Hint: grayed out text is chosen; white text is not. I am really glad that Funimation did not crop this to fit widescreen. Aspect ratios should be maintained.

To date, the best SD anime to Blu Ray transfer I've seen is Ranma 1/2. Viz really did an outstanding job there. They maintained the proper aspect ratio and provided a beautiful transfer. The Patlabor Blu Rays also deserve special mention for pure quality of the transfer.

For the price, the Cowboy Bebop Blu Rays are a bargain but buyers should know not to expect the best visual fidelity out of this set.",1435276800,25,1847,4.54054054054054

This anime was mostly drawn and not computer animated, so seeing it with great HD was amazing., All the animation feels as if it was animated from scratch with HD.

I'm also not a fan of the advertizements they have for other shows before it kicks over to the Blu Ray menu...I get that it's targeted advertizements, and honestly, I probably WILL check out some of the shows they advertized but that information should be locked away in a sub-menu, not present every time I load up the disc.",1431475200,3,519,4.7444444444444445

6674802,5,B00NP06DJE,"The one and only anime I can dig that deals with science fiction. Everything about this show is superb, from character development and portrayal, to story and plot development, to overall aesthetics and sense of satisfaction while watching.

The blu-ray version is excellent, there are hardly any signs of upconverting or digitalizing at all. From the lines in hyperspace to the fiery heat of entering Earth's atmosphere, these things give off a feeling of being upconverted, but it's so minor that it doesn't distract your viewing experience at all. I didn't notice any gradient banding, either. The sound was excellent and I am very happy to have this finally back in my collection.

Oh beware, the subtitles are burned into this. That really annoys me, but for some people it's no big deal.",1430956800,,793,4.954887218045113
6674803,5,B00NP06DJE,"I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of anime, but Cowboy Bebop ranks among the top animated shows of all time. It is hands-down, one of the most re-watchable shows I have ever seen. The Blu-Ray set really does this show justice, as the picture quality definitely trumps the old DVD set. Yes, the CGI effects in this Blu-Ray set are still 480p and do look somewhat dated, but the 1080p remaster of the animated sequences look better than ever. Be aware that this is a 4:3 (square TV) aspect ratio, as this was aspect ratio it was animated in at the time, so there is no screen cropping to make it 16:9 widescreen. The sound quality has also seen an upgrade to 5.1 surround and sounds great. If you've never seen Cowboy Bebop before, you should do yourself a favor and add this to your collection. The only downside that I can see to this box set is that there isn't an included digital download copy of the show included with the Blu-Ray release. Other than that, it is well worth the asking price for a classic animated series.",1430870400,3,1031,4.403141361256544

6674825,5,B00NP06DJE,"Few anime have aged as well as this one. The visuals are as crisp as anything you'll see in the new, mainstream animation, with gorgeous and diverse designs that really ground the stories. The characters -- Spike, Jet, Faye, Ein, Edward -- play with tropes and archetypes but become wholly visualized, funny, and real. The music, by Yoko Kanno, skips from baroque to jazz to pop to country; a few of the songs, especially ""Blue"" and ""Tank,"" are in my playlists 15 years after I first watched the show. About that: I first drank in ""Cowboy Bebop"" as a college freshman, from a friend who'd paid probably $20 each for the six DVDs that collected the series. Anyone who loves sci-fi should leap at the chance to own this for the current price.

My only caveat about the set (not enough of one to lower my rating) is that the special features are forgettable. The Blu-Ray keeps all of the series on three discs. The fourth collects a few scraps, including a strangely boring cast reunion that consists entirely of the old English voice actors eating dinner and finishing each other's reminiscences of what the job was like. This is shot from one camera, angled to the side of the table, like the secret tape of Mitt Romney talking about the 47%. I'd have loved more about the music and the development of the series, but you can find that elsewhere. All you really need are the episodes.",1428192000,2,1383,4.576612903225806

The sound was great on my surround sound system.
Watched through the series on dvd before this arrived and then watched the series on bluray, and the picture and sound quality difference is like night and day.

A few notes on the lower star ratings on here:
the original aspect ratio is in tact, it'd be a bad thing for it to be cropped to be widescreen; With that said, this set is in HD ... it doesn't have to be in 16:9 aspect to have HD quality. The HD picture quality on this blu-ray set is much better than the picture quality of the dvd's.

6674854,5,B00NP06DJE,"One of the greatest anime series ever made. It's the story of Spike Spiegel, a former mob member who know works as a ""Cowboy"", which is the handle for a bounty hunter. It's 2077 and the Earth is barely habitable after a disaster on the Moon. Humanity has move to Mars and outer planets, or simply live on spaceships. Gates are used to move ships between the more distant points in the Solar System. It was research into Gates that caused much of the Moon to be destroyed.
Spike lives on a ship called the Bebop owned and piloted by a former cop who has had some cybernetic replacement parts installed after being seriously wounded. Later on, Edward ( a computer supergeek) and Faye Valentine join the motley crew.
The BD remaster maintains the original quality while improving the resolution and sharpness, yet, it retains its original 4:3 aspect ratio, so this IS vertically-letterboxed.

6674888,4,B00NP06DJE,"Since the source material for the transfer was originally intended for standard definition, this new box set is not a vast improvement over the DVD box-set. So, if you already own the DVDs, you're already set. The extras, well, I don't think a ton of new material about the English dub actors is worth the upgrade, while a lot of new material about the original voice actors or the Japanese production team would have been awesome. Don't get me wrong, but the extras are not that interesting if you like the original Japanese language voices. The English language version is just one version, that adds as much to the series as any other version. On the other hand, since this is animation, it would have been great to have some more info about the original production. And that, sadly, is not the case. If you're either new to the series or a hardcore fan, this box will offer a somehow better transfer than the previous DVD box-set in terms of both sound and image (and in that respect I'd suggest you read the blu-ray.com review of this title, which is pretty accurate), but if you're not that much of a buff, stick to your DVDs.

Its one of the few works in any medium that can deftly switch between drama and comedy. If you need any more selling points, Cowboy Bebop also has some of the best characters in anime history, one of the best soundtracks of anything ever made, beautiful animation and is pure unadulterated fun.

6674928,5,B00NP06DJE,"So it goes without saying I love the show, so this review will be focusing on the Blu Ray release.

The Good:
- Picture quality is a big step up from the DVD.  Given it was hand-drawn and finished on film it will never look as crisp as modern titles, but it still looks crisp.  The blacks and colours are both a step up from the DVD, though if you play the DVD on a player that upscales the difference probably won't be as huge as you expect.
- The sound is amazing.  Even on my TV speakers I noticed a huge jump in audio clarity.  They've clearly put some work into fixing up the audio for this release, and is by far my favourite upgrade.
- The extras are wonderful.  There isn't really anything new here, but it's still nice to know it's all there and is worth exploring.

The Bad:
- Some of the computer generated imagery stands out a little more than it used to, and sometimes isn't as crisp as the rest of the picture.  This is simply because it was originally mastered in standard definition so they could only upscale it so much.  The use of CG is minimal in the show though, so I really only noticed it when I was looking for it.
- Trailers at the start of each disk is a little annoying, but unlike some reviewers I had no problem skipping them.  Just press ""menu"" instead of ""skip forward"" and you can get right to the show!

Summary:
- A great release of a great show!  Given that anime often goes out of print and can become expensive, I'd say pick it up now while you can!  Highly recommend.",1423008000,2,1505,4.166089965397924

Yes, the presentation is full 1080 HD, however it is presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio.  This is how it was drawn people, so no, it will not fill your widescreen HD tv, there will be black bars on the sides.  If you ""zoom in"" on it with your tv, you will cut off the top and bottom of every frame, and it will no longer look HD, so just don't that's a silly thing to do anyway.  Some of the CG effects in the show don't look as good as the rest of the animation, and that is because these shots have been upscaled from their original 480i rendering, it's just the cost of when this show was made.  Aside from that, the transfer is beautiful, the sound is excellent, and the extras are fun but by no means abundant.  If you want to watch Cowboy Bebop again or for the first time, this is the best way, and it's not at all overpriced.",1421884800,13,942,4.032258064516129

The show is fantastic.",1421452800,,351,5.051724137931035
6674960,5,B00NP06DJE,"The best version of Bebop yet!  As others have pointed out, it's not 16:9 because it was originally created for 4:3 television.  It never existed in 16:9 widescreen, and never will.

But who cares about widescreen!  The conversion is excellent and well worth it.  It sill looks fantastic and is quite an upgrade over what is currently being broadcasted.

As is the remixed 5.1 audio.  If you don't have a surround sound system, depending on your receiver it may sound worse - that's not the fault of these BlueRay's - other than perhaps lacking a pure stereo track.  Since I think audio can be as, if not more, important than the video quality, I have a very nice 5.1 surround sound system with a fairly respectable sub woofer to go along with my very nice plasma display.  This set takes full advantage of my sound system.  It's pure auditory bliss.  The soundtrack and musical score on Bebop was always superb - now it can really be shown off nicely!  They didn't just do some post processing to the original mixes, these disks have a completely new 5.1 mix and it is very obvious to anyone who appreciates a good surround sound mix!

Overall I'm very pleased with the set and I'm thrilled there are companies like Funimation who put obvious care and passion into re-issues like this.  It's greatly appreciated by the fans, as the current rankings in Amazon's sales charts reflect!  Hopefully this will encourage more companies to do quality re-issues that take full advantage of the latest technology as much as possible.  I may have to pick up the reissue of Ghost in the Shell if it has been done to the same quality level as Bebop!",1421366400,3,1637,4.612456747404845

6674976,4,B00NP06DJE,"Overall great picture and sound quality.  There are some frequent instances of colorbanding and a some obvious edge enhancement going on here and there, but this doesn't do anything to detract from the presentation.  Honestly the fact that a show this old looks this good is amazing.  The show does look stunning, easily the definitive version of the series.  It's simple, if you're a fan get this set.

There are some odd menu issues for me though, whoever authored these discs needs to be thoroughly slapped with a fish.  When you're in the blu ray menu, which is nice and simple btw, and you want to highlight a selection it gets a bit confusing.  For example, let's say you want to select the English dub (why not it's actually very good), so you highlight the English dub and press ok ... and when you hit play it's in Japanese.  Wha?  Yeah the non-highlighted item (dim) item is the one that is actually being selected.  This is a completely counterintuitive authoring decision and it makes changing up your menu selections maddening.  Part of the problem has to do with the menu backgrounds, on the first disc the background is black so it just looks like nothing is selected.  On the second the menu background is green (i think?) and when you select and item it's a very dark gray which makes a bit more sense, but still.  Confusing.

The other thing is that you can't have subtitles activated while listening to the English dub.  Yeah the subtitles are tied directly to the Japanese track.  So if you're a fan of the English dub and want subtitles for whatever reason ... tough, not gonna happen.  This is a small nitpick but again it's such an odd decision it makes me wonder who was making these decisions.

These minor nitpicks shouldn't deter you from buying this series though.  It truly is the best version of Bebop around, and any fan will love these blurays.",1420761600,74,1876,4.613293051359516

If you have the DVDs, do not by the set. The volume is pretty awful. You have to turn the television up all the way in order to hear the dialogue. In addition, the menus are overly complicated. While the picture is beautiful, and I do understand the rationale for keeping the original aspect ratio, it looks ridiculous on a HD widescreen television. Lastly, and I have heard this before, the case was cracked.

Relatively inexpensive, but not worth the money. I am glad the limited addition case was sold out and that I did not spend a ridiculous amount to get it because I would have been very disappointed.",1419638400,11,781,4.423611111111111

I have to say, I was really hoping to buy the Limited Edition BD/DVD Combo, but, somehow, it sold out before it was even released, and now the price is through the roof. After that, I was pretty torn between getting just the DVD version or the Blu-ray version, but then I settled for the Blu-ray because of the special features. Oh, does it have a lot of special features. Some of them only come with the Blu-ray, so, if you're like me, get the Blu-ray. About the anime itself, it's an intense, futuristic drama that doesn't have all drama, but plenty of comical moments, too. A little something for everyone, I believe.

6675039,4,B00NP06DJE,"I was so excited to watch my new blu-ray edition of Cowboy Bebop. I put the first disc into my PS3 and fired it up. Greeted by the title screen, I immediately selected Settings. Imagine my surprised when I noticed my only options were for English Audio or Japanese Audio. No subtitle settings what-so-ever! No worries, I'll just hit play and change the subtitle settings through the options menu on the PS3. I selected ""English Audio"" and clicked Play All. The series started, I hit Triangle on my controller, selected subtitles. Nothing!

I hit menu for the blu-ray [the options pop-up while the video still plays] and selected Settings. Switched it to ""Japanese Audio"" to see how they would expected people in the US to watch the Japanese version without subtitles. There were subtitles! It appears they elected to hard-code the subtitles for the Japanese Audio. I've read the reasoning for this is to discourage importing, and I'm OKAY with that. My problem isn't with the hard-coded subtitles; my problem is there are no options for subtitles for the English Audio!

I find it extremely difficult to understand why a blu-ray in 2014 would be created and shipped without this as an option. What about hearing-impaired [not deaf] individuals? They can still hear a little bit, but require subtitles to follow along. They might not want to hear the Japanese voices, but they have no other option! Personally, I turn on subtitles because it makes it easier to follow the story lines. Granted, I've watched Cowboy Bebop enough to know all the words [and songs], but people new to the series (ie friends or family) wouldn't be able to do this. This is pretty much a requirement for my family to watch movies these days.

Enough negativity. I love Cowboy Bebop and love having it in True HD. I was initially surprised it was in 4x3, but realized too many older series have been ruined by companies switching to 16x9 [see Buffy], which results image cut-offs or stretching. If you'd like to see what that would look like, pause the episode and flip through the picture settings on your TV. You'll see one for ""zoom"". That'll give you an idea of what it would've looked like if they had converted to 16x9.

NOTE: The first episode ended, and finally, there were subtitles. For the ending credits. Which uses a Japanese song. That's it.",1419206400,2,2330,4.774193548387097

6675071,5,B00NP06DJE,"Cowboy Bebop is my favorite anime and I'm ecstatic to finally have it on Blu Ray. This set isn't perfect, but it is the best this show is ever going to look. I'd like to address the negative reviews that have started to come in. Their complaints seem to be three-fold:

- The show isn't really HD because it isn't widescreen.
- The show isn't really HD because it is upscaled, and doesn't look better than the DVDs.
- The sound is somehow worse than before.

All of these claims are absolutely wrong. Firstly, the show was originally made in 4:3. That means that converting it to widescreen would require cropping, which would mean both loss of fidelity and loss of parts of the image. If this had happened, I would consider this transfer utterly ruined. Movies and shows should always be presented in their original aspect ratio, and cropping is unacceptable. They are still very much HD by definition.

Secondly, only certain elements of the image are upscaled from SD: the computer animated ones. Anything that contains CG planets or spaceships is noticeably upscaled. While unfortunate, these elements were CREATED in SD, so no HD elements have ever existed for them. It's just something we're always going to have to live with when it comes to this show. That said, the entire rest of the show, all hand-drawn animation, is indeed in native HD and looks significantly better than before. If you can't see the difference, I don't know how to help you.

I also think both the Japanese and English 5.1 mixes are excellent. If you find them inferior, I think you need to make some adjustments to you sound system. It might sound worse when played back in stereo, I don't know. It's unfortunate that stereo mixes weren't also included on the set, but the surround mixes are EXCELLENT.

If you already own the DVDs, it might not be worth the upgrade for you, but if you think it's an inferior version you are wrong.",1418774400,629,1914,4.650887573964497
