7342609,3,B0124KXP6E,"For my part, I thought this was slightly atypical for Bill Zebub.  It's heavy on the sexploitation (most of its 76 minutes consists of a man in priest's garb humiliating and groping young women in little to no clothing), including some very clear FFN.  As far as plot, though, there isn't much of one.  As ""torture porn"", this movie is pretty lightweight; only a little bit of bondage; quite a bit of intimidation; and otherwise a series of lengthy scenes of unwelcome, cringe-inducing groping.  It lacks the political and social screeds in his other movies.  Also lacking is all but a sliver of the dark comedy in most other Bill Zebub productions.  With the droning soundtrack of chanting broken up by infrequent metal riffs and the reptitious nature of the rapist's crimes, it is kind of a slog.

As another review already noted, this seems to be a re-cut of the 2010 film, ""Forgive Me for Raping You"".  Having not seen the original, I have no idea what was cut.  Given that it flows smoother than some of Mr. Zebub's older films, I imagine that a lot of repetition and long, lingering shots were removed.

I like Bill Zebub's work, usually.  Sometimes insightful, always earnest and motivated, many times funny.  This movie isn't up to his best.  Even in such an unerotic situation, though, the actresses' bodies are quite nice to see.  At least the bloopers are funny.",1449014400,47,1373,4.714285714285714
7342610,2,B0124KXP6E,"Cheap, thrown together movie by Bill Zebub and his regular cast already released and sold by Amazon under its IMDB title ""Forgive Me for Raping You"".  A movie about a priest who takes advantage of young impressionable women.  The kind of guy Paul warns Titus about.",1446768000,19,265,4.739130434782608

7342616,1,B0124KXP6E,"A terrible, terrible movie.  Worse than ""The Room!""  And I never thought that would be possible...  This dud makes ""The Phantom Menace"" look like a good movie!  If anyone tries to get you to watch this video, run.  Run far, run fast!  Hide!  Never talk to that person again because that person is no friend...  I gave this one star because that was the minimum...",1490140800,14,363,4.476923076923077

8725294,1,B0124KXP6E,"Doesn't even deserve one star.  On a score of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, let me score some of the film aspects.  Camera work, a 1, since it is choppy, distracting, and amateurish.  Yes, one will get plenty of breast and crotch shots, but sometimes the camera, when it leaves one region, suddenly goes back, as if they forgot something, and then returns to where it was.  Lighting a 1, as it is really poor.  Too much to expect they would buy some decent lighting gear?  Music soundtrack is jarring and often unpleasant.  Dialogue?  Well, here is an example of what pretends to be good dialogue:  ""It is not rape, it is therapy!""  That is it a low budget film is saying too much.  It is less than a low budget film.  The women are tattooed and often have multiple piercings, so one can imagine where they cast the film.  No male nudity, and the simulations are laughable.  Voyeurs may find it titillating, but most would find it boring and offensive.  The DVD has promotions for other films, that appear to even be worse then this one.  I would avoid anything by this film maker.  Taking shots at religion seems to be a theme of his productions.  This is money wasted buying it.",1519257600,4,1183,4.398148148148148
