4263629,1,B0045O2PF0,"I had never seen About Last Night, it turned out to be an OK movie. I originally bought this set for the St. Elmo's Fire movie which will not work. So disappointed!!!",1410739200,,166,4.21875
4263630,5,B0045O2PF0,I love these movies. They just don't make them like this anymore. Honestly I must be a old soul or something BC I'm in my twenties and just love these movies. Plus Rob Lowe and the other guys are to cute to pass up.,1405900800,,215,3.909090909090909
4263631,5,B0045O2PF0,i enjoyed both 80's movies! Rob Lowe...Andrew McCarthy..Demi Moore..Emilio Estevez..great casts in both! i recommend these movies to friends who like comedy and drama,1392076800,,166,5.958333333333333
4263632,5,B0045O2PF0,"This was a great deal, 3 movies in 1. Bought it for my teenage daughter, these are at least 3 movies every teenage girl should watch",1389916800,,132,4.115384615384615
4263633,4,B0045O2PF0,"ST. ELMO'S FIRE is a thoroughly repugnant film. Demi Moore's character gives new meaning to the word ""trash."" Her mouth spews four letter words in gravely filthy foul tones that make the viewer squirm in disgust. Judd Nelson's character is a pathetic cardboard caricature of rage personified that Nelson seems to typify in all his roles. Emilio Estevez tries in his role, yet it is another role suited for his screen persona. Good to see Martin Balsam even though this is a throwaway role for him. Ally Sheedy once more wastes her talents in this mindless teenage romp trying to make the audience identify with them with some form of empathy.  Andrew McCarthy character acts like an Andrew McCarthy clone. Rob Lowe's character and is the one saving grace of this film. Rob Lowe once again commands the screen with his distinctive presence as a man who has more going than meets the eye.  Rob Lowe is excellent in this film. Mare Winningham gives her usual performance and it fits her character. Even Andie MacDowell shinned in this film. Her presence is minor, yet very effective. Director Joel Schumacher simply demonstrates his niche for mediocrity with ST. ELMO'S FIRE. This film is truly a waste of time except for a few moments of radiance from some of its cast. On ther other hand, Edward Zwick's direction saves ABOUT LAST NIGHT. Edward Zwick directed GLORY, LEGENDS OF THE FALL and THE LAST SAMURI among others and his craftsmanship is evident in ABOUT LAST NIGHT. The cinematography by Andrew Dintenfass is very good and truly sets up several key scenes. I really loved Elizabeth Perkins in this film. She draws you to her in almost all her scenes. This film is not a lightweight 80s romp like so many other films of that era and genre. And then there is James Belushi. He is an incredible actor. ABOUT LAST NIGHT is a film worth watching. ST. ELMO'S FIRE, well that's another question.",1377561600,,1895,4.739393939393939

4263650,1,B0045O2PF0,"Do not buy this if you are expecting an actual widescreen version of ""About Last Night..."" It is NOT widescreen, but the 4x3 (1.33:1 ratio) version. This makes me wonder if the Blu-Ray version is worth buying.
At least ""St. Elmo's Fire"" is the widescreen version.",1431993600,,263,4.739130434782608
