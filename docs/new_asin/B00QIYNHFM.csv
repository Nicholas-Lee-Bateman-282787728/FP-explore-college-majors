8691429,1,B00QIYNHFM,"If youve ever been slapped hard across your face, you know it isn't funny.  Even as a kid I saw nothing funny about a short fat man being repeatedly slapped and insulted by his bad-tempered partner. I always wanted Lou Costello to suddenly look at Bud Abbot and say menacingly , O.K. Bud, Thats it! if you slap me one more time, you're dead meat!"" THAT would have been funny. But of course that never happened. And they proceeded to make movie after movie in which Lou Costello continued to be unmercifully slapped and bullied and teased by Bud Abbott. Their laughing audience never realized they were contributing to the sick social illness of ""bullying"" and the tormenting low self esteem and suicide that often results in real life. Of all the comedy teams, A & C are the worst offenders.  Leo Gorcy of the Bowery Boys runs a close second. He too, like Bud Abbott was a bad-tempered coward who liked to slap the most timid of his friends, knowing he won't get hit back.  And the 3 stooges rank third, but at least they each get slapped around equally, which still sets a sick example of how friends should behave, but at least they're equally abusive to each other.",1524182400,,1168,4.5260663507109005
8691430,3,B00QIYNHFM,"This is originally from ""Goodtimes Home Video"" 1986 and looks pretty much like a VHS transfer. The text is jagged, the film quality fair to middlin' - that said, as an introduction or an overview, it's not too bad. If you're a fan of these famous funny men and women, you'll have seen the original and complete movies, shorts, and skits so this probably won't appeal to you. But if you're new to the classics, this could be worth a look. And who doesn't like Steve Allen?",1499817600,,471,4.425287356321839
