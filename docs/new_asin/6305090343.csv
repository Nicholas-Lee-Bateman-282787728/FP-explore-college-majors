963965,3,6305090343,"David Cronenberg's (DC) first comercial film is given a surprisingly clear transfer, though there is some pixelation and glitching in a late scene that I don't recall being on the LD release, it *may* be a problem on my  DVD copy.
Really the first film in the resurgence of biological horror  movies.  In many ways this is one of the inspirations for ALIEN, aparently  Dan O'Bannon even cites to it directly.
All of DC's prime issues are  here, even the twins and some of the social issues from Dead Zone.  In many  ways this really feels like the seed from which many of DC's later work  will grow.  At times the film is clumsy and it's 70's independent budget  and style haven't really aged well but a lot of this can be forgiven  because of the doors this film opened.  In it's way it is as important as  Haloween or Eraserhead, of course that also means that it has a small but  devoted audience.

963966,5,6305090343,"Cronenberg's first movie ever, 1975, SHIVERS is amazing to watch to see the embryonic stages of where his next 11 films would come from. Recomemded not only for CRONENBERG fans but for obscure horror fands as well.",911260800,,214,4.8108108108108105
964157,3,6305090343,"Oh goodness, what is there to be said about Shivers? It was Cronenberg's first feature-length film, and a lot of eventual hallmarks of his can be seen in a sort of prototypical form. At the time of its release, it was pretty much considered to be an exploitation film, and treating it as such, it's considerably better than many of it's genre-siblings. It's got an impressive budget of ~$600k (adjusted for inflation) and the effects aren't half bad, but one primary thing that needs to be remembered is the influence of this film: along with Rosemary's Baby, Shivers is the progenitor of the ""body horror"" genre, wherein horror is achieved by way of biological violation. All in all, I think the best thing that can be said about Shivers is that it's significantly better than I was expecting.",1501804800,,794,4.760869565217392

964237,2,6305090343,"A little too cheesey for me.  This type of late 60s movie tries to transmit the message that if you just give in to your base urges then everything will turn out ok in the end.  Resist them and bad things happen.  It's a ""free love"" promotion in some ways and also tries to excuse some rather dispicable behavior(such as taking advantage of sexuality in young children) to be just a part of the human experience.  Either that or whoever made the film was simply trying to ""shock"" the viewer by exemplifYing various sexual taboos.  Either way, I found parts of the movie humorous and other parts in very bad taste.  Surprisingly,  the acting isn't as bad as you might imagine for this kind of film.  At least concerning a few of the primary actors/actresses.",1484092800,,757,4.555555555555555

964245,4,6305090343,"The production definitely doesn't impress a millenial such as myself, but the premise is worthwhile. It's a mix of titillation, disgust, and comedy for me. I view the film as an elaboration on a philosophy of living. What is to happen if we all cut loose and relinquish those higher parts of ourselves? Which is better, the Dionysian or the Apollonian? I think the film tries to get the viewer to ask these questions. One of the lead roles in the film rambles on about everything being erotic, including the act of breathing. This seems like something that needs to have a book written about it. How sexuality encompasses every aspect of being. Well, all in all, the film itself is not particularly interesting, but the thoughts it arouses are worth the watch in my opinion.",1483401600,,774,4.698529411764706

964933,4,6305090343,"I only recently heard about this movie, but watching it, I was reminded of so many other books and movies.  Flesh by Richard Laymon for one, Slither by James Gunn for another.

The movie opens with scenes of an androgynous girl being murdered intercut with the marketing of an apartment building in Montreal. This is great horror, the interposition of normalcy and the unnatural continues throughout the movie.

The plot is basic, slug-like creatures are infecting people and filling them with lust.  The sex is constant but mostly off-screen, showing more the danger of desire...and later, the seductiveness of being possessed by the slugs, becoming one with the growing masses of erotically indulgent citizens. Those who do not willingly let themselves be seduced are raped or otherwise violated by the infected or the slugs themselves. Some interesting metaphors are at work here and the movie rewards thinking about, afterwards.

The lead is a fairly wooden doctor who lives in the building and although he knows early what he's looking for, he's simply not able to counteract the spreading infection.  At first, he simply doesn't take it seriously enough, later he is unable to act ruthlessly to prevent it's spread. In the end, he succumbs to the embrace of his nurse-lover...and two other near naked girls.

In the end, everything seems normal again as the infected go out to spread their slug-like progeny, to the willing and to the unwilling alike.  This is true horror, in which the hero is not promised success. Recommended.",1459209600,,1535,5.0395256916996045

Part of what sets it apart is that it takes place on an island in a large Canadian city and not in a big east coast city. That in itself is  refreshing. The story of a medical experiment gone wrong, at first it looks like the in-house doctor may be able to stop, but things get progressively worse, until everyone in the apartment block is infected and that is where the movie ends. Some gore, mild for the 21st century, but a bit much for its time, a bit of nudity here and there. There is also some violence and sexuality, plus cigarette smoking, you don't see so much of that in modern movies. Enjoyable, and forgettable.",1450051200,2,755,4.392857142857143

U.K. Distributor Arrowfilms is the only Distributor so far to release SHIVERS on BLU-RAY
as they did with RABID which I've also typed a review about, RABID is also on Blu-ray now courtesy of Arrowfilms

the HD transfer for Shivers is exactly the same as the RABID HD transfer
Done in Toronto Canada under David Cronenberg's supervision
which was then sent to Arrowfilms
and i tell you the quality is very Good, very nice sharp & clear picture quality, very nice colour restoration aswell
cannot same the same for the Sound quality, the Audio mix is only a 1.0 mono sound which does sound average
a master audio stereo mix should have been given for sure
which would've boosted the Dialogue in the film I think
as with RABID Arrow films have also added new special features with shivers
PARASITE MEMORIES- making Shivers a new retrospective Documentary for this new Blu-ray version
 with some of the cast & crew from the film
interviews with Barbara steele, Lynn Lowry, susan Petrie & Allan kolman & special effects artist Joe Blasco
ON SCREEN- 45min episode of the Canadian tv show looking at the making of Shivers
interviews with Cronenberg, Producer Ivan Reitman, executive producer John Dunning, Andre Link
and other cast & crew
this episode was recorded some years ago maybe 10 years ago but still worth watching
plus other featurettes, theatrical trailer, photo Gallery etc
there's a booklet included aswell
this Blu-ray also has the DVD version in the case
the dvd has exact same contents as the Blu-ray except the films picture quality is Digital remaster, not High Definition transfer
also the Blu-ray is region B locked and the dvd is region 2
so if you want this Blu-ray version you need all regions player
Definitely worth buying if you're fan of SHIVERS

965486,4,6305090343,"Nine Things About the Movie Shivers [aka They Came From Within]

1. Made in 1975, this was David Cronenberg's first film. As one of the godfathers of the ""body horror"" film genre, this film shows his first attempt at the topic of the human body as a frightening, strange, and grotesque process of destruction.

2. It's a strange little movie about rich, bland people living in an exclusive apartment complex on an island. A crazy doctor wants to get people to stop acting so boring and rationally. So he puts a creature in a girl that is designed to make her want to have sex, and then reproduce and spread to others like an STD. The parasite spreads to people in the apartment complex, and they all start trying to have sex with other people - willingly or not.

3. Now that I think about it, I think this is the only movie I've ever seen about sex zombies.

4. On one hand, this movie is a pretty bad exploitation film. The acting is amateur, and the script is clunky. The concept is ludicrously impossible. It made me laugh a few times when it wasn't supposed to. The special effects are... not very special.

5. On the other hand, this is a surprisingly original idea, especially for 1975. If you can get past the story, and pay attention to what Cronenberg is actually trying to say, it packs a nice little punch. Cronenberg said that the movie should be viewed ""from the point of view of the disease"".

6. All sexual contact is treated the same in this movie. Straight or gay, through incest or pedophilia, it's all depicted as grotesque and threatening.

7. The movie was pretty controversial for its time. Mixing sex and violence and monsters was not something that the general public was ready for.

8. The movie is also worth seeing just for the groovy 1970's fashion and style.

9. While not Cronenberg's best film, it's still very valuable for its ideas and as a way to see the evolution of his style and topics in later films.",1416009600,,1939,4.485795454545454

965489,4,6305090343,"""The kids today should protect themselves from the 70s."" Mike Watt

David Cronenberg films today distinguish themselves by a certain visual feelwith each film, he creates his own world, with its own physical texture. That's why it's so disconcerting to watch his early movies where there's so much less of that visual engineering... partly because he was focused on different things, partly because he didn't have the sort of funding he does now (not that he's rolling in money relative to, say, Whedon, Spielberg, etc), but also because he was interested in chronicling the Zeitgeist of the age he was living in.
Lest we forget: for the United States, Canada and the rest of the western world, the 1960s were an era of almost total social turmoil. Sexual liberation, drug culture, the Vietnam war and the Civil Rights struggle being just a few examples. It all sort of culminated in Watergate, and then President Ford called the troops home, and all of a sudden America and all the other western cultures under her influence began trying to enjoy some cultural peace dividends. Black and white, gay and straight, hippie and hard hat, man and woman, there was a sense that at last they could all sit at the same table and enjoy a left-leaning diet of Norman O Brown, Gloria Steinem, go-go dancing, astrology, and casually swinging free love. What was there to be outraged about anymore? It was time to give up all our ""hang ups"", especially those about sex. As one woman in this film states, (I paraphrase slightly), ""Even old flesh is erotic...even talking is erotic.""
You can see it all over this movie, the hippie-influenced designs, the prints of simple Picasso and Paul Klee images that implied that everybody could create great art just by expressing themselves, the hairstyles on young and old alike a little bit longer, the men's shirts unbuttoned a little lower, the women a little more androgynous...
And just like the Weimar Republic, the new order was doomed from the start, doomed from within. And Cronenberg documents that here in this movie. Is he alone in this? Of course not. From Leonard Cohen's Beautiful Losers to Taxi Driver to early progressive rock, most every great pop cultural achievement of the era was pointing an accusatory finger at the same malaise. But it was Cronenberg's genius to depict it as a literal malaise, a parasitic plague attacking a bucolic, utopian resort community near Montreal. Young and old alike, blue and white collar, all are exposed to the same turd-shaped worm creature which, upon entering the human body, begins spreading sexual impulses that spiral out of control toward violence.
I doubt that Cronenberg set out to write a horror movie. He set out to explore something in the culture around him, but by doing so he arrived at the same images of blood soaked civilians and swarms of lumbering zombie people that our horror pop culture is so focused on right now.
If you enjoy this movie, I encourage you to proceed to its intellectual successor, Beyond the Black Rainbow. There are so many similarities between the two, I envy anyone who gets to see them both for the first time back-to-back.

Soon, the tenants of the high-rise apartments are turned into a pack of mindless rapists and murderers who are driven only by the hungers of the flesh. SHIVERS announces the arrival of David Cronenberg into modern Horror, along with his particular brand of ""Body Horror."" If PSYCHO showed us that we cannot trust our friends or neighbors, SHIVERS tells us that we cannot trust even ourselves, since the real terror is in our own flesh as our bodies begin to betray us. Cronenberg envisions the end of the world not under the cloud of a nuclear holocaust, but as one big, beautiful orgy where man has reverted entirely to an animalistic state. SHIVERS derives much of its fear and paranoia from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, where we are unable to tell the infected apart from the sane or rational. On top of this, Cronenberg adds grotesque images of the creatures writhing in their victims' skins, just a hint of the horrors to come in his later films like RABID and VIDEODROME. While it is still an early testing ground for the psychosexual revolution that is present in Cronenberg's films, SHIVERS remains an important milestone both in his own career, and in the Horror genre at large.

Taking place at a luxurious apartment complex called Starliner Towers, ""Shivers"" is about a breed of biological disease mutants that transmit themselves sexually from person to person.

This is exploitation horror at its finest, and also has an intelligent script to boot along with its nuts-out display of violence and debauchery.

965648,5,6305090343,"David Cronenberg's 1975 debut film is layered with allegories and metaphors showing the talent of a young director and writer.

David Cronenberg took a concept that had been widely overlooked in a lot of `out break' movies. If humans were to somehow be brought down to our primal urges like in most virus or zombie films, how could sexual desire be overlooked? It is one of the most basic aspects of the human condition and because our culture labels sex to be such a foreign taboo outside of smut films, we were never really exposed to it outside of a beautiful thing in romance films.

Cronenberg's script runs with this concept to show that if we were subdued to our most basic sexual instincts, we would not worry about cultural standards in sexual partners.

The film takes place in a high-class apartment building located on a peninsula (or small island) and all hell starts to break loose when a medical experiment goes wrong creating parasitic creatures that turn people into sex-crazed maniacs.

I can see the controversy behind the material (especially coming out in the seventies) because this film has everything from rape, incest, pedophilia, gay and lesbian relations, murder, and so forth but it is far from a `snuff' film or anything like that. The directing and imagery is done in a `tasteful' manner where the audience knows what is happening but most of the brutal imagery is left off screen and to the audience's imagination (which only makes it more disturbing).

There are a couple things to keep in mind when you are approaching this film. The first is that this was David Cronenberg's first feature length film and he mentioned in the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cronenberg-on-Cronenberg-Directors-on-Directors/dp/0571191371/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cronenberg on Cronenberg (Directors on Directors)</a>&nbsp;(a very solid read) that making the movie was a learning experience for him as he made it. He had never worked with a film crew or `actual' actors before and the film was shot on a shoe-string budget in fifteen days, how is that for awesome?

I've read reviews were people put down the acting and special effects but in comparison to a lot of horror films that came out around that time I would say that it was a cut above the rest (Lower budget films I mean, not Rosemary's baby, The Omen, The Exorcist and so on...). I thought the acting from the main stars was pretty darn good, the special effects were extremely effective, and even when the acting by the extras teetered a bit; it did not break the pace or was so bad that you were taken out of the story.

The rooms, the colors, the outfits, the eerie but beautiful theme music, and the disturbing climax all add to the quality of the film.

Approach it with the right mindset and you are going to be in for a solid seventies horror flick.",1268092800,,2882,4.9523809523809526
965649,5,6305090343,"Cronenberg filmed (in 1996) an adaptation of J.G. Ballard's controversial novel, Crash, which explored a subculture that celebrated sex and car crashes.  Another great Ballard novel is High Rise -- its scenes of madness & mayhem in a modernistic apartment complex are strikingly similar to those in Cronenberg's film Shivers.

Shivers is a frequently disturbing, but never boring, film -- just my kind of movie.  Here are some hi-lights:

-- A fat middle-aged woman, her face heavy with cosmetics, attacking a waiter with the delivery cart.  (""I'm hungry...I'm hungry for love!"")

-- A couple complaining to the building manager about some missing items.  The manager invites them to his office, where surprises await.

-- Our hero taking refuge in one of the darkened apartments.  A light is switched on...revealing a man with his daughter.  (""You'll like my daughter."")

-- A delivery man, mother and daughter, now parasite-infected, attacking a security guard.  (An armed security guard, in fact -- one of the most useless security guards in the history of cinema.)

-- The parasite-zombies surrounding the indoor swimming pool.  Slow-motion kisses as parasites are spread mouth-to-mouth.

and starts to slice down her abdomen,he than pours in her stomach a
acid, walks away and takes the scalpel on himself by cutting his throat.
Whats not explained at first is why did this Doctor do that?  Well
later in the movie it is explained that the Doctor is a dirty old man
and likes his teenage girls.  The Doctor develops a parasite that
makes men/women have sex no matter with whom for long period of times.
David exposed HORROR to me at a very young age(6 yrs.old) and though
this movie does not have a chainsaw maniac or a 11 yr. old girl
that can impersonate a owl it has HORROR for the psyche!  To get back
to the story of the film the sexual parasites go from person to person
through their mouth and once it has you you are forever a sexual zombie
a SEXBIE so to speak. This movie is very influenced by Night of the
Living Dead.  All your heroes in the film are trapped inside The Hotel
and all your heroes either die or become SEXBIE'S one by one till
you have only one actor left who looks dead-on like Chuck Norris
from Return of the Dragon! He also gets it in the end(SPOILER) till
there is no one left in the Hotel to attack.  They all get in their
cars to drive off to other places and the D.J. on the radio says
the all to famous...PEOPLE ARE ATTACKING THEIR LOVE ONES,STRANGERS
ANIMALS??? LOCK UP YOUR DOORS DON'T TALK TO ANYONE AND-AND THERE

LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRGGG!  I really love this movie and yes it is
VERY low budget and the parasites look like Chicken Strips from a restaurant but it has a EERIE look to it,I still remember the feeling
I had when I first saw this and the one actor who looked like a deranged
Tim Allen with his stomach smoking from acid and blood in his mouth
giving me the CREEPS! Also the scene of the two little girls acting
like dogs complete with collars around their necks as Dad is walking them
and the scene of the hero locking himself in a room just to have the
lights on behind him turn on and a very old man and a very young girl
stand up the old man says to the hero of the movie..HAVE YOU MET

It is a very twisted horror fest that has a very dark side. It is a cross with zombie movies and Cronenberg's Rabid. The story is very believable and the gore is over the top for it's time. I can't believe that no one wanted to produce this movie when Cronenberg originally wrote it. This one is a must see for all Cronenberg fans!!!!,1188691200,,466,4.021505376344086
965750,5,6305090343,"The first feature film to come from visionary director David Cronenberg, Shivers still manages to pack enough shocks and social commentary under it's horiffic story to make it relevant today.  When invading parasites begin to infest and turn their human hosts into depraved and violent sexual predators, the few uneffected in a high rise apartment building do what they can to survive.  Low budget to it's core and primitive in it's presentation, Shivers packs a punch thanks to Cronenberg's inventive and groundbreaking story.  Heavy with metaphor and bearing many resemblances to Night of the Living Dead (particularly the final scenes when all the infected band together as a pack), Shivers ends up proving to be a wildly twisted and blood soaked beginning from one of the most innovative directors to come out of the genre in the past few decades.  If you've never seen Shivers and are a Cronenberg fan, try to check it out if you can find it; you won't be disappointed, and you'll get to see one of the true modern masters of the horror genre display some early brilliance.",1171497600,,1078,4.8743169398907105
965751,5,6305090343,"Like all ultra-luxury urban high-rises, and every single square inch of Manhattan real estate, the Starliner Towers has a problem: a Bug problem.

Shot on a shoestring budget and in a whirlwind 15 days in Montreal, ""Shivers"" (also known as ""They Came from Within"") is Canadian horror visionary and all-around Creepy Guy David Cronenberg's astounding, jaw-dropping little gem about the end of the world, in which humanity doesn't go out with a Bang or a Whimper, but more of a Moan.

But let's get something out of the way right now: David Cronenberg is a genius and, for my money, one of the top 3 horror film directors *ever*. And while it's certainly useful to view ""Shivers"" as a preview of coming attractions---without a doubt, it's amazing what the young Cronenberg was able to pull off under severe budgetary, time, and talent limitations---the movie stands on its own as a ground-breaking little nugget of unflinching grue that burrows under your skin and truly disturbs.

Things break down quickly in ""Shivers"", which is about a medical experiment gone horribly wrong, and the terrible toll it takes on the residents of a luxury island apartment complex outside Montreal---and from there the world.

The film's mad scientist (a nice turn by Fred Doederlein, who pops up again as the yoga master in ""Scanners"") wants to produce designer parasites that can be introduced into a body, devour a failing organ, and 'become' that organ, thus helping its host at the cost of a little blood.

But wouldn't ya know it, his first experiment Annabelle(a fetching Kathy Graham) refuses to play along with the Doc's good intentions, chiefly because the parasite has two complications: 1)within a few hours it turns its victim's mind to mush, and 2)it also has the unfortunate side-effect of making the subject a ravening sexual psychopath.

In the fim's shocking opening sequences, the Good Doctor brutally tries to abort his little extracurricular activity, but Annabelle has been a popular girl around the Starliner apartments, and faster than you can say ""sick building syndrome"" the little parasites, which look like a phallic combination of extra-large garden slug and Jimmy Dean sausage, are going a-roving through the apartment building in search of victims.

And faster than the tenants can say ""the check's in the mail"", they've been converted into a legion of slug-infested serial rapists looking for love in all the wrong places.

It may very well have been that Cronenberg's limitations forced him to adopt a style that was so sterile, brutal, and overlit that the film couldn't help being brutal and startling: from an infected old woman groaning from behind her door to a startled delivery man ""I'm hungry...for LOVE"", to an avid slug crawling up an elderly lady's walker, to the horrible death of Dr. Lenski, to the wicked elevator infection scene, to the part where screen goddess Barbara Steele is infected by one of the nasty parasites *in her bathtub* (ewww!), Cronenberg keeps up the pressure and ratchets the horror level up so high you feel your brain will pop. You haven't seen ghoulishly creepy until you've watched Allan Colman pleading and talking with a nest of parasites that have been setting up shop in his stomach. Grisly stuff.

Technically this is an average DVD. It could very well be that the movie was shot in a 1:33:1 aspect ratio, in which case the full-screen format is appropriate, but the sound here is atrocious. The extras here, including a theatrical trailer and an illuminating, goofy interview with Cronenberg, are pretty spare, so let's hope someone gets around to releasing this creepshow with the quality treatment it deserves.

Yes, ""Shivers"" foreshadows a deliciously cringe-inducing career---but for sheer skin-crawling nastiness, it has yet to be surpassed.

965752,3,6305090343,"What I feel is one of the strongest points of this film is it's ambiguous use of fear and horror. Though it seems obvious that the parasites are to be feared in the film, what's even more terrifying is that the creatures are not the source of the ""sex-plague"", they only destroy our own inhibition, letting the hidden monster, that is in us all, free. Add to this, the parasite's conception and you have a great homage to Frankenstein, as well as an interesting spin on the modern Zombie movie. Being Cronenberg's first film, and for its low budget and quick shooting schedule I think the film does a great job of suspending disbelief with interesting ""slight of hand"" special effects. I also think it's an interesting precursor to George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, both of which play off of fears of isolation and self sufficiency. I also feel that the moral of the film sidesteps abstinence, which most sexual horror seems to center on, and goes further to comment on loyalty and self control. My favorite scene by far involves a waiter who is munching down cherries jubilee while lustfully attacking two women.",1112572800,2,1113,4.712820512820513

You know the symptons and when someone starts displaying sexual promiscuity you don't know if they are infected or normal. It's fun finding out! And if someone is attacked, you don't know if they escaped or were infected! A great suspense drama!

Most Erotic Strip Ever!!: I would like to thank the writer/Director for including the Most Erotic Strip Scene I have ever seen in a movie! The scene where the Nurse changes from her uniform into her plain clothes in front of her boyfriend must be the most erotic film scene I have ever seen! She is obviously parading for the Doctor (her boyfriend ) in front of him, while he is talking on his phone! First she undresses and then dresses again in front of him! He is trying to talk science on his phone, while watching his girlfriend undress!

He wrote it as well and it's a great, pulpy, horror film for late nights. Truly distrubing at times, but funny at others. Gruesome though. THE REASON TO GET THIS IS THE CRONENBERG INTERVIEW AFTER THE CREDITS. He talks about all of the pertinent stuff concerning the film that anyone would want to know and it also gives a face to the man in case you thought he might look and sound like a serial killer. He's a pretty normal looking, and sounding guy.  Very educated as well.",1082419200,2,586,4.4766355140186915
965755,5,6305090343,"There is no doubt in my mind, by watching/reading many interviews with David Cronenberg & viewing everything that he has created thus far that David is a ""very special boy"".  Cronenberg has the kind of imagination, lunacy, & repression to really create the kind of visuals in films that once you view them, you never forget.  Cronenberg's 1st feature film, ""Shivers"", does just that.  Filmed on a shoestring budget during 15 hectic days of production in Canada, this film tells the story of a doctor/madman that develops a parasite to live in human beings, take over their intelligence, morals (social & spiritual) & of course, their physical body, & transforms them into oversexed, libertine, bi-sexual cretin beings.
The film is set in and on an exclusive & elite island compound in Canada.  The compound has everything one would ever need.  A grocery, a drugstore, tennis courts, olympic sized swimming pool, doctor's & dentist offices, room service.  The compound includes everything that your little heart desires, plus an extra surprise of parasites roaming in air vents, plumbing, & elevators that resemble a strange cross between a giant,slimy garden slug, a small phallic symbol and a smokey-link breakfast sausage.
This is definitely a catastrophic/end of the world type movie because as the film and the parasites progress to all the inhabitants of the island, there really is only one conclusion...
Of course, I won't give away the ending, but for anyone who enjoys films like Night Of The Living Dead, Outbreak, Dawn Of The Dead, 28 Days, or genre films that feature zombies/animals/mutants/disease taking over the entire world, you will enjoy this movie.

965756,4,6305090343,"Every once in awhile I like to watch a David Cronenberg film. I have seen several at this point, from his earliest stuff like ""Rabid"" to his seminal reworking of ""The Fly"" starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. One thing you will always get from a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's films embrace a synthesis of man and machine that is exceedingly grim, an outlook usually complimented with generous helpings of gore. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind always leads them charging into experiments despite the risks. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs or messing around with human genetics may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. ""Shivers"" is Cronenberg's first major motion picture, and it is quite an auspicious beginning for the Canadian director. This film isn't great, not compared to some of Cronenberg's later magnum opuses, but it showed just enough promise to merit attention from Hollywood.
It's the wonderful 1970s in ""Shivers,"" a time when fancy high-rise residences went up offering prospective tenants all the amenities. The Starliner, an apartment building situated on an isolated island somewhere in Canada, is one of these luxurious projects. The building offers everything for modern living--including a parasite that turns people into raving sex maniacs. Yep, you heard right. ""Shivers"" is about a bunch of poor souls undergoing painful invasions from nasty looking creatures that feed off their host in particularly vicious ways. The problem starts when a quack seeking funding for a radical new medical procedure experiments with the idea of replacing failed organs with an engineered parasite that will take over a particular organ's function. He introduces his repulsive creation into the body of a young girl living in the Starliner with the intention of monitoring how well his idea works, but things quickly go awry. It turns out that this young lady is quite popular with many of the male residents in the building, leading to the rapid spread of the parasite. At first nothing much happens to those people infected with the bug. There might be a fit or two of coughing, a general lethargy might set in, but after a few hours the psychoses set in. When it does, it is already much too late to stop the nightmare from spreading through the Starliner. Women, men, children--no one is immune from the horrific effects of this parasite.
The hero of ""Shivers"" is the physician at the Starliner, a man with little idea of the horrors he will soon combat as the parasite infects his patients. Aided by his loyal nurse (played by Lynn Lowry), the doctor soon finds himself hunted down by the insane residents as the late stages of the infection set in. The best plan of action is to get out of the building, which isn't as easy as it sounds since the Starliner purposely set out to provide an isolated atmosphere for its tenants. Throw in packs of ravenous loonies prowling the vast corridors of the building looking for fresh meat, and you can see the complications inherent in a run for freedom. The doctor must shoot and bludgeon to death several of his former patients just to stay alive for a few more minutes. As his panic grows, as his movements through the madhouse become increasingly erratic, he witnesses one nightmare after another. His nurse falls prey to the parasite, he sees children panting and crawling about like dogs, and he encounters a father and daughter in a mind-shattering situation. The conclusion to the film is what you would expect from a Cronenberg film--bleak, with little hope for a positive outcome.
You can tell ""Shivers"" is low budget fare, but Cronenberg uses what he has to great effect. The central idea of the film, that modern people seeking isolation from the larger population will fall flat on their faces, works because it doesn't require big budget set pieces. Heck, the director didn't even need big stars. Joe Silver, who did a turn in the director's next film appears here as a doctor on the outside who learns about the infection and pays a bloody price for his knowledge. Barbara Steele plays a small part as a single woman named Betts. The rest of the cast is unfamiliar but effective. Sure, some of the effects are slightly cheesy, the editing isn't all that great, but this movie stays with you. You can almost hear some Hollywood big shot saying to Cronenberg after watching the film, ""Yeah, this part could have been better. Yeah, you should have done this instead of that. But kid, you got promise and we're going to keep an eye on you."" Let's be thankful someone gave Cronenberg a chance to follow up on ""Shivers.""
I thought the DVD edition of the film was good. There's a twenty-one minute interview with Cronenberg where the director talks about his film experiences. I thought he came off as funny and self-effacing, explaining how he knew almost nothing about what a director did on a bigger budget film, how he had to help an actress prepare for crying scenes by slapping her face, and his experiences with Barbara Steele. His recollections concerning his panic over getting shots right should reassure beginning filmmakers that the only way to improve as a director is to dive right in. This interview serves as a sort of mini-commentary for the film and I appreciated its inclusion on the disc. Give ""Shivers"" a shot if you like horror movies.",1076371200,4,5656,4.85005170630817

Immediately we see her being strangled to death by a doctor who then proceeds to cut her open and put highly caustic acids to kill whatever it is that is inside of her.

These sequences will set you up for the rest of the film. It seems almost eerie how the philosophy works and how deranged they can be at times.

It comes to the stage that there are those who have it outnumber those who haven't and it's more or less just a fight for survival
I won't say more as I feel I might have given too much away but I got this movie a few years back in a second hand shop since at the time anything with Cronenberg was an instantly bought on my part ( I still do the same now but I've got nearly everything ) and when I put this on I felt the same way those trying to survive do.

David Cronenberg, that crazy Canadian with a penchant for serving up icy-cold cross-sections of sexual obsession and a delirously deviant outlook on the claustrophobic world around him, has a surgeon's precision of taking the filmmaking medium and, like no one since Kubrick of the '60s and early '70s, turns moviemaking into a perfectly symmetrical, an almost clinical form of teaching us that the human race is flawed, and, for the most part, genuinely frightening.
SHIVERS was Cronenberg's first dive into the process of creating motion pictures and the flick made a big enough splash to secure his career as a major force in filmmaking. The movie goes by a myriad of titles:  ""They Came From Within,"" the aptly titled ""The Parasite Murders,"" but for this DVD edition they stuck with SHIVERS, which I believe (don't quote me on this) is the title originally picked for American distribution. The film was written by Cronenberg, who had to fight to direct the picture himself. It was made under the close scrutiny of Ivan Reitman, fellow Canadian and a filmmaker in his own right, who crafted true film gems (Ghostbusters) and unholy messes (Junior). SHIVERS was made for zilch and stars the one and only love of my life... Barbara Steele.
The plot centers around a condo complex located on an isolated island inhabited by swinging seventies fashion and haircuts. It seems a mad scientist and renter has concocted a plan to use giant mutated parasites as replacements for organs in the human body, thus turning something that feeds off people into something that could sustain life for people.
Is this a good plan? Well, maybe on paper, but so was communism. Needless to say, the doctor finds out too late that the little varmints actually unlock the Id in folks, turning them into slaves of their own sexual passion and reckless violence. They work like VD, spreading thoughout the swinging patrons of the place, taking over the complex one person at a time. Yes, the parasites are an antidote to the freewheeling, free-loving disco era.
Is SHIVERS a great film? No, not really. It is a sturdy horror B-movie that makes the most of a meager budget and green cast of actors. The next film Cronenberg did, entitled RABIB (also available on DVD) is basically a rehash of the plot starring the one and only love of my life, Porn Star MARILYN CHAMBERS! RABID shares a similar theme with SHIVERS, a better budget, and a wiser director.
But, for all of you Cronenberg fans, this is a must.
The DVD format of this film is letterboxed and offers a better print than I have ever seen of the movie. It also contains a short-but-sweet interview segment with David Cronenberg, and has a trailer or two. THERE IS NO COMMENTARY though, which is a cardinal sin in my book.

965835,2,6305090343,"Although being an admirer of this Canadian director (who I rank next to  Ingmar Bergman as the most important of all movie directors),  ""Shivers"", his commercial debut, is more interesting as an  exercise of an upcoming talent. The Acting is TERRIBLE, and the  mis-en-scene insecure, to say the least. Except for two or three  overwhelming sequences (the murder/suicide opening scene, and the  confrontation between Joe Silver and Paul Hampton), it's more interesting  to see ""Shivers"" as a child of its time. The gore sequences are  truly disgusting in the style of 70s horror cinema, although hardly as  effective as contemporary films of George Romero and Tobe Hooper (whose  careers declined later). (It's funny to remember Cronenberg's statement,  that he sees no link to Romero's films - just compare ""Shivers""  with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Rabid"" with  ""The Crazies"" for once!) Some European director's left quite an  impression on Cronenberg, too, especially Bunuel and Pasolini. This  ""underground feel"" (improvised acting, raw directing, surreal  violence in combination) makes ""Shivers"" look pathetic - as it  doesn't quite work - and dated, but one should be forgiving, I suppose,  regarding the 15 days of actual filming. Still, there is a profound  seriousness behind the images, which finally made it to the screen  successfully with ""The Brood"" (4 years later), Cronenberg's first  true masterpiece, and still my favourite of his efforts to this day.",968025600,,1474,5.294372294372295

I like his movies because he deals with horror on a very  personal and intimate level--the ghoulies that come to get you don't rise  from the dead, they're not cartoon-type monsters or mad slashers, they're  your neighbors, your family (unfortunately, that parallels real life  sometimes!)...and Cronenberg's interest in the exaggeration of bodily  afflictions, diseases and invasions makes for very unsettling, effective  viewing (nearly every horror movie he's made, but especially stuff like  Rabid, Videodrome, Dead Ringers, eXistenz [however you spell it])...As you  know, this is the movie where an evil professor implants a young coed with  a parasite that is ""part aphrodisiac, part venereal disease"" in  the name of freeing man from his rational mind; he should act more on  impulse, especially the sexual kind.  Of course, the coed sleeps around and  passes the slug-like parasite around this island community near Montreal.  After the parasite invades the body (by either entering orifices or burning  its way in), victims feel a mixture of gut-wrenching sickness and unabated  sexual desire.  So, soon the entire apartment complex is infected, and as  the movie ends (I don't think I'm giving anything away here to those who  are familiar with this genre), the diseased pack leaves their protective,  insulated world to continue to spread the stuff ever onward.  I find it  fascinating that in the heyday of ""do what feels good"" someone  would be as prescient as this young director to rail (in the movie, at  least) against this concept.  Sex, in this movie is treated as not  desirable, but repulsive and horrifying, and the odd thing is, take away  the parasite creatures, and you're not really that far removed from the  desires and fantasies of some people; you see the spectrum of perversion  (allusions to pedophilia, incest, orgies) underneath the surface of the  respectable world. I suppose this was the point; it's very convincing and  realistic, despite the sometimes wooden acting and occasional unintentional  hilarious line.  Low production values add to the effect, though in  general, this is not a badly directed film (Cronenberg says in an  after-movie interview that he started out knowing nothing, but learned fast  on the job)--in fact, all things considered, it's quite good.  It's another  one of those 70s movies that are thoroughly immersed in the culture and  make for a good document of the times, though it of course can just be  enjoyed as a good scare, too.

In short, David Cronenberg's peculiar concern is the human  corpse. And its hidden secrets. So no wonder if the hero of SHIVERS is  already a doctor. In fact, the man responsible for the horrors depicted in  this movie is also a doctor. Good and Evil, Pain and Pleasure, SHIVERS is a  study of these dualities which make the world turn round.
During the  interesting interview of David Cronenberg that you can see as bonus  feature, the director presents SHIVERS as a truly original horror movie.  Well, I don't quite agree with him. It's impossible not to think of George  Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Don Siegel's INVASION OF THE BODY  SNATCHERS as you watch this movie. But, let's be fair, it could be  considered as an homage to these two classics.
SHIVERS has its moments of  pure horror and very comic moments (specially when children are involved,  congratulations for your good taste, David) considering the subject of the  movie. I must admit that just the simple idea to have living parasites in  my body makes me uneasy, but to imagine that they could grow and take  control of my mind is terrifying. Happily enough, David Cronenberg is a  Hitchcock's pupil and often let's the audience imagine the worse by  suggesting rather than by showing it.
In the first part of the movie,  parasites are very aggressive until they've taken control of a sufficient  number of bodies. Then, and THAT is genuinely original, they will try to  win by using the sexual pulsions of the building's inhabitants. See at  least once SHIVERS for the dionysiac orgies that follow.
Average audio  and video. A featurette and a trailer.
A DVD to swallow.",956534400,8,1801,4.798045602605863
965908,4,6305090343,"This film is a weird cross between the original ""Invation of the body snatchers"" and ""Alien"" with lots of sexual paranoia thrown in for good measure. Here is ""Alien"" 4 years before the real  thing hit the screen. Look for the stomach crawl effects and jumping,  burning slugs. There is some really bad acting but the writer/director  takes the material to the limits in an interesting way. I originally saw  the film in the late 70s on the big screen and some of the scenes stayed  with me over the years. Great to (finally?) have it available on tape.",952041600,,552,4.5353535353535355
965909,2,6305090343,"I became a big fan of Cronenberg after renting Naked Lunch and Videodrome, and I started buying his movies. Then I bought this movie, and I wish I hadn't.  The problem may have been that I expected Shivers to be an  extremely high quality movie like the two aforementioned movies, but it is  not.  It is, in my opinion, a run of the mill B horror movie.  It is  bloody, and has Cronenberg's characteristic sexual content but after  watching it once I knew that I wasn't going to be watching it again for a  LONG time. I found myself laughing at it more than anything.  If you are  one who finds these movies amusing for comic relief, you'll probably like  this movie more than I did.  It is worth seeing once, but I wish I would  have just rented this movie instead of buying it.",951955200,2,779,4.289655172413793

965911,4,6305090343,"I bumped into this on cable tonight and was very impressed.  This is ideal deadtime viewing.  I'm no horror groupie, and those few I've enjoyed seem to be quite slow-moving with the viewer not on man or the monster's side,  but rather bewteen the two, quietly uring on the the camera's dark fancy  (Dawn of the Dead, Nosferatu).  I was curious to see who directed it and  wasn't surprised to see Cronenberg's name in the credits (the blonde slavic  looker must have been sculpted from an identical mould to that of James  Spader's spouse in Crash).  I thought he made very nice use of what felt  like a standard style of horror cinematography (as well a hint of Tarkovsky  and Solaris), mixing into this formula a twist in the standard attacking  parasite that drew a striking case for the erotic underpinnings of tension  and sensuality that underline the allure of blood and death and the  occasional flesh eating slug.
I haven't got a clue what the dvd of this  is like, but I'm tempted to say go with vhs on this one.  The visuals don't  exactly call out for the most refined quality of picture.  No need to take  my advice, but why pass up the chance to get it on a format destined for a  history of whose charms we will probably recognize as quite in keeping with  those of movies like Shivers.  This one also has a better cover so no  excuse really.",951696000,,1356,4.444897959183673

The picture is lame and the sound is just awful. I have great  equipment (TV, stereo surround, etc.) and then I see this! I know the movie  is from 1970 and low-budget, but there should have been some  ""bump-up"" in sound quality, at the very least, for the DVD  release.",948931200,,426,4.2875
965913,4,6305090343,"I love this disturbing and entertaining film.  I too, noticed the pixelization and artifacting on the DVD expecially in the beginning moments of the film.  I'll get the LD for good measure. In respect, this is  Cronenberg's champion starter. How scary the idea of parasites and disease  and utter chaos relate to current events. Notice there is hardly any  characters to ""root for"" apart from the bewieldered doctor on the  premesis.  This film cannot be called cliched, that's for sure.  Interestingly, Cronenberg's open casting call (and subsequent hiring of  non-professional actors) really compliments this film - they act like the  tenants of any apartment building. Scary?  It depends on what you find  scary - of course, I'm absolutely terrified of any woman who comes pounding  and scratching on my door with over-done make-up and lusting after food!  Entertaining?  You betcha. Most highly recommended.",946339200,2,911,5.2727272727272725

I suggest buying the VHS version from Anchor Bay  instead...clear, crisp and perfect.  IMAGE ENT should take more care in  their DVD releases if they want to compete with the majors.

It has the usuals that you would expect from this director: lots of sexually oriented material and  wierdness. I did enjoy this movie, but mostly because it was silly and easy  to laugh at.  The acting is poor, and the plot is your usual Cronenberg  wierdness.  It has the feel of many of the zombie movies, altough with sex  instead of explicit gore (ie. Zombie, Day of the Dead, Night of the Living  Dead, etc).  If you like Cronenberg movies, this is a must see.

I had it on my wish list (and the alternate title, ""It Came From Within"" or whatever) for YEARS, waiting for it to be re-released in some form or fashion.
Imagine my delight when just recently, I saw it was re-released, and several formats.  Luckily I checked my ""On Demand"" search on my cable-TV subscription, because it was there too, for me to watch before purchasing.
What a disappointment.  I know it was made on a low budget, and so the setting is all the same and confined: All pretty much within the confines of an apartment building or nearby.  But it really is boring to see the same settings, scene after scene.  And it's just not very exciting, interesting or scary. It plods along, with not much happening, and then when something does occur, it's pretty underwhelming.",1508457600,,973,4.633720930232558

7882763,4,6305090343,". . . SHIVERS (1975) echoes with the depravity of a bottled up adolescent let loose with a building, a modest budget and a grudge against a sterile society.

Legend says that this was the film that got Cronenberg evicted from his apartment because when his landlady discovered that her tenant had made this notorious film she invoked a sub-clause forbidding the production of pornography by her tenants. But is SHIVERS pornography?

While SHIVERS may present evidence of a sort of prurient interest in sex I argue that the film reflects a concept of sex that has been so distorted by a fear of eroticism that SHIVERS cannot be labeled pornographic. Prurient loathing abounds as does the message that sex is not only fearsome and disgusting but that it is also inevitable.

The film opens with a sterile voice that describes the amenities in an equally sterile apartment complex which is to be the setting for what follows. Theses early moments have the feel of a barely legitimate shockumentary. Nothing about this introduction is warm, cozy or inviting and so we can credit the imaginary advertisers for not employing any deceptive marketing practices here.

Next we see a middle aged, Freudian looking man break into an apartment where a young androgynous looking person lounges in a the uniform of a student from a private high school. The balding man proceeds to strangle the young person who we learn is female only by the panties that are exposed beneath her skirt as well as the breasts that are eventually exposed beneath her blouse. The assault is violent in a vrit style. There is no music or stylish editing. I would compare the scene to something as frank and graphic as our main droog Alex is forced to vidie during his mind bending treatments in Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971). Whether or not this similarity was intentional this is quite a sportsmanlike choice of introductory scenes by Cronenberg. If a viewer cannot stomache what is happening here then that viewer does not stand any chance of surviving the eighty-five minutes that are ahead.

As if to emphasize this the Freudian man, after subduing the young girl, placed her on a table where he slices open her abdomen and fills her inside with some corrosive chemical before turning the scalpel on himself and slicing his own throat. It is impossible to say at this early stage whether the man has killed himself out of guilt over what he has done or to escape some horror that he and he alone knows is coming.

Continuing with our theme of ""explicitness . . . ""

Cronenberg cuts right to the chase in the scenes that follow where we meet a scientific researcher who, while munching in a pickle, describes what the rogue scientist from our earlier scene has done, which is to create a combination aphrodisiac-disease, a parasite that introduces itself to the body of the host and brings with It an insatiable carnal lust that provokes orgies of copulation in all who have been infected. Zombies have never had things so good nor have audiences of gore and bloody horror. The exposition in this scene that informs the viewer of what is happening is the most unromantic expository sequence that I have ever seen, the narrative equivalent of walking up to a man in a gay bar and saying ""let's f@&k"" and, like the direct approach in the gay bar, nobody is offended by this bluntness. On the contrary, the bluntness yields results.

From here the middle of the film begins. Less we grow comfortable or even accepting of the idea of a frigid society defrosted by an accelerated and (mostly) mutual sexual urge Cronenberg reminds the audience as certainly he has been endlessly reminded himself that sex is not an appropriate activity for decent people and as such the blessed disease is transferred from host to host by a bloody, writhing relentless organism that is somewhere between a phalus and a turd. Cronenberg fans will recognize the nasty little bugger as a smaller version of that which Cronenberg himself pulls out of Gina Davis a decade later in THE FLY (1986). God bless the man for having a sense of continuity.

All of Cronenberg's narrative cornercutting means that the rest of the ride is grotesque from wall to wall though the pace of the opening sequence is difficult to sustain. Those who are already squirming in their seats will be relieved to see the familiar face of Horror Goddess Barbara Steele in these early goings but before we have the chance to wrap our imaginations in the motherly security of her robes she too is taken from us by the merciless disease and turned into a sexually ravenous beast that sadly any healthy person would regard as repulsive and completely unf@&kable.

Fans of the zombie genre and DAWN OF THE DEAD in particular will not find anything akin to the heroic mankind versus the apocalypse stand that happens in the shopping mall of that film. While the uninflected do resist there is a sense that once the initial reluctance to the ugly physical transformation takes place the actual condition itself is not so bad. For once people are following through with that long neglected pledge to get to know their neighbors better.

No, SHIVERS is not quite pornography. While the idea of a communicable condition that promotes sexual interface among neighbors is a decidedly pornographic scenario the way that the idea is realized is aimed at provoking revulsion and disgust. If Cronenberg is saying something about the need for societal restrain in our sexual urges is unclear. There is always the chance that he was absorbed in some post-adolescent prank of offering a horny audience a sex film like no other and then laughing maniacally while a horror film like no other plays out before their eyes.

For the full realization of this effect the audience would preferably be strapped down with eyes wide open like Alex during the infamous Ludovico Technique, but Cronenberg does not need to pilage Kubrick's bag of tricks here. Though all viewers of SHIVERS may not yet be convinced, Cronenberg is a genius by his own design.  (Four out of a possible five stars)",1506643200,,6091,4.80611270296084
