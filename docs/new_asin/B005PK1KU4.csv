And now that it's on DVD, I'm so excited just like another reviewer stated that she is throwing her an ALL GIRL""S night out, I'm doing same with me and my friends girls. This is David E.

4856604,5,B005PK1KU4,This play is easily my favorite of all of Mr. David E. Talbert's! He's a genius in the way he can incorporate so many different emotions into one 2-hour production. WELL DONE! This DVD is AMAZING!,1320105600,3,196,4.472222222222222

4856608,4,B005PK1KU4,"i loved this movie, but of course i love all of david talberts movies and plays. it kept me wondering what was going to happen and when they were going to get caught.",1329523200,,166,4.0606060606060606
4856609,3,B005PK1KU4,"I saw this play live in DC @ the Warner Theatre.  Overall the play was okay, but there were some areas within the play that I felt the sexual connotation was just too much.  Don't want to give too much of the story line away in this review, but overall a good watch.  Not good to watch if children are around, but good to watch if you're snowed in or on a Sunday washing clothes after church.  Enjoy.",1328140800,2,400,4.089743589743589
4856610,5,B005PK1KU4,David Talbert has done it again!! I loved this play immensely. I highly recommend this to everyone!! Pick this up please!! You will not be disappointed.,1327449600,,152,4.884615384615385
4856611,4,B005PK1KU4,"I liked this play, but some of the acting was way over the top and exagerrated to me. However, it pulled itself together near the end. I'm a fan of David E Talbert, so I will continue to support his plays and read his books. My question to him is, when are you going to bring a play to Charleston, WV?",1326758400,2,301,3.9508196721311477
4856612,5,B005PK1KU4,This play kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was very shocked to see how this one was playing out. Very electrifying!,1326067200,,131,3.888888888888889
4856613,4,B005PK1KU4,"I of course have seen all of Tyler Perry's plays and absolutely love them, I stumbled across ""Love in the Nick of Tyme"" and watched it one evening and really enjoyed it. This play had just been released as well so I decided to grab it. This play is really good. I enjoyed the story of it and the twists that Talbert displays at the end. Of the 2 plays I have seen of him, they both were romance or marriage related. So I'm assuming that is his favorite genre.

Video quality on this was really good, I really really enjoyed the amount of detail on the stage play, and the lighting, and camera scenes that was used. The DVD layout is really nice and fancy as well.

The singing in here is pretty awful in my opinion. It's more of a sound issue to me than a actor issue. The sound just isn't there, the music drowns out the person to me, and I can't feel the song as much as you should be able to. Maybe they needed background singers or something. But Michelle Williams voice is just way to chipmunkish for me. I LOVED HER SONG, but just not her singing it. Character Moody was not as funny as he should have been, when you see the character it just makes you laugh so hard, but thats about the only laugh you will get from him. My last small complaint is that there is SO MUCH SEXUAL INNUENDO. Like cmon, it's funny and cool at first, but it just never ends. I'm not even a church going person, but cmon talbert, grow up some. (Actor jacking off a shotgun to imitate masturbation....)

Anyway, Love in the Nick of Tyme is alot better IMO, I can still say I will check out some more Talbert plays in the future, and some of his old ones that I have not seen. At 20 years in doing this, he may have fell off with his primes being some of the older plays, So i'll check them out first.",1325894400,2,1782,4.114942528735632
4856614,3,B005PK1KU4,"This version is good, but I did go and see the play live when it toured Dallas, TX.  In that live version
the character parts were switched a bit because Morris Chestnut played the part that Clifton Davis plays in this video version and Clifton played the dad.  Also in the live version, another actor (who did a splendid job) played the part that Brian White plays.

Nevertheless.. I still enjoy this video version. I would actually give it a 3 1/2 or 3 3/4, but the ratings don't allow for fractions.  It's ALMOST a 4 though.  Too bad the video version couldn't have included BOTH
Morris AND Brian!  :)",1325721600,,604,4.445454545454545
4856615,5,B005PK1KU4,"David E Talbert does it again, fantastic stage play. I seen it live and enjoyed it all over again when it came out on DVD.",1324771200,2,122,3.92
4856616,3,B005PK1KU4,i just saw this on bet the other night. it's an alright play. michelle williams never really had a great voice and seeing her in this play just confirmed it. the acting was ok. the funniest person that made the play was the girl that played michelle's best friend. i would recommend just for the message in it.,1324252800,,310,4.362068965517241
4856617,5,B005PK1KU4,"We just watched this on bet and wow, we just also placed our order for this movie earlier today before we knew it was coming on bet today. So we are so happy that we ordered this movie.. This was so good! We own several of David E Talbert's other plays which we love..

So now we really can not wait until we receive this play in the mail as we want to watch this over again. The plot was so awesome and so was the singing and acting.. We could not get enough of this play..

Well if you don't purchase this one, you will miss out.. This play was made and performed with such excellence.

Waiting on our's in the mail!

******Update******12/21/2011
Whew we have watched this play over so many times! That I had to come back and make an update... We are so enjoying the quality of this play. I love the message, the acting, the scenes and as far as the singing goes, I can not complain. I think Michelle Williams did as well as she was going to do. Maybe acting is more of her talent (All I know is that the song make me your number one, I would love to have that song on an album with Michelle Williams as the artist of the song. That song was so awesome and she did an excellence job!).

Over all, if you miss this play just because of the singing, you will miss out on the message, and the talent of David E Talbert. This will make a great gift, I wish that I would have ordered more.. But now I have a great gift idea, along with a great movie night for couples and just a girls movie night.

The emotions in this play are so reality, and I love the way that this play delivers the wisdom of the elders... Whew! This play even has some suspense in it and twist and flips.... The humor is also great.. For some good family entertainment, you can not ask for more.. I did not want the play to end!
We support this play and will continue to support his work..

The behind the scenes bonus features is also awesome and worth viewing. For me this play was and is reality... How often do you see beautiful African American couples successful and playing roles that are not full of violence... And as far as Moody... Whew bring it on... Keep Moody in the plays, We would love to see him and this whole cast in a sequel or just another subject matter with this very talented cast. Ann Nesby.. Whew....... How can anyone say anything negative about this play with all this great talent! Keep up the excellence that you so bring in all of your plays!

We now have all of his books and all of his plays except for the ones that have not been released. Keep up the great work and thanks for providing good family entertainment! Keep them coming!

Just in time for the holidays or anytime! So happy we placed this order! So much talent! Watch this with your husband and watch the forgiveness, temptation, strife, lessons, the time not spent at home, and the redemption, the storms of relationships.. this is reality... look at the divorce rate in the African American community we marry less but have the highest divorce rate.. (something to think about).....The grass is not greener on the other side... as it has to be mowed and trimmed just as well and it also is dormant during seasons and it withers, so if you want some powerful lessons, great music... This is for you! i mean the music has Brent Jones how could you not like what Brent Jones puts out...and many more music talents!

This play is great food for thought, I would love to see this as a movie!

Now back to more watching over and over, roll on the floor laughs, and inspiration!

Enjoy! We sure are.. Sing Ann Nesby! Michelle Williams! Amen Clifton Powell! Whew!

********6/9/2012****update
We are still watching this and it is still funny, roll on the floor laughs, and entertaining! We have shared this play with our family and they love it as well.. We can not wait on the soundtrack to this play to come out!

Moody is still funny even several months later from when we first saw this play..
If you have not purchased this play, you are missing out.

update 12/26/2012! Still watching! And yes this play is still that great! If you have not seen this play you are missing out! Everyone that I have told about this play loves this play and people who know about this play love this play! I have and can watch this over and over and over it really is that great! Get your copy or copies today! I am waiting on the sound track! Please release the sound track to this play..

Back to more great singing, humor and a beautiful stage set and great acting!",1324166400,,4513,4.297997644287397
4856618,4,B005PK1KU4,"THE PLAY WAS GOOD BUT IT WAS A BRAND NEW PLAY AND IT WAS NOT CHEAP AND IT SKIPED ON ME.RIGHT WHEN HER MOTHER WAS TELLING HER ABOUT THE STORY OF GOING IN A GROCERY STORE HUNGRY.IT WAS A REAL MESSAGE IN THAT ,I THINK BECAUSE EVERY TIME I TRYIED TO CLEAN MY DVD AND HEAR IT IT ALWAYS SKIPED I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HEAR WHAT HER MOTHER TOLD HER.BUT BESIDES THAT LITTLE PROBLEM I LIKED IT.",1323734400,,383,3.923076923076923
4856619,5,B005PK1KU4,"As a fellow playwright, I tend to watch plays more critically than others so it gives me great pleasure to say that this is an all around great play! The plot and the twist are perfect and the set, OMG amazing. Absolutely loved it. Mr. Talbert did a bang up job on this one, as he always do.",1323388800,,291,4.0344827586206895
4856620,5,B005PK1KU4,I missed this play when it came to my city.  I was so happy to learn that the DVD was being released.  Enjoyed it so much that I am inviting some girlfriends over for a girls night out to watch it again.,1323302400,,203,3.8095238095238093
4856621,5,B005PK1KU4,"I don't know about you but I love a good play. I must give David E. Talbert his props. He really out done himself with this one. If you don't own it I suggest you purchase it now while supplies last. If you miss out
; shame on you.",1323216000,,231,3.7346938775510203
4856622,5,B005PK1KU4,I was on my feet. Outstanding job David E. Talbert and Lyn Talbert. Outstanding. Superior Job.  Child Brian White had me thinking he was crazy for real. Jumping out of pantry. On the floor laughing so hard at all that craziness. When you go to grocery story get what you need.,1322870400,,276,4.411764705882353
4856623,4,B005PK1KU4,Great play! It has a geat message and some funny parts as well as serious side that makes everyone thinks!,1322870400,,106,4.35
4856624,4,B005PK1KU4,"The play was good but I think I expected a little more. Even though it was close to 2 hours long it didn't seem to be filled with much. Plus I would've preferred to see Morris Chestnut on the DVD version. Michelle did good as well and her friend was funny! Overall,  I did get a few laughs and I liked how everything came together at the end.",1322611200,,342,4.029411764705882
4856625,1,B005PK1KU4,I love David E. Talbert plays but this one was very disappointing.  I didn't enjoy this play at all.  I hate I wasted my money on it.  I have never seen Michelle Williams perform in a play before and I won't be rushing out to see her again.  The play needed more humor.  The singing was OK but nothing to talk about.  The old man character was starting to get on my nerves.  Don't waste your money on this one.,1321401600,,410,4.05
4856626,4,B005PK1KU4,I was very happy with my DVD.  It arrived sooner than I expected.  I have all of David's plays so I was glad when I was able to add it to my David E. Talbert Presents collection.,1321228800,,178,3.7837837837837838
4856627,3,B005PK1KU4,"I know there is far more money in the Secular Arena and I am happy some of the Christians do try to attempt to navigate the waters BUT I wish you all would put parental warnings on the dvd's. So while no there is not any explicit language there is explicit sexual conversation. I look for more family oriented plays (like he use to put out) and I am noticing David Talbert has left from his original premise. We all seek expansion but seems this artistic growth is at the expense of our children. Why the scene with the women who could barley walk (reference to her being soar via sex) was included, is beyond me and it was tasteless.

I am a David Talbert fan, this dvd was just not a HIT in my opinion. Michele was a great actor but please next time get someone professional to do her weave. The Senile old man (Moody) character lines were not a fit either..kinda dry and so was the humor of the play. I just expected more judging by his other plays and dvd's.

Additionally, why a cheating wife, who married a rich older man for MONEY, cheats with a plumber, almost kills him, and is reconciled with her husband in the end, is something to be laughed at, is also beyond me. She learned nothing and a black man was killed. The African American community should be tired of seeing that story play out over and over.

This dvd just was not a fan favorite of mine. I still say support it. David Talbert is still a very talented man. I look forward to your other productions.",1320364800,6,1473,4.2913669064748206

8482506,3,B005PK1KU4,"Overall this play was pretty good with great casting.  I really did like Michelle's performance.  Everyone played their part pretty good.  My favorite character was Mr. Wilkinson.  He was downright hilarious.

Now the guy who Michelle cheated with in the play was rather weird.  I usually like Brian White but I did not care for his performance in this play at all.  They actually made Brian look so pathetic.

Other than that, the play was okay and had a good storyline and there were a lot of funny parts to enjoy amongst the cast such as the husband (Clifton Davis) in his reference to Brian's plumbing and him trying to find a woman.  Michelle's mother and Mr. Wilkinson and Michelle's friend.  But Brian's parts ruined it for me.

The play was enjoyable and would be nice to keep in your collection.",1378252800,,804,4.631205673758865

8482512,4,B005PK1KU4,"I purchased David E. Talbert's ""The Fabric of a Man"" dvd subsequent to seeing the live stage play (with Shemar Moore); however, I purchased ""What My Husband Doesn't Know"" without viewing the stage performance first, and I must say, Mr. Talbert did not disappoint. In my opinion, the play was quite entertaining. In fact, I have viewed it several times with family and friends who have enjoyed it as well. I recommend it as a nice addition to one's contemporary gospel play collection.",1333929600,,484,4.843373493975903
