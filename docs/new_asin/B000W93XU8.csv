My rating is for the dvd release from CODE RED. The cheapo dvd release from ""Mutant Sorority Pictures""  is a cheapo dvd release that is in ok quality but the image has been cropped slightly. Spend a few extra bucks and get the code red dvd release which is in superb quality, has two commentary tracks, and interviews.

Also if you love the movie like i do ...don't listen to the commentary track from lead actress Isabelle Mejias. She is excellent in this film but says she hates it and spends the entire 90 minutes just talking sh*t about it. She sounds very bitter about her career and has almost nothing nice to say about anyone or anything. Walt Olsen on the commentary track with her may be be partially to blame since he loves to ask the most ridiculous questions in his annoying Elmer Fudd type accent. Could they really not find someone better for this??? So maybe he helped put her in a bad mood from the get go.

The other commentary track is from co-star Sybil Danning and is interesting BUT she doesn't talk for more than 3 minutes about THIS FILM. Instead David Decoteau (yes that hack) just asked her about her career from A to Z. Eh.

This is a great film that deserves to be better known. The directing, writing, acting, and twists are all well done. I gave it a 10 on imdb and the Code Red release is excellent.",1488758400,2,1348,4.397590361445783

8221821,4,B000W93XU8,"Julie Darling is a gender flipped Night Warning by way of Leave Her to Heaven riff. I mean that as a compliment. It's a creepy movie made creepier by a bad VHS to DVD transfer that makes the film look like a demented home movie.

Isabelle Mejias plays creepy Julie. She likes her dad a lot and enjoys feeding her snake rats way too much. After a home invasion, she finally gets daddy all to herself. Then the unthinkable happens, daddy finds a new mommy complete with a baby brother. It gets psycho sexual and crazy from here.

The performances are all pretty good. Even Sybil Danning is pretty decent as the confused and overwhelmed step mom in peril. It's not a spoiler btw to say that. The movie only gets more wild from there and takes a bunch of turns I wasn't expecting. Isabelle Mejias isn't a great actress but being a bad one helps when playing a creepy loon.

I have to be kinda vague talking about this movie cause it's got a lot of twists I don't want to spoil. It's a solid purchase and is thankfully pretty cheap on Amazon. Well worth picking up if you get the chance.",1472688000,,1082,4.320197044334975

8221824,1,B000W93XU8,Take note that the Synergy release is a bootleg on DVD-R and taken from a VHS. The only legal release is the one coming from film materials released by Code Red DVD. I don't understand why Amazon can sell obvious illegal materials.,1326758400,,231,4.523809523809524
8221825,5,B000W93XU8,"This film is very different and has a lot to do with sexual aspects. That's not what makes it a great film, but the whole story bunches it up together.  5/5 stars, check it out.",1313193600,5,177,4.057142857142857
8221826,4,B000W93XU8,"A suprisingly good (& undeservingly obscure) B-movie gem. Underated canadian actress Isabelle Mejias dominates this thriller as a disturbed young lady who loves her dad a little to much, and will do anything to keep him all to herself. Sybil Danning plays her stepmother & Anthony Fransciosa play her dad. Also known as Bad Blood & Daughter Of Death, and directed by Paul Nicolas (Chained Heat, The Naked Cage) this is far less exploitive than you might think, sort of an '80's ""Bad Seed"". This DVD is only okay, the movie is not remastered, the sound is murky, & no special features, but still worth getting (Cheap!). A lost classic.",1238284800,3,634,4.7727272727272725
