This is a little different than some of his videos, yet I still love it! Starts out with a rock soundtrack this time, and it's funny seeing the producer get a little thrown around in the wind in the beginning. Gorgeous views of the ocean, it makes you feel like you're really there. Also some great shots of the resort Mr Maddy was staying in, along with its breathtaking views. I love Mr Maddy's cinematic style as it makes you feel like you're really there. After seeing this video I felt like I was able to see part of the world that a lot don't. Sure, there's Hawaii and DC which are always exciting to explore, but for Cape Town, a place I might never be able to visit, this comes in as a pretty good plan B. Love love love this video! Especially the Boos who made a couple appearances this round. (Check out his books for more Boos, they're hilarious)",1394755200,,920,4.323699421965318
