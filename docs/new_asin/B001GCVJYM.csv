8304970,2,B001GCVJYM,"Jacobs' ""Nervous System"" performances are fascinating, and recently he has begun preserving them on digital video (until that time, the only way to see these works was to attend performances, and Jacobs rarely performs them outside NYC or experimental film festivals in other major cities). But this disc is does not reflect his best work. The powerful and often surprising depth and other optical effects are not as pronounced here as in other works, the sound/image relationships aren't terribly interesting, and even the packaging is poor (no liner notes, and the DVD itself is very difficult to take out of and put back into the case). One short work is meant to be viewed with a special filter, but the DVD doesn't even come with that (a $0.25 piece of plastic, which admittedly I'll be able to get myself, but still...). The two releases of Jacobs' ""Nervous Magic Lantern"" performances on John Zorn's Tzadik label are a better bet.",1232841600,6,937,4.89937106918239
