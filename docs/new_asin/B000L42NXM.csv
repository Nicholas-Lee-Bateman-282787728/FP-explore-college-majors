8160155,4,B000L42NXM,I bought this DVD awhile ago. I thought the production value was well done and that the content was interesting. There are numerous 2 person exhibitions that allows for a taste of how their arts are practiced. Numerous weapons are practiced on the DVD.,1229904000,,252,4.75
8160156,1,B000L42NXM,"It's okay. It's just a video of the exhibition, which in itself is not quite exciting. It's more a showcase and the martial arts aren't all that unique or different from other countries. Some of them might be interesting to watch but after so many of the similar types, it becomes not quite exciting. I think partly it's the exhibition itself is not that well organized, not the fault of the filmmaker.",1204502400,,402,4.597222222222222
