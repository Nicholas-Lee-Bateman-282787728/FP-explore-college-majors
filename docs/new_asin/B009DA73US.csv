5319491,5,B009DA73US,I love anything I can see about the Titanic.  Contains information I was oblivious of.  I would really recommend this movie.,1355097600,3,124,4.857142857142857
5319502,5,B009DA73US,my grandson is into the titanic. he learned about the 3 ships,1445472000,,61,4.166666666666667
5319503,5,B009DA73US,Excellent! It really does seem like they were cursed.,1444176000,,53,5.0
5319504,1,B009DA73US,"Point of correction!  The editorial review info stating that these ships were sold as unsinkable is factually incorrect.  The White Star Line NEVER claimed that they were unsinkable.  The statement that they were ""practically unsinkable"" came from a scientific journal that reviewed the  new ship Titanic.  Looks like the editorial review failed to fact check their statement!",1437091200,,376,5.526315789473684
5319505,4,B009DA73US,"Documentaries are always good for me.  Since I couldn't be there or read the papers of the time, documentaries are the way to understand what happened in history.",1433462400,,162,4.785714285714286
5319506,4,B009DA73US,Everybody knows the story of the Titanic. I'm still waiting for some cruise lines to tempt fate and launch Titanic II. But very few know about Titanic's equally cursed sisters. The White Star Liners Olympic and Britannic. Both had flawed designs as well. This video will take you from their inception to disaster.,1426636800,,313,4.9245283018867925
5319507,1,B009DA73US,I thought that this would not be so documentary.  Thought maybe there would be more of a movies basis to the DVD.,1426204800,,113,4.136363636363637
5319508,1,B009DA73US,nothing new here folks,1420761600,,22,4.75

5319511,5,B009DA73US,great movie,1413936000,,11,5.0
5319512,3,B009DA73US,"One of those things that pop up on Amazon as ""Customers also bought."" Just a ripoff. Scant, sparse material trying to make a buck off ""Titanic's"" celebrity.",1410998400,,156,4.814814814814815
5319513,5,B009DA73US,Amazing how three ships could have similar fates.,1410480000,,49,5.25
5319514,3,B009DA73US,"For those who are interested in the stories of the TITANIC class vessels but know little of them, they might find this  DVD interesting.  There are some nice underwater shots of the ship BRITTANIC which was a sister ship to Titanic but was sunk in relatively shallow water
and is easy for divers to get to.  Unfortunately most of the interior which was almost identical to the Titanic's interior was removed to make
the ship into a hospital ship.  Still it was interesting to see much of the ships innards which are well preserved though the ship lies on its
side rather than upright.  Some of the info is dated such as how the Titanic sank; here they say a long gash tore into the side of the Titanic,
but we now know rather a series of small gashes after popping the rivets caused the ship to sink,  Overall this disc is very informative, but
I suggest buying other available  DVDs to companion this one.  There are plenty available from Amazon, where I get mine.  Much of the
original woodwork that was removed from the Britannic was saved and put into a hotel I think.  Perhaps one of the other DVDs will show
some of it and tell were it can be seen.  Cost is modest and worth buying.  Enjoy!",1409616000,9,1196,4.386363636363637
5319515,5,B009DA73US,"Has a lot of information on both ships and their history. If your a Titanic fan then you will enjoy learning about her sisters
I know I did.
Sincerely Darren",1402617600,,157,4.266666666666667
5319516,5,B009DA73US,"If you are a Titanic fanatic like me you will thoroughly enjoy it, very informative. I highly recommend the movie.",1391990400,8,114,4.75
5319517,5,B009DA73US,Not much information out there about ALL three ships-you hear a lot about the Titanic but not her other two sisters. Found this interesting.,1390867200,8,140,4.875

5319519,3,B009DA73US,"for a documentary, it was extremely helpful in understanding how the TITANIC (ship) came about that led to it's tragic end.",1361577600,4,123,4.904761904761905
5319520,3,B009DA73US,"While the overall documentary was entertaining, the facts of the 3 White Star giants were either over looked or lacking in substance. The research & production seemed sacrificed to lend the film more drama than it truly needed. As a historian,
staying with the facts would have given this film much more validity.",1359331200,15,313,4.9245283018867925
5319521,5,B009DA73US,This DVD was very interesting but than I can't seem to get enough of Titanic information I just find it facinating.,1358985600,4,115,4.523809523809524

8540211,3,B009DA73US,"It seems to be a documentary.  Although, it may have been knowledge and interviews of persons, it was a sad, sad day in out history.",1486771200,,132,4.28
8540212,5,B009DA73US,"History is not always fun to learn, but the story of titanic we already know, but the sister ships have a wonderful, history filled story of why they sank and how they were made. Even my mother loved it lol. Now if you nave the mother seal of approval you know you have a five stars movie.",1480982400,,289,4.087719298245614
