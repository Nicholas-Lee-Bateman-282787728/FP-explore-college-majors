Video quality is poor.  It is surprising how often Chinese dvds are defective, even for $80. Apparently business plan relies on making money only from disappointed purchasers who don't bother returning them.

PS:  I received a return label and paid about $10 bucks to send it back, using the return label.  However, the post office returned it because of ""insufficient address"" on the return label.
