4793665,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I was skeptical with this show being any good............I now have my husband watching it as well as my sisters........i want to get the season and watch with out COMMERCIALS, that part sucks, COMMERCIALS, if it wasn't for the COMMERCIALS!!!! it would seem like a big HBO airing, it is awesome,and is pretty spooky, that creature in the basement is freaky as all get out!",1318377600,,372,4.7384615384615385
4793666,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Having only seen the first episode, it may be premature to review this show. That said, both my spouse and I love the show. While the basic plot is predictable and would seem done to death, (family moves for a fresh start and their new home is haunted), the show has so many parts that are unexpected and fresh. The cinematography is strong, as is the casting. One of the best things about the horrifying moments is that they are not explained adnauseum, as so many horror moments are these days. People who are not patient and need everything explained will likely not enjoy this. The lack of resolution is intentional and builds the viewers sense of discomfort and intrigue. Looking forward to more episodes!",1318377600,20,710,4.688
4793667,4,B005LAJ1PE,"America Horror Story does something amazing: it sets us up for - not just 90 minutes of thril, chills, and terror - but for hopefully what will be seasons worth of intrigue, the unexplainable, and the unfolding of a family of chaacters who bing their own dimension to the multi-faceted show. Good fun, lots to keep us guessing, womdering, and scared.",1318291200,3,350,4.754098360655738
4793668,1,B005LAJ1PE,"I wanted to check out this show because I typically enjoy most shows that air on FX Networks - Sons of Anarchy, The Shield, etc. I couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes before I turned it off. It was horrible. Maybe I'm just not as patient as most to wait for a show to develop or perhaps I don't have the intellectual capabilities to ""see between the lines"" but I don't want to have to think to hard when I watch TV. After all, isn't the whole point to forget your troubles and just zone out for a bit? I just didn't get this show, was it a horror or a comedy, or a mix of both? There's so much television to choose from these days...why waste your time with something like this? Unless you have unlimited time on your hands, I'd find something else to watch.",1318291200,8,769,4.167785234899329
4793669,4,B005LAJ1PE,"For weeks and weeks now I've seen those weird and downright creepy commercials advertising ""American Horror Story."" After about seeing the same commercial with the guy with the spandex suit thirty times, I finally decided just to see what the heck this show was about. It's a horror show. Well like a kintergardner would say- NO DOY! It's created by the guy that made ""Nip/Tuck"" and who CO-CREATED ""GLEE."" I just performed all caps rage for saying that because a lot of people have seemed to be turned off by that. I was too-kind of. Of course I knew it had nothing to do with a bunch of unsocial high-schoolers singing songs that made me want to pour acid down my throat, that being said, and finally just said ""What the heck? I'll just check it out."" OH-MY-GOD!! I was just shocked at how well done this was made. It's very insteresting and is very scary. It's absolutley nothing like ""Glee"" or ""Nip/Tuck."" My problem with this show is that if it has a second season- what would it be about? I've seen plenty of horror films and know that there isn't a true extending story. It's usually DEATH-DEATH-CREPPY STUFF-DEATH-KILL-CLIFFHANGER. Now I know horror films, usually slashers, have sequels. But they're usually about different people or the main characters have to go through the same crap from the first one ALL OVER AGAIN! I have high hopes for this show- but I just don't what they're going to do with it. I really enjoyed the pilot- and I'm looking forward to watching it again. Even if my horror film theory might have downgraded it for some- STILL WATCH THIS! It's weird, creepy, and feels like the television mini-series version of ""The Amityville Horror."" I highly recommend this show. Overall, I give it an 8/10.",1318032000,3,1726,4.680921052631579
4793670,1,B005LAJ1PE,"I thought the ad campaign with the various horror movie musical themes was irritating, I saw the Glee/Nip Tuck creators' names on it and lost even more interest. But something about that image of Connie Britton and the guy in the gimp suit on the ceiling unnerved me and drew my curiousity. I figured it couldn't hurt to try despite the terrible reviews. I had to try.

Take the title of this review as making a long story short. Don't.

This is a truly wretched show. Over the top, tone deaf crap. A pretty good definition of throw s*** at the wall and see what sticks. A bunch of admittedly unnerving imagery randomly thrown together and given a cliche plot, this show isn't worth your time.",1317859200,14,693,4.492063492063492

If you need to get seasick and feel sorry for a director who can't afford a tripod for most scenes, then this is the series for you.

Everytime, everyone went full LibTard, Total SJW nutjob, or Bi polar . I was hoping a supernatural monstrosity would come out of the woodwork and end the viewers stress. But, overall, a twisted horror flick. Sometimes not even the supernatural parts. Season 1 is not based on domestic tranquillity.. .",1507507200,,462,4.935897435897436

4794008,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Originally, I saw this on Netflix during high school, but I only watched the first episode; I enjoyed it, but there were some... heated moments that made me uncomfortable.

Now, several years later, got obsessed with the AHS franchise (the sexy scenes still creep me out), and had to get them on dvd ASAP!!!
This first installment of American Horror Story is absolutely remarkable! A Haunted house filled with a variety of ghosts, tensions in the family, and plenty of violence~!!

I also love how most the actors and actresses involved in Murder House and later seasons pop up again in a different role each time! This tv series is like a long, horror film... in television format!!",1493942400,2,683,4.779661016949152

4794098,1,B005LAJ1PE,My wife and I almost made it through the first episode but were bored by the plot(?) and other nonsense. You probably don't want to watch this with your children unless you want to risk explaining what a c***sucker is. I'm not a prude but I have standards and expectations when it comes to language and gore posing as substance.  No wonder Christians are concerned.

4794140,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I am a fan of haunted house movies. I watched the show when it first aired on FX and I absolutely loved it. I love the circular storytelling theme they use in order to slowly reveal the history of the house week after week! It kinda reminds me of lost, we find something new each week about the house or the ghosts that haunt it!

The show is about the Harmon family who move from Boston to Los Angels. The house is beautiful, I want to live there! The soundtrack is amazing; The Violet and Tate story-line is by far the best in the show! plus there's plenty of violence and nudity; Dylan McDermott walks around naked most of the time showing plenty of skin! (sorry no full frontal, but plenty of butt shots!)

There are some graphic depictions of rape, violence, and murder. witch may be triggers for some people. But if your willing to overlook that it's a great story! And be sure to check out Coven, Freakshow, and Hotel!",1487894400,,925,4.372093023255814
4794141,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Agree or disagree, my personal opinion is that this WAS the only AHS worth watching.  The others had so much potential with their settings and characters--and blew it.  This season was one that actually had me in withdrawal for next week's installment, and though it seemed convoluted, this season actually told a whole story with a beginning, middle and end.  The others were marketed as ""clues to the big finale, where all will be revealed""--yeah, not so much.  The final season was one of the worst.  I recommend this season as a great horror binge night selection, or as a look at something that really hadn't been done before.  It was brilliant.  Let's just pretend that there were no other seasons....",1487808000,4,707,4.793388429752066

4794841,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I watched all the other seasons of AHS but had no interest in Season One. Finally one weekend I broke down and binge watched it. I have no idea why it took me so long, and in some ways it was my favorite season to date. The cast is amazing in every season, and they seem to only get better with each new role. Creative writing and inventive plot twists keep you glued to the screen. I could have done without the last episode. It seemed unnessisary and dragged on a bit, like they were just trying to fill time. I felt similarly to the final episode in Season Six (Roanoke), but regardless, doesn't detract from the five star rating.",1485129600,,633,4.283333333333333
4794842,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Quite gory and bloody, but well-done and well-acted.  It gets you hooked to keep watching and find out the source of all of the craziness.",1484870400,,138,4.52

4795007,1,B005LAJ1PE,I discovered why I missed this when it was first on.  The whole story could have been told in 4 or 5 episodes instead of 10.  I will keep an open mind and continue on to season 2.  As far as season 1 is concerned....UGH.,1484697600,,220,3.8444444444444446

4795010,4,B005LAJ1PE,You have to be mentally prepared to watch this show's first season THE MURDER HOUSE.  I have to admit it was good but I also had a few nightmares....it's gruesome yet you can't look away.  The actors remain in season 2 which is titled ASYLUM...which again is just as gruesome.,1484697600,,276,4.5

4795183,1,B005LAJ1PE,"It's scary enough and seems a quality production, but I couldn't make it past the 2nd episode.  Just too icky, not my speed of horror.  I liked The Conjuring, and by comparison this is just too much in-your-face creepiness.  If you have trouble getting bad images out of your mind, you'll need lots of brain bleach after watching this.",1484438400,,335,4.6440677966101696

4796371,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I did not start watching the show until Season 4 aired, ""American Horror Story: Freak Show"" and have been a fan ever since.
So naturally I had to watch the other seasons and began with binging S1 ""American Horror Story: Murder House"" (this product).
While S1 was milder than the other seasons I felt it was important for me as a fan to see the every season and MH is certainly a great way to start the franchise...especially since there are people, pieces and things that connect one season to another...in sort of a bizarre anthology.

Hard of me to compare it to other works in the genre simply because Horror has never been a preference in my entertainment choices and even now it is the only Horror show that I watch. So if you are an occasional or reluctant Horror fan this would make a good series for you to get in to.",1481846400,,825,4.357142857142857

4800175,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Amazingly well written & acted.  This could be SO hockey, but--somehow--the writers have made it work.  It is fun discovering the secret behind each character.

As it was, I found myself staying up until 2:00 in the morning to watch the next show more than once.  Then I thought about it the next day.  The actors were excellent, the characters were complex.  This was far more than a haunted house story.  I especially enjoyed Fay Dunnaway in her role as the next door neighbor.  I highly recommend this series.",1476576000,,437,4.5256410256410255

4804779,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This is a quality tv show that is absolutely not for atheists. After one of them became unfortunate enough to insult the witch tradition over mere yt drama a long time ago, Hollywood has decided to make one of the best politically incorrect tv shows ever to go against the status guo. Welcome to American Horror Story, where old and decaying houses are turned into beautiful works of art as a result of a cooperation between director, producers and actors which has resulted in a successful revival of the Reconstruction of little known buildings similar in design to Classic Architecture. Each season takes place in such a little known house which helps boost tourism and which also presents us with a truly terrifying perspective of how much has changed over the course of the twentieth century when it comes to confront the difficulties of living in a house for families with a moderate to large income from the 1970s to the present day. The house in the story is occupied by a psychiatrist and his family who must confront their inner demons if they are going to successfully live in the house. Its up to the viewer to determine if they are imagining things or living a haunted nightmare, but American Horror Story has turned out to be one of my personal favorite TV shows and a show I highly recommend - for believers and skeptics of the supernatural alike. The more they increase the power of their fears the more grip they have over them - abandonment, social exclusion, etc. The less faith they have in their ability to use the house to realize their dreams. The scariest part of the show is that the previous residents were suffering from the exact same problem. Trying to find a way to keep the house alive, which is of course not very easy. Particularly not if you are a doctor. The storyline is convincing and well crafted and anybody who wants to reconstruct an old building should watch at least one episode of American Horror Story or some other tv material which can provide them with important restoration clues. But I am truly saddenned that we the people of Iceland have not been so active in the business of restoring old houses and I am still hopeful that eventually the producers will resort to doing a season that takes place in an Icelandic house. As a viewer I am truly thankful for the entertainment this show has brought me and I also consider this show an important gift for future generations of architects and horror fans who are architects - my excuses for a rather clumsy language here. The show has contrubited significantly to the evoulution of modernity and the necessary obsolesence of Brutalism although future shows may nonetheless take place in a few Brutalist buildings. For those who have not seen the show, welcome to the world of American Horror Story, your visitation has been expected with much enthusiasm. For we are masters of our fate, and must learn to love and respect the old as much as we have the new. Quality show, a major improvement in horror TV!",1469318400,,3002,4.666037735849057

While I do wish that there was an outer ""dust jacket"" for the set, it's not really a big deal that there's none. The plastic case for this set is standard, as are the disks. It's the show that does all the talking! Wonderfully dark and twisted, very sexual and dramatic, this one will leave you saying ""Oh, just one more episode. I can go to bed later."" This series is rated ""M for Mature"" for a reason; sexual scenes, adult language and themes are scattered often throughout.

It's a jumbled mess with interesting ideas which are ruined by poor pacing. It feels like it should have been 6 episodes, but was padded out with a whole lot of boring to make 12. I honestly never cared about ANY of the characters, and Jessica Lange's just annoyed me. The closest I came to caring was Taissa Farmiga as the daughter. Remember how cool The Twilight Zone was and then they made that awful movie in 80's? That's what this season felt like; a lot of really neat ideas which I really wanted to like, but didn't.

4807203,3,B005LAJ1PE,"AHS: Murder House felt almost good. Occasionally there were flashes of really good.

From the starting gun, there was just a whole mess of things happening. Each episode piled on more. The season is like a whole anthology of haunting stories spliced together.

Crazy things that happen in one episode are barely, if at all, acknowledged by characters. Even if the next episode is happening the same day as the last.

Ghostly visitations, murders, medical bomb shells, all pass with a shrug from the hapless haunted house owners. This is true of many haunted house stories. But it is so drastic here, you can't tell if it's a plot hook, incompetence, or metafictional humor. I sincerely thought the show was going to steal a page (the last one) from the Clive Barker story The Yattering and Jack.

Nope. Turns out they are just that oblivious.

However, many of the characters are exceptionally interesting. The ghosts are nicely portrayed as personified obsession, greed and hate, while still making them deep enough to be compelling. The acting is top notch throughout, even when their lines are ridiculous.

Scary is subjective, but I think this season is a little light on fear. Some good jump scares, a few unsettling gore and sadism scenes, very little creeping dread.

If you like to see sexy people do sexy things, this show (sporadically, of course) will indulge you. Those who prefer men will get more actual skin, but the show brings a lot of great actors to essentially be ""hot chick of the week"".

Good horror shows with this kind of money and production value behind them are few. If you are out of shows, you could do worse (or better).",1461715200,,1650,4.764912280701754

I feel the writers are trying to overcompensate for what is regrettably, to me, a lack of skill. Some of the story line makes no sense whatsoever, one minute a character is dead, the next minute --surprise! She is alive again! This to me lacks credibility and ultimately, I resent being manipulated in this fashion. The story line is at times non-sensical. It appears that the writers are attempting to overcompensate for just plain lack of skill. With all the talented people coming to LA why, oh, why does mediocrity and lack of imagination always seem to get foisted upon the hapless public? Anything vaguely socially redeeming? Nope.

4809520,5,B005LAJ1PE,I still think that the first season of American Horror Story was the best they've had.  The plot line was fun and the characters were all well-developed.  I liked that this season was less about the shock and awe of really gritty horror and more about telling a great creepy story.,1454112000,,281,4.490196078431373
4809521,5,B005LAJ1PE,"AHS is an interesting show in that every season features a different set of characters and a different plot line. This season is more classically a horror story than the other genres. Without giving away too much, this season revolves around a family that's going through relationship difficulties moving in to a new house. The house, as one would expect, is full of dark secrets. The plot is interesting and the characters are well developed. There are plenty of spooks for those who are looking for horror. Thye episode ""Home Invasion"" still bothers me every single time I watch it. There is also a great story line and you'll leave scared and thinking about life, relationships, and the nature of good/evil.

On a side note, AHS does not need to be watched in any order (you can watch season 3 and then 1 and it wouldn't make a huge difference). You'll still enjoy each season and won't be lost because the plots are (mostly) independent. However, some seasons contain some connections and ""easter eggs"" that you might miss if you haven't seen prior seasons. Season 5 (Hotel), without going into any detail, contains elements of this season. If you watch this one first, you'll get a better experience from Hotel. Still feel free to watch them in any order, but you may miss some elements from a couple episodes if you watch this season after season 5.",1454025600,2,1355,4.717299578059071

4810501,1,B005LAJ1PE,"Why so many positive glowing reviews? Because we have a serious problem with the dumbing down of Americans. Simpletons who have no care for quality and creative television. But rather focus and marvel at morbidity, homosexuality and perversion. There really is no explanation to the positive reviews other than today's people brainwashed into believing Jessica Lange is strictly the reason for this show have greatness. Worshiping at the shrine of an actress instead of quality writing, quick thinking directors, multidimensional actors. People believing the darkness of murder, seduction, sex, dismemberment, rape are something to be marveled at with new found amazement. In fact, the writers and director created a pile of excrement which should have been scrapped. I wish I had chromosomal damage. In that case, I would be jumping up and down at the stupidity of the plot and the infinite time it took to explain one thing. Even then, suspend your belief system with hallucinogens if you are to make it through this disaster.

4810902,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I've watched this many, many times. It is by far the least creepy compared to the others, especially the following season.  I never thought I would follow anything creepy. The thing that has me watching it every year is, in part, it's simplicity as good and evil are examined along with interesting family and community dynamics. There were funny parts, sweet parts, teary parts alongside anger, madness and unimaginable cruelty. Courage, love and happiness were not lost to revenge and way too much death. It explored so many ideas about what a spirit (ghost?) and it's continuation (or not) on some plane of being. It wasn't religious, yet all ideas were quietly  expressed. I  averted my eyes instinctively and knowingly  with the help of a building tension in the script, filming and soundtrack. (Thank you for that!) I skipped through the Piggy, Piggy episode to avoid the results of that tale and avoided looking at dead bodies.  Overall I found myself having such empathy and compassion for characters that had no ability to feel emotion themselves (but are great mimics)...just like real life. The finale of this first season was very satisfying while still provoking thought. I'm trying really hard not to think about how all the seasons might relate to each other and through who!",1448841600,2,1290,4.953703703703703

And always keeps you guessing :-) an amazing cast , when everybody from the impeccable Jessica Lange, Dylan McDermott , Connie Britton, Zachary Quinto and Evan peters. The first season is much different than any of the following four, this one stays mainly in the same location, inside the porterhouse or next door and Jessica Lange a.k.a. Constance home with her daughter with down syndrome. You seem to have their dark secrets and a daughter that always seems to harass the newcomers telling them that they're gonna die in that house which is starting to freak out the new family.

The seasons I have watched have some humor sprinkled through out each episode,  Season one does not which makes it a little overwhelming with constant darkness.  It is not the kind of show you can follow if you miss an episode.

4811686,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I like it!  The blood and gore is a little stylized and short-lived so it doesn't gross you out, and the acting is very good with people who have proven their skills in other shows as well as films: Jessica Lange (terrific!), Dylan McDermott, Connie Britton, Kate Mara.  The plots intertwine and sometimes are all over the map, which can be confusing.  It has some eye-candy, some sexual moderate content, and few laughs, as well. Overall, it captures my attention and is a pretty good show.",1447718400,,491,4.686046511627907

4811731,3,B005LAJ1PE,"Really strange and nonsensical stories but I just have to keep watching to see what silly thing they'll come up with next.
It seems like the writers made a list of all the things that this generation would find...triggering, I guess; stuff that nobody wants to write stories about like school shooters, wrist cutters, discrimination against gays and different ethnicities. And then some ""strong female character"" or other underdog will come and save the day, as if to make up for all the triggers they flipped on the sensitive viewers; the same people will find that sort of stuff satisfying.
 It just seems a bit try-hard.

I watched season 1 in pitch darkness any night I couldn't sleep and it was a little bit scary I guess.",1447718400,3,727,4.716535433070866

Even when the ""stock"" family moved into the ""stock"" ""murder house"", I reminded myself of all the positive reviews the series got.  The first three episodes had some really creepy moments and kept the sinister vibe going.  The intrusive neighbor lady and her even more intrusive daughter kept me on edge, waiting for their next unexpected zig or zag.  The difference in how the housekeeper was literally perceived by the the wife and the husband was also a great addition to the creep factor.  The dead people were well acted, but by the Halloween episode, the sheer number of ghosts/dead people in and around the house, overwhelmed the well-worn plot.

Partially filmed at beautiful 'real' Hollywood mansion, (look up filming locations. & name of estate) Check out the old push button light switches. Season One great.

4812753,5,B005LAJ1PE,"but WOW! It's easy these days to get disappointed quickly with the multiple varieties of shows being thrown at you from all angles. My wife and I started watching this from day one. I remember looking at her and saying ""where did this come from?"" This show has caught us off guard so many times. The writers are as sick as they are geniuses (and I mean that very respectfully). It's hard to keep my attention but this show always gives that ""no way that just happened feeling."" The entire cast is absolutely brilliant. Coven was a masterpiece all in itself and Angela Bassett as Marie Laveau was the bulls-eye in the series. I've been to New Orleans several times and have also visited Marie's grave site. So this was the perfect back drop for a Coven of witches. And just when you thought it couldn't get any better they threw Stevie Nicks right into it. Man what a crazy ride this show has been. The ones giving this a poor review completely missed the ""Horror"" part of the title. Hey guys if you hate eggs don't order an omelette.",1446508800,,1033,4.442105263157894

Ben, Vivien, and their teenage daughter Violet move to LA for a fresh start.  The family was derailed after the loss of their unborn baby, and I guess moving across country into a creepy old house always fixes everything, right?  I mean, it did for those people who moved to Amityville!  Things get freaky pretty quickly after move in day.  Their neighbor Constance (brilliantly bizarre performance by Jessica Lange) and her adult child keep popping over and you know right away that something ""ain't right"" about them.  The house is a major character in this story, and it's former occupants just can't seem to stay away.  The ghosts that are stuck in the house are like malevolent mosquitoes - annoying and blood thirsty.  Episode 12 of Season I was disappointing because it's nothing but a lo-o-ong resolution, because the climax of the series is in episode 11.

4813281,3,B005LAJ1PE,"Meh. 2.5 stars. It has a fine cast and a fine look, but it also has a couple of big flaws. For one, it's much more about pushing the tv envelope on gore, twisted sex and general grossness than on actually being scary. It is almost never scary, but since it's tv it can never push the envelope anywhere near the way movies can, so a lot of it falls kind of flat. For another, the writers got so busy whipping up subplots that they abandon logic, so that you're constantly saying, ""Hey wait a minute. Why doesn't she...? Why is he...?"" I know that people in horror stories are supposed to act like dopes, but this carries that tradition way too far. Also, too many of the subplots are just perverse, tv-edgy takes on age-old soap opera ideas. On the up side, Jessica Lange is hilarious as the evil next door neighbor.",1446076800,2,815,4.333333333333333

Well . . . I finally got over it. The show is honesty ""creepy"" without being totally gruesome After five+ seasons of the Walking Dead, I would say this show has little gore. It's truly clever, It's back to horror basics: eerie, disturbing, weird, and fun. A perfect way to usher in Halloween.",1446076800,,461,4.775

4813856,3,B005LAJ1PE,"The show is more disturbing than scary, but it does have a few images that will stick in your head.  There is not much build up for some of the ""scares,"" and each episode is a hodgepodge of various scenes, some of which just end randomly without really adding to the story (i.e., more for shock factor).

4813947,1,B005LAJ1PE,"Really I tried several episodes because sometimes it takes a bit to get into the plot/vein of the story but the more I watched the more annoying it became, if you like cheap thrills and lots of queer, kinky stuff, bloody gore, then you may like it, but it is too venial and base, too irrational, you never know who is a ghost and who is real, it gives ghosts (dead people) an extremely physical ability to kill as if they had a body, (impossible) and it raises many lines between moral and immoral characters, there is no right and wrong, everyone gets ""the raw deal"" no one ever wins, very depressing and disappointing.",1445472000,4,620,4.447368421052632

4814202,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I'm behind the times in watching American Horror Story. I was curious and gave it a try. This show has been on my thoughts since finishing season one it a few days ago. It was not what I expected. For someone seeking a horror fest, this season might not be satisfying (I haven't seen the subsequent seasons, so cannot compare scariness). I'm not much into horror; that is why it took me so long to watch this show. I do, however, enjoy haunted stories that focus on character and what makes or breaks them. There were scary element to American Horror Story, it is set in a haunted house, yet I found the show more sad (in a tragic way) than scary. American Horror Story, season 1, is set in an early Twentieth Century California small mansion. The house is inhabited by the spirits of those who came before. Most of those suffered heartrending fates. These heartbreaking stories haunt my thoughts as I consider the ""what ifs"" of these characters. I thoroughly enjoyed American Horror Story, season 1, for the stories told. The quality of the acting and overall writing made up for the few frayed storylines that were left dangling.",1444867200,,1131,4.6318407960199

4815101,3,B005LAJ1PE,"You wouldn't guess it from the promo shot and the creepy/disturbing visually sadistic intro song but AHS isn't really that scary at all when you get right down to it. It ends up being more drama than horror with a slightly more dumbed down plot than I would have liked. Not a bad show by any means. In fact the story is gripping and I was actually very much hooked for about 5 episodes but in the end I sat down to watch a scary horror show and this didn't end fitting the bill. Keep in mind, this is for season 1, I haven't seen any of the other series.",1443398400,2,554,4.045454545454546

There are some disturbing subjects covered and I almost stopped watching it because of them.  The plot keeps weaving along with redemption along the way for innocent lives taken which makes the evil smooth out a bit.  I can not stop watching.

I finally had a moment to watch and once I started it was impossible to stop. I am glad I was able to binge watch straight through. It would have been pure agony to wait between episodes. I'm starting season 2 now, it's equally riveting. Thank you, dear entertainment gods, for a fascinating  show and the technology to efficiently 'waste' time.",1440720000,,450,4.487804878048781

4815906,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I admit I worked my way backward on AHS, beginning with Season 4 and going in reverse to 3 and 2 and finally Season 1.  So, that probably influenced how I viewed Season 1, and at least subconsciously, comparing it to the other seasons.  And that's probably why Season 1 gets only 4 stars rather than 5; it's good, and I liked it, but the later Seasons are much better, especially Season 4.
Nonetheless, it is impossible to quibble with anything that contains a Jessica Lange performance like this; Frances Conroy is consistently amazing and Evan Peters is terrific throughout all 4 seasons playing a wide range of characters.  Zachary Quinto sets a nice stage for who he was to become in later seasons and Taissa Farmiga really grows on you as the episodes progress.
Again, it's not totally fair to compare this to later seasons but, the writing isn't as strong as it gets to be in later years, and the ending (no spoiler) was a confusing mishmash that didn't resolve things very satisfactorily.
Bottom line, I looked forward to each episode and I am ready for Season 5.",1440633600,,1070,4.621052631578947

So I received a prompt from Amazon that I wasn't utilizing my Prime and thought ""Well, I'm paying for it, I should check it out and see what I can use"".
 I came across the American Horror Story and decided to watch it.
This show is awesome!
The characters are believable.
The acting is great and Dylan Mcdermott has been a favorite of mine since his shoe The Practice.

In addition, Jessica Lange was simply terrific.  Hell, they were all great; the series was marvelously cast.  The writing was also top-notch, ferociously smart in the best sense, with the many story lines marvelously woven together across the entirety of the season.  What I found particularly striking was the highly conservative nature of the chief themes: the wages of infidelity, the need for personal accountability, and the existence of real evil beyond the reach of therapy or good intentions.  I stumbled upon this series without having heard anything about it (I live under a rock in popular culture terms) and could not have been more pleased with my entertainment experience.  I hope the people involved with it are as justifiably proud and pleased with their handiwork as they deserve to be.",1439078400,9,969,5.246753246753247

I began with Asylum, which was great, so I didn't expect that this debut season would live up to that, but it did. The goings-on in this show are just CRAZY and you watch it like a train wreck, mesmerized by all the chaos. The writers rarely tip their hand, so the twists are not telegraphed, though the clues are all there beforehand, so the audience has no reason to feel cheated.

Jessica Langes character is so mysterious, yet likeable, you cant wait til she appears onscreen again. The show is full of accomplished actors, young and old who all really sell this material. Its like a great combination of those 70s psychological thrillers like Burnt Offerings crossed with Desperate Housewives, yet too competent to qualify as a guilty pleasure.",1439078400,,908,4.82051282051282

4816359,2,B005LAJ1PE,"I started watching American Horror Story a while back because I heard it was a great series and could get it free with Amazon Prime. I'm almost through the first season and may or may not continue watching. I will say that the show's production and especially the characters are excellent-- they are extremely realistic and believable. However, there are a lot of parts that I've found too disturbing and morbid. Some I skipped through altogether because they are so disturbing or depressing. One of the main problems I've had with this show is that the plot is extremely confusing and I feel that the show focuses on too many different characters, many of which have complicated histories and complex problems. It sometimes jumps back and forth between the past and the present, but I can't figure out which characters are truly alive and which ones are dead even with the flashbacks. If I was to continue watching, I hope that more is revealed in later episodes so I can better follow the plot. You have to watch it to decide if it's for you.",1438819200,4,1044,4.648648648648648

4817113,1,B005LAJ1PE,"Predictable and boring. I've seen two seasons, and they do nothing but repeat the same themes - attempted suicide, murder, and glorified rape. Seriously! The consensual stuff is faded out. The rape is front and center. If I don't see another naked ass it'll be too soon.

The only actual horror in this show besides the blood, is apparently all the overused themes. Ghosts, murder, suicide, insane teenagers... every awful stereotype that exists... and the story made absolutely no sense! Nothing followed in any real logical order.

This could have been GREAT. This could have been REAL horror. Instead, it's just gratuitous sexual violence, and a s***ty story with poor execution. The only redeeming qualities it has are the actors. But not even talent can fix what a sack of crap this show is. I wanted to like it. There were even a couple characters I liked. Sad.

It's obvious the writers were going for something, but it wasn't horror, and ended up a confusing mess. I like horror to make me think, and at the very least SOMETHING should stick with me. Repeated rapes shouldn't be one of those things. The one writer from Nip-Tuck is as obsessed with his Oedipus complex as ever.

Just avoid this show and go find a far better one.",1434931200,11,1237,4.712962962962963

4817602,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Dark, deranged, twisted and sick and I loved every freaking moment of it. These people are the strangest on earth they do things to each other you would never believe. It begins with an attractive couple a psychiatrist his wife and teenage daughter moving into a beautiful old house with a dark history. Their first day there they meet their next door neighbor played byJessica Lange who comes looking for her autistic daughter who has a creepy uncanny knack for getting into the house

After settling in slowly bizzar things begin to happen and as the story goes on the history of the houses previous owners through the years is discovered shocking things a murder among other things. The first owner was a doctor who built the house for his wife and the path he chose to follow is indeed horrific and beyond imagining ,

The new owners are trying to start over after the loss of their unborn child, he has a strange assortment of psychiatric patients one is a charming kind hearted teenage boy with a creepy connection to the old house. Later on the wife finds out she is pregnant and the couple is ecstatic about it and happily start preparing for the new arrival

As hidden secrets are brought to light the young doctors dark secret comes out. Then there is a guy dressed in one of those black rubber S&M outfits with a ski mask like hood on it sneaking around their home scaring others and later on does that lead to a mind blowing surprise. Jessica Lange's character also has a connection to house and was involved in something tragic that took place in the past. I don't want to give anything away and spoil it for others but this is an amazing series, I thought after season 1 this could not possibly get any scarier but season 2 and 3 are proved me wrong and even darker than season 1. Season 4 is really creepy I rented episode 1 of it and it is really good, American Horror story just keeps getting better and better. Angela Bassett fans will be glad to know she stars in Seasons 3 and 4 as Marie Levaue the famous voodoo queen",1431820800,3,2038,4.44385026737968

Haunted House, Asylum, Witches, and Clowns and Freakshows.  Really Excited to see what Creep Factor they use for ""Hotel"".  Do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this Amazing Show cause once you get going its hard to stop.  Take my word for it.",1431043200,,594,4.25

4817878,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This is an absolutely amazing season of AHS.  I think ""horror"" is the appropriate term: the show chooses ""disturbing"" narratives from each decade all living within one household.  It is  a little scary, but mostly depressing, disturbing, unsettling (in my opinion, going back to the basics of horror, not just the films of today that just get a rise of fear out of people).  Evan Peters is the star to watch, although everyone (especially Frances Conroy) provide great performances.  My only complaint is that the ending ""jumps the shark"" (which perhaps is also meant to be unsettling), but since this is only a small part of the show, it can be forgiven.",1430352000,,655,4.8125

Afterall, a show with Jessica Lange and Frances Conroy had to be worth an hour of my time. Wow, AHS hit all the right marks. A brilliant cast, with smart, sharp (sometimes campy) writing. The production design and directing incorporates classic mise en sc&egrave;ne, that allows the ""murder house"" to remain the lead character. As a native Angelino, I love the way the rich, dark history of LA has been incorporated into the story. While the season as a whole is quite a thrill tide; there are a couple of episodes that are contrived, yet the main story is just too compelling to give up on. Yep, I'm hooked a and about to start season 2.",1427760000,,765,4.394366197183099

4819429,2,B005LAJ1PE,"If you liked Stephen King's books and movies from the '70s and '80s-- or if you're entirely unfamiliar with them-- the first season of 'American Horror Story' might be right up your alley: baroque haunted-house melodrama with lots of gore and sexual depravity, insipid chatter, ghosts, flashbacks, teen angst and, most of all, adults making incredibly poor parenting/relationship/life choices.  But for those of us who were inundated by this kind of pulp growing up, enough was (and remains) enough.  There isn't a character, plot twist, or ghoulish backstory here that hasn't been done dozens of times before, and the scripts are almost oppressively overwritten (yes, even the licentious see dead people-- we get it).  The only thing 'new' that AHS brings to the party is a spring-fresh layer of vulgarity that seems to be the raison d'etre for nearly every 'MA'-rated show cranked out in the past ten years (note to perpetually pubescent TV producers: just because you can doesn't mean you should).  All that subjective criticism aside, as a fan of the horror genre, my biggest problem with the series (so far, at least) is its anemic scare value: television is a visual medium, after all, so why not take advantage of it?  Creep us out instead of boring us to bloody tears with endless streams of soap-opera-quality dialogue; paint gruesome pictures instead of drawing busy diagrams; get our nightmare-conjuring imaginations stirring instead of incessantly telegraphing how clever and creative your scenarists are.  Still, being a glutton for punishment, I plan to try season two.  This one pulls only about 2 stars, mainly for the gallant efforts of the cast.",1425859200,3,1663,5.114391143911439

There is so many shows being produced now, and with Prime I try many, so ANY one of them that keeps me captivated will get three or four stars. This one gets four, and after experiencing Breaking Bad during it's run, I can't imagine ever giving any TV show five stars. BB is the holy grail of what I want from a show and all are measured from there down. American Horror Season 1 kept me in my seat, but the moments of my mind being blown out of my skull were few and far between. But then there is Jessica Lange. What a 10 star treasure.

If you think this show has real potential after watching season one, I would highly recommend you give season's 2 and 3 a chance?  The rest of the cast is outstanding, but Jessica Lange is simply delicious in those 2 seasons ... as good as it gets, if dark entertainment is your thing.",1424476800,,642,4.145161290322581
4819976,4,B005LAJ1PE,This is where this innovative series began. Everything seems to start with a haunted house but with this house the dead are able to mingle with the living. The cast is exceptional with Dylan McDermott as the lead protagonist and Connie Brittain as his wife. Their daughter is a cutter who winds up with the proverbial boy next door.  Only this boy is dead!  Zachary Quinto makes his entrance midway through the series as a former owner. All in all this is an exceptional series that will have you wanting for more and Ryan Murphy delivers.,1424476800,,539,4.604166666666667

4820355,4,B005LAJ1PE,"The first season of AHS that I had a chance to watch was actually Freak Show, which was season four. I liked it so much that I decided to go back to previous seasons and check them out as well. So, this season (season 1) was the second season that I had watched of the show, if that makes sense. I write my review from the perspective that I finished season 4, then finished season 1. As promised, no spoilers.

Some have said that Murder House was ""scarier"" than Freak Show; however, I think that the actual scariness is just different. Freak Show had its share of dark moments, as does Murder House. For a first season of a show, Murder House did a fine job casting the roles and allowing the scenes to play out in the way that they did. I will say that some parts were a little bit predictable, but then again, I watched another season before this and got a sense of the timing and nature of how things would progress. However, since Freak Show was the first season that I had watched, it was unpredictable for me, yet others who watched previous seasons felt that Freak Show was very predictable for them. I still enjoyed seeing how things would play out, and there were still things that happened that kept me on my toes.

When the promos for Murder House played out, I remember one of them mentioning that AHS would have an influence on the horror genre and give it another dimension. I definitely agree with that because it demonstrated that: 1) horror shows do not have to necessarily star little-known/B-list actors- they can feature good, believable stars; 2) AHS goes into great detail about personal stories of characters, thus providing the ""character you love"" or ""character you love to hate"" feelings; 3) the envelope for what can be shown on ""regular"" TV can be pushed, and the viewers still keep coming. I could go on and on, but I would like to make the point that this show has pushed to be the best that it can give to viewers.

I recommend this for anybody who is looking for a new, interesting show to watch. Take a look at the content list before watching, especially if there are some things that you may find offensive or disturbing. This show is definitely scary/freaky too- I know somebody who loves horror and watched this, but as the show progressed, she had to stop watching because it was getting too disturbing for her to watch. I cannot make the decision as to whether you decide to watch the show, but if you are unsure, my best advice would be to read a little about the synopsis, take a look at non-spoiler reviews, and read into the show warnings. However, I would not recommend stopping mid-way through the season because it only gets better!

Another thing to keep in mind is that the first season is like a mini-series because it is only 12 episodes that are about 45 minutes each, making it somewhere around 9 hours (if I did the math right :) ). With any of the AHS seasons, it is not like you are making a commitment to a show that you are 6 seasons behind on and have to play catch-up with. It moves very quickly, so you do not have the boredom of a first season of getting to know characters, like other TV shows out there. Give it a try!",1424131200,,3183,4.389830508474576

4820526,3,B005LAJ1PE,"Just occasionally a studio executive will take a brave decision and risk making something extraordinary and, in the process, create an instant cult classic - think Firefly (interestingly also produced by Tim Minear) or Fringe. American Horror Story, however, falls quite a long way short of the mark. It is weird, quirky and genuinely scary in places but the spooky atmosphere is not maintained consistently; a lot of the time it feels more like American Family Soap. The mainstay of the show is the old ""who's dead and who isn't"" plot device which, in a house crowded with fully corporeal ghosts isn't as simple as you might think. Unfortunately, not being great aficionados of cult horror movies, a lot of the apparently clever reverential hat-tipping to famous scenes was completely wasted on us so maybe that is a dimension that may have added some much needed depth to the series. Mind you, if they are as subtle (not!) as the Kill Bill and Psycho pastiches then they're just as likely to interrupt the narrative flow.

With little time devoted to character development the cast are stuck playing simple, monolithic stock roles and this, combined with the uneven pace and atmosphere makes for a very shallow, superficial and almost corny feel to the whole show. The above notwithstanding, there are some good performances; Jessica Lange is a splendid faded southern belle and Zachary Quinto camps it up for all he's worth. A bit of mythology developed towards the end of the series but, on the whole, each episode is just an inconsequential and improbable series of events which fail to both further the almost non-existent plot or to engage the viewer. For us it certainly did not fall into the ""I don't care how late it is, let's just watch another episode"" category which defines the best series'; it was just something to watch as it was too early to go to bed & read.

As is evident, we were rather disappointed; we expected more given the 73% five star rating. Perhaps we were expecting too much or, more likely, we weren't the intended audience. It was OK'ish but definitely nothing for us to rave about.",1421452800,,2116,4.794520547945205

4820587,3,B005LAJ1PE,"*This is a review, so spoilers will be in it although I try not to give away huge plot points*

Scary, yes. Although I tend to avoid horror because I get easily jumped by them and they just aren't my cup of tea. But all my friends raved about it and it was free on prime so I thought, ""why not?"". Pilot drew me in and I needed to see what happened, the twists and turns of the plot as more secrets were revealed and stories changed as the truth came out, and the fact that Violet related to me all made me finish the season. Of course, it also seemed to be trying to tell too many stories at once and honestly if that many people die in the house in the year or so most of this season takes place in, I don't understand why the police weren't more curious about it.

I didn't quite like how some of the characters seemed to get better and then were evil again, only to be good and then revert back. I don't know if it was them lying or poor writing or some weird ghostly hormones, but it was a turn off. I am glad that the 'weird' and disfigured characters were mostly good though, all the other works (fiction or 'nonfiction') with people that don't look normal are usually the evil characters, so having Beau be a gentle spirit was refreshing, although I could be wrong because he was barely in it.

I think of the pasta arm from the show when thinking of this season, which was a weird kitchen tool they mentioned way too often for it's seemingly irrelevant status. You throw pasta at the wall to see what sticks, and I feel like that's what this season was, a whole mess of stories thrown in episodes to see what stuck with audiences. Personally, I don't think someone had to die as often as they did, we get it that it's called the murder house, but come on. Every other scene it felt like someone died or was being chased by someone trying to kill them.

*End of spoilers, final review TL;DR version*
I'm torn between giving it a 3 or a 4, it seems to fit in the middle, because it was a great show that kept me hooked, but it also felt like too much was told. A few less side stories and more detail on the present would have made the season better. I know each season is a different location and it has been confirmed they are connected, so maybe season 2 will get better.

Watch if you want to be spooked, love ghosts, like twisty stories, love blood and gore, or are a fan of 1920's homes built by surgeons to the stars.

4820991,2,B005LAJ1PE,"I watched about two and a half episodes.  The story looked very promising, but practically every character in this show is either creepy or deeply troubled with no other personality traits.  After two and a half episodes, the one-dimensionality of the characters grew too irritating to tolerate.  This show desperately needs a little comic relief, or a protagonist, a character or two with some life, or some sort of redeeming value.  After a while the story, however interesting, can't be intriguing enough to overcome the complete lack of any characters who are anything but dreary and disappointing.",1420329600,,602,5.175257731958763

Not scary. And there were so many holes in the plot because they had several beginning at the same time making it confusing to follow even when I watched each episode after the other. A lot of episodes would end and leave me thinking ""what actually happen in that episode?"" Because I feel like nothing happen and it was all filler. Episodes 10-12 were probably the best.

If you are shy or squeamish about viewing violence & sexual topics incorporated in a TV show, then this is not for you. If your under about age 17 or 18, this is not for you.
Anybody remember the show ""Nip Tuck"" ? Remember how the show was break through for its up front sexual topics, a show of a butt cheek or breast here or there, a crazy unsuspecting act of violence now and then. Take all that and triple it, Although the show is not based on sexual content, there are minor spouts of it peppered through the series. AHS for the most part is not predictable but you must not mind the sex and violence. Each season is a completely different story using the same actors playing different characters.",1419897600,,807,4.281045751633987

4822117,4,B005LAJ1PE,"This is one of wildest shows I've ever seen. It is not for the frail or weak of stomach.. BUT, once you start, it is almost a compulsion to continue watching. I started watching season 4 & was impressed with the lineup of actors... what a group. The writing is excellent, intense & hits the nerve endings that we all try to hide but are part of the human condition. Be honest... So, if you like a minor chord, the dark side or are just twisted, then this is something you want to watch (PS: I'm a little of each). Cheers. JJ",1418688000,,524,4.147058823529412

4822189,4,B005LAJ1PE,"A caveat....as much of a wild ride of a horror romp as this is, it was virtually unwatchable on Amazon Prime due to constant pauses for re-buffering.  Yes, indeed, there is a great deal of gore and mayhem to be had here, but any and all climatic build-ups get diffused when about every eight to ten minutes you get hung up on a re-buffering break.  This was worse in some episodes than others, but pervasive throughout the season's offerings, despite all of our efforts.............. and comments to Amazon Prime Video.

We didn't watch this series when it first aired on television, nor did we bother with season two.... that is until we watched season three as it came out on TV.  Quite frankly, it was the Stevie Nicks connection in that season that drew us in.  Once we were hooked, and discovered that the series followed a core group of actors in various, completely unrelated plots each season, we were in for the  count!  I guess we had been living under a rock.

This is finely crafted and beautifully shot.......and the troupe of actors are wonderful!  We were late to the AHS party, and we have had difficulties in playing along (thanks crappy re-booting issues), but we do recommend this, belated as we are!

Five stars for the series.......one star deducted due to Amazon's issues.",1418515200,,1294,4.711111111111111

4822703,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Started watching this knowing zero about it except is was an epic ghost drama. Watched 7 episodes in a row last night. WOW this show is good. At first I really didn't know why I thought it was good because it takes 2-3 episodes to get into full swing and there is no going back from there. I have never said WTF so many times in a single series every. Half the time you know it will all make sense in the end but really are just caught up in all the craziness. Other times i was brought to tears by some of the sad scenes and they are VERY sad. The acting for ALL charters In this series are mind blowing I really was impressed. I Love Jessica and of course she steals every single scene she is in then she tears it to shreds. I remember her in Hush and just had to see what she was up to these days. My god that woman is good lol. But the acting from everyone in this series is way above average I really wasn't expecting acting this good. I was totally invested in everyone. I loved the daughter she was incredible.

This show is full of very VERY dark, sad subjects and is not for everyone. There are some violent scenes and sexual content. Its nothing over the top by any means, I have seen much worse but for anyone who is sensitive to subjects involving children and babies might want to ask someone before they watch it. Some parts would be deeply disturbing and upsetting to some. I didn't find this show scary but in saying that I have not finished it yet. I have 5 more episodes to go so I might just get my *ss handed to me yet lol. I really have no idea what I am about to watch.

So far I am extremely impressed and will probably watch the remaining 5 or so episodes tonight. God knows what will happen, which is one of the things I really love about this. Everything seems to be so random sometimes and then it slowly starts to make sense. You really don't know what the hell is going on or what will happen next but are still fixed to the screen. its very clever how everything is woven together. The start might seem a bit slow but everything starts to build up some flesh and take shape. Before you know it you are in awe of what is happening and how everyone is interacting.

I didn't think it was scary but  must admit one or two scenes had me watching it through my hands and that is very rare for me. you really don't know what you will see next. Brilliant.",1417564800,,2378,4.10752688172043

However, watching this first season again on Amazon I found myself surprised by how much I enjoyed American Horror Story (season one). Once you get past a few initial dislikes the story itself becomes quite interesting. The characters that were disliked become intriguing and some new characters, very sinister but appealing, also show up. As a watcher comes to the end many things fall into place and the finale, although mournful, is not disappointing.",1417219200,,612,4.783018867924528

4822943,1,B005LAJ1PE,"I know a girl at work who says she likes horror. I'm contemplating giving this season 1 set to her because it is something I will never watch again. But then I worry that the girl might actually like this garbage and then I'd be feeling like I have less in common with her. And then too I might be encouraging the girl to embrace such garbage. . My point here is that American Horror, Season One is dreadful and shameless. The show tries to capitalize on human depravity and the darkness of our human nature. For example, homosexuality is exploited by the two gay ghosts in the show. Adultery is exploited in the lead male character. He is an adulterer. The show exploits S & M in the rubber suit, and the rubberman ghost. The show uses rape in it's exploitation of the baseness of human nature. The show is simply raunchy with all constant sexual situations. The main male character, when we are not seeing him naked from the back is always without his shirt. We see two different male asses in this season, so I guess the girls and gay men are kept titillated. But mostly I thought the characters must all be retarded because they can't seem to realize that they are surrounded by ghosts. At the age of 51 I have seen my fair share of horror, sci-fi, drama, comedy, you name the genre and I have viewed it but this show is simply SHOCK VALUE, DEPRAVITY and SEX. I actually fell asleep at least a half a dozen times watching this so called ""Horror"". First, American Horror Season one DEPRESSED ME because is it so DEPRAVED. My mind wanted to tune it out. And Second, IT IS BORING, PREDICTABLE and STUPID. The writers simply recycle horror from other movies and tv shows and throw anything and everything they can think in to attract a viewer. The new born child that lived is the spawn of a human and a ghost----- ew it's Rosemary's Baby. And we have a psychopath ghost who shot up kids in his high school, who killed the two gay men, and many other people. We have the unfaithful husband. We have the EXTREMELY CRAZY MANIACAL NEIGHBOR LADY who thinks she is some DEBUTANTE. We have a doctor/scientist who is trying to create some sort of a Frankenstein monster in the basement. Or think of the ""It's Alive"" movies, and you have the superfreak creature baby. Then the writers throw in the killers who are trying to emulate Charles Manson. There is the scene where the mother is eating brains, but she doesn't know it is brain matter. The tv show exploits the birth defect of down syndrome when it uses an actual down syndrome actor in the tv show. There is the character who has the head of his penis bitten off. There is the scene where the gay man comes on to the lead male of the show by asking to give him oral sex. This show is just plain GUTTER GARBAGE and it is AWFUL. I was NEVER entertained and each episode seemed to be SO LONG and so I fell asleep a lot.

A show like American Horror reminds me why I first started to attend a Christian church. And while I haven't been a church goer in over 20 years, the depraved human behavior on display in this show is all the reason I tried to be a better man. One can only wonder how this affects people who have to struggle from day to day in wondering what is right and what is wrong. People who emulate anything from the television show are going to contribute to the human and moral decay of our society and the macrocosm of societies around the world. And this show is a big hit too, or it is to my knowledge. I never knew anything about this show until I bought it at Walmart. I like horror and I was hoping for some entertainment. And I also recently watched a movie called ""Found"". It is just as bad as this show and this sort of ""entertainment"" is only going to lead to violence and depravity as people act out when they get angry or upset. It's pretty obvious that people act out the violence that they see in out entertainment culture. So, the next time you hear about a school shooting, or someone who kills their family, or rape and mindless murder, just refer back to American Horror and other similar forms of media. It is as simple as GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT. Put something unhealthy into your mind and it will come out in time. Put something HEALTHY into your mind and you will act out in a more HEALTHY form of behavior.

You don't have to be a mental patient to be affected by such depravity. A human being is constantly making choices and it's just as easy to start making bad and unhealthy choices. So, I hope responsible parents are not letting their children watch this sort of garbage. If you think Christianity is GARBAGE I can only wonder what people might think of the depravity that is American Horror Season one.",1416873600,4,4693,4.3561643835616435

4823381,5,B005LAJ1PE,"A family member suggested that I would like the series. Since I had already seen (and been unimpressed by) a few minutes of the show, I was hesitant to watch. But when I started from the beginning, I found the show creative, multilayered, and entirely successful. This is the first time in a very long time that I have seen so much invested in elevating the quality of story. Joss Whedon utilizes this level of excellence in storytelling. I am glad to see it again.

This series is unique in that, as other reviewers have mentioned, every season tells a self-contained--and thoroughly entertaining--story.

The acting is credible, nuanced and powerful. It is easy to see that quite a bit of thought went into the creation of the characters, some of whom are deeply terrible individuals (but fascinating nonetheless). I was also pleased to note that both the settings and soundtrack add to the general atmosphere of wrongness, displacement and unease.

Surprises abound. Pay attention to every creepy minute.",1415923200,,1007,4.982142857142857

Having said that, going back and watching the first season still gives me chills and reminds me over and over why I love this show. It's not just that it scares me, it's the way it scares me. Without gore and stupid over the top violence, the acting, writing, and directing are all in perfect harmony to scare the living crap out of me all while keepin you so enthralled with the characters and their individual stories, as well as when all their stories come together.

4823419,3,B005LAJ1PE,"This series is too graphic with the blood and guts.  The story line about a haunted house is not far from the truth.  I believe that spirits can be trapped in this dimension and can't leave because they are confused and lost.  I do understand the film makers efforts to create a series that will freak every one out with all the blood, guts and sexuality...but they leave nothing to the imagination.  The
acting is great, Jessica Lange works her role to a tea.  All the other actors are really good too.  Unlike many other series I watch, if I like them I can't stop watching.  With this series, I can only take small doses at a time. It's rather to negative for my tastes. Not one of my favorites.",1415836800,,698,4.323076923076923

4823737,4,B005LAJ1PE,"If you like a lot of creepiness, sex, psychotic activities, mad scientists, dead things (including babies) and just plain haunted house thrills then American Horror Story, Season I, Murder House is for you.

The Harmon family: Ben (Dylan McDermott, Vivien (Connie Britton) and Violet (Taissa Farmina) cross country from Massachusetts to LA after mom has a miscarriage and dad has an affair.  They move into a mansion that has a history of bizarre deaths by murder or suicide.  Neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange) has a habit of dropping in unannounced and seems to know a little too much about the life and lore of the previous occupants.  My favorite character is the housekeeper Moira (Frances Conroy/Alexandra Beckenridge) who comes along with the purchase.  She appears old and matronly to the women of the house but Oh-la-la seductive to the men.

If you're looking for a little cringe worthy TV viewing and like to be frightened this first season of American Horror Story will have you leaving the lights on at night.",1415145600,,1022,4.982352941176471

Ben should practice psychiatry from the spiritual realm in his home office on living clients. Who'd know he and his family were ghosts? He would earn enough to maintain Murder House and secure the survival of the ghosts who reside there. Violet and Beauregard can play and the usual spooky escapades can entertain bed and breakfast guests in the spirit of the movie 1408. It'd be great.

Season 1 is the only season I've missed of American Horror Story and it was well worth watching every episode. Scary? Nah.  Creepy and weird?  Indeed.

Not only is this a scary show, but it's one that doesn't involve blood and guts, or crazy demonic crap. It is a show that includes horror, suspense, drama, comedy, and so much more!! Once I start watching it, I can't seem to pry myself away very easily.  PLEASE DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW... IT IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!",1414886400,,450,4.625
4823873,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Other than a bit of redundancy, Season 1 (HAUNTED HOUSE) of AHS has broken new ground of freaky/scary. Season 2 (ASYLUM) was just as interesting and well-acted all around. Season 3 (COVEN) was super freaky with the witches. Kathy Bates truly stole the show as  Madame Delphine LaLaurie (a real crazy person). Watching Season 4 (FREAKSHOW) online and I'm not finding it as inventive or well-casted as the first three. They use some real physically challenged actors, yet the story line is lacking. I hope the rest is more interesting. Truthfully, I do not know where the creators will go after Freakshow (Season 4).",1414886400,,614,4.903846153846154

While I agree they were starting to run out of road with that particular story in season one, the Characters themselves had plenty of room for continued development. I'm not happy that those characters are gone (several of them, anyway). At least some of the actors that portrayed my favorite characters are in other seasons, but I'm still a bit foiled over it. I still have season 3 and 4 to watch, so I'll reserve my judgement about the show as an ""Anthologies"" but unless they really step it up, I think I'll always feel cheated.

Its definitely not the kind of show you will watch with the whole family, because its very graphic, spooky, twisted, adult language, drugs, smoking, and nudity.

4824060,2,B005LAJ1PE,"I wanted to like it, but there where so many things I just didn't love or enjoy.  I prefer my ""horror,"" a little more subtle and suspenseful.  The ghostly characters where all involved in the lives of the living, which didn't create much fear for me personally.  I also tend to be a plot person, I didn't really care for the plot (it really was sadly too predictable, I guessed every outcome). I didn't grow to like the characters, and their interaction with one and other was infrequent (between family members) and disconnected, just odd at best.  I suppose that perhaps they wanted to put more into creating a story about the house and the deaths of those trapped in it, but even those seemed disconnected in the story.  Also, I personally found the sexual content to be distracting in that it was boring (predictable) and wasn't the reason I wanted to watch a ""horror story,"" it really brought the -get on with it- moments to me, but to each their own I suppose.  I won't won't spend extra money to watch additional seasons, I might watch the others that are included in prime to see if it gets any better...",1414368000,,1112,4.507462686567164

If you liked Twin Peaks and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, this show is definitely for you!  It's sick, twisted and bizarre, but I loved every minute of it.  Some of the best parts are the ""hidden"" jokes that are just as shocking as the rest of the show, if nothing else because they take you completely by surprise!  Being the movie fanatic that I am, I also appreciated the homage to many horror movies from the past...whether they're intentional or not I'm not sure, but I could certainly pick them out, and that was part of the fun.  I enjoyed Dylan McDermott in Hostages, and became an even bigger fan of his after was his portrayal in this too.  I recommend giving this a go, but be sure to prepare yourself beforehand, as nothing is off the table in here... :)",1412121600,,876,4.3765432098765435

And it is really CREEPY, at times. Yet, it keeps me watching more of it. Yeah, watching it and not wanting to. Ugh! Shudder! Certain stories like this is not my cup of tea. However, I don't know why but this series draws you in. When there's a program or movie that does this to their audience it's telling you something. Like actors that can play a role that would make you hate them. American Horror Story is a thriller, suspenseful, and intriguing. Great writers, actors, etc. Watch it. For the squeamish like me, try it. TV doesn't have too many shows that are different in the respect of being spooky scary thrillers. It's a nice change.? Am up to season 1 episode 7.

4825363,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Just when you thought you had seen it all; you haven't seen anything yet.  The dark evil aura of Hollywood which has been fodder for Raymond Chancellor and other authors gets one upped in a tale of a Haunted House where death dwells.  Beyond anything Stephen King could ever dream is a fresh twist on the old tried and true conventions of horror and ghost stories that turns the genre upside down.  There are so many layers to AHS; the Battle between the Sexes, Good and Evil. Life and Death, Reality and the Superreality.  Solid perfromances all around especially Jessica Lange who gives Oscar Calibre Performance in a TV Series.  I sat riveted for hours.

4825742,5,B005LAJ1PE,"The story telling strategy and time line, along with the content of course. Will make this series one of the most celebrated for its innovation. The horror genre has always been a favorite of mine. But boobs and blood can only take me so far. This series has so many twists that you can never know what is going to happen next. You may get lucky and guess. But you can never confidently know what is about to happen next. This series is pure genius. And for it to be available on TV, is a stroke of luck for us all.",1403913600,,515,4.108910891089109

4825744,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I wasn't sure about this one - but as I'm a bit of a die-hard horror buff thought I'd give it a try. Worth a watch, and you won't have to view the entire season to know whether you like it or not. It will either grab you for the duration or kill your interest by episode 3.",1403827200,,273,3.7241379310344827
4825745,5,B005LAJ1PE,It was scary enough to keep my interest but not so scary I couldn't watch it.  I'll watch it again.,1403740800,,99,3.95
4825746,5,B005LAJ1PE,Amazing And Unexpected Twists And Turns. Loved This Season And Highly Recommend. I Was Surprised AT All The Cameo apperences,1403568000,,124,5.25
4825747,5,B005LAJ1PE,Absolutely beautiful.  The settings and actors alone make this worth watching.  The story line is interesting and can be scary. A fun way to pass some time.,1403308800,,156,4.7407407407407405
4825748,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I actually started with season 3 which was phenomenal, so of course I wanted to see how it began. Really addictive, watched it over the course of three days, didn't want to stop.",1403136000,,178,4.424242424242424

4825750,5,B005LAJ1PE,It was astonishing to see all the events that happened from past to present and the craziness throughout the whole show. And it seemed like almost all the actors in that show stepped up their game. It's really a great show PERIOD!,1403049600,,230,4.5
4825751,4,B005LAJ1PE,"This series was incredibly entertaining and is great for marathon watching.  I thought the ending was kind of stupid, but all things have to come to a conclusion, I guess.",1402617600,,171,4.7
4825752,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I loved this show out of all the American Horrors I think this was my favorite  - though I go back and forth - the only reason I stepped back and gave it four stars is that I felt it started out very strong and frightening and then toward the end it kind of felt either rushed or ""peetered out"" I don't know the exact terms to use - it just didn't end on the strength that it had begun but nonetheless it's a great show. This one centers on a family who moves into a haunted house - several aspects of it I adored - such as the maid looking all hot and sexy for the guys or people who ""couldnt see"" yet for people who were in total reality she was just an old woman so whenever someone hit on her the other people would look like HUH? it was very humorous and those that watched the show know what I am talking about - also hysterical was the ""ghost tour"" where they constantly pointed out that the house had multiple murders and the real estate agent constantly trying to downplay it - I thought that whoever played that real estate agent did a remarkable job at subtle (sometimes not so subtle) comedy - the scary scenes such as guest Eric Stonestreet were very scary -""here piggy pggy piggy"" - very well executed (pardon the pun!)
A must see and free to prime members - can't beat that!!",1402617600,,1290,4.16
4825753,5,B005LAJ1PE,This is my second time watching season one and I absolutely love it as much this go around as the last. It still sends shivers down my spine!,1402531200,,141,4.071428571428571

already have seen season 2 and 3...season 4 is going to be based on where I live Jupiter FL, but still shot in LA.
Florida is not giving the tax breaks that it should to bring the film industry back to the state.",1402531200,,291,3.7868852459016393
4825765,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Where have I been? I stumbled upon this show, trying to avoid doing my homework. What a pleasant surprise.  Just watch it! If you like True Blood and Dexter, you will love this show. It's waaaaay better!",1402444800,,203,4.486486486486487

4825767,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Ben and Vivien Harmon, (played by Dylan McDermott and Connie Britton) are a married couple, albeit ""unhappily"" married; move to LA after Ben ( a physichiatrist) has an affair with one of his students and Vivien suffers a miscarriage late in her pregnancy.  Along with their  teenage daughter, Violet (a cutter) they move into a mansion known as ""Murder House"" due to it's violent past residents. The house is it's own character in the storyline, as you will see right from the first 5 minutes of watching.  Jessica Lange is Constance, the Gladys Kravitz of the neighborhood, and she knows a lot more about the house then the present residents.  This is by far the best AHS so far (Season 4 starts Fall 2014), if you have not seen this yet, you are really missing out!",1402358400,,767,4.617647058823529
4825768,5,B005LAJ1PE,Loved it just that long movie reality feeling can't stop watching it gives me something to look up to every night,1402358400,,113,4.428571428571429
4825769,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Season one of AHS is perhaps the single best season of any show I have ever watched.  I remember eagerly awaiting the premiere of this show on television, and now owning it on DVD, I can watch it whenever!  There are so many things to enjoy about this season - it is unlike anything else I have ever seen, it truly keeps you on the edge of your seat.",1402272000,,350,4.057971014492754
4825770,3,B005LAJ1PE,"The 3rd season is by far the best! Season was good, but season one? Not so good plus my DVD froze up in places & skipped which season 2 did not.",1402099200,,144,3.6774193548387095
4825771,4,B005LAJ1PE,not as good as season 2 or 3 but a decent watch. I think season 2 was the best one of the three so far,1402012800,,102,3.12
4825772,5,B005LAJ1PE,"For the longest time, my partner and I stay away from watching this show due to the title of the show. We are not into horror or anything scary that might get our poor little hearts racing. But after hearing several raving reviews about this show, we finally put our fears aside and watched the first episode - we became hooked. It's not a show I'd watch a lone, or too late into the night, as there are definitely creepy scenes (""here piggy, piggy"") but the acting, the characters and the storyline is worth watching.",1401840000,,518,4.463157894736842
4825773,5,B005LAJ1PE,Basically that sums up the show. It was a wild ride I enjoyed it. Some of the twists were really out there (I know it's paranormal) but they were so memorable. If you're into paranormal shows and are looking to be entertained and not over examine every small detail then this will be a treat.,1401753600,,292,4.327272727272727
4825793,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I am a prolific horror story reader and I suppose that's what got me to try this show out.
I begins as a story about a family falling apart because of a tragedy and an affair, but the viewer quickly realises it is far more complicated than that.
I have watched all 3 seasons, enjoying 1 & 3 the most.
If I say more I will inadvertently spoil the story.

------possible spoiler-------
Be aware that overall the series is extremely graphic. The is also a detailed rape scene that I honestly couldn't  watch, though it was integral to the story, so I cannot say it shouldn't have been there.
Really, if you enjoy true, gut wrenching terror, give this a try.",1401667200,,654,4.396694214876033

4825801,4,B005LAJ1PE,Intriguing to say the least. While a bit 'out there' it's right where I am an I find it entertaining though it's not for everyone. The Horror is more drama than horror with an attempt to shock such that it hits different folks differently.,1401148800,,239,4.454545454545454

4825835,5,B005LAJ1PE,"A clever, very-well written and terrifically-acted program that has advanced the horror story to a higher tier.  It tells its tales with dark humor against a genuinely creepy background that makes you shiver.",1400544000,,208,5.303030303030303

I liked that one and wanted more so I'm now on Murder House. It's my favorite of all 3. The writing, the creepiness, the acting all is superb. I can't get enough. LOVE IT.

Better than any recent horror film by a country mile .",1398556800,,305,4.1
4825936,4,B005LAJ1PE,This show is working its way into my favorites list. Top rate acting and direction plus stories that grab you from the first scene - try it and you'll like it..,1398470400,,160,4.193548387096774
4825937,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Loved this series.  The inter-weaving of the past and present and how they interacted was brilliantly executed.  The suspense was palpable.  The violence of the horror was implied and the on screen gore left it to the viewer to imagine just how bad it was.  I sometimes cringe at the overt gore in the horror genre, but American Horror Story gave just enough visual to make you cringe without making your have to turn your head or cover your eyes.  It left you in control of how deeply you wanted to experience the terror, but the suspense kept you on the edge of your seat.  I think I watched the entire season in three days because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  The weaving of a real life unsolved mystery into the plotline was very well played.  Definitely worth viewing!",1398470400,,792,4.489510489510489
4825938,3,B005LAJ1PE,I think this would be best viewed as a set of movies. First one was hard to follow in chopped up segments,1398470400,,105,3.8181818181818183

4825940,3,B005LAJ1PE,"The storyline started out really good, creepy, and scary but as the season progressed it just got sillier and sillier.  At the same time the storyline was becoming more ridiculous, the characters appeared to be trying to be more serious - but not scary.  Hello! It's called American Horror Story not American Soap Opera in a Haunted House Story.  By the last three or four episodes it was borderline ""Scary Story"" funny (due to the absurdities of the story) and Days of Our Lives melodramatic.  Hoping that Season 2 will be better and scary throughout.",1398384000,,552,4.778947368421052

4825943,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I first started to watch AHS during the 4th season. I enjoyed it so I started watching all the episodes from season 1. It's a great series, but it's different because each season is self contained. Which means from season to season the actors are the same but they play different characters in a different story line. So you don't have to start with season 1, it doesn't matter which order you decide to watch them in. Try watching through Amazon Fire TV, good quality and easy menus. Fire TV is great and you can't beat the price. Plus no additional monthly fees, games aren't bad either and a lot are free.",1398211200,,608,4.4375

4826030,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I really enjoyed this. In my opinion, the first series was the most coherent, entertaining one of all. One of my main complaints with this series has been that the writers are too ambitious, constantly trying to introduce to many plot threads and then failing to tie them together (my main complaint with Season 2) or conclude them in a satisfying way for the viewer. This story made the most sense, although they started to veer off course with the Black Dahlia thing. What was the point of that? I don't know but that aside, it was a lot of fun to watch.",1397174400,,556,4.407766990291262
4826031,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Need I say more? I watched American Horror in reverse. I was first introduced to it via Season 3 Coven. I liked Coven so much that I went backwards and bought Seasons 1 & 2 to play catch up. It's interesting to see how the characters appearing in Season 3 Coven, have developed & how they're introduced in Season 1. However, in comparing Seasons 1 & 3 (I have not seen Season 2 yet), I think the writers/producers/directors really got their story line down & developed a much more interesting & twisted plot by Season 3 Coven. Season 1 is good but not nearly as compelling as Coven. If I had seen Season 1 first, I may not have followed through. I am intrigued to see what Asylum will bring.",1397088000,,691,4.323076923076923

4826033,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I love this show, you never know what is coming.  The story line was surprising and different, made me want more.  Don't know if, subsequent seasons will stand up because this one is tough to top.",1397088000,,196,4.416666666666667
4826034,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Full disclosure, I love the horror genre. Nevertheless, this series is above and beyond excellent. The writing is terrific. The music is terrific. The acting is terrific.

4826049,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Such a great series!  Though I have to say Season 2 Asylum is still my favorite.  Jessica Lange steals the show (again).  Creepy, strange, violent, weird, bloody, odd .. all the stuff I love along with a fantastic set, amazing acting by all and some good twists.  And a few oh no they didn't! moments.  The dog stunt, no I didn't like that one bit.  But overall, this was not what I was expecting from a ""network"" type show - even though it's cable, it's not premium where you can have a more anything goes kind of show happen.

Have not been able to watch season 3 yet, hoping that it will become available on Prime before season 4 starts - that I'll be watching weekly.  Yes, I did get to the party late.  But better late than never.",1396828800,,735,4.23021582733813

4826053,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Although they say it doesn't matter in which order you watch the AHS seasons, I do think those who started with season one have a greater appreciation of what the show is and does, as well as how the storytelling evolves over the seasons.

I liked ""Murder House.""  To me, it had a clear beginning, middle, and ending.  The parts of the story which were standalone were good and the overall, more serialized portions of the story were also good.  There were times, however, where I was watching the show like ""Really?  REALLY?"" but those were really storyline issues.  (Which gives it four stars rather than five.)

The acting was PHENOMENAL.  I can't think of a single person who was bad.  I even enjoyed Michael Graziadei's few lines.

All in all, solid show with solid performances and mostly good wrting.",1396742400,,807,4.7

And fast! I almost want to give this 5 stars. But, it's not quite ""perfect"", if you know what I mean. DEFINITELY a SOLID 4. Maybe even 4 1/2. Original, sexy, interesting, envelope pushing. Highly recommended to the horror and macabre enthusiasts.",1396656000,,414,4.608108108108108

I kept thinking and secretly hoping that SOMEHOW Season 1 would give me a clue to the characters in Season 3.  That is, considering many of the actors are in both seasons.

The story line bounced around from good to blah as quickly as the cuts which were there for the original advertisements when shown on television.  Sometimes the story was excellent, other times it waned into the world of ""What were you thinking?"".

4826102,5,B005LAJ1PE,"The show is creepy but completely addictive!  It starts slow, then you get into it.  The end seemed to wrap up quickly but none-the-less it went where you did not think it would go.  Plan to watch the second season soon.",1395878400,,220,4.317073170731708
4826103,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Very entertaining flick for someone that is not fond of the horror genre because I find the type of films annoying from ""need to leave this is so awful - Blair Witch Project"" to ""insert most horror flicks because they are shallow and boring.""  This series has more depth to characters and interesting twisted interpersonal drama.",1395878400,,329,4.875
4826104,3,B005LAJ1PE,"Horror or slasher?  Don't worry it is a rhetorical question.
With elements of both this show is sure to entertain as many as it alienates.

I loved it once I got used to the set up of lets blur the lines, incorporate as much as we can and introduce a cast with whom people will not be able to identify and thus making the ""killing your darlings"" impossible.

A cult classic I am sure!

4826106,5,B005LAJ1PE,I didn't want this season to end! I've watched the 2nd and 3rd season but never saw the 1st season. It was great to see how the actors have grown in their new roles over all the seasons.,1395705600,,186,3.9210526315789473
4826107,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I was completely captivated. I missed this first season when it was originally broadcast and streamed it after watching the second season--""Asylum"" on TV. Both are truly amazing pieces of art/entertainment. While I occasionally dabble in the ridiculous gore of a slasher film, I must say that I much prefer a thought-provoking horror story. The opening title sequence is chilling and is reminiscent of the brand of bristling, unsettling, unidentifiable creeps I felt through THE RING. The twists and turns here are truly divine and worthy of the hours spent watching. Terrific if not bizarre to the end, this one--just like its follow-up season--challenges viewers with unsettling and yet sympathetic characters. Of special note, ""Constance"" (Jessica Lang) and ""Tate"" (Evan Peters)--I found myself so pushed and pulled by these characters that I thought I might be going a little mad myself. Quite honestly in awe of this series.

**The sexualized nature was to the extreme. Definitely MATURE. Important distinction: sexual content was prevalent but not gratuitous--it was germane to the story being told.",1395705600,,1105,5.38728323699422

Season 2, Asylum  was so incredible I had to find a way to go back to the first season.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, I was finally able to do that.  The first season was as good, if not better than the second.  The story line was rich and diverse.  The characters were all spectacular and you never wanted any episode to end.

4826188,1,B005LAJ1PE,Don't know what it is about and don't care. My guess is its a show for people who are scared of and intimidated by reality; people who long for the time when they had a boogieman in their closet and mommy would come in and make it all better.,1394582400,,242,3.9591836734693877

American horror movies have mostly become depraved torture scenes, softcore porn, and tension-less gimmicks, so even if it was painful to watch, the best that can be said about this show was that it was titled correctly.",1393891200,3,362,4.584615384615384

4826277,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I heard about the show from a friend and started the first season on Netflix. I was amazed by everything in the first season. I was extremely addicted to it. The story about the house and family is amazing. I have to watch the coven, almost done with the second season with the asylum.",1393632000,,285,4.296296296296297

4826291,2,B005LAJ1PE,"American Horror Story Season 1 is attempting horror but it is over the top. In trying to horrify the viewer it became comedic. They are throwing everything but the kitchen sink to make our hairs stand on end and get us creeped out. For me, it didn't work. I found this episode more on the comedy side and I probably won't check out the rest of the season. Horror boring.",1393632000,,370,4.3

4826298,5,B005LAJ1PE,"it was ghostly and well written.

4826311,5,B005LAJ1PE,After watching a few episodes of Coven I went back and watched seasons 1 & 2 of AHS.  I love how the story lines develop throughout the season and only little bits and pieces are revealed.  It's a little twisted but enjoyable!,1393459200,,226,4.357142857142857
4826312,4,B005LAJ1PE,This is a very well done serial horror story with multiple plot lines and character development.  Well acted and written.  What I never understand is why in these ghost stories they NEVER GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.....looking forward to catching up on the other seasons...,1393459200,,267,4.911111111111111
4826313,4,B005LAJ1PE,Definitely not for the squeamish but very entertaining if you like this type of show.  Took away a star because the final episode was really lame.,1393459200,,146,4.615384615384615

4826340,5,B005LAJ1PE,Totally original for TV. Its amazing how creepy and twisted every moment of the show is. Twists around every corner.,1393286400,,116,4.85

4826342,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Watched season one consecutively during one of many snowy weekends. We had to see what was going to happen next.

4826343,2,B005LAJ1PE,"Way too much sex for my liking.  Story gets lost.  I really enjoyed the second and third season, so I thought I would watch this one.  Thought it would be good, because first seasons are usually the best ones.  This one was very disappointing.  They should have expanded the story more and left out the sex.",1393286400,,307,4.410714285714286
4826344,3,B005LAJ1PE,"This series was somewhat enjoyable in spite of the poor writing. The actors do an excellent job, but it's unfortunate that with a plot like this, the series never had a chance. Five stars for the acting and no stars for the plot.",1393200000,,229,4.348837209302325

4826349,3,B005LAJ1PE,"They have a great premise here and plenty of plot twists but nearly from the beginning they try to shove a little too much in and don't seem to follow their plot points. One episode something huge is revealed and then the next 5 you see characters seemingly forget the major plot twist that just happened.. It feels like the story is being pulled in too many directions and the writers run with it and let the plot holes appear as they are. Even the ending left so many questions. (Where's the baby? What's going on with Payton/why is she basically silent at the end? Why is everyone magically so happy and their problems are all gone?).
That being said it's an interesting enough story. It's filled with suspense and they do a good job of reworking classic horror themes. It's very entertaining, just don't expect a seamless story line.",1393200000,,837,4.586666666666667
4826350,4,B005LAJ1PE,Original take on an old story.  Quality actors for the most part.  I watched the first season in one sitting.,1393200000,,109,4.4
4826351,5,B005LAJ1PE,Creepy and suspenseful.  Kept my attention.  I watched the entire season in four days since I just had to know what happened.,1393200000,,125,4.636363636363637

4826353,4,B005LAJ1PE,An interesting storyline that caters to some pretty traditional beliefs of the supernatural side and how they come about. You'll say huh? And OH! ad say them together frequently.,1393113600,,178,5.172413793103448

4826379,5,B005LAJ1PE,Just started watching the latest season and liked it so had to go back to where it all started.  Gory but keeps you interested enough to keep watching to see what's next.,1393027200,,170,4.3125

4826384,1,B005LAJ1PE,This show sucks. The story is killed because ghosts can pop up whenever they want. Game over. No resolution. It is cheating the story.,1392940800,,134,4.625

CSI, NCIS, Major Crimes, Law and Order, etc. there may be a few variances but all the same story lines. this show was new and fresh. kept my attention. liked that it wasn't geared toward the 13-something crowd nor did it featured only young beautiful bodies.",1392940800,,344,4.564516129032258

4826394,4,B005LAJ1PE,"If you like Stephen King stories then this show is for you. If you are not a fan of the horror genre then you will likely find it too gruesome. The acting overall is good. Especially outstanding are Jessica Lange as the bitchy next door neighbour, and whoever it is who played the older version of the maid. (The younger version of the maid is also nice to watch.) The after life for those who die in the ""Murder House"" is interesting: they, a la ""Hotel California"", can check out, but they can never leave.",1392940800,,507,4.347368421052631

So I've now committed myself to going back to the previous seasons and watching what I've missed.  Why did no one tell me about this show?  It's AMAZING and I love the story lines.  It's one of the best written and inventive shows on the air.  Each Season stands alone, so you can skip anything you don't care for, but it's nice to come back something I've missed and see where everything ties in.",1392768000,,494,4.268817204301075

4826417,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I find that America is at times a horror story of its own making. We allow ourselves to be convinced that we should have people cut us up so that we look more alike, we worship largely talentless musicians while extraordinary talents go unrewarded, and we allow our politics to define us rather requiring politics to be defined by us. It is nice to see what we can really do. With the onslaught of reality TV it is nice to see a well made documentary that really speaks to the soul of the american public by showing some things that they really should be afraid of. Fiscal cliff, Shmiscal Fliff... These stories are the things to really be afraid of!",1392768000,,650,4.425

4826422,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I did not purchase this show through Amazon (sorry Amazon, I just rented it, however I enjoyed it enough to consider the purchase).  This is a television show; however there is strong sexual content, graphic violence, and coarse language.  You have been warned.  Now, with that being said, this had to be one of the most intriguing shows I have watched!  There is mystery, suspense, and an amazing plot.  I really enjoy the cast; from what I can tell, they mostly use the same people under a different plot each season, although they have different guest stars. I read some complaints on bad acting, I disagree.  I thought the cast was amazing and believable.  I missed this season on television so I have been playing catch up.
This story takes place in Los Angeles California.  The show follows a family (Mom, Dad and an Emo teenage Daughter) who moved from the East Coast following a tragedy in their family.  They bought a beautiful turn of the century home that has an interesting history.  The history of the home is unveiled a little at time each episode and interesting people turn up, each has their own story somehow connecting them to the house.
Personally, I love horror type movies, but if you're sensitive to coarse language, violence, or sexual content- do not watch this show.  I did find some of the content disturbing, but not enough to make me turn off the show.  If you are a little more immune to this type of content, this show was very entertaining!  I chose to give this series five stars because I enjoyed the plot, the cast, and I couldn't wait to watch the next episode.",1392681600,,1597,4.6007067137809186
4826423,5,B005LAJ1PE,I first watched season 3 when it aired on TV (Coven) and thought it was pretty good.  I heard that season 1 was amazing and they were correct.  This season is my favorite so far.  It just keeps you wanting more and the story line is SO GOOD.  Watch it!,1392681600,,252,3.98

4826427,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I found the series on satellite in its fourth season (Coven)....I  was hooked!  I went in to see what else was ""on demand"" and found season one on Amazon.com.....wow!  It's one of the best written, best acted, best directed and certainly one of the best produced  series in the gothic genre that I've found anywhere!  I love the fact that you can go in and do almost 500 minutes ""in one sitting""  (truly, I got started and sat for two days watching it chapter by chapter until it was done!).  Don't know if I'll be as impressed by the second and third season --- but I will now give it a try.  Jessica Lang is amazing (but so are all the rest!)!  This is a good gothic story with adult themes and intelligence.  I love being able to ""suspend my disbelief"" and not be taken jerkily off track by being sent down into the kiddy lanes.  This is good, adult viewing!",1392681600,,861,4.285714285714286

In typical horror movies, the audience only gets a brief look into the characters and their pasts, in a tv series the audience has the chance to build more attachment to the characters by learning their strengths/flaws/pasts in deep detail with each episode.  American Horror Story is a refreshing new take on horror/thriller/suspense, highly recommend this series!  Plus, there's Dylan McDermott -- need I say more?",1392249600,,506,5.072289156626506

I found it well done, of course it IS a comedy, but there are moments when I was taken back by the unexpected. I like the way it uses persons from all walks of life.

I like being able to just sit back and let the show take hold. And there is always enough to make me want to go on to that next episode. (I was really surprised when I found how who the guy in the black plastic suit was!) The maid character is choice. But Jessica aptly holds the whole thing together, a matriarch of horror!

In my opinion AHS has brought something to TV hat has never been brought before. Just the fact that the show totally reinvents itself every season speaks volumes. It also doesn't hurt that each season just gets better and better. AHS is definitely not for the queasy or faint of heart though. This season (season one)  while not being extremely gory as in blood and  guts like season 2 and 3, it is still all kinds of delightfully twisted and disturbing :-) I love it!

There was parts that even me, the predictable next scary part was so shocking at times that I literally would have cold chills for at least 5 minutes. If you want a horror story then this is definitely a horror story. Definitely. I give 5 stars. And I wish I could be a spoiler and tell you what all happened but you must watch for yourselves.

4826563,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Season One is much better than Season Two(I couldn't even watch past Episode 3-way too graphic for me!). I give Season One 4 stars mostly because of the actors-especially Jessica Lange. The story is very interesting ,but towards the end the violence tends to be a little too graphic,but I was still glued to my TV until the end.",1391817600,,328,4.576271186440678

4826568,5,B005LAJ1PE,I didn't watch until this season. I like witch stories so I gave it a try. Held my attention week after week. Really hated to see it end but it did end well. Answered all the questions yet could do another season with some different cast members. Would like to see a Kathleen Turner type brought in. Give it a try Coven will impress.,1391731200,,333,4.21875

Clever writing, plot twists, and greatly timed character reveals make this show a must watch for fans of the genre. A warning for some people, this show has morbid plot lines and can be graphic at times, not for sensitive or weak stomached people. The only thing that I personally didn't like in the show was the use of an actual famous murder they tried to tie into the show, to me it seemed out of place and unnecessary. I would maybe dock half a star for that at most considering the rest of the shows content is entertaining. Watched via Amazon Instant Video.",1391558400,,658,4.491666666666666

It's hard to keep up with who's dead and who isn't.  I love Jessica Lang and the different way they keep the same cast in other story lines is awesome.  I can't wait for the next season and the next and the next and the next.

The only issue I have is not with American Horror Story but with Amazon.  Because we have to wait so long to see the next episode.

4826639,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Interesting approach, considering it is a horror story. If you are afraid of finding something worse than watching other serial killers series, don't be worried anymore. There are much more blood in many other movies I have seen before. Of course you are going to catch you thinking about of what is reality, or if there is a parallel world we cannot see, or if there is a redemption for humans in the spiritual world. Overall it entertained me and I might go for the Season 2.",1391472000,,477,4.494252873563219

4826641,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Well crafted and well acted!  The cast is incredible, for starters.  All A list and acting always makes a difference in my opinion.  The story line is reminiscent of a collection of many horror stories combined into one (a little Rosemary's baby, a little 6th Sense, a little The Omen, etc) but it is done cleverly and definitely packs surprises.  Some of it is predictable, but there are twists and turns that leave you longing to see the next episode.

But the twists, turns and surprises of the plot keeps you glued to the screen - in an I'm horrified, but can't look away sort of allure.

Overall, I'd say I liked this season and season 2 AHS Asylum nearly equally. AHS Coven was my least favorite of the seasons, so far. I just hope Jessica Lange keeps coming back!",1391385600,,492,4.290322580645161

Admittedly, in the lasdt decade there have been a very few, quality horror films; my favorites ""The Ring"", ""Paranormal Activity"" 1-4, ""The Grudge"", and the remakes of ""The Wolfman"", and ""The Haunting"".  I've only seen season 1 of ""American Horror Story"", but have been well impressed, and I anticipate each episode after I've watched the last one.  It truly is one of the best haunted house series I've seen. It has a flirtatious relation to Stephen Kings ""Rose Red"", but instead of the house being continually constructed, there is a host of paranormal sexual encounters that only add to the theme of theme of the series.  If you have an appreciation for quality haunted house films, you will love ""American Horror Story.""",1391299200,,897,4.881578947368421

4826727,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I have never been a big fan of horror movies or shows.
In all honesty, I avoid watching those kinds of shows and movies at all costs. I never in a million years thought I would want to watch American Horror Story. When I first heard about it, I instantly told myself I would never even come close to watching it.
As of today, I have finished watching all three seasons that have aired on television and am now re-watching the first season. Every series of this show has caught my attention and has surprised me at every turn. Although I absolutely hate being scared, this TV series not only had great plot lines in each season, but also taught lessons and had deeper meanings in every episode.
American Horror Story is a television series which has a different storyline for every season. The first season was just called American Horror Story, which was about a house that was haunted by evil spirits, and the familys experience while living there. The next two were called Asylum and Coven. Asylum was about a mental hospital and the story of two main characters who get wrongfully admitted to the haunted and corrupted hospital. Coven was about a witch coven, and the young witches trying to survive in New Orleans while under attack by two separate forces. These descriptions of course are very vague, as to not give away any parts of the TV series that might ruin the show.
The part of American Horror Story that really caught my attention was the fact that every season hosted the same actors, just as different characters, each season. I had never seen a show that had done something like that before. I also got very invested in certain characters while watching the show, and felt like I was in touch with what they were feeling and experiencing, which was mostly fear in this case, but was not something I had felt when watching other horror movies or TV series. I believe that because of this connection I had with the characters in each season, as well as the interesting plot lines and deeper meanings in each episode, that I was able to look past the fear aspect and enjoy the show for what it was, which is amazing.
If I were to recommend a TV series to anyone looking for something to Netflix binge on, this would be your show. The first two seasons are available on Netflix, and the third season should be up soon. The fourth season is still undecided, no one knows what it will be called or what time period it will be placed in, but a fourth season is definitely happening, which is one of the most exciting things for me.
The only thing I suggest for a person wanting to start this television series is that, if possible, try to watch this show with a friend or a significant other. It makes the show less scary when you have someone to freak out with when something scary happens or a huge plot twist occurs. Happy watching and enjoy!",1390953600,,2855,4.492307692307692

4826729,4,B005LAJ1PE,This show kept me coming back to watch again and again. To think that the story mainly revolved around one house could be so intriguing and at times captivating.

4826751,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I started watching AHS at the beginning of the second season and loved it. I've been watching the current third season on TV and have been disappointed. However, this first season makes up for the lame third season going on right now.",1390867200,,234,4.595238095238095
4826752,5,B005LAJ1PE,I love American Horror Story. Great series!  Constantly on the edge of my seat while watching.  I highly recommend it.,1390867200,,118,4.85
4826753,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I love scary movies and this was done very well, just a little too much gore in the second series especially, and way too much gratuitous sex. The series would have been just as scary and in my opinion, probably better without them.",1390867200,,232,4.4186046511627906
4826754,5,B005LAJ1PE,I watched some of this series but my husband was captivated and watched the entire series episode after episode. He says it was the best.,1390867200,,137,4.52

4826756,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Ok, where to start. A sick, twisted, deeply disturbing plot that keeps you entranced and wondering what over the top scene is coming next. Disturbing in the most horrific way! These short stories are sure to delight those fellow viewers who share my same passion for what horror films/shows should be . The kind where you sit down at work, school, dinner etc....and still reminisce about the last show you watched. A truly engaging series!",1390867200,,439,4.866666666666666
4826757,5,B005LAJ1PE,I definitely would suggest this for everyone who likes plot twists and for a mature audience as some scenes are graphic.  The characters are easy to follow and the stories are great.  I could not stop watching episodes.,1390867200,,219,4.7368421052631575
4826758,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Addictive,  strange, sexy.  I kept watching and enjoyed this 1st season of this show even though I thought the writing could have been better.  The characters are acted and written well.  I thought That Dylan's character didn't fit as a therapist, but you figure all therapists are off a little then he fits.  The other actors were all perfectly cast Connie Britton, Jessica Lang, and the actors (can't remember names) that played Lang's children daughter and troubled son and Violet Dylan and Britton's daughter.  It's not really scary, but twisted and creepy.  I've not seen anything like it on TV since Tales From The Dark Side.  Unlike that show this one sticks with the same characters in the same haunted house bringing in more ghosts or creeps, twists and turns every week.  It's like a soap of Tales From the Dark Side, now if you liked that show and think you won't like this due to the ""soapyness"" give it a shot and let yourself get hooked.

4826780,5,B005LAJ1PE,I watch a lot of horror and this is truly scary and intense. You can feel the characters emotions as you watch as their lives slowly spiral out of control and you will love the twist in the last episode. I hope they make a part two with the same actors Tate is truly a horrific character that you can never figure out.,1390867200,,318,4.063492063492063
4826781,4,B005LAJ1PE,"The opening season American Horror Story shows great promise. The entire cast including Jessica Lange does a creditable job. The haunted house has a lot of stories to tell the audience. I would advise to watch all in sequence as each lead into one another. However, I was truly disappointed with the ending showing that the main familys conflict or dilemma somehow all works out. It could of continued to scare the crap out of the audience.",1390867200,,440,4.7272727272727275
4826782,5,B005LAJ1PE,"AHS S1 (Murder House) is a really good show with excellent acting IMO (Connie Britton, Dylan McDermott, AND OF COURSE Jessica Lange)!  We just finished S2 (Asylum) and it was good too, BUT S1 was so much better (completely different story line) as it was more relatable!  It is a thriller type show (not too scary, but DEF NOT for young kids).  There is blood and some pretty violent killings, but it's tastefully done (for killing...LOL!).",1390867200,,440,4.7631578947368425

You will never know what to expect with this one.  Anyone can die. Once you get used to going back and forth in time, it is easy to tell what is going on and to use the information to solve the many mysteries.  Great performances one and all!!",1390867200,,463,4.111111111111111

We do not have cable.
Husband decided to give it a shot...it is creepy as hell, and we are hooked!

DO NOT WATCH WITH KIDS AROUND!

4826802,4,B005LAJ1PE,Season 1 of American Horror Story was a pretty good ride all the way through. The story got a little convoluted but paid off if you stayed with it. There were some really intense moments. The creepy factor hit its limit on a few episodes. I will definitely be watching season 2.,1390867200,,278,4.365384615384615
4826803,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Great season.  After getting into season 3 I decided to watch the previous two seasons, and have enjoyed all of them.  I can definitely tell a difference between the three seasons and the way they have evolved, horror-wise, as a series.  Not as much blood and guts in season 1 as there are in seasons 2 and 3 (which is fine with me, really).  Overall, I'll be continuing as an AHS fan, and look forward to what storyline they cook up next.",1390867200,,439,4.317073170731708

I came here hoping to find some good reviews and a reason to continue with it, but alas many of you share my revulsion.  I am a big fan of thrillers and mysteries and had hoped this show would fit the bill, but it was so disturbing and over the top, I could not take it.

First, Season 1 is better than Season 3!  If you want a true haunted house story, with references to real life murder mysteries mixed in, this is for you.  There were a couple of episodes where I actually jumped!  Graphic and disturbing, but if you can stomach it, you will love it.",1390608000,,469,4.482352941176471

4826833,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This show is a frightening, wonderful, horrifying, heart-warming, nail-biting emotional roller-coaster ride that grips you by the teeth until the last episode.

Summaries have been stated in earlier reviews; the premise is simple. Man cheats on wife, man wants to make it up to wife, man, wife, and child move to L.A. And the place they start a new life is a property dubbed ""Murder House.""

Don't expect ""Murder House"" to model Paranormal Activities, A Haunting in Connecticut, or any typical ghostly horror: it follows nothing of that kind. It is a show that acts against any expectation you have of it.

The most gripping aspect of American Horror Story, however, isn't the bizarre, terrifying horror; what shines are the characters. The actors in the show all bring a level of humanity to their roles that create a reality within this impossible world. Through this, AHS becomes far beyond typical horror--the human themes woven throughout make this a story that everyone (to various degrees) can relate to. With their diverse range of characters they tackle difficult topics such as woman in society, adolescence, homosexuality, mental illness, affairs, and depression. However, most notably, there are no black and white characters. No character was purely evil--each had a complexity to them, a psyche which could be pulled apart and understood. Most notably, throughout the progression of the show I learned to hate characters I once loved and love characters I once hated; it is that sort of show.

The writing is fantastic; I never anticipated the twists in the plot. It was a story so addictive that although I was terrified to watch it at night, I could not manage to stop.

So please, do yourself a favor and watch American Horror Story. You will not be disappointed.",1390608000,,1780,5.0

I had seen many .GIFs on the internet about it, so the characters felt a bit familiar to me. After watching it, I can say that I loved the story.

I wouldn't label it a traditional horror story, but it contains a lot of those elements.  The characters and stories will definitely make you feel uncomfortable at times.

American Horror Story was so very well put together and written that each episode left me wanting for the next.  The actors were all first-class and had me sympathizing even when they were at their most wicked.  I LOVED the OMG moment in Episode 10! Did not see that coming at all.  And I loved the finale.  It was a fun, ""happy-ending"" for the Harmon family....which is twisted on my part because of the circumstances....oh well, ""life goes on""!

4826975,4,B005LAJ1PE,"For those of us who thought the horror genre was gone forever as serial television, AMERICAN HORROR STORY arrived to dispel that notion.  Innovative and creative--with the most jarring and disturbing opening credits sequence in all of television--AMERICAN HORROR STORY is about an old Gothic mansion in LA.  The house harbors dark forces so powerful that all its inhabitants succumb to terror and madness--all its inhabitants lose their lives, either at their own hands, or at the hands of others; to die in the ""Murder House"", as it is known to those familiar with its history, is to be eternally cursed.  The ghosts of those who have died in the house are condemned to remain there forever.  And the Harmon family from Boston, a troubled trio moving cross country for a much-needed fresh start, comprises the essence of the DVD collection for AMERICAN HORROR STORY - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON.

I had never seen this series when it made its original run on FX.  I received this 4-disc collection as a gift, and do I ever owe the giver some heartfelt gratitude.  The Harmons, psychiatrist Ben (Dylan McDermott), musician Vivien (Connie Britton), and their daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga), definitely need a change of scenery.  Ben has been unfaithful, while Vivien has just suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage.  They fall in love with an old, very unique house (constructed in the Twenties), and are surprised the sale price is so low.  When it's disclosed the previous owners have died in the house, they decide to take the home anyway.  The home ""comes"" with a housekeeper (Frances Conroy/Alexandra Breckenridge) who appears as a seductress to men, and as a matronly, elderly lady to women.  Headstrong next-door neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange) can't seem to stay away from the house, while troubled teen Tate (Evan Peters) becomes one of Ben's first patients, and becomes very attracted to Violet.  Finally, Ben is stalked by Larry (Dennis O'Hare), a horribly disfigured man who constantly warns Ben to take his family and flee the house.  This is the core cast as the series unfolds, with each succeeding episode introducing new characters--inhabitants from the past--and layer upon layer of storylines and subplots.  The episodes build to one very satisfying season finale.

I mentioned AMERICAN HORROR STORY is innovative and creative.  Is it ever.  The writing, acting, editing (particularly the jump-editing), camera angles, and effects create a disturbing and compelling effect.  This is one exceptionally-made series.  However, one star off for the plot and logistical inconsistences (and they stick out like a sore thumb), nuisances that will not take away from the overall enjoyment of this series.  Special features include an audio commentary of the opening episode by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, along with behind-the-scenes looks at the cast, crew, and a detailed discussion of the making of the disturbing opening credits.  AMERICAN HORROR STORY - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is a must-have for all horror buffs.

4827032,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Since I never got the opportunity to watch this on television, I decided to watch it through Amazon Prime. I must say that I am so glad that I did. From beginning to end, this entire series had me wondering what would happen next. Who says that the dead don't roam freely? Enter ""Murder House,"" a place where those who are killed in this beautiful house, are trapped forever. Not only are they trapped, but some are so wicked that they deem it necessary to inflict their fate on others.  Even Violet's (the Harmon daughter) gift is not enough to save her from the fate that awaits her and her family. To top it all off, there is the ever present Constance (played by Jessica Lange). She will make you respect and hate her; nevertheless, she is a winner. No matter what she is doing or has done, she possesses a sense of entitlement and seems to be running the show; she even gets to raise the beautiful the thing that will bring about mankind's demise.",1389744000,,952,4.409090909090909

4827118,2,B005LAJ1PE,It s creepy at first and rather confusing. Turns out to be some stupid family where practically everyone is dead or dies. 100% predictable. 2 stars cuz some things were cool. Alot of just weird stuff tho and lots of talking. Lots.,1389398400,,230,4.5
4827129,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I give it 4 stars because American Horror Story blends horror and drama almost seamlessly each episode. There are moments which are cliche, as if to be expected, but as the characters develop, my interest in the story grew deeper. Enjoy!",1389398400,,237,4.804878048780488

Too scared to keep watching but too excited to stop. No only do you get to see Dylan McDermott's naked arse but you get the equally sexy Alexandra Breckenridge in a french-maid uniform. Jessica Lange is absolutely spectacular - beautiful and mad.

This show is unlike any psycho-thriller I've seen. Stop reading this review and watch the damn show - you won't regret it.",1389312000,,544,4.787234042553192

4827169,4,B005LAJ1PE,It was off to a slow start but did pick up speed.  I didn't care for Season 2 at all.  It appears to use the same actors from season to season playing different roles so maybe pay attention to some of the characters when first watching the series.  Just sayin'.  Warning you cannot get Season 3 yet on Amazon Prime which is disappointing.,1389225600,,338,4.317460317460317
4827170,5,B005LAJ1PE,"It starts off super interesting and drops off a little by the end of the season. Totally worth watching, just know it starts off stronger than it ends",1389225600,,150,4.392857142857143
4827171,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Full of surprises!  The casting on this series is impressive.  I became a fan of American Horror Story during season two, and really enjoyed seeing the cast continue forward into a whole new story for season three.  When I realized I could watch season one with my Amazon Prime membership I was thrilled.  Many of the same folks have been with the show for all three seasons, which only adds to my enjoyment.  Same people, totally different characters!  And the story?  Dark, a little gruesome, and a surprise ending.  Watch it!",1389225600,,528,4.725274725274725

4827177,4,B005LAJ1PE,I almost wish that the season finale could have been as crazy as the whole season.  The twists and turns make it worth watching.  And my ability to do it all on my Kindle Fire made it a truly wonderful experience!,1389225600,,213,4.170731707317073

4827179,4,B005LAJ1PE,This is a very interesting series. It is not the typical Horror show or series. It verges more on the creepy vs. the blood and guts slasher. It will make you think and plays with the mind. I didn't think I would like it but have gotten hooked.,1389225600,,243,4.083333333333333

4827196,4,B005LAJ1PE,"The first few episodes contain a seemingly disjointed assortment of vignettes, but then evolve into a sophisticated network of relationships between the living and the dead.

However, I noticed there were three seasons to AHS, and my OCD told me to start at the beginning...Let me just say, I am SO GLAD I did!  The story simply draws you in!  I found myself hating one character one minute, loving them the next, and then hating them again, only to realize, I loved them all!  Then ending was a bit mellow, but the story as a whole was amazing!  I am almost done with AHS Asylum and I just started these a week ago.  Can't wait for Season 4 to find out what it will be about!",1389139200,,575,3.913793103448276
4827207,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I didn't watch this when it originally aired, but jumped into the franchise during season 3. I enjoyed it, so decided to come back and watch the first season. I enjoyed it, and was intrigued by the idea that the same actors okay different characters with a different story each season. Good concept, and the story was definitely creepy. Was kind of surprised it was on cable TV and not a premium channel. If you like sorta scary/creepy stuff and haunted houses/ghosts are your thing, check it out.",1389139200,,497,4.659090909090909

4827220,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Really enjoyed the ongoing/continuous story with the main characters interwoven with new plots based on the history of the house throughout the decades for each episode.  Definitely twisted, scary and keeps you interested and wanting to ""learn"" more with each episode.  While I believe the series lost a bit of steam In the last third of the series and you start to question the intelligence of many characters, it's still a series I'd recommend checking out if you're into horror movies and/or always enjoyed the horror episodes from say The Twilight Zone.  Jessica Lange is awesome and worth seeing it for her alone.",1389052800,,618,4.980582524271845

4827224,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I had heard this was a great show, but hadn't watched it till after the 3rd season had started. WOW, this show is very different than anything I've seen recently. The story lines are great, and the fact that the theme changes from season to season makes it even better. The show uses some of the same actors in different roles which is very interesting. Jessica Lange, who I had not seen in years is great in this show. A great and still sexy actress, she must not be missed. Check it out!!",1389052800,,490,4.279569892473118

4827229,5,B005LAJ1PE,"A perfect blend of the gruesome histories of the house with the everyday horrors that the living residents encounter and visit upon each other: dishonesty, refusal to forgive, deception, rejection, depression, loss of trust...

Some good scares, but not too gory... If you like violence porn if the ""Saw"" variety, you will be disappointed.

The masterful performances, especially by Ms. Lange, are masterful. Writing is strong, and there are some brilliant twists that had me yelling at the screen.",1389052800,,498,5.291139240506329

4827234,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Season 1 is a good start with flashbacks that help to bring the story to life and make the ending really good and enjoyable. It was sad that the family died but they remained together which I found to be very heartwarming especially with the baby. And the twists in the story, Elizabeth Shore - ""The Black Dahlia"", made this story life-like for me.",1388966400,,348,4.453125

I had not read or heard anything about the series and their methods nor writing.  However, once I understood there was no connection to the characters from one season to the next, I could not get enough.  As a matter of fact, I found that I quickly had no problem going from one season to another and getting the characters confused because of the use of the same actor.  The writing is just incredible.  The actors are superb.  I just can't say enough good about the series.  Must watch and keep watching.",1388880000,,648,4.38655462184874

4827277,3,B005LAJ1PE,"This is a new type of ghost story.  But, whether it is vampires in the Twilight series or ghosts in this show, I have trouble wrapping my mind around the concept of dead beings able to procreate.  Something beautiful (the birth of a child) does not come from something that is cursed and dead; with (vampires) or without (ghosts) bodies.  The story-line is hard to accept in this matter and is weakened overall by this situation.  The acting is good, but, I will not be interested in watching season two.",1388793600,,504,4.566666666666666

Season 1 of American Horror Story instantly grabs viewers like a spider drawing a hypnotized insect into its web.

4827282,4,B005LAJ1PE,"There were a lot of plot holes which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. It was an interesting ghost story, but I think the writers got too ambitious with the number of stories/ghosts they included.  I like the actors, the family drama, and the weird neighbors, but the ending was predictable and full of holes- like where did all the ghosts reside when we weren't seeing them? Why weren't they present more often? And really, detectives cannot be that stupid. It was a good decompression marathon for my winter break from school- not too much to think about and full of good-looking men.",1388793600,,585,4.571428571428571

4827289,5,B005LAJ1PE,I love this series!  I started watching season 3 on tv and then decided to go back and watch 1 and 2.  I think season 1 is my favorite so far!,1388793600,,142,3.5483870967741935
4827290,1,B005LAJ1PE,"There are NO ghosts and when you die you just rot in the earth AND psychoanalysts use the ancient superstition that you have a magical, self initiating force in your brain called a soul/will that gives you free willy SO everything about this show is a lie and sucks!  Plus, this show perpetuates assumptions that tell psychos (psychoanalysts), to blame you for your resulting behavior to enslave us all SO this show infects everyone. The best way to control anyone is too make them think they control their behavior:) You have a problem it is up to you to you to fix it, take some personal responsibility (LOL). Actually solving unhealthy behavior involves re-arranging the contingencies of reinforcement to reinforce healthy behavior, but that would take too much time, too many resources, and continuous adaption SO don't tell anyone the truth and keep reinforcing shows like American Horror Story that spew propaganda endlessly. Yes, doing what works is documented in The Reluctant Alliance: Behaviorism And Humanism, but that is too difficult SO don't tell anyone, let them keep watching shows like American Horror Story that make ignorance much easier and fun, we can be entertained while we do what fails (LOL).  It is also much easier to tell others to take responsibility and never take any responsibility SO American Horror Story continues shoving lies down our throats ad infinitum, it is easy and fun AND wins on every front.  Much more effective then telling you the facts. No problem ever gets solved, but the psychos get paid a ton to listen and you get to talk of taboo subjects in this culture and feel much better for an hour.  How great.  They don't have to do a thing, they put all the lies/ illusions on you.  You get to feel like you are solving problems, but actually you just schedule endless appointments and the vicious cycle never ends while shows like American Horror Story trumpet personal responsibility endlessly.  Yes, they do eventually criticize psychoanalysis, but still give it some credit while making sure they trumpet personal responsibility so this parasitic system always flourishes.  Everybody wins, we get to watch garbage entertainment like this show endlessly (LOL) AND psychoanalysis never dies!!! Viva La Psychos!

Hadn't seen it on TV, but wanted to begin watching, did so online with Season 1.  Was enough to keep me watching at the computer the entire day, completing Season 1 then moved onto Season 2.  Scary, thrilling, gross & obsene in it's presentation.  True horror.",1388448000,,391,4.705882352941177
4827357,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I had no idea what I was getting into with this show, all I knew was that the advertising campaign was the freakiest thing I've seen on a billboard since (insert joke here). But seriously, the ad campaign for this show is amaaaazing, kudos to them for risking something new and very post-modern on Main Street. Anyway, the first few episodes were great. Aside from Dylan McDermott's weak acting, I was really sucked in and legitimately scared when I watched the show. Then, somewhere around episode 6, the fear factor started falling apart and it just turned into a soap opera. The scary, disheveled basement became just another room for people to kill each other in, and the ""rules"" for what the ghosts of the house can and can't do, and where they can go started becoming really broad and unbelievable. Frankly, it just started to suck. Overall, as the season wore on they destroyed all of the mystique of the house and the show itself by turning to typical dramatic situations. I don't know what happened, but I'm disappointed because this season had a lot of potential to stay mysterious and engaging instead of falling apart into whatever Hallmark nonsense it ended with. Still, it's much better than most of the crap on cable, and the musical selections are stellar.",1388448000,,1272,4.760180995475113

4827397,2,B005LAJ1PE,"This is going to be a hard review for me to write on without sounding like a ""hater"". But it's so hard because there's just no other way to describe how I feel after watching American Horror Story Season 1 than being ""duped"" once again by the many positive reviews on Amazon.

Story - Like most other negative reviews of this show by other users, I also feel that this started on the right foot. The first couple of episodes was eerie and captivated my attention. While the overall plot and story line was not something you haven't seen or heard of before, I held hope that they could do something special and different here. Well, that hope died completely as I gravitate towards the later episodes. Rather than being a joy to watch, it actually became a chore and that's never good. The same thing happens over and over again but with different characters. It's a cheap way to drag the story on. Did I mention that things get a bit predictable? Oh yes it does! And that does not help the situation one bit. It's also infuriating how certain ""rules"" apply in certain episodes/characters but not in others.

Characters - Like what other reviewers have mentioned, the characters here are a bit dry and boring. There is hardly any character growth at all which makes each and every episode that much more dreading to watch. They all act and behave the same as the last time you saw them. To be fair, it is what it is. The characters can only act and recite the dialogue as dictated by the writers and creators of this show. While it was a bit dreadful, believe me when I say that there is much more worst things about this show than the dialogue or dry characters.

Horror - As the episodes start to increase, I then realized that this is yet another one of those shows that can only give you a ""scare"" by using cheap scare tactics that we've no doubt seen a hundred times in other ""horror flicks"". The story in itself doesn't give you chills. Because this is not a movie but a series, it gets so bad later on that you'll even know when these said ""scare"" moments will be. Rinse and repeat and there you have it. The ""scary"" part of this series.

Gore/Sex - Seems to me that there are a lot of sensitive people out there and are quick to hate on a show/movie just because some things offend them personally. It's perfectly fine if you think all the gore and sex scenes makes you uncomfortable but giving this show a low rating just because of that when they have only finished one or two episodes is very unfair. Personally, I'm okay with all this as this seems to be the theme of the show.

What are the good things about this show? The first is that its on Amazon Prime! Coming in second would be young Moira! Don't have much more to say than that. The show had potential but the creators messed up horribly (no pun intended) by creating this cluster ""you-know-what"" as the episodes went on. I am no very, very weary of season 2 and 3. Again, I have heard good things of Season 3 and although each new season brings a completely new story, I am staying far away for now.",1388188800,3,3070,4.36013986013986
4827398,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Dark, perverted, horrifying, sick and twisted this show is one I can not recommend enough. Get a drink and some friends or a date wait until it get dark turn out the lights and enjoy the horror show that is more man than monster and more brains than blood and leave the movies that can only rely on jump scares and gore to the armatures to make and the sissies to watch as this depraved psychological thrill ride play on.

The downside to it? What downside? I guess some of the spots or over the top creepy and that will turn some off but that is the point of the show.",1388102400,,569,4.126126126126126
4827399,5,B005LAJ1PE,Great Show for any one who enjoys paranormal/sci-fi. I enjoy how the show segregates seasons and brings back actors in different roles.,1388102400,,135,5.181818181818182

I am looking forward to season two but I know it is a whole new story line. I am excited to watch it.

Connie Britton quickly sheds her ""Friday night lights nice-Mom"" persona and gives a solid believable dramatic performance of Vivian. Dylan McDermott, usually relies on his on his bedroom eyes to stare us into believing he is a crediible actor but in playing this character you really believe he IS a father/husband struggling to save his family from the horrors of the ""death house"". Loved every second of it!!!",1387411200,,515,5.070588235294117

Often, when I tell people about this show, they think it is standard horror story fare with a single clear cut villain.  Watch more them once to be sure to get all of the subtleties these great writers have included.  The actors are really talented and deserve more credit than they are given.

It's not one of those shows that you have to watch from the very beginning of the season to understand what's going on. Every season is a different ""theme"".  The first season is about ghosts, the second season is about an asylum and the third is about witches.  Some of the characters are in the following season but play different roles.

4827481,1,B005LAJ1PE,"This show COULD be very good, but the gratuitous gore, violence and sexual content take away from the psychological aspect of horror.

4827491,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I like a good horror movie now and then although ghosts, zombies and such are not my favorite kind this series got me interested in the characters and wondering what would happen next.

The acting is good and the story is interesting. I haven't personally been a big fan of McDermott but in this series he is convincing.

The worst thing about the series season is the annoying habit of Amazon to get you interested in something like this and then start charging per episode to continue. This policy might actually get me to quit Amazon prime,",1386979200,,543,4.587628865979381
4827492,1,B005LAJ1PE,"I watched the first two episodes before I just couldn't make it anymore. It employes every tired horror movie technique, so when they tried be scary, all I could do was laugh. The characters are so paper-thin it hurts. The bullies could be swapped out for any Stephen King bully for how one-dimensional the were.

It's almost like the writers of this show have never met another person before. These characters don't interact like people, but more like robots, each equipped with a permenant grimace.

Not a single second of this show was I invested, because not a single second did the show make me care. It put nothing at stake.

""Oh no, she's pregnant? There's no way that it is that rubber man's, who was clearly not her husband (and any woman who has been with her man for more then two minutes knows how they are in bed and around it), baby is it? There's no way this is going to come back to a big dramatic (read: cornily over-blown) climax is it?""

I know, there are twists and turns and more ghosts show up and ghosts leave and people die, but none of that matters if the show keeps making it so obvious what is going to happen, makes it so obvious the little tricks it's using to try and get us to care. It's just every tired horror cliche in the book, and to anybody that has watched any of the classics can see when this show is blatantly ripping off of them. With every 'turn', you can clearly see what is going to happen.

I would much rather watch real accounts of paranormal activity then this garbage any day, because at least then my intelligence isn't being as opening insulted.",1386892800,3,1597,4.4

4827504,4,B005LAJ1PE,"The first half of this season was amazing - creepy and intense.  Yes, there's some gore, but I loved the psychological aspect of it.  About halfway through, though, it got sorta campy and over the top and that's when it lost me.  Still worth it to watch til the end and see how everything wraps up.",1386720000,,298,4.285714285714286
4827505,5,B005LAJ1PE,"American Horror Story has a lot going on. It is horrifying and at the same time a highly addictive show. The storyline is absurd but the writing is incredible. I wanted to hate the characters but the acting is so good. Many scenes are appalling, yet I could not look away.  It's quirky and far-fetched plot somehow becomes believable. The scripting is weak at points but is easily forgivable due to the amazing presentation. The series also nods to every genre--it's a campy meets true horror meets comedy meets sci-fi meets drama sort of show. Sure, there is a lot to dislike about AHS, but the writing and acting manages to pull it all together to create one of the most wonderfully uncomfortable shows on tv.",1386720000,,711,4.642857142857143

4827539,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I love the show, buffers quickly.

the 1st season is a real shocker and is addicting and pleasurable (thus the ""porn"" joke) some nudity of a butt and sexually suggestive themes, harsh language at times...",1385769600,,204,4.828571428571428

4827555,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Classic Film Horror, craftily packaged for TV.  Knockout performance by Jessica Lange.  A heartthrob from my youth.  Still gorgeous these years later.  The second season has few return actors, in entirely new roles.  But the first season was incredible.  And nicely tied up for the finale.  No spoilers here, but for horror fans, worth checking out on Amazon Prime Video for free.",1385510400,,380,5.032258064516129
4827556,1,B005LAJ1PE,"Awesome series....But only one star because I am VERY disappointed that only the first show of the season is free.  PRIME REQUIRES THAT YOU PAY A HEFTY CHARGE TO WATCH EACH ADDITIONAL EPISODE.  After the PRIME 30 day intro  I  currently have,  I would be nuts to  pay for a yearly service AND pay to watch the rest of the episodes.....DUHHHHH!!!! This has got to be the most expensive option currently available for movies and tv shows ever!
This a good deal for people that buy a lot of stuff from zon... the free zip ship saves them a lot.  Why not come up with a deal just for entertainment...sans the shipping perk..again...creepy, freaky, nightmare inducing, well written, call me crazy, I love this series and all it's characters, show since the beginning of time!",1385424000,,770,4.659259259259259

4827559,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Weird but strange - which is i'm sure it was meant to be. I was only left with two questions at the end. First : What truly was Thaddeaus's story (the child creature with the teeth & claws)? and Second : If most of the ghosts in the house were benevolent to begin with, why did they wait until the last family moved in before doing something about keeping from buying the house in the first place. Oh, and one more question - Why doesn't the realtor just take a loss on the property and leave the place abandoned?",1385251200,,513,4.191919191919192

4827564,1,B005LAJ1PE,"Ugly, awful story. Great cast, purchased because of Jessica Lang, and others in cast but oh my God, why such an awful, gross story content? Scary that this show is so popular because. Even my husband said why did you buy this it is ugly? It should come with a warning. Only watched 1/2 of first episode, could not watch more, Ugh. Hope I can return it!",1385164800,,352,4.268656716417911

Unfortunately this is the only season they currently have available on Amazon Instant Video (at least for free), but I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's on the fence.  I ended up watching almost the entire season over the span of 3 days.  It was very addicting!",1385078400,,436,4.4125

4827569,3,B005LAJ1PE,The story became a bit hokey at the end of season 1. It was an odd out of the way  storyline anyway but it kept my interest until it petered out at the end.,1385078400,,156,3.588235294117647

4827574,3,B005LAJ1PE,"The pilot intrigued me. I have never been one to enjoy horror stories, but this one got me going. I kept watching one episode after another. Then it got boring. Then it seemed just plain stupid. Jessica Lang is certainly the high spot, it is surely the best role of her career. She shines. It is too bad that they couldn't keep the momentum going. By episode seven I lost interest. I still tried to watch, but I just couldn't sit through any more....nonsense. Too bad. Ultimately, it became silly, as any silly, cheap, teeanage horror flick. Too bad.",1384905600,,550,4.565656565656566

It is an intelligent, creepy, and witty show that is a bit more of a psychological thriller than horror. Nonetheless, I think many will enjoy this show once given a chance. Hint - Watch from the beginning. I once tried getting into the show by watching an episode from the middle of the season and I was totally lost, lol. Watching in sequence will definitely help you to fully understand the story line and characters and their actions. Must see tv for me!",1384819200,,581,4.762376237623762

4827589,5,B005LAJ1PE,I didn't see that coming AT ALL.  A horror story that COMPLETELY took me by surprise!  The ending of each episode was a cliffhanger and the final episode just blew me away!  How could I NOT give it 5-Stars!,1384732800,,206,4.230769230769231

4827597,3,B005LAJ1PE,"This show was recommended to me by many people over the course of a couple years. I kind of avoided looking into it until recently when I was looking into seeing a new show. I have to say, I am certainly not shocked or bothered by sexuality, gore or violence on tv, but the first few episodes of this show bothered me a bit. I felt a lot of the stuff shown was more for shock value than actual storyline. But I stuck with it and I have to say that I started to really enjoy it. I do think that it is genuinely creepy and I enjoyed some of the character development with the ghosts. I will say, a lot of the negative reviews on this show are from people who are either against homosexuality or just simply claim that this show is filth. I think these reviews should be disregarded unless you're close minded. Aside from that, I will warn anyone that if cinematic depictions of the list below bother you, you should probably pass on this one:

Strong sexuality (sex, rape, bdsm elements, masturbation, mild nudity (both male and female)
Violence (school shooting, murder, extreme gore, mutilated bodies)
Strong language (use your imagination)
Depression and suicidal behavior (cutting, suicide)
Infanticide
Abortion

Otherwise, queue it and enjoy it. This show certainly isn't for the fainthearted, but if you are a fan of the twisted and creepy you'll certainly get a kick out of this show.",1384473600,,1389,4.619433198380567

4827602,3,B005LAJ1PE,"Good effort to pay homage to the many devices employed by horror films made in the last 40 years or so.  From the creepy fleeting passage of a danger unseen by the protagonist (but seen by the viewer) to just plain good old fashioned gore, the creators of this show do a nice job...at the beginning.  But this sort of stuff is best consumed start-to-finish in an hour and a half, not in a 12-episode series.

By the mid-point of the series, it ceases to be scary, maybe a little spooky, but your interest is still held by each episode's revelation of a new disturbing chapter in the house's history.  But it's starting to turn into a soap opera, as the mystery vanishes and the cast of characters in the house continues to grow.

By the last few episodes, there's no scare left in the program, and you've pretty much got the whole thing figured out if you've thought about it much.  It's become pretty much 100% soap opera drama by this time.  I don't know how you could keep a single theme scary for 12 hours, but kudos for trying, I guess.  A satisfying series, I suppose.  The sex was a bit overdone.  The prudish in the audience will probably want to know why it's relevant to the story.  Aside from one or two bits that play into the story, it's just gratuitous.",1384387200,,1267,4.371794871794871

Although I was on the cusp at first, the superb acting, interesting story lines and quirkiness of the series held my interest. I was extremely surprised at Jessica Lange's acting capabilities...who would have thought she had it in her to be so creepy and menacing. She was extremely good, as were the other actors. The series is a little confusing at first, but once you get into it, it all makes sense. in all, it was quite good with many highly unexpected twists. Quite a bit of violence and gore, but also sprinkled with amusing moments. Well worth watching, and totally different than anything else on television.",1384387200,,699,4.645161290322581

4827617,5,B005LAJ1PE,I started watching American Horror Story this current season and i honestly couldn't see what all the hype was about so i decided to watch it from the first season. WOW! I watched the entire season in just a few days and it was so scary and exciting i couldn't wait to see more.

4827619,5,B005LAJ1PE,Can't believe this show is not on a paid network like HBO or ShowTime. Very well done show with high production value.

There are some predictable points, and a few things that are confusing, but overall it's so good.  I couldn't stop watching.  I went through the full season in three days and if I had more time, it would have been in one day.  I'm definitely captured as a fan (and having started to watch season one after season 3 is already underway, I must comment that I absolutely loved the recasting of the actors into completely new roles with each season.  It adds to my interest and intrigue with the show).",1383609600,,638,4.495652173913044

4827654,5,B005LAJ1PE,The show was unique and had me guessing the whole way. I'm thinking that I know a plot line then it shifts and throws me for a loop. It was scary enough to to actually believe that ghosts walk among us.,1383436800,,202,3.951219512195122
4827655,3,B005LAJ1PE,"A little bit too juicy for my taste. Not much restraint. But very watchable. Cool opening sequence reminiscent  of the one in remake of ""the hills have eyes"", another movie suffering from excess juice. Not important, but the star of American Horror Story looks like ""the ass baby of david schwimmer and pierce brosnan."" --my brother. Ain't finished the first season. May like the show better or worse at that point.",1383436800,,415,4.845070422535211
4827656,4,B005LAJ1PE,"This show follows a struggling family who, trying for a fresh start, move into a new home only to find that it's haunted.
I love this show, despite the fact it would be just as good if SOME of the sex and gore were toned down. I'm far from a prude but a few of the scenes seemed so gratuitous that they detracted from the storyline a bit and were more than just shocking entertainment, but were actually very disturbing and unnecessary.
The GOOD: Excellent acting by all. The storyline has twists and turns at every corner. The characters all get their own back story which, when told, collectively add to the richness of the already intriguing center story.
I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. The show was so good and ALMOST everything gets wrapped up neatly, but not everything. I initially thought it was a cliffhanger, but found out this show makes each season into its own miniseries. So the end of season 1 is the end of that storyline. The next season picks up with a new story set somewhere else, nothing to do with the prior season.
Overall, I love this show and would recommend it to adults who like horror, drama, suspense, mystery or any combination of the above.",1383436800,,1182,4.476851851851852
4827657,3,B005LAJ1PE,It's an ok story.  To me the plot was a little too far fetched to be entertaining.  Some of the things which occur just  did not make sense.,1383436800,,140,3.9285714285714284

I was completely sidetracked when I couldn't put the characters together then I seen online that they have no Correlation so then I enjoyed it a lot more. Disappointed that they do not continue this season especially since they left it at climax cliffhanger but it is understandable that they want a different story every time. If you want to watch something really different, weird, strange and interesting thus is for you. Love the creepy theme song.",1383350400,,582,4.605769230769231

4827676,2,B005LAJ1PE,"The show started out very tempting, but I found myself raising an eyebrow as twists and new characters began to appear at an alarming rate.  At first, I expected this to be the sign of a brilliant show, and that all these twists would come together in an equally brilliant culmination.  However, it quickly became apparent that the writers had simply run out of ideas, and were beginning to guide the show more like a soap opera.

As another reviewer points out, the references to Columbine are tasteless.  Not to mention they are a prime example of the horrible writing; in one scene, the school killer describes asking a girl ""Do you believe in God?"" before he kills her...yet later, we actually get to SEE the killer kill that girl, and he never asks the question.

I watched this show hoping to find something to replace my Breaking Bad fix, and to bide my time between new episodes of The Walking Dead.  But after this first season, I am done.  On that note, the last couple episodes are HORRIBLE.  The story telling gets almost cartoonish, with awkward failed attempts at comedy, and a pretty clear ripoff of Beetlejuice (although I should have guessed, given the obvious attempt with the Winona Ryder-esque daughter).

If you enjoy mindless entertainment and don't care about plot holes galore, then this show might be for you.  If you actually have a life and enjoy something meaningful and intelligent when you do take the time to sit down and watch television, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",1383177600,4,1501,4.760617760617761

4827687,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Season 1, Murder House, was well done, especially for a television series, with a story that is very high on the ""creepy"" factor. The story lost its way a bit mid-season, but pulled together and wrapped-up nicely by the end. It lacks a strong how & why backstory that would have tied the whole season together even better, leaving me wondering why this house is the way it is. There is the suggestion that it became so because of the original owner (I'll withhold any spoilers), but it is not clear if that was the origin of the problems or merely the first instance.

My biggest complaint is the over sexualizing of much of the story, which is often quite graphic and frequently mixes sex and violence. I though the story could have appealed to a much larger and somewhat younger audience by softening the sex (including rape scenes, graphically portraying thrusting bodies, and murder during a sexual act). As it is, I would give it a strong R rating if it were a movie, and wouldn't allow a child younger than 16 or 17 to watch it. Overall, that aspect disappointed me as my younger teenagers would have enjoyed the story.",1383091200,,1125,4.569306930693069

4827692,4,B005LAJ1PE,"3/4 of the way through Season 1, the pilot remains the scariest episode of the show and, frankly, the best. The rest of the show is very good, but seems to pale somewhat in comparison to that phenomenal opening salvo that assaulted your senses, shocked you, and just maybe turned you on a little.

The aesthetic is unique and the story line is rich.  If you enjoy horror, mystery, or even a little dash of drama, this is for you.  Give it a shot.  Id suggest buying the whole episode immediately and just watching through, but if you want to test drive the vehicle first, just purchase the first episode and I bet you'll be curious for more.  Thats the thing about it, it makes you ""curious.""  Not many shows can do that anymore.",1382918400,,565,4.470588235294118

4827695,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I don't watch TV these days, but when I do I expect to blown away.  American Horror Story did just that.  I'd heard a couple of people talking about how much they enjoyed it.  I dragged my heels about checking it out for myself and marathoned the first season this weekend. I could kick myself for waiting so long. Eerie, erotic, and entertaining.  The cast of characters is eclectic enough to work on so many levels.  It's not perfect, but I appreciate it all the same.  It reminds me of another series - American Gothic, that was cancelled way before it's time, and ironically enough, Sara Paulson, who plays the reporter Lana in Season 2 also had a major role in American Gothic as Merlyn, the dead sister of Caleb who appears to him after she has been killed by Caleb's father. Jessica Lang would be a good match for Gary Cole's Lucas Buck charater - both enjoyably evil. I'm a few episodes into the second season and even though the storyline is different, I'm still enjoying it.  Glad I checked it out, just in time for Halloween.  Can't wait to watch Season three.",1382918400,,1071,4.484536082474227

I confess I have begun waiting to watch almost all series just so I don't have to wait weeks to see the next one but merely seconds for the downloads. This holds true for all of them. The subject is adult and the story well woven together and I enjoy as the characters begin to realize what is happening around them. Well done... well done. HBO was a pioneer and then everyone began to challenge them. Much of that was on private network and dealt with adult themes like... Adults! This regular network paring is equal too and better than much that came before and now.

4827711,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I really just ""stumbled"" upon this show this year (season 3).  So once bitten, of course I had to get caught up on season's one and two.  I don't really watch very much tv, (Game of Thrones is the only other show I follow) but this has become my absolute favorite.  Season one is very gory and the images are mentally shocking (?).  I'm sure that is the creator's intentions.  I haven't been able to get completely caught up watching season one because there is only so much shocking imagery I can watch and process before having to take a break.  All in all, from the 6 or 7 episodes I have finished watching, the show is superbly done.  I've always thought Jessica Lange was an excellent actress, but she absolutely shines in this show.

I didn't really read any synopsis on American Horror Story before watching, but I finally clued in that the central characters revolve around hauntings caused by famous brutal and gory murders throughout history in the area.  Season one is set in Los Angeles and touches upon several famous murders that happened in California (i.e. Black Dahlia, etc.).  (season 3 is in New Orleans....sorry, haven't watched season 2 yet)

I've read that television is in entering a new ""golden age"" (where else can tv go but up, after reality shows?).  If that is true, American Horror Story is one of the shows that is putting it there.  A+ acting, writing, and imagery that keeps you engaged with the story and on the edge of your seat.  Guess what I'll be watching on Halloween?  LOL",1382832000,,1511,4.585820895522388
4827712,2,B005LAJ1PE,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

American Horror works acceptably (until the end) because it keeps so many things in motion--- plots and timelines and things that go bump in the night. Sort of like Heroes (also a 2)-- and no scarier-- the show relentlessly churns and twists to surprising reveal after surprising reveal all delivered with maximum pathos, though a fair share of the performances are good. There is never once a scary moment--- quick cuts and lots of goofy canted shots pretty much guarantee there is never any atmosphere, unless you think music videos are atmospheric. The heavy handed music choices don't help, excepting the cool whistling bit and the piece that sounds stolen from Wojciech Kilar's superb score for (the otherwise crappy) Coppola-directed Dracula (I don't like to put Bram Stoker's name at the front of that one.)

So AHS functions as a fast moving and surprising soap opera with a big budget, some good make up fx and some decent acting, which is why it gets a 2. Actually had the last double length episode not been the series nadir--- really bad dialogue and spacious melodrama that fails utterly--- the show would be slightly north of mediocre, but 'afterbirth' is pretty stinky, and the penultimate episode 'birth' not much better.

Like most Stephen King stuff that I don't like*, it is essentially modern day fantasy with too much explanation of everything so it barely even functions as suspense, much less horror. Ghosts as lead characters who can appear and disappear at will puts this in a camp with things like Ghost (yes, the Swayze one) and Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. If you think Ghost and Blithe Spirit are horror, then American Horror Story is horror, but I don't (and you shouldn't) even if AHS has occasional gore and burn make up.

Overall, American Horror Story is a mildly engaging soap with better than average acting for a soap and a lot more blood than the average soap, but actually less creepy than the original Dark Shadows show, which actually had atmosphere and let the scenes breathe (and had better music as well).

*Horror guys I dig are the old school of Lovecraft, Blackwood and Machen, and also the visceral and immediate books of high tension storyteller Richard Laymon.",1382832000,3,2252,4.869451697127937

It is definitely not for the very young, those who are easily impressionable or those who are easily grossed out or offended.  There is a lot of violence and blood and some male nudity (from behind). Personally, I didn't find it very scary - I didn't spook once, but it is creepy and there are times when some might be startled enough to jump.  I watched because I was fascinated by the complexity of the relationships and the layers of deceit, love and cruelty.

4827764,5,B005LAJ1PE,"AMERICAN HORROR STORY
SEASON 1

When this show was first announced I very excited to see what it was all about. I liked the cast for it and eventually when the teasers were released I was all about it. I have always been a big horror fan and like most I am all about a good ghost story, especially a series. This is the first season of the show that would eventually be named ""Murder house"" for obvious reasons. I am happy to announce that this show was great as was the next season as is the current one now.

The first season is all about a family of three who move into an old house, a house with history and guests who don't want to leave. Father Ben, wife Vivien and daughter Violet are trying t start over in life after a series of setbacks. Setbacks such as Vivien giving birth to a stillborn baby as well as her husband cheating on her with one of his students, who may not be completely out of the picture. All seems well enough until they hear the stories of their new house, ""Murder House"" as the locals call it. Things start up from there as previous residents of the home seem to not be able to leave. The reason being that some where up to twenty people have died in the house.

This was an excellent show that kept me interested all the way to the very last episode. What made it even better was that I knew that I was going to get an ending since every season would be a different story. What better way to start out with than a haunted house tale. They way that the ghosts interact with the living in this show is great since they actually seem like real people who are still there. Now that is nothing new in this kind of story but the characters are very well written and acted as well.

Dylan McDermott [husband], Connie Britton [wife], and Taissa Farmiga [daughter] are excellent as the family that moves in. each has their own problems to deal with and portray here and as the lead cast members the majority of the show falls on them. Still everyone here throughout the entire season is great from the smallest role to all the supporting roles. The writing, direction, and the way the show was shot all match the performances on every level.

Now this show is not for everybody as some have called it a little risky, especially as far as the sexuality goes. I don't disagree with these people but none of it bothered me. For the most part I think it helped the story along, especially with McDermott's character. With this set you get an audio commentary along with many behind the scenes stuff. I do recommend this show to all horror or haunted house/ghost story fans. Season two is now out on DVD and Blu-Ray called ""Asylum"" and season three {Coven] is currently on TV.",1381968000,,2693,4.324752475247525

4827766,5,B005LAJ1PE,Just want to watch second season but have to pay :( love thrillers going for more. The idea of a haunted place and the dead looking so human was amazing,1381968000,,152,4.1

4827768,5,B005LAJ1PE,Loved loved loved this season. I started watching American Horror story second season and finally went back and watched the first season. It's better than the 2nd season.,1381968000,,170,5.107142857142857

4827770,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I was sick for a few days and needed something to entertain myself. I stumbled upon this show on Netflix and I'm glad I did! I watched the whole season in one day! It's about this family who moves to the west coast from the east coast. They find this house that's priced way below its value and once they move in they find out why. It's called the ""murder house"" by the locals and is even on a haunted tour. The episodes start off in the past with the previous owners who have lived and died in the house then goes back to present day to the new owners. It really keeps you on your toes throughout the whole season. It's a must watch! I highly recommend it!",1381881600,,657,4.10077519379845
4827771,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I'm still wondering why it took me so long to watch this show! I'm watching episode 8 right now and I'm really obsessed with it. AHS is one of those shows that you get addicted with since the very first episode. The way the stories are told is so unique, and when you think you know something, everything changes with crazy twists (something I love about TV shows that always leave you clueless about what's going to happen next), and the acting is great too, the whole cast is terrific! My favorite character is Violet. The special effects, the scary scenes and the drama make this show one of the best horror shows of the last few years; it has a little bit of something, it's just not horror and blood, you get to see a psychological side of the characters before the craziness shows up.

Anyway, if you're looking for an awesome show, you have to watch this! You won't regret it. Can't wait to catch up with seasons 2 & 3.",1381881600,,926,4.3526011560693645
4827772,5,B005LAJ1PE,very scary engaging made me want to see the first 2 seasons on fx and there was some many little plots going on,1381881600,,111,3.869565217391304
4827773,5,B005LAJ1PE,Kept me riveted and wanting more after every show ended.  Never got sappy but stayed true.  Quite a good chiller.,1381881600,,113,4.6

4827778,4,B005LAJ1PE,"If your a fan of horror, you'll love this fresh approach to the Haunted House genre. The writting and cast is superb! Jessica Lange has come a long way from King Kong, her protrayal of Constance Langdon is a joy to watch, she transforms from sickly, sweet grandma type to a dangerous, manipulating she-bitch in a blink of an eye. Dylan McDermott captures the essence of a confused and troubled soul and the bitter, sneeringly distrustful daughter played by Taissa Farmiga is fantastic. She's ghost-like from the beginning, a small doll face floating inside a hood of shoulder length, dirty blond hair
 My only disappointment with the cast is the Mother, Vivien played by Connie Britton. She just doesn't seem to hold up her end in comparrison to the others and some of her close ups reveal a much older woman than protrayed.
 I've watched both seasons so far and am beginning the third with great anticipation, you won't be disappointed and will probably become a dedicated fan",1381795200,,977,4.809523809523809
4827779,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I liked the series a lot, the actors, the plot and the spooky things. Only reason I didn't give it a five star is because of the way they had the ghosts interact, or not, with each other. For example, whenever the good ones were out you would very seldom see the bad ones as well when something big happened. There was really no major comfrontation between them, that was my mayor observation.",1381795200,,393,4.397260273972603

4827783,5,B005LAJ1PE,"If you missed this when it originally aired, shame on you!!  However, I can't say too much because I did.  Start from the beginning to get the full effect of this marvelous series.  Each episode holds a new plot twist and once you get to the last few episodes, you will not want to stop watching.  Brilliantly filmed.  Excellently casted.  Only complaint was that I missed it the first time around on FX.",1381795200,,404,4.465753424657534

4827786,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I started watching to show with my son, it was not anything like I thought it would.  I was expecting just blood and gore, which is not my style.  It had a great story line to it.  Had to then watch the season 2, which I didn't realize would be totally different.  Loved it too.  Excited for the third season.",1381708800,,309,4.083333333333333

4827788,4,B005LAJ1PE,I cannot wait to see seasons 2 & 3  even though the story line is not related Murder house was unique and I enjoyed getting freaked out by what happened to the characters in this series.

There are a lot of twists and mysteries, so if you decide to watch, give it a chance and don't stop after the first episode.  You'll get the hang of the plot after the third episode, then it's hard to quit.

I do want to say I was not a fan of Season 2, Asylum, & quit watching it as it was just too depressing for me. I could not relate to the characters & there were too many sad things going on.

4827878,2,B005LAJ1PE,"It seems that the majority or people who dislike this show are prudish, religious folks who are easily offended.
I wanted to add a review since I am not one of those people. I like a wide variety of films and find sex and violence are often aspects of some of my favorites.

The concept of a show that touches on many classic horror themes is so ripe with possibilities. Unfortunately the show lacks focus. The term ""Hot Mess"" keeps coming to mind. Rather than slowly building a compelling story (a TV series is the perfect medium for this) , they go for a kind of fast-food delivery. There are secrets that do take the whole season to unfold, but the show tries to incorporate too many elements and characters for it's own good. By the end of the season I felt that I did not care what happened to the characters, I was just sticking around for the big reveals.",1379548800,28,862,4.354037267080745

4827882,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Ok, after watching the first episode, my roommate and I almost gave up on this series (Like most people it seems after reading the comments).  Too much sex and nothing makes sense.  I guess they were trying to make it the hook episode but it didn't really do that for us.  We just ended up hating most of the characters. After the first episodes, the sex scenes die down and the story and characters come out.  The props are a bit overused (babies in jars, creepy house, ect.) but the story always keeps turning so you have to be on your toes to figure out whats going on.  This show also has a lot of back stories so if you are into that, you will definitely like this show.  Characters that you hate, you are probably eventually going to like or feel sorry for.

So many of my friends love this series, and while I did like it, I thought there were a lot of plot holes, introduced ideas that were never developed, and had jumped around too much.  If you watch it only once a week (as designed), you might not be bothered by that, but when you watch them all in a short amount of time... you an see a lot of the inconsistencies and such.

This series is definitely a side step from most thrillers.  There's a great deal of sexual context, which depending on your comfort level can definitely make some uncomfortable.  The constant addition of characters and their subsequent development made this series hard to stop watching.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a different flavor of thriller.

There were some stronger performances by Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Evan Peters, Lilly Rabe, Taissa Farmiga, and Zachary Quinto. I have to admit that I was a tad biased going into watching this as I had watched the 2nd season of American Horror Story first when it aired on TV (and I'm a Nashville fan, which Connie Britton is fantastic in). Generally, the story lines all crossed and fell together in interesting ways. My only weak point, which is actually kind of big, was Dylan McDermott's character. I don't know if the fact that he had an affair in the first place, or if the writing just never redeemed him enough to be likable, but about half-way through I just didn't care if he stuck around or not.

Zachary Quinto is in a smaller role in this season than the second one, but he still shines just as much. So excited to see who all comes back for season 3.",1378166400,,955,4.395480225988701

I didn't think I would like it, but I was hooked after the first 15 minutes. Every episode is a surprise and provides backstory into the ""Murder House"" and into the characters. Oh, and the acting is SUPERB. I haven't seen TV acting on a level such as this, except maybe in AMC TV shows like The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad. This show is just so unique and unexpected.

I was there, and I was interested, but it didn't last.  The storyline was interesting at the begining.  I kept watching each successive episode but then I kept seeing the same acts again and again that it began to interfere with the attentiveness to the story.  To keep it short, I got bored to the point that I no longer cared.  I seriously doubt if I will go back to looking at the show.  If you can stick it out, go for it.",1377820800,,436,4.130952380952381

4827925,5,B005LAJ1PE,If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I love the perspective of the ghosts and the back stories to each one of them.  The struggles that the dead and the living have were wonderfully played out.  The creepy factor was awesome!,1377734400,,228,4.255813953488372

4827948,5,B005LAJ1PE,"One of my favorite subjects in the world has got to be haunted houses. I don't mind the blood and gore that comes with a good haunted house story and I don't mind if there is no blood or gore just psychological scariness. Luckily for me this series is jam packed full of both. There are so many twisty turny surprises and when you think you have something figured out you are usually proven wrong. There is blood and gore and horrifying things in almost every episode. This is definitely not a series to watch with your kiddoes but I am thoroughly thrilled that the creator's did not hold back - they show the stabbings, shootings, blood spatter, body parts and best of all Dylan McDermott's naked hiney.

I am fascinated by this series and watched it all myself and am now making my husband watch it with me. I watched the first season on Amazon Prime but will probably pay the $20 for the second season when we are done with this one. I would recommend this for the drama lovers that don't have weak stomachs, for the scary movie buffs and especially for the haunted house fans - no kids though!",1377129600,3,1097,4.403940886699507

I have to say, that I have never been so intrigued by a show like this for a while. I watched season 1 in about a weekend and started season 2 shortly after. The series in short just gives me chills! The acting is very convincing and you become extremely invested in the characters that they become short of a family member of yours. Watch it and you will see what I mean. This will not disappoint!",1377129600,,522,4.23
4827950,5,B005LAJ1PE,I am still having trouble sleeping after finishing this show a week ago. So scary and twisted. But it's also smart and the acting is superb. The storyline is just keeps you hooked and wanting more. It's worth the sleepless nights.,1377043200,,230,4.634146341463414

If you like truly horrible things with ghosts and the terrors that mankind can inflict, this is a super show. It's a little addicting and mysterious. The acting and story line are superb. I highly recommend if you like the shivers that go up your spine when something horrible happens right in front of you. This show is truly creepy.",1376870400,,420,4.526315789473684

can be packed into one hour--way to many. However, the acting was superb, especially Jessica Lange, Conney Britton. There are many more who are deserving but my memory fails me.  I know darkness adds the aura of mystery, but the whole movie is a bit much it is so dark most of the time you can't even see it.",1376784000,,439,4.289156626506024

I loved watching Jessica Lange and (most times) Evan Peters too. That said, most all of the other characters weren't interesting, or believable. The first episode was promising, but it just went downhill from there. By the finale, I felt like I was playing Monopoly with a five-year-old who was just making it up as s/he went along. This season had potential, but there were a lot of easy fixes and not enough depth. I kept watching for the set and costume designs.

I was told that the next season is a completely different story. That's probably their best option as this season's story was stretched way too far for having so little substance.",1375920000,,794,4.5524475524475525

4828008,3,B005LAJ1PE,"We are late comers to this show.
In fact we had never even heard about it until July 2013  (when the 3rd Season was soon ready to start).

Of course that happens often these days.
With so many channels and shows these days, it seems a show can be popular and be on for years yet you never hear about it while you are off watching other stuff.

It's kind of like we all live in alternate ""entertainment"" universes.

But anyway ...

In a quirky, (sometimes perhaps too perverse) way .. the show grabs your attention.
It is a bit ""over the top"" but that is a trademark of the producers.

The concept is an original one.
So it does entertain.

Is it scary ........ hmmm,  not really.
I guess it is best summed up as a ""Hard R-rated Steven King""
More of a dark, dark comedy in a way.

The series seems to borrow very heavily from the movie THE OTHERS in this first season.

The story in this first season should have probably only been 8 episodes long.
It does feel like it is ""churning"" mid-season as a way to fill out 12 episodes.

All in all the acting is good, the concept is original.
It is well done.

Did we enjoy watching it? YES
Will we ever sit and watch the whole season again ?  PROBABLY NOT
Will we want to add this to our DVD collection like we have other recent TV shows like DEXTER, 24 ...  NO

I am glad we discovered it and watched it.
There was some good talent and effort spent to make this TV project ... but not something we will want to add to our collection or watch time and time again in the future.

I should mention ... the last episode was very weak in comparison to the rest of the season.
In fact, the last episode feels like it was an afterthought that was just tacked on at the end of the season.
Campy, goofy and not necessary.
You could actually skip the last episode and the season would be a better package.",1374278400,2,1839,4.138028169014085

I am VERY glad that I decided to give it a second chance. You can probably count on one hand the number of times in your life when a tv series actually SHOCKS you. This is definitely one of them. What a brilliant idea it was to have each season a completely different story line. It actually turned it into more of a mini-series. The ending blew me away, I NEVER saw it coming. There were so many different shockers it happened all most EVERY EPISODE. I have never seen anything like this. So, if you are smart you are smart you will not let this one pass you by.

But I've really gotta ask what they were smoking. This show is just a conglomeration of stale horror tropes strung together on a hope and a prayer. If it weren't for the great performance of Jessica Lange there'd be no point watching it at all.
By the end of the series I was just watching to see how bad it could get... how much more ridiculous crap they could shovel on. I wasn't disappointed, there was a load of it.

I'm guessing, based on what I've been told that season 2 is more of the same but with a different tale and cast of characters. I just might watch it when I'm feeling like a good laugh. Otherwise, this is pure MST3K stuff... except for Ms. Lange of course.",1372809600,2,752,4.295774647887324

4828053,5,B005LAJ1PE,"AMERICAN HORROR STORY is one of those series that is best enjoyed by getting the box set and viewing multiple episodes at once.  It's the perfect way to keep track of the series's many, many, twists and turns, along with some jaw dripping revelations over the course of the first season.  And let the viewer be warned yet again: there is graphic sexual content and violence, the kind that pushes the limit about as far as it can go for cable television.

But for those who like this kind of stuff, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is must see TV.  The basic premise is one of those horror story tropes: family goes through emotional trauma (psychology professor husband is caught cheating with a student)and moves across the country to LA and a fresh start, which includes buying an old house with a past in a quiet neighborhood. This Murder House, as it is called, has more than a few things in common with the Overlook Hotel from THE SHINNING, in that it is a place where a lot of bad things have happened to a lot of people, mostly former owners and some unlucky visitors.  Basically, what dies in the Murder House, stays in the Murder House and within these walls, the ghosts are all too real. These ghosts want things of those who are still alive and will do whatever it takes to get them. Not all of this is explained up front in the first episodes and part of the fun is figuring out who is dead and who is still among the living (at least for the moment).

One of the many things viewers might find off putting initially is that the story's principle characters, played by Dylan McDermott, Connie Britton, and Tessa Farmiga, are so down right unlikable and unsympathetic right from the get go.  McDermott's psychiatrist is an adulterer who is remorseful only because he got caught red handed, while Britton's wife is cold, bitter, and unforgiving-the complete opposite of the wife and mother she played on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  Teenage daughter Farmiga is sullen, full of resentment and hopelessly self absorbed.  Not the kind of people with whom you'd want to spend time, but without giving away any spoilers, it is safe to say that where these characters start out is not where they end up.  In the end, everyone is where they need to be, for good or bad.

Over the course of the season one, the plot comes to include such elements as the birth of the Anti-Christ, a Columbine like massacre, miss treatment of the mentally challenged, illegal abortions, kinky sex, rape, multiple murders, and a character in a Gimp suite. All that and the enduring legacy of family dysfunction, seeping into the woodwork generation after generation like so much toxic waste. A lot of viewers will be turned off or rubbed the wrong way, and not with out good reason.  But for those who are game, it'll be well worth the watch.

Maybe AMERICAN HORROR STORY's chief virtue is the excellent cast and superior acting which goes a long way toward helping sell the often outrageous actions of the characters.  And the most outrageous of them all is Jessica Lange as neighbor Constance Langdon, a faded southern belle who once lived in the Murder House herself and has left more than memories behind her there. Constance is the kind of part Bette Davis would have played back in her Baby Jane days, a human monster who makes even the dead cringe.  Lange is given great support by Frances Conroy as Moira, the maid who has been on the job a very long time; Evan Peters as a most troubled teen, a patient of McDermott's and secret boyfriend to Farmiga; and Denis O'Hare, as Constance's horribly disfigured ex lover who keeps hanging around for a reason.

There are also appearances by such familiar faces as Charles S. Dutton, Zachary Quinto, Lilly Rabe, Matt Ross, Kate Mara, Mena Suvari, Eric Stonestreet, Morris Chestnut, Christine Estabrook, David Anthony Higgins, and Brando Eaton.

Give credit to writers and creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, in AMERICAN HORROR STORY they have come up with something about as far from the saccharine sweetness of GLEE as it was possible to get. God help them if these two worlds would ever collide.",1371772800,2,4115,4.669432918395574

4828099,1,B005LAJ1PE,"The first episode was compelling, and I found myself wanting to watch another episode after each one ended as the story became more and more multi-layered. The problem was that this turned into a Columbine revenge wish-fulfillment fantasy very quickly, and I am glad that, from reading the reviews, I am not the only one who noticed this and found it inappropriate on several levels.  As it nears the end of the season, it changes from being fascinating and labyrinthine to being outright ludicrous, with the final episode becoming downright wacky and embarrassing and feels like a strangely compelling horror drama has suddenly and inexplicably become a rather bizarre and absurd comedy. My apologies to whoever is reviewing the reviews, but I don't want to give details for fear of spoiling, not that there is much to spoil.

Funny thing was that it was the weirdness of the story that kept me watching at first and kept me clicking on the next one and the next one, and not the main characters who I found remarkably unappealing (especially the father, Ben, who struck me as a sub-par psychiatrist with an attitude towards his patients that seemed more fitting of a disinterested minimum wage fast-food worker and not someone who is trying to gain the trust of suffering people--he seems to hold them in active contempt, the reason for which becomes apparent at the end, where you get the ""moral"" of the story, and I find it amazing that I am expected to like this character and regard him as a hero).  I got a kick out of the daughter, Violet, but mostly because of the actress's hilariously snarky way of delivering lines and not so much out of the character herself.

I'm not too interested in reading about or watching anyone's Mary Sue wish-fulfillment fantasy to begin with, but revenge fantasies are even worse. We all have our wish-fulfillment fantasies, but it's bad form to write them out and inflict them on the world at large.  I gave it two stars instead of one only because the initial handful of episodes were interesting enough to keep me watching, but since it went downhill into a personal revenge fantasy very quickly, I can't honestly give it anything better.  If you don't mind revenge fantasies, you'll love this because it is genuinely weird and labyrinthine in terms of general plot.  I might watch season 2 since it seems to involve an entirely new situation and characters, and I really hope it will be as fascinating as this series, but without the puerile revenge fantasy to ruin it.

EDIT:  I have changed the stars from 2 to 1, based on this excellent review by another Amazon reviewer: http://www.amazon.com/review/R877GIEVOOTLJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAJ1O0&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=.  I have to admit that this person has zeroed in on some of the things that have been grating me without me being able to put my finger on them, and a lot of the seemingly compelling and labyrinthine elements of the series are simply a trick of the way they decided to present a mashup of some remarkably unoriginal ideas as an original series.",1369094400,2,3072,4.890384615384615

4828118,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I'd highly recommend checking this out. This series, so far, (I'm only a few episodes in) is engaging and creepy on many levels, and for someone who's seen tons of the horror/drama genre, that's saying something. In short, it's takes a lot to get under my jaded, psychological skin and be pleasantly surprised by avoiding the usual clichs, including its clever blends of drama, suspense, mystery, romance, etc. It's also slickly edited without the camera work being intrusive or overly visually composed; moreover, as anyone in the industry would tell you, great film always starts with the script, including the right balance of the familiar with the unfamiliar, and again, this series, so far, has a solid foundation in this department. Topping it off is great casting, a nice blend again of the familiar and unfamiliar with characters we can actually believe in and care about. It's all about character ultimately, no? Hand in hand are the crew if stellar actors, all of whom, like Jessica Lange--certainly a standout, get the job done convincingly and with panache. It's nice when the acting is so polished, one forgets it's happening. Lastly, for someone with my schedule, it's impossible to find even a free hour most days to escape the real world for a few, so the short episodes please. What a pleasure to sit back in my lazy boy about midnight with my Kindle, some popcorn and whatever, and spin off the day's real world dramas with a nice dose of high quality, populist and happily, relatively mindless art. What remains to be seen is can this series sustain its promising start or will it go the way of say, the Walking Dead, becoming painfully watchable after a dozen or so episodes because the plot's all over the place and nowhere simultaneously, and one starts getting annoyed by the characters' acting tics? I hope not. So much can go wrong when one has to keep so many balls in the air, but again, so far, this series has been a surprisingly and pleasantly creepy rabbit hole. PS. A minor annoyance with almost all these current genre pieces are the tedious rip off opening credit sequences straight out of the cutting edge genre prototypes; I think the original was probably Fincher's ""Seven"", but these latest raw montage openings complete with ragged, frenetic soundtrack, have definitely lost their luster, seem forced and fake, almost comical, and thereby create the exact opposite effect they intend. Amazing by contrast, how, for example, Hitchcock's opening to Psycho, with Bernard Hermann's staccato violins still do the job all these years later, then again, genius is genius.",1368230400,,2603,4.931662870159453

The series match the quality that was put into the blu ray production.

It's scary without going for any cheap thrills. The acting is good. The photography is top-notch (though sometimes I did not understand why some scenes were shot, slanted, without any relation to the scene).

Sex ? Well, there are no nude scenes (there are more nude scenes in one episode of Girls than in this entire season). And the sex scenes (only a few) are not tawdry. Hey, this is an adult movie.

There are some inconsistencies though. Probably, because they have bought in several directors. But, that is indeed, the good part. Because, you do not feel like watching redundant episodes. Each episode has its character.

No unnecessary product placements (a short mention of Nescaf, though).  No ridiculous heavy-drinking or chain smoking scenes like in Mad Men.  There are some scenes where one of the gay couple is seen drinking white wine.

Ugh. I don't know from where they picked up that.

4828149,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Right up there with Six Feet Under, this has got to be one of the best dark television shows ever created.  Growing up watching Tales of the Crypt has really turned me toward darker themed tv.  This fits right in and it's really well thought out.  A lot of shows in this genre go straight for the scare instead of building up a story line.  The story here is strong and excellently acted.  The basis of the show is a terrific house in LA.  For some odd reason no one ever wants to buy it, so this family from out of town moves in without knowing that everyone who lives there eventually dies in the house.  And the story unfolds.. I love that the show criss crosses in time periods and sometimes they overlap REALLY seamlessly.

Some of the best acting in the show of course if from Jessica Lange, as the nosy/slightly wicked neighbor.  I love how the show really became unpredictable and there were a few moments where I was positive I knew what was going to happen, but NO, wrong.  I almost stopped watching because the first episode didn't catch my interest, I thought it would be the same stuff that's on TV every night, clearly I was wrong.

I've been a fan of American Horror Story since Frances Conroy and Mena Suvari convinced me to check out the Black Dahlia interpretation. As You probably know, the Black Dahlia murder is the most gruesome unsolved crime in the history of the USA.

I could tell before the opening credits started that this was something I was interested in. As creator Ryan Murphy says, this seasons focus was about infidelity. It did have a great dark suburban tone like Twin Peaks despite it taking place in Los Angeles.

I found all the cast to be great, Taissa Farmiga will be great to watch out for. She excelled as the brutally conflicted teenager Violet Harmon, whose mother, Connie Britton as Vivian Harmon is living the American Dream become nightmare whose husband Ben played by Dylan McDermott as a psychiatrist with plenty of his own issues.

Other new talents I enjoyed were Lily Rabe as Nora Montgomery; a socialite married to a prominent doctor with some huge demons and Evan Peters as Tate Langdon, the son of Constance Langdon played perfectly by Jessica Lange. A southern belle that believes in old fashioned manners and her own form of justice which makes her the most terrifying neighbor since the Young family in Desperate Housewives.

The mini-series is a very well-written, refreshingly original take to the 'haunted house'. Once you finish the first 10 episodes and you understand everything, it's a real mind warp that is disturbingly profound and profoundly disturbing.

TV-MA LSV

My rating: 16+

American Horror Story is essentially as violent as a horror movie would be. In this season the violence is pretty graphic and can be disturbing to younger or more sensitive viewers. There are many 'scary moments', frequent mild profanities, a scene of drug use and many scenes that would disturb people. Episode 6 is I think by far the most graphic and disturbing episode, but I think a 16 year old can handle it.

Suggested rating; 16+ for strong violence and gore, disturbing images, language and sexual content including brief nudity.",1364342400,,2259,5.032171581769437
4828218,5,B005LAJ1PE,It starts in a sort of confusing way. Didn't know quite what I was getting into. The characters are complex. Each episode is shocking and unanticipated. The acting is wonderful.  I'm looking forward to the next season.,1364256000,,218,4.891891891891892

I should have known with the Horror in title however I have watched and enjoyed some horror shows,  just not this.",1364256000,,367,4.246376811594203
4828220,5,B005LAJ1PE,I was thinking a horror series would be pretty lame. I must say that they did a great job with this one!! Even the opening credits are un-nerving!!!,1364256000,,148,4.321428571428571

4828224,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Good breakout hit with B actors and interesting plot, albeit somewhat predictable sometimes... the season closer was a let-down, but season is where it's at as far as cable network writing and cutting-edge production work goes. Very easy to tell when a different DP was used per some episodes as camerawork from left-field will appear in later episodes never to be seen in another episode again.
FX has such high quality stuff coming out nowadays, especially Archer and The League.",1364083200,,481,5.025
4828225,4,B005LAJ1PE,"American Horror Story is not what I expect in a ""horror story."" I expect to be somewhat scared by a horror show and I wasn't even slightly tense while watching this series. The lack of scare is why I gave it 4 stars.

The series plot, a house haunted by those who died in it and their manipulation of its residents, is depicted in a way that leaves you wanting to see more. I found the interaction between the residents and ghosts interesting. The ghosts can make themselves visible to the houses residents if they so desire. Their visibility leaves the residents thinking that the ghosts are humans; not the apparitions of troubled souls.

I enjoyed watching season 1 through Amazon's instant video app and I look forward to watching season 2.",1364083200,,744,4.628787878787879

I am so glad that I ordered this DVD collection of the whole season! BUT, I have to say that the quality of the DVD's were a little disappointing. It was crisp and sharp but the DVD'd would skip and freeze at some points and it was very upsetting. The second time I watched the DVD's they froze up so badly that I could not even continue to watch them and these were supposed to be brand new!! Not sure what the problem is but I was not happy!",1363737600,,553,4.036363636363636

4828242,5,B005LAJ1PE,"A lot of people (not that many actually) complain that this show either has no plot or that it is convoluted. Well, I guess that would be there opinion were it not for the fact that is simply false, opinions aside. A simple search online would explain to you the plot. May be they were impatient and didn't want to wait, after all the audience is not supposed to understand everything in the first few episodes. Then there are people who say that this show just rips off other sources of horror. My only response would be for them to speak to the people that say the plot is too complicated. Overall, I would say this show is pretty dang good and I recommend it. Also, obviously it's TV MA, so there's going to be some of ""that"" stuff in it. Sex and violence galore. Also, you'll see this in the first episode, a character cuts themselves frequently, so beware if you're sensitive to that topic.",1363651200,,895,4.397590361445783

4828244,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Better than any scary movies I've seen.  This show is definitely better viewed on DVD back-to-back than on television, as I think the commercials and week between episodes makes it less terrifying.  Plus, the story line is so complex with each character being intertwined, so watching all the episodes in a period of a week or two will definitely increase your understanding and appreciation for the awesome writing on this show.",1363478400,,429,5.028169014084507

4828289,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This was one of those happy accidents.  I was searching online for another TV show when this one came up.  Once I realized some of my favorite actors would be involved, I thought it would be worth the watch, especially since I could view it on Amazon Prime (cost-free).

This is not for the faint of heart, or the easily spooked.

But if you like psychological intrigue, blended with the supernatural, you are in for a treat.  Brilliant acting, edgy story-lines, sensuality, horror, and all the foibles of human nature (and not so human nature).

One extra-cool thing is that the season is self-contained, so you can watch Season 1 as a complete story-line without needing to watch Season 2.  No cliff-hanger nonsense, just a great season, start-to-finish, with surprises in each episode that make you want to re-watch previous episodes for subtle clues.

4828307,5,B005LAJ1PE,"its a great show. It follows a family's move from Boston to LA in order to start fresh. But the series really starts in the middle of the story and lets the viewer piece it together for themselves; like all good mystery-dramas should. As I said, it's not for children; there are sprinklings of adultery, S&M, violent murder, and even a little something for you true-crime buffs.",1362009600,,378,4.656716417910448

4828309,3,B005LAJ1PE,"Just as the title says, the first season of American Horror Story started so strong, and stayed that way for more than half the season, but it really just sputtered to the end. To be honest, I do not even think the final episode was necessary. It just kind of started to drag and limp after eight or so episodes and by the end you may find yourself just wondering why hasn't it ended already!  Because it stays strong for nearly 3/4 of the season, 3 out of 5 stars.  Ultimately, a rather disappointing finish.",1361923200,,509,4.347368421052631

4828316,5,B005LAJ1PE,"First of all, kudos to Amazon....I watched the first season episodes of ""American Horror Story"" on my recently purchased Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet. Video quality was very good. As far as this TV show, it's one of those programs that I would categorize as ""creepy"" yet ""fascinating"" to watch. I think only horror fans will be able to stomach this show. Some scenes/visuals in this show can sometimes make you feel slightly ""queasy,"" but I like it all the same. I think anyone who's watched this show would agree that the characters in this series are all definitely ""STRANGE."" Jessica Lange's character on the show is my favorite.

It does have a good story line within the ""horrors"". The ending got a little redundant but overall it is a good watch.

4828349,4,B005LAJ1PE,"American Horror Story is one of the hottest shows on television, but it's origins may surprise you. This innovate, unique drama, has similarities to several different shows, but most closely resembles Tales From The Crypt. Unlike Tales, the American horror stories each last one season instead of one episode. From season to season the story changes as does much of the cast, but one thing remains constant, it has some of the smartest and most daring people behind it. You may know the creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, as the guys who brought you Glee, but American Horror Story couldn't be more different. In this series they show a dark twisted side that they could never get away with on network television. As I said the story changes from season to season, so I can't really do a review of the series, but I can tell you about season one. The first season of American Horror Story introduces us to Los Angeles's famous murder house, which since it's creation, ninety years ago, has known nothing but death and heartache. The house is purchased by Dr. Ben Harmon, who knows nothing of the houses history. Dr. Harmon is moving his family across the country to give them a second chance after mistakes and personal tragedies. The story is gripping and easy to follow, but what I liked more were the flashbacks that told the history of the house and explain all the weird stuff that's happening. While the cast features some very experienced, award winning actors, it's a combination of Jessica Lange and Evan Peters who makes this show what it is. Lange is a veteran actress known more for her roles on the big screen, while Peters only just made an impression on me a couple of years ago in the film Clipping Adam. Their unique yet different styles and personalities are the reason this weird show works. In the same way they are able to connect with every character in the show, they are also able to connect with every member of the audience, and that's why they are two of the three cast members who are back for the new story, Asylum. American Horror Story is not like any other show you've seen on television, in fact, I'm pretty surprised they are able to get away with some of the stuff they are doing. It's hard to find a good TV show based on the Horror genre and when you do it's usually a lame comedy. Shows like the Munsters and the Addams Family are legendary, while shows like Harsh Realm and Freaky Links just fizzled out. American Horror Story is different though, as it's innovative and pushes the limits of what you can do on television. It's a show that is most definitely not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the unusual and tired of things like Twilight and The Walking Dead, that go absolutely nowhere, check out American Horror Story, you should be pleasantly surprised.",1361491200,,2807,4.5936254980079685

4828381,5,B005LAJ1PE,The DVD set  arrived on time and made a great Christmas gift.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes this,1361059200,,106,4.25
4828382,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I'm really torn by this series.  On the one hand, it's very original, quirky, creepy, odd, and compelling.  The acting is AMAZING, the characters are unforgettable, and the story is completely fresh.  On the other hand, it's incredibly and gratuitously perverted, insanely violent, and it is very clearly a vehicle for social conditioning (some of you will know EXACTLY what I'm talking about).  I suspect the target audience is older teens and twenty-somethings, but I'm sure there's a very substantial adolescent audience, too, and that makes me sick...but I still had to give it four stars.

This is NOT for the faint of heart.  Don't say nobody warned you.",1360972800,,660,5.009174311926605
4828383,1,B005LAJ1PE,"This Series started out really cool. If your a thesbian, progressive liberal like my sister who recomended this to me then you will probably like it passed the first few episodes. There is just too much BS in the series and though I'm not a homophobe there just seems to be too many gay love scenes on TV these days and this series is no exception. Sorry if this point of veiw may offend some of those reading this review but hey I'm entitled to my opinion too. Get over it.",1360972800,3,474,4.21978021978022

Me and my husband caught it after it aired and watched it. The best thing is you don't have to see the first season to watch the second season, and did I mention it is free on Amazon prime!!!",1360972800,,319,3.923076923076923

4828392,5,B005LAJ1PE,"American Horror story has terrific writing, directing, acting, suspense and thriller/ horror elements. This isn't your typical slasher type series or movie for that matter. There is substance to the show, I usually take an eternity to watch a series, but I flew through American Horror Story in under a week, it was almost an addiction, I felt compelled to see what was next in the Harmon family saga. This is TV worth watching, if you want something outside of the norm, is deep enough for challenging your mind or if you simply want to turn off your brain and be shocked, this American Horror Story fulfills both! Yes America, its that good.",1360713600,,643,4.699115044247788

4828395,5,B005LAJ1PE,"My friend originally got me hooked on this show and it became an instant favorite. It is one of the most dark, suspenseful, and interesting shows I have ever seen. Every episode starts off with a flashback to a murder in the house and then fast forwards to present time. The story telling is unbelievable, and every episode you get a little more background into the big picture. It is definitely the type of show that if you miss one episode you will be lost and also a show where you will sit down and watch five episodes in a row because you'll be hooked. The ending is awesome and a big surprise! It is a shame that second season didn't even come close to meeting my expectations after first season, but I definitely recommend getting this to anyone looking to get caught up on an amazing show.",1360713600,,797,4.391891891891892

4828400,2,B005LAJ1PE,This is just a weird show...like they are trying to be deep and cutting edge and it just comes off akward. Season 1 is better than season 2 though.,1360713600,2,147,4.103448275862069
4828401,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I'm not finished with the entire Season 1 yet, but I find the story line engaging, the cinematography extraordinary, and the atmosphere frightening.  The writing, acting and directing are exceptional for a TV series, and this is one of -- if not THE -- creepiest TV series ever.  Warning: not for the squeamish -- blood, violence, sex (some deviant), drugs, profanity.  A real classic horror story.",1360713600,2,398,5.0

4828418,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I never knew about this show until I started watching Season 2 - American Horror Story: Asylum. I absolutely love that each season is a complete story - start to finish - and that most of the main actors return each season. I will say, I'm usually stunned that this is on TV, and I'm pretty sure I've given myself some kind of permanent brain damage by taking it all in; but I'm hooked! It shakes me to my core and sticks with me for weeks. I cannot wait for season 3.",1360540800,,468,4.0978260869565215

I'm not much of a fan of horror. I don't like blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts. This show, however, I've found is not over-gratuitous with the gore. It is, however, chock full of weirdness, mystery, suspense, sexual tension, and character and story development. While still certainly not for the squeamish, I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the strange and macabre and to anyone who enjoys a twisted tale of mystery and intrigue.",1360540800,,725,4.534351145038168

4828428,5,B005LAJ1PE,"As a horror genre fan, my expectations are pretty low going into any new movie or TV series. I was also pretty skeptical to believe a TV series with ""horror"" actually in the title would actually deliver. American Horror Story uniquely finds a way to keep suspense up for the entire series... something that most overly produced thriller or horror movies barely attempt.

It's gory, over the top trash but well enough made that  I couldn't stop watching an episode every week or so until I came to the end.  It's full of disturbing images and ideas and definitely not for the sensitive or young.  AMERICAN HORROR STORY (season one)reminded me quite a bit of the old DARK SHADOWS soap opera from the 60's and 70's only much much more graphic.  Talented actress Jessica Lange is great in her portrayal of the manipulative, puzzling Constance and her participation in the series adds some much needed respectability to the entire endeavor.",1360454400,,681,4.689075630252101

4828483,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I loved the house.  I would buy it and live in it if I had millions in spare cash and a desire to live in Los Angeles.  The house was the real star of the show.  In the show, Murder House has a fascinating history and it was interesting throughout the series to learn of its history, the people who died there and the resultant ghosts in the house.

Jessica Lange's performance as Constance is amazing; the character is so complex, half the time I wasn't sure if I loved or hated Constance.  The character of Moira was equally fascinating and contradictory.

Overall, this show was full of dark frights and dark humor.  Thaddeus in the basement was absolutely horrifying and compelling at the same time.  Marcie the realtor and Larry the Burned Man both made me laugh.

On the down side, too much focus on relationships, their downfalls and failures.  Hayden was extremely annoying.  I didn't love the doomed teenage romance story line so much, although I know it was one reason for the shows popularity.

I won't be reviewing American Horror Story:  Asylum.  I hated it!!!!  I watched the first three episodes and gave up on it.",1360108800,3,1129,4.603015075376884
4828484,5,B005LAJ1PE,"When someone gives you an Amazon Gift Certificate and says ""buy yourself something you won't normally get for yourself"" get AMERICAN HORROR STORY! I'd ""heard"" little about the series, and read a few short articles here and there, but after SIX FEET UNDER and OZ, I refused to get involved in serial television at all. And I didn't! A news junkie M-F, and a sci-fi guy on the weekends, I was fine with supplementing repeats and heavily rotated news with something from my eclectic DVD and laserdisc  collection.

I did, however, end up with an Amazon Gift Card from a ""client"" after what was a courtesy photo session...and I saw AMERICAN HORROR STORY ""used/like new"" priced significantly below the list price. OK, why not?  I could always pass it on to a friend if I REALLY hated it. So I bought it.

And the DVD box languished on my shelf. No. I wasn't about to start watching a serialized show. I was too busy. I didn't want the addiction which comes with serial television. Hell. I bought the DARK SHADOWS DELUXE LIMITED EDITION BOX SET of the entire 1,225 episodes...and watched THAT again, after seeing its first run in the 60s, and second run on the SciFi (then) channel in the 80s. But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I had to watch it again.

And then on Super Bowl Sunday, when the rest of the networks were Toilet Bowl television, I thought ""ok, I'll watch one or two episodes and see what's what.""

And two discs later (eight episodes, I think) I had to turn off the television and get to bed.

WHAT A SHOW! WHAT A SHOCKER! WHAT A RIOT!

It took me a few minutes here and there to figure out what was ""really"" going on, and then I was totally hooked. AMERICAN HORROR STORY is definitely a nod to DARK SHADOWS (1966 - 1971) but not about vampires. It's about the house, and the characters and the storyline. But it's also a shocking nod to the headlines of the day (no spoilers here) and is impeccably sequenced, written and filmed.

I'd missed Jessica Lange on the screen for so long, I was surprised and shocked to see she was in the show. Scraping the bottom, Ms Lange? Not in the least! More like on a seriously slow boil with one of the best psychologically-damaged portrayals I'd ever seen. Sheer Jessica Lange. A part written for her, and she just eats it up (literally?) Dylan McDermott was a pleasant surprise. I'd never really been a fan of his, nor had I been a non-fan, but we did go to the same high school (separated by about 3 years) so I like watching a city native (who has a serious backstory of his own!) as a psychiatrist with his personal set of demons sweating it through every episode.

I could go on and on and on, but here's the scoop: if you liked DARK SHADOWS (the original series), Se7en, The Twilight Zone (Rod Serling), SIX FEET UNDER, and some noted classic 60s/70s horror movies (ROSEMARY'S BABY, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL), and some other great, and overlooked, art house and/or indie films (THE FALL, INK) you'll love AMERICAN HORROR STORY.

There's really nothing like watching something terribly original, walking the razor's edge for the usual television fare, and knowing you've got the whole season (""one long movie"") as someone put it...so just put the discs in and enjoy it, episode after episode (try to watch a disc at a time, or at least two/three episodes in sequence).

I'd give this four stars because I know it's going to come to the last episode and the roller coaster ride will be over, but AMERICAN HORROR STORY rates a TEN for me. Everything about it is great.

Watch this with blocks of time, an open mind, open eyes, and put it on pause if you need to leave the room. Missing even five minutes can derail a future character development (or appearance!)

If you love Jessica Lange? This is perfect for you. She's brilliant, and I hope she picks up an award or two. Classic Jessica Lange, updated!",1360022400,,3846,4.539017341040463

4828494,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Note that this review contains minor spoilers.

American Horror Story takes a cliched theme, a haunted house, and completely flips it on its head.

The acting is superb, especially Connie Britton. She of Friday Night Lights fame was a big reason why I decided to give this series a shot. And she didn't disappoint. Neither did any of the other actors. And if they had, this series would have fallen flat on its back.

It has an intriguing beginning set in the past that grips you immediately as two young boys walk in a house, and a young girl, clearly mentally challenged, tells them they will die if they walk inside. Then it shifts to the present with a woman (Britton) who catches her cheating husband in the act. They move to California for a fresh start, as a way to repair what seems like a broken marriage; he cheated on her because she couldn't be intimate after a miscarriage. I believe the average viewer will consider the husband both a vile and sympathetic character, especially as the season progresses. His torment grows over time, exacerbated by the emergence of a house guest, who appears an aging, wrinkled mess to women, but as a sexy fantasy-completing maid to men.

As the season progresses the questions that arise from the first several episodes are slowly fleshed out, almost as they would be in a good novel, in the form of a slow burn that makes you want to run every episode on loop. By the mid-point of the season I had called one of the punchlines, but I really had no idea how it was going to end. I had a hunch, and part of that theory panned out, but this series will keep you on the edge of your seat.

It's less gore and more psychological thriller; Rosemary's Baby crossed with the House on Haunted Hill and the Sixth Sense, it's a series that will surely give you nightmares, and stick with you many days after you've finished.

The bottom line: if paranormal thrillers are your thing, mixed in with some soap opera-ish drama, this series is worth exploring.

4828505,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This show caught me off guard.  I was just expecting a typical haunted house story where a family moves into a house previously populated by many deaths.  It was quickly apparent though that this series goes way beyond that, entering into quirky, odd, bizarre territory.  All of the characters in AHS are exactly that, characters; each with a unique trait many people may be able to identify with, but seeing so many oddball characters gives AHS a certain charm.

Connie Britton's character may be the only one who seems to have normal reactions to the goings on.  But before long, even her sanity seems to crumble under the weight of the house's sadistic past.  This show really puts its characters through the emotional ringer, and many times it's difficult to feel sorry for them, but the longer the show goes on, the more understandable the characters' actions become.

Ah, and it does have some effective horror in it too, although the show's opening scene complete with a score from Saw composer Charlie Clouser hints at more horror than the show typically delivers.  Instead much of the drama plays out like an episode of Desperate Housewives, but more effectively, and the ghosts enter the picture to sabotage the family's lives every now and then.  The best moments of the show for me were the flashbacks, especially those involving Charles the surgeon and his nagging wife.

There's great build up to the big events in the show, as well as some fantastic plot twists I never saw coming.  With such interesting plot devices and increasing drama, it's near impossible not to keep watching to see what happens next.  Thanks so much to Amazon for offering this show free to Prime members.  I can't wait to see all of season 2 in one big marathon.",1359504000,,1752,4.76158940397351

The opening scene had promise, but it then fell into cliche after cliche. ( people splitting up and running around in the dark)  The ending was so anti climatic, not to mention it ripped the ending straight from Beetlejuice. if you have seen Rosemary's baby,sixth sense, beetlejuice, Legend of hell house, The haunting, then their is no need to watch this.

Everything about this show appeals to me, especially since most horror has become annoying and overdone. It's my favorite genre, yet typically I'm disappointed with the b-level dialogue and unnecessary nudity, etc. People who are offended by some of the references and likenesses need to stick to watching their animated bible series instead and let the grown-ups enjoy this one.",1357689600,,526,4.988636363636363
4828552,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I went into this with hesitation and I will continue to do so as the show's creator Ryan Murphy is notorious for creating shows that start out great out of the gate (Nip/Tuck and Glee for example) and after a few seasons descend into utter trash. While this season does have plot points (more like holes) that tend to point toward this show potentially veering off into that direction, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes it's full of unnecessary sex and violence but I love that stuff. While at the root of this show is essentially horror, there are some heart wrenching moments intertwined with the genre (somewhat spoiler alerts) like Violets story and Jessica Lange's background. And this brings us to Ms. Lange. You'll be hard pressed to find a more powerfully executed and nuanced performance from television.

Sure, we were baited in with tantalizing teases of graphic violence, kinky violent sex and five shots of Dylan McDermott`s naked hiney in the first episode alone!

But in the end, we got a lot of regurgitated claptrap composed mostly of scenes, music and entire plot lines directly stolen from other film sources.

Instead of something truly original, we got something plagiarized and repackaged in a blindly flashy package.

4828571,3,B005LAJ1PE,"Pros:
* Really great pilot episode - I was watching it on Netflix, and the pilot alone convinced me to spend the entire day watching the first season of American Horror Story.
*The first couple of episodes after that pilot were almost as good as the pilot.

Cons:
*Starting with the pilot episode, there was almost nothing original about this show.  I started naming off horror/creepy films where I'd seen certain plot elements before:  The Amityville Horror (the entire series seems to draw heavily on that movie); many ghost movies of the past couple of decades (""The Others"" came to mind, particularly in the case of the ghostly maid who shows up out of nowhere to work for the family); even the Goonies.
*I know that this is a hybrid of comedy, horror, and drama, but for me, the drama got to be too much and made the show drag at points; the horror was effective every once in a while, but it seemed like it was maybe toned-down or that the director/writer held-back.  It may have to do with the fact that this was on Fox.  As for the comedy, it was more in the ""camp"" vein, and I think it actually worked against the horror atmosphere that I feel like the director was trying to achieve more than anything.  The two dead nurses in the house that kept popping up throughout the season really overdid the camp for me, as did the man with the half-burnt body.  His character just seemed really corny/out of place.
* Several plot inconsistencies.  For example, some of the deceased in the house appear in the after-life as they did in the moment that they died - as in, spirits who burnt to death appear burnt to a crisp.  However, what doesn't make sense is that other spirits who died in gruesome ways appear completely normal in the afterlife.  Makes absolutely no sense at all to me.  I think it's a really big flaw.
* The school shooting scene was really, really off-putting for me.  I think that since the spirits of those killed in the shooting only appear in one scene and never again, their stories not developed any further than the scene in which they were slaughtered, that scene is really unnecessary and just in bad taste.  Not only that, but the shooting scene is played out so that you watch every single person getting shot, one by one.  Really, really insensitive - maybe if there were some sort of message the director/creator was trying to portray that scene would serve a definite purpose, but I honestly feel like that was not the case, that it was just a scene-filler, and that is just wrong.  That one scene almost ruined the series for me.

OVERALL:
The pilot was really great and made me want to watch more.  The next couple of episodes were good, but not as good as the pilot.  Certain scenes made me want to quit watching it, and the ending was okay but expected/just another horror movie spin-off.  By the time I reached the end, I was glad that I watched it on Netflix and didn't buy it.",1357257600,,2919,4.473584905660378
4828572,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Thanks to having Amazon Prime, I am the newest addict for this amazing show.
Watch the first episode and (fair warning) you will be too.

Jessica Lange was always a favorite of mine but she absolutely mesmerizes in this, in spite of being a lady ""of a certain age"".  I cannot believe how time has not only not hurt her, but has even added immensely to her looks and acting talent, which was always fantastic anyway.  Her acting here is hypnotic and has won her yet another Emmy to add to her collection, this time for best performance in a television series, and I must say this, it is most definitely well deserved. I cannot believe the quality of her acting here, it must be seen to be appreciated.  Her role here started as a very small one, but when her brilliance was seen, she was given much more script, to become a lead character.

A cast of eccentrics, all of whom have a connection to a lovely but extremely haunted old Victorian mansion, all become tightly wedged into the intrigue and drama (and outright horror)  that pervades every second.

The intro to each episode, and the soundtrack, have to be the absolute best that has ever adorned the television screen.  This is a brand of creepiness that I've never encountered anywhere.  How can old photographs of babys and toddlers inspire such a blend of horror? Maybe it's the large lab jars of tiny heads, hands and legs that are flashed on the screen, and the strange horror on the children's faces.  I wish I had twenty minutes of that intro soundtrack.  It's just delicious and creepy, totally brilliant.

Who or rather what is living up there in the attic all these years?  And is that school shooter a ghost, or a warm blooded very alive boyfriend for the oddly appealing adolescent girl, who is a ""cutter""?

What exactly is the mother pregnant with this time?  Who or what impregnated her, dressed in that latex head to toe costume?

And on and on the bizarre plot twists go, each one seemingly more strange than the next.  The storyline is fantastic, the acting is all over the top brilliant, and the settings are very much a part of the action.

I can't praise this highly enough, nor can I ever get my fill of it.  This story of American Horror is spine tingling, albeit gruesome, fun every single second.",1357257600,3,2277,4.536764705882353

This was the most unique and well put together series that could have ever been imagined.  It sets a NEW standard in the Horror genre and I hope the the the Dreck that comes out of hollywood will follow suite.  After watching this entire show, it makes even the most successful blockbuster movies seem ""cheap"" and tiresome.  American Horror and it's superb cast will certainly be hard for any to measure up to.  Jessica Lange just made and owned the entire series for me.  Her unique acting, voice and sensual yet dark presence was what I believe made this the success it was.  I have just started season 2 but I think season one will always be the most successful.  As I said, TV and it's commercialized and mind numbing shows long ago turned me away from ever subscribing to TV again.  I just found this on Amazon and I was hooked.  Brillant writing, producing and Acting will make this show that I hope will redefine the standards.

4828610,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Well into season two now, I wanted to go back and write a review of the first season of one of my favorite television series - especially as season two makes the first season look like ""Mary Poppins"" by comparison!

After reading reviews here, I've realized that those who don't like the show tend to really HATE the show - often with nasty/insulting remarks about everything from the writing to the acting to Dylan McDermott's nude behind.  Am sort of wondering if this venom is because the show isn't mindless or gory enough; American fans of horror tend to like butchers and blood, I have a good friend myself who usually defines a ""good"" horror film by the body count.  The more people who die, and the more gruesome their deaths, the better the film.

If that's you, you WILL probably hate ""American Horror Story"".  The writing here is more subtle, and much more clever.  It's about creeping you out slowly, confusing scenes that come to light later on (sometimes even in another episode) - if you just keep with it and let your brain be engaged instead of your visceral lust for blood and bodies, you'll ""get"" what's going on and understand the storylines and characters so much better.  It's a show that gets under your skin instead of assaulting your senses (and WOW, does season two amp up things, on this scale, a hundred-fold!), and even though season one and season two are two completely different anthologies - with completely different characters (some played by a handful of the same actors from season one) and story and even time-frame - I do think you're cheating yourself a bit if you don't watch the first season before viewing the second (especially to see Jessica Lange's brilliance).

The story's been gone over before: the Harmon family - Ben (Dylan McDermott), Vivien (the brilliant and beautiful Connie Britton), and their teenage daughter Violet relocate from the east coast to Los Angeles, to start fresh after Ben and Vivien's marriage almost ended due to Ben's infidelity.  Ben got an incredible deal on a beautiful home, and only upon the Harmon's arrival do they learn it's because a death occurred in the home.  Well, more than one death.  In fact, a murder.  And suicide.  And more than one.

In fact, their home is known as the Murder House due to its dark and macabre history - a history that starts reflecting itself immediately when we (the viewers) learn that the ghosts of those who've died violently in the home all remain there ... and can still have more than a little influence on the living.

Jessica Lange MORE than deserved the awards gotten for playing next door neighbor Constance Langdon, a southern belle who is the only living person around who knows the true nature of the Harmon's home.  She has a basket-case of a son named Tate (Evan Peters, fast becoming one of the best actors of his generation working today), and a sweet-natured daughter named Addie (Jamie Brewer), a young girl with Down's Syndrome whose condition allows her to see the ghosts who walk the Harmons home when others cannot.

All figure into the a slowly developing plotline that I won't divulge here - but this is, again, one series you cannot only half-watch!  NOT a show where you can get up and make dinner in between, and certainly please pause it if you have to use the john!  No, ""American Horror Story"" takes some thought to keep up with what's going on - and to get the meaning of some things that at first may seem meaningless.  It's smart, wicked, bizzare and very adult television (much like ""Nip/Tuck"", by the same creators) with a dark sense of humor ... that also becomes horribly addicting.

And for gore-lovers ... don't worry, you got that coming in season two.",1356307200,4,3706,4.697063369397218

4828624,5,B005LAJ1PE,"American Horror Story is smart, well written an well concieved. Geniune scares abound in this dark, haunted and wonderfully produced series.

It's always a pleasure to see Frances Conroy she's a terrific actress and I loved her in Six Feet Under, her role here of course is quite different. The entire cast is superb as is the overall production value. We're ""grave"" dep into the new season which is just as well done - and it's great to see so many of the old cast members back for a second go.

Streaming via Roku is effortless and the HD is brilliant, clear and pristine as is the sound even from you TV speakers. There's no buffering and better yet NO commercials. This is a terrific show for any horror fan, and even if you're not you're sure to get a kick out of it.",1355875200,,953,4.44

It's like watching a super long sensational horror movie. Jessica Lange is such a great actress. The whole cast is actually very talented. The actor who plays Tate, Evan Peters, is one of my new favorites. Most of the cast returns in Season 2 playing all new characters. Since this is being considered a mini-series, they can change up the entire story. It's like a whole new ghost story that's just as good as the first.

This has an interesting premise which will bring viewers back week after week. This is a show, I feel that either vieweres will either like or not.

4828635,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I just started watching this show recently and I have to tell you it's amazing, but disturbingly so. I watched the Halloween Pt. 1 and 2 episodes about Tate's past on Thursday 12/13/12 night, past midnight so 12/14 really. As I found out the next morning, a 20 year old man killed 27 people (including himself) and 20 of them were children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The night I watched the show, I remember having felt empathy for the victims-AND Tate himself-and really questioning how we became a society that pushes disturbed individuals to commit such unspeakable acts as those in Columbine and Virginia Tech. After this shocking coincidence, I just wanted to write some reflections in this review. American Horror Story is well a written, thought-provoking paranormal anthology in it's own unique genre. It speaks to the deep, dark parts of the human psyche in an effort to fully understand people at their core. Watch it, but not mindlessly. Enjoy the show, but don't be desensitized to the violence and horrors of real life.

Jessica Lange is great, as is Connie Briton.  But their efforts can't make up for bad writing and a poorly thought out story.

The final episode is just...bad!  It's like the story finished with writing from a 12 year old.  I can't describe to you how disappointed I was in this show.  Forget the 4.5 stars, by the time you get to the end, you will regret it.

Also too much man behind and in case you are wondering I am a woman.  It doesn't make the show better, its like its just there to try and be racy.  Boring not racy, 15 other shows have done it before you.  Not to mention the plot was ridiculous and too much soap opera type drama.  The wife being upset about an affair, him trying to get her to forgive him, blah blah blah.

I don't watch a lot of TV, and often think that TV shows lack a certain continuity to the storyline, like each week they come in and say, ""Okay, what should happen in this week's episode?""  I never felt that way with this show -- in fact, the skilled way in which they connected the episodes often completely surprised me; I don't expect the stories of TV productions to be this well thought out.  It felt more like reading a really good book than a series of disjointed short stories.  It has a wonderful cast as well, so you can expect great acting to go along with the story.

This series will sometimes leave you feeling a little lost but it picks up all the loose ends very well. Even my wife, whom hates horror shows, really liked the story. If you liked the TV show, ""American Gothic"", then you will appreciate this show. This show is one of a few on a very short list of shows that i can not come up with any real negative things about.

This is a show that you must really pay attention too, because missing a smaller detail will through you off the story when bigger details are revealed. I give it four stars only because i felt the husband/wife lead characters i feel were an odd casting, i just had a hard time getting there chemistry to work for me, but it did eventually work for me.",1354492800,,890,4.2976190476190474

4828672,1,B005LAJ1PE,"Great acting, but terrible story...

Spoiler Alert!

A few examples of why this show sucks...

How do you have sex with a fully latexed man and not question who he is?  The kid who is the latex man has a much different body type than her husband.  Her husband is tall and muscular.  This teenage kid is skinny and looks shorter.  All those years of sleeping with her husband and she can't tell?

How does a ghost impregnate a human being?  Not only did he have sex with the mom, but he took her daughter's virginity as well.

I had to laugh when the one armed burnt guy started digging a grave.  How absurd is that?

Overall, I really hate all the characters, especially the family.  We got a sex crazed husband who is weak and hardly does the right thing.  We got a wife who is weaker and just plain stupid.  How do you not know what your daughter is up to? She's wishy washy, one day she wants to keep the house, another day she wants to sale.  She doesn't think it's strange that people just show up at her house at anytime of the day.  We also have a daughter who is angry at the world and is in love with a ghost.  How the heck do you fall in love with a ghost who is a murderer, and she knows!!  Aren't dead people supposed to be ""cold""?

I thought only the people who died at the house can become half ghosts and half living, I guess.  How did those teenagers become ghosts when they died in the library?

Awful TV...I'll stick with The Walking Dead.",1354492800,14,1457,4.146953405017921

The story line keeps your attention to the very end with an amazing ending...very fitting and I guess one could say, comes full circle.  One of those shows where you really enjoyed it but would never want to watch again.  Definitely disturbing.  I won't be watching the 2nd series.  I guess horror in series form is too much for me!

4828678,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I have just finished watching Season 1 on Amazon prime through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roku-2-XD-Streaming-Player-1080p/dp/B005CLPP8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roku 2 XD Streaming Player 1080p</a>&nbsp;(5 stars for both of those too).  Like a well written book and a can of pringles, you cannot watch just one episode.

This single series horror serial has everything - mystery, despair, love, family dysfunction, loss, redemption (of sorts), humor - yes there are parts that I laughed out loud, sex, surprise, and of course . . . horror (some of it of the bloody, depraved kind).

What is wonderful about this series?  Everything - the dialogue, the plot - even though the haunted house thing has been done - pun intended - to death, the acting, the cinematography, lighting, camera angles . . . and the ACTING.  Every single role in this series is well acted.  Jessica Lange is crazy good, literally.

I do not generally like zombie like horror (too predictable), ""blood and guts gore"" or ""stupid blonde"" horror flicks - unless they are so stupid they are funny (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scary-Movie-4/dp/B0026ZH1CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scary Movie 4</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-of-Darkness/dp/B000ICXQOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army of Darkness</a>).

I also do not like the ""running camera"" theory of cinematography with a lot of jiggling and movement.  There is some of that here - just enough.  There is some first person framing, and some very traditional horror angle framing.  In my view, all of it was just enough and not too much.

Some reviewers faulted the series for the sex.  Yes, there is simulated sex in this series (no nudity), but really, nothing even close to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B008CLI4N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and to me, it relates to theme - there is a man vs. woman theme in this series.  The main male character has committed adultery, and is trying to reconcile with his wife.  So, as the various ghosts come on to him, and he ""sees""the sex, it is necessary for writers to get these points home visually.  All of these scenes are relatively short, and relate to internal failings of the male character, or the ""young love"" between the teenagers.

What is particularly surprising here is the ability to take this somewhat overdone horror genre that is fairly predictable (which probably started before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amityville-Horror-Widescreen-Full-Screen/dp/079284677X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amityville Horror (Widescreen/Full Screen)</a>&nbsp;but that is the one I recall most vividly), and make it interesting.

There are a few oddities - for example, the main young male character killed 15 kids at his school (note to those who were critical of the gore aspect, none of the actual kill shots are shown), and some of those kids come back to haunt him, even though they did not die in the house.  These gnawing questions that sometimes drive me nuts were not enough to detract from a core cohesive theme.

If you enjoy very, very good acting, an interesting story, a lot of surprises, and can stand some gore and sex, this is absolutely a not to be missed series. (so is the second season).

4828683,4,B005LAJ1PE,"AHS was a great attempt at a horror tv show.  I think what really made it a good series was the acting.  The Harmon's, Tate, Neighbor(Jessica Lange...Can't believe I forgot her name on the show...starts with a C I think), and the orignal owner's wife gave amazing performances. The standouts being Tate, Lange, and the owners wife.  The show started off fast paced and I couldn't stop from watching back to back to back episodes they were so good, but then they did start to get a little dull.  I was happy with the last few episodes though, which in turn made this 3 star review into a 4 star review.  I think they could have done better with some of the other characters on the show.  They seemed to be too similar to other characters I've seen in movies/tv shows.  Honestly you could have removed those characters and it wouldn't have affected the main story (I don't want to name any characters due to this being spoiler free). I just found them to be corny. To sum things up though, it's a great series, it's free with amazon prime, and something you may watch more than once.

Its a interesting Show with very good actors: Dylan McDermott, Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Evan Peters and as guests we see Matt Ross, Lily Rabe,  Zachary Quinto, Teddy Sears, Christine Estabrook, Frances Conroy, Dennis O'Hare and as uncredited part as the ""Rubberman"" Riley Schmidt.

Yes, the show its a bit different of others and a bit disturbing but interesting and very well made.

The BLU-RAY (Regional CODE: A) : CONTAINS VERY GOOD PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUND.

The Show contains english subtitles but not the bonus-features which are interesting.

4828726,4,B005LAJ1PE,"American Horror Story embodies the realities of modern life (depression, birth issues, infidelity) and mixes them into a deep horror mythos that makes the flawed characters the focus rather than unnecessary special effects, too much blood or insane violence that has recently become what makes up the so-called horror genre. In focusing on the characters and their everyday lives within the construct of the ""Horror House,"" AHS allows us to relate to the story in a very real way. We live through the depressed teen, the terribly troubled unfaithful spouse, the hurt and seemingly fragile mom, so that when something supernatural occurs we are really struck not only by the ""horror"" but the emotional impact.

And why would anyone stay in such a chaotic environment where so many horrific things occur? Because all of their money is wrapped up in the house! This takes the normal ""why stay"" mentality we experience in lesser thought out horror shows or movies and turns it into something we not only can relate to, but that makes us feel even more deeply for the troubled souls who live there...alive or otherwise.

Dylan McDermott somehow carries the tortured role to a wonderful apex, especially with his eyes. Jessica Lange gives a great performance time and time again, from the troubled mother, the nasty spiteful neighbor, the commanding lover...she has such a range! I personally love that the series doesn't feel the need to interject copious amounts of blood or language, so that we can focus on the fun of the fright. From ghosts, urban legends, Halloween tales, mutants and more, this show has a little bit of every corner of the horror genre.

I only wish this release had some special features.  There are some things that would have been great to both hear commentary on as well as see behind the story.",1353024000,3,1817,4.8896103896103895

4828730,3,B005LAJ1PE,"'American Horror Story' (2011) is an innovative series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for FX, and one which further evolves the post-modern television thriller, a process which began with David Lynch's influential 'Twin Peaks' (1990-1991) and continued with Chris Carter's more commercially successful 'The X-Files' (1993-2002).

Murphy and Falchuk clearly intend 'American Horror Story' to be as visually and narratively extreme as a program can possibly be for the current market, and so it comes as no surprise that the show does not air on the Fox channel itself.

The plot has Ben (Dylan McDermott) and Vivienne (Connie Britton) Harmon and their teenage daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) moving from Boston to Los Angeles after Ben is caught in an adulterous affair with a young woman. The family buys a sprawling old mansion built in the 1920s, and Ben, a psychiatrist, sets about reestablishing his practice.

Almost immediately, bizarre events begin to take place in and around the house. The Harmons also discover that their next door neighbor, Constance (Jessica Lange), is an intrusive, insistent, and increasingly threatening presence in their lives.

Since Vivienne no longer trusts Ben, the couple finds coping with their impossible experiences difficult and isolating, while Violet, who is bullied at her new school, secretly begins a relationship with young Tate (Evan Peters), one of her father's troubled patients.

'American Horror Story' certainly has an overall style of its own, and it becomes almost immediately clear to the viewer that the creators intend to heap an absolute maximum  superabundance of 'paranormal' events on the Harmons and on the audience. The Val Lewton-Jacques Tourneur ""less is more"" style of horror, seen in such classics as 'Cat People' (1941) and 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), is clearly not a style admired by Murphy and Falchuk.

While the dominant 'supernatural' presence is a male figure in a zippered, head-to-toe black rubber body suit, there are also a pair of twin boys who have been murdered, a hideous dwarfish monster in the basement, a succubus of a housemaid who appears elderly to Vivienne but young and attractive to Ben, a pair of dead nurses, a 'mad doctor' and his anguished wife, the ghosts of two male homosexuals who believe the mansion still belongs to them, a horribly-scarred man who claims to have killed his own family, the spirit of Elizabeth Short, and others.

And why is Vivienne's new pregnancy causing such alarm?

'American Horror Story' offers not '13 Ghosts,' but seemingly 113 or more.

As a result of this barrage of what are essentially old-fashioned monsters in newfangled  dress, 'American Horror Story,' while remaining interesting, becomes increasingly less suspenseful with each episode; the sense of objective reality is increasingly diminished, making it less and less possible to believe that Ben, Vivienne, and Violet are actually alive and existing in an ostensible 'real world' shared with the audience.

While many previous films (of some ninety minutes or thereabouts) have utilized such a veiled technique to great effect, here, viewers of 'American Horror Story,' which is some five hundred minutes in length, are likely to simply stop caring whether the proceedings are actual, illusory, supernatural, or some combination of these. As in 'Lost' (2004-2010), answers to mysteries are often either too long in coming, only partial when finally revealed, or simply not addressed at all. It's an exhausting process.

Viewers will easily recognize homages and references to older horror films throughout the series, from Whale's 'The Old Dark House' (1932), Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968), Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' (1973), Curtis' 'Burnt Offerings' (1976) Kubrick's 'The Shining' (1980) and Fulci's 'The House By the Cemetery' (1981) to Argento's 'Phenomena' (1985) and Amenabar's 'The Others' (2001), as well as the marked influence of David Lynch, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Nancy Grossman. 

To their credit, Murphy and Falchuk (here and in season two, 'American Horror Story: Asylum,' 2012, which begins an entirely new narrative) actually root the source of their horrors in actualities like Nazism and all it entailed, necrophilia, genetic deformity, psychosis, serial murder, disfiguring scars, sadomasochism, limb amputation, self-mutilation, sexual pathology and perversion, abortion (dead babies, the severed limbs of children, and deformed offspring are everywhere in 'American Horror Story'), Draconian laws, personal betrayal and other fear-inducing elements of life; it is these  'actualities,' possible in everyone's life, that give the show its weird, gruesome, and often unpleasant power.

Boris Karloff once said that he preferred 'terror films' to 'horror films,' as the latter were, in his opinion, largely designed to disgust and revolt rather than frighten. Karloff, then, wouldn't have appreciated 'American Horror Story,' which, in addition to bald sexuality, straddles both 'terror' and 'horror' and pushes the proverbial envelope to its absolute currently-accepted limit.",1352937600,2,5108,5.494897959183674

4828751,5,B005LAJ1PE,"When we were watching this on television, we kept asking ourselves, ""what can they possibly do next?""  The sheer number of horror movie tropes and stereotypes is staggering.  However, this is a clever show, and it knows what it's doing.  Whereas season 2 is all about communal fears that America had in the 1960s, this first season is about personal fears and the things that we, as individuals, are most afraid of in America (losing our money, our partners cheating on us, our families breaking down, etc.).  The house in this show is great at reflecting back on its inhabitants their worst fears and most secret guilty desires.  It has a way of giving each of the Harmons what he/she wants while at the same time taking away something vital.

It's classic gothic, and also classic horror.  I really can't recommend it enough to people who love horror or even people who study the gothic.",1352246400,,889,4.696774193548387

4828754,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I came into this expecting a really generic horror television show with really awful jump scares and bad effects. Boy was I wrong, it look about three minutes for me to get sucked into the odd camera editing and angles, bizarre noises and music, and fantastic cast and story line. This isn't just another ghost story, American Horror Story is revitalizing the genre for what it is, a masterpiece.
Now I realize this show has flaws, I'm not saying it's perfect. The story line got a little confusing and I actually rewatched the entire season from start to finish just to make sure I knew what happened, and I enjoyed every minute of all 12 episodes, both times. I actually enjoyed it more the second time.
Another thing I want to add: This show doesn't exactly follow the rules of normal paranormal style shows. It basically made its own rules and just hit the ground runnin'.
Moving on, the acting this season was just plain great. All characters were blowing me away, seriously. Even the extras who had maybe one or two lines, were great. Overall I can't complain at all about the acting.
Now for the scares, and this is the last thing. This show has probably three or four jump scares throughout all twelve episodes, which, frankly I enjoyed, because as long as they're not being overused, I enjoy jump scares. The horror is mainly suspense, and there is LOTS of that. I found myself quite nervous on multiple occasions, waiting for something to happen, whether it did or not, I was anxious.
Overall I give the show an easy 5 stars.",1352073600,,1535,4.605839416058394

4828757,5,B005LAJ1PE,"If AMERICAN HORROR STORY doesn't give you nightmares, nothing will. There is nothing like this show on TV and it is beyond creey and scary. It is am homage to every horror film that has come before it and you'll be hooked after the first episode. Of course, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is not for the faint of heart or people easily scared by things that go bump in the night even if it is only on TV. AMERICAN HORROR STORY is beyond all horror and thrillers you have ever seen.
AMERICAN HORROR STORY is an actor's dream. There is depth to the characters and we see them over and over. This show was also a casting director's dream (or maybe nightmare). I can't imagine a more thoroughly perfect cast. Everyone plays his or her role with true delight. I could easily spend pages delving into each character and actor but let me start with one of the best. Jessica Lange is at her absolute best as freaky neighbor Contance Langdon. She puts the C in creepy and gee, she is not even one of the dead people in the show. She is attached heart and soul to the picturesque Victorian mansion next door.
New buyers Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott), his wife Vivien (Connie Britton) and daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) have the misfortune of moving into the house after a couple of family tragedies. Little do they know they have moved into LA's infamous ""murder house."" These three actors are just perfect for their roles. Britton can tell stories of joy, sadness and fear just from her facial expressions. Farmiga is the perfect troubled teen trying to make sense of a crazy world.
The fun of AMERICAN HORROR STORY is watching each episode and learning about the ""people"" who share murder house with the Harmons. Try not to learn to much of the plot ahead of time and just watch everything unravel. Who is dead and who isn't? Murder House is the a place of eternal misery. People who die in that house, whether by murder or natural causes, never leave.
Another fascinating character is Jamie Brewer as Addie, Constance's daughter who was born with Down's Syndrome.
Brewer is great in her role. Is she evil or just a victim of a horrible parent. She sees dead people. Then there is Evan Peters as Tate. Another great role of a trouble teenager with a seriously troubled past.
So many characters have connections that should be revealed as you watch the series and not in a review.
And to add to the mix, we have Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge as the mysterious housekeeper Moira O'Hara?
Why two actresses in one role? You'll find out soon enough and it's a stunner. Both actresses are perfect in their roles. Another standout is Kata Mara as Hayden McClaine. If you're having trouble with your ex-mistress, just wait until she is dead and starts visiting your wife!
Another of my favorites is Zachary Quinto as one-half of the dead gay couple that lives in the house. You see my point about not knowing too much about the plot before you start watching? Such great writing and it makes me wonder what nightmares the writers were having to come up with all this horror and thrills.
Watching this great cast interact is part of the fun of AMERICAN HORROR STORY. We get to learn the back story of this house built in the 1920's for a famous doctor and his wife and son. Here is the beginning of the murder house.
AMERICAN HORROR STORY also makes references to the 1940's murder of Elizabeth Short known forever as ""The Black Dalia"" and even the murder of actor Sal Mineo in the 1970's. Nothing is left unturn and no subject is taboo.
AMERICAN HORROR STORY is addictive but it does have plenty of plot holes. We never know why the house seems to have a life and power of its own and why it feeds on human tragedy. Why are the souls trapped? Why do Constance and Addie see dead people? I could go on and on with questions but just sit back and enjoy these creepiest and scariest ride of your life.",1352073600,2,3886,4.513475177304964

I think I watched the whole season in a few days!  The writing of this show is also very good although there are some scenes that were probably not necessary.  It became very sexual and graphic with some parts.  I guess the gore and sex goes with the horror territory.  It probably would have been worse on HBO or Showtime.  Despite that, still love the show, even so much more than the second season!  Wished the writers would have continued with the original storyline and cast for the second season.  : (",1351987200,,646,4.6371681415929205

4828787,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I thought this show was unique and disturbing.  The whole show made me uneasy all the way through.  I had a hard time warming up to the family, but did eventually (the mom was kind of a snob, especially towards Jessica Lange's character).  The flashbacks to prior murders in the home were unsettling (although sometimes derivitive).  I didn't always like their music choices. (The Twisted Nerve song I thought was misplaced.  I don't think it should have been used because it's a song that almost feels specific to Kill Bill.  I immediately thought of Kill Bill and Darryl Hannah walking down the hallway in the nurse's uniform when they showed the boy walking down the hallway of his school. Probably a song that really shouldn't be used in a movie or show again...)  There were some things that I'm not sure were inconsistencies or something I just missed (I only watched the series once through), particularly the history between Jessica Lange and the maid (**SPOILER**:  Why was the maid the only one that aged?  And what happened to Lange's husband who was shot? Maybe someone could reply and explain **END SPOILER**).  I would recommend this to people who are open to a show that is more of a disturbing tale rather than something you'd consider scary. Oh, and also someone who isn't turned off by more-or-less aberrant sexual content.",1351123200,,1341,4.816593886462882

4828789,4,B005LAJ1PE,"After watching the first episode of season 2 of ""American Horror Story: Asylum"" I had to go back and tear through the first season. While I have to say that so far season 2 is superior, nonetheless season 1 is still well worth watching. You can almost visualize the writing staff sitting around asking themselves what they love most about horror movies and then finding the best way to shock and horrify hardcore fans with the best that the genre has to offer. If some of the scenarios or forbidding music feel familiar, you're absolutely correct but these thefts feel more like an homage than a rip-off (music from ""Carrie"" and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" are used particularly well). The cast is just phenomenal in both seasons and I can't say enough positive things about the boldness of starting from scratch with a fresh story in season 2 while using largely the same troupe of actors. Jessica Lange just oozes talent in very scene while Zachary Quinto and the rest of the cast do a fine job all around. If you've ever enjoyed a good spooky story in the form of a novel, movie, or simply sitting in the dark at a slumber party as a kid, I urge you to watch this show.",1351036800,,1168,4.488262910798122

Sometimes it is a little hard to follow as it focuses on the past and current residents of a wonderful old home.

Jessica Lange is fantastic and makes the show one of the best I've seen in quite a while. The whole cast really gels to make the program believable.",1351036800,,482,4.25

If you're looking for an addictive show that will leave you wanting more, this is the show for you. I was completely sucked in and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a great story with lots of twists and suspense. Kudos to the writers for making a show that's actually worth watching on regular cable. I absolutely love it!

Although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, if you're looking for something other than crime dramas, sitcoms or ""honey boo boo"" reality swill, AHS is a nice change of pace.  It kept me interested throughout and I appreciated the dark humor and irony, as well as the hint of social commentary.  One caveat, as with any of the more successful FX TV series, this is loaded with coarse language and gritty, disconcerting scenes.  If you are familiar with or watch FX's  SOA and Justified, and/or AMC's Breaking Bad and Walking Dead, then you know exactly what I mean.",1350777600,,639,4.5701754385964914

4828799,2,B005LAJ1PE,"I bought this series with much happy expectation because of all of the 5-star reviews I saw on Amazon. In my first review I gave the series 1 star. A number of commenters insisted that I give it a second look because they were sure I had missed some of the merits of the show. So I watched the entire series a second time and have rewritten my review.
I strongly dislike the series for three reasons:
1) There are far too many pieces and parts of many other movies, television shows, popular novels, infamous serial killer histories and related well-known events. These are far more extensive than homage shout outs like Iron Man referring to Thor as ""Point Break"" in ""The Avengers"". In many cases whole plot lines are lifted. It gives me the impression that instead of coming up with their own creative presentation, the writers chose to take the easy way out by using what others have done. (The Offal in my title refers to the eating of raw organ meat by a pregnant woman in this series...just like ""Rosemary's Baby"" and indeed she does give birth to the antichrist! Help!) Even passages of music that have been made famous in other movies such as Kill Bill and Bram Stoker's Dracula were incorporated, which were sometimes so inappropriate that I had to shake my head and laugh in disbelief. One commentator said I fail to understand pastiche. Maybe. If this is pastiche, I think it is very poorly done. In particular, lifting so many actual events specific to the Columbine Massacre and adding them to the story was very offensive. The writers didn't have to do it that way. I would hate to be a friend or relative of those victims and stumble across this series. But hey, anything for a buck, right?
2) The story is delivered like a madman firing a machine gun. There is no depth and no chance to build the tension necessary in great horror because the writers and directors are busy cramming every story line, murder, attack, sexual liaison, rape, bloodletting and outrage they can think of into every episode. Thus, instead of experiencing horror, the viewer becomes numb. Half way through the series there are at least 20 ghosts in the house and twice that many murders. It actually becomes boring due to overkill. Instead of adding dozens of story lines that go nowhere, they should have carried a few story lines to their conclusions. It would have made the characters far more interesting. I thought perhaps they intended to do this in the second season but no; the second season is in a new location and a different era.
3) I don't think that it is asking too much to expect that a series called American Horror Story would scare you at some points. It is the way the product was described and I was ready for a good ghost story but I wasn't ever frightened or even surprised throughout all 12 episodes. I have since noticed that even in the 4 and 5-star reviews, many people say that the show does not frighten them. That may be fine for some viewers but for me it is a major ding.
I can't blame the actors or actresses. They must work with what they are given and they all seem to do the best they can. And certainly the project is well-funded with many attractive sets and costumes. On second viewing those assets were more obvious to me and therefore I have rewritten my review with an added star. I personally dislike giving an item a poor review but this is as high as I can go.
That being said, if I had it to do over again, I would not have blown $35 on this series. I have since learned that many professional reviewers have panned this series and I shall check with them from now on before I make a purchase sight unseen. I recommend that if you are curious, you watch the reruns and save your money.",1350604800,23,3723,4.476470588235294

(5 bucks to rent all episodes for 3 days) right now i say i would only watch once but in the long run i would probably end up giving them thirty and then buying it at some point. its their loss.

American Horror Story is the perfect combination of horror, suspense, history and drama. Every week unveils a little more, and adds more questions. And they all get answered...but in a much better way than you could ever imagine. I am going back and watching it again now, and it is even better the second time through.

SPOILER:
The only thing that I did not like about this show is that everyone in the family dies.

I understood the daughter's death, but why her parents? Was it the show was getting lower ratings towards the end? Were the actor's contracts up after one season? Who knows. I get that things were rocky with the parents from the get go. I think the storyline would have been more interesting, to me, if the parents survived and were able to move out of that house. However, the baby being a harbor for evil would bring the evil with him to their new home. I am interested in what Asylum will bring. I am confused as to why Zachary Quinto is being brought back, even though he is a great actor, but what about the baby?

There are not that many one hour shows that can keep my attention all the way to the end.  In fact, it seemed like each episode came to an end way too fast.  It did not feel like the hour was up.  I think I could have stayed glued to two hour episodes.

I am amazed at how one of the cast members is left out of the promotions for this show.  Evan Peters was just so creepy.  He was a major player in the show and almost as scary as his mother.  Kick Ass was one of my favorite movies from a couple years ago and I thought he did a fantastic job in that movie too.

I am looking forward to the new season.",1349395200,,912,3.8181818181818183

For anybody who loves creepy flics and series, this one is excellent. Not to mention some excellent plot twists.

I already can't wait for season 2 to air...

As far as the dvd product itself: It's perfectly fine. I'm not usually the type to go through extras and whatnot so I can't say anything there, but the dvd's work and for me that's all that matters. :)",1349136000,,605,4.4324324324324325

4828827,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Despite its memorably creepy and pulsating title sequence, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is actually shorter on scares than I would have liked. The show's creators, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk (the creators of GLEE and NIP/TUCK), seemed far more interested in creating a complex narrative and a comprehensive mythos than in genuinely scaring their audience; yet even so, the series is still gripping and stays with you. The show is more than a miniseries than a series, with the episode run forming a narrative more or less complete in itself: a dysfuncional small family from Boston buys a faux-Jacobean mansion in Los Angeles, and discovers not only that it is ""The Murder House"" featured in local civic tours of gothic LA but that the many slaughtered occupants in the house cannot rest and can actively menace them. Murphy and Falchuk seem so wound up in going over the top as much as they can in the show's absurdly eventful two-hour pilot that most of the potential for instilling fear in its audience is drained right out. If you make it past about the third episode, however, the show builds up enough narrative momentum so that its elaborate entangling becomes fairly engrossing; and the fact that the Murder House has fairly consistent rules to its haunting (which become slowly revealed as the show works its way to its conclusion) is also quite satisfying.

The best thing about the show are the little murderous incidents in the house's past that begin each episode; there's a lot of morbid narrative pleasure to be had in waiting for the former inhabitants to get it, usually as awfully as possible. The supporting actors who make up the various victims and victimizers in the house's history (some of whom remain around it still in the show's present, both living and dead) are some of the best actors working in the United States today, and are more than enough reason to watch the show. Jessica Lange (a deserved winner of the Emmy and the Golden Globe for the show) gets to play the most complex and fun character, a Virginia-bred neighbor who can turn in a second from honeyed hospitality to poison vindictiveness; she offers basically a Master's Class in Gothic acting, and she's well supported by a number of other superb actors such as Christine Estabrook, Denis O'Hare and Lily Rabe as her fellow walking wounded. Less effective are the actors who play the central Harmon family members who have moved into the house; through some dreadful and shallow creative decision, the Harmons are envisioned as sexy glamorpusses rather than as more ordinary people, and so it takes a while to feel much sympathy for or interest in Dr. Ben Harmon, with his improbably perfect ripped abs, or for his wife Vivien, with her eternally fabulous hair. (When does she even find time to go to the salon between all the hauntings and murder attempts?) The actors in question, Dermot Mulroney and Connie Britton, are both quite fine, but they seem centrally miscast, or at least far too done up and prettified. Fortunately they don't much get in the way of Lange and company (and Britton manages ultimately to turn in quite a strong performance overall).",1349049600,3,3149,4.842300556586271
4828828,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I won't go into detail about each episode with this series, because others have done a great job doing that.  I just want to give my general thoughts on this series.  My feelings about this show can be summed up in two words......Jessica Lange!!!  She portrays a southern matriarch with a dark twist.  Her ability to switch from sugar-sweet to a blood letting B*%#H is worth the purchase of this alone.  I would liken her performance in this series to that of Elizabeth Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.  In both of these you have a very strong southern woman who is not afraid to take charge of the situation.  The writers of this series should also be praised for constructing a story that hooks the viewer from the beginning, and then leads us down many dark hallways to understand just how haunted this house truly is.  The thing I really liked about the Horror Story is that it is self-contained.  I don't want to give anything away, but I was quite surprised at the ending.  I am on the edge of my seat as I wait for the beginning of Season Two of this fantastic series.  In the meantime, I will enjoy going back and watching Jessica deliver lines that make me want to whip up a Mint Julep and enjoy it in my swing on the verandah, while perhaps taking a crack shot at the neighbor's annoying dog (insert dark laughter here).  If you're looking for a show that has a great storyline, fantastic acting, and darkly twisted, The American Horror Story is the show for you!!",1349049600,6,1474,4.398523985239852
4828829,1,B005LAJ1PE,"I'm going to finish this show because I spent like $40 on the darn thing, BUT ... <spoiler alerts ahead> ... halfway through, I'm desperately scrambling to find some reason to like it.

I mean ... quick ... name your top 5 favorite horror films of all time. Name what you see as the critically recognizable best top 10 horror films of all time. Know what all 10 of these films have in common? YOU LIKE AT LEAST ONE FRIGGIN CHARACTER! I mean, sheesh! Every last person in this thing - over hours and hours - fails to present one scene that makes you care if they live or have their heads chopped off!

Obviously, every last dead character is detestable. And the neighbor, Jessica Lange, is supposed to be detestable (telling her daughter to spit into a cupcake for the neighbors; locking her mentally challenged daughter in a closet with mirrors, etc....).

But our three living house owners are also all horrible human beings. The daughter is BEYOND rotten to the core. She's falling for a dead, Columbine killer clone ... so much so that she lies about her mom's trauma AND orchestrates it so that her mom is stuck in a house that is destroying her. I could go on and on and on. She is, in my oppinion, the most detestable of all the characters though.

And then there's the mom. Look, the husband cheated. That sucks and it's a jerky thing to do. But, she doesn't spend even one scene trying to be nice to him. She screams at him every friggin episode. She drives him from the house, she whines incessantly. She tries to move to Boston with the daughter. She. Is. Awful. HORRIFIC.

The dad's probably the best character. But he sure doesn't make you smile and he did cheat on her wife.

Horrific.

Please. Someone please tell me - give me a reason - to like any character in this thing, some reason to root for these guys. Anything?",1349049600,6,1834,4.440476190476191

4828832,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I had mixed feelings after watching AMERICAN HORROR STORY on DVD.  I'm glad I didn't watch it on FX----spared me the commercials!  On one hand, AHS grabbed my attention in its early episodes and I thought this was going to be an incredibly fresh and innovative television series.  But somehow the show took a sudden dip and what seemed original or trend-setting suddenly became muddled, redundant as if the writers developed a mid-season inertia, unsure of its direction.  I likewise was disappointed with the show's rather flimsy conclusion.
However, AHS is not a failure.  There are several effective scenes and some unexpected twists.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  Golden Globe/Emmy winner Jessica Lange is simply stunning as the twisted Constance Langdon, who dominates every scene she's in.  Connie Britton is perfect as Vivian, the beleagured wife/mother required to run the gamut in an extremely demanding role.  The often critically panned Dylan McDermott didn't wow me as the misguided Ben, but his performance is overshadowed by his female counterparts.  Other notable performances:  Frances Conroy, Evan Lewis, Zachary Quinto, Denis O'Hare, Michael Graziadei, Eric Stonestreet and Lily Rabe.  Don't get me wrong, though--AHS is far superior to the flat  muck of most network garbage I try to avoid and I'm definitely looking forward to season 2.

I am an avid horror fan and I enjoy everything from the serial killer, the monsters, the zombies, the suspenseful family-member related stuff, the blood, guts and gore, the Sci-Fi horrors, the ghosts....everything. This somehow manages to combine everything into one for the most captivating series that you just can't look away from. There were parts where I wanted to cover my eyes. There were parts where I wanted to cry. There were parts where I felt like I was part of the show and something would affect me directly. It has ties to real life things that go on, affairs, abortions, births, deaths, school violence, bullying, secrets, spousal issues...and makes them a million times more interesting. The actors were fantastic. Every main character in the show was Emmy-Worthy. The most exciting part of my whole week was waiting for Wednesday night at 10 to turn on FX to watch this show. The twists and turns and unexpected events that happen are just impeccably written and well thought out. It leaves you on the edge of your seat begging for more. Truly a 5 Star, A Plus show and I am so excited to watch it all again when I buy the First Season.

Towards the end, it does start to unravel. The strong ideas that were developed towards the beginning start to dissolve - and it becomes noticeable that the series was written as it went along. Early stories become red herrings, significant characters are soon forgotten about, and it starts to feel like you're not really being looked after as the audience. The final episodes were a real let down - they just didn't feel satisfying.

Its a shame because it had so much potential at the beginning - a modern Twin Peaks, packed with intrigue and ballsy writing. But it just couldn't hold it together. By the end you might be frustrated that you'd invested any time in it at all.",1347667200,16,817,4.746478873239437

A story concept like this does not come around often and the fact that the setting changes every season is even better. This concept has been used by shows that are fluid with who you see on television but i have rarely seen it done with a show that has a true plot line that deepens throughout. It gives the audience a chance to envision new elements of horror from different themes.

Several months later, enter Amazon Instant Video: knowing absolutely nothing about the show except for hearing great things about it from friends, I went ahead and bought the first season.  Within the span of 3 days my husband and I watched the entire season and LOVED it!  At first I was like ""what the heck is going on?"" but soon you are so into the show that you don't want to stop!

As far as the actual product, I purchased Season 1 via Amazon Instant Video in SD.  I thought about buying HD but decided to save a few dollars by getting it in standard definition.  I will say that that difference in the picture quality is noticeable if you are watching the show on a big screen (over 40 inches).  However, soon you get so involved in the story line that it doesn't even matter.  We also watched this on a 22 inch screen and weren't affected by the picture quality at all, in fact I didn't even think about the fact that it wasn't in HD.

If you are an HD fanatic, then you will want to buy the HD version.  If you are less sensitive to it or are planning to watch this on a small screen then you will be fine with standard definition.",1343088000,4,1255,4.148760330578512

Too bad season 2 will be completely different (with Jessica Lange being the main character) but I think it'll be interesting to see how they carry on. Rumor is, a few seasons from now, they'll go back to the ending of season one (Jessica Lange and the highly coveted kid) and continue with that story. But until then, season 2, set in a mental hospital (hope it's not cheesy) should be a change from your everyday mental hospital story. But don't get too used to Jessica Lange's character in season 1! She'll be completely different come the October season premiere.

The first episode was a bit confusing, but after episode two I began understanding the underlying theme and sub plots. As a horror/suspense fan I have really been looking for a series like this one for a long time, not since Stephen King's ""Kingdom Hospital"" has a series gotten my attention the way this one has. It's not for those who have difficulty reading between the lines and filling in gaps where the action is alluded to but not actually shown. About the only negative thing I can say about this show is that the creators have ""borrowed"" a lot from other stories and movies. Examples being the characters of the twins (The Shining),The housekeeper (The Others),The home invaders in episode three (The Strangers) etc. But overall the cast is very strong and I absolutely LOVE Jessica Lange. The cinematography is great the music is just funky enough, and the story is solid. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good suspenseful drama",1342396800,,1036,4.761111111111111

I would wait all week for it to come on, and when the time came I'd be curled up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn waiting rather impatiently for the opening credits. BUT, as the season progressed I found a couple of things that were starting to get on my nerves a bit. One being the character Tate. He was interesting at first, but by the end of the show you just want him to disappear. All he's ever done is wine about Violet and pine over her constantly. That's all there is to him, really. The next annoying part of the show was probably the maid. I have nothing against the older woman, since her part in the show has promise, but I don't like the fact that they have the slutty version of her prancing around trying to seduce Ben multiple times in every episode. Seemed a bit like a desperate cry from the producers saying, ""PLEASE WATCH OUR SHOW"", because really, her part could have been toned down a whole lot and the show would have still been just as good - if not better.",1340150400,6,1017,4.141414141414141

The cast is superb. New comers Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters (Kick-Ass) hold their own against powerhouse actors like Jessica Lange, and Dylan McDermott. Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights) in simply brilliant proving her previous work does not give her due credit like this show. The supporting cast is full of A-listers such as Zachary Quinto (Heroes, Star Trek), Mena Suvari (American Beauty), and Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under). Also, it being an anthology series, the first season has a beginning and a satisfying ending. Each season will take place in a different location with different characters.

4828893,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I love the Horror genre, and it is difficult to find a good show like American Horror Story. The reviews seemed to be mixed, so I didn't have high expectations going in, but it is one of my new favorites.  It is both grotesque and beautiful, and will definitely horrify you, and possibly cause some nightmares.

The characters are well-written, but few of them are really likeable.  They are mostly ghosts that have died and become trapped in the house, most of them murdered.  There are humans, which are the main characters, but I found the dead ones to be much more complex and interesting.  The show blurs the lines of good and evil, as well as living and dead.  It is difficult to tell whether some characters are good, evil, or even alive.  Figuring out the puzzle is a nice part of the show.

It has a lot of twists and turns, and I can honestly say it is one of the first times I have been genuinely surprised by a plot twist in a series.  The end leaves you wondering how the show can even go on to another season, and eagerly anticipating the next season.",1334880000,,1065,4.338383838383838
4828894,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Ah, AMERICAN HORROR STORY. You know, aside from the wonderfully wacky performances by Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, Kate Mara and Denis O'Hare, as well very strong performances by Taissa Farmiga (who looks so much like her older sister Vera that it's creepy), Connie Britton (who is so gorgeous, it hurts), Frances Conroy and her younger, much sexier self Alex Breckenridge, Lily Rabe, Matt Ross, Jamie Brewer, and my personal favorite, Zachary Quinto... there's not much here.

Well, you know, except for scenes like Vivien eating a cooked human brain, and believe me, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is LOADED with scenes like that. Ryan Murphy (responsible for another terrifically addictive FX show NIP/TUCK) and his co-showrunner and longtime colleague Brad Falchuk set out to create something that defies expectation of a horror story but keeps you in the game with its deceitfully addictive adult soap opera bits, all the while as parts of the show's mystery unravel as more questions are raised.

What caused the house to be like this? Was it just the first murders, or was there something deeper? What does Constance really want with the Harmons? Does each new pope really get a message like the one presented in this show? Will Chad and Patrick ever get their perfect Halloween? Does Ben just REALLY like the stove?

Actually, the best question is WHY DON'T THEY JUST LEAVE? That's the question that we all find ourselves screaming at the television when the show is on. And the answer to that question, initially, is this is the stupidest family to have ever soiled the earth with the imprints of their feet. There might as well be a sign out in front of the house that says ""I'M HAUNTED, MORONS!"" and the Harmons would keep crossing that threshold without a moment's hesitation. It's really too obvious, but you're having too much fun with Adelaide's constant break-ins, Tate's whole ""I'm totally tortured and indisputably dangerous, but feel free to date me"" vibe, Constance's casual racism, Hayden's instantaneous transformation from cuckolded lover to bat-$#1T CRAZY, the twins, the Frankenstein baby and Chad's fabulousness.

However, as time goes on, Murphy and Falchuk do a very smart thing. They force a family member out of the house, and just a bit later, they force another family member to stay in the house. I'd hate to spoil anything here (other than Viv eating the brain, because that was awesome), but the answers are shocking. And what's even more important is that they work in the context of the show.

The show is about truth and illusion, and coming from NIP/TUCK, Murphy and Falchuk are uniquely suited to do such a show. The illusion that this house will somehow save Ben and Vivien's too-fragile marriage as well as the eternally increasing distance from their teenage daughter Violet (who is already half a sociopath as the show starts). The truth is that the house, and its secrets, will destroy them the longer they stay; ultimately, the truth (no matter how painfully obvious it is) is not as powerful as the illusion.

Another big part of this show's success is consulting producer and staff writer Tim Minear. Minear is a singular talent in genre entertainment. His ideas and his energy are always helping to branch out and make better whatever program he's working on. Sadly for Minear, all of the shows he's been a producer of (despite their pretty consistent level of excellence) have been cancelled. FIREFLY, STANDOFF, DRIVE, THE INSIDE, THE CHICAGO CODE, TERRIERS, WONDERFALLS... all ashes either during or just after their first seasons. His other shows like ANGEL and DOLLHOUSE actually lasted for at least two seasons, and AHS will join the ranks of those two shows, since it's been picked up for a second season on FX.

Make no mistake: AMERICAN HORROR STORY is not a very good horror show, though. Is it creepy? Sure it is. But this show, aside from a few tingly moments (and that can go a few different ways since the show is pretty sexy at times too) doesn't offer much to actually scare you. It's more ""How CRAZY can we make this show?"" rather than ""How SCARY can we make this show?"" and that's problematic at times. Also, there are few actors I've seen in my life that are as wooden and utterly charmless as Dylan McDermott. He's always been the poor man's David Duchovny, much as Bill Pullman is the poor man's Alec Baldwin.

Whether or not the new season will focus on a new family and/or a new house remains to be seen. Frankly, I hope that it, at the very least, doesn't change location because there's just way too much fun to be had with these characters. The only reason I would actually like them to go elsewhere is to escape from McDermott, because he adds nothing to the show.",1334707200,4,4729,4.808118081180812

I would compare it's insanity to that of Nip/Tuck, which makes sense when you realize the same creators are behind it. The first episode will probably confuse most people, but stick with it. Each episode will answer questions from the previous ones and leave you with even more than the last. The cast is beyond superb. Jessica Lange as neighbor Constance is the homerun of the series for me. She plays that role with such conviction and is very deserving of the Emmy Award she won. The rest of the cast is top-notch as well, including Connie Britton (you may know her from Friday Night Lights) who's character is put through an emotional rollercoaster throughout the entire season.

This show plays off as creepy more than scary, but it works splendidly. American Horror Story is definitely out there. Sometimes you'll just scratch your head and think, ""what is going on?"". Then you'll figure it out and it's well worth the confusion. They tackle some dark subject matter and this is really not a show for kids. You'll find a good bit of nudity and sexual situations for a show on cable. The language is pretty harsh as well, but the show wouldn't be as effective without it. My advice to anyone who starts watching this show, don't give up after the first episode. The second episode will clear up some questions you'll have about it and then there's no stopping there! This is one of the best shows on TV today. The originality, writing, and acting are all A++. I can't wait for season 2!",1330732800,124,1643,4.607508532423208

If you don't like dark movies about the paranormal, then you're not going to like this...but for the rest of us, it was a treat!",1330646400,4,940,4.2824858757062145

Yes I will admit I lost sleep watching this series, I can clearly point out the unoriginal ties to the old ""sex sells"", ""rosemary's baby"", frankenstein, psychos, walking dead, living ghosts, GORE that has been filling our horror movie screens for years and years.  Although this series has some good acting and is engaging, it still lacks that ORIGINALITY which is why I couldn't rate it any higher than I did.  That and paying $2 an episode sucks cuz I'm a cheapskate I guess.  Gotta give it up for Jessica Lange; she can really freaking act! So I admit, I do want to see season 2 but I am really hoping it won't be quite as random or quick moving as this last episode of season 1.",1330387200,,851,4.6092715231788075
4828911,4,B005LAJ1PE,"With ""Nip/Tuck"" Ryan Murphy created a television show that supposedly revolved around the lives of two prominent plastic surgeons. The show, however, more often seemed more like a psycho-sexual horror story than it did a medical drama. So it was only logical that, for his next show on F/X (let's not even bring ""Glee"" into this conversation, alright?) he would just completely abandon storytelling based on any sort of conventional reality and create a show that exists within the loose, unpredictable, and often absurd genre of horror.

The first season of ""American Horror Story"" involves a family of three (Psychiatrist/Father/Adulterer Ben, Wife/Mother/Woman-Scorned Vivien, and Daughter/Teenager/Depressive Violet) as they try to make a fresh start in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, they're not aware that the beautiful and suspiciously underpriced house they bought has a history of various murders, suicides, and other brutality, and is haunted by not just one ghost, but a smorgasbord of the living dead (some malevolent, some benign).

Although Ben, Vivien, and Violet are the show's supposed main characters, the most important and powerful character on the show is really the house itself. It's made clear throughout the season that the house is its own entity; drawing people to it, driving them to madness, and then containing them once they're dead. (One of the few ""rules"" of the show is that anyone who dies on the house's property is doomed to haunt it forever.) Over the years the house had claimed many victims, so the show each week often introduces the viewer to a new character, usually from a distant past, whose tragic fate involves haunting what the neighborhood refers to as ""the Murder House."" Some of the macabre characters who haunt the house include the historical Black Dahlia, a Columbine-esque teenage mass murderer, a modern gay couple, a severely deformed young man, and a housekeeper who appears as a matronly old woman when living women see her and as a naughty temptress when men see her.

Every episode of the show is completely over-the-top, filled with all kinds of outrageous plot twists meant to shock, titillate, provoke, and crack up the audience. The show doesn't rely on slow, deliberate character development, subtlety, or nuance. In terms of quality, it's a long way from ""The Sopranos"" or ""Mad Men."" What it is: a loud, freaky, kinky, fun and addictive affair. Although for such a campy show, it does include a lot of prestigious talent: Jessica Lange (who won a Golden Globe for her scenery-chewing turn), Dennis O'Hare, Francis Conroy, and Zachary Quinto all add considerable acting chops to the whole deliciously decadent show.",1329264000,58,2678,5.1658986175115205

4828914,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This series is so different and much more compelling than any other horror-themed television show that I've ever seen. If you like Walking Dead (which I LOVE), it's like the haunted house version of that show because every single episode is so suspenseful and has so much going on that you can't wait to see the next. Every episode is like watching a mini-movie in the sense that each one is completely intriguing, suspenseful, full of story line and such quality visual effects that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Of course it takes a few episodes to get going and start piecing things together but even from the very first episode it is very creepy, gives you chills, piques your interest and leaves you hungry to see what happens next!

We don't actually have cable so we would have to wait for each episode to come up online after it aired that night. It got to the point where it was almost like an event at our house where every week we would get together with friends to watch it.

****One thing though, you really have to start from the beginning  to understand everything that is going on. It would be hard to watch an episode here and there and still be able to know why things are happening the way that they are.

When Supernatural came out I was really excited b/c the effects/creepiness seemed like it was pretty cool but when I watched a few episodes it seemed like it was like watching a glorified Buffy The Vampire type/Teen TV show that I didn't like at all.

I am normally cheap about buying DVD's and like to get the not-too-much-worn-used versions on Amazon and things like that, but this is one of those series that I'm willing to pre-order and pay more than full price to have right away!

4828918,4,B005LAJ1PE,"I gotta say, American Horror Story was an interesting show with an original concept. I like horror movies, shows, and stories, and AHS kept me watching week after week. It's definitely a series to start at the begining, and try not to miss any episodes so you are not left in the dark. I can't say every episode was a homerun, but they were all well above average considering our reality littered tv landscape nowadays. The entire concept is not meant to go season after season, so be prepared for this storyline to be finished and a new cast and location is supposed to start season 2. I thought the actors/actresses all did fine jobs, with a few standout performances (Lange and Peters in particular). The show does end with some questions, but it reminds me more of short stories that leave enough of a thread open so that the reader can think of their own ideal way for the story to wrap up. The writers did a great job of answering most questions, and the series ends solidly enough that I wasn't left feeling cheated. I don't know that I would buy the whole season (not sure how many multiple viewings it would get), but it is at the very least worth renting and watching.",1327363200,3,1178,4.458333333333333

It is definitely disturbing, and I would not recommend letting children watch it. It is provocative and would probably give couples watching it something to talk about afterward.
From a literary perspective, the show is fascinating. After all, it is a horror show that is set in America or is it story that is horrifying in terms of American cultural values? I'd say it is both. Many of themes directly attack the things that are the most cherished in conventional society: fidelity, the family, and convention. The horrorific episodes echo our psychological horrors - fear of betrayal, fear of the alien, fear of the changeling, which is perhaps a metaphor for fear of our own children or fear of unwittingly supporting another's child.",1327104000,,893,4.805194805194805

4828946,5,B005LAJ1PE,"I love any well-made horror movie or series, and love American Horror Story (Season One just ended). It is a well-made, layered horror story centering on a dysfunctional family - Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott), Vivien Harmon (Connie Britten), and teen daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga, wonder is she is related to Vera Farmiga?). Ben is a psychiatrist who is in the doghouse because Vivien discovered him having an affair with his student. Vivien is also suffering mental anguish over her recent miscarriage. The couple try to put things right by moving from Boston to LA, where they buy a restored Gothic mansion. Daughter Violet is a taciturn teen who resents her parents for putting her through this, and has a hard time at her new school.

Little does the Harmon family realize that their home is horribly haunted. Yes, 'horribly' because it is not merely one or two otherworldly entities that inhabit this house, but a whole plethora of lost, unhappy, wandering souls that are somehow trapped within the confines of the malevolent house. The Harmon's next-door neighbor Constance (played to wicked perfection by Jessica Lange, in an award-worthy performance) appears to think she has the right to come and go as she pleases, which annoys Vivien no end, yet Constance also seems to know the true nature of the house. Then there's the mysterious housekeeper who talks herself into a position with the Harmons, and depending on one's point of view, can appear as a sexy, young nymphomaniac or a disfigured middle-aged housekeeper! There is nudity and sex scenes in this show, as well as graphic violence.

As the episodes progress, viewers will be kept at the edge of their seats trying to figure out which character is really alive, and which character is merely a ghost. The other interesting aspect is working out the motives of the various entities. There are many supernatural entities in this show, and it could have been a real mess trying to make everything flow and connect. Fortunately, the writers and producers of this show have done a remarkable job of connecting everything together in a credible way (well, to the extent that this is possible in a supernatural-themed show).

There are a lot of flashbacks to the past to show the history of the various occupants of the house, which is really important in helping viewers place the characters and their stories, and how the Harmons tie in with all of this.

The story is creepy but the chills come more from watching the Harmon family slowly but surely crumble as a family unit, and of how their lives are irrevocably changed as a result of living in the house. The house is the main star of the show, it is like a huge forcefield that attracts and imprisons its occupants, with the trapped souls not ever having a chance at escaping. Having watched the season finale, I can't help but wonder how the producers are going to keep the storyline fresh and interesting, as the house becomes even more cluttered with trapped souls.

4828951,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Any show which casts Jessica Lange is right away doing something right.  She becomes yet another of the very best film actors to make the transition to the small screen.  Even better, she is not playing some goody two shoes in this ghost filled series.  No, she lives next door to the Murder House in Los Angeles, in which an amazing amount of ghosts have taken up residence over the decades after a botched experience of trying to live in the house while still living. Charlotte (Lange) is tied to this house and all of the ghosts in it although we only discover this in layers and not even entirely in this first season.

The first season involves yet another family taking up residence in the house, a husband, wife and teen daughter.  The husband is a psychiatrist who practices from home.  He is so clueless that he can't tell the difference if his new patient is a ghost or not! This was one of the more humorous aspects to the series. Charlotte becomes very involved in their lives as does a housekeeper ghost, played by Frances Conroy of SIX FEET UNDER.

There are still some rough edges to the show.  It can't quite make up its mind on which characters to emphasize but is getting a handle on that aspect as each episode unfolds.  At first one is just overwhelmed with characters, both living and dead.

Now I am a huge fan of David Lynch's 1977 classic ""Eraser Head,"" a truly disturbed film. ""Eraser Head"" is in black and white. ""American Horror Story"" is, in my opinion, equally disturbed in color - a great achievement. I will be the first to admit that the Halloween episodes left me wanting. Now I should say that I only saw the Pilot show at my friend's house and figured I had time to catch up with the remaining stories. Lo and behold, something went wrong with her dish and the technician had to wipe out her stored episodes. That send me scrambling. I was able to pick up with episode 4 on my own cable network and just paid Amazon $1.99 each for 2 & 3. I would have paid more. I am now up to date. Except for the Halloween episodes, every other episode smacks you upside the head, like ""Where did that come from?"" Or I didn't see that coming! Sometimes it's just ""Damn!"" The writing is just short of brilliant.

The big event we've been leading up to, of course, is the birth of the twins and especially the one who is born of a spirit and non-spirit. So now we have that baby and I imagine that is going to be the focus of further seasons since everyone in the house, whether ghost or not, is invested in this baby. No one is invested more than Jessica Lange's character ,which gives her even more of a role in the series.  That is good because acting wise, no one else can hold a candle to her.

4828969,3,B005LAJ1PE,"i agree with the other Amazon reviewers that the show got a bit too far off course this episode. It opened by having the ghost of Elizabeth Short, the unsolved LA murder victim from more than 50 years ago, open the episode as a ghost, walking into the house for a dental appointment.  If we could have just used her and not digressed with others as well, it would have been fine.  However, we went spinning off into many other directions as well.

The spin I liked the least is that we are going to get an anti christ baby because the wife is bringing forth the baby of a spirit. The other baby is her husband's so that baby will be normal.  Meanwhile, Jessica Lange is getting ready for the babies in a rather deranged fashioned, while also entertaining a toy boy.  This toy boy gets involved with the ghost of the young mistress as he and Lange start fighting over these babies. I cannot stand this young mistress ghost. Every time she comes on camera the show starts going downhill.  Obviously we can't just kill her off as that already took place and we've still got her. But there must be some other way of getting rid of her.",1322870400,,1131,4.3364928909952605

The show is somewhat labrynth-esque in nature. It's a maze of murder, suicide, love triangles, hauntings and posessions... which are mostly fantastic.

Some bringing in and out of the character scheme doesn't flow smoothly. It could definitley be brought less choppy, more into a smooth transition. By blocking in and out the characters in such rapid succession, it confuses the story and leads to un neccessary extras to fill the time block in.

Pull out the fluffers and get back on track and this show will be given higher ratings.",1322870400,,723,5.0588235294117645
4828971,5,B005LAJ1PE,"SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL episode.

This show is magnificent.  This episode is not.  In fact, it's an annoying disappointment.

Everyone following the series went into this episode wanting to know more about Tate and Violet-- mostly Tate.  We wanted more of the story we'd been following.  But there's almost NO Tate in this episode.  The show takes a dramatic, inexplicable, and unwelcome departure from the story line to accommodate a guest appearance.

I'm still too ticked off about the whole thing to mention the guest's name.  Her presence was unnecessary and did nothing to further the story.  The appearance reduced the show to an episode of Scooby Doo and I hated it.

There were some good parts of the show, but the precious time lost to showcasing the guest really put a bad spin on the whole thing.  Hayden was wickedly awesome (as usual).  Jessica Lange takes Constance over the top with her masterful portrayal of a tortured, desperate woman.  Really an excellent show.

Again, just a bad and frustrating episode.  Enough with the guest stars.  Give us what we want: Tate, Violet, Vivian, Ben, Constance, Addie, Moira, Luke, Larry, Nora & the Surgeon, Infantata, Hayden, Marcy, Troy, Brian and the rest of the crazies we love and can't get enough of.

However, rather than giving this the usual 5-stars, I am only giving it 3 this week. The episode was very grim. We saw two murders and subsequent dismemberment. Also, the annoying ghost/mistress occupied way too much time. Her character is very bothersome, and the actress simply lacks the power of the others.

There was a powerful moment in the show when the home security guard confronted hubby over certain suspicions. It was powerful. Best of all, hubby no longer sees the maid as a young seductress. That was almost getting old, and it unnecessarily suggested that men only want sex.

But you can tell the writers sort of lost direction in this episode when they turned to the tired and cliched ""girl on girl"" action for a thrill. Come on - you guys can do much better than that.

Also, the conclusion of the episode suggests the development of some bizarre (and also well traveled) religious plot involving the Anti-Christ. That would be unfortunate.

So for these shortcoming, I gave this episode a 3 instead of a 5. I still love the show, however.",1322784000,,1187,4.660287081339713

4828974,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This is by far my favorite new show of 2011. In fact, it is one of my favorite shows period. The first episode confused me and will probably strike most people as flat out weird, but after the initial shock, you realize with each passing episode just how unique and compelling this show is.

American Horror story follows a family of three as they move into a new home called ""Murder House"" by the locals. Since the 1920's, people have been murdered in various ways and their spirits have stayed behind, trapped in the very place they died. In this case, the ghosts from all eras can take physical form as well as vanish in an instant. You slowly learn about the past of each spirit, which adds another element of depth.

The writing is always clever, twisted and surprising. I wouldn't call AHS scary (at least to me), but the music and visuals make for one of the creepiest viewing experiences I've ever had.

The cast is perfect in every way. You won't find much better acting on the big or small screen. Jessica Lange deserves a nomination of some sort come next year. There are also a bunch of guest stars from other popular movies and TV shows.

A little warning about the content. This FX show is really rough for a non-premium station. They push the sex, language and violence further than I thought they would be allowed to. It doesn't bother me, but this may cause some people to tune out. Not the majority it seems because it has already been picked up for a second season and it is most watched debut show ever on FX.

Time flies watching American Horror Story. It is the only show I can think of that ends way before you expect it to. I always hit the info button thinking I've watched half of the show tops and it reads 58 minutes. It gets me every time.

4828976,5,B005LAJ1PE,"This episode pulled the carpet out from under my feet. I've been a fan of this show since day one, perhaps even before day one, when FX announced that the Pilot was being greenlit. If you've watched the other episodes (and you must, in order, there's no question) you will find that unlike most of the hyped shows we've been seeing this Fall 2011 season, AHS continues to up the bar.  When the writers answer a question that's been lingering for four episodes or so, you'd think that it would be a let down because once that mystery is solved, what is left for us to ponder?  You'd be wrong in thinking that about this show.  When one question is answered it seems two more even more compelling questions are asked.

I will say that watching this show on my Kindle Fire is fantastic.  The image quality is very good, and re-watching the episodes as things get more and more complicated is definitely paying off.  The episodes are convenient and make a great pass-time when I'm on a lunch break or killing time (befitting the title Murder House, eh?).  Highly recommended show, it's already been picked up for a second season, so there's no worry in becoming addicted (as you will be) and then having the show end abruptly.  Maybe not sure to keep you up at night, but definitely a show to give you a new perspective on the oft-cliche horror genre.  Ghosts are people too, after all!",1322438400,,1382,4.518072289156627

4828986,1,B005LAJ1PE,"Maybe I'm in the minority here who finds ""American Horror Story"" absolutely repulsive or else I'm the only one who's willing to write about it. I have been shocked lately at what I've seen appear on the FX channel. I'm convinced this channel prides itself on being the most tasteless & morally bankrupt of all cable channels. At best this show is borderline pornographic with elements of ""torture porn,"" a concept that has experienced a resurgence of popularity lately.

Maybe I am a tad on the prudish side but I think this show is just trying to capitalize on shock tactics by taking everything taboo to such extremes that it makes me feel downright embarrassed to watch it. TV shows should entertain me not make me cringe. Every element is depicted so graphically that there is no room left to use one's imagination. When it comes to being scared by a movie or tv show, many times what is left to the viewer's imagination becomes scarier than what is actually depicted. Here everything is graphically displayed in over-the-top images that leave one feeling disturbed, disgusted, dejected.

I cannot think of a show that places more emphasis on sex (a perverted distorted kind) in combination with intense violent images including S & M tones and topped off with some language, though the language is the least of the problems. I truly think the creators/writers/producers of this show are merely relying on shocking the audience to keep its members tuned in.

I wish this show would focus on scaring us instead of shocking us. There is a big difference between terrifying/ horrifying and plain old shocking. If this show's primary goal is to provide a way for the audience to feel frightened, then it overshoots is mark and instead repels and repulses rather than draws us in by being seductively thrilling. We aren't just taunted here, we are bludgeoned. This is a shame because the premise is so great- the setting of a haunted mansion with all kinds of ghosts and forces of darkness provides a limitless source of thrills, chills and spills. Don't get me wrong here- I love a good scare. But all those things are graphically exploited ad nauseum. It's almost a gore-fest. Even the title/opening sequence is a sick bloodfest similar to the ""True Blood"" opener (and that's nothing to be proud of.)

I have never thought it enjoyable to watch graphic sex and, besides the stereotype in slasher flicks to have casual sex run rampant within, there really is no need to contain so much here. I have always thought watching two people have sex is like watching someone take a huge crap. (It seems so voyeuristic- (sp?) I mean do most people make it a point to sit and watch their friends or family members engaging in sexual intercourse? Does it become acceptable if it's on a tv show?) I'm not sure what part sex plays in chilling scare-you-to-death movies other than, as I said above, it seems to be a key ingredient without which no slasher flick is complete. Okay, if it must be in there then fine, but does it have to turn into a huge pork-fest where people are humping each other's brains out?

Even worse is the combination of the borderline porn and the vulgar gore. Seeing a man get a chimney poker shoved up his rectum by a leather-and-chain-clad figure is totally sick. This show is obviously going for the gross-out and leaving no bases uncovered. I think it must be a contest on the FX channel to see which show can morally offend the most people. ""Sons of Anarchy"" and ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" as well as ""Anger Management"" and even at times ""The League"" (though I admit that one does make me laugh at times, once I've endured all the masturbation jokes and the actual masturbation scenes) all seem to be in contention for who can be the most morally bankrupt.

Anyway, this show could have been cool but overdoes it with its wretched excess that's in-your-face and over-the-top. I wish creators would subscribe to the belief that subtle is better and less is more. Let our minds be stimulated to imagine the rest...",1322092800,19,4040,4.715297450424929

The whole cast is good, don't get me wrong, but seriously, every scene Constance has is dead on. The whole Pretty Girl sequence here is stellar.

I kinda like that the ghosts hanging around have independence of a sort. Seems like they're anchored to the house and occasionally have orders or at least a compulsion they can't deviate from but outside of that they're free to enforce their own mischief. I've seen Halloween Part 2 and it's good, but Part 1 is better. I think they just wanted an excuse to carry the Halloween theme over two episodes.

The mad doctor flashbacks as Tate tells the abortions story were creepy as all hell, too. Just that little flash of paw sewn to tiny forearm was enough to make me pause and rewatch. Same with the sudden view of the latex man during Vivien's little rage attack. Very well placed, well timed, and all around well done episode. Zachary Quinto and partner were an excellent choice as the ""fluffers.""

I was wondering as I watched, does the house pick people it wants to enslave and then have them killed, or does it too have a compulsion?

4828990,5,B005LAJ1PE,"Excellent show, in-depth characters and I already loved watching Frances Conroy from her playing Ruth in Six Feet Under.  She's remarkable.  Jessica Lange is wonderful as Constance...so utterly rude, snide, and creepy.  Love to watch her perform but I would really hate to have the real Constance as my neighbor!  Has anyone else noticed the funny little tid-bits in this show?  One or two episode's back, Tate spelled out his name for Violet, but he spelled T-A-I-N-T.  In this episode, did anyone else notice that the two skeletons were humping on the pumpin the front yard?  Too fun to find the ""funnies"" that the producers are apparently hiding here and there.  And yes, each episode keeps wanting more.  Can't say enough about what a great series this is!",1321574400,,760,4.875
4828991,4,B005LAJ1PE,"This episode further challenges my early doubts about this series. The comedy-cum-tragedy tone no longer seems forced or hackneyed and the performances by the (quite large) cast are largely to credit for keeping the high-fantasy grounded. A certain pair of performances stands out most in this episode as being better-than-average: those by Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge as Moira the housekeeper. These actors have obviously agreed on Moira's mannerisms, vocal phrasing and emotive range and managed to remain consistent in their performances. It makes Moira's ""glamour"" trick mysteriously natural. On a final note - I'd have the same difficulty as Connie Britton's character ""Vivien"" choosing between Dylan McDermott and Morris Chestnut in my sexual fantasies. I can, however, definitely do without the man in the nylon gimp fetish wear.",1321574400,2,850,5.596899224806202

I was worried at first thinking they would try to shock us with sex and nudity and not horror.  It just ruins the ""edge of the seat"" feeling when you see some man's naked rear walking downstairs.  But they have done a great job with the show.  It's an emotional roller coaster, and the acting and directing are perfect.  If you like the genre, you should enjoy the show.",1321401600,,495,4.212765957446808
4828993,3,B005LAJ1PE,"After the first two episodes, the word ""SOULMATE"" haunted me. This show felt MADE for me! But it went downhill with the Halloween episodes and hasn't recovered. Ghosts riding in cars, meeting at Starbucks and constantly dry-humping teens is a little too much for me. It lost its sweet subtlety.

I also don't like the Columbine parallels. This is not the right platform to tell that story even a little bit. One of the teenage ghosts quotes one of the murderers asking a victim, ""Do you believe in God?"" - not cool. To make it worse, when the flashback appears of Tate killing everyone the writers forgot to include that line when he kills the girl. Ugh. Bad on several levels.

Jessica Lange deserves an award for her role though - AMAZING!!! I really want this show to be good and maybe it'll improve by the second season. Right now it's filled with way too many implausibilities - even for a ghost story.",1321315200,30,907,4.558282208588957

Somewhat disgusted that they chose to glamorize a Columbine-style incident in one of the episodes, though.  Even so far as to have the student gunman ask a victim, ""Do you believe in God""?  C'mon, there's a poor taste line that should not be crossed, guys.  This crosses the line.

It's like a train wreck, you want to turn away, but you have to watch.  Anyway, this episode sealed it for me.  I am hooked now and I have to know what will happen next.  In this episode we get to learn more about Tate's crime and how he died.  It confirmed for me what I knew from the beginning that he was definately a ghost.  Tate scares me, but I find him to be the most interesting character in the show.  He is a whole lot of f'd up and I think we have only scratched the surface of what he is capable of.  I love his relationship with Violet.  It's disturbing, but also darkly romantic.  You have a deeply depressed suicidal girl in love with a psychotic murderous ghost.  It's weird but it works and I am dying to find out what will happen next for these two.  Also, I was proud of Vivian in this episode.  She finally gave that nasty adulterous husband the boot.  Ben is definiately losing it.  Vivian is becoming hot for the security guy, so we'll see how long it is before Rubber Man kills him.  I don't think he wants anyone near his baby mama.  Lastly, of course, we have the incredible talented Jessica Lange as Constance.  She tries to help Violet deal with what Tate is and hopes for her to help him cross over.  Also, there was a very touching scene between Constance and her Medium, Billie, where she told Addy how she really felt about her.  In closing, it was a great episode.

4829010,5,B005LAJ1PE,"""American Horror Story"" is indeed a series, with an overarching storyline.  Interestingly, though, is that each episode is entertaining enough to stand on its own and doesn't necessarily need to be seen in the context of what may have preceded it.

Nevertheless, try to watch the series in order, from Episode One and on.  If you enjoy getting the creeps, this show does that without your even realizing it.  First you're watching a rather blah family living in a house that has a bad history.  You meet the neighbors and the husband's psych patients.  Yes, they're weird, but you'd expect that from a TV show with the word ""horror"" in its title.

Ah, good.  You've let your guard down.  Now the fun begins.

You're in the right frame of mind to soon be asking yourself, ""What the heck was that I just saw?""  And ""That didn't just happen, did it?""

When the final credits roll, on each episode, you'll say, ""Oh, wow, that was creepy.""

All the performers in the series are top-notch, from the leads to the incidental characters.  The wow factor about the cast is that one of the most talented and elusive actresses of our generation, Jessica Lange, is part of the troupe.  She plays one of the creepy neighbors.

In many ways, the show feels like an experience in experimental theater.  Without warning, we will be treated to a bizarre segment that seems to have no connection to the storyline.  The scenes are bizarre, but provocative and interesting to watch.  But unlike experimental theater where drawing meaning and connections is solely up to the individual in the audience, the seemingly out-of-place vignettes in ""American Horror Story"" will make sense as the story continues to unfold.  Part of the show's creepiness is not knowing right away what certain things mean.  Tension builds when we feel we're on the brink of a revelation.

This show is suited just fine for the more squeamish horror fan.  This is not a gratuitous gore fest.  One pretty girl suffers a severely deep gash in her face.  But the chills and thrills are not derived from seeing her bloody cheek; it's figuring out how the wound got there in the first place.",1320192000,,2140,4.718918918918919

Think of the double suicide in Romeo and Juliet. You see, in my review of the episode preceding this one, I accused the storytellers of exposing too much of the supernatural too early. With this episode, however, I see that the narrative tension within this series works because the audience knows quite a lot of information and not in spite of that fact that it does. This has also allowed for more subtle foreshadowing in the final scenes of this episode than has been seen in big-secret shows like ""The X-Files"". Also, the mood and tone of each scene are close to perfect, allowing me, with each episode, to buy into all the ghosts and monsters and to develop real interest in all of the characters and their [after]lives.

4829025,4,B005LAJ1PE,"Co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk invoke the opposite emotion of their mega-hit Glee with their new project American Horror Story, which airs on FX on Wednesday nights. They recruit Mrs. Coach, er, Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights) and Dylan McDermott (The Practice) to play Vivien and Ben Harmon, a couple troubled by a miscarriage and a scandalous affair. They relocate to Los Angeles, where they take residence in a haunted house and become embroiled in the mysteries surrounding the property. Six Feet Under's  Frances Conroy greets them when they arrive--filling the role of ghoulish housekeeper--a harbinger of death for the characters, but an omen of good things to come for an audience who craves well-made television. Jessica Lange makes her first mainstay TV appearance as the creepy Constance.

The title sequence is inventive and unsettling, setting an eerie tone for the series that is upheld by the shudder-inducing score. The only comfort is Tami Taylor's, er, Britton's soothing voice. The show is structured in a way that employs fragmentation to yield a dizzying and delirious sensation. The use of strobe lights and quick shutter effects are terrifying because they remind us that, as an audience, we aren't in control.

The most artistically successful aspect of the series is the parallels it draws between the mundane horrors of American life and the thrilling ghostly horrors that characterize its genre--a thematic knockout and a rare feat for a show's first time in the ring. The horrors of daily life it illustrates are McDermott's interactions as a psychiatrist with troubled youth, his daughter's navigation of high school's murky waters, and his dissolving marriage.

For those that don't scare easily, the pilot doesn't necessarily succeed in the fright department. Perhaps Murphy, Falchuk and company are holding off on the real horror until they reel in an audience. They wouldn't want to scare viewers away, after all. We're also waiting impatiently for the arrival of recently outed Zachary Quinto (Heroes), who will undoubtedly bring his sinister Sylar sneer to the table. For now, American Horror Story offers up a houseful of compelling mysteries, weird sex, and disturbing imagery galore. Just in time for Halloween, this is one story we want to hear.

4829027,3,B005LAJ1PE,"The first two episodes seem to make a promise that the stories are going to get more complex, more mysterious and more deeply into the melodramatic, Gothic tone of the music and the narrative sound effects. By the end of the third episode, the show proves over-the-top and implausible. McDermott, while easy on the eyes and a talented TV actor, doesn't really sell his role as a pressed-upon and possibly psychotic psychiatrist. Most of the unbelievable quality of his performance and the performances of ALL the other actors can be blamed on the newness of the relationships between each actor and her/his character. Some of this unbelievable quality may come from the rapid-fire exposition of some of the supernatural elements of the show and of one of the Doctor's clearly psychotic acts.

The acting is terrific, especially Jessica Lange and the girl who plays Violet, the daughter. I also think that the house itself is a great character and has so many secrets to explore over the upcoming episodes.

It is a true haunted house story, but doesn't give everything away. It is scary without being overly gory, a little strange and out there, and has great potential to fill the shoes left when Nip/Tuck ended its run on FX. I was mesmerized the whole time watching it, and some of the visuals and scenes are original and terrifying and I know already to expect the unexpected while watching this show. One of my new favorites!",1318636800,4,735,4.526315789473684
4829030,5,B005LAJ1PE,This show is truly horrific! I love the star studded cast and the story is truly amazing. The reaction of the actors to the situations they are put into are very realistic. Cannot get enough of it!!!,1318464000,8,199,4.405405405405405
4829031,5,B005LAJ1PE,What a Great show.....well written. spooky and scary all at the sametime...Jessica Lange is real good too.  I can't wait to see next week's show,1318464000,2,144,4.76
8477929,1,B005LAJ1PE,"I was rather enjoying the first 15 minutes of episode 1 season 1. Then, they show this good-looking teen male, telling a psychiatrist about his recurring dream. What's it about? Oh, SCHOOL SHOOTING! He even says how he feels no remorse because he is getting them out of this cesspool of a world. YES, I realize this is from 6 or 7 years ago. BUT, school shootings easily predate that. Columbine was in the 90's. Moreover, this is the very kind of show that would appeal to youth.

Amazing that those who scream loudest for weapons seizure put out something this heinous. And do not even ATTEMPT to tell me kids aren't influenced by such as this. Before Columbine, how many school shootings were there? measure that against what was being offered on tv for the first 40 years of its existence!",1528070400,,792,4.577464788732394
8477930,1,B005LAJ1PE,"This could have been interesting to watch, but 30 minutes in we encountered too much profanity. The use of the Lords name in vane is not acceptable to my family.",1527984000,,161,4.4
8477931,5,B005LAJ1PE,Never watched American Horror Story until about 2 weeks ago. I was bored and saw it was on amazon prime. Im hooked now lol Im only on season 5 which is ok so far. Lady Gaga is actually a pretty good actor. But my favorite are season 1 & 3 so far.,1527206400,,246,3.75
8477932,4,B005LAJ1PE,Great Show.  Got me hooked from the 1st time I watched it.,1526947200,,58,3.8333333333333335
8477933,2,B005LAJ1PE,Horrible. Too convoluted and silly. Basically just one murder after another with no plot. Barely made out of season 1. Then season 2 starts the murdering all over just a different location,1526688000,,188,4.90625
8477934,5,B005LAJ1PE,Well done. I'm glad I bought this! Genuinely creepy and fun to watch.,1520985600,,69,4.384615384615385
8477935,2,B005LAJ1PE,"A very interesting show, and the show itself was great, but disk 2 kept freezing and skipping which was disappointing. No marks or scratches on the disk, put it in right after I first opened the tv show. First disk worked fine.",1520208000,,227,4.428571428571429
8477936,5,B005LAJ1PE,One of my favorite series.  It's creepy but not creepy. Enough to hold your interest and keep you guessing till the end,1519171200,,119,4.409090909090909
8477937,5,B005LAJ1PE,This show is awesome.  I like how each season is a different story.,1518480000,,67,4.153846153846154
