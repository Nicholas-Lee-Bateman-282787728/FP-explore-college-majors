2235314,3,B0007R4TKI,"Great soundtrack, adorable lead. Fairy tale story based on actual events--a little bit of a stretch to believe that all but one member of the student body supported Marc's cause.  What was with the father's character? He was made to appear ""retarded."" The DVD extras include a documentary of the real Marc and this event.  For excellent, solid ""coming-of-age/coming-out flicks don't miss ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Get Real"".",1116547200,,421,5.268656716417911
2235315,4,B0007R4TKI,"This is an enjoyable movie, actually a true story, about a gay teen who wants to bring his male partner to his senior prom.  He runs up against the expected shock and outrage from the local bluenoses.  No subtleties here.  The characters are clearly divided into the good guys and the bad guys.  A good cast of competent actors; a glossy production and cinematography help to overcome the occasionally heavy-handed and predictable plot.  It's a well-done movie and it's definitely worth seeing.",1116288000,,494,4.975609756097561
2235336,5,B0007R4TKI,"We would recomend this movie to all this movie hits home and things like this are still going on today around the world. It takes you in to some ones life and tell you the extremes you have to go threw just to have some kind of equality,been there done it in my life,now married legaly to my partner. This movie also shows that the church and state should be seperated,because of the diffrent beleifs between the both,it's like oil and water doesnot mix. We give this movie two thumbs up,watch it you will enjoy it,afterall maybe it could help you to move on. The times you think you may have friends and you think you can count on them when times are tough that is when you find out your true friend so donnot be fooled and again enjoy this movie we did.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prom-Queen/dp/B0007R4TKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prom Queen</a>",1257033600,,891,5.027027027027027
2235337,5,B0007R4TKI,I love this movie.  It is quite a change from your typical gay movie.  It has heart and a great story of love and equality among all people.  I highly recommend this movie.,1235952000,,172,4.151515151515151
2235338,4,B0007R4TKI,"This movie spotlights the intolerance we have for each other in order to ""follow the rules.""  No matter what we believe is fair and right, the rules must be followed.  It does fictionalize some portions in order to make a better movie, which must be understood going in.  I appreciated the extras that pulled away some of those layers so that we could see the differences.",1229385600,,372,4.606060606060606
2235339,4,B0007R4TKI,"For those fans of Smallville, this movie should be a treat as Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore) plays the main role as Marc Hall. Based on a true story of a senior Catholic high school student in a small town (Oshawa) in the province of Ontario (south of Toronto), Canada, it depicts a confrontation between law and religion.

Marc is a highly intelligent kid in a Catholic high school, he is gay.
Marc has a boyfriend Jason (Mac Fyfe) who he wants to take to the prom. The principal and the board of directors of the school are totally opposed basing their argument on the Church's position on homosexuality. Marc's friends at school are all out to help him so that he can take Jason to the prom. From the collection of eye candy kids, the movie moves along proving the strong family relation between Marc and his accepting parents, the Canadian Union representative at Marc's father local factory who backs him up all the way, the sleazy lawyer who helps taking the case to court and get a moment of fame himself.

The movie is lite even though of the very controversial subject. Marc wins his case but not before he realizes that in his selfish act he forgets about other people's feelings. The movie is obviously a very strong political statement about gay rights, but, the ending proves that sometimes we win if we fight for what we believe in. Marc loose his chance for a scholarship through the school but is backed by a Canadian Union and receives a scholarship through them, making that the fight was worthwhile. Oh yes, he does take Jason to the prom.

This is a great movie for high school gay teens, showing them not to give up in their beliefs. In a couple scenes there is the religious undertone of Marc being chosen for this purpose. All the actors are very cute, a tradition kept in movies. There is a short documentary in the special features showing the real Marc ,his boyfriend, and school friends. They look more ordinary. The actors are probably all Canadian, and the soundtrack is good, again mostly Canadian artists.",1211587200,,2033,4.610497237569061

2235341,4,B0007R4TKI,"A touching film about that battles the hierarchy of the Cathcolic Church and homosexuality.  Based on a true story (I very much enjoy films based on fact), following the plight of a young Private School teenagers' quest to take his boyfriend to the prom.  In taking his case public against the school (and Catholic church), and eventually to the courts, the young Marc Hall risks alienating friends, teachers, his family and the very partner he hopes to escort to his High School Prom.

All the actors in the film are excellent in their roles.  It's a shame movies like this are not picked up by the major networks like ABC, NBC and CBS.  This is a film about human rights, Catholic Church injustice, and believing in yourself and who you are as a person.  The writing is outstanding, and while many scenes are dramatic and touching, there is ample humor to keep the movie light.  The ending is uplifting, and gives us all hope that one day no one shall be persecuted for being themselves.

The movie hails from Canada, and while I would love to give this film 5 stars, it could be mistaken for an ABC Afterschool Special, Made-for-TV movie or an episode of DeGrassi Junior High (an excellent program in and of itself).  A MUST SEE for a family, or anyone dealing with a youth coming to terms with their sexuality.  When are we going to see films like this make mainstream TV?  Thank goodness for cable channels like LOGO.",1136851200,8,1422,4.5810276679841895
2235342,3,B0007R4TKI,The story is good and the acting is ok for a made for tv movie. The edit is pretty bad and at some times looks like a high school project. An overall good movie with some really bad points.,1123804800,,189,3.871794871794872
2235343,4,B0007R4TKI,"PROM QUEEN succeeds not only because it is a controversial subject based on a true incident, but also because of the light touch director John L'Ecuyer adds to the dimension of storytelling.  Writers Michael MacLennan and  Kent Staines have pieced together the facts from a now famous 'hearing' in Ontario concerning one teenage boy's challenging the Catholic Church school policies about sexual preferences in preventing him from attending a highschool Prom and have fleshed out the characters to make the story not only meaningfully important but also entertaining.

Marc Hall (Aaron Ashmore) is a fun-loving, blue-haired gay lad who has a partner Jason (Mac Fyfe) and is comfortable in a semi-closeted way, and who attends a Catholic highschool in Quebec.  He is fortunate to have a band of accepting and supporting friends like Beau (eye candy actor Trevor Blumas) and Carly (Tamara Hope) among others who encourage Marc to bring his boyfriend to the upcoming Prom. The school officials - principal and school board - are adamant that the Catholic Church regards same sex relationships as sin and refuse to allow Marc to consider attending the Prom with Jason.

Marc decides to 'come out' to his parents Emily (Marie Tifo) and Audy (Jean Pierre Bergeron) and they warmly assure him they have known for years (""Your hair. It's blue. And you have a poster of Celine Dion on your wall. We know."") With the support of his friends and a gay lawyer Lonnie Winn (Scott Thompson), Marc agrees to challenge the school/church stance and in a touching courtroom drama Marc pleads his case.  Though due to the familiarity of the case the audience knows from the beginning that Marc Hall won his right to attend the Prom with Jason, it is in the telling that the story takes flight.

Though 'made for TV' budgetary constraints and format are obvious, PROM QUEEN boasts some fine actors and manages to bring to the screen another important hallmark in the Human Rights field.  While some may avoid this film for fear of its being a 'gay movie', rest assured that the content is handled in a touching and realistic way.  Recommended for all audiences, especially the teens who need to see both sides of a  bit of history.  Grady Harp, July 05",1121904000,8,2231,4.860158311345646
2235344,4,B0007R4TKI,"Don't be fooled by this campy title. John L'Ecuyer's ""Prom Queen"" is a necessary and heart-warming tale of the charming high school student Marc (Aaron Ashmore) taking on the Canadian Supreme Court, a homophobic school environment, and the Catholic

Church in order to bring his boyfriend to prom. Even though some parts, particularly the ending, seem a bit too picture-perfect, don't worry: this film is totally believable and the plot and script remain solid and interesting throughout. Not to

mention the actors are absolutely adorable and talented.

Sexy and humorous, political and educational, Prom Queen should be required viewing in every high school.",1121817600,7,660,5.388349514563107
2235345,4,B0007R4TKI,"Prom Queen is an entertaining and enjoyable fluff piece. Based on the true story of Marc Hall, a gay Canadian student who challenged the Catholic Church when they refused to let him take his boyfriend to the high school prom, this is a loveable and cute comedy with heart. The film conveyed an important message and remained engrossing, but was hurt by the fact that it was a Made-For-TV movie in Canada. The film seemed too short and choppy. None of the characters were fleshed out and subplots appeared and disappeared like crazy. I watched the 17-minute 'documentary' about the real Marc Hall and longed for what this movie could have been. Had this been longer and more fleshed out, it would have been a much stronger piece and not the fluff it is now. This is certainly a feel-good story that will inspire many gay teens, but it had the chance to be something great and it felt short, for no other reason than the fact that it was a TV Movie. As is, this is a fast-paced, well-made gay film, with a terrific soundtrack. It just could have been so much more!!!",1120262400,5,1064,4.489690721649485

8050748,4,B0007R4TKI,"A fun after-school movie with serious religion vs. gay rights issues presented and challenged in a high school setting.  Film time spent on the process and its inherent conflict gets a bit heavy handed for the predictable outcome.  But here the major treat is seeing Smallville's and Syfy's Warehouse 13, Aaron Ashmore as out teen, Mark with his delightful first full-feature performance.  Talented and eye-candy twink Aaron (Mark) is supported by a talented ensemble of co-stars.  The disappointment of the movie spends little time, if any affectionate interaction or intimacy with his boarish, older boyfriend.  One would think they were just best friends if it wasn't for the dialogue, all the while the camera spends a lot of cutaway time drooling over Mark's gorgeous and straight best friend from high school...Go figure.  An overall sweet, feel-good flick.",1416096000,2,863,5.262773722627737
8050749,2,B0007R4TKI,"One wonders where the line was drawn between 'based on a true story' and 'Afterschool Special' in this production. There were MULTIPLE arguments, lines of logic, and even 'Christian Fact' that were ignored by *all* parties... or at least were not presented in this movie. I do not just write that off as ""it was made in canada"" there are several great TV shows & movies made in canada... but perhaps the difference is that this was made BY canada, or at least endorsed by Govt standards etc.

It seemed to me, something that ""important"" to the main character(s)... it didn't seem like they fought very hard. Perhaps that's the ''Afterschool"" treatment aspect. Even as a christian I could make better arguments on the pro-homosexual side's behalf that was made for them, the concept of ""Free Will"" was NEVER used or even uttered  /shrug",1409097600,,835,4.791666666666667
8050750,4,B0007R4TKI,"""Prom queen"" is a story of a canadian gay teen, who wanted to bring his boyfriend to the prom party.
The events, which the film is based on, became quite popular even here in Europe a few years ago. It's good to see that there are countries (like Canada for example) where reason is more important than bigotery and narrow-mindedness.
My overall impression is very positive. Both Aaron Ashmore (as Marc) and Marc Fyfe (as Jason) created a believable couple of young gays. The way his parents supported Marc and his action is really amazing and should give hope to all viewers. It's clear that you don't need proferssor's degree, lot of money or live in a big city to be open-minded and reasonable man.
The rest of the cast don't disappoint, even if some plots seem to be wooden (to name one: with those two nerds, internet freeks).",1343347200,,831,4.583892617449664
