8289808,5,B001CUB8LM,Great run through of basic western history. Fun to own and binge watch!,1474329600,,71,4.538461538461538
8289809,1,B001CUB8LM,"Labeling vigilantes' use of a windmill as a hanging platform as ""technology"" is a real stretch.  Similarly, ear cropping and branding to clearly ID robbers, use of a bullwhip to punish others, and a mountain howitzer to blow down a wanted man's cabin.  Sorry - there really isn't any technology involved here - just raw justice, and sometimes abuse of justice.",1226102400,,360,4.885245901639344
8289810,4,B001CUB8LM,"The gun clearly was the most important piece of Wild West technology.  ""The Gunslingers"" takes viewers through a review of each major gun development, illustrating its use in an important fight.

The first product illustrated was the ball and cap pistol, favored by Abilene, KS Marshall Wild Bill Hickok, who reloaded it every day because evening moisture and coolness could shrink the powder, causing a misfire.  Unfortunately, immediately after a face-to-face gunfight (rare - usually shootings were by surprise), Hickok heard footsteps behind him, and turned and fired - killing his own deputy en route to help.  Hickok lost his job, and was killed five years later in Deadwood, S.D.

Repeating firearms were a major advance, with the Colt pistol and Henry rifle, using self-contained cartridges offering major improvements in offense.  The DVD illustrates the advantage of repeating weapons in two conflicts with Indians.

Holsters also evolved, though their role in Western towns was somewhat limited because carrying guns was illegal in most locales.  (Violation of this ordinance led to the famous OK Corral shootout in Tombstone.)

Any discussion of gunslingers would be incomplete without reference to former ace marksmen.  John Wesley Hardin, son of a preacher, practiced regularly and killed his 40th man on his 21st birthday.  In one gunfight he killed his opponent with a shot through the heart at 75 yards.  Jailed for 17 years in El Paso, he studied law, then became an attorney - only to be shot in the back of the head.

While pistols were easier to use, rifles were more accurate at a distance.  The Northfield, MN. attempted bank robbery by Jesse James and Cole Younger's gang was foiled by alerted townspeople attacking with rifles from a distance that made pistols relatively ineffective.

""The Gunslingers"" final vignette briefly covers the introduction of shotguns, and Billy the Kid's use of one in his 1881 jailbreak from a Lincoln, N.M. jail.",1221955200,,1968,5.16403785488959
8289811,2,B001CUB8LM,"This slow-moving and largely uninteresting DVD is fittingly narrated by low-key David Carradine.  The first topics covered are reports of UFO sightings in the late 19th century American West (some possibly due to marsh gases or ball lightning), and various ""hails"" of frogs, unknown fish, pebbles (theorized as due to waterspouts or tornadoes).

Then its a story of a 9-year-old boy buried alive (possibly a narcolepsy victim; fortunately he was not embalmed - arsenic was used at the time) and then dug up the next morning after his mother had terrifying nightmares after the burial.  (An inventor then developed a chest-movement sensor that would open an air path and raise a small flag, if appropriate.)

The origin of the term ""thunderbird"" is a mythical large bird thought by natives to cause thunder when it flapped its wings.

Next comes a number of ""Sasquatch"" creature sightings that probably owe at least part of their oddity to repeated retelling and likely modification.

Overall, ""The Unexplained"" is slow-moving and boring.",1221868800,2,1037,5.179640718562874
