8206354,3,B000SQJ2D2,"Presumably anyone reading this is in the market to buy, and my comments are aimed at those who do not already own a copy of this opera. My advice? Buy the Metropolitan Opera's production with Marilyn Horne. This should be your second or even third choice. Under no circumstances could I give this more than a 3.5 rating.

At only 21, Maxim Miranov as Lindoro is cute as a button with a sweet, underpowered tenor, most noticeable when he sings with more developed voices. Christianne Stotun is credible, but can't hold a candle to the power and skills of Marilyn Horne's rich mezzo and indomitable personality, She appears to be more Lindoro's older sister, not lover. Giorgio Caroduro is a young Taddeo, adding to the mirth in trying to pass as Isabella's uncle. Marco Vinco is good enough as Mustaf, a role that doesn't call for much either in singing or acting.

The best that can be said about the unit set is that it is functional, appearing to have been constructed on a low budget. The shirtless eunuchs and pirates may add some visual appeal, as does Lindoro's slave costume, but that's a small consideration in view of what is after about music and performance. The orchestra and conducting inevitably suffer by comparison to the Met's orchestra under James Levine. This DVD should definitely not be a consideration for first time buyers of this silly but wonderful confection.",1356307200,6,1385,4.7907949790794975
8206355,3,B000SQJ2D2,"The producer of this 2006 version of Rossini's comic opera from the Rossini Festival in Pesaro couldn't decide whether he was staging an opera, a ballet, or a puppet show.  So he combined all three, much to the detriment of the music, which was often drowned out by the scuffling, squeaking, and creaking of the stage business.

The opera opens rather nautically.  Fish, seagulls, and fishermen sport among waves along with ladies in bathing suits.  The scene changes over to the Bey's palace where we are treated to a reprise of the seagulls and ladies in bathing suits.  Some eunuchs with streamers show up, looking like Pillsbury doughboys.  The Bey's wife and her favorite slave appear in a large swinging bed, along with twenty doughboys and a contingent of women, who creep back and forth across the stage, belly-up.  Clump.  Clump.  Squeak.  Squeak.  The two ladies have to sing over the stage noise.

The Bey appears, rolling about the stage in a large metal phallus (yes, I get it).  He and his wife sing at each other while scooting back and forth across the stage.  At least the doughboys are getting lots of exercise.

Maxim Mironov sings a sweet-toned, good-looking Lindoro, who has to compete with a fake gorilla, a lion, giraffe, ostrich, camel, and a guy with a whip during his first solo, ""Languir per una bella.""  I wondered if he really should have been singing ""Wie Stark ist"" from 'Die Zauberflte.'

The animals hang around for Lindoro's buffo duet with Mustaf, while the doughboys build a woman out of vegetables in the background.  The vegetable woman dances, rides the camel, and generally steals the scene from the two singers.

Isabella's ship arrives, is captured and looted while the stage noise rises to a crescendo.  Marianna Pizzolato sings a credible Isabella, although her voice lacks the flexibility of a true Rossinian singer.  Two dancers accompanied her with a dumb show in two of her big solos:  ""Cruda sorte!"" and ""Per lui che adoro"" possibly to take attention away from her singing.

Taddeo (Neapolitan baritone, Bruno de Simone) possessed a voice that cut right through the stage business, and for his efforts he received the loudest applause from the audience.

Italian bass, Marco Vinco was a haughty Mustaf, who actually sang the role, but not as well as he did at the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence, which was held a month before this Pesaro production (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-L-Italiana-in-Algeri-DVD-Video/dp/B0015KGJDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rossini: L'Italiana in Algeri [DVD Video</a>]).  He and Maxim Mironov, who also repeated Lindoro at both festivals, had a busy July and August, 2006.

What did I like about this Italian Girl?  The English subtitles were well done.  The vegetable woman was quite clever, and I really liked the camel.",1332633600,5,2844,5.177631578947368
8206356,5,B000SQJ2D2,"This live 2006 performance of Rossini's comic opera from the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence had a youthful, exuberant cast, whose voices were a good blend.  If I had to choose a standout, it would be Maxim Mironov's Lindoro.  He has a clear, sweet tenor with a fast vibrato and physically, he was a perfect fit for this role.  Dutch mezzo, Christianne Stotijn was also in fine voice although her main expression seemed to be a smirk.  Her first aria, ""Cruda sorte! Amor Tiranno!"" was effortlessly sung even though she was surrounded by hands-on pirates.  However there was no real contrast between the beginning of the aria, when she's supposed to be down in the dumps, and the latter part, where she is asserting her dominance over the pawing pirates.

Taddeo (Giorgio Caoduro) possessed a voice that cut right through the sometimes overly-loud orchestration.  For a change, he was a youthful ciscebo--looking in fact, like a young Gioacchino Rossini.

Italian bass, Marco Vinco was an appealing Mustaf, who actually sang the role rather well.  He performed his share of clowning and mugging with a sort of nave enthusiasm that I found quite endearing.  He did all of his threatening and blustering from the top of the three-story lighthouse-shaped structure that served as the production's only backdrop/prop, but no one seemed really frightened of him.

The eunuchs, sung by the Arnold Schnberg choir had obviously been trained by the Monty Python Department of Funny Walks.  They waddled about the lighthouse-structure, looking impossibly cute with their bare chests and little Santa Claus hats.

Two of the minor roles--Elvira, sung by soprano Elisaveta Martirosyan, and Haly, sung by baritone Ruben Drole--were minor gems, both well-characterized and vocally spirited.  I especially liked Haly's delivery of ""Le femmine d'Italia"" (that tired old chestnut which was NOT composed by Rossini), where he dashes down into the audience and directs his aria to various individuals.

The camera work was off-kilter, sometimes focusing on a character who wasn't even singing.  The person behind the camera seemed to be especially fond of Zulma.  We got to watch the conductor of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Riccardo Frizza through the whole of the overture, and at times beyond.  It was a wonderful lesson in musical dynamics.

The English subtitles were at times clunky, but they also delivered up some fresh interpretations, e.g. Isabella's taunt directed at Taddeo, ""Better a Turk than a jerk.""",1332288000,7,2492,5.200501253132832
8206357,1,B000SQJ2D2,"Really now!  This DVD is so bad that it sits on my shelf collecting so much dust that I'd be better off putting in the trash! Yes, Maxim Mironov is truly a wonderful singer, but the soprano is really hard to watch. Her singing and gesturing are too strained and overstated.  The stage is over crowded and cluttered with much too much nonsense. It's looks like a kid show run ""amok."" I'm only sorry that I waited too long or otherwise it would have been returned.  I know these comments probably will not be printed but that's ok.  I say the ""truth shall set you free.""",1283904000,2,568,4.330188679245283
8206358,4,B000SQJ2D2,"This is not the funniest L'Italiana you can get, but it is quite well-sung and everyone looks good.  The staging is a little busy and the Isabella does seem to take things very seriously.  You don't get the idea she is having any fun with the role; however, she is a good singer, with a beautiful, rich voice and she looks good.  The tenor is wonderful.  On the first aria, he seems a little rushed and his voice seems a bit cold and tentative.  As he warms up, he really gets going with wonderful coloratura in the style of Juan Diego Florez.  He has the same bleating-style voice - a little more nasal, with dead-on, accurate coloratura.  He's really fun to listen to.  He too does not seem to be having a great time, though.  Marco Vinco, as Mustafa, comes across as a bit of a comedian, and his voice is wonderful and his coloratura quite enjoyable.  Also, the Taddeo has a light, pleasant baritone and is reasonably funny.  And the lesser characters are all good singers too.  I do think if the Isabella is not funny, no amount of good acting from the other characters will make the show truly funny.  Still, the singing is just lovely on this disc, and I have played it often as an audio recording and likely will many more times to come.",1275004800,,1244,4.379912663755459
8206359,3,B000SQJ2D2,"This turned out to be a very disappointing L,Italiana considering that it comes from Pesaro. My first gripe is with Dario Fo,the director, who allegedly has  some reputation in Europe. He is content to fill the stage with supernumeraries, excess baggage and special effects that simply don't work. In short he doesn't trust his singers. Not content with the opera proper, all this nonsense starts during the overture. Rossini wrote a brilliant overture and needs no additional help.

The lighting is kept quite dim, keeping the audience from the kind of physical contact that involves the audience. Vinco who is an excellent Mustapha wears a turban of such immense proportion that it casts shadow on his face, not to mention how is the damn thing kept in place! Miranov, the Lindoro, is a young Russian who can give Juan Diego a run for his money. Both Vinco and Miranov appear to better advantage in the newest Girl from Aix where simplicity rules the day.

And the girl, Isabella? She lacks the fire of Doris Sofel, the ""glam"" of Larimore and the fire of Horne. She can sing the music, and agility is not given short schrift. But the whole effect is so dispiriting that even the addition of a tenor aria, usually cut, makes no effect. The opera which usually flies by seems very long. Surely Pesaro can do better.",1241827200,2,1315,4.708695652173913
8206360,5,B000SQJ2D2,"Whe this edition was released I already had three Girls in my collection, the Schwetzinger with Doris Soffel, the Paris with Jennifer Laramore, and an edition from Pesaro. With the exception of the Lindoro (a young Russian tenor who appears in the Glyndebourne Cenrentola)I was unfamiliar with the singers. When the set under consideration appeared I noted that the young Russian Maxim Mironov was again singing Lindoro and the Bey was Marco Vinco repeating his role. I dithered about buying this set; it is inordinately expensive and could a United Nations cast do a better job?

Fortunately the most recent Opera News reviewed it quite favorably and truth to tell I was less than enchanted with the Pesaro set. I took the plunge and having four Italian Girls may be two too many I am very glad that I did. Perhaps this is not the time to comment on the Pesaro set, but it is unavoidable in view that these two artists are repeating their roles. In its favor the Pesaro set is all Italian (save Mironov) and this is always a plus--or at least it should be. The director is Dario Fo who, I understand, has some reputation in Europe. I would be reluctant to stake my reputation on this production; in short it is a mess.

Fo is unable to leave well enough alone; every aria, duet, concerted number is peopled with supernumeraries clutttering up the stage--and remember this is a very small house. No one is allowed to have the stage to himself without having to compete with dancers, faux animals, banners, flags, you name it and Fo has thrown it in. Whoever was in charge of making the video decided that closeups were few, most of the action taking place from a distance. Mironov was not affected vocally, but dramatically he seemed to make less effect than he should. Vinco unfortunately was saddled with absurd head gear which cast a shadow on the top half of his face so that he made little if any impact. The ""Girl"" was sung by Marianna Pizzolato. A capable singer, but indifferently costumed and lacking charisma--a muted performance. For a completist this set does include one of Lindoro's arias that is usually omitted, Concedi amor. Its inclusion (or omission) would never be a deal breaker.

The Aix performance was a revelation. Lindoro became an important part of the opera; needless to say Mironov was enchanting, a good a vocalist as he had been in the Glyndobourne DVD; he is very likely to give Juan Diego a run for his money and like JD he doesn't have a trill. Vinco was transformed. Spared having to wear the absurd headgear his face was now visible and the use of closeups revealed a wonderful comic flair and great timing. The Girl? She was sung by Christianne Stotijn. Unknown to me I googled her and it would appear that she is from the Netherlands. The voice has ""flicker"" that will irritate some although in no way does it interfer with her agility. Slightly zaftig, she is quite pretty and is a capable actress fully inhabiting the role of Isabella. The orchestra is the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, the conductor is Ricardo Frizza who keeps the action fizzing, adopting fast tempi, but the singers are up to it.

The production is the opposite of Pesaro: simplicity personified. A triangular shaped playing area that is tiered remains constant and is adapted to what is dramatically required. Singers do not have to compete with extraneous action as they do in Pesaro. Vinco is a gifted farceur who is also a superb singer, ready to take the mantle from Simone Alaimo. Lastly, the performers seemed to be having a wonderful time (perhaps they were too in Pesaro but it was not possible to tell) since this is convey with the use of closeups.

Would I sacrifice my other Italianas? Well, that would be a hypothetical. Thank God I don't and I can enjoy Doris Soffel Jennifer Larmore even if they are not surround by singers who are comparable (this would not apply to Larmore's set since she has Alaimo to play against). Pesaro for completeness, probably then to Aix for sheer verve and fun.",1237766400,16,4013,4.686524822695035
