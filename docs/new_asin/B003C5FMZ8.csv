Honestly, I think there is too much pressure on kindergarten/ elementary kids and their teachers (I'm fed up with testing and my son is only in 1st grade). However, this series does teach children in a playful way. It's all about having fun with it and enjoying it and this is definitely better than lots of the other stuff playing on tv.",1420329600,,443,4.481481481481482

it took us time to collect them, this is great opportunity to save time and money.
The best way to encourage a child to learn is to buy the words world animals just
like the ones in dvd. I highly recommend the famous Word World pull apart plush plush soft animals to go with it.
The babies and kids love them so much. You can't get them anymore at stores
but if you are lucky you can come across the set on e bay.
It is worth all the money as it helps a child to learn so fast so early so much.
It is also amazing how much they sell for even used ones so it is good investment.
