2672787,5,B000JJRYAG,"Beverly Sills: Made in America is an interesting retrospect of her international career.  Filled with interviews from her television guest spots on the Johnny Carson, Dick Cavett, Dinah Shore, and Merv Griffin shows, Beverly gives us insights into her choice of roles, her views on portraying a historical character such as Elizabeth I, and her training and background.  She also shares personal recollections of her family and of her two children-both who were born with handicaps.

Throughout, we are treated to vocal fireworks, shimmering cascading notes, and her impeccable phrasing in such roles  as Cleopatra, Manon, Lucia, Violetta, and Zerbinetta.  A particularly beautiful excerpt is her Willow Song, from The Ballad of Baby Doe.  The composer, Douglas Moore, sits nearby and he introduces the piece, saying that she was his favorite Baby Doe.

We also get to see her in performances with such guest stars as Danny Kaye, Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin, and even the Muppets !

An enjoyable program from start to finish, and a must for Beverly Sills Fans.",1164326400,30,1059,5.152046783625731

Watch her performances instead.",1222387200,,89,5.0
2672818,5,B000JJRYAG,"I originally saw a snippet of this DVD on PBS and ordered it immediately. My reason for buying it was not primarily the music, but to learn more about the life and career of Beverly Sills, and after watching it I admire her even more. We all can think of people whom we would have loved to have had a chance to meet and get to know, and she is right at the top of my list.

Beverly Sills was a true American treasure, and I think the emphasis on the ""Made In America"" portion of the title is entirely apt. Her life was a testament to not only her astonishing gifts, but the determination in which she made the most of them, and the opportunity afforded by this country to allow Bubbles Silverman from Brooklyn to triumph.

And finally, of course...what a voice!",1188345600,4,761,4.277777777777778
2672819,5,B000JJRYAG,"This DVD is such a joy to watch, as it chronicles the life and career of Beverly Sills via old tv clips, recitals, live performances, clips from the Tonight Show, her concert with Carol Burnett, and more. If you are looking for a traditional recital, though, this is not for you. My favorite scenes--Cleopatra, rehearsing in her home, TV appearances, and many more. When you hear her take the high D natural in the Willow Song, it's easy to see why Douglas Moore exclaimed after auditioning many sopranos for the role ""I have found my Baby Doe."" Great clips from Traviata, Manon, Lucia, and many other roles. Highly recommended!!",1184716800,6,629,4.779816513761468
2672820,4,B000JJRYAG,"It's almost spooky: As a long-time fan of Ms. Sills, I had borrowed and watched this DVD only about a week ago. And TODAY I find out she's been striken with lung cancer and isn't expected to survive. And it's bringing me to tears.

Back in the 1970s when boys my age idolized rock stars and professional athletes, MY idol was Beverly Sills. A coloratura soprano, Beverly Sills (or ""Bubbles"" as she was nicknamed) wasn't exactly a critical darling; from a purely technical point of view she wasn't up there with Maria Callas or Jessye Norman. But she did bring a certain populism to the stage, a warmth and enthusiasm that endeared her to audiences everywhere. I thought she was wonderful, and I even had an 8-track tape of hers that I would bravely sing along to (but only in the privacy of my old Mercury Bobcat). But doing that falsetto today, at the age of 48, simply is no longer possible, alas.

As for this DVD, it's a wonderful retrospective of her career as opera superstar: Not only performing in lush and glorious operas, but also guest starring on ""The Tonight Show"" with Johnny Carson (back when that program still had class), ""The Carol Burnett Show,"" even ""The Muppet Show."" Few people younger than 30 will even recognize the name; but for those of us who remember Beverly Sills so fondly, it is a sad time indeed. As an online friend of mine said, ""When she passes, Opera will lose far more than a singer; the Arts as a whole will loose an invaluable spokesperson.""",1183075200,14,1480,4.56015037593985
2672821,5,B000JJRYAG,"I bought this mainly because I am a ""die hard"" Bastianini fan. This disc comes with bonus tracks from ""Opera Cameo"". In this, Bastianini sings Madamigella Valery"", ""Pura siccome un angelo"", ""Di Provenza il mar, il suol""etc..

But by watching about this American soprano, I realized that also she was a wonderful singer.",1169078400,3,319,5.018867924528302
2672822,5,B000JJRYAG,"This is a wonderful collection of snip-its representing the long and fascinating career of Beverly Sills.  I found it hard to believe that many of these stretch back almost 30 years when she was at the height of her career.  You get to hear her in a number of classic roles in opera she is known for - ""Manon"", ""Julius Ceasar"", ""The Ballad of Baby Doe"", as well as enjoying her charm while guesting on numerous television shows like the Johnny Carson show, Dinah Shore show, and others.  The quality is very good, and serves as a great reminder of what a memorable and fantastic singer she was.  I'm happy to have been able to enjoy hearing her ""live"" as well as meeting her in person, and now have something to bring back some of those great memories.",1168646400,18,752,4.427536231884058
2672823,5,B000JJRYAG,"I loved this DVD a lot and I'll definitely watch it again. Even though not many of Sills' performances survive on DVD many videoclips of her art are available to be enjoyed. Here we hear Sills as the lovely lyric coloratura she was. Her silvery voice may not be everyone's cup of tea but it enthralls me every time I hear it. It's just beautifully pure and yet shockingly expressive. If you love Beverly Sills or want to discover the magic of a lyric coloratura, buy this DVD. The only drawback for me was that it's more docu than singing.

As for the former reviewer's unprofessional remarks on Maria Callas (A colleague Beverly Sills had nothing but praise for) ... I suggest you be more careful when it comes to judging people you've never met. La Callas the singer is for the audience, Maria the woman is none of our business.",1166832000,6,830,4.496688741721854
2672824,3,B000JJRYAG,"I was very disappointed.  To begin with, the title is a real turn-off.  ""Made in America.""  As though that had something to do with her wonderful voice and personality.  Callas was born here too, and she was a gorgon.  I almost didn't buy this DVD because of that.  I hate this country.  Sills sings (I didn't watch the excerpt from Traviata) only 2 arias complete, Cara nome at the age of 10, and Una voce poco fa in an enchanting performance.  Also she sings a few pop tunes complete.  It's all excerpts (SHORT ones!  VERY short!) and snippets.  It's very disappointing and unsatisfying.  I learned a lot about Sills (which I'm glad and grateful for), but I got bored with the flick.  The movie covers her life from age 3 (when she started performing) up until age 51 when she retired from singing.  I never realized how good (that's an understatement) Sills was or how much I loved her.  There's nothing stuffy or pompous about her.  She's nice and fun.  After thinking that, sigh, it dawned on me just how many (almost all that is available) CDs and DVDs of Sills I own.  If Netflix offered it (it doesn't right now anyway), I would recommend renting this DVD (to learn about Sills' fascinating life and to get a glimpse of her glorious voice and magical personality), then instead of this, buy compliations and complete operas with her in them.  I'll sigh never watch this again.  Sills, Sutherland, Pons - those are my favorites.  Though before I discovered what a monster she was, I enjoyed Callas too.  Sorry.  I like to think well of my heroes.  Oh hell.  Buy this DVD.  It's fascinating and there is SOME music in it, in bits and pieces.",1166745600,11,1647,4.535836177474403
2672825,5,B000JJRYAG,"On reflection, I wish the program had been even longer, and had gone more in depth with her professional life, collaborations with other artists, etc. Those who know Sills's life will see where the obvious ""drop outs"" were.  Nonetheless, I'm pleased the thing got made at all and it serves as a welcome calling card for many who'd no previous opportunities to (as Sills herself would say) ""see what all the fuss was about.""

It was fun to see all that gruesome almost glow-in-the-dark-by-numbers, 70's Sills Diva Fashion on the talk show circuits and some of those hair do's . . . mon Dieu! Loved also the still photos, such as the period when she was singing in the private after-hours club, looking all dark haired and sultry. Oh, Bev!

The Willow Song, the Cleopatra aria, the Manon scenes and her late career takes on Violetta and the Deveraux Elisabetta, perfectly captured the Sills commitment and excitement. Such impeccable musicianship in everything she did, wed to a formidable stage personality, it's no wonder she created so many sensational performances.

It was great getting to see clips of the talk shows I remember as a kid, and hearing her sing the popular numbers. I loved how, unlike so many who put on a show with histrionics in this type of material, Sills stood, stock still, and in ""All the things you are"" even had her hands demurely hooked into her front pockets, every bit of emotion coming purely through the voice and her smile. How special to find someone who trusts the material so much that she can sing it THAT passionately, feeling no need to add anything ""extra.""

It's always interesting to see the change of perspective coming back to a singer a decade or two after they've left the stage and studio. Sills, to my ears, was sounding threadbare and rough on many occassions, but that's because I was comparing her with herself. Critics could get harsh, for the same reasons. Now listening to some of her end-of-career material I'm actually surprised at how much voice was left when she retired.

With her love for musical theatre, I always thought Sills should make a final performance singing ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" as the Mother Abbess in a revival of The Sound of Music.  A friend of mine (who I pretty much turned on to Sills) interviewed her last year and asked her if it was true that she really never sang at all anymore.  ""not even a note to test the voice out?  Not even in the shower?""  ""Not a note,"" was her reply, along with something along the lines of ""that Beverly Sills was another person""

Unfortunately, some of her greatest successes, in the roles of Cleopatra and Baby Doe were never taped, so we have to settle for still photos and CDs. This is one of the better stories of a beloved opera singer available.  I had the chance to meet Sills once, and she was as charming and friendly as one we might have expected.

8151112,5,B000JJRYAG,"The color is fine.  The sound is clean with reasonable fidelity.  There are lots of clips of performances from various periods of her life.  The is a nice narrative with many excerpts from interviews with Ms. Sills.  I particularly liked the many ""talk show"" interviews.  They gave Ms Sills a ""human"" dimension.  The added bonus of a 1955 highlights performance of La Traviata with Ms Sills singing the role of Violetta was interesting though the sound was marginal.  This DVD is particularly poignant given the recent bankruptcy of the opera company that was such an important part of her life and career.",1383177600,,606,4.882352941176471
8151113,5,B000JJRYAG,"It was a treat to see footage of Beverly Sills as a girl soprano.  I find her so likeable as a person, and she was also a model daughter and a loyal pupil and a challenged mother who was upbeat in spite of her children's problems.  Also, in spite of her tremendous talent, she was self-deprecating in many instances.  She must have been so much fun to be around.  It's hard to understand why anyone would criticize her for ""trying so hard to be liked,"" but some people do.  What's wrong with being pleasant and wanting to be liked?",1374105600,,531,4.3232323232323235
8151114,5,B000JJRYAG,This DVD encompasses everything I wanted to hear.  Arias she sang.  Her appearance on Major Bowes Amateur Hour.  It is a very satisfying DVD.  Her personality comes across.

8151117,4,B000JJRYAG,"Not just the development of a little girl into an operatic superstar, this DVD also shows--without, I think, consciously meaning to--the development of a narcsisistic self-involved prima donna into a real human being with humility after she suffered the humbling blow of giving birth to two deaf children who would never be able to appreciate her gifts.

It also has numerous selections of her singing various operatic arias and duets, some not available elsewhere, such as the ""Willow"" solo from =The Ballad of Baby Doe,= which was particularly beautiful.
