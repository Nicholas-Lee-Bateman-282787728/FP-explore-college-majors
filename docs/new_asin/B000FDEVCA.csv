8121193,3,B000FDEVCA,An OK sequel to a much better movie with the same stars.,1487980800,,56,3.75
8121194,5,B000FDEVCA,Been looking for this for a long time.  This was great and the original and sequel are both well written.,1406764800,,105,4.25
8121195,1,B000FDEVCA,"Absolute crap.  I received a DVD-R burned version of a shoddy VHS tape.  Nobody said anything about burned DVDs in the description.  The movie was fine, but the methods under which it was made were execrable.",1406592000,,208,4.722222222222222
8121196,5,B000FDEVCA,A great movie with a sequel.  Original was 1985 and sequel was 1994.  Robert Conrad is my favorite star and I watched both when they originally aired.  His tough guy image here was exactly what was needed to offset the cool headed George Hamilton.  I recommend them highly.,1352073600,,273,4.625
8121197,1,B000FDEVCA,This movie stinks. Don't Buy it. I'll send you mine for free. Just dispose of it in an eco-friendly manner.,1236729600,2,107,4.4
8121198,3,B000FDEVCA,"Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent is the third entry in the Two Fathers series of TV movies, starring Robert Conrad and George Hamilton.  The plot line involves the two fathers pursuing an escaped prisoner who had killed their children.  This is average TV movie fare, nothing special.  The DVD print was fine.",1235520000,2,314,4.886792452830188
8121199,5,B000FDEVCA,"I ALREADY WATCHED THE MOVIE ""TWO FATHERS"" ON TELEVISION.  NOW I WILL REWATCH THIS TITLE ON DVD.  IT WAS THE GOOD MOVIE ABOUT THE TWO FATHERS WHO TRIED TO BEAT THE DRUG DEALERS.",1204848000,2,176,4.303030303030303
