8146164,2,B000ILZ6G4,"I agree 100% with Lena.  This DVD is a good instruction for street dance, but it isn't too good for a workout.  You begin the DVD with a short warm-up with music, but after you are finished MaDonna Grimes, the instructor, turns off the music and proceeds to teach you the first 8-count.  The DVD is divided into six 8-counts, and MaDonna carefully teaches you each and every move adding details and techniques to her explanation.  The problem is that she slows the 8-counts WAY down to teach them to you, and you don't get cardio benefits at all.  Eventually once she thinks that you have learned it, she turns music back on and you dance that 8-count really quickly to the music.  This elevates your heart rate, but once you've practiced the move 2-3 minutes, she turns off the music and slows down to teach you the next 8-count.  Also, there is no cool-down at the end of the DVD, which I think is a must for any workout.  You could get a cardio workout if you jogged in place while she explained, and then danced up to tempo, but you would be jogging about 70% of the time, and what fun is that?  MaDonna is very fun and friendly, and the choreography is cool and very 90s, but I felt as a workout, this DVD wasn't very good at all.",1262304000,,1235,4.288793103448276
8146165,3,B000ILZ6G4,"I love some of the newer Madonna Grimes Dance dvds. This is part of an older VHS series she had that is put on DVD. There are 4 chapter choices in this 37 min dvd.
Madonna is alone on a very dark set room. All you can see is her & the wood floor only a several feet behind her, just enough for when she has to dance back. The sound is fine & you can see her clearly. She's wearing a see-thru floral shirt w/black bra, heavy terry/cotton winter hat & very baggy olive pants. There is NO music except for the 4 min warm-up at tempo & when she goes over part of the routine you've learned which is real songs from the 90s mostly. Most of this is standing & learning steps with her mostly counting. She will show you a step 2-3x always on tempo, telling you details you might not notice like turning the head, then when practicing the routine, she just mostly counts in 8s. Madonna is a good teacher, she gives good cues, but w/o music & more practice even of part of the routine, it's mostly slow work of learning new moves only that were new probably before 2001.

There used to be a clip on collagevideo when it was offered on VHS but no longer.",1204675200,2,1144,4.107142857142857
