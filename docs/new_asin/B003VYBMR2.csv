8407199,5,B003VYBMR2,"You want this video to show not just to doulas, but to the public to let them know about doulas.",1369353600,,96,3.85
8407200,4,B003VYBMR2,"As a childbirth educator and a birth doula I'm always looking for birth dvds that I feel happy to show my clients.  This one does it, it's realistic, informative and above all - safe.  By that I mean that it's not going to scare women into going for all the interventions available but is going to give them a grounded perspective on what it's like to have a baby.  I loved it and the stories.  I was also positively surprised at how long it was and how free from ""expert"" commentary it was.  Great dvd, well done, would recommend it.",1346716800,2,534,4.3
8407201,5,B003VYBMR2,This is the DVD I've been looking for... It gives an accurate picture of the many roles of a Doula. I will recommend it to friends and clients.,1323216000,,143,4.142857142857143
8407202,4,B003VYBMR2,"I am a certified labor doula.  Like the other doula reviewer, I felt the movie didn't quite spell out what a doula does as well as other natural childbirth and educational DVDs.  Overall I recommend this DVD, more because it shows what a lovely home birth can look like than its doulas.

I wish it would have focused on facts about the benefits of having a good labor support person available to you.  The benefits of having a doula present are astounding:

(From the Doulas of North America website, DONA.org)

Numerous clinical studies have found that a doula's presence at birth

  * tends to result in shorter labors with fewer complications
  * reduces negative feelings about one's childbirth experience
  * reduces the need for pitocin (a labor-inducing drug), forceps or vacuum extraction and cesareans
  * reduces the mother's request for pain medication and/or epidurals

Research shows parents who receive support can:

  * Feel more secure and cared for
  * Are more successful in adapting to new family dynamics
  * Have greater success with breastfeeding
  * Have greater self-confidence
  * Have less postpartum depression
  * Have lower incidence of abuse",1301097600,2,1171,5.0476190476190474
8407203,4,B003VYBMR2,"I bought this thinking it might help me market my doula practice (meaning it would help me articulate what a doula does) - I feel it didn't focus enough on what a doula does but rather on the parents experience.

Though a good doula will make it feel like she wasn't even there, I still feel the editing could have allowed for more focus to be on the doula than the clients. (since the title was doula!)

I wish the last couple was placed in the middle, it seems placing them at the end could make a pregnant family dwell on possible outcomes instead of trusting in a woman's body.

I feel the title should have been birthing with a doula- since the focus is about the birth and not the doula- though the doula is talked about.

I still love the movie- it has some great scenes of birth normal birth... and will recommend it",1284940800,8,824,4.262820512820513
8407204,5,B003VYBMR2,"Excellent movie, very well edited. It does an amazing job of showing Doulas in action and how invaluable they can be.",1283817600,2,117,4.619047619047619
