The graphic showing which muscles you are working is wonderful. WOrth having in any workout collection and suitable for beginners.",1191196800,,262,4.9772727272727275
8051180,5,B0007T0MYI,"I have had a lot of workout vieos and I haven't come across one so complete in my life. A great workout that you can improve with. Some workout videos you can outgrow quickly, not this one. A great choice for any fitness level, just do what you can.",1180569600,,249,4.1020408163265305
8051181,5,B0007T0MYI,"What do I look for in a workout DVD? Clear & detailed instructions, thought-out workout routines, a challenge, and a bit of panache.  The Elite Forces: Combo Workout delivered all I had hoped... and more.  The included free ""Basics"" program set the tone for safety, teaches you how to punch and kick, and how to approach the workout for the first time. The workout itself is a combination of Pilates, cardio-kickboxing, yoga and flexibility training.  I am an experienced home workout fanatic, and can handle most any exercise DVD on the market, so I wasn't sure if this workout would be too easy for my tastes.  I was very happy to discover that while the Combo workout isn't the toughest out there, I was able to get a great workout at my fitness level by using the optional weighted punches and kicks suggested in the Basics.  I think this DVD would be perfect for anyone just beginning who wants a DVD they will enjoy from the beginning (as a beginner), and continue to enjoy as they progress to a higher level of fitness and stamina.  Even without the weights, I found that this was a great prep for my harder workouts outside my home. The ""MASS"" animations that display which muscles you are currently exercising is really cool, something right out of science fiction!  The DVD is really a great value, as it comes with a lot of extras on the disc that make it really fun.  You get 4 sexy missions (action vingettes), a load of still images from the production, and two little movies titled ""Behind the scenes"" and ""Behind the missions"".  Plus the maker really thought about how people use exercise programs at home, by allowing you to control the sound in the workout. (Ever wanted to just workout to the music only? Or no music, just vocal instruction with no distractions? You can do both of these and more.)  I'm giving this DVD workout an A+, and think it is going to be one of my favorites for a long time.",1116547200,13,1918,4.533333333333333
8051182,5,B0007T0MYI,"I have heard a lot about Elite Forces video from a friend who have been doing it for a while and loved it.  But I'm about hundred pounds heavier than she is, so I was worried that Elite Forces was going to be too tough for me.  But when the single workout ""Elite Forces: Combo"" came out I have decided to give it a chance.  This workout is just great - I've been doing it almost every day for the last three weeks and can already begin to see my body reshaping (and got few pounds off - yes!).  I was thrilled to see that the video wasn't the typical ""jumping around and kicking in all directions"".  The whole workout looks and seems relaxed even laid back at first, so it's quite easy to do, especially since you can choose your own pace, and they even have girl in the video (they have several cast members each exercising at different levels) that will show you alternate moves if you are a beginner or want to reduce the challenge.  What I love the most about this one is the MASS animation that always reminds me which muscles I'm supposed to focus on during each routine when I work out.  When I'm doing the Combo I don't feel tired or winded (which is a strong deterrant for me - if a video will get me completely out of breath it's over), but next day I feel the muscles I never knew I had!  This one is a great buy and when I get another 20 pounds off I'm definitely going to get the Elite Forces boxed set.",1116547200,10,1416,4.123636363636364
