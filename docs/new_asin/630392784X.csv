7855502,4,630392784X,"Beautiful transfer and sound. But beware, the product I recieved is not the one pictured or described. The FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT release is what I did wind up with and its the best release of this classic film. Content wise, ITS A SONNY CHIBA STREETFIGHTER FILM! How bad could it be? Its ripping good classic Chiba. Throat ripping, mind you;)",1422662400,,344,4.75
7855503,3,630392784X,"I am trying to find out if this movie is edited or not. I heard that Street Fighters Last Revenge was the only one of the trilogy that has not been released in the US uncut. I was wondering if this region 1 version is uncut or what I heard was true? In the uncut version, Chiba rips out a mans still beating heart. I bought a Street Fighter Box Set and the only movie that was edited was this one. It contained an edited version of that scene. Comment on my review if you know if there is a region 1 unedited version I can buy. I know the region 2 box set has it uncut but I am looking for a region 1.",1319500800,,601,3.816
7855504,5,630392784X,"Sonny Chiba is as funny as ever here, and his fighting scenes are great as always.  However the highlights of this film are when Chiba is cought in a hard place he decides just to kick hsi way thru the cieling and escape to another level!!!

Also Chiba in one fighing scene kicks a bad guy and he lands in a coffin and gets creamated.  The perfect 70's kung-fu movie.  Great voice overdbs, and even a beautiful kung-fu fighting girl!!!",1119571200,,435,4.4
7855505,2,630392784X,"IN THE FINAL MOVIE OF THE ''STREET FIGHTER'' SERIES, SONNY CHIBA RETURNS AS TERRY SURUGI TO PROTECT A SET OF TAPES THAT CONTAINS A FORMULA FOR MAKING HEROIN. BUT A DRUG CARTEL ALSO WANTS THOSE TAPES, AND THEY'LL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET THEM. BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER ''SISTER STREETFIGHTER'', THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS FINALE. THOUGH THERE ARE STILL GOOD FIGHTS, THE STORY IS WEAK, SONNY'S CHARACTER HAS GOTTEN SOFT, AND IT'S TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES. WELL, IN MY OPINION, SONNY CHIBA DESERVED A MUCH BETTER WAY TO GO OUT IN THE LAST MOVIE OF THE SERIES  THAT HE WILL BE REMEMBERED MOST FOR.",1058832000,,608,4.527272727272727
7855506,2,630392784X,"The third insallmenet in the Street Fighter trilogy has the best plot yet. A gang of mobsters wants a formula for synthetic hieroin. The gang double crosses Terry (big mistake), murders his girlfriend(bigger mistake) and fails to kill him(biggest mistake). So as expected Terry goes after them and gets his revenge. The gang realizes too late it is bad for one's health to ... off Terry Tsurugi. I liked the action even though I had a pretty good idea what was going to happen after they killed his girlfriend. The action was cool and brutal. I recomend this as well as the first two, Street Fighter and Return of the Street Fighter, wheather you are a fan of Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba.",1051833600,,685,4.5772357723577235
7855507,2,630392784X,"In order to take the series in a new direction, the film makers dropped the rough and tough street fighter motif in favor of some really bad 007 and ""Mission: Impossible"" stuff.
The simple plot starts when Chiba gets double crossed by some drug dealers who need two audio tapes in order to create cheap synthetic heroin. He also gets mixed up with a corrupt District Attorney, who kicks Chiba bootay thanks to an ancient Korean martial arts technique. The D.A. is also playing both sides of the fence, and Chiba and D.A. end up bedding one of the hottie girl villianesses. A final showdown between the D.A. and Chiba is good, and an explosive finale kills a major character.
Chiba dons a mask not once but THREE different times, pulling it off like a poor man's Martin Landau. He also has a secret room in his apartment, and sleeps with the villainess. All I could wonder was ""what happened to the street fighter?"" Instead, Chiba wears diguises from which his identity is discovered anyway. At one point, he has two giant suitcases of money as payment for the heroin recipe tapes. He sleeps with the villainess, who distracts him long enough for the suitcases to be stolen. Did Chiba hide the money elsewhere, knowing the villainess' plan? Did he booby trap the suitcases, knowing the henchmen would be after them? No! Now he has to get the money back again. For an international hitman, scrappy street smart karate expert, and champion of justice, he sure does some stupid things in this film. By the time the Bond-like villain shows up (a guy in a sombrero with lasers hidden up the sleeves of his bull fighting uniform) the film had lost me. A subplot involving an answering service girl who has a crush on Chiba goes nowhere.
This was the last ""Street Fighter"" entry with Chiba as the main star, but it was followed by the last film of the series: ""Sister Street Fighter."" Either way, this is by far the worst of the first three films. I cannot recommend it.
This was Japanese dubbed into English and rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, gore, some profanity, female nudity, and sexual content.",1022803200,,2122,4.661333333333333
7855508,5,630392784X,"To sum it all up, all the Street Fighter movies were excellent.  Luckily, I was able to obtain a dubbed edition letterboxed on vhs from Front Row Entertainment.  However, I wished they were all subtitled.  It would have been much, much, better!!!",1008028800,,246,4.809523809523809
7855509,3,630392784X,This is a good film. Unfortunately this version lost a lot of its original charm due to the fact that it is not wide screen and MAINLY due to bad dubbing. In the japanese version CHIBA SHINICHI (turned SONNY CHIBA)plays a  rather ferocious Tacuma TsurugiIn this version Sonny Chiba plays Terry(/)  Tsurugi who sounds like a cartoon character. There are translation  errors. For example the karate style of the DA Officer is from Okinawa not  Korea! The new format and sound do not allow you to really appreciate the  kata the DA officer performs to show Tacuma his karate style. To dub this  film may have been comercially sound. However it was very unfortunate for  the film. I believe japanese films should always be subtitled. Karate and  Samurai films often became ridiculous when dubbed. Ridiculous Not funny,935625600,3,813,4.883211678832117
