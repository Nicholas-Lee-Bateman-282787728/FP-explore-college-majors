4227992,5,B003Y8YAZQ,"This is an excellent show, I bought all the seasons. Unfortunately the DVD packaging from Canada is absolutely useless and damaging to the DVDs. The majority of the DVD sets arrived with DVDs loose and damaged. I have a machine that resurfaces the DVDs and that is what I had to do with many of them. I now have them in individual sleeves so the damage will not continue to happen. Since only season 1 has been released in the US and a compilation set was released as well, I had no choice but to order the Canadian releases. I am glad I did even though I had to do some disc restoring. If you can fix your DVDs I would recommend getting this series in its entirety.",1321056000,2,666,4.2109375
4227993,5,B003Y8YAZQ,I appreciated getting this fast.  Came in new condition and am very pleased.  I do not like the format of the boxset but that's not your fault.,1318550400,,143,4.2592592592592595
4227994,5,B003Y8YAZQ,"This DVD set is great. I would highly recommend to any sci-fi fanatic.  It stays true to its original format with creatures from outer space. There are some amazing stories in this series that really make you think, what if?? If you like or love the series from the black and white days, or twilight zone...then this is a must for you.",1303862400,3,335,4.403225806451613

8408930,1,B003Y8YAZQ,"terrible quality. this has been a big problem with amazon video when it comes to old shows. i've seen better quality of this on youtube channels than on here. its ridiculous. if you are going to make people pay for it, let them know what they're paying for. there needs to be a clear indication of the quality of the video. otherwise, people are going to buy it expecting good quality and then waste their money. please fix this",1503705600,2,428,4.430379746835443
8408931,5,B003Y8YAZQ,"Excellent updated version of a TV classic.

Relevant story lines that are as meaningful today as they were when the series came out, if not more so as both our technology and culture becomes more complex.",1485129600,,204,4.666666666666667
8408932,5,B003Y8YAZQ,The episode descriptions do NOT match the show titles. This is an still unresolved issue with all the seasons on Amazon VOD.,1483747200,,124,4.681818181818182

8408934,3,B003Y8YAZQ,"Season 7, episode 4 is wrong. It has nothing to do with the civil war, but rather alien babies or something, not what i ordered, but cant get a refund because I started watching it, only to find out it was mislabeled.",1478822400,,217,4.190476190476191
