8563775,5,B00B813SAE,"Two reviews in one; artisan ideas has excellent customer service. They stand behind their product. And Mr Sorrells is a very skilled craftsman who is good at teaching. You should buy this before you even consider sharpening your sword, or you just might ruin it. It's more than a big knife and as such it can't be treated like one. Unless you already understand this sort of thing this is pretty much a must.",1487289600,,408,4.527027027027027
