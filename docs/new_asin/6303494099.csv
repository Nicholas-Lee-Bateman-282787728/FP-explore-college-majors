One of the last studio chapterplays, ""Man with the Steel Whip"" (1954) should have been called ""Recycled Zorro."" A good cast does its best amid the glaring production flaws.

1.  Dick Simmons
Date of birth:  19 August 1913 - St. Paul, Minnesota
Date of death:  11 January 2003 - Oceanside, California

Special Footnote, Richard Simmons an American actor played a number of minor roles at varous film studios, he achieved fame in the mid-1950s when he starred in the half-hour syndicated TV series, ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" (1955) ... with his horse Rex, and his husky King, Preston brought law-and-order into the 1890s Gold Rush as a member of the Northwest Mounted Police. Each episode ended with Preston hugging his dog and saying: ""Well, King, it looks like this case is closed."" --- the trio became a mainstay on children's television from 1955 to 1958.

BIOS:
2. Roy Barcroft (aka: Howard Harold Ravenscroft)
Date of birth: 7 September 1902 - Crab Orchard, Nebraska
Date of death: 28 November 1969 - Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California

Second Special Footnote, actor Roy Barcroft one of the most sought after badmen of the Saturday Matinee era --- His face appeared in more westerns than any cowboy villain who rode the range in the '40s and '50s --- an complete account of ""Roy Barcroft:King of the Badmen"", which is the title of Bobby J. Copeland's book on the life and times of ""Republic Pictures Number One Villain"". Barcroft appeared in B-Westerns and Serials - became one of the most recognized actors, when you heard that familiar voice --- you were in for it. Roy was one of the few bad guys that once you saw his name in the credits, you were going to get your money's worth. Barcroft was my first favorite and my second was Harry Woods, who in many ways reminded me of each other --- I remember watching Barcroft in a variety of Republic Serials --- ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), as Captain Mephisto --- ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945), as the invading Martian --- ""G-Men Never Forget"" (1948), a dual role as the honest police commissioner and the lead villain (good & bad look-alikes) --- ""Don Daredevil Rides Again"" (1951) --- ""Radar Men from the Moon"" (1952), as Retik --- My favorite B-Westerns were the casting of Wild ""Bill"" Elliott and Allan ""Rocky"" Lane vs the under handed dealings of Roy Barcroft, boss, leader of the gang or henchmen --- every frame was B-Westerns at their best --- With knock-down-drag-out fight scenes that gave you everything you ever wished for and more in an action film --- fellow actors, producers and directors all agree Roy Barcroft was as beloved as anybody else in the Motion Picture business.
