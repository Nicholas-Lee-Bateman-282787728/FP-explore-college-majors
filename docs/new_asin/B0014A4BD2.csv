8254799,1,B0014A4BD2,"First let me say any information on the mysterious bee colony collapse that is spreading like a virus through our country is welcome. People only think of honey when they think of bees but they pollinate our fruit crops and if this nightmare continues without a solution it will be devastating to our farmers, beekeepers and food economy.

The true horror is that the CBS 60 minutes show took a 12 minute segment on this mystery and is selling it for $17.95.

They could have at least provided the whole 60 minute episode for the price, or added a book on beekeeping.

So please look before you buy. This is not a sixty minute DVD, but a 12 minute segment from the CBS 60 Minutes show. And at more than $1 a minute, I think you can find the same information on Amazon in the following new books:

Bees Besieged by Bill Mares
Fruitless Fall by Rowan Jacobsen
A Spring without Bees by Michael Schacker
A World Without Bees by Alison Benjamin",1247011200,12,939,4.441860465116279
