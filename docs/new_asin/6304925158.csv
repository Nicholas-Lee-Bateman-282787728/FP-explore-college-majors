939939,5,6304925158,"I fell in love with the Smokies as a child when we'd go to Virginia every summer to visit my dad's family.  I've been back to Tennessee numerous times as an adult and never tire of the beautiful scenery.  The movie dealt  with things dearest to my heart:  The Smokies, the old ways, spirituality.  I'm inspired by it, and as someone else said, I've watched the movie twice  since I rented it and plan to watch it with another loved one tomorrow.  It's the kind of movie you want to share with the people closest to you  because, like Little Tree's grandma said in the movie, when you come on  something good in life you gotta share it with someone else so the good can  just keep on going.",949708800,8,689,4.271317829457364

939942,5,6304925158,"Having experienced life as 1/4 Cherokee, and being ridiculed because my family's history is from the eastern part of Kentucky, I thought this was a fine portrayal of people and families, getting back to what should be most  important in life.

In the early nineties, I did some work for a lady and we talked often, as I worked. She loaned me this book, apparently knowing that I would like it. I read it and copies were hard to find at the time, but I managed an order of seven to share with friends. In the early 2 thousands I moved to Oregon and made some new friends.

I know the writer of the book, which was turned into a movie was a racist, but I do believe by the time he wrote the book he had seen the error of his ways and given up those racist ideas.  How else could a man write such a beautiful book? I use this film in class and the students really appreciate this great film.

940266,4,6304925158,Good story. I bought it because I couldn't find my old VHS tape (I'd recorded off TV). I showed it to my 8 y.o. son as he and his dad were preparing to go serve on an Native American reservation for a short while. I wanted him to have some history and perspective of what's happened to the Native Americans before he went. I felt this was pretty well on his level and a good story as well.,1409961600,,389,4.0
940267,5,6304925158,"I recommend Education of Little Tree to everyone. It is such a pure, unadulterated movie and story about a young part Cherokee boy in the early 1930's about.....he has to learn to be strong while still very young.  He lost his father and mother and was taken in by his grandparents who lived in the east Tennessee mountains. They taught him 'the way' which was the Cherokee Indian way of living.  So many good, practical lessons that would do a young boy good.  More kids needs to learn what Little Tree learned from real life. Wish there had been a sequel. It is based on true stories about Cherokees who escaped from the Trail of Tears walk to Oklahoma during that part of US history that brings pathetic shame.  Excellent acting and true to life portrayals. Good for anyone but children especially.",1406332800,,801,4.619718309859155

940269,5,6304925158,"While the movie is different from the actual book by the same name, the story it tells is extremely close to what actually happened to the Cherokee children. Try as they could, the invaders of this land were not able to destroy the native peoples that had been living here for hundreds of years.  My great, great, great grandmother was Cherokee. When my great, great, great grandfather died, she became heir to the land he owned in Texas.  Some people didn't think ""Indians"" should own land and how we don't know but they took it away from her. Going back even farther...selfish ""white"" people found out that the lands the Cherokee owned in the east had a lot of gold and with the help of President Jackson, they forced them off of their land and sent them on what is known as the ""Trail of Tears"" where thousands of Cherokee died as they were forced to walk to Oklahoma.  Talk about ""Crimes against humanity"" what europeans did to the natives living here is a fine example.",1402704000,5,974,4.5227272727272725
940270,5,6304925158,"My great-great-great grandmother walked the trail of tears.  I know first hand the hardships my family had to endure being Cherokee.

I love the sweet and tender interactions he has with his grandparents, and his innocence and loyalty to his family. This really provides a fair picture into what inter-race relations were probably like in this part of Tennessee during this time period. The only thing I really didn't like is how the movie seems to glorify and even encourage alcohol boot-legging. This is a great movie otherwise that is sympathetic to Native situations and inter-race relations in the U.S. during this time.",1397260800,,627,4.761467889908257

movie, but sad too, as it portrays the trail of tears of the indian and its affects on the descendants.
The movie portrays the love of the grandparents for their grandson and the sadness

I liked the way the story is told from the eyes of a child of a mixed blood marriage, sent to live with his grandparents in the mountains in a log cabin.  His grandfather is white and married to a Cherokee woman, and they share a deep love of nature and much of the ways of the Cherokee even though they are living in solitude pretty much.

Grandpa doesn't chastise the boy, he just loves him.  The movie made me miss my grandparents but more importantly, the spirituality of ""The WAY"" and ""The understanding""  (death and movement to the afterlife) really powerfully portrays Indian spirituality.  I loved that.  Its quite a contrast to the old style Indian movies where they were portrayed as savages (up until ""Dances with Wolves""). Praying to the Dog Star and having your prayer answered may seem over the top to some, but, this small boy, abused in solitary confinement by ""Christians"",is a poignant commentary on the hypocrisy of crimes made in the name of Jesus Christ.
After Little Tree is ripped off by paying a Christian Man his only money for a calf with a diseased liver, Little Tree's lesson learned: ""I'll never trade again with a man who calls hisself a Christian"".  The ""education"" of Little Tree is not all book learning, although there is some of that.  He picks up cussing from his Grandpa but is chided gently and lovingly against the habit.  Have you ever been to the mountains in Tennessee???  You can still get moonshine in the Appalachian hollers there and in North Carolina too.  Soooo, I don't view the moonshine segment of the movie that detrimentally, even for children, because its fairly historically accurate.  Children could even enjoy the scene of Little Tree escaping from the ""revenuers"" (government agents) with his dog, Blue.
Bigotry is also reflected in a little blond white girl who befriends Little Tree.  They see each other periodically and like children of that age, cement their friendship by trading/exchanging little items they treasure.  The scene of Little Tree seeing his friend for the last time before being shipped off and gifting her with a pair of moccasins made from the hide of his dead calf, is a powerful scene -  A good teaching moment for children who may be watching this movie with their parents.

940387,1,6304925158,"I caught this movie on TV this morning, had never heard of the book.

Whoa, where to start!

From the opening moments, too much exposition of who,what,where, why and when instead of peppering it out sparingly through the movie.

Everyone is a walking cliche'. I winced when Graham Greene first came on screen dressed like what Hollywood thinks an Indian should look like, he being quiet and so attuned to the ""spirits"" he could barely speak. I hated that the director chose to ""tell"" of the Trails of Tears instead of ""showing"" it to us via flashbacks. In fact I zoned out during this 5 minute disseration and never heard the end.

Little Tree is 8 years old in this story, talks with the wisdom of a 50 year old. Yuk! I HATE that! He speaks in phrases that belong in a Hallmark sympathy card.

James Cromwell did less than phone in his performance with acting so bad I was squirming. The director/writer(?) made his character spew so much exposition during the beginning of the movie I wanted to yell ""Shut up! Just SHUT UP!""

Everyone else in the movie was pure Appalachian, inbred Deliverance types. We just needed some good ol' banjo music, but we got the fiddle player instead.

The director whose name I have thankfully forgotten shamelessly stole cinematic scenes from Legends of the Fall, The Yearling (the death of grandpa vs Penny Baxter's ill with snakebite bedscene, both identically composed and lit) and probably A River Runs Through It. I don't know if this director's still making movies, but we can only pray he isn't. Truthfully I don't believe this story would have translated well to the screen, some just can't make the leap, but in the hands of Robert Redford, who is a true cinematic artist, I think he could have truly improved upon the book as he did with the exquisite Horse Whisperer.

The scene when Grandpa comes to save Little Tree at the school and stabs the knife into the ground by the gate is so heavy handed I laughed. It screamed, ""Look! This is a message! We're making a point here! And we'll make danged sure you don't miss it! ""

940407,2,6304925158,"I'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography. Otherwise, it teems mostly with clichs and stereotypes: mountain folks are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious and/or ragged racist kind, or wise white Indians. Indians are deeply spiritual, almost magical people who move silently, disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read minds over large distances. And so on and so forth.

Throughout the movie I kept wondering what the point of the film was (other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains, log cabins, woods, an assortment of animals, free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church).

The plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth. This was neither a story about growing up during the depression era, nor about life in the Apalachians; neither about about being an orphan, nor about a struggle for identity; neither about friendship (of course Little Tree's little girlfriend had to be blond and barefoot and have an abusive father), nor about relationships. It tried to be all of those things and more, and that made it superficial and unsatisfactory.

Although the movie was supposed to be about Little Tree's education, we learn almost nothing about this education. He was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; tried his hand at chopping wood (at which he failed) and whiskey running (literally); learned how to read (and maybe to write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary (bound in aardvark skin, I suppose) - and that was it. Of course he didn't learn anything during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic.

However, grandma, grandpa, and Graham Greene's character made sure that Little Tree turned into a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""riding with the Navajos"" and ""getting caught up in a couple of wars"" - was to ""catch up"" with grandma and grandpa and Graham Greene's character in heaven (instead of, say, dating girls, getting married, having children or other such nonsense).

Last but not least, I must say that I found grandpa's trade offensive. Why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still? To counteract the stereotype of the ""drunken Indian""?",1190678400,,2343,4.921518987341772
940408,3,6304925158,"I enjoyed this movie.

The acting was very good. The setting was effective and the theme appropriate.

A little boy who is part Cherokee is taken away by his full-blood grandmother and his white, but Cherokee-by-choice, grandfather. They love him with all their hearts and they teach him who he is and where he comes from. He finds love and security and happiness. They are poor, and Little Tree encounters some prejudice, but he also learns quickly that this prejudice has nothing to do with how we are inside. He learns compassion. He learns about death.

Then the authorities get in the way and carry Little Tree off to ""Indian School."" There he is institutionalized, his head is shaved and he is ""disinfected."" He is also stripped of his Indian identity, but among the other Indian kids in the school he quickly finds it again. He is vigorously punished for telling the truth about nature in class.

Then magic happens. The deus ex machina enters the movie and he is swept back into his Indian life in the hills with his loving grandparents. A better ending would have been that he overcomes the horrors of life in ""Indian School"" and grows up to be a strong man because of the awesome values his grandparents taught him, but that ending wasn't used.

This is a great movie for kids who'd like to know about this subject more. I enjoyed the great acting from everyone and the beautiful setting.",1188345600,,1398,4.6437246963562755

I actually liked the way the child got  involved in the moonshining action, showing  how it's hard to define activities as ""good"" or ""bad."" Many citizens believe the moonshine laws did more harm than good, like the war on drugs today.

I also liked the way the movie gave us an ending that was satisfying but not sugary. Bad things happen. The child was learning to differentiate between nature's cruelty and invented human cruelty.

And I don't think the whites were stereotyped as bad. The grandfather and his fellow moonshiners were a great bunch. The church scene was a little extreme but offered some much-needed comic relief.

Why four stars and not five? After watching the video, I learned the author's story, and I felt a little cheated.

I was amused to find out this weekend that one of my ancestors on my mothers side, (Mind you it's the Iroquois side not the Jewish side)Was a leader of the KKK in Columbia County, New York.
 I have always hated racism and find my self more comfortable when I am around people of other races and cultures.
 I would love to laugh at my ancestor because he had no idea that this would happen to his family. We are a damn cool family too. Some how we escaped the damnation and are a family that is dedicated to furthering the cause of love. I am not ashamed of my anscestor for that very reason. His hatred and stupidity died with him. I don't know that he murdered anyone back then but if he did, it is quite possible that this far down the line we have become relatives of those families too. That would mean that he is their anscestor as well and why should they be ashamed? This is a great story and their should be a story of the life of the author if anyone would be interested in writing it.

940466,4,6304925158,"I was required to read The Education of Little Tree in a college freshman course and became hooked immediately. I use the book and movie now in my own classroom instruction. If you are looking to buy the movie as a replacement to reading the book, don't. The movie is very different from the book by Forrest Carter. Basically the movie is geared more toward children but is still well worth watching for all ages. Buy the movie and buy the book, both are great even with the questions about Carter's past.",1070323200,5,505,4.5
940467,5,6304925158,"I loved this movie and have watched it many times. I am buying the DVD as I've worn out the video version already. Masterful, understated acting and a powerful story about learning the Way in the world.  Tantoo Cardinal (granma) at her best. Quiet, supremely confident and powerful in her presence. Quite frankly I truly believe this movie is of Oscar quality and shame on the Oscars for missing it. I really can't say enough about this movie. I don't understand how it's been overlooked by so many....  This is the kind of movie you will cherish for yourself and  find yourself handing a copy  to your child later in life...  Beautiful.

940468,5,6304925158,"this movie will go into my library and be treasured for years to come.  while it touches on the 'sensitive' issue of the persecution of Native Americans, it maintains a good connection with the 'white' sector of america as well bearing in mind little trees 'roots' (half native american half white). everyone will relate to the tender relationship between little tree and his grandparents while still getting a realistic idea of the plight of native americans in having to relinquish their children to missionaries running so-called schools, and the abuse children had to suffer at the hands of these individuals.  the balance of tenderness and reality is well-done and i found myself smiling frequently...nevertheless, a tear a two did fall, but in real life tears and smiles intermingle.  Recommend for people of all ages, and all races and ethnicities.",1023408000,12,855,5.136690647482014

It is beautifully done, entertaining & enlightening. Each time I watch it, I am amazed by the wonderful cinematography, and also moved and inspired to search my own soul and examine my own life. I only buy movies that I can watch repeatedly and still discover something new each time. This one is a movie I could never tire of seeing. It's terrific....

The author, Forrest Carter, lived this life and I think he tells the story so beautifully. If certain people are depicted in an unflattering light, it is because they lived their lives that way. It is a story for all generations to watch and enjoy.  My children, myself as well as my father, have all thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",992908800,,505,4.397849462365591
940471,5,6304925158,"The scenry was terrific.  I've live in those mountains before and this movie truly captured the spirit that dwells there.  It is very difficult to put into words.  Apparantly Dana from Sharpsburg, GA doesn't like to face the reality of our ""glorious"" American heritage of rancid and destructive white European religious arrogance and racism.  The movie really makes you wonder why did we as a people ever dismiss the native American way of life so out-of-hand.  This is a keeper.",991612800,2,479,4.9375
940472,1,6304925158,"We were so disappointed with the Education of Little Tree movie.  The Cherokee were treated sympathetically, but the whites were stereotyped as badly as native Americans have been in the past.  The language and subjects addressed made it inappropriate for children and we had to fast forward through more than one portion.  Most upsetting was the presentation of fundamentalist Christians.  The characters were so one- dimensional they were like paperdolls.  It was clear that the film makers do not understand or care to know the Scotch-Irish people.  Well, at least the scenery was breathtaking.",987379200,8,597,5.297872340425532
940473,5,6304925158,"Nineteen hundred and thirty-five was a pivotal year for the eight year old  boy called Little Tree. It was the time when his mountain grandfather and  Cherokee grandmother came to retrieve him from a relative determined to  break his spirit. These two remarkable people take their grandson into the  mountains where his real education begins. Reminising about that time, the  adult Little Tree's voice shares with us his story, his heritage and his  determination to be the person that he is regardless of the hardships which  come.
  Listen to his story as we're taken into the Smokey Mountains  of Tennesee where some Cherokees were fortunate to hide after being on the  Trail of Tears. Hear Willow John's tale of his people that he passes down  to Little Tree. In sharing the Cherokee story, Willow John insures that his  people will never die. For their story lives in their young people who will  carry it to their children.
  The scenery of the Smoky mountains is  fantastic. You get to know the mountain people during the depression. See  grandfather make the best corn whisky in the area as he tries to hide from  the revenuers. Feel the compassion that a young boy has for a little girl  only to have the prejudice of her father stand in their way.
  Learn  the painful lesson of Native American children torn from their families,  sent to a boarding school, stripped of their names and language and forced  to suffer indignities which no child should suffer. Those sordid parts of  American history makes you want to cry in sadness and anger. Little Tree is  able to endure even at his young age due to those life's experiences and  lessons taught to him from his grandparents. These lessons are not found in  a book but are read from the heart.
  This is an excellent movie that  deals with identity, loss of innocence, prejudice, poverty and bureaucratic  insensitivity. Through it all a young boy's spirit stays vibrant as ever.  Sentimentality won't be found here. Love, dignity and pride are what  endures. Take heart the lessons of Little Tree.",968544000,8,2060,4.788571428571428
940474,5,6304925158,"This movie is very powerful.  One to make you stop and think how intolerant we have been in the past. I felt that it accurately portrayed the book.  (Something that very few movies can pull off.)  It allows you to  see the ""Trail of Tears"" in a whole new perspective.  The acting  is well done, and the profound, homespun wisdom should make us all miss a  venerable, aged loved one that has passed onto their own  ""understanding.""  If you want a good heart-warming story that  will bring the tears to you and teach your children sound morals, it  doesn't get much better than this.  WATCH IT!",956016000,9,592,4.481132075471698
