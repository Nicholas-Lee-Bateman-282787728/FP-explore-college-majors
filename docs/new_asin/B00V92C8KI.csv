8709648,5,B00V92C8KI,"This is such a great DVD. I use it while riding on my exercise bike & it's a great pace for a walk or ride. The first walk takes through beautiful  fall scenery, the different colors of the changing leaves, the birds singing. Just beautiful! The second walk also takes you through beautiful, open fields. The third walk is through a beautiful, wooded area and I love all the sounds of the wildlife. The coloring is so bright & crisp. Another job well done!!!",1438387200,2,458,4.4523809523809526
8709649,5,B00V92C8KI,"Another enjoyable DVD addition to my collection of Virtual Walks. The footage is clear, stabilized, high quality HD, and in brilliant colors from the greens of the forest to the stunning autumn hues. There is three, 20 minute walks that can be individually looped or played together without interruption for a longer workout. When I feel like walking or cycling longer it is easy as these loop automatically.

 I enjoy these DVD and find them easy to use for other exercises as well. They are a great tool for enhancing my workouts. I find that the ever changing scenes encourage me to walk longer. The realistic nature sounds make it feel like I'm actually walking in the forest without leaving the air-conditioned comfort of my home or gym. I really enjoy these Virtual Walks. Always looking forward to seeing the new ""walks"" added to this collection. These are some of the best DVDs for exercising that I have found",1434758400,2,918,4.767295597484277
8709650,5,B00V92C8KI,"This DVD gives me a lovely, calm feeling as I walk through this wonderfully verdant forest.  In one section there are lovely autumnal leaves of orange and gold  both on the trees and by the side of the path  and these autumnal colours and sometimes mixed with the hues of superb evergreen trees.

In another section I find myself walking through heath land with bracken and shrubs all around me; then I see a majestic silver birch standing alone in this sunny landscape with clear blue skies above me.

The soundtrack to this program appeals to me with its slightly muted birdsong, the distinct sound of a cuckoo in the distance, and the endearing sound of a woodpecker in the centre of the woods.  This all generates a happy, summery feeling for me.  Who would think that a quiet walk in the woods could help me to enjoy my exercise so much!",1432598400,2,842,4.5
8709651,5,B00V92C8KI,"JACKPOT!!!  I feel like I hit the jackpot when I got this DVD!!  I LOVE all things NATURE and these 3 walks are more than exceptional!! If I had to pick my favorite, it would have to be Walk 1 because that's the one in Fall. The red leaves everywhere bring me peace and serenity. This is what it looks like where I live in Fall. I could watch that walk endlessly, it's so good. I have many walk DVDs and so far, this is the best one!!  The other 2 walks on the DVD are awesome too - they are filmed more in the summertime, which is why I chose Walk 1 as my favorite. But the other 2 are good, I just love Fall the most. I doubt you'd be sorry if you bought this DVD. Great job again!",1431734400,,683,3.8297872340425534
8709652,5,B00V92C8KI,"Three very different 20 min. walks:  Autumn colours, expansive open grasslands and green lush dense forest.  The pace also varies in all three walks, with Walk 2 being faster and very suitable for actual running on your treadmill or a moderately paced ride on your stationary bike. You walk/jog along dedicated paths, mostly in solitude with nature, and only see the occasional cyclist.  You can only hear birds and the sounds of the forest ... absolutely relaxing and peaceful!  For a change, I sometimes play my own music and use these Virtual Walks whilst ""walking on the spot"" in front of my TV. You can watch a trailer and also purchase/download HD digital versions of these videos from the producers' website www.worldnaturevideo.com, add them to your iPad and watch them whilst you use the treadmill at your local gym.  The HD digital versions also work very well with my Apple TV.  This company has so many great Virtual Walks and Virtual Cycle Rides DVDs and I have over the last couple of years purchased over a dozen of them.  Highly recommended!",1430265600,3,1057,4.806629834254144
8709653,5,B00V92C8KI,"The DVD In the forest is great for anyone who wants to work out in the nature with natural sounds without leaving home. The DVD shows us the National Park De Hoge Veluwe in the Netherlands with its beautiful landscape. It is great that there is a variety of seasons. It changes from summer to autumn. In summer there are beautiful green trees and in autumn, everything is red and orange. The sounds match the videos very well, you feel as if you are actually there. Video two leads you through the purple heathland. Here the speed is really fast, this is especially good for people, who want to work out on a bike. This is a great DVD with gorgeous scenery of the National Park in the Netherlands.",1429142400,,697,4.410852713178294
