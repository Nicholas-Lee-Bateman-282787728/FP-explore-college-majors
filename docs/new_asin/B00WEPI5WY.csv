7131180,5,B00WEPI5WY,"Polycarp is a great movie! The movie accurately portrays the historical setting of second century Christianity. Its message is especially relevant for this time, in which many are suffering for their faith in Christ. All Christians will be blessed by this great story. The movie is family-friendly.

7131181,5,B00WEPI5WY,"Watched this movie from a digital download at a friend's house.  I will definitely be purchasing this for my collection.  What a wonderfully moving and challenging film.  The cinematography and color grading was great.  The acting was outstanding.  Not sure what another reviewer's comment about the actor who played  Quadratus was all about.  I though he did a fine job.  I would highly recommend this movie to Christian families especially.  How many of us in the U.S. would not deny our faith publicly to escape persecution and death?  What is the other movie mentioned in the title above you ask.  ""Beyond the Mask.""  (A must see, also.)",1430870400,17,641,4.88785046728972
7131182,5,B00WEPI5WY,"ithin the past two weeks, my siblings and I got to see the Polycarp movie!
(available as DVD on May 5th 2015!)
We were interested partly because we know many of the people involved with this film project, and partly because historical accounts such as these are so important to remember.
I must admit that I experienced some fear of going to see a Christian film because I can be rather critical of the typical badly-filmed poorly acted homeschool family film.

Imagine my relief and excitement when I immediately found myself immersed in the movie, with no qualms at all about the quality of the production!
We all agreed that this film accurately and respectfully portrayed the life and death of Polycarp.
Polycarp (AD 80-167) was one of the earliest martrys. A student of the apostle John, Polycarp served as the bishop of Smyrna.  Tertullian testifies of Polycarp's discipleship with John, while Saint Jerome wrote that Polycarp was a disciple of John and that John had ordained him bishop of Smyrna. Polycarp was martyred at an advanced age for refusing to burn incense to the Roman Emperor. He was burnt at the stake and then, when the flames did not end his life speedily enough, stabbed to death. A famous quote from the martyr is:
""Eighty and six years I have served Him, and He has done me no wrong""

  How wonderful then, that Henline productions (run by talented brother and sister Joe and Jerica Henline) has produced this beautiful film dramatizing the later years of Polycarp. Although it incorporates some fictional aspects, one can tell that the film was made with much thought and consideration to historical detail and the glory of God in particular. This is no money-seeking venture but rather a film dedicated to the Lord!

Since there are so few details known about the daily life of Polycarp, Henline productions created several fictional characters, specifically a slave girl ''Anna'' around which to weave the story. The whole film beautifully emphasizes God's amazing love and grace as the family in the story actively demonstrate God's love by opening up their hearts and home to the young slave girl.
It makes a wonderful family film which will open up hearts and lead to important conversations particularly with young children. On that note, I will assure you that this movie kindly avoids gore and extreme violence. The scenes in the ampitheatre are surprisingly well-done with the horror of the moment being represented yet there is nothing you would want to hide from a child younger than 8 or 9.

Other aspects we loved about the movie include...
-Sets/props were accurate; excellent portrayal of ancient Smyrna (our family loves history and are used to critiquing films)
-Believer's worship gatherings were realistic and well done (you know how awkward it is when you're watching a film about believers in ancient times and they use terms from the 21st century? Not so in this film, thankfully!)
-Gary Nation who played Polycarp did a great job!
-Eliya Hurt, although not a professional actress played her main role of ''Anna'' delightfully
-The score by Benjamin Botkin was absolutely beautiful. I loved how he incorporated traditional instruments into the music to give it a perfect Greek feel.
-The horror of the amphitheater was hinted at without there being any gore whatsoever
-I recommend this movie for ages 8+
-The cinematography of this film was especially pleasing. Beautiful color tones and filming.

As for those necessary critical thoughts which I'm sure you want to hear since there is no way this movie can be absolutely perfect...
-We didn't care for the actor (Gary Bosek) who played the evil Quadratus...but he was a bad guy, and nobody's supposed to like them right? We just found his acting talent lacking.
-There are some amateur actors of course, but not unbearable.

In conclusion, your family can't go wrong with getting this movie and watching it together! You will be moved and blessed by it.",1430265600,36,3954,4.9338345864661655

7131185,5,B00WEPI5WY,Good movie to inspire. I was concerned that it was going to be 'corny' or kid oriented but i was quite relieved to find out that it was way better than i was expecting. It was beautiful. And its also appropriate for a child to watch aswell (pg13). I really enjoyed this movie,1519603200,,275,4.2075471698113205
7131186,5,B00WEPI5WY,"Excellent movie, so grateful for this production. There's so many great movies of faith just begging to be made!",1519430400,,112,4.947368421052632
7131187,3,B00WEPI5WY,"I rejoice that many are being awakened to the blessings of knowing about the lives of the saints. I feel this movie falls short in some important respects, though. To be a martyr is to be a witness, and learning about the lives of the saints is a powerful way for Christians to prepare for martyrdom. Although this movie focuses on Christian love, showing the Christians engaging in many acts of charity, it misses the opportunity to focus on evidence in support of Christianity above and beyond statements about how ""God loves us"" and ""God created us."" Why were the early Christians willing and, indeed, happy to give up their lives in witness to God? Because they knew that Jesus Christ defeated death and was resurrected on the third day and ascended into heaven. They knew, because the eyewitnesses to these events were willing martyrs who had nothing to gain on this earth by preaching the gospel and willingly accepting martyrdom. Jesus worked miracles during his earthly ministry to provide easily understood evidence of his divinity. Was it all done in love? Yes! But there is more than ""God is love"" to Christianity, and as the fictional slave girl/adopted daughter Anna struggles with whether to believe in any god at all or with the God of the Christians in particular, the movie fails to have any of the Christians around her offer her evidence in support of Christianity beyond showing her love and explaining that God created us and that he has a name for each star and knows her name also. I also feel like the Church is missing from this movie, although some gatherings and some preaching are shown. I noticed no reference to baptism or communion, although the historical record is clear that these were central to Christianity and practiced at the time. In short, this movie is commendable in that it depicts some actual Christian saints willingly going to their martyrdom firm in their knowledge of and love for God, but it misses the mark in how it depicts both the Church at Smyrna, of which St. Polycarp was the bishop, and the full content of the gospel, which goes far beyond presenting a vague ""loving creator"" and proclaims how the very particular God-man Jesus Christ entered into history, performed particular miracles as signs for people, and was crucified and resurrected and ascended, all for the salvation of mankind. Glory to God for all things, forgive me a sinner, and St. Polycarp, pray for us all.",1519344000,6,2433,4.795238095238095

7131189,3,B00WEPI5WY,"Too preachy. In this day and age to still think the force of Unconditional Love and Omnipotent Wisdom has a penis is ridiculous.  An invisible old man floating in the sky smacks of Odin, Zeus and Santa Claus. Love the history of the Christians; just can't take the literal male description of God.

7131194,5,B00WEPI5WY,"This is the story of Polycarp, an early Christian. It is a story of life and faith of early believers and what their faith in Christ cost them. The acting was very good. We enjoyed this movie as a family.",1518566400,,204,4.125
7131195,5,B00WEPI5WY,"Was nicely done and encouraging... displayed love of true Christians well I think.
My kids were concerned about what was happening and it was a good example to show them courage in God and not to fear the enemy (who are behind the enemies who we are to love and hope for their salvation also. My youngest boy only 3 years old loves Polycarp played by the man he sees in this film Gary Nation because I believe he can see love displayed in him that is so longed for by children and anyone who longs for peace deep down. (Most of the acting was very well done and sets were nicely done too.) This is my only keeper and favorite movie because of its encouragement in Christ. I am getting rid of all else that is really of phony Christianity today.
Ephessians 6:10-18,
""10Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 11Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 14Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 15And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 17And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
18Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;""

7131204,5,B00WEPI5WY,"Our kids' assessment:  ""It was awesome!""  We have been studying church history up through the Reformation, and this movie was a great addition to our studies.  There is artistic license, of course, since not that many details are known about Polycarp, but overall, the movie sticks to what is known and what is likely to have happened.  Polycarp and Germanicus are our kids' new heroes!
We'd love to see more movies like this one that help bring history to life and which inspire us in our walk with Christ.",1511481600,,507,4.662921348314606
7131205,5,B00WEPI5WY,"It's a very good movie about Polycarp, a disciple of the Apostle John.

My family and I loved it and were blessed by the faith, courage and boldness of these saints.",1511136000,,347,4.4375
7131206,5,B00WEPI5WY,"My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie. The CGI is mediocre and slightly disorienting, but its use is rare and this is obviously not an effects heavy production. The story follows a young girl named Anna as she goes from pagan slave to servant of Christ. Most of the movie takes place while she is living with a group of Christians, through whom she was set free. The setting is in Smyrna, under the rule of Rome, with Christian persecution mounting. The three main characters - Polycarp, Anna, and Germanicus - each have their own unique struggles and compelling character arc. The faith of each is put to the test as they make decisions, face consequences, learn, grow, suffer, and love. The man who plays Polycarp - an actual historical person who studied under the Apostle John - especially did a great job, with the young girl playing Anna close behind in performance. Other actors ranged from lackluster to solid, and while some of this can be distracting, it doesn't take away from the overall experience.

Thank God for men like Polycarp and others like him throughout history, who boldly stand for Christ and preserve his holy Word. This is a family friendly, Christian movie - no foul language, sexuality, or extreme violence that I remember. It offers a good look into that time of history and what Christians faced. We found it encouraging and edifying. I recommend it.",1510876800,,1381,4.754166666666666

The acting and action were too subdued at times, but I'm guessing the producers didn't want to make it so intense that it wouldn't make a good ""family movie.""  So I took a star off for that, since I would have preferred more realism, but if you have little kids you might disagree.  However, on the whole it was well done.  I liked how the movie showed that early Christians helped orphans, widows, the poor, and slaves, whenever they could.

7131237,5,B00WEPI5WY,"This is a well-acted and well-scripted dramatization of the teachings of the theologian, Polycarp. Polycarp is considered one of the great ""Fathers of the Catholic Church"". Much of his writings and teachings were influenced by the Apostle, St. John. But, all is based on the Gospel and teachings of Jesus Christ. The performances were magnificent from all involved. We are transported back in time to the persecution of the Christians by the Romans after the death and resurrection of Jesus and how lives and hearts are transformed by the spread of the Gospel. The words spoken by ""Polycarp"" in the movie resonated with the Christians strengthening their faith and courage letting them know that God's grace is with them in times of suffering. The film moves along a bit slowly at times but contains much peril, suspense, and action to keep the viewer intrigued and engaged. As the Bible mentions when we suffer, we share in the sufferings of Jesus and should give glory to God for it for he is with us throughout. Polycarp knew this. ""When Christians suffer, they should not be ashamed but glorify God because of the name.""- 1 Peter, Chapter 5. I highly recommend this movie.",1495929600,4,1176,4.855721393034826

7131248,5,B00WEPI5WY,"Polycarp was a disciple of John, and preached the true Gospel according to godliness Amen!!!

Quoting The Repentance of Early Christianity

This is the purging of men's minds, that whatever defilement habitual error had imparted, whatever contamination in the heart of man ignorance had engendered, that repentance should sweep and scrape away, and cast out of doors, and thus prepare the home of the heart, by making it clean, for the Holy Spirit, who was about to indwell, that He might with pleasure introduce Himself there-into  A.D. 160

The Original Saints believed and taught that you MUST come clean with God in Repentance BEFORE the Holy Spirit would indwell. No one was 'Saved in sin or did any early Saint teach that man was Born in Sin. They understood that man possessed free and unhindered ability to Obey God and DO what was Right. Most of professing Christianity today is under a massive System of Error that has negated genuine repentance and substituted it with a wretched man profession that keeps them in slavery to their sin.",1489881600,4,1046,4.892655367231638
7131249,4,B00WEPI5WY,"I thought this was a great film. Not much is known about Polycarp, besides his martyrdom, except that he was a disciple of the Apostle John and a friend of Saint Ignatius (Bishop) of Antioch, who wrote one of his seven letters, on his way to Rome to be martyred himself, to the Church of Smyrna, where Polycarp was Bishop. We also have ""A Letter on the Martyrdom of Saint Polycarp by the Church of Smyrna"" which is believed to be authentic from eyewitnesses that tells us that, ""Even before his martyrdom he had received every mark of honor in tribute to his holiness of life.""

I believe that beginning with something like this assumption, the writers and directors came up with a fictional, but a very good and plausible story during this time of Christian persecution, very much worth watching, to present the life of Polycarp to us which would lead up to his famous martyrdom. I gave this only four stars because I think the producers did not go far enough in recreating the actual martyrdom scene. The above letter tells us an important fact that was left out, and which has always stayed in my mind since first reading it decades ago, ""When they tried to fasten him also with nails, he said: 'Leave me as I am. The one who gives me strength to endure the fire will also give me strength to stay quite still on the pyre, even without the precaution of your nails.' So they did not fix him to the pyre with nails but only fastened him instead. Bound as he was, with hands behind his back, he stood like a mighty ram, chosen out for sacrifice from a great flock, a worthy victim made ready to be offered to God.""

However, the most important omission, which I think in some way could have been re-created with today's special effects is as follows: We are told that after the above exchange, Polycarp prayed after which, ""The officials at the pyre lit it. But, when a great flame burst out, those of us privileged to see it witnessed a strange and wonderful thing. Indeed, we have been spared in order to tell the story to others. Like a ships sail swelling in the wind, the flame became as it were a dome encircling the martyrs body. Surrounded by the fire, his body was like bread that is baked, or gold and silver white-hot in a furnace, not like flesh that has been burnt. So sweet a fragrance came to us that it was like that of burning incense or some other costly and sweet-smelling gum."" Without this being re-created, I was left wanting and I think understandably so. I have read this account each year for decades on his Feast Day, February 23rd.

This being said, I also watched the bonus feature, quite long and informative, on how the movie was created. It was extremely fascinating seeing the staff, the producers, writers, actors and actresses, and the ""on scene"" set builders work together very excitingly on this project of theirs and recreate such beautiful backgrounds used to shoot this film.",1489536000,49,2915,4.527514231499051

7131268,2,B00WEPI5WY,"I give the folks who produced this movie--a small, hometown effort akin to Sherwood Pictures in the early days, with a 20-year old girl for a screenwriter and producer--full credit for producing a movie that has surprisingly good production values.  But this is the ONLY reason I gave it two stars instead of one.

Here we have a movie about one of the early church fathers--a disciple of the Apostle John himself--and he's portrayed as no more than a mush-mouthed charismatic preacher, his message reduced to the profundity of the children's ditty ""Yes, Jesus loves me.""  Really?  With all this work, that was all they had to tell us about him?  What an absolute waste.

Come on, folks, this is a man who felt charged with preserving the integrity of the faith handed down from the Apostles, in a time when many heretical interpretations denying Christ's divinity were being introduced.  After being challenged by the heretic Marcion for snubbing him, he replied, ""Yes, I know you, the first born of Satan.""  This guy was definitely NOT a creampuff.  Not a hint of this crucial struggle could be found in this film.  No, this film was not even about Polycarp--he was just a minor character in this conversion story of a young girl who could never in a million years have been convinced by the total lack of any substance whatsoever that any of the characters teach her about Christ.

In fact, I learned almost nothing about Polycarp from this movie beyond his discipleship to John, and his death by burning at the stake...oh wait, except that's not really accurate either, as he had to be dispatched with a spear when the flames wouldn't touch him.  But those details don't fit with the fluffy, empty, totally meaningless narrative in this film.  You would learn much, much more (and save 2 hours) by simply reading the Wikipedia article on him.",1454976000,20,1846,4.767295597484277

The acting is of the level of a middle-school play, the movie's pacing is way too slow, and the sets look fake. It's a shame because I'm sure the producers put a lot of effort into this, but the flaws in acting and plot are too  much to overcome.",1452988800,8,403,4.075949367088608
7131272,4,B00WEPI5WY,Good - on par with St Barbara. A little dramatic - still good dialogue and plot.,1449273600,,80,4.0625
7131273,5,B00WEPI5WY,"Dramatization of Polycarp's life in second century. His deep faith, loving concern for others and his focus on the scriptures add depth. Much of the dialogue is just reprising Bible texts, although without being phony.

For example Psalm 115:
""A mouth they have, but they cannot speak;
Eyes, but they cannot see;
Ears they have, but they cannot hear;
A nose, but they cannot smell;
Hands they have, but they cannot feel;
Feet, but they cannot walk""
This explanation has a powerful effect on the young girl. Wonderful!

When leaving Smyrna, his first concern is saving copies of the scriptures, not his life. When Christians are arrested, they pray that God protect their faith, not their life.

Shows how a young slave girl, freed by the Christians, starts with doubt and ends in faith. Each question, each trial, each example adds to her growing faith. Very well done.

Demonstrates the Roman official forcing Christians to burn incense to Caesar or die. Some do, some run, some die. Polycarp gives a marvelous witness at his trial. He is burned. He is happy to 'share in the sufferings of Christ'. Faith in action!

One facinating result of this early Christian refusal to worship the state, without resorting to violence, is that they won! Today no one is s disciple of Mars, the God of war. Nevertheless, support of similar ideas, war, is common all around the planet. Also, political powers still want to be treated as Gods. This drama of the early Christians creates thought provoking questions.

One interesting question is: How should Christians today apply this example, this ancient Christian refusal to worship Ceaser - the Roman State? Nationalism, devotion to the political state, is the most widespread religion of the present. Dying, killing, living for the nation is expected. Unlimited devotion to this human institution is the norm. This clearly was not the belief of these Christians.

The famous rule ""Give Caesars things to Caesar and God's things to God"" has dropped out of sight.

What does this indicate for present day Christians?

This film also does not present these Christians believing in the trinity. This is correct, since the trinity did not infiltrate Christianity until hundreds of years later. (See Isaac Newton - Corrupters Ancient and Modern; ''The Enlightenment: The Rise of Modern Paganism'', by Peter Gay; ''Michael Servetus: Intellectual Giant, Humanist, and Martyr'', by M.

7131280,4,B00WEPI5WY,"The movie, while using a very limited budget, was more thought-provoking and effective than most high-budget, secular-made movies.

The story revolved around a young girl named Anna, who was a slave.  She is bought by the kind-hearted and God-fearing Polycarp, who gives her freedom.  Anna becomes the charge of a couple, and she starts to feel like family among them all.  Germanicus is a young man who, like a brother, works along-side Anna.  Anna hears new and startling doctrines, of one God, not many.  She asks questions of her new family, and they answer with patience and joy.

But not all is joyous.  The Roman government is trying to quell the Christians.  And on the day of testing, will Polycarp stand for the truth of Jesus?  Will Germanicus?  And how will the persecution of Christians affect Anna? . . .

Some of the acting in this movie was not the very best, but Polycarp's (or rather, Garry Nation's) was good, as were Germanicus's (Dusty Martin's, who played on Courageous) and Anna's (Eliyah Hurt), most of the time.  In any case, I was moved to tears many times.  How would my faith hold up under fire?

It is made for the entire family to watch, with nothing graphic, though the themes are somewhat deep.  Based on the real lives of Polycarp and Germanicus, your family should find this film inspiring.

Bravo, young filmmakers, Joe and Jerica Henline!  They had a lot of help, of course, as you can see in the behind the scenes documentary, but they are still impressively gifted.  Most of all, the message shines through in this movie, the message of courage among fear, faith beyond failure, and the love of God, which casts out fear.",1442448000,,1659,4.697916666666667

When browsing through movies on Amazon, I stumbled upon this one and purchased it. I am so glad that I did. It's a well made Christian film that is very relevant in what people still go through today as they suffer in the name of Jesus. These days with all that is happening around the world, including here in America, we aren't far from the time of the early days of the first Christians. This is a Dove Foundation film and is very family friendly. Even though Polycarp ends up being killed at the end, it's made in such a way that doesn't show it or is too graphic for children. Even my three year old was able to watch it without being too frightened or worried. All of my children learned a lot and enjoyed learning about a hero of our faith.
