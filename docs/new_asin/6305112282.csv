7884232,4,6305112282,"Having purchased ""Doctor In Distress"" DVD because I am a fan of Samantha Eggar, I found the movie enjoyable and funny as Doctors' Simon Sparrow played by Dirk Bogarde and Sir Lancelot Spratt played by James Robertson Justice maneuver through various medical misadventures and still have time for love.  A radiant and beautiful Samantha Eggar is wonderful as the sweet and enchanting Delia Mallory, who is Doctor Simon Sparrow's love interest.  I recommend this DVD for your movie collection as I am sure you will enjoy ""Doctor In Distress"" as it takes you on a ride through British medical humor.",1381104000,,596,4.95

Directed by: Ralph Thomas

Another great film from the British Invasion which VCI has restored and brought from their vaults.

This movie sees the return, after an absence of six years, of Dirk Bogarde to the role of Doctor Simon Sparrow.

'Doctor In Distress' is my personal favorite of the 'Doctor' series. To be honest, Bogarde is largely wasted in this film; still it is nice to see Simon Sparrow for one final time.  The film main emphasis is not placed on the young, bungling medic, but, refreshingly, focuses on the wonderful James Robertson Justice as Sir Lancelot Spratt.  It's a joy to see James Robertson Justice take center stage for a change, whether bashfully admitting his childhood nickname of 'Porker' or visiting a health farm; he never fails to raise a smile.  It is a real pleasure to see these two fine actors reunited once again.

You do come away with a smile of satisfaction, the supporting cast is a real who's who of British screen acting, with people like Timothy Bateson, John Bluthal, Donald Houston and a nice surprise to see Michael Flanders as the food writer at the health farm.

But for James Robertson Justice, his acting credentials are priceless in the early 60s, simply perfect.
