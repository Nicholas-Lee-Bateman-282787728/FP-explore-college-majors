5185351,4,B008VL04PQ,"As part of my 8th grade U.S. History classes' study of life and culture of the United States after the revolution, we look at literature. One of the best writers of the time is Washington Irving. This re-telling of the Rip Van Winkle story is just the right length of time to keep my students interested and the right tone for them to be able to understand the story without problems with vocabulary of early 19th century writers. Anjelica Houston has a great voice for the narration and the illustrations are excellent. The disc got to me before I thought it would and in great condition.",1400976000,2,589,4.566037735849057
5185352,5,B008VL04PQ,"We have watched several of the Rabbit Ears Entertainment series.  Most of them run for less than half an hour, and each is narrated by a speaker with fine professional qualifications.  The real draw is the story, and the slides or animation add visual interest.  Most of the stories are fairly close to the originals we remember from childhood and such alterations as there are add interest and entertainment.  We recommend all of them and suggest sharing them with your children and grandchildren, especially because the younger ones have often not read or encountered the stories.

Because they are short and hold one's interest, try one and you'll be hooked, unless you are happen to be an old curmudgeon.",1399334400,,708,4.915966386554622
5185353,5,B008VL04PQ,"Narrated by Angelica Huston, this classic tale comes alive once again! Lazy but endearing to all the village (except his wife) Rip Van Winkle nods off to sleep. Time passes him by and he awakes an old man with his friends and family having departed in the customary way of aging. Enchanting. Again, my grandchildren accompany me on yet another adventure!",1376352000,,354,4.819672131147541

8531056,5,B008VL04PQ,"My girls and I watch these books at least 3 times a week together snuggled in my bed, it is really comfy and the stories are always GREAT!
I thought  Rip Van Winkle was really fun! As a plus my 8 year old daughter looked at me and said ""mommy, I am NEVER taking alcohol from a stranger!"" lol  So 2 good lesson learned, don't be lazy and don't be taking drinks from weirdo's.  All narrated by Anjelica Houston-Awesome.",1412726400,,417,4.253164556962025
