975043,5,6305178429,IT'S THE BADEST VIDEO FROM THE BADEST DEAD MAN IN  THE WWF AND THE WORLD(UNDERWORLD)WATCH IT IF YOU  DON'T LIKE IT YOU CAN REST IN PEACE,912038400,,136,4.1923076923076925
975164,5,6305178429,"This is by far one of the better WWF video/DVD releases detailing the career of the Undertaker. Who can forget his shocking first introduction when he single-handedly ambushed nearly half of THE DREAM TEAM in the 1990 SURVIVOR SERIES? Or for that matter his match with HULK HOGAN in the 1991 SURVIVOR SERIES? He has been loved by many fans whether he was good or bad or neutral.
There are memorable matches a many throughout such as the Boiler Room Brawl with Mick Foley, feuds with Giant Gonzales, the SURVIVOR SERIES feud with Yokozuna, and King Kong Bundy at WM11, and more provocatively the ongoing battle against his brother Kane, particular at WM14.
There's the burial match, the tombstone match, and many others all included. This is sure to please. That's Classy Freddy Blassie narrating.",1077840000,5,796,4.9037037037037035
975165,4,6305178429,"This is a great video, one of my wwf favorites. It features the Undertaker as he was on the dark side and goes through many of his best matches. It features matches such as hell in cell with HBK, Kanes arrival, and the inferno match to name a few. If you liked the undertaker in the Dark side then I suggest this video. Overall this is a highlight video of him. The only problems I have with this DVD is that it lacks any bonus extras and that there are no chapters to skip through the DVD. Basically if you have a VHS player save yourself the money since the DVD and the VHS are about the same but if not it's worth the trouble to find The Undertaker: The Phenom on DVD.",1055808000,,671,4.052631578947368
975166,5,6305178429,"Whether you like or dislike the Undertaker, this a video for any wrestling fan. This tape has astounding matches such as the Boiler Room Brawl, Buried Alive, Hell In a Cell with Shawn Michaels and Mankind, Inferno match with Kane, a Casket Match, and a Triple Threat Match between Undertaker, Kane, and Stone Cold. If you like wrestling this is a video you must have!",1025827200,,367,4.661538461538462
975167,2,6305178429,"Slick productions values circa 1998, beyond that its not worth the money  unless you are a die hard Undertaker fan, not the best video the WWF as come out with, but in todays world it is a classic.",1014681600,,197,4.184210526315789
975168,4,6305178429,"This video is very good whether the video is good or not. Cause
I'm a huge undertaker's fan. But running time is too short and
the end of video is not good. So I give 4star on this video.^^
If you watching this video, why he's the lord of darkness..
I wanna digging the grave with him on demon night.. what a crea
tures of the night.. Can you join us?
For whom the bell tolls..a...........Rest in piece.... The undertaker forever~! ..& ..his brother too!",1004486400,,454,4.352941176470588
975169,5,6305178429,"The Undertaker is one of the most celebrated veterans of professional wrestling. He has thousands of fans, and has carried the same gimmick for over a decade. You would think that they would have plenty of footage to choose from.
Apparently, someone decided that the Undertaker's early career wasn't worth mentioning. They also decided to seriously edit the few matches that were included. Who wants to see cut up versions of the classic boiler room (with Mankind) and inferno (with Kane) matches? I don't.
If you love the Undertaker, you'll probably buy this just to say you have it. If you want to see his classic matches in all their glory, find a place that sells old PPV rental tapes instead of wasting your time with this -- there's plenty of sound and fury, but it signifies little.",980553600,,789,4.72463768115942
975170,5,6305178429,"I really liked this video about the undertaker,it shows his classic  battles with mankind. Like the boiler room brawl & the brilliant brutal  hell in a cell match at the 1998 king of the ring. Also it shows when kane  made his debute at the 1997 badd blood event,The undertaker and kane in all  their classic matches the inferno match aswell as the match at wrestlemania  14. I recommend this video for any big undertaker fan so go buy it now if u  want,or buy stone colds video, hell yeah! thats wicked!",968025600,3,504,4.423913043478261
975171,3,6305178429,"I felt the video was ok, though they should of put more of his earlier  matches with the ultimate warrior, and when he first entered in the wwf  during survivor series. Also the music is great. I will like to know the  musical during the badd blood match when the cell was being made. who ever  knows the musical please e-mail me at sotoeddie@hotmail.com.",965433600,,355,4.5
975202,5,6305178429,"....Even in hot summer nights, theirs always a chill in the air.  The Best of The Undertaker on his own video, Undertaker: The Phenom starting from his interduction to the WWF, to classic battles with the demented Mankind  in Boiler Room Brawl, Hell in a Cell, and Burried alive matches and his  'Flaming' reunioun with his long lost brother, Kane.  But it's not a family  reunioun your used to, unless you fight your brother in Inferno and WWF  Championship Matches.  This video is for all of Taker's fans!",959212800,,507,4.693181818181818
975203,5,6305178429,"This video was really great. The only drawback is the old man. It showed allof his greatest matches, since his WWF title matches were bad. I gave this five stars since it showed how powerful this man is when he is ticked  off.",957657600,,226,4.255813953488372
975204,5,6305178429,I loved this video. The old man narrator was pretty bad though. Could have showed him in his prime. Boiler room brawl was the best part and thats only at the beginning.,945907200,,168,4.28125
975205,5,6305178429,This is the best video with the best wrestler today! Undertaker will always be #1. So everyone who disagrees can R.I.P! Live on Undertaker.,926985600,,139,4.833333333333333
7884222,4,6305178429,"Nice little documentary covering the Undertakers career over the first part of the Attitude era.

But if you have already seen the matches in full  then go ahead as this provides a good recap!

Lots of fueds with Mankind and Kane, bit with Steve Austin too, and Shawn Michaels. Great for any old-school fans.",1356652800,,434,4.576923076923077
7884227,5,6305178429,"This is a re-release of the VHS that was originally released in 1998. There are no extra features.

These are not full matches. But the highlights cover the best parts of the matches. The highlights are accompanied by background music and sometimes, commentary. Before and after each match, there is a small narration by a voice that sounds very similar to Freddy Blassie so he could be the one who's doing it.

Not only do the narrations fit well (they chose the right words), but they placed each narration where it fits perfectly. They are accompanied by an underscore of Taker's Volume 3 theme. The underscore makes that theme more iconic than it already is.

The intro is one of the best intros I have ever seen in my life. And believe me, that is no exaggeration. It has a narration with an underscore of Taker's theme in the background. But after the narration, the underscore cut to the original version of Taker's theme. I'm not sure of this was his actual titantron at the time or not, but one amazing sight is the few shots shown of the individuals performing Taker's theme.

After talking about each match, I will talk a bit about the BGM that is heard during the matches.

Summerslam 96
Taker and Mankind had one of the  best feuds in history back in 96, And this first ever Boiler Room Brawl match was part of of it. These two men battered each other with any object they got their hands on. It was amazing how they were able to stand, let alone walk from the Boiler Room to the ring. The clear winner was screwed via a very unexpected, shocking and bitter betrayal.

BGM: Music was perfect. When Taker asked for the Urn, Paul turned his back & I saw a look in Taker's face and especially his eyes that I haven't seen before. His face & the background music together..it actually feel sorry for him because after all he went through, he was betrayed. The music used here was also used in The Best Of Survivor Series to highlight Bret's match with Backlund at Survivor Series 94.

In Your House: Buried Alive
Another brawl. But objects were not used as much here as they were at Summerslam. Taker was stalking Paul, but turned and got a chair shot from Mankind who later on hit a piledriver on Taker on a chair. But Taker sat up, nailed Mankind in the back with the chair & then he placed the chair on Mankind and hit a legdrop. The Executioner debuted nailing Taker in the back of the head with a shovel & he and Mankind buried Taker. But after a lighting bolt struck, Taker's hand rose from the grave.

BGM: Great music. Also used for HBK's Road To WM14 video package that they aired on RAW in 1998.

In Your House: Badd Blood
The iconic, history making match. Hell In A Cell #1, a match which Taker himself has stated is his favorite. I can see why despite the fact that he lost. This is one of those matches where you have to see it who know why it's so great because people's opinions won't do the match any justice. The same can be said for the other Hell In A Cell match that will be highlighted here later on.

BGM: One of my favorites. It was the same one used for the Royal Rumble 98 intro.

Royal Rumble 1998
The Casket Match that either caused the injury to HBK's back or just added fuel to the fire so to speak. In any case, it was a great match from these two. I love how unlike the Hell In A Cell match, this highlight has very little commentary. Don't get me wrong. The commentary in 98 was the best. But sometimes, it's nice to watch a match with everything (Music, crowd noise, etc) but the commentary. Kane appeared in the end.

BGM: One of the best I've ever heard.

Wrestlemania 14
An all out physical war between two brothers with supernatural power. This has several months of build up, something rarely if ever, seen these days. Kane did what no one else has been able to - kick out of 2 Tombstone Piledrivers. Taker did kick out of Kane's though also. Taker missing the dive and crashing through the Spanish announce table was another highlight.

BGM: They chose a great one here.

Unforgiven 98
The first ever Inferno Match. This is a match that was rarely seen just like the Buried Alive match. With WWE's current PG direction, I doubt we will see another Inferno match. The last was seen at Armageddon 2006 when Kane faced and defeated MVP. Out of all the Inferno matches, the first is still the best. Taker launching himself like a missile over the flames is a spectacular sight to see. Another great sight is when Taker walked the ropes & performed Old School while the flames went up. They also went up when Taker superplexed Kane, when Taker tried to leave the ring after tossing Kane to the outside (this was before he hit the Missile like suicide dive), and when they chokeslammed each other.

BGM: I remember this highlight having two BGM's, not one. I think the second one started when Taker chokeslammed Kane. They were both great. They made the right choice in the second BGM because it fit Taker's suicide dive as well as JR's commentary while the move was being done.

KOTR 98
Not only is it an iconic match, it is an historical match. Perhaps more so than the first Hell In A Cell match. Like the first one, hearing or reading opinions and thoughts does not do this match justice. You have to see it. The King & JR's every word following the match really spoke volumes and just added this match even more.

BGM: This also had more than one and while they were all good, I liked the one heard after the match the best because it fits JR & King's words well.

There was another KOTR 98 highlight. It was the closing moments of The Austin/Kane WWF Title match where Taker hit Austin with a chair. The BGM was an underscore of Taker's theme. They seriously need to release an underscore of this theme!

Summerslam 98
A classic bout that emanated from the hallowed halls of MSG. Taker kept his word, doing everything he said he would. But thanks to a low blow, Austin retained the WWF Title. But just barely. If you saw the post0match interview with Austin, he'll pretty much confirm that himself.

BGM: Great music. The one heard after the match as Taker is handing the belt to Austin really made that moment more special.

IYH: Break-Down
This is the only highlight on the entire DVD not to have BGM. This was more or less a handicap match even though King constantly said this favored Austin in classic heel fashion. Taker & Kane turned on each other at certain times. But in the end, a double chokeslam from the two brothers caused Austin to lose the WWF Title.

IYH: Judgment Day
The vacant WWF Title was on the line as both brothers waged war against each other. And Austin was the guest referee! In typical Stone Cold fashion, he let them do whatever they wanted. They did attack Austin too by the way. At one point, Austin fast counted Kane's pin, but would not count Taker's at all. In the end, Paul Bearer came out with a chair and struck Kane, who was then nailed again by a chairshot from The Undertaker.

BGM: To me, the music heard while they made their entrances is a fantastic choice because I felt it fit their entrances best here. It's the same one heard in the KOTR 98 highlight after Taker pinned Mankind. The BGM for the match fit too. It was rock music & it worked well because it was a war between these two, a slugfest as JR or King called it.

What followed was Taker's theme (not the underscore this time) and he and Paul Bearer making their way into the ring athe following Monday night on RAW. Words of the promo Taker gave on this night are heard as well. The one where he said that he would unleash a plague that the WWF has never seen and those who did not declare would be declared. And then there were various words which described Taker or the essence of Taker. Words were provided by the man who did all the narrations along with a female. As I said above, the narrator's voice sounds like Blassie's and the female sounds like Stephanie Mcmahon. The closing shot is one that is shown all the time so everyone must have seen it by now. It's the shot of a gravestone with a big white moon in the sky.

Despite no special features or full length matches, this is as epic as epic can get.",1330300800,,8168,4.381361533377396
