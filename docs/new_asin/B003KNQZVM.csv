8398797,5,B003KNQZVM,"The only complaint I have about this DVD is that it's only 5 songs.
Maybe he hasn't made a whole lot more than this, but Joe Nichols is a great C&W singer, and seems to be a fun-loving guy, and it shows in his videos.
I love ""Broken Hearts-ville,"" and all the others, too.
Evidently, Joe has had a few problems, but I hope that doesn't cut short his presence on the music scene.
He's just head and shoulders above most of the others, and I hope we see a lot more of him.",1320883200,,470,4.01063829787234
