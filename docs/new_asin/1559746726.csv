7796059,4,1559746726,"This covers the rise and eventual fall of totalitarianism in East Germany after WWII.

A good overview of the history of the region, how the Soviet Liberators were initially, understandably welcomed as heroes, and how many east Germans deeply believed in the possibility of creating a socialist utopia in the first years after the war.

In succinct but human fashion, by following a few specific people and families, we can see the change of the East German government into one that came to see its own people as the enemy, and treated them that way.

It's also a reminder of how remarkable the fall of Soviet domination in eastern Europe was, and what an amazing figure Gorbachev was for pushing his country to allow radical moves towards change, openness and reform even at the cost of its own empire.  There's a powerful
sequence when Gorbachev comes to East Germany for it's 40th anniversary, only to give a speech that amounted to `you'd better change your ways' and `don't expect us to prop you up any more'  The cuts to East German leader Honecker's ever more frozen smile during the
speech are priceless.

Throughout, the film uses poetry, music, diaries of dissidents who took their lives in their hands to fight for a free Germany, along with interviews with both dissidents and ex-Stasi members who often seem totally lost now that their regime has crumbled, and are both emotionally and morally lost as to how to look back on their lives.

Perhaps a little too conventional in style, and a little thin at moments from trying to cover so much history in an under 2 hour film, this is still an excellent exploration of the people of a nation finally finding freedom.",1333065600,,1676,4.738831615120275
7796060,5,1559746726,"This extremely comprehensive documentary covers dissidents from the East German regime from their resistance to the Nazis through the post-unification trials of Politburo members.  While the stories of key dissenters like Robert Havemann are highlighted, this nearly two-hour documentary provides a history of the rise and fall of the German Democratic Republic and the ideology of the regime.  It is packed full of original historical footage, including that of post-war cities in ruin, escapes through the pre-Berlin Wall barbed-wire fence, and the famous anti-regime demonstrations in Leipzig.  The documentary contains very rare footage of Young Pioneer and Frei Deutscher Jugend rallies, People's Assembly meetings, and the Stasi's own film of dissidents.  Especially well done is the sequence interspersing 1989 film of Gorbachev, Honecker and assembled communists singing ""Die Internationale"" with footage of massive pro-freedom demonstrations in the streets. I especially enjoyed the present-day interviews with dissidents, Stasi officers, bureaucrats, and churchmen.

Even if you already know a lot about East Germany, this documentary enlightens.  You can read about those FDJ rallies, but there is nothing like seeing the comrades gathered en masse giving over-the head salutes. You can read about the Stasi, but there is nothing like hearing them explain themselves, or viewing the secret films they made.  And this is the first time I've seen footage of Hohenschoenhausen, the Stasi interrogation prison in East Berlin.  The dissidents' stories, told in their own words, are moving.

If you enjoy this documentary -- and I am sure you will -- you may want to invest in CNN's 8-tape video history of the Cold War.  ""Stasiland,"" by Anna Funder, is an excellent and entertaining book about dissidents in the GDR.  For more on the Stasi, read John Koehler's thorough treatment of the agency, ""Stasi: The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police,"" or an interesting but biased account, ""Man Without a Face,"" by Markus Wolf, head of the Stasi's foreign service.",1111104000,7,2073,5.446875
