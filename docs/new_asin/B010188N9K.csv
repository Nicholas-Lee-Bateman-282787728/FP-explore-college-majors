7304683,1,B010188N9K,Horrible acting and many unreal situations.  Even the moral of the plot is vague.,1482883200,,81,4.785714285714286
7304684,5,B010188N9K,I liked it. Nice story about family and faith. Something you can watch with the entire family.  Very strong performance from Savannah McMahon and a really great performance by William G. Way as the father.  Thought he was really strong.,1482710400,,236,4.875
7304685,2,B010188N9K,"Very 'after school special' with a Christian moral. If that's your thing, then go for it.",1481932800,,89,4.625
7304686,2,B010188N9K,"I am sure there is supposed to be a message here, but thirty minutes in I see so many mistakes that even people with no desert savvy would not make.  Not enough water.  Plan on just being overnight?  You never go into the desert without being overly prepared.  Only one hat shown early on and they it disappears.  It would take over a gallon of water each on a hot day and then some.  Who hikes in the sun.  Early morning and evening, but not in the broiling sun.  Needless to say, this is a very frustrating watch  The mother gets hurt and at this point no effort is made to shade her body, just slide a blanket under her head.  Then lying in a creek bed waiting for a flash flood.  Trying to feed and share water with a coyote?  Disney concept at its best.  Will finish watching simply because we are having a winter storm.",1481932800,,825,4.178343949044586
7304687,3,B010188N9K,"Ah, some of the hiking scenes are less thought about. Who goes hiking with a few bottles of water in the desser? And everyone getting hurt is just trying to draw in the drama when in reality the probability of that happening is almost nil. The tension was not palpable between family members.",1481846400,,292,4.528301886792453

7304700,4,B010188N9K,"""Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and the evidence of things not seen"". (Hebrews,
Chapter 11, Verse 1, New American Bible). This is a poignant movie that tests the faith of a family when faced with tragedy. The story line and acting are good. The characters displayed genuine emotion giving credence to the predicament and obstacles they faced. The desert scenes and animals the family encountered added to their emotional strain. The foreboding musical score was also a plus. Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a tragedy to find out about a person's true character and if a transformation of that person is needed. The only negative for this movie was the abrupt ending. Otherwise, this was a touching drama about endurance, love, and faith.",1485734400,2,754,4.992063492063492
7304701,3,B010188N9K,"This was a tough one to review.  I liked that it had a happy ending and that dad saw the error of his ways and changed into a better husband and father.  I also liked how Katie gave him a hard time about finding those inappropriate text messages. The premise of the story was good and the message was clear.  I don't expect it to be first rate given the low budget most of these faith based films have, but this one was lacking in some character development and plot.  Too much time was spent watching either Kevin or Katie hiking out of the desert and not enough was spent on the ending showing both the rescue and the changes that the family went through.  There needed to be more dialogue between Katie and her father showing how he comes to have a stronger faith.  I also think they were pretty ill prepared for a hike in the desert with so little water and supplies, so that makes it slightly less believable.  In the end, it was a clean show that had a positive faith based message.  It was not the best in this genre, but wasn't the worst either, so I'd say I would recommend it for a cold winter night- all the hot sun and desert scenes will make you forget the snow in no time!",1485648000,5,1186,4.171052631578948

7304714,3,B010188N9K,"I have watched many films whose premise is based on surviving an unexpected emergency in a remote environment. This film is one of those, but the main reason why I took a chance with it is because it had Savanah McMahon as one of the lead characters. Obviously, I thought she did an amazing job with her role, but the rest of the cast's characters were poorly developed in my mind. The best way to know if you will survive watching this film is to ask yourself this single question: Do you like works that feature survival and redemption? If so, I think this is one film you should consider watching now or in the future.",1484524800,,621,4.362068965517241

Great writing and despite some amateur minor characters, the 3 main characters were excellent and very convincing.  Some clunky moments didn't detract from the drama, suspense, and uplifting storyline.

7304729,1,B010188N9K,"Another of the Faith House pictures and again starring Savanah McMahon. Unfortunately this one was poorly scripted, poorly acted and poorly produced.  Obviously put together by someone who has absolutely no knowledge of desert hiking. As for being a story of redemption, it was totally lacking in any such message.  About the only thing the father got right (and mother and daughter had wrong) was don't try and feed animals in the wild. Not a good plan for the people involved and definitely not in the best interests of the animals.

Not a movie I could recommend.",1483056000,,566,4.814432989690721
8721231,2,B010188N9K,"I did enjoy the young actress in this but it appears no one with any knowledge of desert hiking was a writer on this.  Leaving late morning in June. They're going to camp but no sleeping bags to be seen, just tiny backpacks like you would take to high school. No hats for everyone, just a handful of 16-ounce water bottles (you need at a minimum a gallon of water per person per day).  Then Mom falls off of what appears to be a 50-foot drop which would likely be fatal and her husband, rather than try and put up the tent for shade, just takes off. I almost laughed aloud when the Dad said: ""it's not supposed to be hot in June, it's over 100 degrees out"".  Standard temperatures in the desert in any part of the US in June is 100+.  Then Mom goes 2 days without a sip of water and is still alive to be rescued. I did enjoy a Christian message but the improbability of the whole storyline really ruined it for me.",1533772800,,914,4.117977528089888
8721232,3,B010188N9K,"Pretty good primer on what not to do when hiking overnight. Spoilers: First of, they should have had these things called tankards. (backpacks with nothing but water). Then you always bring a buck knife, moleskin and a lighter. As a camper and backpacker myself (3 times down the Grand Canyon), I found the mistakes hard to swallow even for a novice. Mom falling off a cliff, trying to reach a bottle of water? Dad breaking his leg on the was back to the car to get help and losing his keys on top of it? The girl ended up being resourceful, but mom and dad were lucky to stay alive. It did have a Christian theme to it, but not over the top.

The best part was the bad acting.  Who falls off a cliff seriously...and don't get me started on that weak limp from a little scorpion sting.  Ouch my ankle hurts let me proceed to slice my palm open. Oh there's a hole in the tent, let's sew it up instead of putting a piece of tape over it that we'll use later on to collect rainwater.  Do we really need to see the vultures circling above 14 times?  I think we got the hint after the first 5 scenes of that.
