It is a dark and stormy night. A man quietly enters a hotel. The Sheriff arrives to spend the night upstairs. A woman enters and asks for a room. So do a young couple, they get the bridal chamber. A man enters and asks for his $4,000 to be placed in the safe. Later a stranger opens the safe (he spied the combination) and takes the money. Did he leave a clue? The Sheriff sees a man by the open safe. Could a man see the combination from the window? Was it the Polka Dot bandit? Could the wrong man be blamed? The Sheriff finds a shack, beans are cooking. The men of Yucca City talk about the Mason Gang. What can they do? Outside they hear gunshots. ""Please help us!"" There is a chase and shots, men fall into the river. ""What happened?"" The rest of the gang rides into town. What will Miss Betty do? Her dead father is carried back to town. Will the wrong man be blamed?

One man offers $100 for each homestead. Can the people make one more attempt to get food and ammunition? Miss Betty overhears the plotters and is kidnapped. One man volunteers to acquire food and ammunition so people can survive. He finds Miss Nathan and learns of the treachery. Can they foil the crooks? Not if they learn of their plans. ""Look, they're coming back!"" They race back to town. The gang shoots at the good guys, but they continue. The gang takes a new route into town along a creek. But another explosion blocks their way. Miss Betty tells the townsmen about the gold in their lands. John Carruthers explains the mistaken identification to the Sheriff. We meet the US Marshal, the man from Sacramento, and his accusations. John and Miss Betty ride off to their future.

This story tells how a town that lacks food and ammunition becomes rich at the end from a valuable mineral buried in their lands. [Its funny no one noticed it before.] This is the classic Western where people are threatened by a gang that seeks to swindle them out of their land. It echoes true events (such as in ""The Banditti of the Plains""). There were other cases. The small businesses and neighborhoods in American cities would soon decay from new shopping malls and suburbs that benefitted big corporations.",1511222400,,2196,4.471321695760598
