8038662,5,B00064ZD34,Its basically a good stretching video. My plan for this video was to use it after exercise and before I go to bed. The video is a little over 20 min and I am cool with that,1337385600,5,172,3.675675675675676
8038663,3,B00064ZD34,"This is just Victoria alone doing basic stretching, not even yoga. It is done in a soothing, flowing way to increase grace & body awareness, but no spiritual terms or new age, etc. She speaks about which muscles are used & stretched & she tells you often how to modify for everything. Basic plies, lunges, torso stretches to the side, reclined & seated stretches. It's only 23 min for the actual workout & probably filmed in the '90s w/professional quality.",1262044800,5,457,4.725
