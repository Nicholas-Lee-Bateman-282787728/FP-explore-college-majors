4657464,5,B005D7E7Y0,My family loves watching these timeless classics together. My husband loves the commentaries with producer David Dortort and pictures of cast. We can't wait to purchase season 3.,1321660800,5,178,5.392857142857143
4657465,3,B005D7E7Y0,I now have first season 1 & 2 and second season 1 & 2 and I've read some of the reviews that customers have written praising the picture quality. But to tell the truth I find the picture to be somewhat washed out. I had just seen the episode 'silent thunder' a week ago on TV land and when I got my set I happened to view that same episode again and it just didn't seem as clear on my DVD set as it did on cable. I thought maybe it was a defected disk but all of them were like that. Is it just me or does someone else notice the same thing.,1320278400,17,541,3.754385964912281

4657468,5,B005D7E7Y0,"There are so many great episodes in season 2 of this fantastic western series. I love the original episodes that helped shape Bonanza to what it became, and video quality on these is pristine. So much better than when they were first aired on NBC. If you ever loved Bonanza get these DVD's even if it's one season at a time like I have been doing. You won't be sorry.",1497916800,,367,4.257142857142857

4657478,4,B005D7E7Y0,"It took me too long to finish watching this set, but most all of them were enjoyable and decent quality. However, ""The Thunderhead Swindle"" (on the third disk of Volume 2 set - the last one on the disk) had NO SOUND...I didn't want to watch it with subtitles and silent, but I guess there's no getting a replacement for just that one disk. There were some enjoyable commentaries from some of the actors and writers on a few episodes which were clearly done many years after the fact (hence the main cast members aren't in them), but there are also special photos, previews, etc. Very nice for fans. Now if only I could get just that one disk replaced with one that has sound on the last episode....",1484956800,,698,4.4186046511627906

Compared to this, My Mother The Car should've run for six seasons instead of just one and furthermore...just kidding.  I love this show, every season of it.  I'm sorry, it's just that I've written so many wonderful things about it that I thought it would be a nice change of pace to say something awful about it even if I don't really mean it.

4657532,5,B005D7E7Y0,I was so impressed by the Season 5 set that I had that I went ahead and purchased Season's 2 and 3......these are the real McCoy....a lot of cheaper collections use fake music in the openings and such because they didn't want to put out money to purchase the rights for the original music.....this is not one of those!!!  From beginning to end it's like sitting around the TV on a Sunday night in the 60's watching one of the best.  It's a little humorous that CBS own the rights to these NBC shows but who cares in the long run.......their great!!!,1407283200,,549,4.372549019607843

4657538,5,B005D7E7Y0,"A great deal from Amazon. I only wish they would put more like this on sale. The prices the studios want for these type of series, part 1 and part 2 are just to high. I don't buy many like this because of the high price. The 5 star rating is for the product quality not a recommendation of the pricing.",1397433600,,302,3.9672131147540983

4657540,5,B005D7E7Y0,"As I've said before and have been saying since Christmas, I'm enjoying Bonanza for the first time in my life!  Of course I remember watching it growing up but I was really just in the room  physically while my parents were actually watching and enjoying the series in 1959/60.  I was too young to care about anything but the fast draws and would get up and go play in another room when the ""drama"" took over.  By the time it moved to Sunday nights, I was really not interested and has purposely not watched the show since in syndication out of some misplaced snobbery about it being  ""my parents show"".  Well, now that my wife bought me a best of DVD I've found out what I've been missing.  As a result, I'm buying the series by Season.  I've S1, S2, & S3 of both volumes each and it's money well spent.  I will buy more but might probably give up when Pernell Roberts leaves, but then again, I was wrong before so I may ride with the Cartwright boys right to the end.

The episodes were very well written and the guest stars ran the gamut from television actors to motion picture stars.  I loved the episode with Ida Lupino (great actress and director as well.  ""Have Gun Will Travel"" fans will know what I'm speaking about as she directed many of the episodes of that great series).  As I tend to add before I depart; when will Amazon get the John Russell, Peter Brown ""Lawman"" series?  I'm just waiting (however impatiently)",1396915200,5,1427,4.396946564885496
4657541,5,B005D7E7Y0,These programs are great to entertain the entire family.  No real violence and no profanity.  Wish the producers today would take lessons from those earlier producers and leave out the violence and profanity.  These 2 things ruin many otherwise great programs.,1396483200,,260,5.2926829268292686

4657544,5,B005D7E7Y0,"Finally the ""real thing"" on DVD instead of these other DVD's with that horrid music instead of the Livingston & Evans theme. The picture is sharp and the opening NBC logos and promos are great!!",1393718400,3,194,4.571428571428571
4657545,5,B005D7E7Y0,"What more can I say of all Bonanza episodes are true western tales of cattlemen living and surviving in the old wild west!

4657550,5,B005D7E7Y0,I would recommend this season to anyone it was fun seeing how Adams mom died and how well they were working with each other. I especially loved the Vengeance and the Gift.  My kids loved the Tax Collector and Bank Run.,1383004800,,218,4.317073170731708

The old shows are more family based. And that's what America needs.",1366156800,,149,4.172413793103448
4657555,2,B005D7E7Y0,"First let me say,  I love Bonanza.  It is my favorite television show from my youth.  So my rating doesn't reflect on the show itself at all -- but instead the quality of this season release.  I purchase Season 1 some time ago.  The quality of the video was amazing.  It was obvious the DVD authors had gone back to the original sources (probably the film itself) and the picture was crisp and clear.  I loved it.  So I didn't hesitate to put down the money for Seasons 2 and 3, expecting the same.  What a disappointment.  Season two looks like it was recorded on VHS then transferred to DVD.  There are constant color shifts, the video is noticeably ""sharpened"" in an attempt to cover the poor source -- resulting in harsh unnatural viewing.  The colors are washed out and pathetic.

Very, very disappointing.  Especially after the Season 1 release proved just how good this could be done when given the time and attention it deserves.",1365206400,8,937,4.566265060240964

I am having fun watching all of the episodes.  If you like Bonanza ir Love Bonanza these are definitely worth buying.",1356048000,,271,4.702127659574468
4657561,4,B005D7E7Y0,"I chose a four star rating because the show is that good. Bonanza set the standard for the westerns of that era.  The shows got better as time went on. You can see it in production values and the story lines. I would have given a five star rating but the picture quality on disc 2 was poor, the picture looked out of foucus.  When I watched disc three  the picture was sharper and quality good. Maybe I got a bad one but I still recommend the series. I'm a big fan of western television shows of the 60s and 70s and Bonanza is at the top of my list.",1353283200,,549,3.9727272727272727

4657563,5,B005D7E7Y0,I didn't order this as of yet I just wanted to know if season 1 0r 2 has the episode of where Hoss hides in the Coffin and the townspeople almost mistakenly bury him. I can't recall the name of this one but it sure was funny I would like to get that one plus all the others I love Bonanza.,1335484800,,289,3.7540983606557377
4657564,5,B005D7E7Y0,"Thanks to friends who have purchased the German-released DVD sets, I've seen many complete episodes that can't be seen here.  When I realized seasons 1& 2 were finally available in the States, I snapped them up and have no regrets. The picture quality is good and the scenes don't fade to black too soon like some other older shows recently released and the music is true and clear.  The commentary is a nice bonus that gives die-hard fans an inside glimpse of behind-the-scenes info we crave.  Frankly, even without the bonus features, I'm thrilled to own seasons 1& 2 and anxiously await the release of subsequent seasons.  Please hurry!!",1333756800,11,640,4.844036697247707
