6798070,5,B00PEA6KRI,"To be honest, I have had import VHS and DVD copies of this series for decades both in raw Japanese, and with *awful* English subtitles. This first time licensed release in North America is amazing, and exactly what I would have expected from Eastern Star/Discotek. I just hope it sells well enough to encourage them to release related series such as Great Mazinger, UFO Robot Grendizer, and Steel Jeeg.  As a fan of the Super Robot Genre, I can only hope to see more. Thank you.",1420675200,20,478,4.558139534883721

8687660,5,B00PEA6KRI,"After all these years, we finally get a chance to see this series in commercial release!! One of the kings of the Giant robot anime saga has a release on DVD!! These DVDS are release Japanese language with English subtitles! These are original US release from the 1970's. They originally aired 1976 on UHF, KWHY-TV, Channel 22. With snow, on a black & white TV screen, (due to bad reception, a regular TV antenna, and a TV station 100 miles away) I was able to watch these shows 6 O'clock Sundays nights. What a delight it is to finally get these on DVD for the first time and in full color too!!

ENJOY!!",1460505600,2,605,4.353982300884955

Audio:
The only audio present here is Japanese Dolby stereo 2.0 and it sounds pretty good without any noticeable distortions.

Video:
This series was originally broadcast in 1972, and looks good here. The cel animation holds up fine and colors are vibrant and steady. The nuances of old-school sketch-line animation are still fun to watch. The subtitles are colored and detailed appropriately, which makes them easy to read as needed.

Extras:
Theres a surprising set of extras on her not listed on any sites or even the DVD cover itself. Discotek managed to sneak in 3 short pilot episodes taken from 8mm film and transferred them on here without any restoration / color enhancement. Its very nostalgic to see them on here like this, depending how far back you might remember grainy pictures, dials and rabbit ears being on your TV sets.

In Summary:
I hadnt had a chance to watch this series before these sets were released. Though Ive really enjoyed the super robot genre, Id only seen the mini-movies, Mazinkaiser and Shin Mazinger Z-Hen before featuring these characters. Its been great to see the show that originated the genre Go Nagai is so heavily credited for.",1450742400,5,1312,5.233333333333333
