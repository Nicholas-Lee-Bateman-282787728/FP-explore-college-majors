8446956,4,B000MM0LG4,"I bought this mainly because of the lead actor, Joe McFadden. He played Sgt. Mason in the last two episodes of the long-running (and much missed) British TV series ""Heartbeat."" This is a very different type of role for him, and he is quite good in it. On the other hand, I found the actress who played his (ex) girlfriend to be somewhat irritating...but then maybe she was supposed to be. The other actors are all very good. It's basically a small picture about relationships and the fragility of them. Worth watching...and a must if you are a Joe McFadden fan.",1495065600,,561,4.564356435643564
