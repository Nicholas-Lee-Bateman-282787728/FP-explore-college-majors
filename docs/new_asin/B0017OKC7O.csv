3174695,5,B0017OKC7O,What a great movie. My daughters professor brought this film in his class for his students to watch and learn. Being a good daughter she passed it on to her mother - me.  SO i pass it on to you all especially all my American Indian brothers and sisters. A reminder for us all.

3174697,5,B0017OKC7O,"I have watched this movie more times than the average person would think of watching it, and I am going to watch it again.  Every time I watch it I get a little more out of the Actors,and out of the story. I always walk away smiling and feeling good.  The Native American scenes were great, and I thought it gave a positive statement to them. Th brown bag seen was a gift for those who stereo type thme.  It had everything a good movie should have.

3174700,5,B0017OKC7O,"It's snowing and icy outside .. and with general garbage and repeats on the tube, I stumbled upon this film on PBS.  Thinking it was going to be nothing, it turned into something indeed. And something I intend to buy as soon as I'm finished with this review.  The caracters are outstanding and the acting as well. Being a fan of dark humor (think Fargo, Leaving Ozona and the like)and Native American I was pleasently surprised by this film. I recommend it whole heartedly.",1229817600,3,473,4.619047619047619
3174701,5,B0017OKC7O,"I watched this movie last night on PBS and am going to preorder this DVD in the next couple days.  I was just flipping around and stopped for what was to be a minute (came in probably 15-20 minutes into the movie) and didn't touch the remote again until the movie was over.  All Movie Guide refers the tone of the movie as ""quirky,"" and I agree (in no bad way).  I really enjoyed the storyline of the movie and seeing many familiar Seattle sites.  With it's black comedy mixed with a little suspense, a little action, and an appropriate dose of falling in love, it was perfect.  I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who might be just a little tired of the comic book remakes and special effect heavy movies being mass produced in Hollywood these days.  While I haven't watched many Independent Films, just seeing this film is making me think ""what have I been missing?""",1229644800,5,880,4.46875
3174702,5,B0017OKC7O,"I absolutely love this movie.  It was recommended to me by a friend who knows the director.  I was like ""great, an independent film YAY""(I'm being sarcastic); however, I was shockingly surprised.  This movie has a great story line.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, keeps you laughing/crying, and you get a little knowledge on Native Americans.  I also love the fact that I know where every location is in this movie.  I have watched this movie over a dozen times and I've passed it around to all my coworkers who ended up loving it also.  I would highly recommend getting this movie.  You certainly will not be disappointed.  It's worth every penny.",1229472000,5,656,4.586206896551724
3174703,4,B0017OKC7O,"I saw this in Seattle after the annual Seattle International Film Festival, and have been anxiously hoping that it would be released on video, because it did not find a distributor.  It was both hilarious and touching.  The main character is convinced that, like his father and grandfather before him, he is fated to die at the wheels (so to speak) of a dairy truck on his 25th birthday.  Thus his presumed ""expiration date.""  Not wanting to be a burden on his mother, he is in the process of tying up all his loose ends while she plots all the delivery routes of all milk trucks to avoid, and finds himself in a contested claim for a coffin.  With a young woman who strikes his heart, unwilling as he is to consider any attachments since he has no life expectancy.  The story gets tangled up from there.  Native American tradition is a part of the story, Seattle is featured as the alleys and byways, less than the famous landmarks, and the total is charming, disarming, a little bit bent, and genuinely moving.",1226707200,,1012,4.527472527472527
3174704,5,B0017OKC7O,"A great movie. It captures Seattle beautifully and recognizably, but without the in-your-face cliche shots of the city that you see in a lot of commercial films and on television. It's a genuinely funny movie and I love the heavily acoustic soundtrack. It's a movie that makes you happy. I felt like I had really watched something after I had seen it. Well worth the effort to find.",1215043200,,382,4.632352941176471

8266724,2,B0017OKC7O,I have only read excellent reviews about how this independent film sets itself apart and is great to watch.  While the movie wasn't horrible from a physical filming perspective it was not what I expected; I was unsure what to think about the choppy plot and lack of depth....I've seen many independent films and this one is the worst I've seen yet based upon being suggested to me.  I was bored within the first 10mins and the film didn't get any better as it progressed.  I think this move is for a very specific taste and not for a general audience.,1391472000,,551,4.435643564356436

8266726,5,B0017OKC7O,"I have used this film as an introduction to Seattle and some Native American culture, especially how mainstream white culture tends to 'run over' the minority cultures.  I would highly recommend it.  It's well done and funny.",1376438400,,225,5.054054054054054
