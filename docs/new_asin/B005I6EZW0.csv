8474308,3,B005I6EZW0,"Actually if I could give 2.5 stars I would.  This production is of very poor quality.  In fact it even starts off by saying the interview you see is not the interview you are hearing due to technical difficulties.  While the video of the interview plays, what you hear is some reading Kent Moyer's interview from another time.  So really there is very little new material here, and the video quality is at best average, and that is being generous.  The only thing that saves it from a lower rating is the the performances of Kata and the extra exercises and San Dan Gi, none of which are explained mind you but it good to see some the top students perform them.

Overall I would say save you money, There really isn't much here that isn't available elsewhere in a higher quality.",1428105600,,779,4.450704225352113
8474309,4,B005I6EZW0,This cd will allow one to remember one of the GREAT Goju-ryu senseis in history. It is nice to see his dojo and listen to the old interviews. One will get some insight into what was happening at the time in karate.,1368144000,,214,4.119047619047619
