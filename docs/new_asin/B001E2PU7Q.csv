3545551,5,B001E2PU7Q,My niece and nephew love this DVD series. It's real construction site footage (or whatever the DVD topic is) with voiceover giving the equipment personalities.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT!,1282089600,,178,5.592592592592593
3545552,3,B001E2PU7Q,"This is our first mighty machines video and we were a little disappointed.  It moves slowly and the sound of the machines is muted quite a bit so my son loses interest easily, even though he is a complete nut for any kind of truck, tractor, or airplane.  We'll probably try another mighty machines, hopefully it will be better, but we may need to look for another maker if they are all similar.",1272672000,,394,4.383561643835616
