805042,5,6304132336,"Just one sarcastic line from the episode ""The Die is Cast"" should reveal the great writing this series had: ""Ohhh, your going to torture me!!..oh how I've been dreading this!""
Superior action, great effects and brilliant storytelling with masterful acting made the 3rd thru 7th season, Star Trek at its highest.  Unfortunately the 7th season was a little off on the anticipation (mainly after the series pinnacle 6th episode of season 6 ""The Sacrifice of Angels"".  Season 3 starts with a bang and ends with one too.  The Dominion plot grabs ahold of the viewer and brings in a sense of total mystery and intrigue that eventually comes full-circle and then some throughout the series' run.  The third season truly began with the second season's final episode ""The Jem-Haddar"", and with the Dominion story arc that would grow into the war arc so many would follow, DS9 excelled at being able to produce independent stories that would capture the true nature of sci-fi forever.  Now we can only hope DS9 gets its long deserved big screen treatment as the only Trek series meant to be on it.  Bring on the Dominion!",1047168000,10,1111,4.790575916230367
805043,4,6304132336,"With the Dominion threat,and the introdution of the battleship,Defiant,DS9's third season was finally coming into it's own.
 Along with more character development in the lead as well as the supporting cast(Garak,Dukat,Kai Winn,Rom & Nog),the writing was even stronger than before with great episodes such as House Of Quark,Civil Defense,Second Skin,Visionary,Past Tense,and Explorers. Also introduced in this season are Leeta,Ishka(""Moogie""),Brunt,Shaakar,and Lt. Commander Eddington.
 Unfortunately with Star Trek Generation hitting the big screen,and Star Trek Voyager's big premire,DS9 was lost in the shuffle. But it would use it's underdog status to emerge as the greatest Trek series the following season.",1046908800,6,711,6.244897959183674
805044,5,6304132336,"The third season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was a pivotal one in the series. The groundwork for the series was finally laid, and the show finally moved from a TNG-picaresque storytelling style to a true story arc, when we finally get the first taste of the storytelling that would make Deep Space Nine a truly great show.
The season begins with The Search, which formally introduces the Dominion, a powerful empire led by 'changelings' with anymosity for the 'solids'. The episode also features the Starship Defiant being introduced to the station, thus altering the dynamic of the series drastically, and some reticent fans who didn't like the idea of a show about a space station finally jumped on board. There are exciting action episodes, such as Defiant and Civil Defense, a time travel adventure in Past Tense with gentle social commentary, and an astonishingly good Garak two-parter (Improbable Cause, The Die is Cast). Life Support features the departure of Kira's love interest with dignity and honor, and Explorers is the kind of warm character-based story that the show could never make enough of. Also highlights include a trip back Through the Looking Glass and the genuinely suspenseful The Adversary, which has Sisko promoted to Captain, continues the storyline of shapeshifters infiltrating Alpha Quadrant civilizations, and the drama of Odo killing one of his own.
Once again, the acting and character development are exemplary. Sisko becomes interested in Bajoran history, which indicates a possible growing comfort with his unwanted role as the planet's spiritual leader. Jeffery Combs is indespensable as both the antipathetic Brunt and the ingratiating, pleasant Weyoun, the Dominion's mouthpiece. Odo goes through the most turmoil in this season, learning of and turning his back on his people, being constantly frustrated on his affections for Major Kira, and finally killing another shapeshifter. All of this angst is pulled of admirably by Rene Auberjonois. Garak finally gets a storyline revolving around him, and it turns out to be the best two-parter that DS9 ever produced. All of this sets the scene for the rest of the series.",1046390400,37,2160,5.191977077363897
805045,5,6304132336,"A number of things happen in the 3rd season, Sisko is promoted to captain; Will Riker's makes an appearance, the Defiant is introduced, and we learn a little more about the Gamma Quadrant.

805046,5,6304132336,"Dear Amazon Customers,
One of the most exciting series of Star Trek returns for it's third season. That series being Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Now in its third season, the show begins to take on a sense of maturity and adventure not before attempted in previous Star Trek universe programs. It is at this time that Star Trek: Deep Space Nine defines itself as a different type of show from predecessor Star Trek programs.
In the third season, we see Benjamin Sisko played by ""Avery Brooks"" take on more of the role as the father to Jake Sisko played by ""Cirroc Lofton"". The bonding of these two characters adds a level of domestic humanity to a character typically positioned in previous Star Trek programs as strong, overbearing and in command of matters. Even though Commander Sisko has a duty to Starfleet, he recognizes his duty as a father to his son.
Another aspect not seen in previous Star Trek programs is the introduction of a dominant antagonist force. In this case, the group that calls themselves the Dominion is introduced to the series. For the first time, the Federation faces an adversary that is just as determine to gain power through universal conquest instead of through peaceful negotiations. It is this theme that is the center point for rest of the entire Star Trek: Deep Space Nine series.
In the third season, the audience is treated to a full interaction of all the characters. We see Quark played by ""Armin Shimerman"" not only take on the rest of the cast of characters in a fierce stance to show Ferengi ingenuity and free enterprise but also takes on the Ferengi commerce structure and it's leaders in order to maintain his way of life.
We get to see Jadzia Dax played by ""Terry Farrell"" challenge her own society and herself with concept of Trill cohabitation with the symbiont life forms they carry inside of their bodies. Jadzia wanting to live her own life is tormented by the past lives of her previous symbiont's Trill host. This aspect of these multiple lives of the character Jadzia Dax becomes one of the most challenging story developments of the series.
Along with all of the character elements being developed in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, we see the reappearance of the warlike race known as the Klingons. In the third season, the Klingon society is challenged by the concept that their system may not as equitable to all of those who show strength. We see that even other alien races can teach the proud Klingons something about their society and themselves as well.
One of the most challenging aspects of to the Star Trek universe was made in the third season with the introduction of the armored and warlike starship vessel called the ""Defiant"". In all previous and future Star Trek universe programs, the Federation has insisted that they were a peaceful organization. With the introduction of a true war vessel, this notion was forever shattered. This single aspect alone pushed the writers of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine into areas of themes and plots never before explored in the Star Trek universe.
The bringing together of all these elements lead to a masterful piece of SCI-FI entertainment that is viewable over and over again. The only way you will know for yourself is by purchasing Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 3 on DVD. Watching the culmination of the previous seasons plots come together in the third season makes season 3 on DVD well worth watching. You will surely enjoy viewing Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 3 on DVD.",1045267200,11,3490,4.751235584843492
805047,5,6304132336,"This was a very good episode.  Odo is one of my favorite characters and this was the first to revolve around him.  You got to learn a little about his past in this episode.  ""A Man Alone"" is a good episode.  I would recommend it to all my friends!",974419200,2,247,3.979591836734694
805048,2,6304132336,"I am torn by this episode. On the one hand, I thought it was a typically poor first season episode. Yes, setting up plot is important. But this just bored me to tears... On the other hand. there were some good Odo scenes here...
Ibudan is a Bajoran recently released from prison. He was in for killing a Cardassian, so the Bajorans let him out. He however has a past with Odo. Odo and Ibudan get into a scruff at Quark's, then less than an hour later, Ibudan is murdered during a  holosuite session. Too bad... he was really getting it on with that funky looking alien chick. Oh well.
Odo pretty much is targeted as the main suspect, and  has to be taken off of the case because of the conflict of interests. Soon, Odo is pretty much ganged up on in the promenade. Lynching mob, rock throwing, etc etc...
The mystery is solved with the help of Bashir, etc etc... Basic DS9 problem solved in 40 minutes.  This was just plain old uninteresting...
Honestly, this should get only one star. But there are a few great scenes here, not to be missed. First involves the nasty Bajorans sitting at Quark's bar. All too often we see Bajorans depicted either as peace loving saints, helpless victims, or righteous freedome fighters. This episode shows them in a different light. They have their faults too... and they are not all so nice...
I also like the way Odo was portrayed in these early days. Odo is still trying to figure out how to handle himself now under Starfleet's command. He still wants to use the swift hand of justice, allowable under Cardassian rule, but now frowned heavily on. He is very frustrated, and quite honestly, has a really neat and sharp edge to him in these first episodes. His relationship with Quark is fun... not this back and forth bantering, but real distrust and hatred. Pure and simple. He also has some authority issues going on with Sisko, which is interesting to see.
The other interesting thing was the way that the writers played with the episode's title in some of the subplots. Or at least I think they were playing with it... While ""A Man Alone"" probably refers to Odo, it may also refer to Bashir in his loneliness as he persues Dax. Either way, I thought it was fun to watch that...
This was not the best DS9 has to offer. But it's there...",970790400,4,2276,4.4795180722891565
805049,2,6304132336,"The first season of DS9 featured several episodes dedicated to each specific character, this one went to Odo. It's slow, boring and solid - the  exact opposite of the Odo we love and adore.",966643200,,189,4.5588235294117645

805923,5,6304132336,After finishing Star Trek: TNG (The Next Generation) series on Amazon I was looking for something else in this type of show to watch. I had grown up with TNG and it was a favorite of mine. I remembered seeing some of these episodes but didn't remember much of the characters or stories. I am almost done with season 5 now and have been very interested in watching these as an adult. The lore and information from TNG follows through to this show easily. I was very surprised to see similar characters interact between worlds but it was a nice surprise. (Luxawana Troi and Worf). The comedic relief of Quark is one of my favorite aspects of this show. I intend to continue watching more in the Star Trek world after finishing this series. Very pleased that Amazon also offers closed captioning on these shows - however there was no extra information or trivia like on Star Trek TNG when playing through a mobile device.,1459209600,,918,4.569696969696969

806804,2,6304132336,"The original; series was best in my opinion, and the next generation was 2nd best. The next generation had more of the crew members acting more like adolescents who played a lot of games. Deep Space Nine increased this tendency greatly. They even took time out to play games when war with the Dominion was eminent. Star Trek was always soft SF, but Deep Space Nine went more strongly to the comic book realm than the others, the original series was the moist serious though. A symbiotic being in my opinion is far fetched, but I know is more popular in Comics. The closest thing to this in other SF is were a hostile being takes over people such as in the Puppet Masters. The idea of intelligent dual life evolving naturally is just to far fetched outside of the Comic Book Realm.  The same goes for a liquid being. The whole idea of evolution is Survival of the fittest, Mutations creating differences, and the Natural Selection choosing the best by survival, the weaker more ineffective die off. This basic theory on which the show is based does not work on Odo at all. If you could get a chemical compound to mutate and change shape this fast it would be formidable. When Natural Selection comes into play faced with a Smart Odo, and with a less intelligent Odo it would have no reason to select the smarter. By the Theory it would make these choices long before much intelligence would develop anyway. The smarter creatures are carnivores and omnivores. They need more intelligence to survive. Apes and Pigs which are smarter animals are Omnivores, not Herbivores. Odo as an intelligent creature I just can't buy, the character belongs in Comic Books, or in Fantasy as a Warlock or some kind of magical creature.",1437696000,,1716,4.644736842105263

Season 3 keeps up the pace of Deep Space 9

This is the season where the DS9 crew gets the USS Defiant so they are a little more mobile and can travel away from the station with ease. This opens the plot options up quite a bit.

There is more of the 'alternate universe' in this season, as well as the ubiquitous time travel to Earth's past story line that most of the Trek series do. (The Original Series did it, then did it again in Star Trek 4. The Next Generation visited 1980's San Francisco, then visited 21st Century Earth in First Contact. And now DS9 does it. It's tradition!)

You get a more complete vision of Odo in this season too as his character starts to get some depth.

DS9 is a solid sci-fi series. It's got the best overall story arc of the entire Trek franchise. And being based on a station rather than a star ship sets this installment of Trek aside and makes it unique in the Trek universe. If you're either a Trek or general sci-fi fan you owe it to yourself to check out DS9. Start from the beginning though. Don't start at season 3.",1430352000,,1063,4.227722772277228

Thus the introduction of the USS Defiant.

Trek lore is stretched a bit as the Defiant has a Romulan Cloaking Device, with no explanation as to why they just didn't get a Klingon one (who are Federation allies).  We have a ship which is hyped as being ""the most powerful warship in the alpha quadrant"" yet will rarely will show it in latter episdoes.

Fans do like the Defiant itself, but overall didn't fit with the theme of Trek or the established lore of DS9.  It's telling that from Season 3 on, the better episodes are the ones involving the Defiant and not the station the show is named after.",1395446400,,766,4.442857142857143

807814,5,6304132336,"If you are a fan of Star Trek in general or DS9, this is a season that defines the developing relationships between characters. While TOS or TNG found gold in friendships or antagonistic relationships, DS9 took this aspect to a new level for TV sci-fi.

 In the third season of DS9, the writers reached a point in developing this chemistry that allowed for some of the best episodes in its seven year history. For example, the episode titled ""Explorers"" captures the close father-son relationship between Sisko and Jake. The building and flying of an ancient light propelled spacecraft is a perfect backdrop for the continued bonding between these two.

 In a parallel story-line, ""Explorers"" has a scene between O'Brien and Bashir that defines their relationship that began as antagonistic in the first season, and then moved to friendship. In a drunken stupor, the two are singing ""Jerusalem"" and discussing the realities of life. It is one of the funniest and most memorable moments in the series.

 While seasons 4-7 continue to build on these themes, season 3 is where DS9 gained a foothold in becoming the best of the Star Trek series.",1381104000,,1141,4.916666666666667

In this episode, for example, the Bajorans have put all their faith in the so-called Prophets and believe in them with all their hearts to the point of going above and beyond to appease their alleged wishes/commands. And yet some would still have the audacity, the sheer arrogance, to try and change the outcome that is supposedly *destined* to occur. Its a situation of wanting to eat your cake and still have it. Either you believe the Prophets are the ultimate, flawless forces of the universe as dictated by dogma or you don't. You cannot have both.

And, as seen in this episode, none of the actions or inactions of the characters in this episode prevented the prophesied destiny from occurring as scheduled. To say one believes in the perfection of these cosmic forces and still have the arrogance to think pitiful tiny meatbags floating in an immense cosmic ocean billions of light-years across could (or should) change things tells me they truly had no real faith at all (not that I blame them since the Prophets didn't even know organic life existed until the first episode of the series -- but that's another argument entirely).",1343347200,,1509,4.867704280155642

It's fun and light hearted and you get to see the DS9 crew and company be out of their cookie-cutter roles.

My favorite Star Treks are when they intersect our ""current time line"" or as in this episode a little past our time now. Among my other favorites being ""First Contact"" followed by the Enterprise going to the 1980's in ""The Voyage Home"", this ranks number one in my opinion.
Like I said it is too bad this was not made into a movie with a bigger budget and longer story line, it would have made a great one!
I still like Deep Space Nine for the actors and characters that made up the cast as the best of all the Star Treks done. They had a winning combination of tallent and on screen interaction that made them the best cast when compared to the others, including the original in my opinion.

Seems to me it asks how our experiences make us who we are. Jadzia has a unique opportunity to do just that by meeting her past hosts. It helps enrich the character of Jadzia Dax for future episodes. It gives us an insight to the other hosts and their personalities. It also gives Odo an insight to human benavior that he could otherwise never experience. I would have prefered that the sub story about Nog was left out entirely and give more time to explore the other personalities of Dax. This is a must watch episode if you like the Jadzia character.

The thing is, I'm sorry to say goodbye to Bareil. I like the holy man/lover role. I like occasional departures from the Dominion story line for a little breather, and Nerys deeply in love fills out her character. The side stories are interesting. Jake and Nog's friendship is evolving, and while Kai Winn is basing most of her actions on self interest as usual, she may actually accomplish some good.

I'm probably a bit nostalgic cause I saw Philip Anglim play another short-lived holy man many years before DS9 aired. He played a young priest in the miniseries ""The Thorn Birds"" in the early 80's. Anyone remember that one? It had Richard Chamberlain and Rachel Ward as star-crossed lovers in Australia.

Both the young priest in that story and our vedek gave their lives for others. Anyway, with Bareil dying, I'm like, ""Oh, not again! Give the man a break already!"" Just saying.

All the people want is for the city to give them a chance to find jobs and lead a decent life. Eventually, things get so bad, the people inside have no choice but to organize and riot. While not a direct parallel, I couldn't help but think of the situations today with Occupy Wall St. and the increasing wealth gap, along with politicians ignoring the needs of the 99%. Some of the Federation crew gets involved from an accident and throughout both episodes the questions are asked how society of this time could have let this happen. It was interesting to watch what is so close to our society and the problems we face through the eyes of the future Federation crew. This really is why Star Trek is the best.

""The Ferengi were originally meant to replace the Klingons on Star Trek: The Next Generation as the Federation's arch-rival, but viewers could not see such comical looking creatures as posing any kind of consistent threat. Thus, Paramount repurposed them as a one-dimensional nuisance, and plots involving them were usually comedic ones.

But for a Ferengi episode, it's a pretty good one.  In my opinion it's one of the few Ferengi episode from DS9 worth seeing. I like the subplot best, because this is where Sisko meets Captain Yates.

Here was my review:

The episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" from the original Star Trek series was great, because for the first time ever it explored the possibility of alternate realities. But by 1994, that was very expanded upon. Even the Next Generation expanded upon it with multiverses. So why then, did DS9 put a whole storyline around this Mirror reality? I didn't really like the whole thing, and And I don't think Gene Roddenberry would have either.  I'm going to have to sit through more of these.  The cast seems to be having a good time playing different roles. But I don't think this episode as relevant to anything.

And it stands with this one.  To be fair, this episode is better and more exciting because it's Sisko, and we do get to see more of his deceased wife, Jennifer.  But I just felt bored overall.  It is my opinion that these episodes were meant as ""fillers.""  Lets get to the Dominion already!  2.5/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'",1327104000,,1122,4.72680412371134

Odo finds his home planet and connect with other changlings. Dax bears the burden of being a joined trill. Kira integrates her duties to a new Bajor with her warrior past. Quark gets married, and Sisko gets command of the toughest ship in the federation.

Long ranging plot is glacially slow in season 3. These episodes are very high quality, entertaining and well worth seeing, yet they are run-of-the-mill Star Trek Franchise Format episodes. Most episodes are self contained and few are sequentially plot driven. You could pick and choose episodes as you like out of this season and never loose the thread. All this character development is great for the following seasons where the show concentrates on a more story arc form. The shift to the arc is highly effective because of the rich character development in these early seasons.

Episodic highlights include: Episodes 1 & 2 ""The Search"" which brings Odo home. Episode 3, ""The House of Quark"" is a delightfully fun Klingon-Ferrangi cultural exchange. Episode 6 ""The Abandoned"", explores the Jem'Hadar from birth. Two-Parter 11 & 12 ""Past Tense"" is a fun Star Trek Time Travel Tale.

The crme de la crme of this season is the two-parter episodes 20 & 21 ""Improbable Cause"" and ""The Die is Cast"" which brings the intriguing and always fun Garak to center stage, a great character honed to perfection by actor Andrew J.

The 1% moan about protesters in other parts of the world affecting their ski trips as the masses are shouting in the streets for change, while the 1% fund the Neo-Trotsky group to pander and misinform. Sound familiar yet?

808269,4,6304132336,"Deep Space Nine is great space opera in every sense of the word. Characters large and small, issues religious and profane, technology overarching and absent... Deep Space Nine has it all, and more.  I really like this show, and seeing it again after so many years--and in back to back batches--only serves to shine a brighter light on the deep and continuous character development, political maneuvering, and violence that exists outside flat Earth.

And speaking of Earth, it's only now, seeing this show again, do I get a sense of how bored I might be living on Earth in their 24th century!  With 99% of the problems solved, what's left to live for?  Maybe all that's really left is exploring (and proselytizing), and perhaps rather than being full of idealists, Starfleet actually attracts a sizeable chunk of the disaffected? Think about it: No money needed; no poverty or hunger; diseases are often surmountable, population numbers under control, etc., etc. For any Earth-born human who doesn't want to ""push papers"" or don the uniform, all the good stuff is somewhere else. We get the Starfleet senior officers or alien officials, but they're in it for the long haul, so what about everyone else?

That's where Deep Space Nine shows us more of the real life on the frontier, the lives of merchants and traders, life in the colonies, and with the Maquis. By gradually constructing a picture of the many peoples involved over time, Deep Space Nine demonstrates that although it may float in the cold black of space, it's teeming with life.",1318809600,2,1543,4.874045801526718

808271,5,6304132336,"With the introduction of the Dominion in ""The Search,"" Deep Space Nine begins its journey as a new type of Star Trek with its focus on serial storytelling and the thematic focus on war. ""The Search"" itself certainly isn't the greatest episode, but manages to combine action with thoughtful characterization of Odo. The third season has one or two duds (""Meridian"" and ""Distant Voices""), and I thought DS9 spent too much time in the mirror universe with ""Through the Looking Glass,"" but also its fair share or really memorable episodes. Quark gets more chances to show his noble sides in ""House of Quark"" and ""Family Business."" In ""Shakaar,"" the Bajoran political situation is developed in a much more interesting way than in season 2's ""Homecoming"" trilogy. Also, Vedek Bareil receives a touching sendoff in ""Life Support"" - easily Bareil's best performance in the series. DS9 also has its first time travel episode in ""Past Tense,"" which for once uses time travel not just as a fun plot twist but as a means of exploring social justice issues like poverty and homelessness. Garak's role expands from a minor background character to a major recurring character in ""Second Skin"" and ""Civil Defense,"" where he helps save the station and crew but also subtly reveals more of his history as an Obsidian Order operative. However, season 3 will be remembered for its two part episode about the Romulan-Cardassian attack on the Dominion (""Improbable Cause"" and ""The Die is Cast""). This episode is a perfect balance between dramatic characterization of Odo and Garak and some of the best ship battles in all of Trek. It does what DS9 does best - put characters in tough situations and show them facing wrenching moral decisions.",1315094400,,1720,4.955017301038063

808312,5,6304132336,"It's the third year of Deep Space Nine, and the tides are beginning to change.  This season literally takes off with a bang, a 2-part episode titled The Search.""  The episode begins with rising tension over the possibility of a Dominion task force coming through the wormhole and engaging Deep Space Nine in battle (in Commander Sisko's absence), when a ship materializes off the docking ring, the USS Defiant under Sisko's command.  He's been given a mission, to take the Defiant on a search to find the Founders of the Dominion.  The mission is impeded by the fact that Odo has been supplanted as Dee Space Nine's chief of security (momentarily) by Lt. Commander Michael Eddington and the Defiant must fly deep into the Gamma Quadrant to talk to Quark's Dominion business partners.  After the Defiant is attacked by the Jem'Hadar near its destination, Odo and Major Kira escape in a shuttle and land on a rogue planet in a nearby nebula.  And, what do they find on the surface?  They find a lake containing Odo's people, the shapeshifters.  Odo gets to know them and experiences a microcosm of what they experience together in gelatinous form, The Great Link.  Meanwhile, other members of the Defian'ts crew think they've returned to the station separately, witnessing unbalanced peace negotiations and attempting to seal the wormhole to prevent Dominion reinforcements from coming through.  Meanwhile, as Odo is socializing with his people, Kira is looking for a way to get off the planet alone and stumbles onto a chamber with the real station crew.  Kira and Odo learn that the shapeshifters (or changelings) are the real Founders of the Dominion.  The crewmembers are apparently being probed by Jem'Hadar and one Vorta for a worst case scenario, should the Dominion attack.  Odo decides that he can't see eye to eye with his people's version of justice and demands that the Federation crew be set free.

That episode sets multiple precedents, including the danger represented by the changelings as the leaders of the Dominion who can assume other identities, Odo's estrangement from them and - later in the season - his unrequited love for Kira.  Odo's feelings for Kira first come to the surface during a visit from Lwoxanna Troi, who learns of them through her empathic abilities.  Kira, whose own lover, Bariel dies amid peace negotiations between Bajor and their arch enemy, Cardassia, is unaware of Odo's love; he keeps it concealed.  Simultaneously, Jadzia Dax is faced with two struggles involving her antecedent hosts, first when the buried memories of a murderous host named Joran come to the surface and again during the ritual ceremony when she interacts with all seven previous hosts (grafted onto the bodies of other DS9 crewmembers).  Odo assumes the role of Curzon, Jadzia's predecessor, her mentor and the dear friend whom Sisko calls ""Old Man.""  When Curzon's memories are grafted onto Odo, his shapeshifting abilities allow the two personalities to merge, and Curzon-Odo almost refuses to give the memories back to Jadzia.  When she confronts him, she learns that Curzon, who'd initially rejected her from becoming joined, only had her terminated from the program because he was secretly in love with her.  She insists on Curzon's memories returning to Jadzia so they can be together through the Dax symbiote.

Another plot thread which crops up during Season 3 involves the decision of Quark's nephew and Jake Sisko's best friend, Nog (Aron Eisenberg) to become the first Ferengi enrolled in Starfleet.  As a citizen of a world outside the Federation, he asks Sisko to be his sponsor to Starfleet Academy.  He studies hard for his entrance exams, but at the same time Jadzia is confronting Curzon-Odo, Quark (who finds the idea of a Ferengi in Starfleet deplorable) is sabotaging Nog's examination so he'll fail.  Nog's father, Rom convinces Sisko to retest the boy and threatens to burn Quark's bar if he tries anything else.  Plus, the viewers meet Quark and Rom's mother, Ishka, a cultural deviant who has as good a head for earning profit as any male and strives to challenge the Ferengi cultural norm at every turn, infuriating Quark and alienating everyone else except Rom and Nog.  Rom calls her ""Moogie,"" a nickname she enjoys but Quark considers infantile and at first refuses to use.

At the same time that Quark & Rom are dealing with their mother's dissident propensity, Ben Sisko's son Jake is proving a gifted writer and playing matchmaker for his father.  Jake knows a freighter captain named Kassidy Yates whom he thinks would click immediately with Ben.  But, he purposefully neglects to tell Kassidy that Benjamin's favorite game is baseball and to tell Ben that Kassidy's brother plays on a team from the far side of the Federation.  They listen together to a game transmission over subspace, which pleases Jake.

A key thread begun during this season is the presence of the USS Defiant.  When it is introduced in the season premire, Sisko explains that it's officially an escort vessel, when it's actually a battleship without any creature comforts.  It's a ship Sisko helped design after the Borg first invaded the Federation; it is overpowered for a ship its size.  In addition, the Romulans have outfitted the Defiant with a cloaking device, in exchange for the Federation sharing its intelligence on the Dominion with the Romulan Empire.  At first, members of the crew find the Defiant uncomfortable, but as the season progresses, they adjust and come to think of the ship as home away from home.  The ship attracts so much attention that, it is commandeered mid-season by Tom Riker, the doppelganger of William T. Riker.  Tom commands a Maquis cell and attempts to launch an assault with the Defiant on a fleet built by the Cardassian Obsidian order and rumored to be meant to eliminate the Maquis in the Demilitarized Zone.  This assumption proves false; several months later, that illegal fleet assembled by the Obsidian Order, coupled with members of the Romulan Tal'Shiar, attempt to infiltrate the Dominion and kill off the changelings, supposedly eliminating the Dominion threat.  It proves to be a trap, leading directly to the elimination of the Obsidian order and crippling the Tal'Shiar.  The repercussions felt on Cardassia would last for years.

During the season finale, Ben Sisko would be promoted to captain.  His first assignment as captain is not without challenges, as it includes a changeling infiltrator disguised as a Federation ambassador, manipulating the station crew and later impersonating other members of the crew.  Ultimately, he is overpowered by Odo, the first shapeshifter to violate a law which his people consider sacred: ""No changeling has ever harmed another.""  In time, Odo would face judgment for his decision.

Interestingly, before the series began, Avery Brook (Sisko) sported a shaved head and a beard around his jaw, but his contractual obligation forced him to regrow his hair and shave his face.  But, during the last month-and-a-half of this season, he had grown back his beard.  Beginning after the finale of this season (when Sisko is promoted), Brooks would shave his head for the rest of the series.",1313452800,,7199,5.03035413153457
808313,5,6304132336,"After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to avoid being an outright plagiarism.
One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well. In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 3 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player. The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality but is a vast improvement over the first two seasons and although there are some soft and grainy picture frames (""Meridian"" was pretty bad) they were few and far between. The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release. For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to ""upgrade"" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.

Season 3 shows a vast improvement in terms of scriptwriting and storytelling and actually stands out among the better of the seven seasons and in my opinion is the most consistently good of the seven.  We see the introduction of the USS Defiant as well as the elaboration of the Dominion storyline, some of the funniest Ferengi episodes and unlike the other seasons when you get pretty poor episodes alongside some good ones, I could hardly find a dud episode here and indeed some of the best ever episodes in the entire Trekdom are found here.  I particularly enjoyed ""Second Skin"", the Riker cameo ""Defiant"", my favourites ""Past Tense Part 1 & 2"", ""Heart of Stone"", ""Visionary"", ""The Die is Cast"", and ""The Adversary"".  There are great episodes in seasons to come but they won't consistently sustain the high quality of episodes that we get throughout the entire season as we do here.

The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine. Overall, this dvd set of season 3 of DS9 sports a good, clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.

808314,5,6304132336,"Excellent Sci-Fi series.  Full of lovable characters and villains.  Lots of action, inter-personal relationships and some humorous moments as well.",1261958400,,147,6.3
808315,5,6304132336,"Too many series start off well, only to drag a bit after the second or third season (e.g., SUPERNATURAL right now).  Even BUFFY, as great as it was, was not as good after Season three as it had been before (with the exception of the glorious Season Five).  But ST:DS9 was only getting started and peaked in its later half.  (So too did ST:VOYAGER to a lesser degree.)  The Dominion loomed more and more as a story in Season Three, beginning to drive many of the main story lines.  And relations between several of the main characters began to take shape.

One of my complaints with all of the STAR TREK series is the generally weak development of character.  If you contrast any STAR TREK series with other series that are noted for their character development like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER or VERONICA MARS or -- staying within SF -- FARSCAPE or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the STAR TREK shows are remarkable for their lack of character development.  There is definitely more development than in the STARGATE series (with the possible exception of the new STARGATE UNIVERSE, which looks like it is going to depart from the three earlier series -- and yes, there were three earlier series, one of which almost no one knows anything about).  Although I've had debates with people about characters like Jean-Luc Picard and whether they truly develop or whether they merely add details to his character without actually altering him, I can find almost no real development among the vast majority of STAR TREK characters.  (Though one has to add the caveat that there is some development in the movies, especially in someone like Spock and Data.)  The one truly huge exception are the various characters who lie just outside the human.  STAR TREK excels at characters that expand our understanding of what kind of entities can be considered persons.  It began in the original series with Spock, who was nonetheless half human.  But his half-Vulcan nature was a groundbreaking development on TV SF.  It continued with Data on ST:TNG, easily the most important TV robot (and on a sidenote, since Data virtually all artificial people on TV since Data have been cyborgs -- Data has no serious competitor as TV's most important robot, a mechanical man with no biological parts).  That series had many other characters that expanded the possibility of our understanding of personhood.  ST:VOYAGER would later have two of my favorite STAR TREK characters along these lines, the Doctor and Seven of Nine, the latter actually a real human who was trying to reclaim her personhood after having been reduced to a nonperson by being a Borg drone.  The two characters on ST:DS9 who work along these lines are Dax and Odo.  Frankly, while I liked Dax, I was never able to accept the notion of a race of people who aspired to being the host of a symbiote.  It was an interesting idea and they certainly gave it their best shot, but they never managed to make the sacrifice of one's individuality plausible.  (The only convincing depiction that I have ever encountered in SF was in the superb pair of SF novels by Hal Clement, NEEDLE and EYE OF THE NEEDLE, in which a symbiote enters a human unaware of its presence.  But there the blending was not a conscious act by the host.)  Odo is one of my favorite STAR TREK characters, not least because of the marvelous performance by Rene Auberjonois.  He, Data, and the Doctor (from ST:VOYAGER) are the three STAR TREK characters who push the boundary of the Person furthest.  Odo is especially delightful in that he has no necessary shape, except for the one that he has decided to adapt, and even that one, not terribly well.  Unlike the other Founders, he isn't able to form himself into a precise human form.  And you have to love that every sixteen hours he has to refresh himself by going to rest in a bucket.  Odo is also one of the saddest STAR TREK characters, early in the series yearning to discover others like him, only in Season Two to learn that he belongs to an imperialistic, merciless species.  His refusal to join his kind renders him a permanent exile.  And his absolute otherness means that he can find no love, even though he harbors a deep affection for Kira.  Frankly, without characters like Odo and the Doctor and Seven of Nine and Data and Spock, I probably would find little to enjoy in the STAR TREK shows.  The stories too often smack of the tales from the pulp era of SF.  But the best nonhuman -- or only partly human -- characters are a source of endless delight.

As a BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan, I would like to point out that this was the season when Ronald D. Moore, the creator of BSG, joined ST:DS9.  From Seasons three through seven, he would be one of the three most important writers on the show.  I think his documented unwillingness to tread over familiar ground helped push the series into new territory.  Plus, I always had a soft spot in my heart for him, not just because we share a last name and first initial, but because he was the one who killed my least favorite STAR TREK universe character, James T. Kirk (a character I detest largely because of William Shatner's acting, which I personally consider among the worst in the history of TV -- his acting decisions beggar the imagination).

The best thing about Season Three is that although it was quite good, it would be quickly surpassed.  The show was just beginning to find its stride.",1258243200,,5408,4.6645569620253164

Plot lines are more unique & creative for a show set on a old  Cardassian space  station orbiting newly discovered planet Bajor. If anyone ever really wants to learn about the alien race
""The Cardassians"" Season 1-3 & beyond really explores their culture & why they can be so hostile towards the Bajoran people & The United Federation of Planets in general. Learning about the new species ""The Trill"" is very interesting too. I also might add there are scenes with the Shapeshifter ""Odo"" played by Rene Auberjonois, which has very cool abilities as to having the ability to transform himself into inanimate objects in sting operations. His character is head of Deep Space Nine station security. Title:Security Chief",1256428800,,835,4.957142857142857
808317,4,6304132336,"For many fans, this is probably where DS9 got interesting - the Dominion arc got going here.  But I think that overall this season isn't much better than the underrated 2nd season, and not as strong as the final four.  Unlike the 2nd, which was uneven at the beginning but really strong near the end, this one is much more even - there are great, good and decent episodes interspersed throughout.  There are three or four duds, including the lame ""Meridian"".  And of course there are classics too - ""Visionary"", ""Improbable Cause/The Die Is Cast"" and especially ""The Adversary"". Besides the Dominion Arc, a lot of the other key threads in the show - Bajoran culture and religion, the Cardassians - get some nice exploration here.  They would also play a key role in the series' final resolution, and ignoring them as a viewer would be (in my opinion) an unfortunate judgment.

Overall, a very strong season, but if you compare it to the four that follow, merely a prelude for the great things ahead.",1251676800,,999,4.68

808396,5,6304132336,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 880 minutes, it is 4 episodes (1 Disc) less than TNG, and at least 2 Discs less than TOS. However in total, for the definitive, Star Trek collection, we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Parents respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case may be the best of the lot. The shadowy design is foreboding of a darker trek inside. The case opens to reveal the 6 discs and a collectors' DVD-ROM of a section of a model graphic of DS9 (collect all complete the computer model). The discs are held in an open (no cardboard covering) plastic flip holder like in the TOS seasons. However these collectors' boxes are being replaced by the new slim line boxes that are cheaper. These are simply a cardboard holder with four to five slim DVD case holders with 1 to 2 discs in each holder (The slim line boxes do not contain the special collectors' DVD-ROM). There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 6 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Often the bonus disc may contain the last episode or two of the season, so watch out for those. Sometimes the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, Deep Space Nine (DS9), Season three is mostly about the new war looming on the other side of the wormhole by the Dominion.

The same crew is back. DS9 is commanded by Benjamin Sisko. Jake Sisko is his son. The mysterious Odo, learning more about his species in this season, is the station's metamorphosing police constable and a Bajoran operative. Doctor Bashir is the Starfleet doctor and Chief O'Brien is chief engineer. Quark is a Ferengi host who owns a casino and bar. Major Kira is Sisko's first in command, and a Bajoran. Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax is a Trill woman (and a long term friend of Sisko) assigned by Starfleet as technical advisor. Gul Dukat is a leading Cardassian. The mysterious Cardassian Garak reveals more about who he truly is.

Season Three of DS9 is mostly about the Dominion, Klingon marriage, Trills, memory implants, Jem'Hadar, auto destruct, dimension shifting, Will Riker, Bajoran celebrations, time travel, life support, love, joint science projects, rules of acquisition, psyche, parallel universes, war, ships, Ferengi laws, resistance and shape shifters.

Best episodes are Improbable Cause, The Die is Cast, The Abandoned, Civil Defence, Destiny and The Adversary. DS9 Season three has lots about the new threat of the Dominion and many of the stories are very interesting. One of the new directions this season goes in is with the Defiant ship which allows the crew of the DS9 to leave the space station and travel more into deep space. This means DS9 looses some it's `hotel in space' criticisms and does more trekking.  The end of season three sets the stage for a revelation about what the Dominion have been up to all along. Season four looks like it may be a paranoid year for Starfleet.",1209945600,,4420,4.661538461538462
808397,5,6304132336,"What's not to like? From the days of its infancy, the Star Trek franchise has managed to maintain a unique blend of highly imaginative adventure, the hallmark element of the genre, and also a general sense of optimism about the future of the human race, a feature that is somewhat rarer among ""competitors."" The skilled combining of fun and effects and the periodic insertion of political/social commentary in disguise make Star Trek Deep Space Nine just as enjoyable as its sibling series.",1208736000,,490,4.987804878048781
808398,3,6304132336,"Following up on the wonderful pilot, ""Emissary"", and the not so bad ""Past Prologue"", A Man Alone feels a little too relaxed.  With a murder investigation, a troubled wife of Chief O Brien, and continuing tensions between crewmembers, the episode shows promise but never gets things too exciting.

The investigation of Odo for the murder of the Bajoran he dislikes so much was not too thrilling, though it did have an unexpected outcome, yet nothing all too great.  I think I enjoyed the struggle between Miles and his wife Keiko, both trying to raise a family the best way they can on the station.  Keiko feels useless, and noticing young boys without any direction on the station (such as Jake Sisko and the Ferengi ""Nog"") she demands to begin a school on the station.  Not enough screentime was devoted to this unfortunately, as it was a backseat story to the investigation.  We also get some glimpses of the Julian and Dax characters interaction - mainly Julian's crush on the female trill.

Definetly not an episode for action, this is only about story and character relations.  I could pass on the investigation story, and its basically left with some ok character interaction, but that's about it.

We learn just how smart the Dominion is and a possible future in the misleading The Search. Normally I would call episodes like Fascination a waste of time but something about Avery Brooks' fine direction made it enjoyable. It could be called the DS9 Christmas Special with unlikely romances coming right and left. We learn more about Dax through Equilibrium and Facets and the hilarious episode Prophet Motive where Quark meets the Prophets. It is sort of a parody of the encounter that Sisko had in ""Emissary."" If the season had any weak points, it would of have to have been Meridian, Explorers and to some extent, Family Business.

There are a lot of series changing episodes and episodes plant seeds that prop up later in the series.

This is a Federation warship designed to combat the Borg.

The characters are totally fleshed out to make them seem like old friends. Aliens abound and are developed further. Gul Dukat is a likeable villain, Garek is focused upon in this season making him my favorite character, the entire Cardassian plot line becomes more intricate and complex.

808491,5,6304132336,"Nominated for 28 Emmys, including several for Outstanding Visual Effects, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), the first Star Trek series spin-off of the original, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine foreshadowed additional spin-offs - Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of ""exploring strange new worlds""...

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of ""shapeshifters"" who lead the Dominion's united front. Together with the rest of the crew aboard Deep Space Nine, they struggle with internal and external conflicts that threaten to destroy their very way of life...

The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Search"" in which Sisko makes an effort to strike a peace accord with the Dominion. But the peace deal fails when the Defiant is attacked by the Jem'Hadar and the ship is left immobilized. Meanwhile, Kira and Odo are stranded in their spaceship... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Abandoned"" in which Odo tries to raise and modify the behavior of an orphaned Jem'Hadar child, and ""Visionary"" in which exposure to radiation enables O'Brien to travel forward into the future where he envisions a dire future for Deep Space Nine...

He finds them, and in the tradition of all good storytelling, the fulfillment of his lifelong desire creates personal complications as well as unleashing an interstellar war that provided some of the best TV moments.

Let's see...we had angst over Odo and Kira.  No Bashir romance this season until Leeta at the end.  No Worf yet.  ""Distant Voices"" added depth to Dr. Bashir.  In case no one has picked up, Dr. Bashir is my hero.  I also adore Garak, the Q of the series, and his ""Improbable Cause"" and ""The Die Is Cast"" added increasing fascination with this morally ambiguous character to whom jillions of Web pages are devoted.

Sisko became more comfortable with his Emissary role and Kira  kicked Cardassian butt as well as putting the ever-marvelous Kai Winn's nose even more out of joint.  However, ""Life Support"" has to be one of the all-time worst episodes in any ""Star Trek"" series.  Even then, the Kira scene at the end confessing her love for Bareil because ""you were at peace with your confusion,"" Bashir's confrontation with Kai Winn (""And Doctor, I won't forget what you've said here today.""

 The accent colour for this box set is a deep green, which looks really out of place next to the red and sickly green on the first and second seasons. I'm not exactly sure why they chose the colours they did, but I would guess they have a reason.
 The episodes in this season are interesting, the storyline really start to heat up.

The series had been criticized as not having enough action, especially when compared to TNG.  Conflict needed to be introduced and it was on many levels.  The on-going quest of Odo to find his own people was addressed and expanded to incredible levels.  Kira was forced to face her beliefs about her faith, her people and herself.  We learn more about the Ferengi and their culture as Quark and him family struggle to evolve with its changes.  Sisko deals with changes in the Federation, the Bajoran and his own family.  O'Brien faces his own mortality and the ever present conflict in his own family.  Jadzia lays to rest her past lives and Bashir enters into new relationships. And those are just the main characters!
The Federation itself recovering from the recent assault by the Borg, and trying to maintain uneasy relationships with Klingons, Romulans and Cardassians now is becoming aware that threats exist from the Dominion.
The groundwork is laid for upcoming seasons including the format of story lines building over a series shows in arcs.  The on-going themes already established by this series of making the characters more multi-dimensional than either TOS or TNG by incorporating more of their lives into the story is continued and expanded as are the mirror universe and time travel premises.
The additional features include about 45 minutes of interviews with the producers, writers, actors and others focusing on certain aspects of the show or particular episodes.  The 'hidden files' (I found 7) are segments about 2 minutes each appear to be snippets from the interviews but are well worth the effort to access them.",1073779200,4,1953,4.960122699386503
808550,4,6304132336,"Although the premise behind Deep Space Nine was that of a run-down space station at the edge of nowhere, by the middle of the second season, life seemed to be getting a little too easy for the crew of the station.  Not to say that they didn't have problems, but the adversaries and adversities they faced weren't a thousand miles away from the type of troubles that beset the crew of the USS Enterprise.  But the end of the second season of Deep Space Nine changed all that.
For almost two years, the wormhole had been attracting all sorts of relatively positive attention towards the station.  Scientists, explorers, and Ferengi business were all attracted to this spatial oddity in hopes of furthering their own interests.  But in the season finale to the second year, the series was completely turned around when the wormhole suddenly becomes a threat -- beyond it lies the mighty Dominion, who appear to be taking a very proactive, almost Rumsfeldian role in their ""defense"".  Suddenly, the people on the station are frightened and scared.  A Dominion attack could come at any moment.  In the third season we see Starfleet sending, not a scientific research starship, but an experimental warship, so powerful and unstable that it is almost a menace to itself.
This was the shot in the arm that Deep Space Nine needed.  Not only is this a cantankerous old space station in the middle of nowhere, but now it's a cantankerous old space station in the middle of nowhere that could come under overwhelming attack at any time.  The change in premise seemed to energize the writing and production staff.  Even the stories that do not directly involve themselves with the running story seem like a step up from the past two years.  Although Deep Space Nine hadn't been a bad series in the past by any means, we can see it developing further in this season.
As with the last two DVD box sets, the extras here are geared mostly towards the third season.  Documentaries focus on revealing the makeup ""secrets"" or unearthing the original design sketches of the various buildings and spaceships seen during this year.  There's also a special on Odo, featuring Rene Auberjonois who these days appears to be basing his look on that of Santa Claus.  Again with this set, the documentaries are on the short size, mostly five to ten minutes long (I doubt there is one over a quarter of an hour).
Season three slowly ratchets up the tension, mixing standalone episodes with stories that enhance the overall arc.  The big story and the characters are moving along nicely now, and the changes in the series fundamentals gave the producers and writers some great new potential for stories in the future.",1068854400,5,2685,4.76889848812095
808551,4,6304132336,"For the first two season, one of the critical barbs thrown at the show was this series was not living up to Roddenberry's idyllic setting of no conflict with the peoples of the Federation. And that because DS9 was set in one location and the stories had to come to them instead of the crew going out ""where no one has gone before"", that the late creator would be saying all of it was wrong. So of that was true, as most of the key demographics -young males -felt DS9 did not measure up to TNG -especially in the action and excitement department. And while Odo and Quark where by far the most popular characters, most felt Sisko was too low-key and by being that way, viewers were not embracing the political and religion stories on the whole.
And because of the events in the season two finale, ""Jem'Hadar"", the crew were going to need more than three runabouts to stop a possible invasion from the Gamma Quadrant. The arrival of the Defiant solved two problems off the bat. The ship would be give the crew the chance to travel beyond the space station, and with the ever-increasing threat from the Dominion, it would ramp up the action quotient.
""The Search"" introduced us to the Defiant and the Founders, the rulers of The Dominion. And, surprise, they turn out to be Odo's people. The two-part episode revealed much of Odo's past and it began to set up the conflict that would become so much part of the series in later years.
Highlights of the season included the opener, ""The Search"" to be followed by ""The House of Quark"", ""Second Skin"", ""The Abandoned"", ""Defiant"", ""Past Tense, parts 1 & 2"", ""Improbable Cause"", ""The Die is Cast"", another journey to the mirror universe in ""Through the looking Glass"" and ""The Adversary"".
Along the way, even the episodic episodes began to take on the running story of the Dominion. Quark and his Ferengi family, while used as comedic results, grew deeper, becoming something TNG never could do, make them interesting.
And unlike its sister series, DS9 never really ended on a big cliffhanger. As a matter of fact, it liked to leave you on a more threatening note. The final lines delivered by Odo -the last words from a dying changeling Odo killed in self-defense -left you feeling that a large conflict with the Dominion was coming.
""He said 'you're too late, we're everywhere'""",1068768000,4,2320,4.64720194647202
808552,5,6304132336,"Season Three is a great season, with only a few mediocre episodes (Meridian & Fascination).
My favourite episodes are (in no particular order):
- THE SEARCH 1 & 2 (Odo meet his ""family"")
- THE HOUSE OF QUARK (very funny)
- SECOND SKIN (Kira's worst nightmare comes true)
- CIVIL DEFENSE (The look on Dukat's face halfway through the episode is priceless)
- DEFIANT (Tom Riker (from TNG's ""SECOND CHANCES"") steals the Defiant)
- PAST TENSE 1 & 2 (Great drama, great acting)
- VISIONARY (I always like stories dealing with time travel)
- DISTANT VOICES (A very surreal episode)
- THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS (another mirror universe adventure. The Mirror Kira is one of my favourite characters)
- IMPROBABLE CAUSE/THE DIE IS CAST (Great acting by Andrew Robinson and Ren Auberjonois (Garak & Odo)
- FACETS (We ""meet"" all of Dax's former hosts, including Curzon)
- THE ADVERSARY (a very claustrophobic episode with a surprise ending)
The extra's are all in the same league with those of season 1 & 2, with a feature on the Dominion, ODO'S CREW DOSSIER, MICHAEL WESTMORE'S ALIENS and several hidden files.
If you are a fan, as I am, you will already have bought this. If you are not, you will soon be if you buy it.",1068422400,4,1209,4.654205607476635
808553,5,6304132336,"The series really began to stretch it's wings here. For the first time, they were the only Star Trek series on the air. Everything seemed focused on bringing this together. Until mid-season when ""Voyager"" debuted on UPN. Fortunately, the DS9 producers stayed on track here.
The introduction of the experimental fighting ship, Defiant, gave the series a new energy and allowed them to get off the station more. The external threats became greater as a Klingon presence grew, and the Cardassians were rattling their sabres a bit more as well.
All in all, a wholly satisfying season which propelled us headlong into what would be the remaining hallmark years for the series.",1064534400,,671,5.0
808554,5,6304132336,"Season 2 of Deep Space Nine was an exceptional season and slightly better than the first but Deep Space Nine started busting out of the television set in this season with surprises from start to finish. The season itself is far better than the other two thanks to Season 2's set-up in ""The Jem'Hadar."" When that show premiered science fiction changed. Star Trek was about to become more epic than ever. Babylon 5 had been a show toying with the idea of an epic storyline but Deep Space Nine set it in stone for the television set. Starting out with the ""Search Parts I and II"", Deep Space Nine set us up for a season of thrills like no other.
Season 2 sometimes had me guessing the future because of its common similiarities to season 1 though they were still enjoyable. Season 3 began to change the look and feel of Deep Space Nine before it would be renovated for the future in Season 4. Season 3 is action-packed but also very character driven which is a part of science fiction I like. After the revealing ""Search"" we have four straight episodes of strong character development for Quark, Dax, Kira, and Odo. After that we have a little bit of engaging filler episodes including an exceptional one called ""Defiant"" with Jonathan Frakes starring as his ""brother"" Tom Riker. After an interesting episode with Lxawana Troi of TNG fame Season 3 hits its stride with some of the most outstanding episodes they ever did. ""Past Tense parts 1 and II"" are the best of the season and do a fantastic job with social commentary and showing how heroic Sisko is and how insecure but heroic Bashir can actually be. Not long after that Kira and Odo are built to higher levels of characterization as well as the other best episodes, ""Visionary"", ""Distant Voices"", ""Explorers"", and ""Shakaar."" The season ends with a huanting and ""Das Boot"" like atmosphere in the suspcious based episode ""The Adversary"". The season as a whole is a addictive force of nature that in one box set will be consumed quickly. Season 3 broke new ground and said to the world that Star Trek is not just Vulcans and Klingons...we can stretch.
  The DVD is fair in its special features, not growing much from season to season. The interview with Rene Auberjonois is pretty interesting but is too footage heavy. The section 31 files are smaller in number this time around but the featurette on Explorers is very cool and is best when watched after or before viewing the episode.
  This is a great buy and is, thus far in the series, the best set of episodes Star Trek had ever made for Deep Space Nine AND the Star Trek universe.
""WE ARE EVERYWHERE!""",1061596800,2,2608,4.590128755364807
808555,5,6304132336,"Season 3 of DS9 contains a plethora of standout episodes, with just a few weak spots (e.g., 'The Abandoned', which was too reminiscent of TNG's lone Borg story; or 'Heart of Stone' which had the silly Kira rock A-story that was overshadowed by the Nog B-story) scattered about.
DS9 was at its best when telling bold specific stories, and not just formula Star Trek stock tales - here in Season 3, there is a lot to admire, enjoy, and appreciate.
We are introduced to the destroyer Defiant. A cherished Bajoran supporting character (Bariel) is lost in 'Life Support', while a powerful new Bajoran 'Shakaar' is later introduced. Garak makes several intriguing appearances, with the two-part Enabran Tain storyline ('Improbable Cause/'The Die is Cast') being particulary compelling. An excellent crossover story 'Through the Looking Glass' has Sisko interacting with the mirror Jennifer. Louise Fletcher's performance as the insidious Kai Winn is magnificent to behold. 'Past Tense' parts 1 and 2 confronts the difficult homeless social dilemma. 'Second Skin' puts Kira in a Cardassian's shoes. And Jonathan Frakes appearance in 'Defiant' is yet another nice touch.
The Dax centered 'Facets', where she is able to meet her former hosts, was a great idea and it is certainly an interesting episode. However, it would have been much better if fleshed out into a two-part storyline.
The excellent 'House of Quark' is one of my favorite episodes of the year. 'Explorers' is a wonderfully poignant episode that really hit home with me. And things start and finish with a bang! with Odo episodes 'The Search' and 'The Adversary'.
The list of highlights can go on and on.
On the DVD, notice that the Defiant replaces the shuttlecraft in the menu sequence. Also note that episodes 466 and 465 are intentionally out of order because that's the way they were broadcast to accommodate the Tain storyline.
Not much more needs to be said - another brilliant year for a brilliant series.",1061164800,2,1970,5.04601226993865
808556,2,6304132336,"I wasn't especially thrilled with A MAN ALONE.  Both of the main plots in this episode seemed shallow and uninspired.  There were glimmers of potential in there, but the episode eventually just takes the easy way out.
The main plot revolves around a suspicious murder on the station, of which Odo appears to be the prime suspect.  Various clues point to the constable: he had a strong motive, he had the ability, he had the opportunity, and his alibi is non-existent.  I suspect this entire plot was worked just so that Sisko could have a loud speech imploring an angry mob that they shouldn't hate or harm a man just because he's different.  Yawn.  It's not an awful idea, it's just a horrendously clich&eacute;d one.  How many thousands of times have we seen this scene before?  How many hundreds of those times have we seen this in a Star Trek episode?  William Shatner must be able to recite that exact speech in his sleep by now.
The secondary plot revolves around Miles O'Brien's wife, Keiko, deciding to open a school for the various children who live on the station.  This might have actually been quite interesting, if it had delved deeper into the questions that it raised (how to teach children of different cultures in the same class, how someone with no background in education could rise to the challenges, how to persuade the skeptical that education is not propaganda, etc).  Unfortunately, most of the solutions that Keiko must arrive at take place off-screen, so we never get more than a superficial look.
There are a handful of good moments in this episode.  I like seeing the crew getting all grumpy with each other.  Odo gets a few good lines and scenes.  It's a pity the whole thing just feels rather convoluted.",1059436800,,1734,4.698675496688741
808654,5,6304132336,"DS9's third season proved to be quite a pivotal season and a great buildup to the following seasons.  Throughout the course of the season, several questions were answered and several new ones were introduced, leading up to an instrumental and somewhat ominous season finale in which a Founder tells Odo ""you're too late, we're everywhere.""  That one sentence made for a long summer at that time, leaving fans in throes of anticipation for the fourth season.  Important developments of the third season were the addition of the Defiant, additional back stories on the Dominion and its makeup, to include finding out who Odo's people are and the series taking on a more ""serialized"" tone.
I highly recommend this DVD set, the two previous seasons and the remaining four seasons, to any and all fans of Star Trek, especially those who didn't quite give DS9 a chance in its beginning because you will find that DS9 represents some of the best Star Trek to date.
Standout episodes of the season:  (They all stand out, but space is limited)
The Search Parts I & II - As a grand conclusion to season two's ""The Jem'Hadar"" and setting up season three through seven in the ""epic"" of Deep Space Nine, these two episodes are extraordinary.  It is from this point you know as a viewer that DS9 has a sense of purpose.  Here we find out where Odo comes from and the terrible truth that revelation brings about.
The House of Quark - In this hilarious Quark episode, by a twist of fate, he becomes the head of a Klingon house.  Robert O'Reilly makes a return as Gowron, Chancellor of the Klingon Empire.  This is another brilliant Ferengi/humor episode.
Equilibrium - In this extremely compelling and captivating episode, Jadzia begins having hallucinations for no apparent reason.  Then it becomes clear that she may lose her symbiont, thus her life as well.  She finds out that she has not been told of ""every"" host the Dax symbiont has had.  The ending to episode is quite beautiful.
Second Skin - This episode epitomizes why DS9 is such an exceptional series!  Kira is kidnapped and altered to appear as a Cardassian and told that she is a deep under cover agent of the Obsidian Order.
Defiant - In this poignant and ominous episode, Thomas Riker makes an appearance, hijacks the Defiant as part of a Maquis operation and then takes her to  Cardassian territory intent on uncovering a large fleet of Cardassian warships he ""believes"" are preparing to head into the DMZ.
Past Tense Parts I & II - This two hour episode is quite possibly the most stunning and moving episode of the entire season.  Sisko, Bashir and Dax attempt to transport to Starfleet Headquarters but due to unexpected circumstances are transported to the year 2024 in the midst of one of the most crucial historical reference points for Earth and the Federation.
Heart of Stone - This fascinating episode involves Kira and Odo making their way back to DS9 but they intercept a Maquis ship and follow it down to a moon in the hopes of capturing the solitary occupant.  This episode is relatively important in lifting the vale on some of Odo's feelings.
Destiny - This episode is a perfect example of the beauty of the epic ""saga"" that is DS9 as it brings in Sisko's role as the Bajoran Emissary when the mission of trying to set up a communications array on the other side wormhole has been prophesized some three thousand years ago by a Bajoran prophet.
Prophet Motive - In this uproarious and brilliant Ferengi episode Grand Nagus Zek shows up on DS9 and he's totally rewritten the Rules of Acquisition towards a ""not for profit"" bent and Quark is beside himself with ""grief.""
Visionary - This is a brilliant O'Brien episode in which he unexpectedly finds himself time shifting around the station while at the same time, Romulans and Klingons are aboard.
Through the Looking Glass - This is another superb ""Mirror, Mirror"" episode that became a highly looked forward to annual episode of every season!
Improbable Cause & The Die is Cast - These episodes constitute two of the finest hours of Star Trek.  Garak survives what is seemingly an ""assassination"" attempt and Odo steps in to investigate.  Before long, we have the Obsidian Order, the Tal Shiar, the Jem'Hadar and Starfleet involved, setting up what will be the arc that carries this series.
Explorers - In this beautiful episode Sisko decides to build an Bajoran solar sailing vessel to prove that the Bajorans used these ships to get to Cardassia eight centuries earlier..
Family Business - This is another terrific and humorous Ferengi episode in which Quark is shut down by the Ferengi Commerce Authority because his ""Moogie"" has been earning profit and he must find a way to stop it or he'll be financially destroyed.
Facets - This brilliant episode involves Jadzia and her need to complete her ""zhian'tara,"" a Trill ceremony where her friends temporarily receive the memories of her past hosts.  This episode played wonderfully as the main characters assumed the roles of these past hosts.
The Adversary - In this exceptional season finale, Sisko is promoted to Captain and given the mission to attempt to stop a full scale war between the Federation and the Tzenkethi, or are they as they soon find that there is a changeling aboard the Defiant.  The beauty of this episode plays out in the last scene. {ssintrepid}

808657,5,6304132336,"Instead of analyzing each  season's merits or demerits I wanted to comment on the overall quality of the DS9 box sets themselves - the things that a DVD collector may want to consider when deciding on whether to purchase the sets or not - especially since these sets are not cheap.
1. Video/Audio quality - Excellent, especially compared to the Star Trek: Next Generation series. If I have one slight quibble, it's that the picture has a slightly 'hazy' quality - but this can be seen in the broadcast version of the earlier seasons too. Otherwise the colors are clean, there is no noise, and on a big-screen TV it looks excellent. The 5.1 surround sound is very nice - much better again than for TNG  - you can really hear the ships flying around/behind you in battle scenes.
2. Menus and extras - The menus have the look and feel of the control panels in Ops on DS9. A nice touch is that while on the season 1 and 2 main menu a runabout flies by, on the season 3 menu the Defiant flies by. The extras are numerous and really worthwhile, including indepth looks at individual characters, comments on special episodes, special effects/makeup, and so on.
3. Packaging - This is the one thing I am rather disappointed with. The US release of these boxes are packaged in rather cheap-looking plastic cases that look ready to split at the seams at any time. Compared to the European or Japanese releases these boxes look well, rather nasty. The redeeming feature is that the design is quite nice.
Overall however, these box sets are worth almost every penny for any Trek or sci-fi fan. Kudos to Paramount for releasing them all in one year instead of making us wait for months for each box too.",1054944000,6,1690,4.537704918032787
808658,4,6304132336,"Season 3 of DS9 is where things got really intesesting. During the first season and part of season two all the key pieces for the ensuing conflict that would continue throughout the course of the series. Like B5's Shadow War, the Dominion-Federation War, would be center stage during season 3. Sisko finally gets a ship that can hold its own against many of the Jem Hadar spacecraft. The Defiant is an ""overpowered, overgunned craft"" that providesa a way for Sisko and company to meet, greet and defeat(as well as be defeated)oncoming advesaries.
In the opening two part episode, Sisko and his crew take the Defiant into Dominion space in an attempt to discover who and where the Founders are. Unfortunately, the Defiant is taken down too easily to make the episode credible. Still, it does provide a unique glimpse into the ideal presented by Founders and the reality of their civilization as they try and seduce Odo to join them.
""Defiant"" also provides an opportunity for NextGen actor Jonathan Frakes to appear on DS9. As Riker, he charms Kira into giving him a tour of the Defiant in order to steal it. Written by NextGen writer Ronald Moore and directed by Cliff Bole, it's an interesting and intense episode well acted by Frakes.
The episodes ""Second Skin"",""The Abandoned"" and highly acclaimed two parter ""Past Tense"" (a transporter accident hurls Sisko and company across time and space to Earth during a conflict in the year 2024. A key figure of the past Gabriel Bell attempts to help Sisko and Bashir during a fight. Bell is killed prematurely thus altering history and forcing Sisko to take the man's identity to ensure the continuity of his world.
""Life Support"" provides a serious look at the ethics of artifical life support. The character of Vedic Bareil suffers from brain damage during an attempt to resuscitate him. Bashir gradually replaces Bareil's brain with implants making his contribution to peace talks possible but robbing him of his humanity in the process.
""Improbable Cause"" gives us further background on Garak. Garak chooses to rejoin his mentor Enabran Tain in a combined assault with the Romulans against the Dominion.
There are many other fine episodes during the third season worth noting. Most important, though, is the doubt cast on Odo when his relationship with the Dominion's Founders becomes clear and the introduction of a new Star Trek security chief Michael Eddington played by the Marvelously oily Kenneth Marshall.
The extras are nicely put together and all appear on the last disc in the set. The most interesting are the Birth of the Dominion and Beyond, Time Travel Files: ""Past Tense"", Sailing Through The Stars: A Special Look At ""Explorers"" and the crew dossier on Odo. The 5.1 remix on the audio gives additional depth to the episodes making them more cinematic and allows one to finally hear all the detailed sound effects buried in the stereo mix of the broadcast episodes. Unlike Season 1, Season 3 features 26 episodes and the transfers are pristine.
Although not flawless (how could they be with minor analog artifacts? and an occasinally slightly blurry look to some of the episodes), they are among the best in a well designed boxed set. The lack of a booklet providing credits and a basic outline of the plot is still a problem. I suppose Paramount figured that most folks purchased the DS 9 Companion.
 In fact, the third season transfers put the 2nd season transfers of many of the B5 episodes to shame. Obviously great care was taken and, unlike early Trek NextGen episodes, there's rarely any of the compression problems one would expect.
What's amazing (and easy to forget) is how well structured and written DS9 was; while it follows the Trek formula a little too closely at times, DS9 takes a number of risks that never occurred to the makers of the earlier Next Gen and of later series Voyage and Enterprise. I'd recommend the DS9 Companion in addition to the boxed set. Unfortunately, DS9 doesn't come with any booklets (unlike the fine synopsis in each boxed set of B5). It's hard for many fans to remember which of the cryptically titled episodes features what.
Another drawback to the boxed set is the lack of any writer/director/cast/producer commentary tracks. I would have been interested in hearing producer Michael Pillar's and writer Ira Behr's comments on the key episodes ""Past Tense 1 &2"". I'm surprised given the wealth of extras here, that Paramount hasn't sprung for two or more cast commentaries as it would make the hefty cost a bit more understandable.
I'd definitely recommend seeing season 3 prior to seasons 4 & 5 as they outline the background for those seasons and the conflicts between the characters of Eddington, Sisko, Odo and Kira. While DS9 3 isn't a perfect set, it features nearly flawless transfers with a wealth of documentary extras that will be of interest to Star Trek fans. Always the Rodney Dangerfield of the Trek family when Next Gen was on, DS9 is still among the best written and detailed series (outside of B5)created during the90's.",1054944000,16,5047,4.902923976608188
808659,5,6304132336,"Season 3 is the beginning of what became my favorite show. For those on the fence, 3 is the beginning of an epic and complex story that takes place over the rest of the series. One could get away without seeing seasons 1 & 2, only missing the introduction of the Dominion (which holds nothing crucial -but good stories nonetheless).
""Past Tense"" is a great example of how abstract and ingenious this show became. A pre-ordained time paradox where Sisko himself replaces a historical figure (who was accidentally killed as a result of the DS crew polluting the time-line) to repair a kink that ends humanity's existence in the future we know and love. There are numerous gems in this season as well as some of the best action with the Dominion. Incredibly complex stories that fall back into themselves with masterful actors on all levels. Everyone's character matures and production value starts to peak, so this is probably the box-set to start with if your not sure. Season 6 is my all time fave (especially episode: ""In The Pale Moonlight""). Enjoy.",1054598400,,1051,4.78021978021978
808660,5,6304132336,"Though its often debated when this show found its feet (3rd or 4th seasons), the inclusion of the Dominion and the increase in the more ""political"" nature of DS9 finally gave the show feet to stand on.
While the first two seasons were essentially rooted in the TNG theme of exploration, etc.  The producers finally seemed to realize that this show (because of its stationary nature) could never be anything like TNG in terms of structure - and they made a very good choice in altering the direction and giving Sisko a warship to fight with.
Some of the show's all-time best episodes are in the third season (second only to season 4 in terms of # of great ones):
The Search, Meridian, Defiant, Fascination, Destiny, Visionary, Through the Looking Glass, Improbable Cause, The Die Is Cast, The Adversary",1053907200,4,801,4.762589928057554

That's not to say that the earlier seasons aren't important or worth getting, in fact, just the opposite. To understand the complexity of the story that develops in the later seasons, one must know the story and motivations for the characters early on. I love this season, and think it is worth every cent. I think you will too. DS9 is not only the best Trek, but one of the best shows ever on television. :)",1053129600,4,511,4.389473684210526

I love the spirtuality of the Bajorans, and the alternate universe stories are some of the best Sci-Fi ever written.  Buy these DVD's, and prepare for a great adventure!",1049500800,,299,4.94

7864362,5,6304132336,"I've never reviewed anything for Amazon before.  I've been a Prime member for 7 years but just recently started using the video service.  I was beyond delighted to find DS9.  I has always been by far my favorite Star Trek franchise.  I watched all of them starting with the first run of the original Star Trek when I was a little girl.  Setting the show on a space station gave the writers so much more versatility than keeping it confined to a ship.  Now I must thank Prime for giving me the perfect way to spend my birthday.  Geeking out in front of my big screen tv, bingeing on DS9, eating chocolate cake and ice cream for breakfast lunch and dinner and refusing to answer the phone or door.  I finished season 2 and am moving on to season 3.  I'm in Trekker heaven.  Thank you Amazon for my wonderful birthday.",1517097600,,815,4.337748344370861
7864363,5,6304132336,A nice balance! The conflict with the Dominion is present but not overwhelming. The characters are fully developed. This season was fun to watch.,1510358400,,145,5.083333333333333
7864364,5,6304132336,"Garek, Odo, O'Brien, Quark, Rom, Dukak, Nog, Jake, Kai Winn, and Kira are excellent characters in Season 3. Captain Sisko is improved from the first 2 seasons, and Dr. Bashir is finally not annoying anymore. Dax remains the weak link and she has stinker episodes, but Next Generation had Troi and Beverly as two bombs, so it's no big thing.

This is an intellectual, philosophical Star Trek season, with a focus on characterization and politics. Some episodes have no or little action, which may be odd to newbies. Season 3 was not as perfect as I had remembered it, but it still deserves 5 stars on here.",1509840000,,605,4.654205607476635

7864367,3,6304132336,"You can always tell when a show starts to run out of ideas, there is alot more screaming and crying by the characters, they start to through in romance and soap opera crap, etc. DS9 is better than the crap they try to pass as Sar Trek now. I didn't like DS9 much when it came out and figured I'd give it a shot again, it's better than nothing I guess.

Too much heavy handed political and social commentary, something Gene always made sure didn't happen. Gene was a Veteran and lived an adventuours life, you can tell most of the writers, directors and producers of DS9 haven't been outside of Los Angeles thier whole lives are more concerned with making political statements than making good Trek - stick to sitcoms or soap operas. Maybe they're in league with JJ Abrams to kill Sci-Fi??

Voyager brought it back home. TNG > Original > Voyager. DS9 and Enterprise are tied.",1489881600,,874,4.490566037735849
