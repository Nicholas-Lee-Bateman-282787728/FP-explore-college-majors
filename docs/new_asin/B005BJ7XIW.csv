8464005,5,B005BJ7XIW,"What I find so fascinating about this film, is not its length, but period of time in the past.  This was a very turbulent time with unceasing warfare for a long period of time.  This film takes this and weaves web of intrigues and love for a little over two(2) hours of fascinating entertainment.  LOVE CAN HAVE GAINS AND LOSSES.  NJMJr.",1360627200,,337,4.475409836065574
8464006,3,B005BJ7XIW,"i thought by the reviews i read that this would be a much better movie than I think it is.  while it is good, it seems to break off into smaller stories so if you don't pay close attention you might loose the plot.  I have enjoyed several chinese movies much better.",1358812800,,266,4.096153846153846
8464007,5,B005BJ7XIW,Wow this movie was amazing. The scenes were breathe taking the story line just touching to the heart. I am very happy I found it on netflix and now I'm going to own it. It's must see movie.,1355011200,,189,4.0
8464008,5,B005BJ7XIW,"This is one of those movies that I prefer to Hollywood cookie cutter movies.
Another good part is that there are no flying warriors on the top of the trees.

It's a very good mix of the history, the legend, and the art.

Do not expect Bruce Lee like action scenes, or Jackie Chan's humour.

Sun Hunglei's performance as Sun Bin is outstading.

To me the only downside was the ending.
But overall, this movie is really one of the best movies that I've seen in recent years.
It definetely tops almost ALL the recent Hollywood movies.

SPOILER!
Sun bin suffered a lot. You expect him to become a tough guy, a very tough guy after all he survived. And he is a tough guy. But in the movie he commits suicide in the end (which also contradicts with the legend). I'd still had no objection IF he had been portrayed a little prone to suicide during the movie, in some other scenes. It was all of a sudden, out of nowhere.
I don't know, maybe it's how they (those who commit suicide) do that.",1327536000,3,983,4.291891891891892
