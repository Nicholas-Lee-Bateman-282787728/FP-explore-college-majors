good opening match and these two worked well together with lots of back and forth during the match. Again both guys looks good and this is a good example of how a veteran can make himself and the young guy look good cough*Cena Orton*Cough. 8/10

Sin Cara (Blue Mask/Mistico) vs Sin Cara (Black Mask/Hunico)
This could have been a smackdown match and should have been there were moments of highpaced high flying action but it also got boring at times overall it is a decent match, but nothing special. 6/10

World Tag Team Title Match: Air Boom (Evan BOurne & Kofi Kingston) vs Jack Dwagger & Dolph Ziggler
After that match this was a very welcome change of pace 4 young fantastic stars who really showcased themselves in this match. All 4 worked well in this tag match and really impressed me a really good match. 8.5/10

Hell In A Cell World Heavyweight Championship: Mark Henry vs Randy Orton
Yet again Orton helps Henry look like a credible champion to a degree and Mark is finally doing something after 15 years. A Pretty good match not fantastic but for a Mark Henry match this was good. 8/10

Intercontential Championship match: Cody Rhodes vs John Morrsion
An impropteau match that came off pretty good despite Cody wrestling in street clothes after redebuting the white IC title. While both looked good I really am looking forward to JoMo getting off this losing streak of his. A really good match overall though. 7.5/10

Kelly Kelly vs Beth Phoenix
Beth finally wins. that is all

Triple Threat Hell In a Cell WWE Championship Match: John Cena vs Cm Punk vs Alberto Del Rio
A really good match where all 3 worked well together and put on the match of the night. Everyone had really good spots in this match and the ending was really unexpected. The after match brawl was pretty good and left plenty of questions for RAW. 9/10",1317686400,,1855,4.623100303951368
4689621,4,B005G7WGVS,"The Christain-Sheamus match was a passable back-and-forth bout. The bout between Sin Cara Blue-Sin Cara Black was boring and had a lot of predictable moves. The Tag Team title match between Air Boom(Kofi Kingston & Evan Bourne)and the team of Dolph Ziggler & Jack Swagger was a pretty good tag bout with pretty good moves. The HIAC match for the World's title between Mark Henry & Randy Orton was once again a classic David & Goliath battle with Goliath(Mark Henry) winning again. The IC title match between Cody Rhodes & John Morrison was very nice for a last minute bout. The Divas title match between Beth Phoenix & Kelly Kelly was sloppy but thankfully short. The 3 way HIAC match for the WWE title between John Cena,CM Punk & Albero Del Rio was a hardcore,entertaining & smash-mouth brawl with Cena losing the title making it even that much better. The post match brawl with The Miz,R-Truth and the rest of the WWE roster was a good reminder of the WCW's NWO days back in the late 1990's. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1317513600,4,1026,4.521505376344086

8471293,3,B005G7WGVS,"This is a PAL Region 2 DVD with English, Spanish, French, and German commentary. It's the same WWE PPV American broadcast converted to PAL 50Hz, however this PPV back then was so much chaos after Vince McMahon took time off because Triple H and AJPW legend John Laurinatis had business problems in the storyline.

This PPV was acceptable as possible, Christian's rivalry with Sheamus, Kofi & Evan of Air Boom making an impact, and 2 Hell in a Cell matches for World and WWE titles. Most likely the moral of this PPV is The Miz.

I'd pass on this one, but the WWE Network is your best friend.",1427500800,,591,4.462962962962963

8471295,2,B005G7WGVS,"It's amazing what the WWE did to one of its most iconic matches. Hell in a Cell was the match made famous in the late nineties when Kane debuted and the very next year after watching Mick Foley make himself famous in one of the most gut-wrenching displays of self-abuse ever shown on television. All those memorable moments and great matches seem far in the past when viewing any of the Hell in a Cell events, of which the 2011 version may be the very worst of the lot.

Not Worth Watching: Christian/Sheamus put together a lifeless ""grudge"" match. If you ever want to see how to have a grudge-less match, here it is. Two Sin Caras battled it out for supremacy in a match the crowd obviously didn't want to see. The tag team titles match was okay, but they didn't do anything to separate it from the half-dozen free matches Dolph, Swagger and Air Boom put on around the same time.

Worth Watching: Beth Phoenix challenged for the Divas Championship for the third PPV in a row with a nice result, Cody Rhodes had an excellent performance character-wise even though his match with John Morrison was mediocre, and the Triple Threat Main event was a solid brawl between Del Rio, Cena and Punk, though it failed to live up to expectations.

Match of the Night: Mark Henry had won the World Title from Randy Orton the month before in a really good match and, though not as good as their first encounter, their Hell in a Cell match was at least better than the main event. The match still had a physicality about it that other matches lacked and Henry put in another strong performance worthy of his awesome Hall of Pain run in late 2011. Not a classic but still a worthwhile match.

The problem with this event was that not one match was more than decent and that left a general malaise over the entire event that's even worse than a poor event that has one great match. This is the sort of show you walk away from in the middle to do laundry without even thinking about it.",1405987200,2,1968,4.413223140495868

HELL IN THE CELL 2011

1. CHRISTIAN VS SHEAMUS-great opening contest here as these two work well together. Sheamus takes the early advantage but things soon turn around. That would be the story of the match as it was very back and forth. The story going into this was also told so well during the match. It really felt like these two could not stand each other as they put it on each other. The ending would come after multiple reversals with the Celtic Warrior coming out on top. Very good opening match provided by these two.

2. SIN CARA VS SIN CARA-now for some reason the fans were not into this one, beats me because I love this storyline. The action is really good here with a few missteps but still good. I have no idea why the fans are not into this since both of these guys always deliver. Of course Sin Cara Blue or one takes this one in a match the fans did not truly appreciate.

3.[TAG TITLES]AIR BOOM VS JACK SWAGGER & DOLPH ZIGGLER-I have always been a fan of tag team matches, because when they are done well they steal the show. It has been a while since tag team wrestling has been important in the WWE but this match gives me hope. This is a really good tag match as both teams have good chemistry. The action is back and forth and Vickie's team feels like the classic heel teams of old. They way they worked together here was great, still Air Boom keeps the title in a great tag match.

4.[WORLD TITLE HELL IN A CELL]MARK HENRY VS RANDY ORTON-now I for one was extremely excited when Henry won the title. That moment was so long coming and I just loved it, so needless to say I wanted him to keep it here. This match was pretty much a brawl as a lot of cell matches are. Henry really worked Orton over with his power here while Orton used the cage a lot to his advantage. A very good match with Henry thankfully keeping the strap even though it looked as if they were going to put the belt back on Randy.

5.[I-C TITLE]CODY RHODES VS JOHN MORRISON-I have to say that I loved what Cody did here, bringing out the classic I-C title and cutting a great heel promo. Love the mentions of Bret Hart, Randy Savage and them but one thing is kinda funny to me. In this match he came off like another former legendary I-C title holder, Shawn Michaels. Cody came of like classic HBK when he was in his early I-C title days in the early 90's. Such as trying to get counted out in clever ways and even trying to walk out. Any way this was a good match with both of these guys but Cody keeps the belt in a cool little quick match. Also Miz and Truth attacking Air Boom backstage happens after this

6.[DIVAS TITLE]KELLY KELLY VS BETH PHOENIX-these two have been doing a good job with their rivalry. I have enjoyed all their matches much like this one here. Of course I am always rooting for Beth and finally it paid off. Beth controlled most of the match with her power and submission attempts. Beth finally gets the title and I don't care how she got it.

7.[WWE TITLE HELL IN A CELL]JOHN CENA VS CM PUNK VS ALBERTO DEL RIO-I was really looking forward to this match as I like all three guys. The action here is excellent as all three dish it out hard but also take it. I loved the opening of the match with Del Rio trying to get away from Punk and Cena. Of course all the weapons that they used were used very well as was the cage itself. I had a feeling before this match that Del Rio was going to keep the title. It turns out I was right as Double R was able to help Del Rio win the match. But it was what happened afterwards that was the real story of the night. Miz and Truth came out and attacked all three guys, the ref, and even the camera guys. To make it even crazier they did this with someone lowering the cage so no one could get in to help their victims. I really loved this ending here and thought it was a great way to end the event.

This was a good event that keeps things moving nicely for the WWE this year. Over all it has been a good year for them, this DVD has some good special features as well. These include Mark Henry's interview from Raw, and an interview with Del Rio.",1321574400,3,4109,4.153266331658291
8471300,4,B005G7WGVS,"Before I get started, it should be noted that Jim Ross replaced Jerry Lawler on commentary for this PPV since Lawler was still out with injuries from his attack by Mark Henry.  Also throughout the night, there were various incidents involving The Miz & R-Truth (sitting front row with tickets before being escorted out the building & later attacking superstars in the locker room) who were fired from RAW after Night Of Champions.

Sheamus vs. Christian - Sheamus was in control early with Christian trying to run away before he was finally able to gain control pushing him off the top rope to the floor.  This was a very good back & forth opening match that did it's job in getting the crowd hot with both men putting in a strong performance.

Sin Cara (Blue) vs. Sin Cara (Black) - The original Sin Cara was dressed in his traditional blue while the newer Sin Cara was dressed in black which led to some humorous moments amongst the announce team throughout the match when trying to establish the difference between both men.  The early moments of the match had stalemates between both men as they were trading & countering each others moves before Blue executed a strong armdrag that took Black all the way out to the floor before executing a flip dive to the outside & an asai moonsault that didn't connect as expected.  Black was able to take to the air himself with an elevated dive over the top rope to the floor & attempted to ground him on the mat.  Blue was able to recover & go back in the air with a top rope dive to the floor & later went back the armdrag but this time from the top rope before executing a variation of a flip powerbomb.  This was a match that had his share of the lucha style with the unique high flying moves but the crowd didn't really seem to connect with the crowd when they tried to wrestle in the ring as it got some ""boring"" chants but I enjoyed the match.

WWE Tag Team Champions Air Boom vs. Jack Swagger & Dolph Ziggler - Before the match, I couldn't help but laugh at the joke Michael Cole got in regards to how stupid the name ""Air Boom"" is.  Air Boom was in control early with their quick tags & teamwork over Dolph Ziggler.  Swagger was able to regain control with his power advantage while both men did double teaming of their own such as holding the ropes causing Kofi to fall through them, cheating whenever the referee had his back turn, and working over one member while keeping him away from his partner.  With teams not being a tag team for a significant amount of time, each worked well here in a good back & forth match.

Hell In A Cell Match: World Champion Mark Henry vs. Randy Orton - Orton took the fight right to Henry from the start & used the cell right away by ramming Henry into it various times.  Henry used his power advantage by focusing on Orton's arm & used the ringpost to work it over, gave Orton a receipt & rammed Orton into the cell, executing various running powerslams in & out of the ring, and wearing down Orton with the bearhug.  Orton was able to use the cell to his advantage when Henry attempted a World's Strongest Slam on the steel steps & giving a DDT on those steps before using the ringposts to his advantage & before pulling out all his signature moves on Mark Henry in an attempt to win.  I've stated time & time again that Mark Henry is very limited in what he can do but this was the best match I've seen from him in a long time as the stipulation helped out the match very well with the way they used the cell & steel steps to add to the story of the match.

Intercontinental Champion Cody Rhodes vs. John Morrison - Cody came out in his street clothes with for a special announcement in that he bagged the current belt in favor of the classic design before it was announced that he would defend the title against Morrison.  Morrison was in control the point where Cody tried to walk out of the match & even held on to the ringpost just so we would get counted out.  Cody was able to recover with both men going back & forth throughout the match in a very well done performance for both men where it was only one mistake that cost a victory.
As a side note, you may want to put the match on mute as Booker & Cole started to get out of hand bickering that Ross had to stay something & remind them that a match was going on in the ring.

Divas Champion Kelly Kelly vs. Beth Phoenix - This match was the same setup as their previous encounters with Natayla & Eve being in their partner's corners.  Kelly went after Beth with Thesz Presses & punches & forearms before Beth was able to recover & heavily focus on Kelly's with various blows to the area such as elbow drops, dropkicks, punches, and stretches.  Kelly kept attempting to beat Beth the way she did before with quick rollups & able to hit some moves but Beth kept working over her while Natayla took care of Eve on the floor before taunting Kelly & getting involved herself finally allowing Beth to gain the championship.  This was my favorite of their series which were definitely the best series of diva matches this year but stay tuned afterwords as both Beth & Natayla got emotional over the win.

Hell In A Cell Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. C.M. Punk - Knowing that he was the odd man out in this situation, Del Rio tried to run away from both men but really had nowhere to hide causing both men to beat him down & eventually kept shoving the other out of the way just to stomp on Del Rio.  There were various moments throughout the match such as Punk's way of breaking up Cena's attempted Attitude Adjustment on Del Rio on the outside, Punk being shoved into the cell various times including once that caused his back to get cut, the various involvement of a steel chair including how Del Rio used it during a top rope move onto both Punk & Cena, Cena's top rope legdrop on Del Rio while he had Punk in a side headlock, Del Rio using any weapon he can get his hands on to dominate, steel steps & a table coming into play, and Ricardo Rodriquez's involvement that would turn out to be the ultimate factor in this match.  This was a good triple threat match between all three men that was just like the Orton/Henry match earlier in the night where it was stipulation that helped the match as it was more brutal with some of the shots with the chair & cell looking stiff.  However the bigger issue here was what happened afterwords that was pure chaos that looked like a prison riot that caused the locker room to empty, the police to come out to the ring, and C.O.O. Triple H to take matters into his own hands...literally.

In the end, this was one of those PPV's that again didn't have a bad match on it but also didn't have any matches that you had to just ""take it for what it's worth"" or just average/watchable at best as everyone here put in a strong effort & strong performances so this is one PPV from this year that I would say is worth going out of your way to watch.",1317945600,,6953,4.303215926493109
