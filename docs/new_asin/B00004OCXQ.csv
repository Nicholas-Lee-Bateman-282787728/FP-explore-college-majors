7920620,5,B00004OCXQ,"K Records was indie before anyone tried to be indie. Indie was not a sound, it was not a look, it was just those who recorded music and used small labels to distribute their sound. Most of the time it was self released or locally released. The bands were not trying to start a movement. The bands enjoyed listening to records and hanging out. Their love of music is what inspired them to play in bands and record songs. One cannot be a good writer without having read novel after novel after novel. If the passion is not there, neither is the music. Instead you get manufacturing music. It is processed and predictable. The bands on K were anything but that. They were original and unique. They made music for themselves and didn't give a hoot what anyone outside of their circle thought. The shield around the K.",1366416000,,813,4.5
7920621,3,B00004OCXQ,"I'd heard some negative things about this documentary, but I had to check it out anyway. I grew up in Olympia at the same time K Records and Beat Happening were starting. It's not an overstatement to say that these things and the general ethos of Calvin Johnson changed my life. So anyway, yeah I guess I was predisposed to like this - or hate it. I'm not sure how much someone not already familiar with K would get out of it. There's a lot missing. Some vital bands aren't even mentioned; The Go Team (not THAT Go Team!), Some Velvet Sidewalk, The Pastels, Heavenly, Kicking Giant the whole Riot Grrl movement are pretty much ignored. What you get are mostly Beat Happening, Mecca Normal, Lois and Tiger Trap. There is just a lot more to it than that. More than just bands. Other than a few great videos, directed by Pat Maley and Lois Maffeo, this movie just doesn't ""feel' like Olympia. The interviews are randomly structured and unfocused. You don't get a chronological feel for things or understand how this label works. Just poor editing really. Still, it's worth a looksie. I was just hoping for something more definitive.",1229126400,,1129,4.621890547263682
