631761,4,6303360041,"NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART (1944)

This is a very emotionally draining film. What spectactular performances by Grant, Barrymore, Wyatt and Duprez. Cary Grants restless drifter really makes you feel his frustration with life and society in pre ww2 England. Duprez is lovely as the target of a ruthless crime bosses not so innocent affections. She is a kindred spirit to Cary that sees him for the decent but troubled guy he really is.

Wyatt is charming as the female friend of Grant that hoplessly and not too secretly longs for him. However, the real treat in this movie is the dynamic between Grant as the son and Ethel Barrymore as the mother desperate to get him on the right path, even if it destroys her.

There is a wonderful scene when she buys Grant a new suit and they sit down to dinner together. He knows her secret that she's trying to keep from him and the facial reactions of both of them are highly emotional. His final scene with her is nothing less than gut wrenching. Grant restlessly wanders the streets at night. The cinematography, the rain and the gray color palette helps relay to the viewer Grants feelings of being closed in, clausterphobic and his sense of futility about his life.

Another great pleasure in this film is Cary Grants friendship with the Barry Fitzgerald character, dispensing helpful bits of wisdom. Excellent entertainment and easliy one of Grants best performances, as well as Barrymores.
Obviously, I highly recommend this movie.",1242345600,8,1475,4.818181818181818
631762,4,6303360041,"This is a very nice edition of the film on VHS, and I recommend it highly in the absence of an affordable DVD edition. But with so much video manure out there on DVD, how can the industry overlook this classic film? Grant is at his best in this role of the determined but self-loathing ne'er-do-well. Audiences of the day did not like to see their beloved Cary in such roles, but here he actually gets to show what a fine acting talent he really was. Yes, his looks and style were the envy of every man and the object of every woman, but here, without denying any of that, he unabashedly shows you the dark worthlessness that can often lie beneath a gorgeous exterior.",1204761600,4,668,4.352
631763,5,6303360041,"Clifford Odets wrote and directed this movie.  Naturally, it follows the type of dramatic lines that you would expect from a playwright.  I disagree with Leonard Maltin's review.  This is a very fine movie and well worth any  drama lover's attention.
Cary Grant is very good in his role as Ernie  Mott.  Ethel Barrymore plays his mother in the movie and she is riveting  and marvelous. Barry Fitzgerald is his usual fine self.  The actor who  played Jim Mordinoy--Coulouris I believe--had his character down to a  finely honed edge.  A truly memorable heavy.  June Duprez who played Ada  was superb.  She was lovely, eloquently honest, and terrifically  sexy.
For me it's hard to do much better than a Clifford Odets script.  His dialogue always seems to sparkle with intelligence, wit, and a hard won  wisdom that hasn't had all of its innocence destroyed by a brutal  world.
The theme of the movie seems to revolve around a line that Ernie  says a couple of times.  Something to the effect that:  ""In this world  you're either the fox or the hound.  But what if you don't want to be  either the fox or the hound?  What then?""  Or something along those  lines.  Ernie's task in this movie is express his love for his mother and  Ada and also to find a ""decent life"" in this world.
The  script and the cinemaphotography reflect a gray and bleak picture of the  struggle for survival by working class people in the England of the  30's--shortly before the outbreak of WWII.  It's really a typical  Odets'critique of the brutality and heartlessness of western society.  Regardless of your politics, though, if you like fine drama and brilliant  dialogue, catch this movie.  It won't lift you up, but it should educate  your heart--the lonely one that is. ...",967161600,37,1756,4.710963455149502
631764,5,6303360041,"Cary Grant was born in Bristol, England. His father put his mother in an  insane asylum when young Archie Leach (his name at the time) was only a  boy. Grant grew up without a mother, and when he read the script for the  movie, frinds of his such as Frank Sinatra, and Gregory Peck siad he was  overjoyed, and throughout the film's production, too.  Cary really  got to display some emotions in the film he was never given a chance to in  real life until he was an adult.  Ethyl Barrymore's outstanding, Oscar  winning  performance made it all the more easier for Cary to show his  feelings.  Cary was very excited when he took everyone he knew to the  film's premier, but after, all were stunned at the dark, sombre mood of the  film. The Oscars agreed with Cary, however, and gave him his second and  last nomination... but of course he was stiffed because the Acadamey Awards  are often ridiculous.  A young cockney drifter returns home to help  out his poor mother in time of need.  The film is very sad, and grave,  and sombre. There is nothing else like it in the Grant filmography,  although his dramatic turns are always his best roles.  So dark and  grimy, richly dteailed, beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, cleverly  written, and carefully directed, this is one of the greatest films ever  made, certainly in the Grant top five, and the all around top ten or  fifteen.  Those who know Grant and have any brains at all will be  almost shocked by this wonderful display of how motion pictures can truly  affect us.",965347200,42,1527,4.5724907063197024

631827,4,6303360041,"Based on the novel by Richard Llewellyn, with a script by Clifford Odets (who also directed it), NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART is a socially conscious film, readily recognizable as the work of the author of WAITING FOR LEFTY (a classic social drama of the mid-Thirties),  Ernie Mott (Cary Grant) lives in the back-streets of London, trying to eke out an existence while living with his mother (Ethel Barrymore).  The two of them fight like cat and dog, but once Ernie discovers that his mother is terminally ill, he vows to stay with her no matter what the consequences.  Short of money, Ernie resorts to a life of crime, working for local mobster Jim Mordinoy (George Colouris), and is eventually arraigned by the police after a car-chase (more reminiscent of the streets of Depression-era Chicago than London).  Released on bail by a friendly pawnbroker (Konstantin Shayne), Ernie discovers to his horror that his mother, while pretending to lead a respectable life in her own pawn-shop, has also been involved in a life of crime.  The two of them are reconciled on her death-bed, but Ernie has to face the future on his own.  Although the settings are somewhat stagy, the sincerity of this drama is not in doubt: Odets has a gift for creating memorable sequences, with a clever use of light and shade suggesting Ernie's imprisonment.  Although not actually in jail, he cannot escape his existence: the desperate search for  money to live on will never end.  Nonetheless he resolves to face the future with equanimity - in a time of war, it's important for everyone to forget their individual grievances and pull together.  This is suggested in a memorable exchange at the end with Henry Twite (Barry Fitzgerald), as the two of them look down at the River Thames flowing beneath them, and walk to the river-side down a flight of stairs.  As Ernie, Grant gets the chance to demonstrate his virtuosity as an actor; normally associated with light comedy, he rarely had the chance to grapple with meatier, tragic roles.  The scene where he suddenly discovers the seamier side of life, as he watches the pawnbroker being beaten up by Mordinoy's gang is particularly memorable: Odets repeatedly cuts to reaction-shots of his facial expression gradually changing, and then cuts back to a medium shot as Grant/Ernie fells one of the gang-members who is about to hit a defenseless old man.  While NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART is a propaganda peace, released in the penultimate year of World War II, it nonetheless has a social message that can be understood by everyone about the necessity to eliminate poverty by caring for others around us.",1399766400,,2628,4.865470852017937

When poverty dominate life, the values sometimes a takes a second seat, but Ernie changes his ""drifter"" life style and decides to take care of his dying widowed mother and even accepts to take the responsibility of having wife in his life in war-torn London.

The film is about a widowed woman named Ma Mott who runs a secondhand furniture shop tries her best to teach responsibility to her only son, Ernie, who slowly learns responsibility. He has two girls in his life; the glamorous Ada (June Duprez) and Aggie, a cellist (Jane Wyatt). Both like him, but he admits that he favors Ada, but eventually he losses her to her autocratic ex-husband. Ernie befriends and works for a mobster boss from whom he learns unhealthy ways of life.  Near the end of the film, both Mott and his Ma have been arrested for trading their honest ways and going after a quick dishonest gain of selling stolen merchandize. Mott, bailed out of jail by his Jewish friend Mr. Weber, visits his dying mother in jail for the last time.

Rogers cited the line spoken by Ernie to his mother, ""You're not going to get me to work here and squeeze pennies out of little people who are poorer than I am.""

Cary Grant, for those who love him as the romantic leading man in light comedies, plays one of his few serious roles and is brilliant as Ernie Mott; a man who does not want to run with the ""hounds"" or the ""hares"" but prefers to try to extricate himself from being either a victim or predator.  Ethel Barrymore, as his ailing and cynical mother, is heartwrenching as she faces the reality that she is going to die and that her pawnshop may have to sell stolen goods if she is to have anything left to give her son.  Jane Wyman stars as the girl across the street who loves Ernie, and understands his spriit, but is incapable of leaving her ""safe"" life.  Barry Fitzgerald is compelling as the local rag salesman who understands Ernie, but knows also, unlike Ernie, that the poor and deprived have few choices.
