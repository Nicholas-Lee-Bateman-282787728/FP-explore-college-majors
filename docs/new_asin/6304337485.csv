I like the story....it was a charming little film....one of Henry Fonda's first film and also starred Annabella.  She was a fair actress - not a real beauty, but just cute.  Her claim to fame is that she was the first wife of super star leading man of the time, Tyrone Power. Her best role probably was playing opposite Ty Power in SUEZ.  My reason for reviewing the film is that I would like to find a less expensive copy on VHS.  Just find the price a little steep.",1420934400,,557,4.0181818181818185
7868255,3,6304337485,"The film's right to any fame, apart from its historical significance as reportedly the first full length British (or should that be Irish?) film in colour might also be based upon the brief appearance in it of John McCormack, the great Irish tenor.

McCormack, unfortunately for posterity, was allowed only a few minutes in which to sing a few songs during the course of one scene, and even this too short recital was rudely and infuriatingly interrupted by dialogue from other actors. What an unmerited insult to a very fine artist, and what a tragic lost potential to make something really significant of an otherwise unmemorable film.

It is hardly to be wondered at that McCormack retired soon after this nonsense, probably at least in part from disgust, although, as a sick and prematurely ageing man, he did make a gallant return to concerts and broadcasting, generously expending his energy to raise funds for providing some comforts for the troops during the Second World War. He died at the age of only 61 in 1945.",1168905600,3,1023,4.84
7868256,4,6304337485,"Famous only for the fact that it was the first full-length British film to be photographed in Technicolor, it is also a pleasing if contrived little story which should appeal to fans of Henry Fonda, vintage British films or those who appreciate love stories. Leslie Banks plays Lord Clontarf - a member of the Irish gentry circa 1889 - who is in love with Marie (Annabella) - an exquisite Spanish gypsy. They are married, but Banks dies tragically when he falls to his death from his horse. Marie goes back to Spain where she's accepted back into her gypsy fold...Three generations pass, and in a dual role, Annabella plays a lively girl who disguises herself as a boy in order to ride her Grandmother's horse in the Epsom Downs Derby. Handsome young Henry Fonda sees Annabella at a party where she's dressed in a lovely evening gown and he's smitten... It's just as well the above synopsis doesn't make any real sense, as it's best to view this curio for yourselves. The lush, pastoral colour seen in this film uses soft hues to marvelous effect: the English and Irish countryside scenery is exquisite.  Visually, it's a genuinely beautiful film which is never garish, i.e. overpowering the eyes with brilliant hues like some American films of the period did. Oddly enough, Fonda also starred in America's first all-Technicolor outdoor feature: TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE (1936).",1032912000,8,1380,4.872340425531915
