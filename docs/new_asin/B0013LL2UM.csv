8252047,4,B0013LL2UM,"I don't know anything about Marty Sader, but one thing I do know is that this is a very impressive performance both in the directors chair and as an actor. His transformation from a shy, humdrum, average guy into a mentally unstable and manic drug addict is simply astonishing. We as the audience see this man widdled down to a total waste of human life right before our lives. This man lost a considerable amount of weight betweem the begining of the film and the middle of it, and its pretty amazing to see. His performace begins as a prettty shy but even minded person. But after some rather heartbreaking experiences he becomes a hardcore meth addict, totally unable to think properly, and its absolutely dead-on accurate. I have seen people abuse meth for years and they pretty much end up like this character. Its pretty ugly and sobering to see this transformation take place. This performance is ever bit worth an oscar nomination. His work as director is every bit as astonishing too. The film begins rather straight forward and in the essence of reality. But as our character descends into total mental deterioration the film also follows the idea in a disjointed and chaotic manner. Its beautifully done ever step of the way. This is one of the better films out there about drug addiction. Still not as bleak and ugly as Der kinder vom Bahnoff Zoo, which remains the darkest and most realistic film ever made about drug addiction. In that film the drug of choice is heroin. But I don't think there has been a more chilling tale about the damage that can be done by abusing crystal meth until this movie. I think everyone needs to see this. Its an anti-meth movie with a powerful effect that needs to be taken seriously",1367625600,3,1729,4.635179153094462
