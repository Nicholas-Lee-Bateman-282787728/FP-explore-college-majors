8493754,1,B00668IFYS,"I ordered this twice, the first time it arrived the case looked like an elephant had stepped on it,  It was all in pieces inside the plastic wrapper. I didn't even open it to see if the disk was intact but sent it back.  I had fond memories of the show and really wanted to see it again because of the actors, so I ordered it again.  Mistake! It came in a box with some other videos, they were in fine shape. The Over the Hill Gang case was cracked and when I opened it to take out the disk, the case crumbled into a dozen pieces in my hands. I might have kept the movie even then and found a case for it but, the quality of the movie was so poor that it is not worth the effort.  I will be sending this one back as well.",1507939200,,721,3.8187919463087248

8493758,3,B00668IFYS,"I had been looking for these two movies and found them on a single DVD.  The movie transfer was just ok.  Pictures was not very sharp but still better than VHS I think.  There seemed to be a color shift in the first movie as everything was on the yellow to orange side (warm ).  This could be due to age or the transfer.  The second movie has some real problems in one area where the color went from yellow to blue and then back to yellow for some reason.  Not sure why the color change.  Price wasn't a big deal so will deal with this version until I see a better one somewhere else (if possible).  Movie is full frame and not widescreen.  Seeing as this was made for TV in the years when TVs were formatted in the square format, this is understandable.",1474070400,,754,4.144827586206897
