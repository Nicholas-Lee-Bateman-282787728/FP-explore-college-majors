3648904,5,B001D2651W,"If you like anime but don't want to sweat having to follow a long storyline and have to rewatch previous episodes just to get reaquainted with characters then this show is for you!

Plain and simple. Magical Witch Punie-Chan is one of those no more then 13 episode shows that gives you that quick fix of comedy and fun you'd expect out of such a short series. The main characters are memorable and will have you laugh by either their actions or dialogue shortly into the first episode and steadily throughout to its completion. XD

If this show ends up being a favorite after you've finished the series then i'd also recommend another 'short but sweet' series called Clubbed to Death Angel Dakuro-Chan. It can be rather pervy at times but the humor is too good to pass up and there is never full-on nudity so i'd say it's not for kids but 18 and up would get a blast out of it if you appreciate some adult humor. :D",1356393600,7,915,4.376470588235295
3648905,5,B001D2651W,"The new 2011 re-release of Magical Witch Punie comes with an all new dub that was created for this release. Dubbed by the wonderful and talented group at Headline Studios, this release should satisfy those who were waiting for an English dub to be released when the original discs were pressed back in 2008.
The show is hilarious and definitely worth a look.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1314662400,7,394,4.486111111111111
3648906,4,B001D2651W,"While admittedly not for everyone, to those with a sense of humor twisted enough to appreciate it, punie-chan is pure comedy gold.
While present in only a stripped down, sub-only release due to being a niche title, and with a running time total of around two hours, this release still manages to wring every drop of funny out of the source material with unabashed cruelty and malice.
It's just so wrong, but yet so funny, that it hurts, and it hurts REAL good.",1268870400,3,460,4.554216867469879
3648907,3,B001D2651W,"My mistake I didn't read the information available. If you don't know Japanese and hate reading subtitles this very strange litle story is not for you.
Maybe when I have a better understanding of Japanese language I will watch it again. Otherwise the need to pause to read the dialog just ruins the stories flow. Maybe it will get an English language track someday. Until then I can't recomend it.",1253577600,,397,4.685714285714286
3648908,5,B001D2651W,"It's true that this is another parody comedy and thanks to that distinction, it's very easy to brush this one aside for lacking story or a point for that matter. With hilarious characters and a style that isn't afraid to jump from light to dark and then back again, Punie-chan is a release that I would gladly watch again and show to others as a great example of what parody anime can be. If you're a fan of magical girls, over the top violence and parody comedy than this is a release that belongs in your collection. Very recommended.",1226966400,,536,4.424242424242424
3648909,4,B001D2651W,"magical Witch Punie-chan is a fun anime series. It contains 8 half episodes of 15 minutes each of this magical girl parody. Punie-chan has left magical land to study on earth for year in order to prove herself worthy of being the successor to her mother Queen Esmerelda. However, unlike most magical girl shows Punie-chan is actually evil. She spends the time on earth using her magic to cause chaos and when that fails engage in brutal bone breaking violence with her submissions. Everyone including her mascot is trying to kill her and much carnage ensues. So if you don't mind watching bone breaking violence done by a cute magical girl all in the name of comedy then this is for you. It differs from the directors other magical girl parody Dokura-chan by being more brutal with less blood. Dokura-chan is mischievous and perverted, Punie-chan is evil.

I deduct one star because this is Japanese with english subs with no english language track and the 4 fun Omake episodes which explore Punie-chan's magical Land home are missing. A shame since all 4 episodes add up to less than 10 minutes. Nevertheless there is lots of fun to be had here if you are into this kind of humour",1225929600,4,1181,4.677884615384615

8311059,4,B001D2651W,"I bought this DVD mostly on a whim because it was very cheap.  I don't regret it.
The show is hilarious, reminding me of many nonsense filled mangas.  The high point
for me is the english dub, with the wonderful Veronica Taylor voicing Punie chan.  It's just
hilarious hearing May, and one time Ash in one of the episodes where she gets pissed,
acting like a psycho.  However,  the show is just too short and too many
questions are left unanswered.  Also, the shorts in the special features are not dubbed which
disappointed me.  However, I still recommend buying this set.",1421884800,,573,4.6138613861386135
8311060,2,B001D2651W,"I was expecting more than this delivered. I got through about 2 chapters and couldn't take anymore of this. A bit too kiddy anime. Again, one I should've rented first. Kids and teens might enjoy this.",1410912000,,200,4.583333333333333

8311062,4,B001D2651W,"I was a fan of this series for years on Youtube.  The only reason I bought this version versus the standard version was that for a couple bucks more I got a dub and I was curious to hear how it sounded.  So I figure if the English dub was great then I got a bonus.  If not, I would just stick with the original Japanese Audio and only be out a couple extra bucks.

Turns out the latter was the case for me.  Mind you this series is all dark twisted humor and campy fun, so good voice acting skills probably aren't paramount to enjoying this and it may or may not overall affect your enjoyment of it.  But for me the voices in the original Japanese dialogue just sound so much cuter than what the extra English audio track on this thing offers.

Aside from the fact that I feel like I wasted a couple extra bucks on a dub version when I could've just gotten the sub only version, I gotta say this series is great.  It's by the same creative team that made another twisted comedy series called ""Beating Angel Dokoro-chan"".  While I know many people who love that show, I much prefer this one.  Less emphasis on pervy potty humor & just has more twisted black comedy and extremely dark social satire.  If you are at all familiar with Japanese magical girl (mahou shoujo) shows and all the sugary sweetness prevalent in most of those and wondered what a twisted take on such a genre would look like, this is it.  It's basically the magical girl from Hell, and it's so hilarious if you're open to dark humor & not easily upset/offended.

If you like family friendly Walt Disney type entertainment or Rainbow Bright/My Little Pony type of happy pure stuff that is kid friendly, then more power to you & to each his/her own I guess.  But for those who don't like all that Brony stuff or all that wholesome stuff they show on Nickelodeon but want something twisted yet beautifully animated, you will love this.",1401235200,,1902,4.3664772727272725
8311063,5,B001D2651W,If you like anime and magical girls but don't care for rainbows and sunshine this is your show. This cute little magical girl is pure evil to everyone but her little sisters but her little sisters are not nice to her. This show made me laugh until I was crying tears of joy and laughing hard enough to make my stomach bleed. It is as twisted and evil as I think you'll ever see a magical girl!,1361577600,,393,4.116883116883117
