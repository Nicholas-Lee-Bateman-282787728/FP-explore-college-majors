8726131,1,B00ZSBIX28,"The nature walk was not professionally done. Video was blurry, too much talking, and too much joking around. The relax time video section was better that it was set to music and the video wasn't blurry. Could have been longer. Will not purchase any more video from Kurt Howland Enterprises.",1484006400,,290,4.82
