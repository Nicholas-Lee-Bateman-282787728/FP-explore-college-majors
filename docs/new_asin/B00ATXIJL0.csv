5509904,2,B00ATXIJL0,"Viktor (Luke Goss) is a Romanian hitman. At one point he is called ""stone cold"" in the film. The film starts out with a group of disconnected scenes as it represents various aspects of Viktor's memory prior to his interview. The interview allows Viktor to do some minor narration in telling his life's tale going from a child hitman looking like a greaser, to an adult hitman with a constant 3 days worth of growth on his face.

Viktor grew up in the part of Romanian where everyone speaks English with an accent. He gets involved with the bad guys, goes on the lam to London etc.

The film does have a twist at the end, one that is poorly developed. The characters are written rather badly as is the dialouge. The genius of our hitman is a plot point, but it is not brought out too well, as to make the film interesting. The film consists of a bunch of cardboard cutouts shooting each other. Rather boring for a crime/thriller. Better classified as a crime drama. If you are going to miss a film. This is it.

5509929,5,B00ATXIJL0,"This movie balances brilliance in many ways. It is gritty and gripping without being gory and gratuitous. The storytelling is fantastic, definitely for book lovers and movie lovers. Absolutely no unnecessary bathroom scene. In almost all the films I've seen in these recent years, for some strange reason, filmmakers have chosen to include bathroom scenes where some character is sitting on a toilet. From kids films to every other rating, they've slipped these in, but it doesn't amuse me in the least, nor does it add any value to any movie. So I was glad not to be insulted by one in this movie.
However, this movie, from start to finish, is intent on telling a good story. Pay attention! Be amazed!",1394755200,,702,4.762295081967213

5509941,4,B00ATXIJL0,"If this movie wasn't a limited release, overseas film, people would be talking about an Academy Award for Best Picture! On the surface it doesn't look like much and the film also starts out painfully slow, but Interview With A Hitman is an incredible story, with some really imaginative twists in it. The story begins with an aging Director, looking for one more chance to be on top. He finds that chance when one of Interpol's most wanted, a career killer, contacts him, and agrees to tell his story. The Director has to jump through some hoops, but once they sit down, the mysterious man starts to tell the story of his life. The man knows nothing but killing, have working for a variety of organized crime outfits since he was 10 years old. From there, the film plays out like any other mafia film you've ever seen, there are shady deals, rats, set-ups, everything you could possibly want in a film about organized crime. Interview With A Hitman does take place in Europe though, and can be somewhat confusing. Thick accents and weird names make following the story a bit tricky at times, and that's the only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars. That being said, the ending more than makes up for it, with a twist that you will never see coming. Luke Goss (Red Widow, Death Race) stars as this stone cold killer and does an excellent job, in a role that really wasn't much of a stretch for him. He always plays these cold, calculating people, and it wouldn't surprise me one bit if he has killed before, Goss is one scary dude. This is the kind of film that will have you thinking about it long after it's over, something every writer hopes to accomplish. When you're going over the events in your mind days after you've seen the film and you are still in awe of what happened, you know you just saw something very special. Label this one a must see movie, because the story really has everything you could want and more.",1392768000,,1928,4.495726495726496
5509942,2,B00ATXIJL0,"Poor acting, poor and limited plot with a complete personality reversal for the ""hitman."" Another film in which the write is trying to give a statement or message instead of making it reality.",1391126400,,192,4.848484848484849
5509943,4,B00ATXIJL0,"The bad first.  Well, this movie does drag at times.  The score is pretty boring and sometimes intrusive, in my opinion.  As if some old mental patient is allowed to play the piano while the TV is on.  But that happens only a few times.  Half the cast are great actors; the other half are amateurs.  Lastly, it is hard not to think that the film makers are trying to make this character look like Agent 47.  But the similarities end right away, thankfully, once the story gets going.

The good.  The hitman and his tactics are very realistic, interesting, and fun to watch.  The story is brutal and honest.  Its world of crime is not a nice place.  The people who operate within it--even this hitman himself--are not good people.  You will vacillate from the very beginning between despising the hitman and feeling sorry for him.  That is a beauty of this film, I think.  It humanizes the characters and displays quite a bit of their ugliness as it presents what some might perhaps view as redemptive qualities.

The plot twists a bit and can be confusing if you don't pay attention.  The ending is a superb twist you will not see coming.  A fitting end, though.  Not one contrived to titillate for no reason.  It makes sense.

Overall, this is a pretty good film that entertains.  It is violent and tense at times, disturbing at others.  Give it a watch, if you like hitman tales, mob movies, crime dramas, etc.  This is not an over-the-top Transporter kind of film.  It is a realistic look at a professional doing his job well.  Too well, maybe.",1388793600,,1547,4.5144927536231885
5509944,3,B00ATXIJL0,Overall this movie wasn't bad. As others have noted there definitely does seem to be an issue with the audio. It was difficult to hear a lot of the dialogue.

5509945,5,B00ATXIJL0,"4.6 stars

This was a real surprise for me as I can't recall seeing Goss before, and have never heard of writer/director Bhandal. But together they crafted a very tight and focused thriller in IWAH that belies its low budget and does most everything right.

The script moves well and despite various flashback timeslips it all hangs together nicely. The kid playing the young Viktor is frighteningly believable, as is Goss. This is one of those films where I feel like I saw a different movie from most reviewers; I thought almost everything worked well, from the bit players to the moody cinematography to the exceptional score.

Dan Teicher deserves special mention for that score. It reminded me of some of the best thriller scores, especially Tangerine Dream's Thief, with touches of Hans Zimmer and Jerry Goldsmith thrown in. The first third of the movie is largely free of dialogue and the music creates a perfect tapestry for the plot to play out against. There's some wonderfully weird guitar and synth passages and all in all it's one of the best action scores I've heard since The Dark Knight.

The lighting and locations also work beautifully; Newcastle never looked so good, nor like so many other places. And while all the accents aren't always perfect, they work well enough and I preferred them to tons of subtitles during the Romanian sequences. Above all I enjoyed the compositions and lack of pointless camera movement; Bandhal knew what he wanted from every shot and got it with a minimum of fuss. Economy in almost every aspect is what I enjoyed most about this film, and the way he develops Goss' character so subtly is what makes it all flow so well.

There's no shortage of hits, and they're all done with grim accuracy. But none of the violence feels sensational, and its matter of fact presentation highlights the basic theme: a truly world-class hitman can never afford to really have feelings. Yet Goss quietly imbues his role with plenty of feeling simmering beneath the surface, and that's what keeps this flick ticking.

I loved this film and think it will age very well, and will one day be seen as among the finest of all the assassin films, easily up there with Jackal and other genre classics. Hitman is proof that great action films can be made with a small budget and that you don't need to blow a ton of stuff up to make a good action film.",1377907200,,2377,4.6882494004796165
5509946,4,B00ATXIJL0,"This film is engrossing from the beginning. It moves along with excitement, until a startling end, that some people didn't like, but that I thought had merit. Luke Goss was perfect and sexy. Very decent film.",1377216000,,208,4.805555555555555
5509947,3,B00ATXIJL0,"I expected a little more out of it - it's more like a made for TV movie, had to be really low budget.  The twist at the end was nice, but afterwards I felt I could have just watched the last 10minutes and got the same thing out of it as watching the whole thing and used the other time for something else.

5509948,5,B00ATXIJL0,"Wow!  This movie is great.  Very compelling in the way it is told, getting the viewer very invested in Viktor's story and the reasons for his becoming a hitman, as well as the surprising turn of events that seem to have changed him and his life.

5509962,5,B00ATXIJL0,"I enjoy Hitman movies. However, really good ones are few and far between. This movie, in my opinion, was the very best I have seen since ""The Mechanic "" with Charles Bronson! It is not Hollywood styalized like ""Hitman"", which I enjoyed. Instead you get a brutal real life type hitman. The pace is fast and vicious. You have to pay attention all the time. If you leave the room for an instant, or if someone engages you in brief conversation, by all means put the movie on ""pause"". Or, you will find yourself reversing alot. They speak english, but with eastern Europe type accents, so you have to listen closely. Things happen fast, once the movie gets going. This is the type of hitman movie I've waited for,  for a long time. Luke Goss does a great job, and now he is my #1 male hitman actor , period. My #1 female hitman actress , is Janet Mcteer, from ""Cat Run"". I would love to see both these people in a movie together as a hit-team, husband and wife duo. Not much gore in this movie. No F-bombs I recall. No nudity, just good old quick and brutal killings, and very realistic. What more could you want in a ""hitman"" movie!",1367884800,11,1129,4.3254716981132075

I highly recommend it.

5509966,3,B00ATXIJL0,"The best thing you can say about this film is the performance of Luke Goss as Viktor which brings to mind a young Clint Eastwood.  Goss has a definite presence and probably has a big future in film.  The film itself, however, is a sterile unmoving exercise.  Through no fault of Goss' the film doesn't really scratch the surface about what makes Viktor tick.  Its primary concern is artfully showing people getting killed.  Matters aren't helped by a Tangerine Dream like synth score that drowns out the dialogue and makes you strain to hear what the characters are saying.
