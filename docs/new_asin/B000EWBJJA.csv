2541857,4,B000EWBJJA,"Good story about a hammer-headed kid growing up working one summer in a US National Forest for a forest ranger. Very nice 1920s small town scenery, and awesome western mountain views.",1410652800,6,183,4.935483870967742
2541858,3,B000EWBJJA,"Great scenery, but not much else happened. Jerry O'Conell acting like a stubborn know it all teenager. This movie could have been much more. A story about the early days of the US Forest Svcs. in Montana at the turn of the 19th century. Sam Elliott is solid, as usual, and very convincing. But when you see Sam Elliott wearing a cowboy hat, you're convinced, even without his famouse mustache as he is here. Worth renting and watching.",1409702400,3,435,4.589743589743589

2541923,5,B000EWBJJA,"Every year I read a River Runs Through It and The Ranger, The Cook, and A Hole in the Sky to my high school students. They are both ""beautiful"" novellas. Although The Ranger does not have the production value and narration skills of Robert Redford, it does ellicit the reminiscing and poignancy that Norman Maclean was so good at expressing in his novels.

Enjoy this movie for what it is, coming of age, a sense of longing, and humor.",1462406400,6,435,4.506329113924051

2541940,4,B000EWBJJA,"More like 4.2 stars, there should really be a decimal point value on these reviews, just sayin'. it is 1919 and the U.S. forest service is working in the western wilderness. it is an interesting crew and the story is very interesting too. Sam Elliot is the man in charge, the young apprentice is Jerry O'Connell. The start of the story is rather dull, so you will need to stick with it. The scenery is lovely and the acting is all top notch. I don't want to get too much into the story because there are things...well....one of the main thrusts is the cocky jerry O'Connell character, he is 17 and really needs to grow up and realize the world doesn't serve him. I loved the story and it is well worth the viewing time.",1422576000,13,719,4.333333333333333

2541942,4,B000EWBJJA,I am a fan of Sam Elliott and so I liked this one very much. I like the 19th century westerns gendre better.,1415750400,6,108,3.739130434782609

8114847,3,B000EWBJJA,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1995 and directed by John Kent Harrison, ""The Ranger, the Cook and a Hole in the Sky"" chronicles events in the western Montana wilderness in 1919 where a cocky 17 year-old (Jerry O'Connell) in the forest service is guided by a seasoned ranger (Sam Elliott), conflicts with a card shark cook (Ricky Jay) and becomes infatuated by a cute girl (Molly Parker).

There are only a few Western Staples, like the scenic landscapes, card games, a saloon fight and saloon girls (prostitutes). Other than that, this is a Wilderness Drama wherein a teen comes of age. Its fairly family friendly and only hints at the worldly temptation youths will eventually face. The beauty of the wilderness is emphasized with the corresponding arduous hiking, camping, forest work, relationships and so forth. Its a likable movie if this appeals to you and realistically low-key.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, Canada. WRITERS: Norman Maclean (book) and Robert Wayne (teleplay).

8114850,5,B000EWBJJA,"Great, wholesome movie.  The whole family can enjoy this Norman MacLean story brought to life by Sam Elliot, about a young guy (Mac, the author of the story) when he was learning the ropes working in the forestry industry in Montana in the early 1900s.  Well-written, well-shot, well-acted.  Very wholesome.  Really can't go wrong with this movie",1518652800,2,346,5.017543859649122
8114851,1,B000EWBJJA,"Wish I could have previewed this before buying -  very boring movie with so many useless details supposedly to give a visual of the ""day in the life of""  (boys eating, boys shaving, boys cleaning their food gear...) and Sam Elliott wasted. I gave up after watching about 1/3.",1518393600,,275,4.591836734693878

8114853,5,B000EWBJJA,"Sam Elliott is to me a pure icon and probably to many more of my generation. In this movie, though, I miss his also iconic moustasche but the movie itself is quite wonderful - full of peace and reflections and not like too many movies always running at super speed like the ordinary super hero movie. Here you really get close to all the people in the movie and the situations and its prure simplicity in structure makes it more full of content than many overpriced movies around. No real bad people in the movie but pure human beings with different sides and (dis)abilities. And Sam Elliott who always brings a special form of reflection to his roles.",1516838400,2,652,4.533898305084746
