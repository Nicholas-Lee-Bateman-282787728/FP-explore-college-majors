2942044,4,B000VI6T74,"I got this set early to review for DVDFanatic.com... Here are excerpts of my review:

The episodes in this set are a mysterious collection. To begin with, by the time the third season started in Spring 2004, it was so popular that a one-hour special episode was filmed, in which MXC games were played at Universal Studios in Florida by college students from the University of Central Florida and various other Orlando-area colleges. Titled ""MXC Almost Live,"" it was a competition between the Geeks (with team captain guest star Tony Hawk) and the Greeks (team captain Tara Dakides). The episode was the season premier and is left off this set.

Secondly, there are 27 episodes in season three (including ""MXC Almost Live""), but there are only 13 here - roughly half. And though they are presented in airdate order, the order here skips over a few episodes from September. Not sure why, but I can assume those episode will be present on Volume Four; I hope the same is true for ""MXC Almost Live,"" but something tells me it will be completely ""eliminated.""

Episodes in this set are: ""Republicans vs. Democrats vs. Third Party,"" ""Unemployed vs. Environmentalists,"" ""Snack Food Industry vs. Print Media,"" ""Baby Products Industry vs. Paranormal,"" ""Adventurers & Explorers vs. Dental Industry,"" ""Country Kids vs. City Kids,"" ""Organized Crime vs. Weight Loss Industry,"" ""Novelty/ Gift Industry vs. The Death Industry,"" ""The Amusement Park Industry vs. The World's Oldest Profession,"" ""Oil Industry vs. Make-Over Industry,"" ""Film Industry vs. Phobias,"" ""Romance Industry vs. Firearm Industry"" and ""Footwear Industry vs. Electronic Gaming.""

Thankfully, NO episodes are edited in this set, but the skipping over and season premier omittance is puzzling.

For some reason, the digipak slides out of the slipcase from the left side, instead of the standard right. Odd.

The special features for Volume Three are reduced just like the set. Basically, you get two more original Takeshi's Castle episodes (#s 1 & 67) and the throwaway ""Kenny Blankenship's Top 25 Most Painful Eliminations of Volume Three."" No commentaries, no behind-the-scenes, not much at all.

So you are buying this one mostly just for the random collection of season three episodes. Still worthy of purchase for sure -- but try to score it for as cheap as possible...",1194307200,29,2326,5.137566137566138
2942045,5,B000VI6T74,"Should be titled as Volume 3, not Season 3. Some people like me were wondering if this was the entire third season, 27 episodes, or just half, 13 episodes like all the other releases. This is a 13 episode set and is not the entire third season. The rest of the season i hope is put onto Volume 4.

Besides that, here you get a great amount of MXC, and plenty of funny episodes that are worth watching over and over again with your friends. Definately worth it!!!!

The stunts that the contestants take part in are ridiculously funny, and the constant commentary keeps all of us laughing!  Then, of course, there's the slo-mo of some stunts, playing them backwards, and it goes on and on for an evening filled with laughter!  These two discs were so good, I went back and bought the others that we didn't have!!  I highly recommend these DVDs!!  They're great for a family night of TV!",1381104000,,540,4.404040404040404

2942081,5,B000VI6T74,"what can I say. If you love the silly, the OMG I can't believe I'm watching this and enjoying it, then this IS for you.
I love it. I have all the series that were released. It's a Japanese game show played outdoors where everyone takes part in daft games to see who wins something. What, I do not know, nor care.
You get to see them swim through seas of mud, try running across impossible objects with rubber cannon balls fired at them, ride mini bikes through impossible courses. They are chased here there everywhere, and many wow she's cute moments for those who doubt the integrity of the show.
And none of it is in Japanese. The show was purchased and then voiced over by Americans with a daft sense of humor that you can't resist.
Borderline naughty at times but no more than you hear in the check-out line in your local supermarket.",1355270400,4,839,4.384615384615385

2942096,5,B000VI6T74,"Great stuff.  The voice-overs are gut busting.  Only small problem is that those of the other than Vic and Kenny are muffled at times.  You miss too many of the Captain's comments as people get ready for the rotating surfboard of death and wall bangers and the like.  You can pick up some of these if you used closed captions.  My brother's wife is Japanese and this is on constantly at his house so that is how I discovered it.
