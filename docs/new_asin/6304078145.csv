777857,4,6304078145,Tim Roth as a Bell-hop on his first night is left alone to his own peril. He gets calls from four different films (hence the title) and each 'room' is directed by a different director. This is a very funny film with Tim  Roth cast perfectly as the neurotic Ted. The Misbehavers and Strange Brew  are the funnyest segments. The Wrong man is the worst. But this is a good  film to enjoy.,912124800,,385,4.2465753424657535

777929,4,6304078145,"Four Rooms is a crazy yet watchable film that has the character of a bellhop by the name of Ted (Tim Roth) involved in some risky activities pertaining to his first night on the job. The Four Rooms begins with him attending to the needs of some women who are witches involved in a coven (Madonna as Elspeth,Ione Skye as Eva, Valeria Golino as Atheno,Alicia Witt as Kiva, Sammi Davis as Jezebel,Lilli Taylor as Raven,Amande De Cadenet as Diana. Jennifer Beals, Antonio Banderas, Marisa Tomei, Kathi Griffin, and Quentin Tarantino are some of the other people who feature in different roles within the movie. Events get crazier after Teds duties with the coven. The most hectic was probably the scene involving The Misbehavers (Antonio Banderas as the dad/husband, Tamlyn Tomita as the mother/wife, Lana Mckissack as Sarah,Danny Verduzco as Juancho, Salma Hayek, Patricia Vonne). In the misbehaviors scene the dad threatens and pays Ted good money to look after his kids and one can guess how that goes.",1489968000,,1001,4.964285714285714

778627,2,6304078145,"Caveat Emptor !  This movie wasn't ""released""...it escaped !!  One of the worst films I've ever seen in my long-time-movie-viewing history !!!  It purports to be a fantasy/satire/black comedy/farce (you choose: one, or, all), but in reality it's just a waste of time & money (your time; their money).

Set in an earlier time period in an old-line L.A. hotel on New Year's Eve, four stories are contained in the plot. Linking them together is the new bell boy at the hotel (Tim Roth)...going from room-to-room, story-to-story.  But, even with a running-time of 98 minutes, the episodes about each room are W-A-Y too long, mean-spirited, violent, and, not funny at all.

Episode 1 pulls it off the best.  It's story line & plot, not counting the nudity (which is actually a valid part of the story), works well, and the all-female cast gives it energy, great pacing, and, full-tilt action.  In the cast Madonna, adorable Ione Skye, a beautiful, young Alicia Witt, Valeria Golino, sexy Sammi Davis, Lili Taylor, and, Amanda De Cadenet, give it everything they've got...and it shows.  All of the other episodes pale in comparison.  They should have stopped with just this one ""Room"".

Episodes 2 & 3 use smaller casts, or, just go two-on-one with Tim Roth's ""bell boy"".  Plus, they use violence & profanity like they were going out of style.  Shock value ?  Please !  And, once more, these episodes are drawn out to the point of boredom.  But with the scripts as feeble as they are, even some of the over-acting doesn't work.

Episode 4 is supposed to be the ""best""...but it's probably the worst.  Using an idea from an old ""Golden Age"" TV show (I won't divulge the name of the show. If you're a gluton for punishment and decide to see this turkey, you'll find out then.), the plot line is not only super-violent, but its over-long denouement in ""getting to the point"" has so many stops & starts that you can't wait for it to be over.

The star-studded cast includes many F.O.Q (Friends Of Quentin) as Quentin Tarantino is the one responsible for most of this debacle. Bruce Willis, Marisa Tomei, Marc Lawrence (a true ""Golden Age"" Hollywood supporting-role Legend), Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, David Proval (is a good addition, and is featured in Episode 2), Quentin Tarantino (yes, like Hitchcock, he likes to be in his own movies...only Hitchcock knew when to quit), Kathy Griffin, and, featured in Episode 2 & 4, Jennifer Beals...who has never looked lovelier, sexier, and, more luscious, than she does here.

But, no matter how many stars you pack into one film, if you don't have a solid script, a great plot, and a director (or, ""directors"", in this case) that knows the meaning of control, keeping the action short and to-the-point, and, timing it out by using the word ""brevity""...you won't have a good film. As the old quote I heard once stated: ""If you don't got it all-together to begin with, it ain't gonna be there when you finish !""

I gave it 2 Stars.  Why ?  Well, one star for having the guts to put this out in public at all (it shoulda gone straight to video). And, one star for Episode 1, the first ""Room"". As I said before...those girls really worked hard (never mind the nudity), and that Episode alone was worth watching more than once !",1470873600,,3260,4.690685413005272

779078,3,6304078145,"There are two major caveats to viewing this film: it's wildly inconsistent and it's not for everyone.

The humor in this film is so dark, you could develop film in it. It's liberally laced with arsenic and the combination of four directors give each segment a different tone that never manages to be anything more than mildly entertaining.

Four Rooms employs an abundance of graphic imagery en route to being nothing more than moderately amusing. The best segments are the Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino-helmed bits which comprise the latter half of the film, though even then, there's little here that merits more than a single viewing.

If you're a fan of Rodriguez and/or Tarantino, there may be sufficient reason to sit through this film. If not, then the myriad star cameos -- Bruce Willis, Madonna, Marissa Tomei, Antonio Banderas -- and amusingly manic performance of Tim Roth as the hapless bellhop may be a sufficient draw as long as your expectations don't creep too high.",1469491200,,991,4.957831325301205

Four vignettes are tied together by the story of a hotel bellhop - unfortunately played for maximum camp value, which distracts rather than weaving the stories together. The first story is pointless mumbo-jumbo with godawful actresses and special effects, with nudity used to distract the audience from the lack of anything watchable. The husband/wife and misbehaving kids stories are ok, though heavily crapped on by the bellhop character. The last piece features Bruce Willis, but is dragged down by Tarantino talking way too much; I mean a lot even for him. I suspect the key to the movie is the scene where the bellhop phones a heavily stoned person, i.e. this film is probably hilarious if you're baked.",1416096000,,830,5.110294117647059

780140,2,6304078145,"In the early 90's indie movie explosion four of the young hot directors of the time collaborated to make this comedy-anthology: Four Rooms. The idea sounds great, even if it's simply a vanity piece, but instead it turned out to be one of 1995's worst as well as an embarrassment for all involved (ok maybe not Rodriguez). We get four eclectic stories centered around Ted the bellhop, who grunts and grimaces his way through each predicament. In Tarantino's segment they mention silent actors which gave me a quick glimpse into a better Four Rooms where Roth successfully tackles a silent role. Instead they took the character and made him into something like a withdrawing junkie, where he's sweating and shrieking every two minutes. Tim Roth's character is problem one.

The Missing Ingredient (aka Problem #2): So we start with a small group of witches who get together and talk about inane dumb crap like their ritual. The witches themselves seemed like they belonged more in a porno than this movie, they pretty much pose the entire time trying to look sexy rather than act well, while Tim Roth makes exaggerated facial gestures at the awkward situation when he realizes what the missing ingredient is. After this segment all is forgotten, it's such an inane and stupid plot that I'm already overanalyzing it.

Wrong Man (Problem 3): Things go from pointless to obnoxious quickly as Ted enters his new room, and we're subjected to 25 minutes of 3 characters screaming and yelling nothing at each other. Objectively the worst segment, this is no longer film, it has become an unintentional avant garde endurance test. Finally after it's over and the ringing in my ears starts to die down the film picks up for it's second half.

Lil' Misbehaviors: Robert Rodrieguez's segment is about a rich and powerful man who leaves Ted a good tip if he watches the man's two kids who are left in their room. Something smells in their room so the kids think it's their feet, and it slowly escalates from there into a wild and fun segment. What's this? A segment that actually has traces of good story telling and looked fun to make? Where was this in the first 45 minutes!?

The Man From Hollywood: On to the final sketch, lead by Tarantino as actor & director where he proposes for Ted to be the executioner in a daring bet placed by a bunch of bored talents. This one seems to summarize Four Rooms well, because the final payoff is pretty good but it's still built up by pages of unnecessary and pointless dialogue. Tarantino & co. basically tell Ted about their game in the middle of excessive rambling about nothing.

So while Four Rooms is amateurish inane garbage, it does show something quite interesting, in that you get some perspective of four upcoming indie film directors who, after binging on coke/hookers for months decided this was a good idea to make. Tarantino's segment especially evokes a feeling of empty fame, where these successful people have nothing better to do than cut someone's finger off because they're so bored with their wealth. So that (perhaps unintentional) nihilistic glimpse of Hollywood was more interesting than the actual product.",1394496000,,3160,4.833641404805915

[originally posted 16May2000]

Here's an idea. Get four young, talented directors to do an anthology flick together. It's gotta be a hit! Right?

They've been trying since at least the fifties, and it hasn't worked yet. It doesn't work here, either, though there are pieces of this film that shine with the kind of brilliance that makes these four directors as wonderful as they are, when you take them separately.

First, there is Allison Anders, and the only thing that needs said about her considerable directorial powers is Gas Food Lodging. And while I have a hard time criticizing any film that bares major portions of Ione Skye's body, once again, we have hard evidence that any film project touched by the hand of Madonna turns to [censored for Amazon consumption], no matter how good it is otherwise.

Second is Alexandre Rockwell, whose contribution to this film is by far the strongest. Odd that Rockwell is by far the most unknown of these directors, as well.

Next: Robert Rodriguez, fresh off the smash hit Desperado and about to hit it even bigger with From Dusk Till Dawn. And if you liked the twisted humor in those, you'll like the twisted humor in this.

Tarantino closes the deal with a joke that could have been set up in a fourth--maybe a fifth--of the time it actually took. The gift for realistic dialogue that made Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction such joys is completely absent here, and only beautifully minimally-acted roles by veteran character actor Paul Calderon and ""where is she now?"" actress Jennifer Beals make this segment worth the trouble.

Holding this all together is Ted, the Bellhop at the hotel where all four of these stories take place. Ted is played by Tim Roth, who does what he does best--creeps the viewer out by playing a complete slimeball. In this case, however, Roth's sliminess is kept below the surface, and you're always left wondering why he seems like the engineer of these odd situations, even though in every case the directors go to pains to point out that he is, in fact, the innocent bystander of the bunch. Because of this, the ""segment"" that actually ends up being the best is the frame that holds the whole mess together, as Ted attempts to quit, phones his boss (Kathy Griffin) and ends up explaining the whole night to the stoned and monosyllabic Margaret (an unrecognizable and wonderful Marisa Tomei) before getting his boss on the phone and threatening to quit--the segue between the Rodriguez and Tarantino episodes.

So is it worth renting? Yeah. Not something I'll end up getting a copy of on ebay, but certainly not the worst of the films that made it home this weekend. ** ",1383696000,,2684,4.767241379310345

780293,3,6304078145,"Tim Roth stars as a twitchy, maligned bellhop in this wacky anthology of four loosely-linked short films. With a different director behind the wheel for each chapter, it shouldn't come as much surprise to hear this is an uneven tale that never settles on a firm identity for itself. The underlying theme is light slapstick suspense with a vibrant collection of supporting players, but each act also has its share of dark secrets and sinister overtones. The first two portions are colorful, but too thin for my taste. It seems like both had a solid beginning and ending in mind, and only set about painting by numbers to bring the two together. It's Robert Rodriguez's third act and Quentin Tarantino's closer, though, that drew me to the show anyway. Both serve as bite-sized capsules of both the best and worst traits and habits that have come to define each director. Rodriguez's arc, which naturally features both Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayeck (albeit in short cameos) is a middle ground of sorts between Spy Kids and Planet Terror. It's part kid-focused mayhem and part pulpy, black, gross-out trauma; an enthusiastic, if shallow, ride. Tarantino's adventurous final chapter is more dialog driven, with the director (of course) playing the leading role. Like a caricature of himself, he spends a good ninety percent of the scene spewing pop culture references and jazzy one-liners before the whole drama culminates in a jolting, blunt burst of adrenaline. Overall, Four Rooms is a mixed bag, and apart from the Tarantino chapter, none of the acts stand up particularly well. While fans of the director will no doubt love Quentin's arc, it's short enough that it would probably be just as easily - and effectively - viewed on YouTube or Vimeo.",1337558400,,1750,4.95578231292517

Alexandre Rockwell's is little better but, then, how could it not be? The best is Robert Roriguez's segment.  How could it not be? Antonio Banderas is in it.  Quentin Tarantino seems to be phoning in it.  He essentially uses this as an opportunity to drink and yuk it up with his buddies, namely an unbilled Bruce Willis.

It looks just like it, set and all, and the acting is miserable, save for Tarantino's high note ending and Antonio Banderas, (for what he could do with the pitiful script at hand). This movie is not charming, and how it has four stars overall makes me question humanity.

780420,2,6304078145,"Ted the Bellhop: I'm in a situation I can't begin to explain

Four Rooms is a project where four directors each write and direct a segment, all dealing with Ted the Bellhop (Tim Roth) in a hotel on New Year's Eve. In this case, old acquaintances should be forgot, and the Bellhop is not getting a tip. Though Tim Roth is a good actor, he couldn't save this project, and with four directors, four directions, it was a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. In Tarantino's segment he refers to the movie ""The Bell Boy,"" and Jerry Lewis' performance in which he never uttered a single word. Genius it was, but Tim Roth is no Jerry Lewis, nor is he a Charlie Chaplin, or even a Johnny Depp playing a lost soul with a Buster Keaton fixation such as he did in ""Benny and Joon."" The role was created with Steve Buscemi in mind, but even he couldn't have saved this project.

Since the duties were split four ways, the blame can also be divvied up, but Quentin seems to be the chief instigator, and he had the audacity to not only write, direct, and star in his segment, but he was annoying in all three capacities. Though it went nowhere, the first segment was entertaining for a few brief seconds, just because it featured a bevy of beauties, Madonna, Lili Taylor, Ione Skye, Amanda De Cadenet, etc., as a coven of witches; and Alicia Witt as Madonna's bratty young punque roque girlfriend. I heart Alicia Witt, because she is a smart and sassy red head. Kathy Griffin, another sassy red head, is also wasted in ""Four Rooms."" Flashdancer Jennifer Beals appears in two of the four rooms, but even though my niece said it was the best movie ever, I say it was just an excuse for a bunch of actors and directors to goof off.

Allison Anders  (segment ""The Missing Ingredient"")

780422,3,6304078145,"Four Rooms is an anthology film with segments directed by Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino. What links the four films together is Ted the Bellhop (Tim Roth). His first night happens to be New Year's Eve and the hotel guests make sure that it is one wild celebration that Ted will never forget. The first film entitled ""The Missing Ingredient"" is directed by Anders and stars Madonna, Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, Valeria Golino, and Ione Skye. They are a coven of witches who plan on bringing one of their own back to life. Each witch is responsible for bringing one essential ingredient for the spell  to work. Some of the ingredients include breast milk, and virgin's blood. The Skye character is the only one who doesn't have her specific ingredient. In order to get it she's  going to need a little assistance and that is where Ted comes in. He's the only person who can give her what she needs, so it falls on her to seduce him while the other witches wait outside. The Missing Ingredient in this film for me was Ione Skye's top. I'm not complaining since this short film sets the tone for what's  to come. The second film, and most boring, is directed by Rockwell and entitled ""The Wrong Man"". Jennifer Beals stars as a wife who finds herself tied to a chair and being held at gunpoint by her jealous husband who thinks she's  sleeping with Ted. Beals has some funny lines about Ted's member which cause Ted and her husband Siegfried (David Proval) to turn red with embarrassment. This one didn't play as well as the other ones and kinda slowed the film down. Rodriguez and Tarantino are the closers as Rodriguez directs the third film ""The Misbehavers"". It's kind of like his Spy Kids movies and even has Antonio Banderas. Banderas and his wife are going out to a New Year's Eve party and they hire Ted to look after their two rambunctious kids. He is to have them in bed before midnight. Sleeping is the last thing on the kids' mind since the boy is too busy watching a bikini clad chick (Salma Hayek) dancing on T.V. and the young girl is horrified to discover  used needles and the decaying body of a prostitute under the mattress. Not surprisingly Tarantino's film ""The Man from Hollywood"" is the longest one. It is a remake of an old ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" episode. Tarantino stars along with  Paul Calderon, an uncredited Bruce Willis, and a barefoot Jennifer Beals. If you can't stand watching the Q.T. try to act this one might be painful for you as he casts himself as the hottest young director in Hollywood. He's  just bet one of his drunk friends his Cadillac De Ville if a lighter doesn't light. Let me explain. On the Hitchcock episode a man bets that he can light an old lighter x amount of times in a row before the flame goes out. If he succeeds he gets the car, if he doesn't he has to chop off one of his fingers. Truth be told Tarantino's acting isn't that embarrassing and this segment is a lot of fun. It isn't hard to see why this film is a cult classic since there are enough odd and darkly funny moments that will keep you guessing. It's also a nice reminder of when Miramax and Tarantino were the biggest and most successful names in Independent Cinema.",1222473600,,3231,4.5317324185248715

You know, ""Four Rooms"" really could have been a better film. It was a clever idea, get a group of first-rate directors together for a low-budge anthology film with some of the biggest stars of the '90s. What could go wrong with that?

A lot is wrong with this film. All of the scenes are shoddy and second-rate. The picture and sound quality is lousy, even by 1970's standards. Did they get a cameraman on some type of a prison-study program? And the performances are mostly boring and abysmal. Although, the acting by Antonio Banderas isn't bad. He, especially gave a fine rendition as the harried father trying to have a good time with his wife. ""The Misbehavers"" segment was my favorite.

Aptly titled, ""The Missing Ingredient,"" Madonna's segment was abhorrent. Yes, there is a missing ingredient; it's capability! ""The Missing Ingredient"" was the very worst story mainly because of Madonna. I don't understand, was the director (Allison Anders) afraid to actually tell Queen-Madonna what to do? I don't care if this is a B-movie, that doesn't give Madonna the right to flounce around and act like a no-talent snob.

Madonna walks around in her cute little black witch's costume reading her lines without any feeling or energy. (I get the serious impression that a piece of wet cardboard has more life and energy than this woman.) But what's really annoying with Madonna's ""Elspheth"" is that she simply does not fit in. It's like finding an extra fork from Target and trying to add it to your brand-new place-setting from Fortunoff. It just doesn't look right.

Madonna refused to do any promotion for this film because once she saw the final cut she went nuts. And even though it was in her contract she wouldn't do a single interview in celebration of this movie. And did you notice the movie poster? How many producers allow one of their lead stars to cut and color his or her hair after all of the scenes are shot, but before the final movie poster is photographed, printed and approved? (This is almost as bad is getting pregnant during the production of a big-budget movie. Oh, who did that? Madonna, who else!) In ""Four Rooms"" Madonna had long platinum hair and again after she saw how she looked, she decided to chop off her hair and color it red for the movie's poster. (This was done on a whim. Someone like Madonna probably owns stock in Lady Clairol.) This is simply not done and makes everyone involved look like total unprofessional amateurs.

It's been said for the latter part of the last 30 years that Madonna is a master-manipulator who knows how to court the press and the public, if only for her own self-serving agenda. Personally, I know the woman is a genius. Who else could have done everything she did and held on to her throne for 25 years, if only out of sheer psychoneurosis? In the '80s Madonna went out of her way to prove that she was a singer. In the '90s she wanted to prove she was an actress. And, in the '00s Madonna has done everything under the sun (just short of getting a lobotomy) to make us all believe that she's a kind and loving individual. The New Madonna wants desperately to be accepted as a ""real person."" But as we learned years ago, with movies like this, Madonna can't act if her life depended on it. She comes off as devious and rather obsessive. Like Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, Madonna is a very lonely woman who is incapable of showing or receiving any type of sincere affection. Perhaps, the biggest role of her life was just playing the part of Madonna?

I suppose we should be thankful that Madonna no longer makes movies. She stopped making movies 6 years ago, after that distorted nonsense that her hubby directed,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swept-Away/dp/B00007L4OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swept Away</a>. (FYI, his career tanked after that!)

780486,3,6304078145,"An anthology of short films bound by one character is what you'll find in FOUR ROOMS. And all of the shorts are directed by four different directors with decidedly four different styles that overlap one another via Ted the Bellhop (Tim Roth,(...) .

It is Ted's first day on the job and it just so happens to be one of the busiest days of the year for the hotel (New Year's Eve). Relieving the old bellhop who'd worked there for fifty years, Ted is given sage advice that eventually falls apart on him (mostly related to sex, accountability, and keeping one's own council.)

The first episode is entitled ""The Missing Ingredient."" A clutch of witches inhabits a hotel room and they try to stir up incantations to revive a lost sexual sisters. Sammi Davis, Amanda De Cadenet, Valeria Golino, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, and sex-pot Madonna round out the cast here. All of the witches brings a required item to the resurrection ceremony ...except one. She forgot to bring the sperm of a young man to add to their concoction. Enter Ted the Bellhop who finds his manliness much in need. This was the weakest of the four stories, failing to develop the tale or any of its characters, thus making the entire thing fall flat on its cinematic butt (even though there were plenty of nice butts and boobs in it). (...) director Allison Anders misses his mark.

The next episode is ""The Wrong Man."" Sigfried (David Proval) and his wife Angela (Jennifer Beals) are having an interesting New Year's Eve playing a rather kinky game of tie-up-the-wife- and-see-what-happens. Ted is brought into their midst and the sparks start to fizzle. Is Sigfried gay? Is Angela psychotic? Funny thanks to David Proval's history as a film bad-guy, this one had potential thanks to director Alexandre Rockwell.

The third installment is ""The Misbehavers."" A husband and wife played by Antonio Banderas (...) and Tamlyn Tomita plan to spend a romantic evening out but have to take their two misbehaving kids with them. Or do they? Enter Ted the Bellhop again. They hire him to watch over the boy and girl while they're away. Porno channels, a dirty syringe, flames, and a dead hooker all await the husband and wife upon their return. More of a slapschtick homage to (...), this over-the-top episode was directed by (...) director Robert Rodriguez -- who loves to direct Antonio Banderas (they worked together on (...) and (...) Probably one of the more laugh-out-loud endings of the four.

The final short is ""The Man From Hollywood"" directed by and starring Quentin Tarantino (...). At the end of his shift as well as his wits, Ted is summoned to the penthouse suite where he gets involved with a wager between two very drunk Hollywood types. Norman (Paul Calderon) and Chester Rush (Tarantino) have a bet going that Norman can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row without it failing. If Norman succeeds, he'll get Chester's cherry and expensive car. If he doesn't, Norm will lose a finger. But none of his friends in the room want to be responsible for doing hacking it off should Norman lose the bet. Enter Ted again. Offered a large stack of (...) bills if he'll do it, Ted numbly picks up a meat clever and...

But we won't give away the ending.

Seeming more like a pet project than anything of note, this 1995 offering is entertaining but sorely bland. The Jerry Lewis antics of Tim Roth are admirable (Lewis also starred in a film entitled (...) but the homage to comedy of days gone by felt forced or missing.

Each of the ""Four Rooms"" contains a different story, with different characters, Roth being the only connection between the four. Some smaller plot elements tie the four rooms together as well. These are slight and might be missed, but help to make the movie more whole.

My favorite ""room"" is the Tarintino room. Once you see Quentin you know things are going to get really funny, really dark, kind of weird but always worth the price of admisssion. His is the last of the four rooms though.

Antonio Banderas' room is also great. Although hes not a major part of this room, because the story focuses on his two kids in the scene, his reaction to the mischief the kids get into is awesome! Very fuuny.

Madonna has a nice little role as the head of a witch coven. In their room they are trying to raise a goddess, and need some ""special"" help from Roth.

Depending on how you like your comedies this movie may or may not be very funny to you. I liked it becuase I thought it was a bit smarter than  slap stick comedies...Roths caricature of the proper British bellboy is the absolute best part of the movie as a whole.

Call it a collaboration of different comedic talents. So, let's go through them, one by one.

Story one: The Secret ingriediant

Not really much to go on here. A coven of witches are trying to ressurect some virgin wicth who was wrongly accused of a crime. Not really that funny. It's a bumpy start but it gets better. ted stays the same goofy self all through the movie.

Story Two: the wrong man.

A mistaken identity sex game in which ted accidently found himself in. Constantly he tries to escape the room. Funnier than the last one. Still bumpy, though.

Story Three: The Misbehavers (Directed by Robert Rodriguez)

Funny story of a couple leaving their kids in the room to go celabrating the new years eve at a party. These kids are bad news. They get their hands into any and everything. Poor ted runs rampant to make sure they won't misbehave or else the father will kill him. ted at his best here. hilarity incarnate. Explosively funny.

Story four: The Bet (Directed by Quentin Tarantino.)

An after hours new years eve party with a witty group of filmakers who have had too much to drink. Quentin stars. Bruce willis too. Ted stays the same, quirky and naive as well. Funny and different, but quick on the jokes. There is one take where there is just one uncut shot, lasting well over ten minutes. They must've rehearsed that one for hours.

780570,4,6304078145,"""Four Rooms"" is far more entertaining than you would expect from its generally negative reviews. Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed ""Love American Style"" on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. It was made between the time Tarantino made ""Pulp Fiction"" and worked on ""Dusk Till Dawn"" with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four stories:

""The Missing Ingredient"" - Madona has simply never looked better and her ""come get me"" dress will burn your eyeballs. Alicia Witt plays her stock alienated teen and delivers sarcasm as only she can.

""The Wrong Man"" - Alexander Rockwell directed this segment shortly after directing ""In the Soup"" so he already knew how to get the most out of Jennifer Beals. Her diatribe about Ted's sex organ is a cinema classic.

""The Misbehavers"" - Rodriquez directs his favorite actor Antonio Banderas in something that is a throwback to classic Laurel and Hardy. Not only do his two kids misbehave when left alone in their hotel room, but their misbehavior is so comprehensive that the closing shot reveals a room of total anarchy. It is wonderful slapstick on a huge scale, with comic timing worthy of the Laural and Hardy and the Marx Brothers.

""The Man From Hollywood"" - This has the best script with Tarantino reserving the best stuff for his own character. He even reprises the ""tasty beverage"" line from ""Pulp Fiction. Beals has already found her way to this room by the time bellboy Roth arrives and she delivers more good lines. I was impressed that Tarantino built up his suspense ""before"" the contest began and then did not try to extend the suspense but ended things on the first attempt.

The best bit in the whole film might be Roth's phone call to his boss. Marisa Tomei answers the phone in a room full of comatose post-New Years Eve partygoers. She then does a version of her ""My Cousin Vinnie"" expert witness routine, this time concerning types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious (but totally stoned) inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen, holding the controller but not using it, as the other player maniacally manipulates the other controller throughout the entire phone conversation.

Genre Grade: C+

Final Grade: B-

Tim Roth gives a hilarious performance in this collection of four short films by four different directors. Allison Anders directed the first segment of the film. She is pretty much an unknown and according to this part of the film, she isn't much of a director. Alexandre Rockwell (In the Soup) directed the second segment, and it was hilarious and quirky and entertaining, which lifted my spirits for this seemingly stupid film. Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Desperado) did an excellent job in the third segment of the film, giving the best direction in the whole film. Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) wrapped up the movie with his segment, but it didn't compare to the dark humor that Rodriguez gave the film. Tarantino did stick to his roots though, writing great dialogue and having a little fun with shock value too. His mistake is that he wrote himself into the script and gave the worst acting out of anyone else in the film.

In the end this was a funny and interesting compilation of stories that ultimately makes Tim Roth look like a hysterical madman. Check it out if you enjoy any of the directors of the film or if you like Tim Roth.",1116979200,3,1205,4.669811320754717

Everything takes place either in the hotel rooms, corridor, elivator or hotel office. It's brilliantly done, with the 3rd and 4th rooms being the funniest and best put together. However the first two rooms are enjoyable also.

It had never really been tried before, however the four directors including Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodrequez, managed to pull it off! It's just a shame that this movie often goes completly unrecognised. It's totally under-rated. Buy it now.

780615,4,6304078145,"The movie starts with a bellhop starting his shift. He is the night bellhop in what seems to be a high class hotel. He is the only one working that night and has to contend with four different roooms (not all at the same time) which is where the name comes from. Each room has its own segment and is written by a different writer. The first two I don't remember who did them, but the last two are done by Robert Rodriguez(#3) and Quentin Tarintino(#4).

Now that all of the rooms are fun to watch. The first room is horrible and contains one of the worst actresses in the world, Maddona. Stay away from this room and don't bother watching it. Basically it features a group of witches attempting to resurrect their leader. They all bring different items but one of them doesn't. She needed to bring sperm but didn't, so guess who is going to give them some? That's right the bellhop. She doesn't want to take advantage of him but is forced to. There is some nudity in this scene(and it is a beautiful women who is nude) but that would be the only reason to watch this scene, and I say just fast forward until you get to it.

The second room contains a couple who are in the middle of a major conflict. The bellhop walks into the room to find the husband with a gun and the wife tied up. The husband is accusing the bellhop of committing adultery with his wife. He denies it and they go back and force. The bellhop gains his trust then loses it, and back and force like that. It was quite funny but not my favorite.

The third room contains Antonio Banderas(I don't think I spelled his name right) and an actress playing his wife. They want to go out but they have two childen, a young son and older daughter. These two children are trouble and you can tell from the moment they appear on the screen. Now in order to get away from their children they pay the bellhop to check on them every hour. The parents leave, mischief occurs, children don't listen, and more mischief happens. Loved this scene, one of Robert Rodriguez's greatest works. The only thing of his I liked more was From Dusk til' Dawn.

Then there is an intermission where the bellhop complains to the pothead manager of the hotel, who is played hilariously by Kathy Griffin. Good break up from the rooms that perfectly sets up the final and greatest room of the movie.

The final room was written and stars Quetin Tarintino. Quentin plays a famous actor who rented the penthouse with a bunch of his friends. They are drunk and bored and asked the bellhop for what seems to be a bunch of random items. When he delivers these he is instantly greeted by a drunk and merry Quentin. He invites him to drink a little with him and another of his friends, while Bruce Willis argues with his wife on the phone in the bedroom. Eventually he asks to the bellhop to help out in an outrageous bet with crazy circumstances(don't want to give it away) and the bellhop eventually after much begging to do it.

That is the basic plot. It is a good comedy and for a little more than 10 bucks it is a great addition to anyone's DVD collection. Get it, skip the first room, and enjoy.",1108944000,6,3129,4.34017094017094

Overall the acting is good, with many small roles by actors/actresses such as Madonna, Jennifer Beals, Lili Taylor, Ione Skye, Bruce Willis, Marisa Tomei, Kathy Griffin, and Antonio Banderas.  The best part is directed by Robert Rodriguez, and has Banderas as the father of two kids who are involved in comic adventures (this also foreshadows Rodriguez's development of the Spy Kids films).  There are no extras on the DVD and the first sequence with the wiccans is a bit creepy in retrospect since they are involved in Diana goddess worship in a film made before Princess Di was killed.

780697,5,6304078145,"""Four Rooms"" is four short films, written & directed by four very different directors. They are Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez,

and Quentin Tarantino. It also features an all star cast that includes Tim Roth,

Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Paul Calderon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, and Quentin Tarantino. This movie is weird, but since four people with four very different styles of film-making wrote and directed it, that's pretty much what you have to expect. The first short is written & directed by Allison Anders

and it's called:

The Missing Ingredient: At his first night on the job (and all alone, no less) Ted, the Bellboy stumbles upon a coven of witches who plan to resurrect a fellow witch. The only thing they need is semen...From Ted. This short is pretty stupid, but has some funny moments in it.

The next is by director Alexandre Rockwell and it is:

The Wrong Man: When asked to bring ice to a room, Ted stumbles into the wrong room where a man is holding his wife at gunpoint. The story here is pretty much bare boned, but has some great dialouge and Tim Roth is excellent in this short.

The next is director Robert Rodriguez's:

The Misbehavers: Going out with his wife, a man (Banderas) asks Ted to watch his zany children to make sure they don't misbehave. Ted sees it as a chance to make an easy 500 bucks and goes for it, not realizing just how wild the children are. Banderas is hilarious in the role and everything that happens is hilarious.

And finally we have Quentin Tarantino:

The Man from Hollywood: Before quitting Ted wanders up to the penthouse which is inhabited by actor Chester Rush (Tarantino) and a group of his friend's including Norman (Calderon), the woman from ""The Wrong Man"",

and Leo (Bruce Willis, who's uncredited). Chester and Norman have a bet;

If Norman can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row, he gets Chester's beautiful car. If he can't do it, Chester cuts Norman's pinky off. That's where Ted comes in...Tarantino is great, Bruce Willis scores a couple laughs, and of course...It's written by Tarantino, so it's great.

The two best films here are ""The Man from Hollywood"" & ""The Misbehavers"", while the other two are just OK. The cast is really good, except I'm not sure why Tim Roth plays the character as if he's got ADHD and is on cocaine. The movie's got a whole array of actors and producer Laurence Bender plays the same character he did in ""Pulp Fiction"" credited as Long Haired Yuppie Scum. This moive isn't perfect, but it is funny and strange. So, Thumbs up.

Second film: Tim Roth gets the wrong room and the story contains sick sexual fantasies, a large gun, and a psychotic pill popping maniac, need i say more?  Third film: (by far my favorite) Robert Rodriguez directed this hilarious short where Tim Roth has to take care of these kids....its HILARIOUS i can't say much about it or it will ruin it for you.  And Fianly the Fourth Room: Directed by Quentin Tarantino this final room is a let down.  Tarantino himself acted in it which is my biggest complaint.  He over-acts and ruins it.

I found that witch plot very over the top but it was so funny. I also found it a little confusing in the second room with the wife and mad husband. But the other 2 rooms were great!

780702,5,6304078145,"What the heck is this?
That was my first question when my erstwhile sidekick and chum brought this movie into our home as a rental. I had never heard of this flick. Neither had my wife. In fact, he had rented it on the strength of a recommendation of a friend. So, with no expectations or preconceptions to color our views, we set about to watch this thing.
One great advantage to having no particular expectation of an unknown film is that our ignorance led to bliss. Before the end of the film, we were literally roaring with laughter. Not mere chortles, mind you, nor the odd guffaw that may accompany an isolated humorous incident, but laughing at scene after scene as the movie progressed.
This is an episodic comedy that has Tim Roth as a bellman at a Hollywood hotel working alone on New Years Eve. He becomes  involved in 4 different sketches. Each one just a wee-bit more madcap than the last. From being seduced by a Coven of Witches in the first sketch, to a bizarre couple who play dangerous games in the second, to misbehaving children in the 3rd, to an unexpected and hilarious ending in the 4th, one simply never knows what is coming next. Nothing is predictable, and along the way, our hero (or antihero) encounters a splendidly malevolent Antonio Banderas, quirky Quentin Tarantino, and a surprising appearance by Bruce Willis.
There is much to be said for this film, but I would not wish to spoil things by giving too much away. I believe the best way to see this film is as we did. Just get it, watch it, and let it impress itself upon you in all its bizarre glory.
Very few films made today are as funny, or as quirky, or offbeat, or simply hilarioius as this film. My wife has a sister in the hotel/hospitality business, and we plan to present this one to her as a gift.

I loved this film. I have a great appreciation for anything that can be original in this age. Originality is getting harder and harder to achieve. The first room (story) is pretty cheesy, but it gets better with each room thereafter. The 2nd room is humourous. 3rd room even funnier. The 4th and final room is an insanely hilarious finale. Based on the first room, I was going to give this film 4 stars, but I couldn't bring myself to giving it less than 5. If you are into big budget box office (generic) movies, then this probably isn't the film for you. But if you have an appreciation for original thought and artistic brilliance, then you have to check this out.

Sure it's a little silly in places but that's the charm of this obvious secret film crew party movie(theres an oxymoron if i've ever seen it). But this is what Four Rooms is! Think about it - a movie set on new years eve, every scene involved drinking alcohol and ALL of the actors would have worked for scale if they were paid at all(money I'm sure went on buying MORE alcohol to fuel the back-stage party). I'm not being sarcastic at all when I say that because I get this movie. It is not the follow up to Pulp Fiction or El Mariachi or In the Soup, ect. It IS funny for what it is - Four friends doing something they love and not trying to live up to their small past success. Tim Roth in a part originaly intended for Steve Buscemi(turning it down only because he felt he had already done the bell boy part in the Coen Bro's Barton Fink), really has fun in this role. His range is evident in all of the rooms from bliss to screaming bloody murder, and no matter what anyone says I think he ties the movie together quite neatly.

To admit that I was both saddened and chagrined. Wondering to myself: ""Are favorable aesthetic judgements really so easily bought and persuaded?"" And perhaps more melodramatically:  ""Is this what American cinema has finally  been reduced to?""
  Quentin's final filmic vignette, a blatant cannabalization of an Alfred Hitchcock story, basically consists of long and tiresome diatribes by the director/actor. The camera lovingly massages him with a series of static head shots, in the talking head style of a television journalist, while he egomaniacally mugs and indulges himself in the most excruciating and high-schoolian sort of verbal masturbation. (The gentleman obviously has the ego the size of a Macy's Thanksgiving parade balloon.) If it is intended as satire, then it is merely a watery satire of a satire--something that completely loses reflexivity in utter artlessness. Poor acting. Pretentious and viscid dialogue. If you want to see wierdness that is informed by good directing then check out the strange and wonderful films of Baz Luhrman or Pedro Almodovar. Or hey, just watch ""South Park"" on television- at least that's relatively funny by comparison.

But every once in a while, a star or director hits it big enough that (s)he earns the opportunity to humiliate him/herself before an international audience in a celluloid disaster.  Or maybe some maverick executive decides that it's time to unleash Tinseltown's enfants terrible in a big-budget assault on the senses.  Shortly thereafter, those in charge realize that they made a huge mistake, and decide that maybe high-concept entertainment really only works in Europe and Asia.  While 'Four Rooms' might appeal to young Wiccans for Allison Anders' embarrassingly silly girl-power vignette (featuring-- surprise!-- a poor performance from the calculating Madonna), or make Quentin Tarantino purists happy for his cringe-inducing knock-off of an Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode, it's nothing short of a cinematic trainwreck that will be remembered primarily for ensuring that a number of talented moviemakers and actors would go through a well-deserved dry spell before working again.
Robert (El Mariachi) Rodriguez' vignette is the most noteworthy of the lot, which is like saying that being eaten by sharks is a hoot when compared to being eaten by zombies.  The premise of the film, with Tim Roth's hapless bellboy caught in the middle of French farce-style hijinx on acid, could have worked. But this hopeless vanity piece does nothing more than showcase the major-league pretensions of bush-league players.  The stories are inept, the pacing is leaden, the dialogue is preposterous, and the comedy is so desperately ""hip"" that the end product is embarrassing to watch.  Sadly, it all culminates in Tarantino's  shameful paean to himself at the height of his post- 'Pulp Fiction' glory.

The first segment of the movie is by far my least favorite, but I still enjoyed it to a point.  Overall, I believe the acting sells the movie.  Tim Roth, the main character, is absolutely brilliant.  Without his acting, his character would have merely told the story.  Instead, he makes the story.  Also, Antonio Banderas is great.  He seems to work well with Director Robert Rodriguez, and the two of them have really perfected his character.

I'm giving it 5/5 stars because I didn't NOT like anything about the movie.  You got F-ed by an oven full of witches??  If you enjoy comedies ... I think you should take a chance on this movie.

780822,5,6304078145,"If you are a hardcore Tarrantino fan, you'll probably like this. If you are a reserved, serious person, you probably won't. Pretty simple huh? Maybe not...
I'll break it down room by room. The first room is sort of just to give us the happy ""Ted scored"" feeling. Sometimes I'd really rather fast forward through this, as the script is sort of silly in this room. But overall, I've seen a lot worse, and remember, we're not taking this film seriously right?
The second room is the mistaken identity room that really shows off Tim Roth's ability to act. I have read other reviews that say he is horrible in this. I disagree completely. You can see every emotion the character feels pass across his face, which makes it very humorous. Jennifer Beals does a good job in this section, but like a lot of dialogue in Tarrantino films, you get the strict, rigid scripted feeling. In other words, the actors spit out this long line of gibberish that noone would really say in real life. People have to take the time to come up with these types of speeches.
The third room is probably the best, if not a little bit disturbing. I think everyone did a good job in this section, especially Tim Roth when he was aggravated by the children.
The fourth room seems to be plagued by bad acting. In my opinion, only Willis and Roth do a good job. Tarrantino is frightfully bad in his dialogue, and that scripted feeling comes back stronger than ever. Meanwhile, you'd be hard pressed to believe that anyone besides Willis is drunk. I think it was a bad case of overacting on the part of the others. Overall, its still worth watching, and the movie is great if for no other reason than Tim Roth (who is terrific in everything he is in -- See The Muskateer, as his acting is the only thing making the movie worthwhile).",1006819200,4,1798,4.468085106382978
780823,4,6304078145,"This film is a fast-paced romp written and directed by 4 different indie directors. They each have a story to tell that ties into the main story involving Tim Roth as a bell-hop ordered to run a small hotel by himself on New Years Eve. Suffice it to say that Roth gets WAY more than he bargained for, but don't worry, he'll get the last laugh! If you liked ""Dusk Till Dawn"" ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"", and actually LAUGHED at times during those films, then you are truly sick enough to enjoy your stay in each and every one of these ""Four Rooms""...",1000425600,5,556,4.355769230769231
780824,1,6304078145,"Trees Lounge was the worst. That film had no redeeming value whatsoever. At the very least, I can say that the last ten seconds of Four Rooms (prior to the end credits) are amusing and memorable. On the whole, though, this is a wretched, loathsome attempt at entertainment and should be avoided if at all possible.
Four Rooms is a series of four short films chronicling one very unenviable night in the life of Ted the Bellhop (played by Tim Roth in one of the worst performances of his career). While each of these short films has a similar background, the director of each mini-feature is different, with Allison Anders (Gas Food Lodging), Alexandre Rockwell (In the Soup), Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Spy Kids), and Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) collectively directing the movie.
Originally I saw this in theaters the night after it was released, and I walked out in the middle of the third segment. Later I saw the rest of the film and was not impressed. More noteworthy, though, is how sickened I was by what I originally saw of this film. Lesbian witches exchanging inane and unamusing tripe dialogue, Tim Roth's face covered with someone else's vomit, young children jabbing hypodermic needles into each other, and Quentin Tarantino... and frankly, I'm not amused.
I have met people who found this movie humorous. To each his or her own, and so you may wish to consider renting this if you absolutely must have more independent films in your life. But I cannot recommend this horrid film to anyone under any circumstances.",1000166400,8,1533,4.854961832061068

However, by the end of the movie I was intrigued enough to watch it one more time. That led to another viewing, and another. Suddenly, I was hooked. Sure, it's not the greatest movie ever made, and there are people who will absolutely hate it. There's really not much to say to those people; the plot is absurd and the characters aren't much better.

Don't go into it with any expectations whatsoever -- as with life, that's bound to leave you disapointed.

It is very fun, I think. Obviously, some people don't like it, but if you don't mind silly comedies that are made only to be fun, with no deeper meaning, I think you will laugh a lot while you watch this movie. I laughed almost every minute. Tim Roth is overacting in a funny way and makes it without getting too annoying. The cast is impressing, but don't expect to see very much of the stars. Most of them have very small parts and quite few lines.
If you don't expect this movie to be serious at all, I think you will be very entertained. But if you know you don't like that kind of movies, I guess you should avoid it. But if you don't mind watching a silly movie now and then, give it a try!",984528000,3,870,4.093567251461988

The ultimate Room is the Penthouse, the last of these Four little films. In 'The Man From Hollywood' by Quentin Tarantino, thrill is combined with absolutely brilliant humour. And again, Tim Roth, though small his part and few his lines in this Room, is the STAR aming stars.

The other two vignettes are awful, especially the first one.  I agree with the person who said it's just an excuse to have a few beautiful actresses show their naked breasts.  Tim Roth makes a bad imitation of PeeWee Herman throughout the movie, but his antics are more moderate in the last two stories.",979171200,6,565,4.436893203883495

780861,3,6304078145,"This is a strange movie to talk about... Some people love it, some people hate it, and if you watch it, you'll understand why.
When you take each story individually, it can get cumbersome and un-entertaining.  But if you focus on Ted the Bellboy (Tim Roth), it becomes quite hilarious.  His reactions to the situations he's put it crack me up every time.  Not to mention, in the third room Antonio Banderas once again makes me say, I want to be Antonio Banderas.
At any rate, this is a movie that you should see at least once, because this movie defies easy recomendation.  If you just take the word of people who don't like it, you could miss out on a great movie.
As for the DVD itself, it is completely lacking in features and the sound is just a little off, but after the first viewing you hardly notice.
It loses a half star because the movie is definately one you have to be in a certain mood for, and one and a half stars because the DVD presentation is sub-par, but still overall a good movie and worth buying the DVD if you really like it.",973555200,32,1048,4.277777777777778

Its all a bit of a hit and miss affair. Ambitious and seemingly desperate to plumb new depths, it often fails with many scenees falling flat. This is all the more surprising when it has such an impressive and talented cast which includes Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Quentin Tarentino, David Proval and Amanda De Cadanet. The whole thing holds a few laughs along the way but on the whole its only very moderatley enjoyable. See it only if curiosity gets the better of you.",970790400,3,629,4.7272727272727275

However the movie turned out to be very disappointing.  It is about a bellhop (Roth)  who encounters some very interesting guests as he goes to 4 different  rooms.  I ended up turning off the movie in the third room because I  couldn't stomach any more.
After watching the first hour and cringing  at each of the different rooms, I realized this was not for me.  There are  some very twisted thoughts in this movie.  The first room involves a bunch  of witches including Madonna and for some reason a couple (not Madonna  though) take their tops off.  The second room made even less sense, with a  drunk man a gun and his tied up wife.  As the bellhop went to each room I  got more and more disturbed and ended up turning it off and returning it  for something else.
This movie is probably great for someone into cult  films, but I thought I was getting a comedy with a great cast and turned  out to be very disappointed.",963705600,3,1055,4.290816326530612

Four stories, by four different directors, all threaded together by the bellhop. Obvious praise  is spread on to Jerry Lewis of the similar film he made, by non other than  QT who acts in the final story/room.
ITs comedy, there's no doubt about  that. The worst story is bar far the first, the witches are merely an  opportunity for Madonna and her pals to take their tops off. Thankfully, it  gets better from that moment on, and there is a definate feeling for the  bellhop by the time the whole fiasco ends.
Hats off the the idea, and all  credit to the actors, who really managed to pull off what would otherwise  have been a so-so idea turned movie.

I'm too darn lazy to look up the other contributors so screw it, on with the review. This movie is all about  Ted, the bellboy (played by Tim Roth, of at least two other Tarantino  films), who is stuck at a sprawling Hollywood hotel on New Year's Eve. Ted  is faced with four equally nerve-wracking sets of guests, which nearly  drive him over the edge. At least he gets something in return for his hard  work in the end (in the Tarantino directed segment). The soundtrack is done  entirely by the incredibly talented but underrated band Combustible Edison  (insert fanfare here), who are one of my favorite bands, of not my current  favorite.
