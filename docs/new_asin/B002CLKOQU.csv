8364212,3,B002CLKOQU,It was just the trailers but you get to see the best parts anyway,1430524800,,65,3.7142857142857144
8364213,3,B002CLKOQU,"This is one of the better collections of sci-fi trailers, most of them from the golden age of the 1950's and early 1960's, a few toward the end date as late as 1978. Almost all 50 are complete theatrical trailers, a very few are TV spots. Video quality varies but for the most part is quite acceptable. I would rate this at least four stars, maybe five, except for the fact that you have that annoying Passport ""bug"" (logo) along with the DVD title running continuously in the lower right hand corner all the way through the program. It's pretty faint here but I still hate those things with a passion, one of the worst things cable TV ever brought us. In my opinion when you pay good money for a DVD you should NEVER have to look at those crazy things which really take away from the theatrical experience you are trying to create in your own home. Still recommended for the program content if you like old movie trailers and/or the classic and not so classic science fiction films. A similar companion volume entitled ""Destination Outer Space"" is also available from Passport and is recommended with the same reservation about the continuous ""bug"".",1261180800,10,1150,4.614634146341463
8364214,5,B002CLKOQU,"I will not ever diss.anyone,for what they think. May not agree. I thought we should rate the show,and the quality,and not get bogged down in how they do business. This show is very good quality,and the content is just plain fun. If you love sci-fi old and new,cheesy and serious,get ready for the cheesy,a 101 min.ride through B-flick history. I wish there was one of these for all of the old sci-fi and horror movies ever. It showed me some I had not seen,so I got them. I LOVE IT.",1256428800,4,482,4.366666666666666
8364215,3,B002CLKOQU,"The program itself is excellent and I found myself watching the entire trailer collection in one sitting. Quality better than expected also. However, Passport (a company I have never liked) has not the company name but the DVD title ""Destination Earth: Alien Invaders"" superimposed in the lower right hand corner during the entire program. For many this is a deal breaker and lowered my rating by one star. The extra content is lame but the trailers are entertaining..probably more than the movies themselves were.",1253404800,14,514,5.130952380952381
