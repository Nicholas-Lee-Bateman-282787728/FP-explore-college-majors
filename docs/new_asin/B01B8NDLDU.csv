8749673,1,B01B8NDLDU,"I was a big fan of The League and didn't miss an episode. In fact, I watched most of them multiple times. I was surprised when I learned it was about to end, and really wanted to savor the final season. Unfortunately, season 7 was a huge disappointment to me from start to finish. The writing was horrible, and unfunny. It seems like the writers just mailed it in. Buy a different season if you're a fan.",1507248000,,404,4.259740259740259

8749677,5,B01B8NDLDU,"It is a show that should appeal to those who enjoy improv comedy, low-brow humor and fantasy football. I enjoyed most of the episodes. Esp liked the episodes that featured Nick Kroll (Ruxin) and Mark Duplass (Pete) the best. plenty of eye candy with appearances by Deanna Russo and Brooklyn Decker (more of her in Season 6) as well. I was impressed with how many talented improv actors they were able to bring in such as Ike Barinholtz, Rob Huebel, Keegan-Michael Key, Leslie Bibb, June Diane Raphael, Matt Walsh and Thomas Lennon. This show made even Adam Brody, Rob Riggle, Zach Woods and sarah Silverman somewhat palatable. I own every season except Season 5.",1484092800,,662,4.815789473684211
