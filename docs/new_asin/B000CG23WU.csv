2464625,4,B000CG23WU,"Really like this video for the music, the visuals are good, but nothing great.  My daughter (17 months) seems to like it.  She likes sesame street better though.  But as an intro to jazz, it gives her the exposure to this genre of music - pretty much just as I hoped.",1219708800,,267,4.196078431372549
2464626,2,B000CG23WU,"Music is good, but everithing else is boring. My kid did not want to wach it for a minute, comparing to other videos that could watch  for hours.",1201564800,,145,4.178571428571429
2464627,5,B000CG23WU,"I have a very active baby!  She does not care for Baby Einstein DVDs, but LOVES Jazz Baby Jazz.  Her eyes are glued. It is the greatest thing for helping me get dinner ready!  Thank you!!",1184025600,2,187,4.138888888888889
2464628,5,B000CG23WU,This is my triplets' favorite video!  The pace is of the graphics is good for babies and toddlers and the music is enjoyable even for adults.,1160352000,3,141,4.423076923076923
2464629,5,B000CG23WU,"Unlike some videos which seem to have a frenetic MTV pace to them, 'Jazz Baby Jazz' offers a gentler pace, which I believe is more appropriate for young children.  The video presents colorful animated graphics (animals, cars, bouncing balls, etc.) interspersed with live action footage of babies and toddlers playing with toys.

We've played this video in the background when our 10-month old is playing with his toys.  He tends to look up at the TV periodically, and if he catches one of the clips of another child, it holds his attention for 10-20 seconds.  Generally, though, he isn't too interested in the animated graphics.  He'll look for a few seconds and then return to what he's doing.  Some might think the video isn't so good if it can't hold his attention.  But I argue the opposite.  Any video that turns a kid into a glassy-eyed zombie who can't look away from the images should be destroyed.  So I really appreciate the fact that this video offers something of a slower pace, that allows my child to watch for a little while, but then lets him get back to his business. (Of course, we rarely ever have the TV on--generally it's just for movies after the kid goes to bed--so perhaps he hasn't had time to be zombified.)

It's also nice that the images are accompanied by a hip jazzy soundtrack.  I want my boy to be musical.  Oh, sure--the Baby Mozart and Baby Bach and Baby Mike Oldfield and all the other classical selections are probably great for kids, but come on--let's have some variety!  Jazz, baby.",1139356800,9,1521,4.630597014925373

2464658,5,B000CG23WU,"My son loves this video.  We got it for him around 14/15 months. He's now almost 20 months and still loves it.  He watches pretty intently and dances to some of the music.  There is little (if any) dialogue other than the names of the colors, lots of fun sounds and images of common objects/animals that littles can identify.  My son especially loves to point out the fish during the underwater scene.",1428192000,,401,4.527777777777778

2464684,5,B000CG23WU,Our baby absolutely loves this. I wish there were more videos like this. It is simple enough to keep her attention for long periods of time. It doesn't have sing-along style music or characters with annoying voices. I can deal with the same jazz tune playing in the background while she plays.,1410048000,,293,4.653846153846154
2464685,5,B000CG23WU,"We have twin 2 year old girls, and when we need to get the girls to calm down for nap or bed we put Jazz baby jazz on.

2464686,3,B000CG23WU,"music is great. there is no spoken audio (e.g. ""red""). association of some colours to video shown is sometimes too weak.",1407283200,,120,4.761904761904762

2464689,5,B000CG23WU,It's definitely a strange video and at first I thought there was no way my almost 2 yr old daughter would watch it. But the music is fantastic and she loves the colors and images. She always asks for the monkey video.,1401840000,,217,4.190476190476191
2464690,5,B000CG23WU,"First, I'm not a huge fan of jazz.  However, since they were 8 months old, my twins love this video--from the music, the images, and the sounds.  My son used to hurriedly toddle his way to the television as soon as he heard the introductory music.  Even to this day, he will cry out with excitement when he sees it.  The coloring and the sounds of movement seem to rivet my twins, who are almost 22 months old now.

A few commentaries compared this video to the Baby Einstein series.  I found this video because none of the Baby Einstein videos captured my twins attention.  The music just wasn't intriguing enough for the twins.  As for criticizing the images as being poor quality--I disagree.  It was simple and basic---which quite frankly is what little ones need as they can only focus on a few images at a time.

I highly recommend this video.  While there is jazz music playing on occasion, there are enough sounds and simple images to intrigue little ones.",1398470400,4,964,4.546511627906977
2464711,1,B000CG23WU,It really wasn't what I expected.  I thought this video would be a bit more upbeat jazz with more color animation.  It was too boring for my taste and my baby was not interested at all.,1397347200,,185,4.111111111111111
2464712,5,B000CG23WU,My eight month old grandson was amused by this video.  Nice music.  Simple scenes. Video kept him amused for several minutes at a time.,1395792000,,135,4.583333333333333
2464713,3,B000CG23WU,"I'm not much into turning on the tv for my 7 month old, but do like to have background music on while he plays with his toys.  I was hoping this would be more stimulating and of better quality.  It didn't capture my child's attention for even a second!  I wouldn't consider it a total bust, considering I purchased for the sole purpose of background music...so it does serve it's purpose.  If you are thinking to use this for a child that actually wants to watch something...I do not recommend it.",1395100800,,497,4.428571428571429

2464716,1,B000CG23WU,"This is not worth the purchase, even at $2.99.  The puppeteering is poorly done, the music isn't that great, and my little one, who LOVES to watch TV, like Baby First (which is available for FREE on Prime!), was absolutely disinterested and disengaged.  I wish I could get my money back.",1393459200,,287,4.607843137254902

2464720,5,B000CG23WU,My kids love this show and ask to see it all the time (ages 2 1/2 and 1). They love all the different sounds and the puppets and all the different actions that are going on. They get so excited about the silliest little things (jumping around and cheering for the monkey pulling the cart full of letters). Looking at other reviews it really seems like this movie is a hit or miss just depending on your kids. lol!! For me it was totally worth the couple bucks I spent to buy it!,1381276800,,478,4.150537634408602
2464751,2,B000CG23WU,My 1 year old was not interested in this at all.  He seemed very bored watching it.  It might be meant for younger ones.,1379635200,,120,3.9583333333333335
2464752,1,B000CG23WU,This video is awful. My son is kind of scared of the characters. It does not hold his attention at all.,1378857600,,103,3.9523809523809526

2464754,2,B000CG23WU,"It seems like a cheap knock off of Baby Einstein. This doesn't seem to interest my baby at all. He is enthralled by Baby Einstein ""Baby Mozart""

2464755,1,B000CG23WU,Very disappointed... wish I hadn't spent the 2.95..next time I will hope for a better video.. graphics suck and not really for babies as advertised,1372809600,,147,4.92
2464756,4,B000CG23WU,"We are watching it right now! My 15-month-old son loves all the pictures and I like the music- better than some kids music that makes you wanna pull your hair out after hearing it over and over! The only thing lacking is the graphics, not that my son would notice, but overall happy with it.",1366848000,,291,4.3090909090909095
2464757,5,B000CG23WU,"Music, puppets, and photography/art all wonderful. The colors captivating his little 10 month old senses. We used it on a road trip to reward him for having to sleep away from home for a couple nites. Just enough at times when his patience wore from being in the car too long. He loved it. Movie just 39 minutes---not too much stimulation. :)",1366156800,2,342,4.532258064516129

2464759,5,B000CG23WU,"I wasn't too impressed at first, however my opinion doesn't matter.  My baby loves this video!  Thus, I do too.  He sometimes squeals with delight when he sees the other children in the video.  The music is catchy and upbeat.  This has been a very handy a few times when he was really fussy and I needed help to calm him down.  We watched part of it together and it distracted him nicely.",1362700800,,388,4.2465753424657535

2464773,1,B000CG23WU,It's called JAZZ and the music is dull and the puppets barely move. My 9 month old twins will watch just about anything. But not this. :(,1357171200,,137,4.111111111111111
