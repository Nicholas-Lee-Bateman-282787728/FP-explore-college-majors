8099627,5,B000CNGC0M,I have always liked the movies made from the books by Danielle Steel.  Each of the movies in Volume 1 are a must-see.  The story lines are great and the woman in the movies are terrific!  I highly recommend this volume!!,1361404800,,220,4.317073170731708
8099628,5,B000CNGC0M,"Love all 3 of these movies.  Family Album was often shown on Mother's Day in the 90's. Couldn't wait to watch it each year.  Then one year it was never shown again.  That's when I went looking for it on DVD.  Glad to have found it and be able to watch it whenever I want.  Great shows from great novels.  Happy Danielle let them make them into Lifetime Television Movies.  Thank you, Ms. Steel!",1358380800,,394,4.243243243243243
