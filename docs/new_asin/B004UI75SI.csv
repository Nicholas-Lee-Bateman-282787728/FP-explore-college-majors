8441555,5,B004UI75SI,"I live in Fort Bend County and like to get movies made in the area, just something sort of interesting to me.  I somehow stumbled on this title in some list, somewhere. I can honestly say that at the end, I sat quietly stupified for quite a while. Very hard to fully describe, in this short space.  I guess The Caine Mutiny meets Singing in the Rain; If you like movies like Double Imdemnity or Hello Dolly, you would like this. Very good use of neighborhood sidewalks and parks. Suitable for the whole family (except don't let Grandma sit with you if she's incontinent). The whole film is a good teachable moment for parents and youngsters. Almost gut-wrenching in the way it plunges into the depths of the souls of the main characters, but you felt good about it afterward. Good lighting, wardrobe and hair Sound recording maybe A- I had to back it up once or twice for a ""what did he say"" moment.  I'm the first reviewer here? really, with all your friends and family? I see a review where this is on Instant Video, you'd think Amazon would have the reviews show up both places, oh that's right, the DVD has extras, I guess they're nifty.",1361923200,,1141,4.44976076555024
