8340631,2,B001T6OP8W,"This is not your typical Jess Franco film.  Completed at the end of 1979 and before he did a variation on his film 'EXORCISME'-1974 with extra scenes and titled 'THE SADIST OF NOTRE DAME' aka 'LE SADIQUE DE NOTRE DAME', this Euro sex comedy 'THE GIRLS OF THE COPACABANA' aka 'LAS CHICAS DE COPACABANA' is a bit tedious and nothing to recommend.  Three students (two guys and a girl) in a variation on Director Francois Truffaut's classic 'JULES AND JIM'-1962 decide to fly to Rio from Paris to continue their threesome adventures in a series of disappointing vignettes including a cameo from Franco muse Lina Romay here playing Lia, the Brazilian nymph of all things.  If you like travelogues with grainy footage, mediocre sex scenes (strange considering Franco is the master of the erotic), and unfunny dated comedy, this is for you.  The music score by alumnus Daniel White is the best thing about it.  Televista releases it in a watchable full screen transfer which is perfect for the product. For Franco completists only.",1344988800,3,1025,4.867816091954023
