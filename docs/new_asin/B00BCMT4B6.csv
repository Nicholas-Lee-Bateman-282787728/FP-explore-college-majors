5578233,4,B00BCMT4B6,I love Fraggle Rock! It is so amazing to have all of the episodes together. The only problem is it is not formatted for a wide screen. That means your have the black strips on either side of the show...no big deal except my husband says it will burn out the pixels and ruin the tv if you watch too much tv like that?

The box itself said it was included inside, I opened the box and there was no graphic novel and there was obviously extra space in the box set where the graphic novel was supposed to be. The plush keychain and all DVDs were inside just not the graphic novel. Great collection, I just want everything I paid for...",1431302400,5,449,4.357142857142857

5578326,4,B00BCMT4B6,I came into the series a little late I mean really late. I saw the fraggles when they made an appearance on the Muppet Christmas special and I never got to watch them as a kid. When the series appeared on Hulu I marathoned through the whole thing. I've been a fan ever since. When I saw this box set I didn't hesitate to buy it. Great extras and archival footage included. The reason I gave it four stars is because they cut off Gerry Parks' interview. The feature ends abruptly. So sad. :(,1402358400,16,490,4.223404255319149
