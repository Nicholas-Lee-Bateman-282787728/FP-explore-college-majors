4915811,5,B0060MSRQ6,"This is a wonderful DVD! Megan has been teaching for years and years, and it shows.  She explains things really well, and goes at a good pace.  She goes through a lot of the main poses, and just does a great job.  It is also nice to have a wide variety of people with different body shapes in the DVD, and also a lot of alternate ways to do poses if you aren't ready for a full pose.  Great DVD, totally recommend!",1358726400,3,414,4.012195121951219
4915812,5,B0060MSRQ6,"I seldom review exercise DVDs, mainly because I seldom love them.  This Megayoga DVD is a wonderful exception!  Especially great if you're a beginner (no matter what your size or shape).  Lots of modifications for poses that could be difficult (taxing my old and creaky knees, for example), and modifications to make the poses more challenging.  Good one!",1338163200,19,355,5.068965517241379
4915813,5,B0060MSRQ6,"Being a very plus sized woman, yoga has always been one of those things that seems great in concept but I was always physically unable to execute.  There was always too much of my body to get into the various positions.  Even the gentle or beginners DVD routines were too difficult and I often would get too frustrated to continue.

MegaYoga has allowed me to finally participate!  I love that I can see all the modifications as the DVD progresses, and am encouraged that with enough practice I can get the poses perfect and even advance to the more intense versions.  Megan allows enough time for those very new to yoga to get into position and still participate in holding the pose, while those that know what they're doing are able to focus on perfecting and breathing.

Love it!

4915814,2,B0060MSRQ6,Very dissatisfied with this product. It is very new age with it's meditations. Thought we were getting a video to exercise with not be manipulated. Will never use it again.,1334793600,4,172,4.766666666666667
4915815,3,B0060MSRQ6,"I like the idea of tailoring yoga to plus size women, but in practical terms this doesn't really work.  I was a size 20 when I started practicing yoga 5 years ago.  I don't think it would have been helpful then, and isn't now.  To me, the poses seemed overly simplified, to the point where you wouldn't get the benefits.  Many of the proposed adjustments also seemed extreme, and some of the uses of straps would be painful in practice, a lot of digging into skin.  If you're completely new to yoga and any sort of exercise and very big (much bigger than the author, I'd say at least a size 22), you will find this helpful.  If you're smaller than that and have any sort of exercise experience, a regular gentle yoga book or DVD, or a class, will have enough adjustments to accommodate and inspire you to find interpretations of the poses appropriate for your body.  Yes, I do think larger people and full figured women need some special approaches to enjoy yoga's potential, but this isn't it.  Sorry, because I love the concept and I wanted to love this.",1332288000,28,1056,4.463541666666667
4915816,5,B0060MSRQ6,I love this DVD! It manages to teach even the most unlikely of candidates how to do yoga and be sucessfull at it. Excellent for the full figured woman and wasn't boring.,1330905600,14,169,4.3125
4915817,5,B0060MSRQ6,"This video is perfect for someone new at yoga. It has variations for someone with physcial limitations. She uses ""real"" people in the video who are inspiring and helpful to watch.",1327190400,38,179,4.806451612903226
4915868,5,B0060MSRQ6,"Excellent yoga for anyone who has some trouble with movement due to weight, disability,  or disease like arthritis.  Love Megan, the instructor, feels like your right there in class with her!",1462665600,3,191,5.129032258064516
4915869,5,B0060MSRQ6,Amazing modifications for every level,1461024000,,37,6.6
4915870,5,B0060MSRQ6,Wonderful.  It's so great that she shows different versions of the same poses so that everyone can do yoga.  I love that all the woman on the video are different shape & sizes.  It's a nice long program great for Saturday or Sundays.,1456790400,2,233,4.372093023255814
4915871,4,B0060MSRQ6,"After receiving this DVD, I realized two things: 1. Megan Garcia is an awesome Yoga instructor, and 2. I hate Yoga. I think this DVD would be perfect for a plus size woman who actually LIKES Yoga, and her techniques would really help them. But Lord love a duck, I was bored out of my mind. If Megan ever comes out with, say, a power lifting video, I'll be all over that. But this DVD is getting donated to some other Yoga-loving gal, because this fattie is not into it!",1456531200,10,469,4.222222222222222
4915872,5,B0060MSRQ6,Like it.,1455580800,,8,3.5
4915873,5,B0060MSRQ6,I really enjoyed this workout. I was sore the next day! My 5 year old enjoyed doing it with me. There are 4 different people to watch depending on your abilities. I would recommend a yoga block if you are able to get one. Great for beginners of all sizes!,1441756800,6,255,4.12
4915874,4,B0060MSRQ6,"Had not done yoga in over 25 yrs, read reviews on this... it was all i expected and some... it does end abruptly so if you are not paying attention you are left meditating... which is not such a bad thing... I loved it!",1433376000,4,219,4.0
4915875,4,B0060MSRQ6,"There are so many things I love about this DVD. For a plus size woman first starting yoga this is amazing with great modifications to work with your level of comfort. Additionally, being a beginner, it's rather nice to watch a yoga session that DOESN'T use ""models"".  Only thing I didn't like was the breathing and meditation parts of the session. I thought those were lacking. May be better served to do centering and meditating on your own and use the DVD to do the pose sections. Would've liked to see more poses as well. But overall, good starter DVD.",1427760000,6,555,4.55
4915876,3,B0060MSRQ6,I found this dvd to be really great if you want adaptations. I found it to be too long though. Also moves a bit fast. Nice for the adaptations though.,1425686400,3,150,4.033333333333333

4915929,4,B0060MSRQ6,As described.  Modifications are a bonus.  A signal (bell) to the end of the practice/cool down/closing meditation would be welcome.,1416182400,2,132,5.55
4915930,5,B0060MSRQ6,This is a great video.  Nice to be able to watch a yoga video and not feel overwhelmed.  Liked that she had people of different sizes doing the exercise at different levels.,1410739200,,173,4.375
4915931,5,B0060MSRQ6,"This is a great way for we larger women to get started with yoga. Megan is personable, able to give non shaming direction. She has helped me to stay in the present moment and feel good about the body I have now. I have purchased this for others.",1409875200,2,245,4.125
4915932,1,B0060MSRQ6,"This yoga session was too slow for me. I liked some of the variations for plus size women, but I was so bored. I felt like taking a nap halfway through the DVD. After I did finish the DVD I wasn't sweaty like when I do yoga or watch other yoga DVDs. I didn't feel very stretched out or anything either. I didn't really get a workout.",1407283200,7,333,3.985074626865672
4915933,4,B0060MSRQ6,OK,1406505600,,2,2.0
4915934,5,B0060MSRQ6,Love the modifications this video provides for us plus sized girls!!,1404345600,2,68,5.2727272727272725
4915935,2,B0060MSRQ6,I hoped to see different poses made easier. This may be a good cd for a total beginner who has never experience yoga.,1398902400,3,117,4.130434782608695
4915936,2,B0060MSRQ6,"The video has some good information, but the DVD is poor quality. It would not play in several of my devices.",1397520000,2,109,4.238095238095238
4915937,1,B0060MSRQ6,"As a woman who has put on a few pounds over the years, I thought this DVD would help me with my poses as I returned to yoga after being away from it for over 2 years due to a car accident. I have also practiced yoga, on and off, for over 15 years. The instruction is so poor in this DVD that sometimes I didn't even realize that we had moved on to the next pose due to lack of directions. I should not have to look at the TV constantly to see when poses change as doing so does not help in posing and transitioning, but actually hinders one's practice. Music was bad, studio was uninspired, and Megan's voice was not soothing in the least to me. The modifications for curvy women consisted of taking your fat rolls and moving them aside and binding your breasts with a strap. None of this was helpful and I will be giving this DVD to Goodwill or throwing it away. It was a waste of time and money.",1396137600,9,897,4.073446327683616
4915968,5,B0060MSRQ6,"I have carpal (wrist) and cubital (elbow) tunnel issues so I can't put a lot of weight on either body part. I found that using the chair modifications in this video were most comfortable for me and yet I was still able to feel the full stretch and width of each movement. Megan speaks in a very pleasant, mild voice that is soothing and easy to follow. I greatly appreciate the various levels of modifications available and greatly enjoy using this CD.",1394409600,4,452,4.524390243902439
4915969,5,B0060MSRQ6,This is a great yoga video for large women. I have her book. The video helps me move my body parts so I can more easily attain the positions.,1394064000,3,141,3.896551724137931
4915970,4,B0060MSRQ6,"Megan gives lots of possibilities for varying physical abilities to actually do yoga. It's a good entry in for people who due to physical limitations or fitness level can't start with the regular yoga classes. I appreciate that one lady is practicing yoga from a chair one, one is going easy on the knees, and one offers a few more challenging techniques.",1391385600,9,355,4.741935483870968
4915971,4,B0060MSRQ6,Think I might end up liking yoga after all. Love the different shapes of the women. I feel like I fit right in. Nothing too jarring or poses that seem impossible. I could feel my muscles working and was very relaxed by the time i was done. I have purchased many  exercise DVD's in the past and have never found one I really liked....until now.,1390089600,4,343,4.276923076923077
4915972,5,B0060MSRQ6,"I was skeptical that they would really have women that are fullfigured on this video, however they really do, they reflect women of all shapes and sizes and show how to do the yoga moves using a chair if needed.  It moves a a good speed so that even as a beginner I was able to stay up with the moves.",1389916800,2,301,3.9344262295081966
4915973,4,B0060MSRQ6,"Pros: This DVD is really nice for those who are just starting out on Yoga, plus size, those with physical challenges & for those who just are not so flexible. You can use a chair, towel or yoga bans to help (which are shown by different girls on the video). There are sections that you can go to learn the techniques. They show breathing, breast binding (for those with a large chest), how to move the flesh (for those with bigger belly) etc... It's great for different body types-not what you normally find in a normal yoga video.

Cons: you need a yoga block if you do not want to use a chair for one move sequence. The voice doubled for like 3 sentences (echo) on the dvd for mine. The meditation section at the end just ends without any warning-goes to main menu. Founds that a bit odd since I was meditating-at least a bell or something would of been nice.  If you have bad knees you'll need the chair because they keep going to downward facing dog, lunges and squats so make sure you have a chair that will be comfortable to put your weight/hands on during video or at least a towel folded up on the mat.  It is 1 routine only.

Overall it's a great way to start out on Yoga and start to build your balance. I still like Tai Chi way better.",1388448000,27,1246,4.222689075630252
4915974,5,B0060MSRQ6," is to exercise regularly.  I've never been an active person and my 56 year old body shows it!  I am trying to motivate myself to go to the gym and to take yoga and other classes there but for now this workout is working out for me.  The ""moving the flesh"" adaptations seem obvious once they have been demonstrated but I've never been helped in that way before.  Holding the poses really stretches the muscles and the inversions get the heart pumping so you really do get a workout.  The deep relaxation and meditation at the end are the icing on the cake (so to speak).",1388102400,7,570,4.330188679245283
4915975,5,B0060MSRQ6,"Being a curvy woman, myself, I found this instruction video very helpful in learning yoga from a curvy standpoint.  There are modified poses that are demonstrated with sensitivity and grace.  We are all made in different shapes and sizes so to have a video available for those shapes and sizes that are different from what society has labeled ""norm"" is wonderful.  Thank you!",1387584000,3,375,4.920634920634921

4915977,5,B0060MSRQ6,Again I am so glad I was talked into purchasing this video. I have been going to get the book but it is hard to find and after really thinking about it decided it would probably be better to watch the moves being done than just reading and looking at pictures. This video shows the correct forms and makes it easy to adjust if you need to.,1380844800,3,339,4.074626865671642
4915998,4,B0060MSRQ6,"I'm a very new beginner to yoga, so I needed a DVD that would teach me what I'm doing and would accommodate my plus size, and so far this has been a great choice.
Megan is a personable instructor, she's easy to watch and likable. She has different students working out with her showing various ways of modifying the poses, like for people with bad knees or problems getting up/down from the floor.
I think the routine goes a little fast sometimes, but that is probably due to my lack of knowledge of yoga in general, but I think someone who is more familiar with the poses wouldn't have an issue.",1375747200,2,596,4.378378378378378
4915999,5,B0060MSRQ6,"This is a good yoga workout for those who don't fit the usual mold for yoga DVDs.  She gives modifications for people with different strengths and bodies.  If you've had trouble with yoga DVDs before, give this one a shot.  It's the first one I've really enjoyed and wanted to do everyday.  I got it after I got ""Just My Size"" (which was nice, but too easy...good for relaxing before bed, though).  I do this one before I go to work every day and I can feel the change in my muscles after just a short time.",1373241600,8,507,4.185567010309279

4916002,5,B0060MSRQ6,"Being a plus size Diva, I needed to stay fit and agile. I like the gym but I had taken a yoga class and loved it. I wanted to still practice at home with a few friends.

Me and my friends enjoy it immensely.",1367020800,4,335,4.1692307692307695
4916003,5,B0060MSRQ6,"I purchased this video and I wasn't really expecting what I received. I had a good workout, and I really felt the effects days after. I stretched, turned, twisted and moved parts of my body I hadn't moved in a while. It felt really great. I've done yoga before, only in studios mainly. I was a little uncomfortable because I'm always the largest person there. The instructors didn't modify the moves, so that was an addition to my insecurity in the class.

Hard to see the poses. Sometimes only works one side. The audio of the dvd itself is kind of off with double talking and heavy breathing at times (the breathing was kind of freaky). I felt it could have been done alot better by showing each of the girls demonstrate each pose. Seeing all of them at the same time, made it difficult. I feel her first dvd is a better work-out and I am more likely to continue using it.",1359331200,40,577,4.026086956521739

Shows modification's and if your bigger you'll feel bether seeing that you are doing the poses right even though the weight is in the way. She shows ways around everything.
