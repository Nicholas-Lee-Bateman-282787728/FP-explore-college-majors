3474654,5,B001AYXFSY,"An astonishing indictment of corporate control over our media.  The so-called ""conservatives"" who have taken away our free speech (and civil liberties) are complete hypocrites, as revealed over and over again.  Why are they so afraid of sex?  I think it's a control issue, definitely not normal.  After all, without sex, no continuation of the species.  That's why the sex drive is so very compelling; just look at the entire animal kingdom.  By being outrageous, Larry Flynt keeps hammering away at the abuse of our First Amendment rights.  His products may be over the top, but he definitely makes his point.  I want this documentary available in colleges and repeated often on cable TV.",1218153600,11,689,4.982456140350878
8280364,5,B001AYXFSY,"Larry Flynt deserves much more credit than he's given for being one who has stood up for First Amendment Rights - and for paying the ultimate price for it. From exposing the hypocrisy of politicians and preachers to pointing out the preposterous rhetoric of evangelical censorship, Larry Flynt has pulled no punches and this documentary delivers his story with heart and soul. Highly recommended for anyone who doubts our civil liberties are endangered - Flynt urges everyone to use the power of their vote to make a difference in our ever-eroding democracy.

8280367,5,B001AYXFSY,"When will this come out in cd ? The First Amendment is very important and should be treated with great respect. We live in a country [so far] that has this magnificant right, the right to free speech.  People have stood up for it and they should. My mother was an English teacher. She came home one day and asked: How do I teach Merchant of Venis without Shylock ?  I don't want to live in a sanitized country. This film is excellent.  I just want to see it in cd.",1406851200,,464,4.076923076923077
8280368,4,B001AYXFSY,"Reasonably priced, arrived on time and in one piece. I think you have to sort through the book and decide what you think is true. Personally, I believe pretty much what the book said. Let's face it, when the gov goes after someone, they go full force. And THEY hated him and they probably despise the 1st Amendment. Sure, Larry was in a business that most people consider sleazy but that's not the point.  The point is the ""1st Amendment"".",1353715200,,439,4.4875
8280369,5,B001AYXFSY,"I really enjoyed this movie and love documentaries in general.  For reference I had seen the motion picture ""The People v. Larry Flynt,"" and that was just about all I knew about Larry Flynt.  I'm not into porn either, and I don't think I've ever watched one start to finish.  The main focus of this film is our ""wonderful"" U.S. government's war on Larry Flynt.  The harassment of Larry Flynt might have been done under the guise of protecting the general public, but this war was one that was indeed quite personal.  Part of Larry Flynt's magazine, Hustler's, regular features were satirical political cartoons w/ a seriously obscene twist.  You see some of them, and you can see how it might upset the subject of these cartoons.  But for these politicians to use their positions to drag Larry Flynt through legal mud and into jail on a free speech issue is a total abuse of power.  Seems our government's been totally corrupt for a good long while, and for sure it ain't getting any better.

Before viewing this, I had no particular opinion on Larry Flynt, and even though I don't enjoy it personally, I am not against pornography.  Hey, if you like it watch it.  Anyway, in detailing the history of Hustler - certainly the most hardcore of porn magazines, Larry Flynt reveals himself as an astute businessman.  He looked over the newsstand and saw that magazines like Playboy and Penthouse were basically (at least at the time in the 60s) about breasts, so Larry Flynt created a magazine all about the pink (between women's legs).  You do see some nudity in this, but it's minimal.  Anyway, I came away from watching this with real admiration for this porn king.  He was truly passionate about freedom of speech, and watching his defiance against the political machine - even after being shot and paralyzed - was a real turn on for me.  I'm all about the subversive, and people that challenge the status quo.  It's worth noting that a U.S. government official - I assume connected to issues of decency, had this question put before him:  ""What is more obscene - war or pornography?""  The man thought for a long hard minute but could only come up with this:  ""I can't answer that.""  The answer should be a no brainer, and that just shows you the kind of dopes we have running the country.

A fascinating tangent of Flynt's story involves his wife, Althea, who died among the first wave of AIDS deaths.  She had become a heroin user and contracted AIDS through dirty needles (or so Larry believes).  At first, you see Mrs. Flynt looking like a model but also very much the classy Southern lady.  Over time, she becomes downright punk w/ various piercings and a mohawk.  If I have one regret about this film, I would have liked to have learned more about Althea Flynt.

Ultimately, Larry Flynt prevailed, and we as a people have him to thank for fighting his war.",1332115200,,2862,4.6158415841584155
8280370,5,B001AYXFSY,"This is one of the finest biographical documentaries I have ever seen.  While it does not focus much on his early life and the building of the buisiness empire id dives deep into his political impact of defending the 1st amendment and exposing government corruption - he caused three key congressmen to resign, including a speaker of the house elect!!  There is the comming to Jesus, then the return, the battle with Jerry Falwell and the subsequent college tour together and that little tidbit of finding a copy of Hustler in the hotel room when Jimmy Swagart was caught with the prostitute in Batton Rough LA.",1286755200,7,611,4.754716981132075

Be grateful. I am.
This is a good video for anyone that wants more detail on the facts of the situation. I strongly suggest it's watching for anyone in any industry that needs this protection.",1282953600,10,248,4.413043478260869
8280372,4,B001AYXFSY,"I'm not a big fan of Hustler Magazine and really knew little about Larry Flynt, its publisher, other than the Feature Film, which starred Woody Harrelson as Flynt. Hustler is not a magazine I buy, but then no one is forcing me to (and most newsstands have the cover images shielded.

Though this is bio of Flynt (more of a profile than a real biography), it's more that that under the surface. It's an indictment of the commercial news networks since William Paley left CBS.

As Flynt explains in the 74 minute film (which has no narrator), Sex and pornography were around in the middle ages, mostly enjoyed by the wealthy. (A look at 17th and 18th century erotica going at auction, and the many versions of the Kama Sutra being sold must say something about Americans' obsession with sex.). Flynt just tries to push the button. He then takes his money and uses it to fight for the civil rights of those who fight for the First Amendment. It's not all about sex either, though it was Flynt using his money to investigate a variety of our lawmakers who were having affairs. And, as we learned from the well-made film, it was because of Flynt that reporters from the major networks were able to be embedded in the war zones to report on the most recent wars.

How the director was able to unearth some great archival footage amazed me. The documentary starts, and ends with Flynt at Harvard Law School where he was given a Free Speech Award (of course there is also Flynt at the Adult Video News awards too!).

You'll hear a few four-letter words - but not a lot - and there is only one topless female (in a sequence on shooting photos for Hustler). But the most obscene scene in the documentary has nothing to do with sex. It's actual footage of maimed bodies during the war in Afghanistan. After seeing these few moments, you will think twice about whether it's obscene to show cartoons of consenting persons having sex.

Don't let Flynt's name dissuade you, nor should you expect to see lots of naked women. If you liked ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", you will like (I hesitate to use the word ""enjoy"") this DVD.

8280373,4,B001AYXFSY,"This biographical documentary chronicles the career of Larry Flynt, from his days as a small time adult business owner in Ohio to wealthy porn kingpin and publisher of America's most controversial magazine.

It begins with some excellent archival footage of Flynt battling the ""Ohio Citizens For Decency"" back in the 70's. From there Hustler magazine goes nationwide and establishes a lucrative market niche by being the first men's magazine to ""show pink"". In the 80's Hustler drew the ire of sex-negative feminists and religious fanatics, like Jerry Falwell, through it's outrageous covers, photo shoots and political satire.

Other subjects covered include the death of Flynt's wife, Althea, due to drugs, the near fatal shooting of Flynt by a white supremacist and Flynt's imprisonment in a pyschiatric ward following his refusal to reveal a source to the FBI.

How much you like this doc will probably depend on how much you like Flynt. The doc is very much geared to portray Flynt as a heroic figure, particularly in his bold struggle for upholding the First Amendment. Despite his shortcomings, I generally agree with this assessment of Flynt as a brave and mostly admirable figure. But those who dislike Flynt will likely see this film as biased and unobjective. Personally, I found it worth watching.",1220227200,3,1309,5.136150234741784
