7749225,5,B01F6EHOVM,"Gibby is an excellent fun to watch family movie.  Kids will throughly enjoy watching Gibby, especially the monkey making the kitchen a mess scene.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gibby/dp/B01F6EHOVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gibby</a>",1471392000,3,272,9.074074074074074
7749226,5,B01F6EHOVM,"So refreshing to see an adorable wholesome movie in this age!  A fun, cute, real family movie for all; Dove seal of approval.  Theme supports a positive method for youth working through loss and young teen issues.  Our family highly recommends.",1471305600,2,244,4.902439024390244
7749227,5,B01F6EHOVM,"Thought this was very cute clean family movie!  My kids absolutely loved the movie, their ages are 7 and 9 years old (both girls).  They loved how the teacher selected who would watch Gibby (the monkey) for the summer and also the dance scene (my kids know this by heart).  Also, they loved the sound at the end.",1471219200,4,312,4.344827586206897
7749228,1,B01F6EHOVM,"After eagerly waiting two years for the Gibby movie to be released in the United States, all I can say is that I am severely disappointed by the final result. Even my eight year old nephews and nieces shrugged in disappointment as we stopped the movie after only twenty minutes because it was all they could watch. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but I would advise any potential customer that this movie is not worth the $10.",1470787200,,429,4.375

8760328,4,B01F6EHOVM,"My daughters love this movie. To be honest they love gymnastics movies and there is not all that many of them. They are in kindergarten and second grade.
This is a great kids movie. It has gymnastics and an adorable little monkey that is funny and enjoyable to watch.
The acting is not fabulous but okay for a kids movie. It is wholesome and fun. The monkey scares people and makes messes that had my girls rolling with laughter.
It teaches kids how to cope with loss and how to deal with mean girls and bullying.",1518393600,,513,4.354166666666667
8760329,5,B01F6EHOVM,"For an obviously not high budget movie, with actors you've never seen in anything before (well the human ones anyway), this is actually quite a fun movie. If you're being put off by the DVD cover which indicates this is a gymnastics movie or even a romance one, don't be, although there are a few times gymnastics comes into the plot, it isn't where most of the action takes place, and although it's obvious a boy likes the main character, she's oblivious to it most of the movie. Gibby is basically the tale of Katie, a girl who is still depressed and has not yet come out of her shell and got back on track with living life to the full, after her mother passed away, becoming obsessed with winning a class essay to allow her to take care of her teacher's pet while the teacher goes on vacation during the school holidays.  That pet is named Gibby, who is a capuchin monkey, and is played by Crystal the Monkey (Night at the Museum movies, second Hangover movie and has appeared in episodes of a heap of TV shows like Community and Malcolm in the Middle).  There's also a sub plot about a gymnastics team bully who is also the school alpha mean girl who is making life a misery for Katie's friends on the gymnastics team.  For some reason the best gymnast becomes the captain for the year, and Katie's friends want her to return to the arena since she can beat the bully so their year ahead will not be a total one of terror.  But Katie is in a state of depression and has no plans on putting on the leotard once again (or basically leaving her house), she is also not noticing the obvious infatuation with her that the good looking boy of the school has on her who keeps asking her if she's going to the school dance which she certainly has no plans to attend.  If she can win the chance of looking after Gibby though, things might change, especially since she is going to have to do a deal with the good looking boy who is somewhat or an expert on monkeys, but whose parents won't let him look after it, if she is to win the pet sitting job.

Even though I'd never heard of the human actors, they do the job they need to for the film to work. This film also doesn't go with the usual Hollywood style of having actors in their mid twenties, thirties or older playing teens.  I don't know for sure of course, but I'm pretty sure these teenagers are actually teenage aged actors. Which I think is somewhat refreshing. The main character Katie (played by Shelby Lyon) came across as a very kind and likable character, which I think made the movie flow well.  Obviously Crystal the Monkey is a superb actor and carries the film, but it wouldn't have worked without the Katie character being likable and not pathetic like some similar plot movies go with for teen girl characters. That doesn't mean the film is perfect.  The acting (well more so the way the character is written and interacts with others) of the bully isn't great and doesn't come across as realistic at all.  Nor do her lame ""you got burned"" sidekicks.  They do go with a realistic looking DJ for the school dance of an old Asian guy, who I assume is also supposed to be the math or science teacher or something (we only visit on classroom where Gibby's owner is the teacher).  But they do also have a fictional famous pop star who for some reason shows up at the dance so the main non bully female students can all do a choreographed dance number to her song for some reason.

Overall it's a fun film, if you're prepared to watch something that's low budget and doesn't have any actors you know (human ones, you'll recognise Crystal), then you won't go wrong with Gibby.",1498262400,,3636,4.376854599406528
