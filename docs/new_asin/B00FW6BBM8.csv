The cinematography is beautiful but as others have stated before me, it's slow in its development hence the drop of a star. I would recommend this as a good watch.",1415491200,,317,4.482758620689655

It was a pleasant surprise compared to other movies I have watch lately!  Don't let the name or the titles photo fool you.  Its not about vampires or anything like that.  It's based on a psychological horror.",1415232000,,338,4.138461538461539

6033326,5,B00FW6BBM8,"An out of the park five!  The cover and name do not match this excellent psychological thrill ride.  I thought it was going to be a horror movie, but it really isn't though there is just a tiny touch of horror genre in it.  The acting by the leading lady is superb.  I was VERY impressed.  It is a truly unique, captivating story line.  But, the acting by Marta Milans backed by Greg Oliver's directing is what really sells this movie and sets it apart.  The pace of the movie and the overall spooky feel brought on by the soundtrack and perfectly soft but sinister ambience with well placed, well timed, ""gotcha's,"" make this a scary classic.",1467331200,,643,4.444444444444445

6033330,3,B00FW6BBM8,"One star for plot, two for storyline, three for narrative, and four for atmosphere - too bad the first category dragged it down.

Overall the movie is mediocre, although I thought the acting was decent and the psychological atmosphere was good. I saw the twists coming a mile away. I would have given it a higher rating despite it being rather run-of-the-mill, but in the end the explanation of what was happening didn't add up (I even went back and checked to make sure), as well as being so far-out that I lost the ability to suspend disbelief. So instead of leaving with a feeling of having spent an evening watching an unremarkable but not regrettable movie, I left feeling miffed that simple aspects of the plot weren't be worked out before they spent money actually filming.",1465689600,,780,4.693430656934306

6033352,4,B00FW6BBM8,"I have just finished viewing this movie, saw the tailer in youtube and it seemed like a standard scary movie for a Friday night, you know just to pass time.

You see this nice movie start the grind of someone that is reliving everyday the grind, like her on very own in-life purgatory trying to achieve her goal.

But days come in and go by and you start to see the toll on the character, so close and so far away from her goal.

The movie borders on slow and repetitive but aided by an amazing lead and intelligent script and nice cinematography and score one decides to soldier on and keep on watching.

A few minutes before the ending you feel it is just a regular zombie, haunted house movie with a predictable end... but just as we come full circle at the end the movie, all the questions you had, all the inconsistencies you thought to have picked through the movie just explain themselves out in an absolutely amazing way.

The grind, the repetitiveness of every day, the sympathy for the lead they are answered and in the end it comes up as a reward to the viewer.

20 minutes before the movie closed I was just thinking to myself, nice little art movie but pretty doesn't make for substance... 4/10... at the end... 8/10... how many movies do you know that not only do not drop the ball at the end much less raise the bar of the movie to a whole other level?

Recommended without a doubt... and if I use JeremyJahns' ratings this is ""Definitely worth buying on bluray""",1449792000,,1477,4.368613138686132

6033358,3,B00FW6BBM8,The title of the movie  (Devoured ) and why the movie poster are completely misleading. I would definetly not comsider this a horror movies but better a paranormal flick with a twist. The entire film is built around the same characters with the exception a nameless few that get sprinkled in here and there to give depth to the story.

Read passed the bad reviews as others have come into this movie expecting a different style of Horror/gore/supernatural thriller. If you have an open mind and do not go into this film with a one track genre mind you will enjoy it.
After watching 2 straight movies prior to this which were all rated 3 stars and ended up being horrible with even worse acting this was a pleasant surprise and a hidden gem. I may have rated it 3 stars myself as it is not placed in the proper genre category but after some real duds rated at 3 stars this deserved more.

6033373,3,B00FW6BBM8,Devoured is a slow paced thriller with supernatural elements.  The story is about a mother working at an upscale NYC restaurant.  She's the cheap laborer who is trying to save up enough money to pay for her sons surgery. That is the basic plot line in a basically carelessly done film you don't care for their actors/actress the protagonists as a matter of fact no one cares about anyone else it makes no sense. Supernatural scenes are thrown in for no reason and no explanation is given why. I would steer away from this because it is a total waste of time. I give it a three only because of the main character he's the only decent actor in this film.,1443139200,,652,4.380165289256198

That Americans are bad, they use people, and immigrants are good.  I felt like this was an attempt to make heroes out of illegals/immigrants while demonizing, mostly white, Americans.  I don't get why everyone at this restaurant 'hated' her, yet she kept her job.  That part made zero sense.

Now, that propaganda aside, the horror aspect of the movie was pretty good, but it was few and far in between.

6033391,5,B00FW6BBM8,"This is terrific. Don't - I repeat DON'T - pass this by because of the movie poster, because this isn't a gorefest. I mean, I like over-the-top horror every so often, but 'Devoured' is like someone took the best of psychological thrillers, slow-building horror, and human tragedy, blended the ingredients to perfection, and served up this movie.

My gore comment aside, there IS a big horror 'payoff' at the end - and it was completely believable. And brutal. And crushingly sad...This movie EARNED that ending. Wow.

Other thoughts:
1. Marta Milans needs to be cast a LOT. She was incredible.
2. This reminded me of 'Jacob's Ladder' in a lot of ways, except that this was a lot more claustrophobic - you really get a feel for just how trapped she is.
3. The title works on so many levels. Whoever picked it wins.

6033406,5,B00FW6BBM8,"If you're looking for a genuine ghost story or anything paranormal or gory (of the Texas Chainsaw variety), take a pass on this. It won't be your thing. But if you like a genuine psychological thriller with creepy elements, you should like this. I don't want to include any spoilers, but I'll just say that the human mind and what it does (or doesn't do) to cope with the unacceptable is what drives this film. Part of the ending I predicted, but certainly not all of it, and I was genuinely surprised. There are some good jump scares as well. I rooted for the main character throughout so, unlike one top reviewer here, I actually DID care about her at the end--even though you know from the very start that it will not end well for her. You just have to be able to track the action and it will all make sense. The piano music throughout sets the somber tone just perfectly and gets foreboding in just the right moments.

Flaw (or random misdirection):  the woman friend chatting at the bar with our protagonist. Everyone else in the film, you know why they're there, even if they are a figment of her imagination or a memory--at least eventually. The woman seems to be a loose end who could've easily been edited out.

I couldn't handle all that drama so I didn't finish it. If you like that sort of thing and you like horror you'll probably love this movie. The horror elements were pretty well done from what I saw.

The character development is really subpar - the information given about the people is extremely brief and cookie cutter. You have your good guys and your bad guys, and it is literally spelled out for you. No real surprises until the end, and I had already kind of figured it out to an extent.

The slasher movie fans will not find this to their liking. The cover and description implies more horror and gore than you will find in this film. What you will find is a well acted indie movie that defies being stereo typed or classified so the marketers pushed the horror/slasher content. But really it is more of a psychological thriller with elements of horror.
It differs from the norm as far as today's horror movies go. It has an intricate plot with a few very creatively done twists in the end. The lead actress was exceptional. Just beware of the way it's advertised; you have to be able to follow a storyline.",1423353600,23,746,4.492647058823529

The lead, Marta Milans, is really a great actress and could portray a range of emotions with just her expressions.  This movie is slow to build but it's consistent in that build up with no dead spaces so it made me want to continue watching until the very explosive ending. I think it's probably easy to figure out what's going on thus making it somewhat predictable simply because of the form the makers chose to use as her 'stalker'.  If they had used just a black shadow and not shown the face, it would have been harder to figure that out.  I give this such a high rating for several reasons: Milans wonderful acting, the believable plot, the emotional aspect, the use of an explosive ending juxtaposed against a quiet and slow-building storyline.",1423094400,14,870,4.551282051282051

For a movie with scarce plot or dialog, it feels bogged down with its subplots, only some of which pan out in the end. One worthless subplot is the lead's cute little romance with the coffee-bringing guy. Are we supposed to hope he can help her out of the situation in the end and then they'll be together and her son will get the operation he needs so we can have a happy ending? But the movie starts out with our lead dead in the restaurant. So yeah, that's not going to happen. Just like me giving Devoured a good review.

This film has wonderful production quality, I could see it in theaters easily if the pacing were adjusted. The music stayed with me long after and the story kept drawing me back the next day to figure out what happened and where. This IS a bit of a complex movie to digest at first go. So expect to be lost unless you watch to the very end.

The story revolves around a woman who is so desperate to get money for her son's operation, she works in a crappy job late at night cleaning a restaurant. She is surrounded by harsh co-workers, sexist drunk men, and worst of all, a dark force that seems intent on scaring this woman to death.

The plot doesn't advance much beyond that for almost the entire movie, but to understand WHY everything is happening, you must see this to the end.

As for maturity, we like to screen horror movies for our sons who enjoy them. We don't let them watch any movie with extreme fowl language, nudity or any kind of sex. This movie had 2 f-words and a handful of sex scenes. No nudity, but the scenes were graphic enough that you knew what was happening.

Still, a great late night horror flick that will stick with you long after you watch.",1416528000,,1440,4.240875912408759
6033504,5,B00FW6BBM8,"I have to admit, this is a very good movie for a low budget flick! I can usually guess the plot half way through the movie but I was totally surprised at the end.",1416441600,,162,3.7941176470588234
6033505,4,B00FW6BBM8,"This is not a horror movie. This is about mental illness with the illusion of horror. The main character reminded me of someone living with a serious PTSD. The ghostly images were a representation of the conflict between good and evil. Working to save money for her son's operation so he won't die is very honorable, and the more so as a cleaning lady in a restaurant. The movie keeps you guessing,but close observations of particular scenes lead me to know what was going to happen. I gave four stars because the acting was good,the composition of scenes flowed smoothly,and a soft touch on someone with extreme psychosis.",1416441600,,623,4.777777777777778

6033511,2,B00FW6BBM8,Just wanted to point something out that was at the beginning of the movie.  At 1:24 watch the supposedly dead girls neck and you can see it move and twitch and if you watch even closer you can see her breathing.  I guess life like fake corpses were too expensive for this film crew.,1416009600,,282,4.203703703703703
6033512,4,B00FW6BBM8,"This movie reminded me of Dark Water quite a bit. I was at first confused as to whether she was doing the cooking, the cleaning or if she was working in a hotel because I didn't see why a bunch of security cameras were necessary for a restaurant. Marta Milans can certainly act, and she can even sing. She has a strong resemblance to singer Andrea Corr in good lighting. In bad lighting she can look monstrous which was really interesting. She does a great job of portraying a woman who, with hard work, no money and a sick little boy and mother to care for, her prettiness will soon be gone and she deserves better than sinking deeper into the depths every day.

My first disconnection was that if she were so poor, how could she have a cellphone and be making long distance calls to El Salvador from NYC every day? My second was why would she be in NY in this terrible job, probably having come through much hardship already as an immigrant, only to make money to get back to El Salvador, when she wanted to bring her family to NY?

She also didn't seem to do much cleaning except in one respect and I have never seen a custodian stand behind the bar like that with customers in the place. The hostess/manager/owner was typical evil stepmother penny-pinching type, all smileys to the customers and rotten to the staff.

I feel this film cheated a bit on the plot because even at the end you're not certain of the order of events, or if it happened all in one day. I don't think mixing up the scenes added anything to the movie. Four stars are really for creepy atmosphere and acting, the use of video and stairs, and general grittiness and feeling low-ness. I'd say creepy or menacing more than scary. There is horror. Of several kinds.",1416009600,5,1738,4.40809968847352
6033513,5,B00FW6BBM8,"DEVOURED opens w/ the NYPD discovering a dead woman named Lourdes (Marta Milans) on the floor of a restaurant. As police investigate, the action switches to the story of what led to this scene. Lourdes was a mother, working a night-shift cleaning job at the restaurant. She's been sending her wages home to El Salvador, so her desperately ill son can get an operation. As the nights pass, Lourdes begins to see haunting images and bizarre, seemingly supernatural phenomena. She's also been doing a bit of ""side work"" for far more than her usual pay! This all leads to a final shocker, as the truth is revealed and everything spins completely out of control. DEVOURED is a suspenseful creeper w/ several nice jolts and twists. Milans is fantastic in her unhinged role, and the finale is just plain bonkers!...",1416009600,8,808,4.820143884892087

6033516,5,B00FW6BBM8,"It's not a typical horror movie. In fact it's a very realistic view of the tough life of an immigrant in the big city struggling to save enough money for her sons operation. She works for a boss from hell whose two timing boyfriend can't keep his hands to himself and all the scumbag patrons try and take advantage of her situation.
You really feel sorry for her and you get the distinct impression that she just had enough of the BS and snapped.
In fact the dark spirits are only alluded to in there most casual way.
It's a horror film that actually contains some serious socially redeeming value.",1415750400,7,598,4.445454545454545

6033520,5,B00FW6BBM8,"Usually I'm sure how I'll rate a movie well before I'm halfway in. I think a lot of critics here start by presuming three stars and add up or down in their heads. Because I have great luck and intuition with movies, I usually assume five stars and subtract as needed. By the time I was halfway through, I was at three stars and considering two. So what happened to change my mind to five? All I can say is be patient with this one. No spoilers here.",1415491200,3,449,4.113636363636363
6033521,5,B00FW6BBM8,"It's hard to tell from the film cover and description that this is really an ""artsy"" horror movie--not in the sense of intellectual obscurity --but in the cinematography; i.e. the way the camera dwells on certain images, objects, and people. The viewer can't distinguish between reality and fantasy in some instances, exactly like the character; we don't know if the frights are in her head, our head, or real depictions. Even the security monitor images make us wonder because some of what the viewer might think of as delusions are also captured on the monitor. Is she delusional or is the restaurant really haunted? Who's real and who's imagined? Will a ghost pop out of that painting, or the subway, or the sink? We don't know and that's where the suspense keeps popping. It all adds up in the end and the high tension dissolves like a sigh of relief. The soundtrack is lovely and perfectly reflects the action and mood.",1415491200,,924,4.745341614906832
