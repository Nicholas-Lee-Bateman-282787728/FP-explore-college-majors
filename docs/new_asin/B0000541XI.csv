1393123,5,B0000541XI,"This is one of the best series I have ever seen.  In true anime fashion, it opens with slapstick humor that slowly, like a fine wine, matures into a humorous commentary on life and humanity, still interspersed with silly bits more carefully chosen than in the beginning.
If you have seen anime of the space battleship genre (Yamato/Star Blazers, Captain Harlock, Macross), or know about the military, this series will be all the more hilarious as the references and spoofs are brilliantly executed.
This is the first full anime series I have bought; it is definitely worth the price.  And RightStuf, the producing company, fixed the 4th disc problem.

1393124,5,B0000541XI,"Ever since I saw Tylor in the original japanese with subs on an old VHS cassette, i was hooked. this is not only funny, but a great series for everyone to watch... my wife and I thoroughly enjoy watching this series, because it appeals to everyone... and I would say that I am a pretty committed anime fan, too...
its worth adding to your collection",998438400,4,349,4.384615384615385
1393125,5,B0000541XI,"I really enjoyed this series, from the silly antics of Capt. Taylor, to the serious additudes of the crew. This was a well thought out series, from the 1st episode to the last. I suggest this to anyone who enjoys comedies, startrek, or any scifi. This was dubbed very well and the voice actor are familiar if you've seen slayers dubbed (you should recognize the voice actor for Capt. Taylor). I recommend this series to everyone.",997056000,,429,4.657894736842105
1393126,5,B0000541XI,"First things first, BUY THIS BOX SET. I'd never heard of captain tylor until i read the reviews from zack davidson, vincent vu and steve ressel, and i was sold (I don't think they could put it any better). This is probably one the best anime series i've seen, i think i had a smile on my face for the whole 11 hours. It has just the right blend of comedy, romance, action and just a little drama. In short, if you by this series you will not be disappionted.",993600000,3,458,4.1
1393127,5,B0000541XI,"It's pretty hard to categorize ""Irresponsible Captain Tylor,"" just like it is hard to pin down Justy Ueki Tylor himself.  As it says on the cover, he is ""either a certified genius or a complete fool, but no one can really tell.""
The series itself is equal parts funny, sad, thought provoking, sweet, romantic and nostalgic.  There is nothing unique about these elements other than perhaps the way they all work together to make one of the best anime series I have ever seen.  Each of the characters are rounded out and developed, and you just get to LIKE them all so much that it is sad when the last episode plays.  Not because anything bad happens to them so much as you will miss them.
I consider this series to be on par with Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of sheer quality.  That's a pretty good recommendation.",989884800,12,818,4.5
1393128,5,B0000541XI,"Imagine putting Dave Lister in charge of the Enterprise, with Arnold Rimmer as his first officer and you would end up with The Irresponsible Captain Tylor. This series had me laughing from the first episode to the last. Although there was one episode were close friend of Tylor dies which was quite poignant. But, after that, it's back to the silliness. To paraphrase Zelgadis of the Slayers (whose english voice actor, Crispin Freeman, also the english voice of Tylor), ""Did you think they would let us make this series serious without a fight?""
The humor comes not from slapstick silliness, but from the interactions of the characters. Polar opposites forced to coexist. Tylor, the undisplined slacker, constantly at odds with Yamamoto and Yuriko, the displined pride of the UPSF. Kojiro, who's deathly afraid of girls, having the cute Hanner twins constantly teasing him. The unruly bunch of veteran marines whose attempt at harming their Captain always seems to be interrupted by an untimely enemy attack.
The english voice acting was suprisingly good. I dare say the enjoyed the dubbing as much as the subtitled version. I can't wait until the Right Stuf release the OAV on DVD later on this year.",986428800,4,1202,4.985074626865671

7930766,3,B0000541XI,"I received a bootleg from the seller. The outer box looked fine but the dvd cases, the video quality and the GOLD bottomed discs all screamed bootleg to me. I compare the small words in the inner rings with the real thing and it doesnt say the same thing. The discs where RITEK!

The series is just ok, some funny moments but overall just an average anime. Great Spanish (mex) Dub though.",1386374400,,388,4.388888888888889
7930767,3,B0000541XI,"I heard a lot about this one and had high hopes for it. I was expecting something along the lines of Outlaw Star, but with more camp and parody along the lines of Excel Saga thrown in. What really happens is you get a serious drama, led by a bafoon along the lines of Jack Tripper or Frank Drebin as the lead. And this could have worked so well, and it did on some levels, but there is not enough resolution. I loved the antics of the marines and the pilot (why there was only one starfighter pilot seemed odd to me). I loved the fact that the enemy was actually a competant enemy and that the stakes were actually high, and lives really on the line. But it annoyed me that Tylor really was an idiot, and never got it, even in the end. Once the climax actually came, he never became more then he was to start with, and so many people were disapointed and love lost. In the end, I felt as if it were all for nothing, but I understand this was only the beginning and much more of the series follows. But I don't know if I have the faith in Tylor to invest more into the series, because of what I have seen so far. I feel like one of the disapointed crew of the Soyokaze.",1151107200,2,1168,4.038793103448276
7930768,5,B0000541XI,"The Irresponsible Captain Tylor series is just what it's title suggests.  Tylor joins the United Planets Space Force.  Why?  Because they will pay him and feed him and he won't have to do anything.  Tylor is truly irresponsible. Or is he?  As the series unfolds, and war comes to the universe, we follow Tylor in his adventures, as he becomes a Captain of a old ship and a mis-matched batch of unwanted soldiers, pilots and crewmembers.

Is he really irresponsible or is he the only person who happens to be sane and comfortable with himself?  This is as much sci-fi as it is philosophy and I really started to enjoy it - but then is ended.  Lucky for me, there is a OVA and, I believe, a few movies.  I plan to grab them.

26 episodes and OK for most ages.  Crispin Freeman at his best - he's Tylor's English voice and it sounded like he REALLY enjoyed it.",1105056000,3,857,4.327044025157233
7930769,5,B0000541XI,Captain Tylor is the best anime I've seen since Cowboy Bebop. And it is just as good!,1082419200,,85,4.0588235294117645
7930770,5,B0000541XI,"I'm not going to go into to much detail with my review. All I would like to say is that The Irresponsible Captain Tylor is a rare type of Anime. Its the kind where you laugh, but at the same time feel that you have come away from it having learned something. Its hard to explain. But what I will say is the world would be a better place if more people had Tylor's attitude.
The series is laugh out loud funny and rich with characters. Sometimes certain characters are left out of the loop and are underused or undercharacterized but its not enough to take away from this series.
The over all story is really enjoyable and the Final battle is very intense, and the victory OUTSTANDING!!!
This series also has one of the most satisfying endings I have ever encountered and left me wishing it never ended (there is the OVA series you can watch after this, a sequel of sorts, to the first series).
The extras on the DVD are wonderful, ships schematics (ALL of them, even ships seen for 2 seconds in the series), character synopsis, music videos, and more.
I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a good anime series and to people who want to get a taste of what anime has to offer. I highly recommend this to everyone you will not be disapointed!!",1053043200,4,1249,4.364806866952789
7930771,5,B0000541XI,"This review is partially a direct review of the series and partially a response to other reviews read here.
If you don't like a series that goes over-the-top, you won't like ICT.
If you don't like blatant denial of probability and how things actually work, you won't like ICT.
If you don't like humerous character stereotypes taken to and beyond the extreme, you won't like ICT.
I love this show.  I first purchased it used on VHS several years ago from a comic store I had some in-store credit with. Irresponsible Captain Tylor is purposefully and blatantly overboard with its wackiness and characters.  I guess it is possible to find this annoying, as at least one reviewer on here did, but this characteristic is really the entire point of the series.  Tylor's mind-numbingly constant good luck is not a crappy plot gap, it's a cornerstone of the series, as are the niches filled by the characters around him.
There's really nothing in this series you could change to improve it, not because it's the best anime ever (though it's one of my favorites) but because changing it would destroy everything it's trying to be.
Probably none of this matters or makes sense to you and you're all going to click the little ""this reveiw did not help me at all"" button underneath, but as far as I'm concerned, you can't find a better comedy anime than Irresponsible Captain Tylor.",1030406400,17,1370,4.7238493723849375
7930772,5,B0000541XI,This is by far the best anime series I have seen. It combines clever humor with original characters. I wish I had discovered this series earlier. You won't regret this purchase.,1011657600,,177,4.741935483870968
7930773,5,B0000541XI,"I had high expectations for this anime, when my friend handed it to me and told me it was great. I put it in, pressed play, and for the first 2 shows, I didn't think it was that good. But then I started liking its slapstick humor and its strange script. I wouldnt expect alot from this show, but you will grow to love the show. Dont expect great depth, huge character devolpment, or a innovative plot. Just expect a simple quarky show thats really funny.",1007596800,,454,4.290697674418604
7930774,5,B0000541XI,"Some people, I think, have difficulty imagining that an animated series based on idiocy, slapstick humor, and general gaffs can be considered ""intelligently scripted."" The series really does go in directions that nobody expects. The dialogue is top notch, as is the quality of animation. It will mostly have you laughing and shaking your head, but it will sometimes tug at you a bit in its more sentimental moments.
Watch Tylor in a group. It's great fun when everybody laughs in the same room. This isn't anime as I would have written it...it's anime as I never thought of before! I can't wait to see the OVAs.",1005350400,,611,4.719626168224299
