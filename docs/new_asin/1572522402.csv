189942,4,1572522402,"The first time I saw Sam Kinison was in the Rodney Dangerfield film Back to School. Sam just had a small bit as the unbalanced Professor Terguson, but he almost stole the show. I made a mental note to keep an eye out for this raving, original comedian. The next few years brought lots of laughs and surprises.

The strengths in this excellent film are its recounting of Sam's standup career and the interviews with a group of comedians on what made Sam different from everyone else in the comedy business. One gets a good sense of how Sam's originality contributed to his success in a difficult business. The film includes some great clips of Sam's act and his appearance in Dangerfield's Back to School. Why Did We Laugh also recounts Rodney Dangerfield's role in Sam's success.

If there is a missed opportunity in this film, I think it is that the filmmakers do not go quite far enough into Sam's dark side. The viewer gets an idea of the demons that drove Kinison's comedy, but there is not enough material on the experiences that motivated him. There is one clip from Sam's routine in which he says that, before his birth, he was happy, floating in a place where there was no pain. Then Sam begins to SCREAM at his parents for bringing him into this world. To me, that was a fascinating bit that revealed a lot.

I think that it is fair to say that Sam's career had cooled off a bit by the time that he died. Why Did We Laugh? recounts Kinison's excesses with drugs and alcohol. The film, however, does not recount the poor decisions that Sam made, in particular his disastrous fight with ""super agent"" Michael Ovitz when Kinison refused to do a movie that Ovitz wanted him to do. Kinison's prospects in the movies dimmed considerably after that fight.

Why did we laugh? In the end, I think that Kinison was a true rarity - a show business (and American) original. The fact that he managed to discuss taboo issues in an era when nothing is supposed to be shocking certainly did not hurt his career. Whatever one thinks of Kinison's comedy, he was a fascinating person. I recommend this film.",1262563200,4,2097,4.525065963060686
