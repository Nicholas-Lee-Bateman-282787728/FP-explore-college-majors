It is a 70 min DVD, but would be even better on a 2 hr bluray. With more coverage of  the box art, and more views of the variations of items.  I would like to see more footage of the rare trains operating, but I am not sure if those are just display only.  Mr DeSantis seems very nice, and is very interesting  when he speaks about how he accumulated the collection. Would be nice to hear more tells of collecting, he probably has hundreds. Great anecdotes in general. Special thanks to Mr DeSantis to allowing this to be filmed for others to enjoy.  WHAT A COLLECTION!!!!",1475193600,,715,4.412213740458015
8541106,4,B009G74M7A,"If you're reading this, you're probably familiar with vintage electric trains and Tom McComas's other videos.  This one pretty much follows the same formula he's used through all of his videos, so if you like those, you'll like this one.  Having said that, the De Santis collection deserves a different type of video than this - we will never again see a collection like this assembled, probably ever.  The man literally has every single variation of every single standard gauge item ever made, LITERALLY, from Dorfan, to Lionel, to Boucher, to American Flyer, to Ives, to General Trains, to everybody else!  AND, he has an extensive collection of European 1 gauge trains, and early Carlisle & Finch, Voltamp, Elektoy, you name it!  I've never seen a collection this complete and this huge before.

There is some interesting interview stuff with De Santis, who is very humble about his gigantic collection and it is fantastic to hear him talk about learning from the true pioneers in the hobby of tinplate trains and getting his first pieces out of parts boxes at local hobby shops back when nobody wanted the stuff.  Still, I'd very much like to see a MUCH MORE detailed examination of the collection, with attention paid to the truly exotic items like the multiple Boucher Blue Comet sets he has, the Carlisle & Finch pieces, the MANY white Ives sets he has, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  It would take a two-hour video just walking along the walls of this collection and pointing out some of the extreme rarities in there to do it justice.  Instead, there's too much time given to filming his layout with the same three or four downright common trains he has making laps (which we've all seen a thousand times), passing the same common Lionel accessories, each of which Tom decides needs narration again - like anybody needs to know anything else about a Hellgate Bridge at this point?

It's well worth getting because it's the only look I've seen at the world's most impressive tinplate collection, but I'd love for somebody to get in there and produce a two or three hour video with just De Santis showing off the premier pieces he's managed to accumulate.",1438819200,,2172,4.752659574468085
