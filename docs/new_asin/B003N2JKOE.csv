8400583,5,B003N2JKOE,"Super series.  I have volumes 1-16 and plan on getting the rest.  These movies of Roy and Dale bring back memories of my childhood when I used to play Roy, and my cousin played Dale.  We both had horses, and Roy Rogers' gun sets.  Those were the days when Heroes were actually heroes and willingly served as positive role models.  When I have grandchildren, I look forward to setting down on Saturdays and watch these movies with them.",1416096000,,435,4.5256410256410255
