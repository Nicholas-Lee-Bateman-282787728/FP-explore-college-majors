2639915,3,B000HRMAM2,"I've enjoyed working out with Mr. Blanks thus far, but the bands for this work out are ridiculous.  I did the workout a week ago, and I still have clear bruising on my biceps.  The bruises on my left arm look terrible.  It looks like I've been beaten or something.  And because of the location, it looks bad for my husband.  It looks like he grabbed me really hard on my upper arms, which he would never do.

The workout is mediocre at parts while at other times it's pretty good.  The second time I did this workout, I left the bands off and used hand weights instead.  If you want a superb ab workout though, hit up P90X.

I would suggest this DVD if you are looking for a different ab routine than what you're already doing.  It's great to toss in there to spice things up.  But the first two DVD's for Billy's Boot Camp are much better than this one.",1254182400,2,854,4.177914110429448
2639916,3,B000HRMAM2,I'm been using Billy's products for 6 years and I love them. Using the bands with this product is cumbersome. It takes some getting used to. In fact I tried using the old black bands instead of the elite bands and it was still very cumbersome. The bands showed signs of wear after doing the workout a few times and I'm not sure if the workout caused the wear and tear or if this was an existing condition. In any event today I made some modification to the workout in that I used Billy's amped bar and some ankle weights. Wow the workout was great. The ankle weights really work the abs nicely. You can also try using hand grip weights instead of the amped bar. Based on making adjustments I would recommend the product. If you just want to use the bands then I cannot really recommend the workout. The workout without the use of any equipment would also be a waste of money.,1252540800,,875,4.3090909090909095
2639917,5,B000HRMAM2,"I love this dvd! It's definitely challenging, but that's the point. With other workouts, I don't always feel the abs have been worked as hard as they should be - that's definitely not the case here. I don't love the bands, so use hand-held weights instead and it works just as well. Quick, visible results - I highly recommend it!",1233187200,3,330,4.516666666666667
2639918,1,B000HRMAM2,"I am a fit taebo user and turned this video off mid way it was so painful.  I'm not talking good workout pain, I'm talking pain!  The bands are terrible, they dig painfully and deeply into your arms and legs, rip out your hair, and leave indentations from digging in so deep.

If you feel you just have to do this video, leave the bands behind or prepare to have some bruises the next day.",1170979200,7,389,4.16
8140790,5,B000HRMAM2,"If I read about these damn bands one more time!!

Ok let's get serious, you do not need the bands, I have 1 lb gloves but if I need extra burn, I add 2 lb weights and get a kick ass workout! ( i DO HAVE P24/7 BANDS BUT AM NOT A FAN OF BANDS).

I do Tae Bo six days a week and in great shape. I also do Ab workout at least 5 of those days so there is no room for soreness since my body is used to it....WRONG! This workout brought the soreness out today after I did this yesterday. The workout itself is 26 minutes long then a cool down. Pretty good AB workout, don't bother with the bands, just a pair of hand weights will get you sweating

Overall, very happy , as usual with Billy's workouts.",1473811200,,694,3.839160839160839
8140791,5,B000HRMAM2,This is the 2nd time I am buying this DVD. I had my first one for years and used it so often that it got quite badly scratched. Love this workout.,1439769600,,146,3.7419354838709675

8140795,5,B000HRMAM2,"Billy Blanks always makes good videos, you get a great work out with Billy Blanks.  I would recommend this video",1393200000,,112,4.6
8140796,5,B000HRMAM2,Awesome! I always turn to this when I have an event coming up! I have high hips and this seems to be one of the only things that make them slim down!,1371600000,,149,3.6875
8140797,3,B000HRMAM2,"Even though it's supposed to be concentrated on abs, I still would like a bit more diversity. I didn't think I'd get as much cardio as I got. It makes you puff. Pace is too fast often, I am afraid that contributes to doing it with momentum vs muscles. I wouldn't buy this dvd,  there are better ones out there.",1325116800,,310,4.166666666666667
8140798,5,B000HRMAM2,"I disagree with the other reviews but maybe that's all to do with where you are in your physical fitness.  I have not used bands with this workout and this seems to be the other reviewers main complaint.  I do the whole workout without the bands and it is fun, energetic without bouncing all around the house, and it DOES work your abs out.  I have used so many different dvd's and this one is definatley my current number one.  The day after you do this workout for the first time you will be very achy but within a few days you will be just fine and if your like me you'll want to do it all over again.

8140799,1,B000HRMAM2,I've been a billy blanks workout fan off and on for a few years. I tried others but always come back to Billy. I purchased the elite with the bands and of the 3 dvds (mission 1 mission 2 and mission 3) this was the worst..I tried and tried the workout over and over I thought it was just me but I never felt it in the abs except some floor work but mostly in my thighs and arms. I definitely stopped using the bands because they bruised me so instead I used hand weights. Don't get me wrong I love the Tae Bo workouts just not this one for the first time I found a Billy Blanks workout I didn't like.,1272844800,,600,3.9262295081967213
