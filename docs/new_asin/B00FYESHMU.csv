6038862,5,B00FYESHMU,"Cheesy, surreal steampunk sci-fi, just good enough to not be bad. Story plays like a young Terry Gilliam idea for a Tales from the Darkside story. Not many gems like this to be found. Relish it like a newly discovered early Dr Who episode and you can forgive the obtuse ending.",1473292800,2,277,4.450980392156863
6038863,4,B00FYESHMU,I don't understand the negative reviews of this film.  It's a well done psychological horror film done with 3 actors.  Perhaps not as taught of an ending as it could have been but it kept my interest just the same.  Not much budget or CGI if that is what you expect but it does a lot with very little.,1472947200,3,301,4.067796610169491
6038864,1,B00FYESHMU,"There's no real story here. It's inane. Waiting for something of significance, some bit to tie the posturing, the presentation together. Surprisingly, the acting wasn't bad, but there's no story here. play actin without purpose. Like the other reviewer, I am disgusted that Amazon would put such crap in it's line up. I'd not pay for this. I watched to the end expecting something...",1471651200,2,383,5.0
6038865,1,B00FYESHMU,Quickly fast forward to the end. Why would amazon put this garbage on here. After watching this I wanted my monthly subscription paid for by Amazon.,1471651200,2,148,4.730769230769231
6038866,3,B00FYESHMU,"The blurb for this looked interesting so despite the bad reviews I 'd read I thought I'd give it a chance and I'm glad I did. Don't get me wrong this film won't set the world alight, but it has an interesting premise and while it doesn't quite deliver it does do enough to provide an entertaining watch.

Outpost 11 is set in an alternate history where steam power still rules the world and Britain and Prussia are fighting the second 100 years war. The war is global and in an isolated base deep in the arctic circle three British soldiers are monitoring Prussian radio communications. There's a mysterious power core on the base and strange events start to put a strain on the three soldiers.

The biggest problem with the film is the production level, it lacks polish. The three actors do a reasonable job with their roles and their descent into madness comes across well. The lack of budget is very evident and while it doesn't prevent the film from telling its story, it does prevent it from really shining. In many ways it feels more like a play than a film with the intimate setting and character led development.

All in all I enjoyed it, it didn't realise its potential but it did enough to keep me watching and overall it did have some interesting ideas and some excellent moments (like the spider alliance).",1390694400,4,1318,4.552742616033755

6038869,4,B00FYESHMU,"I actually liked this movie.  It's not for everyone, and there is a good bit of mystery and ambiguity, but I think that is intentional.  I take away a point because I believe the ending was intended to provide some clarity, but misses the mark.  Still, it held my attention, which is not true for a lot of the films available today.",1486166400,,332,4.32258064516129

6038877,2,B00FYESHMU,"While the production was high on this movie, the story was just to bizare to follow. You don't really get many clues or guidance on what's happening to the characters. Maybe they (the film makers) didn't want to spoil anything, or give you a chance to figure it out on your own before the end of the movie.

The ending wasn't much help to conclude anything either.",1484006400,2,364,4.432835820895522

6038882,2,B00FYESHMU,Kind of an odd supposed science fiction movie and it was that oddness that kept me watching it through to the end.  Very little is actually explained and the ending kind of just stops.  My conclusion after the end was that I didn't like it and will not watch it again.,1481846400,3,268,4.235294117647059

6038885,3,B00FYESHMU,It was a little quirky.  More of a psycho thriller that left you filling in the story line and plot from your own imagination.,1478390400,,126,4.25

6038901,5,B00FYESHMU,"Being a 2 star rating I wasn't expecting much, but was immediately taken by the quality and artistic styling. While the effects were a bit off, the use of stop motion in one particular scene was brilliant, in others it was likely just a cost savings choice. I don't feel it detracts from the movie, so no stars removed for that. This is a movie for a curious mind to explore the visceral story, and probably not something for the mainstream audience. That being said, if you have eclectic or odd tastes in movies this one might be for you. It's well worth the watch.",1475366400,5,566,4.4

8619417,1,B00FYESHMU,"Well that was a waste of time.

Why did this show up as an Amazon recommended movie?
That's probably the slowest B movie I ever saw with no point behind why they even made it..

I watched through the end thinking it might get better but it never does.

It drags on and on and then adds fake spiders here and there for no reason.
That doesn't even make sense in a war movie set in the past, in a remote ""arctic"" region about a war that doesn't exist.

99% is filmed in one room of a small building.
Since it's remote there's no roads, other buildings or people and nothing much happens.
One guy shoots a rabbit, but then the rabbit blows up.  I see.

The endless, pipe-banging, sci-fi type background audio gets annoying and lasts for the entire film.

I kept expecting something to happen and a master plot to eventually explain the fragmented scenes and lack of a plot but it doesn't.
Finally it says they're mad.  So we don't know which scene's were imagined and who died or not.

Lastly, it uses random gore to try to hold interest rather than having content or a purpose.

For example.. the young guy gets his eyes burned out, that's just sad.
Another loses a hand, the ""yes sir yes sir"" military guy has a fake spider growing under his skin (but why?) Who thought of that?
and the 3rd fellow gets gut shot.  Later it shows a guy with his head shot in half, and it just stays there sitting up while blown in half.

Eventually they explain the random images and gore with the story that they're mad.  So maybe it didn't happen.

Cheap effects and pointless gore might be ok occasionally if it made sense and had a story to tell.
But there isn't one.",1498262400,3,1652,4.3042071197411005
8619418,1,B00FYESHMU,I watch all sorts of movies from mainstream to b rated and c rated. This movie footage qaulity yeah it was good. The story line horrible actually non existent and im opend minded. I pretty much like every move i watch in some form but this i couldn't even a little bit. THIS WAS A HUGE WASTE OF TIME TO WATCH THIS NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. ITS HORRIBLY TERRIBLE if i could give it 0 stars i would.,1496707200,,394,4.0
8619419,4,B00FYESHMU,"The four stars are a ""in contrast to the junk"" rating. The film is slow going for the most part, but there is considerable attention to detail. The ending appears mysterious. But, I think the film is essentially a surreal commentary on war, with the ""Omega"" machine the outpost is operating being the clue.
Spoilers: Other clues emerge such that the outpost is conducting some kind of research and that it is under ""psychotropic"" attack, which is evidently non-stop, judging by the blinking light. One can only conclude that the outpost and the soldiers ARE the research. Evidently, cranking up the omega machine to 100% also resets their local reality. Like you, the watcher, the soldiers see little purpose in their mission but try to find comfort in their ordinary activities.
