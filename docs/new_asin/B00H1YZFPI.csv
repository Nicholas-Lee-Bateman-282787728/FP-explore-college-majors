8629143,4,B00H1YZFPI,"Francois Cluzet stars as Yann Kermadec who is taking part in a solo round the World yacht race. He got the opportunity after his boss had an accident, leaving the way open for him to realise his dream of winning the Vende Globe race. Then after a few days out he sustains damage to his boat and has to lay up for repairs off the coast of the Canary Islands.

Though he has lost two days he soon makes up for lost time - then he discovers something that will not only upset his chances of winning but also has the potential to ruin everything. To say any more could be a plot spoiler.

This is a really well made film and would almost make you want to go yachting as it makes it look so much fun - albeit dangerous. Cluzet is his sparkling self and brings a real sense of immediacy to the role. He has to battle the elements and keep in contact with the other competitors as well as his home team; all the time trying to make up for the time he has lost.

If you like boating, or just enjoy a really good human story with some fine acting then this will be one you will want to see.",1424908800,,1081,4.018604651162791
