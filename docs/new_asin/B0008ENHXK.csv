8055748,4,B0008ENHXK,"Thirteen year old Nicholas is introduced right off as a pleasant child, preparing for a party while talking on the phone with his mother who, along with Nicholas's father, is crossing the border with a load of drugs. They appear to be loving parents and a close family, Nicholas may be a bit of a mama's boy. By five minutes into the movie Nicholas's father has been killed in a car crash and they have had his funeral; Nicholas's mother has been arrested for drug trafficking; and Nicholas has been introduced to his foster family.
Nicholas's foster mother seems to be trying a little too hard to make him feel at home, his foster father accepts him and treats him well, but his foster sister does not welcome him. He is immediately bullied at his new school by his foster sister's boyfriend. But when his teacher tells the class the story of Napoleon's prison break Nicholas comes up with the idea of breaking his mother out of prison.
The main plot of the movie is Nicholas's planning the escape. He gets help for a boy he meets at the prison while visiting his mother, the other boy's father is in the prison. He even eventually gets help from his foster sister, although her reason for helping is not clear. Three possible motives for her helping come to my mind, but I will leave that for you to decide as you watch the movie.
The humor mainly comes from Nicholas's ever evolving escape plan, which may seem perfectly rational for a desperate thirteen year old, but from an adult view is often humorous, or at least his methods of preparation and some to the situations he gets himself into are humorous. Even Nicholas's slightly older new friend (the boy he met at the prison) has many doubts about the plan, but continues to help anyway.
The suspense is of course: Will he ever be able to attempt the plan? Will it Work? Will he get caught? And there are other more minor questions adding to the suspense.
The movie is never really exciting, but neither is it dull. The plot moves at a slow, steady pace moving from one problem, or setback, to the next as the plan evolves.
Oh, and by the way, the picture on the front of the DVD case is Nicholas's friend from prison, not Nicholas.",1401235200,,2190,4.491228070175438
8055749,4,B0008ENHXK,"'Grosse btise' or BREAKIN' OUT is another example of how well French films deal with intimate subjects, taking the time to explore emotional attitudes that so often are ignored by Hollywood films.  In this case the extent that true filial love can lead to dangerous consequences is played out in a story that is well written (Stanislas Carr&eacute; de Malberg and Pascal Dupont), well directed (Olivier P&eacute;ray), and well acted by a fine cast.

Nicolas Gu&eacute;rin (Erwan Demaure) is 13-year-old happy son of Laetitia (Isabelle Habiague) and Thierry Gu&eacute;rin who make their living selling drugs.  In the first moments of the film the mother and father are in a car accident, killing the father and resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of the mother for drug trafficking. Nicolas is devastated and immediately begins to think of ways to restore his mother. He is placed in a warm and loving foster home of the Delmas (Christian Crahay and Nathalie Willame) and their adolescent daughter Elodie (St&eacute;phane Caillard).  He is treated well until he enters school where he encounters pier mocking about his mother being a jailbird. One young friend Tanker (Ouassini Embarek), whose own father in jailed for a history of being a gangster, befriends him and quickly becomes a caring confidant and facilitator.

The two lads form a warm friendship and begin to devise ways for Nicolas' mother's escape.  Eventually Elodie becomes involved and the three plan a fake funeral for Nicolas because that is the only way his mother could be temporarily released from prison - to attend her son's funeral!  The plans are complex and the results of the scheme are driven to the extreme with a surprise ending that involves a fruitless run for the border.  The manner in which filial devotion affects each of the film's characters draws some touching conclusions.

Though the film at first appears to condone some anti-social behavior, the sensitivity of the director keeps realistic reins on the story.  In the end this is a fine little film about family and friendship and the benefits and obligations of both. Grady Harp, June 05",1117843200,4,2135,5.056980056980057
