At first raw food prep can seem overwhelming and a bit exotic, but Nomi's detailed demos took a lot of the mystery out of it. I now confidently do a lot of raw food prep, altering things to change flavors as desired (thanks, Nomi!) and have since bought all the tools necessary to make most anything. My non-raw friends are quite impressed and willing to try anything I make now -- even get requests!

Get the book, too!",1358812800,,529,4.29
8190771,4,B000PE4ZRU,In my opinion this DVD is a very good general and comprehensive raw food recipe DVD.  One of the best features of the DVD is starting with one recipe and building that same recipe up into several different options.  The pates are my favorite.  She also provides several cost saving tips around ingredients and kitchen tools  I have purchased about 7 raw food DVDs. My top picks for more general information are Raw Food Made Easy by Jenny Cornbleet and Living on Live Food by Alissa Cohen. Both are currently available through Amazon with a coordinating cook book.  If you can afford to only buy one DVD and not a set of 3 these are good options,1259193600,,645,4.478632478632479
8190772,5,B000PE4ZRU,The DVD is done with professional quality.  Which I like.  She should you how to use the equipment that other people talked you into purchasing for raw food.  I think that makes the DVDs worth the price.  The recipes are excellent.  I like that she shows a base recipe and then how to make different taste.  She uses a lot of sunflower seeds.  With the current cost of nuts that alone can save a ton of money.  Do checkout both of her books.  I have had excellent results with both of them.,1222992000,2,490,4.239130434782608

8190774,5,B000PE4ZRU,"These DVDs are perfect for someone new to the raw food lifestyle and are in perfect sync with Nomi's book of the same name.  Nomi's presentation is down-to-earth and practical...and human.  Nomi presents several basic recipes and then shows how to create even more dishes from them.  I've used her sunflower pate recipe several times as the base for a lot of other recipes.

Many people I talk to, who are really interested, are afraid to begin this raw food way of life because they're afraid that they'll mess up the recipes and get it wrong.  Nomi's information and style of presentation takes the fear out of the equasion.  You see how easy it truly is to create easy, healthful, and extremely delicious meals, virtually in minutes!",1212192000,7,736,4.755905511811024
8190775,5,B000PE4ZRU,Have had Nomi's book for a few years and every recipe I've tried has been delicious. I have a sweet tooth so I especially appreciate her yummy desserts. I have served some of the desserts to guests and they didn't even know it was raw! I just got the 3 DVDs they are very professional looking and Nomi's presentation is very clear. I have been making the breakfast pudding every morning it's so easy and delicious!,1205452800,6,414,4.4605263157894735
