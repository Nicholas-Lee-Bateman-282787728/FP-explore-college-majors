8705159,3,B00UB7YL3O,"This is another wayward kid boot camp film. I was having ""Coldwater"" flashbacks as I was expecting the kids to riot at any moment and kill the adult supervision. The film opens up showing us a girl tied to a bed, apparently molested too and then she is dead. We then shift to a bunch of kids being abducted, because parents driving them to camp would be too realistic and boring. This camp is co-ed. Andrea Briggs (Andrea Burdett) is the wild card in the group as she isn't rowdy like the others, she just acts crazy from time to time. We eventually figure out that Briggs has psychic ability, being able to see events in the past and future. This gives us a hybrid boot camp and ghost story that doesn't do either genre real justice. While the film isn't a stinker, it just didn't grab me as being entertaining. The characters were dry and dialogue unexciting. Soft 3 stars.

Parental guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Implied sex, I assume, by a hand moving up a girl's shirt.",1425513600,,970,4.449438202247191
