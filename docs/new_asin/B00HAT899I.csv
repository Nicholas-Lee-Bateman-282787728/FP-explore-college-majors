8631404,3,B00HAT899I,"Mediocre to poor acting dilutes this film, which otherwise demonstrates decent photography, sets & costumes.  In spite of the claims of significant research there are historical errors, but Hey... it's a MOVIE!",1529971200,,210,5.5625
8631405,5,B00HAT899I,Wow for an 18 min movie it's very well done and acted with an excellent amount of scariness. Man that was barbaric but boy did that witch hunter get a surprise. Has a great ending,1503446400,,179,4.142857142857143
8631406,1,B00HAT899I,This dvd is only 15 minutes long and is not worth the price.,1488844800,,60,3.6923076923076925
8631407,2,B00HAT899I,not awful. but not good either.,1482278400,,31,4.333333333333333
8631408,4,B00HAT899I,Good short witchy huberus! Kind of deals the Puritan witch hunting lesson without any twists and turns. Not great acting but fair and the screen play was not bad. There was no waste on scenery and irrelevant character introduction.,1478822400,,231,4.948717948717949

8631412,5,B00HAT899I,Well done!,1474329600,,10,4.5
8631413,4,B00HAT899I,"It is a cool little horror tale of a witch and the witchfinder that finds her and ""tries"" her.
The acting is, well, not great, but it is not terrible either.  There is a good story here and some nice little scary bits too.  The story is interesting and frankly, it's short duration is perfect.

There were a couple of times that I thought some lines or dialogue seemed a little more modern than the setting and there were some other issues, but nothing that detracted from an enjoyable little flick.

I rather enjoyed it to be honest.",1473897600,,534,4.418367346938775
