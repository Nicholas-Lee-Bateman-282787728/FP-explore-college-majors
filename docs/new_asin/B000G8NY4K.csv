2603843,5,B000G8NY4K,"Having seen the show many times this year it is nice having it to watch whenever I want. No one can sing like Engelbert does. He'll take any song and put himself into it like he does Cry and My Way and no one can touch his version. From the valley to the top of a mountain is where he takes me. I agree with a couple other people who rated the DVD, the sound was not top notch. I would advise everyone to get all his live cds and DVDs. Billie Fortin, Ca.",1162166400,,454,3.8404255319148937
2603844,5,B000G8NY4K,"Engelbert's new dvd is wonderful. His voice and talent on stage is Totally Amazing. There is a special feature song ""Columns Of Grey"" about the fallen soldiers, it brings you to tears. To top it off there is an interview. Definately worth buying.",1160092800,2,246,4.744186046511628
2603845,5,B000G8NY4K,"This CD is TOTALLY AMAZING.  When I listen to it I feel like I'm in the audience.  I LOVE IT WHEN HE DOES LIVE CD'S. I LOVE HIM, PERIOD!!!

YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.",1160092800,2,173,3.8857142857142857
2603846,5,B000G8NY4K,"Oh how I enjoyed this dvd of engelbert live. From start to finish engelbert is just sensational. Every song he sings is sung so beautifully. I have heard several people sing 'My Way' but engelbert beats all the other's. The emotion he put's into this song is incredible. Every song on this disc is a winner and I even joined in singing along with his old favourites. Engelbert is awesome and as the concert title is totally amazing, this sums englebert. Great show.",1159833600,11,465,4.614457831325301
2603847,5,B000G8NY4K,"I am so in awe of this performer and his clarity and heart in his music.  Totally Amazing provided new songs that were so enjoyable (although his classics are great).  I loved ""a Chance To Be A Hero"", ""There's No Good In Goodby"", ""Cry"" and ""Totally Amazing"".  My only complaint would be that the orchestra seemed to drown Engelbert and his singers out, and he can still perform to pefection without any back-up!  If you liked this DVD, you'll love ""Engelbert Live at the London Palladium"", where his comedy and his ""dance ability"" is evident along with his vocals.  When you listen to the bonus interviews,  it's hard to believe all this man has accomplished and how he continues to tour with fans waiting for him to appear in so many countries.  This a Totally, Totally Amazing Performer!",1158969600,6,789,4.673913043478261
2603848,5,B000G8NY4K,"I second the Wow, Wow, and Wow again of the previous review as I received my DVD today. I give this DVD a 5 stars plus. I got the CD two days ago and have been enjoying it tremendously, but that was just the beginning as the DVD is absolutely incredible. What a fantastic concert recording. Engelbert's voice has certainly improved with age and how wonderful to have the pleasure of enjoying his singing for he is ""Totally Amazing"".",1158192000,2,432,4.481012658227848
2603849,5,B000G8NY4K,"WOW..WOW..AND WOW AGAIN!!! A MUST FOR ENGELBERT FANS.SOUND AND IMAGES ARE EXCELLANT. ENGELBERT IS A TRUE PERFORMER AND THIS DVD PROVES THAT HE IS AS STRONG AS EVER.WISH THERE WERE MORE LIKE HIM, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ,THERE CAN ONLY BE 0NE ""ENGE""",1158192000,,246,4.613636363636363
2603850,5,B000G8NY4K,"There are somethings that happen during the day that make your day special.  Watching Engelbert Humperdinck perform on his new DVD ""Totally Amazing"" is one of those things.  His new DVD ""Totally Amazing"" proves that true quality only continues to improve with age. Every song on his new DVD is special. He just keeps getting better and better. ""Totally Amazing"" is totally enjoyable.

2603873,5,B000G8NY4K,"Oops, I think I gave the wrong review on the last album.  This album is as the title suggests, Totally Amazing. It is one of his very best and one of my favorites, and I think I have every one of his albums.  Columns of Gray just sends chills up your spine. Everyone who has the least patriotism is them should listen to this song. It truly says it all about war.",1373155200,,363,4.027777777777778
2603874,3,B000G8NY4K,"It's a decent DVD, although I was a bit disspointed that plenty of his songs/performances are from later in his career. I prefer watching and hearing his original recordings/performances that show him in his prime. I would recommend an alternate DVD: Engelbert Humperdinck: 1967-1977.",1360022400,,284,5.4772727272727275
2603875,5,B000G8NY4K,Product arrived in a time manner.  It was without scratches and I have enjoyed very much.  This CD was the only recording of My Way that Engelbert ever recorded for distribution. Thank You,1332979200,,188,4.666666666666667
2603876,5,B000G8NY4K,"Saw this show at the Orleans in Las Vegas 2005.  Enge still has the voice.  A great show and performance.  My favorite Enge DVD.  The 1967 to 1979 is great, original lip synch of hits.  The DVD with full orchestra is good.  But, this Enge is my favorite, with a little combo and 2 background singers.  My favorite songs: A Chance to be a Hero, and Somebody to Love.  Check them out. One slow and moving ballad, the other a fun rocker.  Thanks Enge for your wonderful performances, they move me.",1320883200,,494,4.34065934065934
2603877,5,B000G8NY4K,"I first saw Engelbert in person 40 years ago; and I remember it like it was yesterday.  I have six of his DVDs and I love them all.  This one is special because of the way he performs ""My Way"" and ""Cry"" as well as the interview.  His voice may not be as powerful as it was 40 years ago, but he's still one of my two alltime favorite performers (Elvis is the other).  Anyone who is a fan, will want this dvd.",1296345600,,407,3.8674698795180724
2603878,5,B000G8NY4K,"My Way by EH is the best version of that song. That is my favorite song. I am not an EH's fan, but when I discovered EH's My Way in that concert, I became in loved with it.",1282348800,,172,3.5526315789473686
2603879,3,B000G8NY4K,I was disappointed in this DVD. The band didn't seem connected to Engelbert and it wasn't as passionate as his other DVDs. I did like the songs and his connection to the audience but the band wasn't personal.,1263081600,,208,4.5
2603880,5,B000G8NY4K,"I recently saw this concert on a streaming service and let me say i was totaly blown away with Engelbert's suave voice and amazing vocal range (remember, he is 70 years old here!). The song lineup is great, new and old with an emphasis on the balads of course. The band is top notch, he is in full command of the audience and they love every minute of it. If you are just a passing fan or a die hard groupie, this concert will astound you and become a fav for a long time to come. Engelbert, you're still #1 in my book!",1262304000,,519,4.048543689320389
2603891,4,B000G8NY4K,"at last a dvd worthwhile buying and listening to from engelbert. good dts audio and an appropriate title that fits in with the songs selection. engelbert has not lost any of his stage personality and performance - in fact it appears to get better and more matured with him age-ing. if you have any cd's or dvd's from engelbert already, then it is worhwhile adding this dvd to your colletion. thx. andr",1257638400,,401,4.583333333333333
2603892,4,B000G8NY4K,"I have just turned fifty and i am discovering a new appreciation for great talent since it's so hard to find these days. In my ""rockin"" years it was mostly because of the music but now i am learning to enjoy great vocalists. Elvis was the greatest entertainer to ever live and now i am discovering a hidden treasured talent in Engelbert. He has a powerful and smooth voice and i now know why he was so loved. This DVD catches him in his later career but his voice is still strong and his love of performing is still obvious. The best Engelbert DVD is the one titled Engelbert Live, the one that was conducted by Babe Salvetti and he begins the show with Love is a many Spledored Thing (better than anyone ever has ever sang it). My favorite cut on this DVD was Cry and Love me with all your Heart and do not miss the moving Columns of Gray on the bonus track.
Any Engelebert recording CD or DVD is worth the money because when it comes to pure great vocals he and Tom Jones, Tony Bennett and Elvis cannot be outdone.",1234310400,2,1016,4.2153846153846155
2603893,5,B000G8NY4K,An excellent concert.  I have all his concert DVD's and this is by far the best.  The older he gets the better he sounds.  An unbelievable voice for a man in his 70's.  Hope he never retires.,1188086400,,191,4.081081081081081
2603894,5,B000G8NY4K,I really enjoyed this concert DVD.  So many familiar songs & Engelbert still looks AMAZING!  Solid vocals & great entertainment.,1185580800,,128,5.35
2603895,5,B000G8NY4K,Being fans of ENGELBERT my wife & I enjoyed this movie almost as much as the  Totally Amazing live concert we went to. It's a great addition to our collection of CDs & DVDs that all romantics and music lovers would be sure to enjoy. As much as we enjoy live concerts it's terrific to be able to invite ENGELBERT into our lounge room to recap on anything we missed or want to see again.,1179964800,,385,4.133333333333334
2603896,5,B000G8NY4K,"The performance may not be his best, but even so it's a very good show, the version of the song ""My Way"" has been a little over rated in the other coments.

Finally a very good live performer, the albun ""the 16 most requested songs"" its a must.

Get the concert where he sings ""Still"".",1177545600,,285,4.163636363636364
2603897,4,B000G8NY4K,"This DVD is great. Enge's voice is still smoking. But the songs selection are not the best. If you have to choose between Totally Amazing and Engelbert Live, I'd recommend the latter, although the image is not as crisp as Totally Amazing as it was recorded in 1995. But the sound quality is there. Guaranteed you'll enjoy Engelbert Live if you are a fan.",1176940800,2,354,4.546875
2603898,5,B000G8NY4K,"Engelbert's new Totally Amazing DVD was just that. We really enjoy this DVD. He sings such amazing songs and sounds so great. We are happy to have made this purchase. Thank You for the recommendation by other buyers.

2603899,5,B000G8NY4K,Overall I thought the performance on this DVD is superb and is highly recommended. The performance on some old standards like Cry and My Way were worth the price of the DVD alone. I do think that Engelbert is a Great Entertainer but would have liked to hear more of his hits but due to the length of the show I guess this would not be possible. If you are a fan then this is a must have item as he still sounds good and will be something you can look back on for years to come.,1170288000,4,477,3.9278350515463916

2603912,5,B000G8NY4K,"I saw Engelbert's show on April 3, 2006 in Green Bay, Wi. It was ""Amazing."" It was so good, that I was saddened that after all of these years this is the first time I got to be at one of his concerts. I have both the CD and the DVD, and they are so much like the show. Beautiful music and a beautiful voice! I just hope Engelbert keeps touring so we can keep enjoying his shows - an appreciation of the finer things in life. I recommend the CD and DVD to anyone, in fact all of his DVD's are a treasure and a must-have.",1168300800,2,519,3.8598130841121496

2603914,5,B000G8NY4K,"THIS DVD OF ENGELBERT IS ""TOTALLY AMAZING"".  HE STILL LOOKS GREAT AND HIS VOICE IS LIKE NO OTHER!!!

2603916,4,B000G8NY4K,"Engelbert is absolutely one of the finest talents to pass through in this lifetime, and this most recent musical offering from him doesn't disappoint. What would you like something upbeat, some fun country like songs or a heart wrenching love song? It's all here, and ""Columns Of Gray"" which at first I thought was out of character for Enge, was I wrong he nails it. What a voice.",1167091200,2,380,4.602941176470588
2603917,5,B000G8NY4K,"There are about four other Engelbert concert DVD's available out there to purchase.  This is his latest release.  The picture and sound quality of this product is the best of them all...and I know, because I own all of them!

He is 71 now, and looking tired and often worn out.  He did not sing the old hits very well during this taping, however, he closed the show with an incredible version of ""My Way"".  Long overdue, he brought back his ultimate power to finish off a difficult song as only Humperdinck can....it brought back memories of his old concerts back in the late '70's, when he was powerful and truly gave every show ""his all""....lately, he has been on ""cruise control""....

Finally, he gets five stars from me on this DVD for singing old obscure songs from his old LP's...such as ""The Last of the Romantics"" and ""Love Me With All of Your Heart"".

If you are a Humperdinck fan...this is a must purchase!",1163376000,20,916,4.515151515151516
2603918,5,B000G8NY4K,"For those Enge fans out there, this is a must. For those of you who aren't as of yet,this will definitely make you a fan! This is one of his all time best.",1163116800,,155,3.727272727272727
2603919,5,B000G8NY4K,"The title of the DVD is also an apt description of the performer, Engelbert Humperdinck, who will be celebrating his 40th year in show business in January 2007.

  If you are a fan who has seen Enge in concert over 200 times or someone who hasn't been fortunate enough to see his show, you'll love this one.

From his first hit, ""Release Me,"" which was a worldwide hit to a brand new song, ""Columns of Gray"" the songs are fabulous.  Dedicated to all the soldiers in wars, ""Columns of Gray"" is very touching and should be the theme song of Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and so many others honoring our veterans and those that gave their lives for our country.

  You may not believe your ears when he sings ""Honky Tonk World"" if you think he is just a singer of ballads.  This man can and does sing all kinds of songs from the sublime to the ridiculous.

  His rendition of ""My Way"" always brings audiences to their feet, cheering for encores.

  A big plus is one of the best interviews Engelbert has ever given, and he lets his fans know just how much he appreciates them.

  Drop a few hints, and you may receive this DVD for Christmas, your birthday or some other special occasion.  If not, do yourself a favor and buy it for yourself.  You won't regret it.

  The men will love it also, especially my husband.",1163030400,5,1311,4.370833333333334
2603920,5,B000G8NY4K,"Still yet another great performance and a wonderful selection of songs. Totally amazing is just that!  He never ceases to amaze me with his ability to reach those high notes yet and hold them for so long.  Enge is still the greatest and best there is no matter what show you see.

I am seeing him next week in Atlantic City and expect to be wowed in the 2nd row at the Tropicana!  Yippppppppiiiiiiiieeeeee!
