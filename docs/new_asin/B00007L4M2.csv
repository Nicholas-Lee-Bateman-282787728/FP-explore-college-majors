7977885,2,B00007L4M2,This movie is a mixture of two different films and neither of them is any good.  Klimovsky edited his 1970`s film El Hombre que Vino del Odio and merged it with a new film directed by Al Adamson which is filled with violence and nudity but not enough length to rate it as a feature film.  So both directors try to seel us these separate stories as a brand new one but the lack of continuity makes evident this is not an original release. Mean Mother`s only attraction is the presence of Luciana Paluzzi who saves this boring picture in the few scenes she appears.,986515200,6,563,4.352380952380952
