Many people seem put off that Grace Kelly didn't shine in it, but it's clearly Granger's movie.  Paul Douglas does a good job of playing himself.  The scenery was great and the story was realistic. I liked it.",1258588800,,367,4.6
584989,3,6303120512,"Probably this is one of those films that would never be considered as a masterwork. But it is one of those films you always watch. Because it is pure entertaning. You have exotic locations, a hero, a heroine, the villian...

Again another technicolor adventure this time in Colombia. The perfect excuse to create a ""typical"" hacienda in the Hollywood way but with the usual good taste of that genious who was Ceddric Gibbons and see Miss Kelly wearing those outfits by Helen Rose

The great star here is, evidently Stewart Granger, playing a not , particularly nice hero. Let's face it if someone can play a hero who is not perfect is he. The problem is that Miss Kelly seems lost in the film. I mean, she is beautiful as always but her manners are sometimes annoying. She lacks the energy that Deborah Kerr would have given to the character.

This is another example of craftsmanship of studios in the 50's. It is a film for pure enjoyment.",1100736000,19,941,4.589285714285714
584990,1,6303120512,"I have seen all of Grace Kelly's movies, and this one stands out as by far the least appealing.
Grace's talents are wasted in the silly movie. Grace plays a lonely coffee plantation owner who meets Stewart Granger, a thoroughly awful cad, and we are supposed to believe that the two fall in love, even though there is zero chemistry between them.
Ms Kelly herself has stated publically her great dislike of this film, and I for one agree with her.",1036281600,12,447,4.530864197530864

Unfortunately this film is unkown in Germany. doesnt even exist a German version of the film.  the story is - well, not a gold nugget or an emerald - but good for entertainment.

585089,5,6303120512,"An excellent adventure movie. The war was over and America was experiencing an incredible boom in wealth. More and more movies were being shot in color as opposed to most being shot in black and white during the 30's & 40's. The young adults at the time,men who had fought the war and women who worked in the war factories were flooding to the movies. Movies like ""Green Fire"" were great entertainment then as much as now. This is a movie that I highly recommend to every single movie fan. For us, there is no such thing as an old movie. ""Green Fire"" is a fine adventure",1422748800,,570,4.336448598130841

I was expecting a forceful story along those lines. I got the impression that Stewart Grangers heart was not in it for this film. Grace Kelly is there because the story revolves around the two characters. Grace Kelly should not have been cast in the role, she does not bring any fire green or otherwise to the movie.

585139,4,6303120512,Another great classic film this time starring Stewart Granger and Grace Kelly.  Stewart Granger's character was a greedy emerald miner who clashed with Grace Kelly's character who ran a coffee plantation which would be ruined if the mining was not stopped.  Really good developement of the main characters and not bad chemistry between them either.  Plenty of action and a very enjoyable movie.,1358640000,,394,5.222222222222222
585140,4,6303120512,"Made for Cinemascope, the film loses much on television. I am judging only by what I saw by watching a DVD not by what I saw on a movie screen in the mid-1950's.
The major pleasure is seeing three important figures of the late 40's and 50's all of whom are gone now. Grace Kelly looks lovely, fragile, untouchable by human hands, and very, very young. You could never tell from what she was given to do, that she would end her brief career considered by many to be not only a good looker but a coming actress as well. Never mind debating that point: I simply enjoyed looking at her although hearing her was less pleasurable....blame the screenwriters and the Director. Paul Douglas who was Big at that time, having come off sports and other radio announcing chores into major movies, is given nothing much to do but be the Stars best friend and partner. This is not a film for which he could have thought he would be remembered. The Star, clearly, was Steward Granger, whose career gave him the chance to do very good things, particularly playing the African Hunter/Guide. Here he makes the best that can be made of a routine script.
I  enjoyed watching the film, mostly for nostalgic reasons, being about the same age as young Grace, and knowing about her later Royalty and sadly premature death.  Douglas and Granger also reverberate in my memory.  I imagine much the same reactions will move older viewers. Just what those in Grace Kelly's age cohort at the time she made the film, in her early twenties, will think, I cannot guess.",1356998400,,1535,4.574545454545454
585161,4,6303120512,"Love Stuart Granger.  i don't believe he ever made a bad movie. Grace Kelley wasx unusaully strong in this, she is quite good. Interesting story line as well.  Enjoyed it",1356652800,,170,4.633333333333334
585162,3,6303120512,"This isn't a great movie, but it's not a bad one either.  Stewart Granger plays a globe-trotting adventurer currently obsessed with mining for emeralds (the green fire of the title) in Columbia.  Grace Kelly is the owner of a coffee plantation obsessed with saving the business founded by her grandfather. Paul Douglas is the honorable guy who tries to make things come out right.  None of these fine actors are in their best form.  This might have something to do with the slim plot.

We are asked to believe that, while the current cash-on-hand of the plantation is $10,000, Miss Kelly can afford to wear a different designer dress in every scene.  We are also asked to believe that she wears crinolines in a hot climate.  (Some women will do anything for fashion.)  But most incredibly we are asked to believe that she will forgive Stewart Granger, who has been a cad through the entire film, because he did one heroic deed and will pass up the honorable Paul Douglas to end up in Granger's arms.

What amazes me is that MGM sent a film crew to Columbia for location shooting in CinemaScope and Eastman Color with a fine cast but couldn't come up with a better screenplay.  It's entertainment, but you can do much better.",1353196800,2,1224,4.625
585163,4,6303120512,"I enjoyed this movie, as a piece of light entertainment. Is it high drama? No, it isn't. But Grace Kelly is beautiful, and Stewart Granger is handsome, and the story line has enough twists that it takes you in, and you're not sure how it is going to turn out. And the CinemaScope presentation of South America is a pleasure to watch. For 1954, this is a good film. I purchased this movie, and would do so again.",1341014400,,411,4.282051282051282

Grace Kelly is embarrassingly miscast in a role that cries out for Deborah Kerr or Jean Simmons, and Stewart Granger is a dick. +1 point for action sequences well-staged by Marton, who would go on to be 2nd unit director in charge of the chariot scenes in BEN-HUR.

585167,3,6303120512,"EXCEPT FOR THE stalwart presence of Stewart Granger, the etherial and luminous presence of Grace Kelly, and the everyman-still-can-be-romantic presence of Paul Douglas, this movie, ""Green Fire"", is a typical adventure-film of the 1950s.  There are some exciting moments -- such as a raging, rising river, a mine cave-in, Mr. Granger's meeting, early on, with a hungry tiger, and some bandits -- but, except for fans of the above three stars, (and several more obscure actors, such as John Ericson, Robert Tafur, Carlita, Murvyn Vye, Jose Torvay, etc.), and perhaps fans of adventure films, this movie sadly has very little to offer.

Yes, there IS a rousing score, (by Miklos Rozsa, and which -- unlike other Rosza scores I have heard, does NOT, (mostly) contain the same Rosza melodies which are also used in other films....although if one listens closely, a tiny bit of the music accompanying 'Ben Hur's' march to the gallies can be heard at climactic moments).  And yes, there IS some very clever dialogue / repartee, especially between Mr. Granger and Mr. Douglas, which is delivered in a very nice, natural manner.  Unfortunately, there is also -- in this film from 1954 -- a bit of stereotyping, especially of the Columbian workmen, who are seen employed first on Catherine Knowland's (Grace Kelly's), and her brother Donald's (John Ericson's), plantation, then -- willy-nilly, without even a contract dispute -- are sent, en masse, to work in Rian X. Mitchell's (Stewart Granger's), and Vic Leonard's (Paul Douglas's), emerald mine.  There ARE two brief camera-moments of Ms. Kelly raking through coffee beans, and Mr. Douglas placing a basket of these beans in a cleansing-bath, right alongside their respective female and male Native Columbian employees....but I waited in vain for a scene wherein just ONE of these hired workers would distinguish him or herself from the huge mass of these extras, by, perhaps, being caught reading a book or even looking at the pictures of a book, and so display some spark of individuality and intellectual intelligence.  Perhaps I was watching the wrong movie -- maybe I should have been seeing ""The Corn Is Green"", with Bette Davis, instead -- but the ""en masse"" acting by most of the Native Columbian extras, (except for once in a while, like when one of the men says to Mr. Granger: ""Patron!  I have found an emerald!  Come, please to see!""), did upset my 21st century sensibilities.  (And probably upset Ms. Kelly as well.  I have read that, later on, as Princess Grace, when a TV documentary was being made about her life in the palace, a director was upset to see White and Black children playing in the palace gardens together.  ""Please remove them for this filming, your highness,"" the film-maker said to Princess Grace. ""They wouldn't like to see that in the Southern U.S."", he tried to explain to the princess.  ""Oh, but we do!"" was her reply.
(Ms. Kelly had, years before, simply walked OUT of a famous New York Nightclub, when they would not admit Black entertainer Josephine Baker.)  But the script for this film, 'Green Fire', was the script for this film, 'Green Fire', and it includes this rather
sad, stereotyped view of the Columbian ""Native Indian"" workmen and workwomen.  So -- be warned....

One line in the film has Grace Kelly saying that she could, perhaps, ""Wait for her Prince Charming"" to ride up!  This being 1954, one wonders if she had already met Prince Rainier?  Or perhaps just her own, truly regal presence, (even before she officially became a Princess), inspired this interesting co-incidence of dialogue and future reality to be written into the script?

The action sequences ARE exciting.  Doubly so when one realizes that 1954 was LONG before computer animation, and that all the dangerous segments had to be done live(!)  (In one book -- Movie Icons: Grace Kelly, published by Taschen -- a comment by Grace Kelly is given, an insider's view of the production, which included a portion of the production crew getting lost and almost drowning during the making of this adventure saga!)  Without computers, the actors -- and their stunt-doubles, and other stunt-people -- had to be very brave to make adventure-films of any sort!

Despite these somewhat exciting scenes, the occasional clever dialogue, the majesty of the Columbian wilderness, and the obvious effort of everyone involved with this production, the story is similar to many other adventure sagas.

Thus, again -- except for fans of the stars of rhis film, and/or fans of adventure films, in general -- this is a typical A- film from Hollywood.  (Being an ardent Grace Kelly fan, I AM glad I saw this movie.  But, unlike most of her other films -- one time is enough to sit through 'Green Fire' -- even for me.",1289606400,,4757,4.91625
585168,5,6303120512,"When I ordered this DVD I was expecting a fine performance by Grace Kelly in a relatively weak film. So when I pushed play I was ready for a bomb with a sweet touch of Grace and suddenly I found myself enjoying everything about it. All the actors were good, the story was simple but engaging, and the action sequences by 1954 standards were spectacular. After The End popped up on the screen I found myself rather satisfied with this hard-to-find pricey purchase. If you're a fan of Grace Kelly or King Solomon's Mines, you will enjoy this. Hurry and order before it goes out of print! You know it will in a couple of years at most... Then you'll have to pay twice as much for it used.",1287100800,2,685,4.317829457364341
585169,5,6303120512,"IN 1954 MGM sent their cameras to Colombia,South America,for this very pleasant adventure movie. Although not a masterpiece, the beautiful locations helped a rather mild story about emerald fever. Stewart GRANGER and Paul DOUGLAS are quite convincing as the mining buddies, but Grace KELLY seems bored and not interested by her role through most of the film, wearing gloves in a coffee plantation(in Colombia, with an average temperature of 110in the shade !!!) and changing dresses (created by Helen ROSE, of course !)in pratically every scene !!! Well that was part of Hollywood Magic, I guess...The DVD from WB Archive Collection is in very good shape, in Widescreen, Stereo sound and color by Eastmancolor.

7839836,3,6303120512,"Green Fire was one of several films I saw as a kid in the 50s that every studio seemed to churn out because the formula was an easy sell. I like to call them Khaki Operas....relatively low budget affairs designed to lure audiences enamored with quests for buried riches mixed with a generous helping of lusty romance. Green Fire fits that template and is very similar to other efforts released the same year, such as Secret of the Incas, Valley of the Kings and one that came out the following year, Foxfire. In each film, the delicate leading lady seems repulsed by an unshaven hero clad in sweaty khaki. Of course, she will eventually succumb to his reckless charm. It's the same recipe that was later so skillfully reworked for the Indiana Jones series.

Green Fire does not represent the best of this genre, with its thin story line and threadbare production. I'm guessing it was quickly put together to promote the wide screen Cinemascope process introduced only a year before( note the prominence of the CS logo on the film's poster). Leading lady Grace Kelly emotes amidst the palm fronds, resisting a heartless Stewart Granger who surely must have wanted better roles. Aiding in the misadventure is sidekick Paul Douglas, a leading man stuck in a character actor's body. Green Fire is not the best of the lot but you might find it interesting to see Ms Kelly just before she became a real life princess.

We rented the HD version via Amazon Video. On the plus side, the image looked great and rental price was just right.",1461110400,,1529,4.680297397769516
