8640731,5,B00IBQZUL4,"I just finished watching Chip On my Shoulder: The Cautionary Tale of Slapshot and it was incredible. The film is jam packed with tons of archival footage, features compelling and insightful interviews with key band members/crew from various eras and is narrated eloquently and professionally by Dave Smalley.

Congratulations to all involved. This documentary was well worth the wait and far exceeded all expectations.",1397174400,7,418,5.53125
