4189010,5,B003SPDS8U,"This is most enjoyable if you watch the previous box sets, full metal panic and full metal panic TSR raids.  They lay out the foundation for the humor in FUMOFFU.  If you like the previous box sets, you will enjoy this.  Animation is good as the others and humor is mixed with the classroom atmosphere.",1291075200,,302,4.454545454545454
4189011,3,B003SPDS8U,Great series - funny spin off. The only disappointing thing about this set is that it's not available in WideScreen. So it doesn't look to good on my HDTV. Even with the zoom feature. Funimation is notorious for just copy and pasting old DVDs onto Blu-Ray and reselling them as Hi-Def. Purchase if you're a fan - skip otherwise. Especially at the price now.,1289174400,2,357,4.59375
4189012,5,B003SPDS8U,"Full Metal Panic Fumoffu is a standalone comedy series created by Kyoto Animation. It does not follow any established manga plotline or pre set materials. It was created more as a love letter to the fans of Full Metal Panic who loved the absurd situations Sousuke got into when trying to protect Kaname Chidori, and at his time at Jindai High School.

The enjoyment of this series comes when you know Sousuke and the characters involved in Full Metal Panic, watching this without seeing the other 2 shows in my opinion is pointless as you may just find it a little. Well silly, you won't appreciate it if you watch this first.

Moving on.

Mostly based at Jindai High School these are short storys that show various random situations that Sousuke gets into when trying to keep Kaname safe from harm. The humor here comes from Sousukes tendency to over react and see everything as a threat.

With this Sousuke clashes with the more spirited characters in the show. From a crazy teacher to a Karate club to a crazy old man who Sousuke unknownly did something horrible too.

Being put into weird yet funny situations like coaching Rugby to fighting Yakuza in a giant Bonta Kun outfit, Sousuke never fails to amuse.

The normal life is a relative unknown to Sousuke. All he has ever known is war, conflict, things like that when he served as a guerilla soldier as a kid, and when joining Mithril and the TDD.

This in my eyes is where the series excels. Sousuke can be completely clueless, everyone around him and in his classes knows this, but he's learning. He's a good guy with a good heart.

Amazing Series. There's something to love in every episode.",1287273600,15,1651,4.610921501706485
4189013,4,B003SPDS8U,"I'm writing this review having seen the series, but before the dvd set is available so for information about the specific quality of this distribution see later review.  As to the series though, this show is hilarious.  I'm not a big anime fan and I couldn't stand the main Full Metal Panic series (just the same old mellow drama cliche anime crap) but this series is something special.  It has that dark ironic humor that... well let me explain the premise:

A teenage boy mercenary (Sousuke) is attending a high school because he has been assigned to protect a girl (Kaname) who is a target for a criminal organization.  He's basically a special ops guy now acting as a (somewhat) undercover bodyguard.  He then proceeds to take normal every day scenarios (that he's unfamiliar with) and interpret them in the most paranoid para-military fashion.  Think misinterpreting a car back firing for sniper fire kind of stuff (I don't want to give away any of the show's jokes).  Again, I'm not a big anime person, but this is one show that can be enjoyed by non-anime fans (partially because we can identify with Sousuke when a reference to Japanese culture goes completely over our heads).  You don't need to get the main Full Metal Panic! series to appreciate this side series (in fact I recommend avoiding it).",1285286400,2,1308,4.752212389380531
4189014,5,B003SPDS8U,"This is one of the best anime series that I have seen in a few years.... But this one 1.5 of the full metal panic series is one of the funniest, most action packed, and fun series I have ever seen.

4189026,5,B003SPDS8U,"This was before the transition into animated shows being in HD, but FUNimation did a good job doing their best to update the show to HD standards.  It still has black bars on the side since it isn't full HD, but still has a good amount of crispness to the images.  The only weird thing sometimes is the bloom of the animation can be a bit bright on some scenes (not a big deal by any means).
This mini-series is by far the most fun, taking itself as un-seriously as it can and making each episode/half-episode as fun and entertaining as possible.",1426982400,,546,4.3431372549019605

4189047,5,B003SPDS8U,"Before I get into my review for those of you who don't know this is a spinoff that takes place between season one and season two of the Full Metal Panic series. So it goes without saying that you need to watch season one before watching Full Metal Panic Fumoffu. While season one is a perfect combination of comedy, drama and action the spinoff is a straightforward comedy.

The show follows the misadventures of a socially inept soldier as he attempts to pose as a student in order to protect a high school student. There is no overarching narrative to Fumoffu nor does it advance the Full Metal Panic series' story instead it focuses on the comical hijinks of Sousuke as he protects Kaname.

The animation is top notch, the characters are entertaining, the episodic stories are hilarious with an excellent English dub making this a must own for Full Metal Panic fans!",1397606400,,869,4.673202614379085
4189048,5,B003SPDS8U,"The Full Metal Panic series like any other anime uses futuristic technology and backstory coupled with a rainbow of various personalities behind them. As a military fan myself the theme that the main character Souske gave off from day 1 was a joke in of itself while the series remained serious for the most part. But after the first season when this came along, it was too much. All of the personalities were used to the fullest potential and the humor was better than even anime based solely on comedy. I highly recommend it to anyone who is familiar with the series and wants a nice breather before getting into the Second Raid.",1390348800,,631,4.592920353982301
4189049,5,B003SPDS8U,This show is amazing. The Fumoffu season is more focused on the day to day high school life of Sousuke and Kaname and takes a break from the intense intrigue of the first and final seasons of FMP. I love the light tone and hilarious shenanigans that the FMP characters get into in this season.,1381190400,,293,4.345454545454546

4189086,5,B003SPDS8U,"Fumoffu is kind of a spinoff/side story of the main Full Metal Panic series, but it's much less serious. It focuses instead on the wacky antics of each character, especially Sagara's complete lack of understanding of normal culture.",1358640000,,232,5.131578947368421
4189087,5,B003SPDS8U,If you can stop laughing long enough to read a review your do alright with this anime. Don't say I didn't warn you enough to go to the bathroom before you watch. Laughter and mahem abound in the 2nd season.,1357516800,,206,4.175
4189088,5,B003SPDS8U,"This is a cool little off shoot from the full metal panic series. It takes some of the more serious aspects of the series, and brings out comedy.

4189089,5,B003SPDS8U,"For those of you that like FMP, you'll love Fumoffu. It is pretty much just a high school love comedy. It's FMP minus the mecha and evil dudes. It's pretty over the top, but way fun. The animation is just as good if not a bit better, and the soundtrack is also great. In Fumoffu there are also some new and colorful characters introduced. We also get the pleasure of seeing new sides to some of the old ones. I simply love FMP Fumoffu and I hope you do too.",1350172800,,457,4.088888888888889
4189090,5,B003SPDS8U,"One of the greatest animation that I have watched. Really funny.

By the way, I watched it several years ago.",1341964800,,109,4.45
4189091,5,B003SPDS8U,"Full Metal Panic is one of my favorite animes of all time and this season is definitely a must have. I watched this with a friend and it was incredibly funny from start to finish. This season basically takes a vacation from the main plot, but as long as you've either watched season 1 or both 1 and the 2nd raid you won't be confused. The overall seriousness of the anime has been blocked for this season and the comedy has been released.",1326844800,,438,4.289156626506024
4189092,4,B003SPDS8U,"This is a pretty light-hearted series, based (like oh-so-many Anime) at a high-school.  Only several of the students are really Mercenaries, and one in particular takes his bodyguard role way too seriously. Those are the best moments in the series - his over-reaction to everyday occurrences. It's like putting Conan the Barbarian in charge of Medieval times and telling him to make it real. Way over the top and hilarious. You feel so sorry for Sousuke - but want to see him fail so badly.

If you're a FMP fan, I'd watch this series (FUMOFFU - that's a mouth-full) - like light hearted adventure? Ditto. Looking for the all-out blast-fest that is FMP? Nope! This is a fun, family romp.",1313712000,,687,4.716666666666667
4189093,5,B003SPDS8U,"The product was delivered in a timely manner, was exactly as described and made for a satisfying transaction.

The DVD set was brand new and in original packaging. The price was right and the shipping cost and time was also a solid feature.

The series was quite enjoyable for fans of the original Full Metal Panic. They designed this twelve episode series in a way that compliments the characters while not going over the top or stretching too much. This is a mech-romantic comedy that you are sure to enjoy.",1313020800,,509,4.644444444444445
4189104,5,B003SPDS8U,"This is just as good as the other Full Metal Panics. The only difference is, in FUMOFFU, there's no AS (Arms Slave) usage. It just follows the average life of Kaname and Souske. But it's still the same amount of awesomeness and hilarity. I abolutely LOVE when Kaname beats the hell out of Souske! The last episode is when the hilarity goes into overdrive and there's a little surprise at the end for all you ecchi lovers ;D",1308182400,,423,4.435897435897436
4189105,5,B003SPDS8U,"This is a more comedic version of FMP! a bit silly at times, but still worth the purchase, especially if your already a FMP! fan. good price :)",1305331200,,143,4.142857142857143
4189106,5,B003SPDS8U,"I watched this after first watching the first season followed by the second season. I actually wasn't too interested in watching this. I bought it and it sat on my shelf for about 3 months before I decided to watch this. Full Metal Panic is a series I enjoyed but the first and second season's didn't do enough to make me say this series was one of my all time favorites. I bought Fumoffu simply out of being a completionist. After the first episode though I was hooked!

The whole romance and comedy premise wasn't interesting to me because I felt the characters were a bit flat in the first and second raid and without interesting characters, romance and comedy just don't work. Without being distracted by war conflicts and action sequences, the creators were able to make the characters much more interesting and it really caught me by surprise. I really fell in love with the characters in Fumoffu and my only disappointment is that it ended.

In the end, I feel Fumoffu is the best that Full Metal Panic has to offer and I highly recommend it.

I think you do have to watch the first season in order to appreciate and understand the relationship between the two main characters. If you've seen the first raid and you were disappointed... fret not... Fumoffu can really deliver.",1304121600,,1283,4.618421052631579
4189107,5,B003SPDS8U,"...to watch FMP: FUMOFFU! I've enjoyed the original series and FUMOFFU. 2nd raid was a bit dark for my preference but if that's where the series is headed, so be it. I wish it luck...Based upon what I've seen, looks like 2nd raid will be the end for the time being.",1301961600,,265,4.215686274509804
4189108,5,B003SPDS8U,"This series which takes place between Full Metal Panic! and Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid is a comic relief of sorts. It takes much of the humor found in the first season and expands on it. Also important to note is that you don't have to be familiar with the Full Metal Panic! story line to understand and follow this series, this can standalone. The packaging is fine for the complete set, comes with two dvds, some trailers, opening and closing songs. But not much in the way of extras which is not surprising because the other two series has more extras. So for fans of the humor in the first season then this is a must-buy and if you only enjoyed the mech battles and plot of the series then skip this and Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid will complete the story Mithril, Sousuke, and Kaname.",1297728000,,802,4.389261744966443
4189109,5,B003SPDS8U,"The Bottom Line: So good, so funny, and action is much better and of much better quality.  I'm not into mecha, and as there is no mecha in this series, I enjoyed this anime thoroughly.  This is, in all seriousness, the funniest anime I've ever watched.  Buy it. No questions. Don't wonder ""well this reviewer likes it.... will I? My sense of humor is probably better and more mature than his...""  It's not. Great, great anime, completely worth the money.  Please Note: Buying the prequel series ""Full Metal Panic!"" will increase your enjoyment of ""FMP? Fumoffu.""",1297555200,,562,4.8125
4189110,4,B003SPDS8U,"This is a departure from the first Full Metal Panic. No robots, no missions, just pure comedy and drama and a whole lot of angst between Sousuke and Kaname! Which I like. I love these lead characters but of course we cannot deny the fact that there may be fans of Sousuke and Tessa out there (I honestly don't like Tessa). I'm glad they somehow devoted this series to the former pair and how regular student life is treating them.",1295395200,,430,4.3875
4189111,5,B003SPDS8U,"Although I am starting this review, my son will finish it.

What are the good points about this anime -- it makes fun of the entire Full others.  Too bad there are not too many others quite like it.  So far we have seen gigantic robots that lost their story plot rather quickly or something so full of nudity or barely clothed girls that it made it difficult at best to watch.  NOT THIS SET THOUGH.

The main characters are ridiculus in a scary movie type of way.  Just think of an ex-military guy going to high school without any idea about girls, fun, or anything else us normal people take for granted.  In one episode the ex-military guy has rigged explosives to lockers because he knew someone had gotten inside it.  Later he discovers that it was just a girl who wrote him a love letter and dropped it off in the vents of his locker.

Now if you can handle this type of humor than you will definitely like this show.  I have never seen the original Full Metal Panic, but plan on purchasing it after seeing this show.  Even if Full Metal Panic winds up being more dramatic than this set, I think it will be still be worth watching, because so far this has been the best anime I have seen.",1294963200,4,1193,4.257777777777778

_
Anyways, the series was funny then as it is funny today. Special mention goes to the Rugby manning up episode! Still gives me a chuckle every time I pop in the disc. Kyoto Animation where still bouncing back and forth btw genres and unfortunately climaxing with '~the Second Raid' to never to this day again return back to the crazy Awesome of cool action. (sob)
_
The series is a great pick, but I sadly must write that if you've already bought the show on DVD.. the purchase of this is questionable. Sure, you get a sharper image. The audio is no different and that's it~ The supplements are NIL and ZIP with the generic OP / ED without text and a promo for other junk from Funi~
_
Buy it if you're a FMP fan like I (who has bought all 3 on Blu~)and take comfort that if you already have the DVD, you'll not be missing much here. I Do write that if you really want to see FMP at its clearest. BUY '~The Second Raid' on BLU-RAY! The supplements are Awesome and the format was made in the former to boot!
