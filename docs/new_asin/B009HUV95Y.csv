It's true that a lot of events in the movie are not explicitly spelled-out, but I think that adds to the creepiness and sense of mystery.  I was glad I didn't read any synopses before I watched the movie, because it went in a completely different direction than I was expecting.  I get tired of movies that all follow the same plot formula, and I thought this movie had some good twists.  The blood seemed a bit gratuitous at times, though.  It held my interest!",1371340800,,528,4.402061855670103
8541648,1,B009HUV95Y,"When I read about the film in the Redbox, it reveals information that is not revealed in the film until the last 5-10 minutes. I won't do that per se, but the film is so bad, spoilers won't matter.

Full figured Dr. Kimmy Gabriel (Bridget McGrath) can not have a child, but keeps on trying. She is very pro-life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell). She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself. The film jumps to seven years later as the world is thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare as Kimmy and her son David (Rocko Hale) live in a run down tenement living off government MRE handouts.

The film has heavy religious messages as both lesion faced Kim and Roger are very religious and frequently read from the Bible and listen to radio preachers. This appears to be a ""come to Jesus film"" except the ""good guys"" do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves. Indeed, if anything they appear to be part of the problem which is to make a statement about the condition of human existence.

This film is very low budget. The sets are meager. The acting is bad and dialouge has a religious corniness to it. It fails to get interesting until 10 minutes before the final credits and by then you pray for the end.

Knowing the ""secret"" of the film by reading the by-line I couldn't help but think during the film...""Funny. He doesn't look Jewish.""

8541649,1,B009HUV95Y,DO NOT waste your money or a moment of your life on this simply awful movie. Surely one of the five worst movies I have ever seen.,1357776000,2,130,3.8518518518518516
8541650,1,B009HUV95Y,"And I don't mean that in the sense that this was a thriller that will horrify you. The plot, The acting and especially the ending were HORRIFIC!
REDBOX OWES ME$1.20 for putting that crap in the machine......",1356048000,2,207,4.621621621621622
8541651,1,B009HUV95Y,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  I enjoy horror movies of all kinds, giving low-budget movies a chance when I can.  Not only did this movie have a plot that was revealed in only 10 minutes of dialog at the end, the acting was atrocious and the movie moved slower than molasses in January.  There was no thrill, no horror, nothing.  Don't even waste the energy to click the mouse to stream it for free.  A must miss.",1355788800,2,438,4.2926829268292686
8541652,1,B009HUV95Y,"This is one of those films that might have been good on paper, but was not executed well at all. Although it does have a depressing, foreboding atmosphere to it, you can't help but laugh at the visuals errors and the plot errors.

A woman doctor works in a fertility clinic. I am not a doctor, so forgive me at this point for my following description. She is shown using x-ray visual equipment with a huge screen impregnating a patient with tubing and wires and the like. Later, the doctor herself goes into a BATHROOM stall with a couple pieces of tubing and walks out pregnant. She is so pregnant from the two minute bathroom stall encounter with a plastic tube that she is able to go home that night and announce her pregnancy to him. At this point I had to ask ""Really?"" It didn't happen, but I expected the next scene to be her waking up the next morning and announcing she had the baby overnight and it had already graduated college.

Later in the film, there appears to have been an apocalypse. She is in a dilapidated unheated apartment. She is filthy. Her and the now older son are dirty, in coats, and starving. But she has a a fresh French manicure.

The world is not safe. The streets are full of crime. When people are dying now, they leave their clothes right where they were. Her and the boy try to make an escape, and smash the right front passenger window to vehicle to drive away in. They are shown a few minutes later driving away with all the windows intact.

At the end, the mother is shot. She crawls across the floor on her belly to a crucifix on the floor and grabs it, and passes out face down. Next shot, she is laying on her side holding the crucifix and the urn with the ashes of her dead husband. How did she get rolled over and holding the urn?",1355011200,2,1774,4.286567164179105
8541653,1,B009HUV95Y,"I rented this film the other night, and it was by far the worst movie I have seen in a long time. By the look of the movie cover, I assumed that it would be a film a bit like ""The Omen"" with its ""Damien"" antichrist child at the helm of the plot. How wrong I was! The child, although featured on the cover which makes you believe that he will be the star of the movie, barely makes an impact (but perhaps the actual child's acting is the best in the film, even though he barely has any lines, because the other actors cannot act for s@*t). The movie revolves extremely loosely around the plot of a female obstetrician (which they don't ever even say the correct name for her profession, they actually call it ""baby doctor"". Ridiculous!) who implants herself with an embryo cloned from DNA found on the Shroud of Turin, which of course they don't tell you how they came across Christ's own biological material, and then gives birth to a baby who is the antichrist, however there is nothing much that this child does that would lead you to believe that he is what he is. After the child is born, the United States is plunged into some kind of biblical turmoil, something out of the book of Revelation, although again, they do not state for the advancement of the plot that this is what is happening, you just have to play on what you may have learned in Sunday school with the boils, and spoiled food supply, etc. Then there is the doctor who started it all. I could have done without this guy completely. His character is a born again Christian (which there is nothing wrong with, don't misunderstand me) who thinks he is just so great and because he somehow (must have been miraculous) is the one who came across the holy DNA, he's the one who starts the whole program of human cloning. Ugh...I just don't even know how to review this film. It was so bad, so boring, and I don't even know why anyone wasted money on this project. If you like films about the so-called ""bad seed"" child, stick to ""The Omen"", because the only word for this film is waste.",1354924800,3,2051,4.357702349869451
8541654,1,B009HUV95Y,"If you need a nap or have trouble falling asleep, then I can recommend this movie.  What I was able to glean from it, while I was still awake, was that if we don't outlaw abortion and stem cell research, then the inevitable result will be a liberal President who will allow human cloning to  take place which will lead to a devil child being born who will smite the earth with all sorts of bad stuff.  Really, a rather poorly veiled piece of propaganda crap.  And not even well written, acted, choreographed, or edited.  But, like I said, a decent snooze enhancer.",1354665600,2,564,4.436893203883495
8541655,1,B009HUV95Y,"This was an awful movie... It starts with a fertility doctor, who herself is infertile, agreeing reluctantly to help with a human cloning project.  The experiment, which is conducted with three Mexican women who face the decision to either take part in the project by having the cloned embryos implanted into them, or be deported, goes awry when the children are stillborn.  Yet, the doctor's pregnancy is successful.  Flash forward 7 years to an apocalyptic setting (with no explanation as to why things have turned out this way) where the doctor and her son, much like the rest of society, are living in extreme poverty in an extremely violent society. In addition, the mother has some unexplained disease.  It could be lung cancer or something, since she is seen smoking early in the movie, but, that's never specified, so, add that to the list of vague nonsense in the film.  This point is dragged on for some time, and, eventually, the mother goes to find the head doctor from the experiment.  At this point, she's informed that the cloned embryos were made using DNA from the Shroud of Turin, Jesus' burial cloth, and, that her son is essentially Jesus reincarnated.  He demands forgiveness and entrance into heaven, partly for killing his sister and her child earlier, one the many times you see kids die in this movie, with no reasoning for it.  In anger, he shoots the little boy's mom, then, kills himself.  The mom dies, and, is spirited away, as are many others in the movie, with no explanation as to how they're dying or anything.  The film ends with a man appearing in the room, and, he & the boy share a knock-knock joke, and the film ends.  What a piece of garbage!  I guess this is supposed to be a sort of rapture film, but, it's even crappy in that regard.  If you haven't seen this, don't bother.  There are many ways you could better waste your time.",1354665600,3,1872,4.61631419939577
8541656,3,B009HUV95Y,"After illegally implanting herself so she can have a baby, a woman pays for it later along with everyone else as the future deteriorates in the US.  There is a connection between this and her young son, shown later at age 7, but you can guess what it is from the DVD cover.  Creepy, and eerily shot with 35mm and some deliberate lack of focus.",1353456000,,343,4.2615384615384615
