6621606,4,B00NARLSX8,"I love a fun, family movie to get us in the Christmas spirit! I wasn't sure how much my five and six year olds would watch of a non cartoon but we sat down to watch A Belle For Christmas together.

With Dean Cain and Haylie Duff starring, I knew I would enjoy this movie with these well known actors. I did really like the movie and my kids actually sat through the whole thing. My five year old Paige is a dog lover so I think that kept her engaged even though the movie itself might have been a little old for her.

Glenn Barrows is a widower raising Elliot and Phoebe on his own. It describes him as a recent widower but hes already dating again in this movie which did rub me the wrong way a bit. But that aside, hes a good dad doing his best to raise them alone. When Belle comes into their lives, the puppy seems to be just what the kids need for a little joy and cheer in their lives.

Dads new girlfriend doesnt like the new dog much, probably because dogs have a better sense of people than people do! She makes the dog disappear and the kids go in a desperate search of her. Will Glenn see her for what she really is or continue to be fooled by her?

I have to say I found this movie a bit predictable BUT I think family movies often are and kids will probably enjoy this movie more than adults. I found it entertaining enough and it had a good message and sweet doggie to bring it all together. A Belle for Christmas is s good family friendly film to watch for the holidays.",1415059200,14,1485,4.0580204778157

6621633,4,B00NARLSX8,"There's heaps of dog themed Christmas movies out there, A Belle For Christmas isn't the greatest film ever made and certainly has its faults, but it's not that bad either.  Like most probably made either for TV or to go straight to DVD, this one sticks to the formula and uses a main actor from a decades ago past popular TV show (Dean Cain from Lois and Clark).  In fact this one has a few minor characters from other popular shows too, (Haylie Duff, 7th Heaven), although she would have about five minutes in total of screen time, and the back of the DVD lists Kristy Swanson as being from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, you're certainly not going to recognise her from that where she had a five second scene, but she does do a good job in this as you instantly dislike her character like you're supposed to.  She plays the new girlfriend of the widow Glenn played by Dean Cain.  She doesn't like his kids and they know it and in turn despise her too, they don't pretend to like her either. She's also allergic to dogs.  The kids are your main screen time characters though, this is a child character driven film, where these kids try to outwit adults to find and rescue their new dog. I've never seen any of these child actors in anything else, but they do an amicable job.

As I said the movie is quite enjoyable and although this basic plot is found on numerous Christmas dog DVDs, this one tells it better than most.  This is due to the fact the kids are given pretty much free rein by a lack of wanting to discipline by their father, since their mother is recently deceased I guess, to be as rude as they want towards those they don't like.  This may also be something some viewers may not like though.  A lot of the kids' dialogue between each other sounds more like adults talk. There's aspects such as you're wondering why is the neighbour's daughter still there, rather than just be sent home when a sudden babysitter is needed? Or better yet why isn't her mother asked to look after all the kids?  The best friend of the son's mother as well for that matter? The kids don't think to do obvious things that would solve situations such as one near the end where they use an older sister instead of to simply ring their dad, but I guess you can put that sort of thing down to them being kids, with kid brains and life experience. Since this is a looking for the dog film, obviously the dog doesn't have a lot of screen time. Thankfully the dog doesn't talk either. Sensitive get offended real easy type viewers could of course complain that it is the dark skinned boy of the group who knows how to steal a car and so forth or that a real dog placement charity wouldn't force a dog onto a family that clearly isn't ready for that responsibility, but I think most viewers will enjoy A Belle for Christmas.",1452211200,,2807,4.3499043977055445
6621634,2,B00NARLSX8,"After reading the reviews I thought I would give this movie a try, the acting wasn't the best and even the story line was lacking, it just didn't flow well, there were a few scenes that were were funny but not enough to want to watch over and over again.",1447372800,,254,4.1

6621666,2,B00NARLSX8,"We have a puppy that looks just like this one so we were the obvious suckers to pay to watch this movie.  I don't think anyone tried to bill this as a award-winning film, but the plot is beyond silly and portrays dog-ownership in an unrealistic manner.  Add to that the fact that the puppy only gets 5 minutes face time, at most -- probably due to lack of budget for animal trainers-- and you've got a movie to avoid.  Don't fall for that cute face on the ""poster""!",1419897600,2,465,4.202247191011236
