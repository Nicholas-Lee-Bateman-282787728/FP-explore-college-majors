4234187,5,B003ZJ954U,"This is a very intimate interview with Colin Wilson.  It takes place in his home, and you get a wonderful sense of his personality and intellegence.  He is still brilliant at 80!  This is definitely for the hard-core Wilson fan.",1353369600,,228,4.65
4234188,1,B003ZJ954U,"This is a blatant and disgusting ripoff, not a film or documentary at all really but someone's attempt to wring a few dollars out of Wilson's admirers (I was/am one). It contains virtually no information at all, only  long disjointed boring interviews with an aging, tired, slow Wilson or his wife, where he proudly displays his enormous output of books and rambles on forever about his ideas, nearly all old and infinitely more interesting in print or as fiction or philosophy than when coming cliche-like out of the mouth of this poor soul. Inbetween takes the film editor inserts hokey-spooky sci-fi effects music of Fifties vintage to indicate just how ""weird"" and challenging Wilson's ideas are, or are supposed to be, or were. It's completely embarrassing and manipulative. It might as well be an Alka-Seltzer ad. Basically there is not a frame of footage concerning Wilson's life, past, achievements, serious thinking, social circle, influence, success, literary position or lifestyle. An utter waste, not worth even free distribution.",1350345600,2,1042,5.2395209580838324
4234189,5,B003ZJ954U,"Have been a fan of Colin Wilson since first reading ""The Outsider"" back in 1977; his writings made a big impact on my life and worldview and since that first purchase I have in my collection over 70 books to Wilson's credit. I had the pleasure of meeting him in person back in 1990 when he ran a workshop at the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, NY--quite a marvelous occasion. During that workshop I also purchased a video of an interview that Colin Wilson gave with Jeffrey Mishlove of the Thinking Allowed series, entitled Colin Wilson: The High and the Low. It was indeed a treat to watch my favorite author again as he gave a most panoramic overview of his lifetime work. So, coming across this DVD I was eager to watch him yet again.

I was not disappointed. This particular interview with Colin Wilson delightfully takes place in the intimate setting of his own home in Cornwall, England; watching an older (he's now 80) Wilson, walking around and sitting in his humble abode and reminiscing about his early life and work, is perhaps my fondest encounter with this intriguing thinker and visionary to date. At first, it was somewhat distracting listening to Wilson speak while this varied-music soundtrack was incessantly vying for one's attention--but after awhile one grows assumed to it as it somehow seems to add to the full ambiance of the interview. It was also interesting to watch his wife, Joy--his companion for over 57 years being interviewed at the end of the DVD. The interviewers and creators of this DVD are to be commended for their efforts in weaving together this most cherished account of Colin Wilson. Also, watching the coming attractions have spurred my interest in purchasing future ""Reality Films"" productions.",1327190400,4,1737,4.868243243243243
4234190,4,B003ZJ954U,Although I enjoyed seeing and listening to Colin Wilson on this DVD I must say that it is very amateurish. The background music in some parts was hideous and added graphics poorly chosen and executed. I give it four stars based on content and that I am able to get to know someone who I admire greatly and see the more personal side of his life.,1318896000,3,345,4.242424242424242
4234191,3,B003ZJ954U,"It was nice to see a DVD with the thoughts of Colin Wilson on a number of subjects. He has written a huge body of work across many different genres and it's interesting hearing him discuss several of his works and their genesis. No question he's led a fascinating life. However, the quality of this DVD treatment is no better than many viral videos on YouTube - shaky camera, off-mic questions from the interviewer, etc. Let me make this clear to prospective buyers: this is basically an interview with Wilson. Period. We see a bit around his home at Cornwall and for fans like me that was nice to see. The interview, however, is poorly done and is distracted by a very annoying music track running through the entire film. There's a few attempts to ""spice up"" the video, but it's clearly a VERY amateur effort. Sometimes embarrassingly so. With that said, an hour and a half plus of listening to Colin Wilson makes this a must-see for Wilson fans. No, it's not well-done  - but that certainly isn't Wilson's fault. There are some great Colin Wilson comments, but for a ""produced"" DVD looking at ""The Amazing World of Colin Wilson"" - the subject deserved far better. Happy 80th on 6-26-11, Colin. We send you our love and all the best from the USA!",1308182400,17,1248,4.571428571428571
4234192,3,B003ZJ954U,"Pretty straight ahead interview with prolific science fiction author, who figures he's turned out an average of about three books a year over his life. An intimate look inside his life for fans and anyone who wants to learn more about this legend in his field.",1288483200,2,260,4.673913043478261
4234193,4,B003ZJ954U,"Colin Wilson is a very prolific British writer who has published something like 3 books a year for the last fifty years.  He's written all sorts of fiction, mostly science-fiction and mystery, and non-fiction about the occult and paranormal.  It is an amazing life, and even more amazing is that after all that writing (which makes Stephen King look like a slacker!), he still has plenty to say.  If you're a fan, this is a treat--an extended interview with the writer himself.  He knew T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Anthony Burgess, Vivian Leigh, Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe, Ionesco, Robert Graves and others of his generation, and he's not shy about telling tales out of school.  An obsessive reader (when does he have time?), he gives the viewer a tour of the large storage sheds around his property, each chock-full of books, an impressive collection as large as any mid-sized city library.  He's a writer's writer, who still loves to write, and although he hasn't achieved the success he might have wanted, he stands as an inspiration to every other writer.  After he discusses his own fascinating spiritual journey, his wife, Joy Wilson, tells her version of their lives together.  Yes, amazing.",1287360000,3,1198,4.955
4234194,4,B003ZJ954U,"The title says it all in this one. Colin Wilson has had an interesting and amazing life. This film provides an in-depth look at one of the most fascinating writers around. I was only vaguely familiar with his work prior to watching this and I was surprised to learn how many books he has published. From the very beginning when Wilson is explaining the storage sheds used for all of his books, you get a sense that he is much more humble man than some writers with nearly a tenth of the titles to their names. The film reveals some intimate details of his personal life including a suicide attempt. During the interview Wilson shares some intriguing insight into his own philosophies and his approach to writing.",1286409600,2,712,4.6141732283464565
4234195,4,B003ZJ954U,"Ghastly murders, ghoulish hauntings: Colin Wilson has charted them all within the span of his prolific--and profound--career. Since 1956 he has been astounding readers with his dissections of religion, death and the possibilities of human potential. And now his philosophies can be witnessed through more than pages: they can instead be offered on film.

""Strange Is Normal: The Amazing Life of Colin Wilson"" is the examination of both the author and his writing. Through lengthy interviews (which contain considerations on the occult, the afterlife and more), the film presents Wilson as a visionary. It deems his work a genius unparalleled--and, while this may be far too affectionate to be named fair, it is always entertaining. Viewers will be offered stories of ghosts and supernatural experiences; and, though some will doubt the validity of such claims, all will be intrigued by them.

""Strange Is Normal"" offers a fascinating glimpse into the life of an equally fascinating author. It will impress.",1285718400,3,1006,5.320754716981132
4234196,4,B003ZJ954U,"I've always been a huge fan of Colin Wilson's work, especially his books on crimes and serial killers, so I was eager to watch this lengthy interview with him.  I wasn't disappointed!  They talked of his writing life, how he became an even bigger success after writing The Occult, his near attempt at suicide, meeting Marilyn Monroe and much more.

What I found most fascinating about this interview was when he talked about Super Consciousness.  He was driving along one day feeling that the world was so very plain and boring, when he suddenly reached this state of consciousness where everything seemed incredibly interesting and wonderful.  He goes much more into depth on the subject, but now I've put in an order for his book Super Consciousness.  I'd like to learn more about those moments of absolute clarity.  Those ah-ha! Moments.

His publishing history is quite impressive and yet he's one of the most down-to-earth authors I've seen interviewed.  As an author myself, if I'm only one-tenth as successful I'll consider it a victory.",1285200000,5,1044,4.954022988505747
8410428,5,B003ZJ954U,"If you are a fan of the Outsider and Colin Wilson's others books and the man, this is an excellent film. It is very casual so gives you ""an insiders"" (pardon the pun) view of his life. The interviewer is casual and it takes place in his house in England and in his study and he walks one through his property, and most of the interview is conducted in one of his library sheds on his property. It makes the interview very down to earth and very interesting. If you are interested in Psychology and Literature, this is an interesting DVD.",1437264000,,537,4.326732673267327
8410429,3,B003ZJ954U,its bizarrely produced.  But it s the information and the subject matter that is important.  That's all that matters. I highly value the direct conduit to Colin Wilson and that is what this doc has.  It is fascinating to see him in real life--he is a normal person.  But in his writings he is one of the few inspired beings on the planet...both for his imaginative fiction and his amazing insights into the paranormal.,1430611200,,418,4.608108108108108
8410430,5,B003ZJ954U,"It's amazing - that's for sure!  It's for everyone who still looks for a positive, affirmative way to live in a world where there is so much to come and to live for.  Thank you, Colin!  You changed the world for the better and for us who treasure you, your life and inspiration!",1426550400,,278,4.2075471698113205
8410431,5,B003ZJ954U,Great DVD of the amazing Colin Wilson. I will donate this DVD to the local University as it contains hard to find information. Great product for anyone wanting to know about philosophy.,1412985600,,185,4.8125
8410432,3,B003ZJ954U,"I enjoyed the one on one interview parts of this dvd, but the rest of the dvd is just infomercials for the film company. At the end of the actual footage about Wilson, which is an interview with his wife Joy, the video jumps right into the infomercials - no credits etc. like a typical documentary. So, that said, watch the relevant parts and ignore the rest. The dvd still worth buying, but it could have been done better. -- Oh, and too much back ground music for effect, which was intrusive at times. --",1409616000,,506,4.336842105263158
8410433,5,B003ZJ954U,"Yes, this is a simple filmed interview and, yes, the soundtrack is (as others have commented) atrocious and unnecessary! [Apparently the director thought adding a scary Sci-Fi soundtrack under the conversation would make it more interesting. Apparently he didn't think Mr. Wilson was interesting enough in his own right. He was wrong. The soundtrack is just an annoying distraction.] But....if you're a fan of Wilson's, this is as close as you can ever come (now that he is no longer with us) to having a one on-one conversation with one of the most genial and best-read men of the 20th Century.",1402012800,,595,4.900990099009901
8410434,1,B003ZJ954U,"The problem with this movie is that it was terribly filmed. It is a strain on the ears and eyes to make out anything being said and filmed. Wilson is an interesting guy, but I suggest you stick to his writing to get the flavor of what he has to say.",1395705600,,249,3.9019607843137254
8410435,4,B003ZJ954U,I've read a couple of Colin Wilson's books so it was awesome to get a glimpse into his life story. There's no way I would have predicted what this man would be like. I'll be rewatching this for sure.,1368921600,,199,4.128205128205129
8410436,5,B003ZJ954U,"I haven't read any of Wilson's books, but I will definitely be reading now that I've seen this cool bio on the man. A friend of mine who is a fan turned me on to this and I was very impressed. He's lived a hell of a life and I won't soon be forgetting this insightful dvd",1368835200,,271,3.7719298245614037
8410437,4,B003ZJ954U,It's not too often you get this intimate a glimpse into the life of a legend. When I ordered this I had no idea there was extensive interview footage with the man himself. That was the icing on the cake. Colin Wilson fans will love this.,1357776000,,237,4.173913043478261
