8346252,3,B001VFM60K,"i like daves work but this is a lil misleading. He is showing you how different guitar players might approach different bars in a blues progression. The description says riffs. he is just showing a lick or two in the style of. When it said riffs, i thought ""cool different riffs ideas  to play over  the rhythm""! nope, just licks. His essential blues is a lil better but this is still kinda cool.",1412640000,,396,4.410958904109589

8346254,3,B001VFM60K,"Definitely a beginner to intermediate instruction.  Good format but overly simple and short.  Not that enjoyable.  Dry.  Better blues DVDs out there too.  So middle road stuff, but best for beginners.",1340323200,,200,5.32258064516129
8346255,2,B001VFM60K,"What an exercise in frustration!  The DVD has a good conceptual framework but the translated idea is very poor and too many shortcuts were taken with the production.  There is no tab displayed on the screen or in a booklet for the user to follow so you have to keep going back and forth over the scene to write down what is being said. Each scene moves quickly into the next without any numbering or title to alert you.  The DVD menu does not allow you to go to a specific scene so you really have to guess or write down the time of the scene you want. Pity really, because if the DVD were done better, I would have given it 5 stars. Instead it barely gets two stars for the effort.",1294876800,,682,4.112781954887218
8346256,5,B001VFM60K,"This guy knows how to teach!  Learn authentic killer licks from the greats and it's done in a logical, pragmatic approach.  One minus, it would be convenient to have a tab book included.  -but it did make me write out the licks which was to my benefit and it was easy.  One of the best guitar dvd's out there.",1252281600,,309,4.186440677966102
8346257,2,B001VFM60K,"The good:  Dave Celentano is an engaging teacher who plays and demonstrates each lick very well.

The bad:  the organization of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  The DVD's purpose is to present blues licks that work over each portion of the blues progression, and while it accomplishes this, it would have been a lot more useful if there were a convenient way you could take individual licks by a particular artist and put them together into a complete solo, or better yet, if the DVD did this for you and presented them at the end.  Unfortunately, each artist's individual licks don't necessarily add up to a cohesive solo, so even if you wanted to patch one together, you probably couldn't.  Also, not all the artists appear in every section.  For example, Eric Clapton is completely missing from the section on measures three and four.

Finally, the ugly: navigation on the DVD really, really stinks.  It's impossible to see the introduction, for example, by choosing it from a menu.  Instead, you have to choose Play All, which takes you through the tuning-your-guitar section, then on to the introduction, then into the first section of instruction; if you want to go back and review the intro, forget it.  Similarly, it's really difficult to navigate to a particular set of licks (or two-bar section of the progression); you have to skip forward through two-bar section after section until you find the part you want.  This should be done through a fully-developed menu system, but it's not.  To recap, the individual licks are fine and Celentano does a good job, but the organization and navigation are dismal.",1248912000,2,1620,4.826086956521739
