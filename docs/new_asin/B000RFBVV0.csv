8200316,5,B000RFBVV0,"As with most Pentrex movies, this was a great two hour show, especially if you're into Santa Fe, Railroads in the San Bernardino/Los Angeles area, or like mid 1990s railroading.  I'd definitely give it a 5/5 rating and recommend it to all fans of the ATSF Railway.",1301011200,2,264,4.617021276595745
