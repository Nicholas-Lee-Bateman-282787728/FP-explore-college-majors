3697972,5,B001MFNB76,"Our kids love the Curious George DVDs and this particular collection of episodes is on par with all others.  Far too often in modern American society kids are discouraged from taking risks or being curious.  These Curious George DVDs portray a character exploring and enjoying the unknowns in life - sure he causes havoc, and gets into trouble, but he learns valuables lessons - ones that I will allow my children to learn (from successes and failures) in their futures.

Value is great - you get the usual eight episodes for around $13.",1240704000,,537,4.752688172043011
3697973,5,B001MFNB76,"I've seen all the episodes on this disc on TV with my son and all of them are excellent.  Spy Monkey and Rides a Bike are two particular favorites.  Here's a listing of the episodes that will be on this DVD:

Robot Monkey Hullabaloo - George creates an awesome robot outfit that's so good it fools everyone, even The Man with the Yellow Hat and Professor Wiseman. Will George end up on display at the museum's new robot exhibit?

Curious George, Spy Monkey - After reading his spy book ""Double-Oh Doggy,"" George goes undercover, trying to solve the mystery of what surprise The Man with the Yellow Hat is going to buy for George. Will ""Double-Oh Monkey"" crack the case?

Curious George Rides a Bike - George loves his new bike, but when he gets the chance to help Bill with his paper route, he hits a big rock and bends his wheel. Can George find the right tools to get rolling again?

Curious George vs. The Turbo Python 3000 - You must be eight licorice whips tall to ride the Turbo Python 3000, and George is only seven whips tall. George looks for ways to grow and it seems to work, but are his legs longer, or is his stomach fuller?

Monkey Fever - The Man with the Yellow Hat has come down with a terrible cold, and George decides to nurse him back to health by setting up the bedroom like a real hospital and using his own brand of monkey medicine.

The Lucky Cap - George is having a terrible day. But when The Man with the Yellow Hate gives George a new cap, all George's bad luck turns good! But when the cap shrinks, can George find a way to make his own luck?

Candy Counter - When George helps out at Cayley's candy counter for an afternoon, he quickly learns that eating candy is easy, but counting and sorting it is much more difficult!

Gutter Monkey - When Mr. Zoobel's snake, Bruno, sheds his skin, George heads to the pet store for an explanation. When he returns, he finds Bruno has escaped and George must wrangle him back to where he belongs.",1233705600,42,1964,4.3269754768392374

3697979,5,B001MFNB76,Great price! Great movie! My son lost the first copy of this movie. I can not believe I found it for a cheap price. 0.01 cent to be exactly.,1388275200,,140,3.8620689655172415

3697981,5,B001MFNB76,Bought this DVD to help entertain my 17 month old during a 3 hour car ride. He loves George! It's a great collection.,1372896000,,117,4.130434782608695
3697982,5,B001MFNB76,Curious George is always entertaining even though in trouble quite often.  My grandsons love him and learn valuable lessons at the same time.,1369440000,,141,5.130434782608695
3697983,4,B001MFNB76,"This DVD contains episodes from the wonderful Curious George PBS series.  Every episode is both fun and educational.  My daughter started watching the show at 2 1/2, and she really loves it.

Each Curious George cartoon concludes with a video of real kids demonstrating a concept from the episode.  Most of these are great, but one on this DVD is questionable.  In the segment after Monkey Fever, the children visit a naturopathic doctor.  He talks about the healing power of pressure points and magnets, two controversial practices.  This is just a short segment, though, and the rest of the DVD is very good.",1366243200,,610,4.864077669902913
3697984,5,B001MFNB76,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to sit him in front of the TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,3,832,4.20125786163522
3697985,5,B001MFNB76,"We have always and still enjoy the world of curious george. Who wouldn't enjoy this famous author's work? Since we have the book, our son also enjoys the animated action which helps him imitate what he sees.
The animations, the colors and just seeing how George goes about finding a solution to his problems gives us another dimension to anything we face. Our son who is now fascinated with robots and how they work keeps choosing this DVD when he gets, curious about his toy robots. But what is even more fun is that our son as a result of watching the robot episode from this DVD, challenged us to build our very own homemade robot. We take so much pride in it, so does he.",1358553600,,675,4.365079365079365

My 4yr old is really into robots right now and this one has a great episode with robots, as well as 7 other episodes. (as do all of the dvds) Plan to keep curious george around for my 2yr old as he gets older and probably for decades for when i have grandchildren.
