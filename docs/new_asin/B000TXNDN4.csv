a folk group. The Serendipity featured in this DVD is that with John Ross...They performed in television, Christmas specials,
etc some 20, 25 years ago. I live in Brazil, but I saw some of these shows in my visits to the USA. This DVD could be better.
Could feature some songs performed in Austria, showed on TV, but...since is the only available...it helps to bring some cherish
memories.",1376611200,,510,4.806818181818182
8211239,4,B000TXNDN4,"Musical Yuletide Celebration is what Christmas videos are supposed to be, traditional music and traditional Christmas scenes.  Though dated, the Serendipity Singers remind me of the Christmas specials that I always looked forward to on network TV in the 60's, 70's, and 80's.  This is not a HD recording but was still acceptable on my 46"" TV.",1325030400,,342,4.982456140350878
