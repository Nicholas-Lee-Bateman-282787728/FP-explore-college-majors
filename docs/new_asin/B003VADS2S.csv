8406587,2,B003VADS2S,The storyline was pretty bad and the main character was extremely cringey. Only gave an extra star because it captured Jamaica's best sights in an accurate way.,1520467200,,160,4.962962962962963
8406588,4,B003VADS2S,"Either you will like it or not. There is not really a compelling story. The movie just draws you in to the feeling of the main character as you follow him on his not so fun vacation. If you just sit back and try to experience what he is, you will enjoy it.",1517616000,,256,3.849056603773585

8406590,3,B003VADS2S,"A naive young New-Yorker goes to Jamaica in a search for a true Jamaican tunes (?) and got it near all.

I feel it is a very prejudice story of a robbed Westerner making (or not yet) it to the US Embassy through the country with no money, food and some limited communication. Semi naked, an actor looks better than even in a white suit, which is deployed by movie-makers cleverly. And some homoerotic notes are also in the air.

Easy watching.",1366588800,,443,4.390243902439025
8406591,5,B003VADS2S,This movie is a whole lot of fun! It's a simple film graced with some very natural acting. Sean Bones is hilarious without really trying. Now that's comedy,1338163200,2,155,4.571428571428571
8406592,2,B003VADS2S,"The best things about this movie were the excellent soundtrack and some of the location shots. However, the story left me heavily disappointed. Time Out London called it a ""Slacker's Odessey"", and I think the story writing is included in that.

The premise behind this movie sounded good. Main character (Max) gets dumped, goes on Jamaican cruise alone, gets robbed, stranded, and has an experience that changes his life perspective. Most of that was a fair assessment. But like in many indy movies that I've seen, they followed the trend of ending a tale by not ending it; leaving the audience waiting for results, and seeing nothing.

Max is a fairly nice variety of awkward slacker, but if he has some kind of change of perspective, we're given no indication of it whatsoever. The ride with our solo adventurer is certainly filled with interesting characters, but Max himself seems empty, bored and boring. Just when we've finished enduring his journey with him, and we're waiting for him to display some of his fresh wisdom in his Brooklyn-based world, we're kicked off the movie and stranded, ourselves. The 'laziest ending of a movie' award goes to...",1311552000,2,1157,4.9282051282051285
8406593,2,B003VADS2S,"Positives:
(1.) If that's cruise ship life - count me out.
(2.) Not likely to go to Jamaica either.
(3.) Filming and locals spot role recruitment not bad for such a small crew. Well, a bit (OK, a lot) disjointed but mark that down to stylistic creativity.

Negatives:
(1.) If there's a meaningful or believable story here I couldn't find it.
(2.) Acting and typecasting was too made-up/superficial.
(3.) And the point was?  Well, no point sometimes has it's value.
(4.) Perhaps the point was ""Never wear green framed glasses!""",1300924800,,526,4.833333333333333
