8418637,5,B0048CC37Y,Just watched this movie with my first grader and he loved it with the English subtitles! The movie is very catchy with great acting from everyone including the elephants. There are some great stunts which we are surprised how well they pulled off even at that age! Fun movie to watch with kids of all ages.,1437782400,,306,4.482142857142857

8418640,3,B0048CC37Y,This movie is one the biggest hits of Super Star Rajesh Khanna and is a movie which made him popular with kids who grew up seeing his future movies. This movie is about the relationship/bondage between man and animal. Elephants play an equally important role with Rajesh Khanna in the movie and the movie revolves around them. Tanuja playing the heroine also contributes. The movie has excellent music by Laxmikant Pyarelal who have composed some great hits for this movie sung by Kishore Kumar. One song of Mohammad Rafi is a class. The movie is a must see for movie watchers of all ages and especially the kids will enjoy this classic.,1301961600,2,637,4.696428571428571
