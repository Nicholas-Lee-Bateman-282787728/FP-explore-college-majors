I noticed that he found documents, illustrative stories, objects, and archaeological/architectural sites that are out-of-the-ordinary as examples to illustrate the major threads of history.",1396742400,3,287,6.384615384615385
5612053,5,B00BEYWW4I,"I have a very extensive and in depth formal Jewish education and even I learned new things that I did not know. It is presented in a very interesting  and imformative manner. It does include Schama's own views but they are clearly made in a manner that is in the open and not hidden.

I highly recomend the show which is now on PBS. Try it and make up your own mind. I plan on getting the dvd  when it comes out in May.",1396656000,64,419,3.9642857142857144
5612054,1,B00BEYWW4I,"I fully agree that this was a highly selective telling of ""the story"" of the Jews, one which was ultimately ideology and not history and told by reading history backwards in order to justify much (if not all) of Israeli history.  The main way that Schama does this is by providing little or no context for his audience to understand why what is happening is happening when it happens.  Events for the most part just happen without broader historical causes and as such are presented as being almost inevitable (this is in part what I mean by saying that Schama reads history backwards in order to construct the story he wants to tell.  Put another way, Schamas story is a ""Zionist"" story of the Jews....something that Schama admits in the program itself by telling ""us"" that he is a Zionist and unapologetic about it.

To those who say this is a ""story"" and not a ""history"" to justify the way Schama crafts his tale, I think you are being disingenuous here and playing semantic games.  The ""story"" he is telling is a history story.  More troubling though is that Schama calls his tale the story of the Jews and not a story of the Jews as if this is the only story or narrative that can be told.  In fact, there are very different ways to read Jewish history or the story but because Schama (and PBS) presents this as the story which means it will be much more difficult if not impossible for others to tell (or raise the money to be able to tell) a very different story of the Jews.
Indeed, historians have and make choices about what they present.  No historian can present everything.  But historians do have an obligation to be honest and not to selectively present facts in order to tell the story they want to tell (and ignore others that might contradict this story) i.e., one that confirms the conclusions they have already reached and the message they want their audience to get.

Indeed it may be going too far to say that the Romans were ""tolerant"" of the Jews but it also going just as much too far to try and claim that the Romans went after or singled out the Jews (because they were Jews) in a way that was different from how the Romans treated other people's they conquered.  Did the Romans truly treat the Jews worse or differently than they treated other peoples they conquered and if so how?  Schama does not talk about this or make the case for it at all.  This is but one example of where and how I think he is highly selective in what ""facts"" he chooses to present in order to craft a ""story"" of the Jews that ultimately fits his ideological (if not explicitly political) agenda.

As Ive already said, one of the biggest problems with the ""story"" that Schama tells (in addition to how selective he is in what he chooses to present) is that he gives little or no broader historical context for people to understand why what is happening is happening.  So, for example he talks about anti-Semitism in the middle ages and how it develops (I am forgetting the Roman emperor who he sights as first turning the Jews into ""devils"") but he doesn't even try to explain why?  He tells us that Jews for the most part fared better under Islam (for the most part) then they did under Christianity but that this changes.  Again, no real explanation as to why or what caused this.  Why does Christianity change?  He does mention that Paul is the bad guy (along with the Roman Emperor whose name Im forgetting) but fails to mention that serious Christian Biblical scholars say that there were at least 2 Pauls (i.e., that pauls letters/epistles are written by at least two people and that one Paul seems to completely contradict the other and some of these contradictions have to do with the relationship between Jews and the new Christians) but again he doesnt talk at all about the debates going on within Judaism (or early Christian sects at the time most if not all of which still considered themselves Jewish).  He also paints in overly broad brushes when he talks about Islam and Christianity as if these were virtual monoliths and behaved the same everywhere in their relations with and treatment of the Jews (although he does mention that the Polish kingdom welcomed Jews and hints at rivalries between different medieval Christian kingdoms).  What about Moorish Spain?  Was this the same as Christian Spain?  One wouldnt even necessarily know that there were even two Spains let alone if there was any difference in the way Jews were treated in the two.  Not to mention that there is no mention that 1492 is not just the year that the Jews were expelled from Spain but also that this was the year the Moorish Spanish Kingdom was defeated and Spain unified as a Christian country.  Were these related and if so how and if not why not?  And, again there is no broader context here that talks about any of this in relation to the other major development during this period which is the rise of capitalism.  Is there no relationship between the resurgence of anti-Semitism and the rise of capitalism?  The same goes for England where in the 16th century we also begin to get the enclosures and the dispossession of the English peasantry.  Does this have nothing to do with the resurgence of anti-Semitism?  Given that Schama does not talk at all about the rise of capitalism in general -- let alone the enclosures specifically or the history of the heretical Christian movements in the middle ages which sometimes went after the Jews in the same ways that they went after the Church  (he only talks about the rise of industrial capitalism in the 19th century but capitalism in fact develops centuries earlier) one has no way of knowing these are even issues in the story of the Jews.

Events for Shama seem to just happen without broader reasons or causes and thus are presented as some ways as if they were inevitable.  For example, he talks about the Enlightenment and says it holds out the promise of Jews being accepted but that this was simply not possible.  But here too it strikes me that Schama is being both highly selective and disingenuous.  First of all he seems to present the Enlightenment in general as representing progress except for the Jews.  But this isn't so at all.  For example, it was during the Enlightenment (and the birth of modern liberal political philosophy) that we also see the return of and justification for slavery (this time on a racial basis) not to mention the burning of hundreds of thousands of mainly women as witches.  So, the Enlightenment is also tied to the rise of modern racism and not just anti-Semitism (as well as the intensification of the dispossession of millions of peasants from the land in order to create the modern wage laboring working class).  In addition, when he talks about Enlightenment ideas, for the first time (unless I missed it earlier on in the program) he talks of an (Enlightenment) Jewish Philosopher is Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786).  What about Spinoza (16321677) who is a much more important philosopher and who in many ways lays the basis for 18th century Enlightenment thought?  Could it be because Spinozas philosophy is much more radical and questioned many of the basic tenets accepted by orthodox Judaism and the Jewish theological elite?

But, the most egregious case of this is when he talks about the anti-Semitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during a period in which Jews tried to fit in and or assimilate into the broader European (secular?) culture.  Schama basically says that this was not possible and thus had to lead to the Nazis.  Now, I am not suggesting that there was not widespread anti-Semitism in Europe during this period but that is very different from trying to paint the Nazis and the Holocaust as inevitable.  Schama thus never lets his audience know that in even in the last election in 1933 in Germany (which brought the Nazis to power) that the Nazis only got roughly 40% of the vote (i.e., they never got a majority of the German vote) and that the German socialists and communists combined got 60% of the vote and thus had the German left presented a united front for the election the Nazis never would have come to power.  Not to mention that there is no mention of the punitive reparations placed on Germany by the Allies after World War I which were a principle cause of ruining the Germany economy (or insuring that it couldn't recover after the War).  Had these reparations not been placed on Germany it is likely that the new democratic Weimar Republic would have had a real chance of succeeding which also may well have meant no Nazi regime.  But, no, for Schama the Nazis are presented as being virtually a foregone conclusion with no real discussion of what gave rise to them or what brought them to power.  The reason I think is that it is far easier to justify both the founding of Israel as it was founded as well as subsequent Israeli govt policies if one makes the case that there was no other choice given that the Nazis and the Holocaust were inevitable in Europe (i.e., it was not possible for the Jews ever to be treated decently or for there to have been any other result other than attempted genocide against them).

Finally, Schamas story about the Israel is also highly selective at best.  For example, he mentions in passing that there were anti-zionist Jews.  Really?  Who were they?  What did they want/stand for?  We are never told.  Nor are we told that there were Jews (e.g., Martin Buber and Hannah Arendt to name two) who opposed the founding of a Jewish state and instead called for a bi-national secular state that would include both Jews and Palestinians as equals (in part because they presciently understood that a single Jewish state would lead to unending bloodshed between Jews and Arabs).  Schama talks to a setter (clearly, by accent, a former American Jew) but does not talk to or show us any Jew actively opposing the settlement movement or who calls for a return to an Israel of pre-1967 borders.  He simply says to us that he has problems with the settlers who have a vision of continuing to expand Israeli borders.  That is the spectrum of Jewish thought on this matter?  Hardly, the full story.

In the end, I was not surprised by the story that Schama told.  I would not have expected much more or much different from such a conservative and self-proclaimed Zionist historian (who in his most widely read book, Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution basically comes out against the French Revolution and says it wasn't necessary and that France would have become the democratic republic it became even without it.while railing against the violence of the Jacobins and Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau without ever mentioning the worse reactionary white terror that followed Jacobin rule).
Finally, and in a sense what is most troubling about Schamas story is that those with no other reference points will take his story as the story (just as he wants them to) and will not question or understand that there are in fact very different ways to read and understand Jewish history  and thus to tell the story of the Jews.",1396483200,37,11110,4.656938044034818

5612056,1,B00BEYWW4I,"I watched this on PBS.  It is not a history of the Jews.  It is selections, a story the theme of which is: well, we tried a bit to fit in but horrible things happened and now Israel can do horrible things to other people and you should shut up about it - ignore that 3 to 6 billion a year US taxpayers give to Israel.

He does not deal with the founding of the religion but dates it to 3000 years ago - something that other scholars place later.  He does not go into the evolution of ""God"" but says it is the the first monotheistic religion, ignoring older Zoroastrianism.  At what point did Judaism give up the others gods implied, in the commandment, ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me.""  God, thinks there are other Gods?  If so is that really monotheism or just paying attention to one?

We are presented with a city from the time of David - except that has not been proven - the whole list of kings in the Bible is being challenged by archaeology.  We are given the story of the slaves in Egypt without being told that scholarship is now clear; no mass slavery in Egypt; Exodus didn't happen.  So how is the religion reacting to one of the main holy days and foundation stories being contradicted by archaeology?  How do you continue to grieve for something that didn't happen?  (I'm religious and all religions have, in my opinion some of this.)

Does he help us with these contradictions?  No.  How is Judaism dealing with the new information?  Is it the same as in Christianity where some are reading it as metaphor and others are demanding it's fact, sticking their heads in the ground and tantruming?

Romans gave Jews special status under law.  They did not persecute them until they refused to pay their taxes.  Greeks and Romans both allowed them not to worship the state Gods, the only group that I am aware of allowed to not do so.  Anyone not worshiping the state Gods courted disaster from the Gods for the entire community.  Schama doesn't tell us this.  Instead he complains that Rome's elite didn't want to have dinner with Jews but they didn't want to have dinner with Greeks either  and they respected and resented the Greeks.

Jews, like all people, do good things and bad things.  The good and bad of history is not presented.  Anyone who pays compound interest will resent the holder of the loan.  Nothing about the repression of women, or the extreme intolerance practiced by some of the ultra-orthodox and right is mentioned.  Frankly, I think they would probably kill me for some of my beliefs/practices.

All the examples of persecution of Jews are legit.  Yet he doesn't take on the nastiness of the Bible's Book of Hebrews. That would probably offend too many viewers, (or get them to agree!) and Shama is more interested in the end of his story and the defense of Israel's current indefensible government.  Nothing about the Crusades, the popes, the Bible.  Safer subjects such like political figures get the brunt of his wrath.

For Roman attitudes to the Jews, try Kenneth Harl's lectures for the Teaching Company.  For the formation of Judaism, I recommend Karen Armstrong's The Bible, A Biography and A History of God.  The latter is, regretfully, a history of just Western God. I'm also very fond of reading Heschel.

I forget the name of the Rabbi, (Heschel?) who when asked to boil Judaism down to it's core said, ""Don't do to others what you don't want done to you.  The rest is commentary.  Go and study it.""

So, if this Golden Rule is the essence of Judaism, is Israel currently a Jewish state or has it lost its faith and become something else? There is one interview and some pictures of the poor Palestinians forced out of their village.  The wall is shown - and it's a wall not a ""barrier"".  But not the day to day misery.  (Watch 5 Broken Cameras for that.) Thankfully Shama does side with the zealot and the wars to come when his Zionist zealot proclaims the Jewish state ""to the Tigris and Euphrates, to the sea beyond.""

What I see happening to the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank is coming very close to what the Nazis did to the Jews in Warsaw.  What do you call it when hundreds of thousands of Arabs are pushed out of their homes and surrounded by walls, trade routes cut off, water rationed, food rationed?

All this is justified by the Holocaust.  Six million Jews died.  Yes, beyond horrible.  But five million others died also as well, a total of 11 million.  Killed by category were: Poles (2.5 million!) Soviets, especially prisoners of war, the mentally ill, the deaf, the physically disabled, the mentally retarded, homosexuals, transsexuals, communists, social democrats, socialists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  Is there any group in history that has not had some terrible wrong in their history?  Even aristocrats periodically lose all.  Do Poles, the deaf, gays or Jehovah Witnesses now have the right to go to Israel and say, our sacred book and our suffering give us the right to this land?  We suffered and you did nothing so now it's ours?  No.  At some point, the suffering must end and I would argue tolerance for those who do not deserve it is needed for peace - thank you Desmond Tutu.  Yet, we must be intolerant of intolerance if we are to live in peace.

18 to 24 million Soviets died in WWII.  Does that give them the right to annex Crimea?  What about Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, or the rest of the Soviet Union?  At what point does it end?

Usually minority groups compliment the majority by becoming like them - even gays now want all the same right and responsibilities as straights.  Groups that go off and reject the majority historically do not fare well - even within Judaism!  Jews are far from the only ones having a turbulent history.  There are Jews that assimilate and give up their religion.  Yet, millions do not.  That interests me. And gets my respect.  I too like aspects of my culture, the dominate culture, and am a member of subcultures.

However, my respect ends with what is happening now, as I write, in Israel, Gaza and the Occupied Territories.  When Schama says we have no right to criticize Israel because we do not live there (he actually says that!) he gives up reason, the whole Western tradition of rationalism and the core of Judaism -""don't do to others what you don't want done to you"".  He demands we stand mute while others are abused and killed.  To go ""Israeli"" now means to respond in extreme overreaction.  To me it is not a loving act, to either party to stand silent, mute when people are killed or harmed.  And to continue to give 3 to 6 billion in my US tax payer ""aid"", used largely for the military and freeing up funds for ""settlements"" well, some of that money is mine and no, no, no.

By the by, someone please write a good history (good and bad acts, both please) of the Jews. (And the Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus please.)  For the good and bad of the United States, I recommend Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States.

Schama wrote a ""story"" not a history.  I recommend his Citizen, a history of the French Revolution.  That's good.",1395705600,35,7096,4.566217287866772

Historian Simon Schama explores the Jewish experience, spanning over 4,000 years.  From the Ancient Israelites and the origin of the Hebrew bible to the very impact the Jewish people are having today in creating the world we all live in...from culture, to science to entertainment.

Episode 1:  Traces the Jewish experience from tribal beginnings to the destruction of the Jewish High temple by the Romans.

Episode 2: Medieval Jews struggle to preserve their identity under the rule of Christianity and Islam.

Episode 3: How the enlightenment allows Jews to integrate into modern European culture and commerce.

Episode 4: How the Jewish people of Eastern Europe made their mark on the modern world.

Episode 5: how the Holocaust and the creation of Israel have changed what it means to be a Jew.

5612118,3,B00BEYWW4I,"Simon does a very good job at describing the brilliance of the Jewish people and their tragedies.  Where he goes wrong is when he attributes usury to being forbidden in Christianity.  Come on, Simon!  There are many passages in the Hebrew Scriptures forbidding usury including the prophets!  Next, Paul did not say the Jews as a nation had murdered YAH'SHUA.  In fact, Paul's letter to the Romans and throughout the NT, shows how much Paul loved his people and wanted their salvation.  He always went to synagogues first, prayed in the Temple and celebrated all the Jewish holidays.
When Simon mentions the Trinity, he is out of his depth.  In ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis, a very descriptive essay is given explaining (as far as one can),  the Trinity.
I fully agree with Simon about John Chrysostom's jealously toward the Jews, for that is what is was (and is) with all people who hate the Jews.  So my Father told me when I was quite young.
Finally, Simon's utter outrage and profound grief about Israel's struggle for survival right up to the present day come shining through and I fully share both emotions.  There is absolutely no excuse for Jews or anyone to be persecuted for their beliefs or lack thereof and 2000+ years of persecution by the churches did help bring about the Shoah.
The Jews have a right to have Israel as their nation.  They belong there and they are an example to the nations as long as they remember justice and mercy.  They are intelligent enough to live peacefully side by side with Palestinians, Muslim or Christian.  And as Paul wrote, ""God's call to the Jews is irrevocable.""  YAH'SHUA said, ""salvation comes from the Jews.""  Gentiles are invited because God wants salvation for all.  We are all Jews!",1466726400,14,1741,4.73421926910299

5612124,4,B00BEYWW4I,"Excellent overall but with a few glaring segments of the Jewish History missing:

1. The first 4 episodes leave you with the impression that the Jewish diaspora spanned mostly European countries, yet
 on the last episode we discover that Jews from North Africa and the vast Middle East immigrated to Israel and make up
 50% of the population there.
 - Why is there no coverage of the history of Jews in Arab countries? - Didn't their history matter? - Is there no info on them?

2. An additional episode about what the Land of the Jews has become, could have made the picture more complete.
- Israel is a highly advanced country when it comes to Scientific and Technological achievements, but is a very tough
place to live in on the social level because ethnic (intra-Jewish) tensions and strong racism-undertones are rampant.
- The Israeli culture is generally very harsh and disorderly. Israel is a very divided society on many levels.
- Ironically even though Jews remained Jews throughout history because they held on to their religion, 80% of the population
in Israel is Secular and there is deep hostility by the large Secular Jewish population towards the minority of Orthodox Jews in Israel.

As miraculous as the survival of the Jews has been and the eventual creation of a State for the Jewish people, Israel still is
a troubled melting pot for Jews from around the globe and is a very stressful country to live in on a personal level.

For decades, many Israelis of 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation who detest life in Israel keep emigrate to counties where they feel better,
be it Europe, Canada, the US (preferably..) and more. Israeli-born Jews obviously identify themselves as Jews, but
are mentally and psychologically a breed-apart from Jews who remained (or came from) abroad. Israeli-born Jews have a kind
of pride, identity, and fearlessness that could have only evolved by people who grew up in their OWN sovereign land.

Regardless of how many Israelis literally run away from Israel and move abroad, it is critically important for Israelto remain the eternal state
of the Jewish people for all Jews who feel persecuted or insecure wherever they live. Recent examples to that is the immigration
of a Million+ Jews from the former Soviet Union in the 90s as well as the migration of Ethiopian Jews or more recently of many French Jews
who chose to immigrate to Israel in the wake of the terrorist events of 2014, 2015.",1463356800,,2433,4.803827751196172

5612142,5,B00BEYWW4I,"This one is a bit different from most History Channel-style narratives.  Here, Schama is not the historian who happens to be a Jew, he presents himself as a Jew who happens to also be a historian.  He has a story to tell, and his training helps to tell it well.  This does not mean Schama sheds all pretense of the detached historian, but this work is very personal to him and his passion and willingness to be uncomfortable on camera helps make for a more compelling show.

This is not so much a story of how the Jews relate to God, but how Jews related to the world. This is not a bible study; it is a story of what happens outside the events in the bible.  Schama makes a case for what Jews share in common and how they survived culturally.  He delves into the roots of anti-semitism in many forms and produces several cogent reasons why.

The series ends with an attempt to cover Zionism, the state of Israel, and the conflicts of our time.  There is little hope of covering it all in a few episodes so Schama focuses on explaining Zionism and its evolution from dream, to theory, to practice.  Expect no explicit solutions to the problems, nor polemics in support of, or against the Israeli government.  (and really, that is not his job)  However I still felt like the end was compressed, scattered, and not really finished.  Maybe it is just this historian's version of a cliffhanger.  Either way, I will likely buy more episodes, if they are ever made.",1454198400,7,1459,4.460377358490566

5612178,5,B00BEYWW4I,"It's an excellent documentary. Poetic, articulate, and although by necessity indirect about contemporary Jewish/Arab crisis, this documentary will help you understand the historical undercurrent of Jewishness. As a human being, it's simply impossible not to be angry and frustrated to see how Jews have suffered, and been through such brutality in recent past. As for contemporary problems related to Israel, I didn't expect any grand solution here, this is just a ""story,"" and attempt of establishing a bridge. But it's not a fairy tale either, nor does it suffer hopelessness. It's very difficult for Jews not to be cynical about the world around them, since history discourages them to be otherwise; but I think, as does Simon Schama, it's also a paradoxically Jewish trait to be hopeful and dream about ""Somewhere, over the rainbow...."" On a different note, painful issues of geopolitics swept aside, I take this moment of reviewing as an opportunity to express my gratitude to people of Jewish heritage, past and present, for their contribution to humanity as a whole.",1426204800,,1073,5.208092485549133

5612203,5,B00BEYWW4I,"The images that this documentary casted in my mind have helped me illustrate the timeline of Jewish History and build a skeleton for building a more thorough understanding and incorporating additional information.

The presenter, who is Jewish, is obviously biased, but he is transparent, upfront and unapologetic about it, which makes me trust his opinions and weight them with the right measure. His emotions, sometimes strong, convey a lot of information.

The documentary traces the struggle of the Jewish people from the destruction of their temples to their integration attempts in the most diverse nations, up to the born of Zionism and the establishment of the Jewish State, Israel. He does not avoid the Israel-Palestine conflict and presents a reflection on the matter.

The presenter actually went filming all over the World, to the places where the stories he tells actually happened. I would like to stress this point, because nowadays there a lot of fiction-reality documentaries that mostly recreate stories in a studio. This is not one of those at all, and you can expect really beautiful and authentic imagery, as well as interviews with first-hand witnesses.

The music of this documentary also needs special mention. Although I didn't see the authors in the credits (or I just failed to find them), I traced its proper music to Avshalom Caspi. You can listen to the music on Caspi's homepage, or on Soundcloud.",1419897600,,1429,5.120171673819742

5612232,1,B00BEYWW4I,"What mind could conceive of this trainwreck of a so-called documentary? This does not tell the story of the Jews. It is propaganda and the message is that assimilation is the basis for Jewish survival. At every opportunity he uses the Jews who succumbed and assimilated to the gentile world of Christians and Muslims to explain the basis for survival.  He endeavors to show the history of the Jews who have survived thousands of years by holding true to their tradition, but instead documents Torah service with the modern Reform movement an invention of the last century and the one that fundamentally rejects traditional observance of Torah and denies its divine origin. He totally skips over the Exodus from Egypt and the revelation at Sinai, takes us to the Babylonian exile without ever mentioning anything about the Bet HaMikdash (The Holy Temple) except that it's haphazardly rebuilt after return from Babylon and that the Jews that welcomed the exiled were soon schooled in the brutality of Torah observance. This is the one theme that permeates this monstrosity is the ""curse"" of Torah law. He lambastes Ezra and Nehemiah as shameful extremists and sympathizes with the Jews who had intermarried and assimilated to gentile living. At every chance, he ridicules observant Jews as close-minded relics. He quotes Josephus ""To be Jewish is simply to observe the laws."" Sadly, the irony seems to be lost on him.",1418428800,9,1415,5.0212765957446805

5612262,4,B00BEYWW4I,"This was a most enlightening program. It help me clarify much of what I had learned previously. I had hoped for more information on the diaspora in the centuries following the destruction of the temple in AD 70. This is the time in which the Jews spread far and wide, as far north as Denmark and as far east as China. The subject of genetic studies has brought forth many fascinating areas for reconsideration of this time frame and previously acceptable conclusions that are now much in need of revision. Judaism has had an impact on the societies into which it spread far beyond narrow precepts of non-assimilation and persecution. A simple path to grasping  the importance of Judaism is that the Jews contributed in powerful ways, for had they not done so then they would not have survived at all. It is to this point that I seek enlightenment. What were the factors that enabled the Jews of the diaspora to survive when so many other groups of peoples disappeared from history. To me this is a conundrum that demands answers.",1416441600,,1029,4.653846153846154

He has successfully and passionately convened this message to us. Thank You!",1415836800,,494,4.892857142857143

5612286,5,B00BEYWW4I,"Historian Simon Schama does an excellent job telling the story of the Jews from its earliest beginnings.

I look forward to enjoying more of his work.",1415577600,,344,5.634615384615385
5612287,5,B00BEYWW4I,"This documentary is one of Schama's best, and that is really saying something after seeing ""The History of Britain"" and ""The Power of Art"" which Schama did a few years ago. Schama turns his highly skilled critical and rhetorical eye, coupled with a ""detached"" historian's mindset that is, admittedly, somewhat diminished here due to the personal connection he has to this subject. But it is history spectacularly told, and does not follow the more common paths that might be typically expected, choosing rather to dwell on the somewhat lesser known, but nonetheless important, aspects of this multi-millennial story. The pace is rapid, and the passing of the centuries is covered in a very short time frame. It's glorious, heartbreaking, amazing, inspirational, and challenging, but it's a history of the world that holds a place of its own, and needs to be told to a new generation. Extremely high production values permeates throughout the series. This is an easy five star recommendation; and will bear repeated viewings, and it's a delight to see Schama revel in a story that has such personal currency and value.

Episode 5  was a good overview of how the Holocaust led to the creation of the Israeli state, and the how the conflicts with existing Palestinians have increased, particularly with the burgeoning Israeli population expanding its borders. While it touched on the views of both radical Zionists and left leaning Jews, it left the watcher pondering the current role of Israel in the Middle East.

5612291,5,B00BEYWW4I,"I've always been impressed by Simon Schama's documentaries.  His series on The History of Britain is so good I bought it on DVD and have watched it at least four times.  He has outdone himself in this series.  First, as a Jew, the pathos he brings to the program  is palpable.  You can hear and see the emotion behind what is very literally the story of his own people, even his own ancestors and parents.  Another thing that struck me is the artistic sensibility he brings to the program--you can tell that Schama is a widely respected Art Historian.  The depictions of the art works featured on the program are both beautiful and moving.  He also works very deftly with symbols, continuities, and following the threads of ideas through time as they shape the Jewish people and are shaped by them.  Listen carefully to his argument for the existence of the State of Israel--it is both simple and compelling.  As a Christian, I recommend this program very strongly to anyone who has even the slightest desire to know our Jewish brothers and sisters better.  Watching this series is five hours well spent.",1415145600,2,1104,4.697916666666667

Simon initially puts forth Freud as the basis of Jewish history and the Pesach scene showed that most there were clearly uncomfortable, did not regularly participate and did not know the Biblical history of why the Jews have Pesach in the first place.

Sad, the Jewish history is a beautiful tapestry woven by G-d to present Himself to the world as the one and only G-d and Creator of the Universe. This 'documentary' has failed, as all humanistic views do, to elevate G-d and His creation.",1413504000,8,643,4.631578947368421

5612325,5,B00BEYWW4I,"I have such respect for Simon Schama's work. This series is another achievement and testament to his usual attention to detail and insights. It was also more personal, as he said at the beginning, for this was also a history of Simon Schama's ancestry. While the long history of persecution is painful and troubling to hear about, Schama didn't focus on the details of the events as much as the emotional impact on the victims, the Jews. For me, that was very enlightening in that it wasn't about being victims but in maintaining their covenant with God no matter what. A particularly insightful moment for me was when Schama talked about Yip Harburg's music - ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime"" and ""Over the Rainbow."" Those are two such poignant anthems and, in their own way, expressions of the story of the Jews. I highly recommend this series. Yes, there are some controversial moments when viewing the more recent history of Israel and the Palestinian issues. But Schama presents those as another chapter in the history of the Jews; one that is yet to play out, and he doesn't flinch from the problems. Schama is a wonderful historian and a master storyteller. ""The Story of the Jews"" highlights both of those qualities.",1408233600,5,1223,4.773584905660377

5612330,4,B00BEYWW4I,"I am a big fan of Simon Schama, and loved his series on British history, so I was very excited to see this.  While Schama is an historian, his documentaries are presented more as a story than many other documentaries.  With 5 episodes, he's obviously not going to cover everything, so what he does is to present key points or moments or ideas or events.  Because I've already read a lot of history, I enjoy that style because he delves into things that I might not have heard of, thought about, or even been aware of.

Being a big fan, I still almost didn't make it through the first episode of this series.  I'm not sure why--it just didn't grab me, and unlike the other episodes, didn't seem to have a real story to tell.  The rest was very good and I'm glad I persevered, so if you happen to watch this and find the first episode a bit lacking, DON'T GIVE UP!

5612351,5,B00BEYWW4I,"Simon Schama's ""The Story of the Jews"" is a compelling synopsis of the history of one of the Western world's great leavening ethic minorities expressed partially as a personal and often poignant record of a persecuted people. The programs, adeptly written in the style that Dr. Schama utilizes in his documentaries, focuses on a historical topic and then refocused through the prism of an individual or group of individuals who bring the historical experience to life. It is often marvelously compelling story telling. The presentation is balanced and occasionally, not overtly, but appropriately preachy. The overall history, for any of us non-Jews, is a good complement to the classical ""Bible based"" glossed over history of Judaism, but is a history -- as it should be,  and not a ""Bible history.""  Conservative, fundamentalist Christians not interested in the Jews as a people or as individuals in a greater social population and context will be disappointed. Dr. Schama's presentation is not ""Bible stories brought to life."" Rather it is a history of persons who've maintained their separate cultural identity as social ""outsiders"" at great cost, individual and collective. The final chapter detailing the development and evolution of the modern state of Israel is well-presented and acknowledges, without condemnation the schism between liberal and conservative that polarizes Israeli society, as it does any society. There are no final solutions in the conclusion specific to the current state of Middle Eastern affairs. Ultimately, ""The Story of the Jews"" stands as eloquent historical documentation and is on pare with the superb ""A History of Britain"" written and presented by Simon Schama. It  contains substance for those of us who are students of history and presents as compellingly entertaining, a feat often difficult in the discourse on matters social, political, and historical.",1402358400,4,1896,5.398648648648648

5612354,5,B00BEYWW4I,"I first encountered the work of Simon Schama many years ago when I watched his outstanding The History of Britain.  Schama is a scholar above all things, but he is also a gifted story teller.  His History of Britain covered an amazing scope from prehistoric Britain to Winston Churchill, and it is tremendous.  I've watched it numerous times.  Schama's wit and story telling ability make him seem like a very wise friend who is conversing with you in your living room.  Based on The History of Britain I had high expectations that The Story of the Jews would be an important television event.  I wasn't disappointed.  The Story of the Jews is a personal narrative filled with deep emotion and told with extraordinary intelligence and insight.  This series is not an attempt, of course, to tell a comprehensive history of the Jewish people; such an undertaking would be beyond the scope of any television documentary.  But The Story of the Jews does cover very well a huge period of time from the origins of the Jewish people to the founding of the modern state of Israel (and beyond).  As a reasonably well-read Catholic I had a general knowledge of the Jewish people and a deep appreciation for their contributions to society in theology, philosophy, and the arts.  However, I learned a great deal and was introduced to persons that I knew little of in this documentary.  I learned a lot, but mostly I think I gained a much greater understanding of what it is to be a Jew--the tragic, beautiful, and profound tradition that informs and gives meaning to the lives of Jews.  Thanks to this passionate, personal story that Schama expertly relates, I think I gained a greater understanding of how Jews view themselves and also a better understanding of the great diversity of the Jewish people.  Schama fairly gives us the perspectives of many people with whom he does not agree but whose views he respects.  But for me personally, Schama's The Story of the Jews deepens my own faith in the God of Abraham, Moses, and David.  Above all, though, I recommend this documentary as a remarkable narrative, expertly told with an ability that many novelists would envy.  This man knows how to tell a story; watch this, and you'll see what I mean!",1401062400,17,2236,4.736434108527132

While in covering the life of the Jews in America, the energy of Jewish life, and the mark they made in cultural life and the film industry was described beautifully (although there was little mention of the contribution of Jews to science). In contrast, in Part Five, little was conveyed about life in present-day Israel. The important issues and concerns of the settler movements and the implications of separation walls, for Jews and Arabs, were presented. However, I did not find the land of Israel as I know it. Yes, soldiers carrying guns are part of life in today's Israel. However, that is not all. Where is Jewish energy and creativity? Where is Israel's thriving high tech industry and innovative agriculture? Where is Tel Aviv and other parts of the land as they are today - the cultural life, the energy?

5612360,5,B00BEYWW4I,"Schama does his usual good job of focusing on ideas not events. He is not afraid to draw conclusions from the events described.

Explains the powerful effect of the Torah and Talmud, the written words, on the entire Jewish history. The power of writing, reading, teaching, learning, arguing, remembering, connects the Jews to a past and affects the present Jewish world like no other people. Schama highlights the Hebrew writing and books as the key motor of Jewish culture.

Excellent coverage of the effect on Jewish life in Western Europe during the enlightenment. Moses Mendelssohn and his grandson, Felix, were celebrated examples of the promise of the new trust in ""Reason"". Sadly, it didn't last. Uses Wagner's attack on Meyerbeer, his mentor, to illustrate the death of that ideal. Nationalism became the goal of art and Wagner was the leading light of this new ""religion"". This was in the German world, in France, the betrayal of Dreyfus convulsed the culture for decades.

Schama is deeply moved by the sad sufferings of his people for centuries. Provides specific examples. Anyone should by touched along with him. Explains the movement of the Jews out of Spain, into Eastern Europe, the start of the pale, the immigration to America and the reason for the state of Isreal. Notes the role of the British and the UN in the start of modern Isreal.

Interesting interview with religious Zionist. Explains why Schama disagrees with his view. Covers the effect of the Jews in expelling the Arabs from their own country.

Schama explains the reasons why he is a Zionist. Develops the history of Zionism and some of the major players. Demonstrates the current tension due to the separation of Jews and Arabs.

He ends with a poignant commentary that the current narrow nationalistic basis of Isreal does not correctly reflect the real values of Jewish history. He feels the Jews need to embrace the world not separate from it.

Schama, even though a loyal Jew, is a historian and has a broad historical vista. He expresses the sense that anger and bitterness, even though having valid causes from the past, do not produce the best decisions in the present.

I enjoyed the presentation. Specific. Well organized. Accessible to all age groups. Explains the reason for the conflicts in a clear, easy to follow manner.",1399852800,36,2318,4.940874035989717

Since you, Simon Schama, have studied the scapegoating of the Jews throughout history & revealed in this documentary, that time and time again, the selection of Jews was the Propaganda Answer to a Nations Problems; I would like to ask you a question. Look at America: the pattern you described of tagging and degrading groups is happening now to Conservative Christians. Where is your voice crying in the wilderness for America to stop this: destructive, marginalizing, demeaning, diminishing, disparaging, belittling, defaming, vilification vendetta of all things Conservative Christian?

5612369,2,B00BEYWW4I,"I just watched the first episode of this series and I found it to be very dull and completely unoriginal. Mr. Schama seems to be regurgitating all the same information and history that has been available for years. There is absolutely nothing new regarding Jewish history that was discussed here.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because Mr Schama made an attempt at adding the human element of recent struggles and the enduring faith of Jewish people. It was a mere attempt though.  This documentary uninspired.  if the first episode is any indication of what the complete series is like, I will certainly not waste my time watching the rest,  let alone buy and read the book. If you're reading this review,  I would encourage you to watch the PBS Empire series 'The Kingdom of David'.  It is a well rounded and thought provoking series that is much more involved and inspiring than Mr Schamas efforts. Also, read the book called 'the Source' by James A Michener. While it is a work of fiction, it still gives an accurate portrayal of the life and times of the Jewish people from when they were a nomadic people living in caves and chronicles their struggles all the way up to the end of WW2.
Also, read your bible. In closing,  of all the programs I've watched regarding Jewish beliefs&history, Mr Schamas effort is the least interesting and informative.

5612375,4,B00BEYWW4I,"Schama has seemlessly woven history, anecdote and personal experience, to produce an account that is not history by the strict definition of the term, but is engaging and thought-provoking nonetheless. His story rests on his prodigious learning, and he tells it with confidence and erudition.

For the uninitiated and/or prejudiced, it should be a revelation to learn low well integrated the Jews were in Hellenistic and Arab societies; how Jews practiced all sorts of professions in the shtetls; and how they became involved in the Socialist and Labor movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Schama does an excellent job of trying to understand Antisemitism on the basis of a fanatical Christendom and commercial antagonisms. Early Christianity had no choice but to dissociate itself from its Jewish roots, but the teachings of its theologians (such as St. John the ""Chrysostom"" - the golden mouth) were repugnant. Medieval Christianity was a religious dictatorship. Jews were abhorred for what they were asked to do (banking) and doing it well.

Some criticisms: Schama equates the Nakba with the expulsion of the Jews from the Arab countries (the former caused the latter). I would have liked Schama to elaborate on how the U.S. has allowed/encouraged its Jews to be both American and Jewish - isn't that a paradigm that can be repeated in other societies? When speaking of the Holy Trinity, he asks : ""Not one, but two? three? How about about five for that matter?"" - being Christian, I was taken aback at first - now, I am chuckling.",1396742400,6,1540,5.01171875

8567354,5,B00BEYWW4I,"Loved it! But...

In a discourse in the 2nd episode, there are two objections to Christianity. One is that the Messiah is not central to Judaism. Well, maybe not now, but what about 2,000 years ago? Its common nowadays to have a high opinion of oneself, and so why would anyone need a savior?  The central fallacy of any religion besides Christianity is works-righteousness, that a sinner can work their way to heaven, which would leave some to boast (Ephesians 2:9).

The other, is that if Christ has come, why are there still wars, why is there injustice etc?  But despite all the over-emphasized sins that Christians commit (a tiresome feature of this documentary and so many others: makes for dramatic storylines but not good history) the world is FAR better because of Christ than what it would be without Him.  Remember that even Hitler considered himself a Christian: that doesn't make him one.  Americans fought that ""Good"" war for selfish interests but also for more noble ones.  Simon Schama has a smug and self-righteous expression here that is unworthy of PBS's presumption of non-bias: please, there's more to think about here...",1528588800,,1142,4.916666666666667

8567357,3,B00BEYWW4I,"As Schama is a British and French guy, he focuses on their history and in some cases ignores relevant history probably because it isn't relative to the story he knows. He also has a point of view that he will force. Only infrequently will he talk about outside influences, as if what is important to his story occurred in vacuum.

He is wrong on some points. The Talmud was written in Hebrew and Aramaic. Jews almost always speak the native language as well as Hebrew for the liturgy, this did not start with Mendelsohn. The Torah was famously translated to Greek. And Jews were all around the Mediteranean before the Roman conquest. There were always Jews in Palestine and the Jewish return started before Hertzl. Israel was not because of the Holocaust.

The real miracle, which has never occurred anywhere else, is that Hebrew has been resurrected from a language only used for liturgy to living language of the state
