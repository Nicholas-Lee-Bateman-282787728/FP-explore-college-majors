8632783,5,B00HHG03VG,"This review probably isn't going to help you much because I show up in the film as a mascot duck and am therefore extremely biased, but Summer League is a lovely little film you should add to your collection if you like the following: softball, Austin Texas, families, love, extremely fast waiters and parody Hulk Hogan t-shirts.

Plus, the duck is pretty cool.  Order this, love it and show it to everybody you know.",1387843200,5,417,4.621621621621622
