7795879,2,1557286639,"I new Don Harrington slightly, and always found him to be a fascinating, and funny, person to be around.  I am sure that the maker of this film thought so as well.  Unfortunately, that just does not come across here.  The film was made not long before Don died.  The person who made the film pretty much set it up to be a monologue by Don and, as interesting as the man was, this did no justice to him or the film maker.  I am sorry for that.  This could have been so much better.",1390089600,4,480,4.0
