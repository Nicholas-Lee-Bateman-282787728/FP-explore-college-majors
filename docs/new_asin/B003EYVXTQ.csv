4116104,3,B003EYVXTQ,"Though Winter's Bone builds an atmosphere of dread, self-consciousness undermines its resonance.

Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with her family in the Missouri Ozarks. Her drug dealing father, nowhere to be found, has put up their house and land as collateral for his bail. Ree vows to find him even as she cares for her younger siblings and mentally ill mother. She must face down hostile relatives to get to the truth behind her father's disappearance and, more importantly, save her home.

Winter's Bone (an adaptation of Daniel Woodrell's novel ) feels like a cultural lesson in rural poverty. Close ups accompany tense moments. A shaky camera conveys the area's rawness. Winter is captured in rare beauty, with its dead leaves, barren trees, and back roads. Scenes of everyday survival (including wood chopping and squirrel hunting) are interspersed with Ree's search for her father. Unfortunately, the filmmakers' obvious (but largely successful) attempts at authenticity come across as manipulative. The unusual filmic setting is the foreground, which makes the characters somewhat secondary.

Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Ree, but her character is difficult to identify with. A youth with troubles beyond anyone's years is not unrealistic, but Ree is nearly perfect. Unselfish, wise, understanding, tough, and above all determined, Ree is willing to sacrifice everything for her wards, without ever losing her temper with them. She has bouts of insecurity and navet, but she is more admirable than interesting.

The acting is quite good, though little liveliness is shown. Characters' pinched cheeks, chapped lips, and grim faces are realistic, but few leave an impression. In fact the only fascinating presence is Teardrop (John Hawkes), Ree's coke addicted uncle. Ambiguous and scary but loyal, Teardrop is not someone you want as an enemy.

Overly poetic dialogue jars with the rest of the film's painstaking attempts at realism. Saintly Ree gives her brother advice such as ""don't ask for what ought to be offered,"" and notes that she is a ""Dolly, bred and buttered."" Also, Ree's search gets rather repetitive as she is told by person after person to give up her quest.

Since images of barren trees and a haunting, gorgeous soundtrack evoke an ominous mood from the beginning, any darkness that lies within the community doesn't come as a shock. More surprising are the displays of genuine kindness. More astonishing still in this gothic tale would have been expressions joy or dynamism.",1282003200,13,2511,5.249376558603491

4116106,5,B003EYVXTQ,"This year's winner for the coveted Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival was a little indie called WINTER'S BONE. It finally made it to Cherrydale Cinemas this week, and I have to say that all of the hype surrounding this film is justified. It is one of the best films of the year.

It concerns a young girl, Ree Dolly, who lives deep within the Ozark Mountains. Day after day, she single-handedly takes care of her younger brother and sister, as well as her ill mother. On many occasions, she has to hunt for food in order to be able to feed her family. Ever so often, the neighbors help by giving the family leftovers from the night before. It is clear that this family is struggling, and that Ree is doing all that she can to provide.

When the sheriff shows up at her doorstep and informs her that her father, a fugitive and a crystal meth dealer, has put her house up for bail bond, she has to race against all odds to find him. Everything is at stake, and so Ree sets out on a dangerous journey in order to save her family. From the time that Ree begins her journey into darkness until the shocking finale, we are driven to the edge of our seats. Not once will you take your eyes off of the screen. There are times when you want to look away, but you can't and you won't.

The strength of this film lies in its authenticity. Most of the time, you feels as if you are watching a documentary feature, peering into the lives of these people. Everything from the performances, to the setting, to the minimalist score provides an eerie realism to the final product.

Newcomer Jennifer Lawrence plays the part of Ree Dolly, and I should tell you that this performance is going to make her a star, possibly earn her a few nominations at awards ceremonies. She shows a confidence that many actresses lack these days. I'd put her in the same category as Ellen Page. It's a magical thing when the audience forgets that they are simply watching a performance. Ree becomes real to us because of Jennifer Lawrence's abilities as an actress.

The same has to be said for the rest of the cast. I'm not sure how many of the actors had any experience prior to making this film, but they all shine in their respective roles. The direction from Debra Granik is simple and to the point. That's not to say that it lacks elegance, it only adds to the neo-realist vibe that the film sends out. The score is minimal, yet haunting. The cinematography is breathtaking. The cast and crew take us places that we have never been before to tell us a story that we will never forget.

The film was adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell.",1280880000,6,2641,4.368635437881874
4116107,4,B003EYVXTQ,"Ree has enough to deal with, even before she finds out her house is due to be taken away. She's just seventeen, and stuck running the household, with two younger siblings to feed and a catatonic mother to care for. ""Don't never ask for nothing what ought to be offered"" is the motto of this resourceful and proud young woman. She does a good job, given meager resources - but her father's been away a long time, out on bail for cooking crystal meth, and he put up the house and the land as collateral. The only thing for it is to find him, and nobody wants to help, and she comes to see that knowing can be dangerous.

For a small-scale, low-budget, independent feature, the film looks great: the desolate beauty of the landscapes, the delicate montages of the two innocent and largely unaware siblings engaged in resourceful play, the authentic settings, and the seasonal lighting. The film as a whole is richly imagined, with strong performances and an unsettling mood. The story is strong, managing to convey without exposition or voiceover the tension that exists in this region between a rich folk tradition and a stark economic necessity that has driven many of the locals to support themselves through the illegal drug trade, and the tension between familial loyalty and the need for self-preservation. At times it felt like perhaps the screenplay undercut the realism - it aimed so deliberately at economy of exposition that the characters become something like vernacular poets, implausibly tending to convey a wealth of details with a minimum of words, rather than just being reticent Still, the sense of mystery that drives Ree's exploration is sustained throughout, and kept me on the edge of my seat and caring throughout. This isn't a masterpiece, but is solid storytelling that creates the right atmosphere, and makes the most of limited resources.

Jennifer Lawrence immersed herself thoroughly in character as Ree, and her uncle ""Teardrop"" was brilliantly played by Tom Hawkes, who always seemed more vulnerable in other roles I've seen him in, such as Deadwood, but he's fierce here, and convinced me as someone you wouldn't want to mess with. What I found perhaps most fascinating was the characterization of some of the other women in the story, who serve as gatekeepers to the clan leader, Floyd. They seemed at first heartlessly vicious, but it struck me later they didn't like to be violent and saw their brutality as a kind of kindness, intended to protect. A powerful film, that stands up well to similarly powerful films about surprisingly strong individuals facing impossible circumstances in the midst of destitution, such as Trouble the Water and Undertow.",1280793600,,2685,4.951219512195122
4116108,5,B003EYVXTQ,"I'd write what it was about, but enough of the other reviews have already done that.  So...

This was, hands down, the best film I have seen in years.  The acting was superb, the story was gripping, and the scenery was beautiful.  I highly recommend this movie.  It was very real and down to earth, a nice change from all the flashy special effects stuff that is constently coming out.  I left the theater feeling refreshed and will definitely be purchasing this film when it is available on DVD.",1280620800,,496,4.51685393258427
4116109,4,B003EYVXTQ,"Imagine if you relatives, close and distant, where to settle within the proximity to each other, did drugs to the point of excess, made and sold Methamphetamine, used firearms in treating any nagging conflict between each other, and still were relatively poor. Winter's Bone contains many characters that are conflicted by the above conditions, and as far as the film lacks any observable redeemable condition. They all are family, but in their midst it would be better to be a stranger, or best never to come in contact.

Winter's Bone centers on Ree Dolly who in the absence of her father and the sickness of her mother, has to keep after her little sister and brother. Life is not easy as Ree's family lacks many of the basic necessities of life that her family and neighbors benefit from, such as food and hay for the horses. Her neighbor always pitches in to help her out with such basic needs, but isn't without her own intrusiveness about the affairs of the family. Despite the ardous conditions of life on the field, they live contently until an incident threatens to alter matters for the worst. It seems that their father who has been arrested multiple times for his illegal production and utilizing of Methamphetamine has put the house on bail and failed to appear for his hearing. If the family does not find him in time, they will lose their property. Ree sets out to find her father before they are thrown out of their house; a task she must be complete in less than a week.

Finding her father should not be the issue as the people he associates himself are fellow family members, but these people are not willing to reveal anything as it may be used against them in a legal context. Their unwillingness infuriates Ree as these are not only the only sources she can trace toward her father, but also because many of these people are close relatives of her father, such as Teardrop who is his brother. The family members are so coldly removed from each other that Ree must remember them that they are family, and that this must count for some level of trust. The Dolly family are so emotionally distant that a distasteful or insulting act by one member could entice close relatives to physically harm him. Everyone of may have inherited the surname, but their safety lies in their actions. This families safety and freedom does not lie in the hand of the Police, considering the amount of illegal activities they commit, but in the hands of the more powerful members of the family. No one dares to cross paths with the ""Chief"" of the Dolly family, as his large army of minions has enough power to crush any member of the family that he wishes. The Dolly family is not unlike the Mafia where one person rules, the Don, and the inferior men are continuously trying to ascend in rank. Unlike the Mob , however, a  large majority of the Dolly family are forever condemned to remain inferior. The treatment of the woman is deplorable as it is implied that their only concerns should be within the kitchen and the bedroom.

Jeniffer Lawrence's portrayal of Ree is central to the film's success as her presence makes the title character seem so empowered and determined to solve this mystery. She stares in the camera with such confidence that the idea that she has raised herself and her siblings seems convincing; her demeanor also suggests that her mother's sickness is nothing new but it has been an ongoing condition. Lawrence is especially brilliant in some  very masculine moments of the film, such as a scene involving skinning of squirrels and teaching her siblings in using a rifle. Much credit is also due to Director/screenwriter Debra Granik who shows Ree's inability to solve this case on her alone, and eventual surrender in the face of all the hardship that the Police and her family hurl in her direction. Granik has no intent to show Ree as a cowardly character, rather suggesting that without her family's help she is quite helpless and must concede defeat.

This is a deftly created product where the insubstantial plot succeeds in seeming much more complex than it turns out to be. Winter's Bone owes its success to its approach which familiarizes the audience with few admirable characters who trying to accomplish this not so easy task among the numerous villainous family members who are willing to do anything to prevent Ree from finding her father. The film is so captivating in its unique mood and atmosphere that its virtually nonexistent plot is only recognized near the conclusion. As unbelievably odd and unlikely as the ending of the film may be, its bittersweet nature is as Dolly as Granik could have achieved.",1278720000,33,4651,4.721674876847291
4116110,5,B003EYVXTQ,"The theme of innocence unprotected, fighting for its life, is one of the oldest and most potent in fiction. Debra Granik's film ""Winter's Bone,"" based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a bleak, unforgettable folk tale about a teenage girl whose struggle for survival takes her to dark places few people ever have the misfortune to see.

Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), a 17-yer-old girl in the Missouri Ozarks, has dropped out of school to care for her younger siblings and her severely depressed, catatonic mother. Deserted by her methamphetamine-cooking father Jessup, Ree manages to keep the family going until the day the sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) shows up at their cabin. Jessup has skipped bail, the sheriff tells her, and he put up the cabin as surety. Jessup has one week to show up in court, or the cabin is forfeit.

""Winter's Bone"" is the story of Ree's desperate search for her father to prevent her family from being thrown out into the woods. This search, without going into plot points, costs her dearly. The Ozarks are already a place where people learn early to mind their business and not to go snooping in other peoples'. Add meth dealing to the picture, and the situation turns deadly. Ree finds scant sympathy from her neighbors and even her own extended family. Her scary Uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) makes it excruciatingly plain that her questions are unwelcome. Yet Teardrop's reaction is mild compared with that of the even scarier people he works for. ""We warned you,"" Merab (Dale Dickey), wife of the local meth boss, tells Ree. ""Why didn't you listen?""

""Winter's Bone"" is a masterful film, seamlessly mixing delicate lyricism and white-knuckle suspense. The acting is superb down to the smallest bit part. Nineteen-year-old Jennifer Lawrence, in her first starring role, scarcely seems to be acting; she really seems to be this frail girl, armed only with courage and a fierce love of her family, facing down monsters. Blessed with an uncommonly smart, poignant music score from a number of Ozarks musicians, ""Winter's Bone"" is the best film so far this year, and it seems unlikely that any film will exceed it. It has already won major prizes at the Sundance and Berlin film festivals; here's hoping it can add an Oscar or two to the tally.",1278028800,2,2271,4.8782383419689115
4116111,5,B003EYVXTQ,"As crack cocaine is to inner cities and alcohol is to Indian reservations, so methamphetamine is devastating rural white communities across the United States. WINTER'S BONE, set in the remote Ozark Mountains, hauntingly depicts this plague. The story focuses on 17-year-old Ree Dolly, whose father has disappeared after putting up the family home as bail collateral. Unless she can find him, Ree and her younger brother and sister will be without a roof over their heads.

Ree's father is a ""cooker"" and her mother has been driven into a catatonic state. Ree is on her own in the hostile, clannish, and male-dominated community where she stumbles from trailer to trailer in her frantic search. Crank's ravages are everywhere, in the gaunt and grim faces, the harsh and sudden violence, the cruelty and hopelessness. Her father's only brother, Teardrop (flawlessly played by John Hawkes), holds a spoonful of the white powder out to her and asks, ""Gotten the taste for it yet?"" ""Not yet,"" she recoils.

Aside from the down-home soundtrack, Winter's Bone is not easy to watch. Its gritty realism never lets up. The characters look like they climbed from Dorothea Lange's Depression and Dust Bowl images, only with a touch of meth-induced paranoia added to the hunger and despair. The dialogue is sparse, and not once in 100 minutes do we hear laughter or feel much hope for Ree's future. What makes it all bearable is the strength and determination of Ree, movingly played by 19-year-old Jennifer Lawrence.

Winter's Bone is winning awards and earning rave reviews. The acclaim is well deserved. To achieve authenticity, director and co-writer Debra Granik and her team spent two years immersing themselves in the local community. Ree's younger sister is even played by a child who lives in the main house in which the movie is set. The film's power makes me want to see Granik's 2005 debut film, ""Down to the Bone,"" another award winner focused on drug addiction and featuring a strong female lead.

Postscript #2: To gain a critical understanding of the meth plague in rural communities of the U.S., I highly recommend Nick Reding's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Methland-The-Death-and-Life-of-an-American-Small-Town/dp/B00BV2N28S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Methland: The Death and Life of an American Small Town</a>. It convincingly links the meth epidemic to global changes, including the pharmaceutical industry and the corporatization of food.",1277164800,403,2660,5.446601941747573
4116112,5,B003EYVXTQ,"This 2010 Sundance Film Festival award winner is the story of Ree, a courageous 17-year old young woman in rural Missouri.  She cares for her young brother and sister as well as her mentally absent mother under extremely stressful conditions.  Sometimes the neighbors help out but the family lives in poverty.  The father cooks methamphetamine and is out of jail on bond.  But he has disappeared, and if Ree doesn't find him, the family property will be confiscated.  This is a horrible situation for anyone to find themselves in, but Ree, played by newcomer Jennifer Lawrence, has the kind of inner strength that makes her confront all the forces that try to hinder her search.

John Hawkes is cast has her father's brother and he seems to know more than he is letting her know.  And her other kinfolk are close-mouthed and aggressive.  She is even beaten up by some of them.  But her determination in the face of seemingly impossible odds make her the kind of heroine to be admired.

There's constant tension in this film and some rather gruesome details.  But how it all plays out is positive and believable and made me want to applaud this very special heroine.  This is truly a worthwhile film even though it depicts a sad and difficult way of life.  Film aficionados will love it.",1277078400,3,1286,4.6875
4116113,5,B003EYVXTQ,"Adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, WINTER'S BONE immediately sparked comparisons to last year's Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker.  Both films received limited runtime in theaters.  But I must say this is by far the superior movie in just about every aspect imaginable, unless you count overwrought machoism, slanted anti-war sentiments, and explosions as a category.  Don't get me wrong, The Hurt Locker was a decent film for what it was.  But it won't leave the kind of lasting impression like this story will.

When you hear the word ""backwoods"", you might get the immediate impression of inbred, buck-toothed hillbillies wearing overalls and drinking moonshine.  This story doesn't succumb to exploiting certain exaggerated stereotypes just to grab your attention.  But these characters are definitely a little rough around the edges, to say the least.

Filmed in the Ozarks of Missouri, this is a simple but riveting dramatic tale about family, danger, and perseverance.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17-year-old girl forced to grow up way too fast.  With her mother desperately ailing and her father somewhere hiding from the law, she struggles to support her younger brother and sister.  To make matters worse, a bail bondsman notifies her that her dad put up their home as his bail bond, then skipped out on court.  In order to track her father down, Ree is forced to enter a seedy, violent realm of paranoid drug pushers and users.  Many of them happen to be distant family members.  Family ties or not, none of them are too anxious to help her out.  The risks and desperation mount as she inches closer to the truth.

The best part of this film is the character development and the acting.  It is so refreshing to see the young cast perform their roles with such controlled precision.  Especially Lawrence.  She puts many established Hollywood actors to shame here, I can't wait to see more of her work.

WINTER'S BONE is slow paced, and might not appeal to many casual movie goers.  But it does have some moments of heightened tension that will leave you holding your breath.  It explores a certain drug culture and meager lifestyle that is rarely touched upon in movies.  Plus it makes some poignant, thought-provoking points about family devotion and the human spirit.

It also was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.  I doubt there will be a better film than this all year.  Brilliant filmmaking.",1276992000,148,2477,4.908433734939759

I grew up in a rural part of Missouri (not the Ozarks) as a kid in the '60s.  The depiction of so-called 'poor' people in this movie (compared to typical tv shows set in suburban areas) is accurate, in that the kids still have toys, clothes, food, live in decent housing, etc., it's just that there are junk cars standing around, the houses and yards are a mess, etc.

What is mildly offensive to me is the depiction of 80%+ of the populace of that area as being meth-heads.  I visit the Ozarks and the people I know that live there are welders, contractors, mechanics, and the like who do NOT deal in or use drugs.

The meager life imposed by drastic poverty especially among children.  The set really shows the impoverished  rural mountains and the living conditions, hopelessness and despair  You can really relate to the will to survive no matter what and keeping the family together and intact.  The plot was complex and interesting with many turns and subplots.  Really kept us interested.  Excellent character development.  The children, like all children, are playing different ways and having fun doing things without realizing that they are very disadvantaged.  Very much a gripping drama.  Amazingly well done.

4116259,5,B003EYVXTQ,"I knew this film was well-received by critics but I resisted watching it because it seemed too depressing. Being a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, I decided to finally watch it. For anyone who truly appreciates art or has experienced the reality of poverty-stricken areas in the mid-east United States, you will be glad you saw this. It wasn't depressing to me at all. The violence was true to the situation, not put there for shock value. To me, that aspect was minimal; I was surprised by how much the story is filled with love. The relationships within Ree's immediate family are very gentle, and even before the crisis descends, she clearly shows her heart as she raises her siblings (not only feeding and teaching them life skills, but sacrificing her own education so they can have theirs). The extended family is shockingly rough, but they do have their code of honor and eventually respond to Ree's stubborn courage.

As the (downright scary) plot unfolds, it also conveys a much larger story about how people live with both desperation and kindness. Having lived and interacted with some of this world, I can attest to the accuracy of this portrayal -- it's a little window into the absolute reality of some Americans. The way the plot is interwoven with the portrait of Ree's day-to-day life is stunningly well done. If you're willing to take it all in, the story being told and the artistry of the film together pack a breathtaking punch.

We all know that the threads of life and death are closely bound, but some of us have experienced this more than others. (I felt that the understated relationship between the characters and their animals illustrated that beautifully as well.) Most of us do what we have to, and uneducated does not mean stupid. If you've had difficulties in your life or have had to sacrifice in order to survive, I think you'll feel uplifted by this film. Some stark reality, yes -- but also raw courage and love.

For the record, Lawrence's performance deserves every accolade it has received. Stoic and emotional at the same time, she carries the weight of the film with uncanny skill.",1497398400,4,2116,4.760217983651226

That goes for most of the other actors - I was wondering if they just did a casting call in the mountains because their dialect, timing, and shuffled speech patterns were so genuine. John Hawkes also never disappoints.  The story and setting are bleak to be sure. It does show the litter, the depression, the dirty, hidden lives but that is sadly how some in the Ozarks are forced to live. It's a key component of the story - a girl trapped by her circumstances and generations of kin going nowhere but to their meth labs for money to feed themselves. It's tragic and eye opening to see people in the US living in poverty laden clans like this. Bleak and depressing, but so are their lives.  Excellent movie.",1496016000,,907,4.490909090909091

My dad shot squirrels to eat, as well. Maybe, that is supposed to be sad. Years ago, everyone had to kill their food.... Some reviewers said the characters are living in poverty? However, this is not poverty to me. The six year old has big expensive toys. They have a nice place to live, clothes, food, land etc. I grew up much much poorer. I have also been to other countries where children eat termites off the ground, have no home and are barely clothed. They sleep on the ground with bugs crawling all over them. On another note, Jennifer Lawrence is great. The other actors were pretty good. The movie was slow to me, but it kept my interest. Others have said they couldn't follow the story.

Having experienced some of these type of folks first hand it is depressing they want to live this way. Groomed from birth to hate, to revile government, to handle things their way and anyone else be damned, to shun or even kill outsiders asking too many questions, these type of people forget one thing, they do the very same thing to others, not them, that they detest. Hypocrites of the highest caliber. Do as I say, not as I do, or we will kill you.

They want to be their own little country but they do not want to give validation to those that continue to let them live their miserable live this way. These people in reality commit the same crimes they rail against and do no think for one moment they may be the ones that are wrong. That is how they were raised and that is how they are bred to think, they and their ways are right, everyone else is wrong and needs to stay away.

I could write a thesis on why these people do what they do. It is a waste, like any Human left to themselves, isolated, they will regress to the basic needs and laws of self governing and their style of justice and punishment. They do not want to accept the world is moving on without them and when that world visits them, they hate it.

These people think they are bad ass and can cause all sorts of trouble and repel anyone that approaches their tiny little world and that is sad. They have no clue what the real world, and I use the term real world verse their own little antiseptic world they create and live in, no clue at all to the other countries wanting to destroy western culture and their way of life too.

They know they do wrong by the law, laws they do not agree with and would rather live in anarchy and their own brand of whats right and they kill because they know they are wrong or they wouldn't do it. Like any sub species they are fiercely loyal to each other, administer justice and punishment per their twisted code to each other and administer punishment to any outsider foolish enough to ask the wrong thing or administer modern law.

They are right in every instance and everyone else is wrong. That is their greatest fault, their greatest sin, and why they will always be outcasts. Their is nothing uplifting about a bunch of out of control Humans regressing to basic instincts. You want uplifting then research the the ones that left and journeyed to make something of their lives in the modern world and left that tiny little world of hate and anarchy behind.

This movie could have been much shorter. They simply filmed an ant colony attacking and killing a grasshopper and you would have gotten the very same theme. Jennifer Lawrence could have voiced one of the ants.",1494806400,2,2935,4.364468864468864

Huge drug issues....where they get the money for it I don't know but they have the narcotics issues.  Huge social implications from the rampant drug use, rampant drinking and abject poverty.  This movie does a very good job of portraying the hopelessness of the situation although some of the ""toys"" the kids have are quite expensive and clean for this type of poverty.  Jennifer Lawrence does a great job portraying a character seeking her father who is missing and deeply involved in the drug trade of that community.

Oh, the film was done very well, and the actors performed flawlessly, but the subject matter is so depressing and/or disgusting as to make viewing it in one sitting a challenge. To think that people have so little self respect and such disdain for the land that they occupy, and that little kids are so deprived because of the selfishness and laziness of their elders in what is considered to be a modern, evolved society and that they choose to perpetuate the squalid conditions that they have created and become accustomed to, is unconscionable. But then, the alternative is to have the politicos and bureaucrats intervene, (regardless of political stripe) to ""make things all better.""  Talk about a quandary.  I would recommend experiencing this, but you might consider infusing yourself with copious amounts of alcohol or taking 10-20 mg. of Valium before such an undertaking.  This is a dark, dark film.

I feel the writers could have shown their hardship in a different way, instead of killing animals, say struggling with measly food stamps or those terrible bags of horrible food that schools send home with the kids.  Working hard in a garden in the summer and canning food for the winter would get the point across that food was scarce and the kids had to work hard and find a way to survive.

4116373,2,B003EYVXTQ,"I have to be honest and go against the grain on this one. Everyone seems to be praising this movie, but it just didn't move me. If you want to see a ""lonely small town desperation"" movie, I'd suggest ""Boys Don't Cry."" That seemed to nail the desolation and loneliness of a small town very well. That movie was a little more slick because it had a bigger budget, and honestly, a more talented director. There were just scenes and elements in this movie where it felt like it was going to go bigger style wise, but it was limited by a small budget. There were things, actually many things that just didn't seem to have the impact and effect they were supposed to have because this sort of felt like a ""B""movie.

I am really sorry to say that, and this movie had a good, strong foundation underneath it. The desperation of the backcountry Ozarks is a really interesting place to start, but this movie failed for many of the same reasons as ""Out of the Furnace,"" and actually felt like that movie in most places. There is just this flat energy to many movies if they don't have a big enough budget and they aren't slick enough. I am really sorry to say all of this, but it's true.

I guess I should also address the lead actress, who is Jennifer Lawrence, no less, and someone who people are really raving about in this role. Sorry to say, but I don't really get the fanfare for her, either. She was passably good in this movie, but far from great. She sort of passed all the way through this movie just being kind of stone faced, but also sort of looking like she might burst out laughing in a few scenes. It is disappointing, because I understand that this is the movie that started all of the buzz around her career, and people made me expect great things out of her performance. For that, she would have needed to dig deeper and show some real gritty emotion and vulnerability. I can't say that I saw either of those things. Jennifer Lawrence is indeed a solidly good actress, but I just don't feel that we saw any of that in this movie. This movie also came off feeling somewhat 2 dimensional and cheap, and for that reason, it didn't pop. I have to give this 1.5 - 2 stars.",1482883200,2,2175,4.315403422982885

I was particularly interested in Jennifer Lawrence and her earlier career. I'm always amazed at the ""natural"" talent of young actors and actresses - ""before"" they ""make it.""  Often their choice of roles they play are different than when famous - when made more towards ""marketing"" than
perhaps resonating with the characters they play. In Winters Bone, you see just how good Jennifer Lawrence really is. The movie is harsh. The story setting a place none of us would want to be. It really questions the devotion to ""family,"" when everything is crashing down, and there seems there's no way out. When being ""tough"" is a way of life, Jennifer's character takes it to a whole other level. At least rent it. You may come back like I did and buy it.

No doubt such things are possible, but this film makes Deliverance look like a tea party.  So I was surprised when local media got so excited by it.  Hardly a recommendation to move to the Ozarks!  The film (and I assume the book as well) suggests a dark and criminal element bound by family honor that pervades the countryside. It would have been more realistic, in my view, if this had been put into a context of a generally peaceful, sane and friendly society where bad people sometimes make bad things happen.

4116390,5,B003EYVXTQ,"Winter's Bone is why people know who Jennifer Lawrence is. This was the Oscar performance, she won the Oscar for 'Silver Lining Playbook' but 'Winter's Bone' was the movie of a lifetime. She will always be defined by that movie, just like Gregory Peck will always be defined by the movie 'To Kill a Mocking Bird'. Yes I am saying it is that kind of defining role and movie. This movie takes us to a place and emotion most of us will never experience. The grinding generational poverty, passed form one generation to another and will continue into the future. The mental trap as metaphorically shown by the mother locked in that life unable to push back against it. Jennifer Lawrence shows a you woman pushing against her future. When they cast 'Hunger Games' the producers looked at this movie and cast her on the spot. ""Winter's Bone' is the modern day back story to 'Hunger Games'. The same place, same trapped situation between the characters, overcoming the horror of generational poverty and the inability to find a way out.

Why did they want to tell this story It's not entertainment. It's not uplifting. It's bleak. And I guess if you are sitting around your comfortable existence thinking man, this is so dull I might die of boredom, you may want to put things into perspective by giving Winter's Bone a shot. It really is good. Bleak as hell, but good.
To give you an idea of how I felt when it was over I immediately went over to youtube and watched Jennifer Lawrence accepting her Oscar for best actress in a different film.

4116433,4,B003EYVXTQ,"While a lot of the big-budgeted studio films funded by Hollywood show us fantasies about the American experience, ""Winter's Bone"" does not. It's a gritty and disturbing look at rural America in the Ozarks, the mountainous, foothill and wooded region between the Appalachians to the east and the Rocky Mountains to the West. This is definitely hillbilly country where people listen to blue-grass music, hunt wild game for food, and live in simple houses and drive cheap cars and trucks. They also have strange intertwined relationships. Some of them engage in behavior which would make the upper-crust of mainstream America cringe, but they don't snitch on each other because this would be considered disloyal to their community. This self-contained bubble is the setting of ""Winter's Bone"".

Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in her first acclaimed performance prior to the ""Hunger Games"") is a 17-year-old forced by circumstance to be the care-giver of her siblings, 12-year-old Sonny and 6-year-old of Ashlee. Ree Dolly has to be parent, head-of-household and bread-winner for her family. Their mother is sick in the head, unable to deal with family problems, and their father Jessup is long-gone. He's been accused of being a methamphetamine (""crystal meth"") ""cooker"", and he put up the family's small log cabin as bond collateral after he was arrested, and he has a pending court date. The trouble is, no one knows where he is, and the family could lose the house if he doesn't appear in court.

On top of her other duties as the current head-of-household of her family, Ree has to find the whereabouts of her father. She then goes around her ""neighbors"" who know her family, some of them part of meth production and dealing, asking what happened to her father. These members of this community, if community it can be called, are all tight-lipped about her father, all claiming they either don't know what happened to him or they know and yet have no intention of letting her or anyone else know the fate of her father.

The only adult member of her extended family who is functioning reasonably well is her uncle Teardrop, her father's brother. We get the sense that he also may have cooked meth. He makes up a story about what happened to him with some physical evidence, but she doesn't buy it. Early in the film, Ree Dolly tried to speak with the ""godfather"" of the locals, Thump Milton (Ronnie Hall), who probably oversees much of the meth production and dealing, but she's turned away. Then she realizes she may have crossed some kind of unknown line when she returns to the Milton residence only to be taken into their barn by force.

This is quite an interesting yet not exactly entertaining film. Jennifer Lawrence shows early on why she became an A-list actress with an Academy-Award nominated performance. The story is entirely from her point of view, and her acting is as compelling as the natural landscape. Aside from the grim but compelling storyline, one aspect should be celebrated: this film has some of the most amazing shots of the Ozarks region I've ever seen in a narrative film, probably the best since ""Deliverance"" which takes place in the neighboring Appalachians. The broken-down cars and unkempt houses are certainly not sites for sore eyes, however, the landscapes of trees and foothills, especially during the twilight hours when a soft mist coats the scenery are breath-taking. Maybe the point of the story, which is not exactly touchy-feely, is that these people live in a beautiful part of America and yet live very dark and shabby lives. If their lives could improve and be closer to the beauty which surrounds them, maybe their lives could be more beautiful too.",1463184000,,3696,4.9088

I don't recommend this for younger children due to content, no matter how much they admire Jennifer. There is some content, subject material and scenes that I wouldn't let my children watch. It is a great story otherwise and gives a different perspective. I like movies that show different issues and perspectives, some we may not even be aware of in suburbia. *Spoiler Alert* I had great sympathy for her character and the burdens she had to carry at such a young age, things some of us in ""suburbia"" may not even think of a modern teenager having to deal with as we taxi our kids around to school, extra curricular stuff, set up play dates and think about our vacations.

The brutality of human beings is on full display here.  But there were some holes in the plot that left me either second guessing or not following and understanding certain aspects of the plot.  While it is not a terrible movie it is not what I would call riveting either.  Interestingly subdued might fit this better.  I guess I was expecting to have more of the back story filled in and that never happened.  Could be that additional viewings might render a slightly higher rating.  My initial response is that it is a good, just not a great movie!  The only other thing that was a bit of a turn off was the pacing.  Almost too slow.

I thought there were so many plot twists and unexpected turns to the story that I found it intriguing and rich. Like many have said, the sense of atmosphere and depiction of this world in the Ozaeks was astounding. Granted, I am not from there so I can't say it is authentic in every detail, but I definitely felt that I was immersed in a very believable, if frightening, reality.

4116511,4,B003EYVXTQ,"I really enjoyed this film, and to be candid, reading the book made this film even richer for me.

Jennifer Lawrence, before she became famous - the glamorous Katniss, is riveting here.  She invested wholeheartedly.  Wearing lumpy clothes and her plain face bare of makeup (sorry but I can see beyond the exterior and she is a nice-looking, but plain girl; there was no semblance of prettiness).  She is young, but she cares for her siblings and her mother, and she is not afraid.  Confronted with a terrible situation, she holds her ground - she cannot falter, and she does what she can.  She fights hard, guiding her younger siblings, giving her mother what comfort she can, but almost cold when hunting down her fugitive father.

She confronts those bigger and older than her, and she is not afraid.

This is Jennifer Lawrence's film.  Her performance made the film.

But I also loved the atmosphere, this very strange place, where eating squirrels was normal, where drug use was common, and where there were powerful protective clans.

This is a beautiful captivating film.  And I did enjoy it.  But I do believe the book and film go hand and hand, to the extent where you can't enjoy one without the other.",1447804800,,1211,4.70952380952381

4116535,3,B003EYVXTQ,"Released in 2010, Winters Bone stars Jennifer Lawrence as Ree Dolly, a 17 year-old in the Ozarks of southern Missouri whos about to lose the family homestead because her father jumped bail. The story revolves around her desperate search for her dad and the mysterious silence she gets. John Hawkes plays her Uncle Teardrop.

One reviewer fittingly said There is Barely a Smile in this Study of the Backwoods with its Hypocrisy of Clannish Detachment while another succinctly summed it up as Hillbilly Corleone Family. Thats Winters Bone in a nutshell, an independent film hailed by critics everywhere. Its a grim, desperate rural mountains drama. While the storys one-dimensionally bleak and filled with mumbling ambiguities, I appreciate the film because it provides a window into illegal methamphetamine manufacturing in rural communities, the drug version of moonshine. I also liked how unpredictable certain parts were, like the tense stand-off with the Sheriff and the macabre chainsaw sequence. My wife, however, thought it was a bore because it was TOO one-dimensional and bleak. Needless to say, if you need cheering up, avoid ""Winter's Bone"" like the plague.

This was supposedly Jennifers break-out movie. While I give it a marginal thumbs-up, its overrated IMHO. An independent movie with the same tone and more redeeming qualities is 2008s Frozen River.

The movie runs 100 minutes and was shot in Taney County and Christian County in southern Missouri not far from the border of Arkansas.

4116561,5,B003EYVXTQ,"It's a great movie, but a tough one. Jennifer Lawrence is a star, albeit one with few speaking lines. In her back-woods town in the Ozarks (never mentioned by name), there's a law that's greater than the law, and that's family (which, pretty much everyone is, to a certain degree).

Ree's family is just barely getting by - her father is notably absent, caught up in the local meth trade, and her mother is catatonic - a result of an event even the bravest of characters seem unable or unwilling to speak of. Left to fend for herself, her own mother, and her two much-younger siblings, she's become a resourceful second mother - but she's living off the kindness of her neighbors.

When the local sheriff tells her her father's skipped out on court date and put up their house as collateral, she's sent though a long convoluted chain of family ties to try to find him - or what's left of him.

At its heart, this is a detective story, but it cleverly avoids film noir references even as it uses a similar structure. If you loved Brick, this is practically the same movie, but quieter, with a lot more character and a lot more on the line.",1437004800,10,1138,4.435406698564593

4116601,5,B003EYVXTQ,"Background : : This drama is all Jennifer Lawrence. Her character is teen girl from the hills where every other family is  related either  by blood or marriage (not quite as inbreed as in Deliverance but there is a banjo) . The main source of income in this region is the production of crank. A very potent illegal drug which is dangerous to ""cook"".Most of the families are involved either directly or  indirectly in its manufacturing  and dispensing. Jennifer L. character is a member of such a family. She herself is not involved in this activity. Her father has disappeared, her mother is mentally disabled and there are two younger siblings to be cared for. Her only solution is to find her father before the family homestead is confiscated by the bail bondsman. To find her father she has to ask questions . In this community the wrong questions are very dangerous to one health.
The story :: No spoilers ...promise.
How is this young (17 ish) girl going to ask questions about her dad from people that are determined not to answer so as not to bring any attention to themselves? How is this young girl literally going to keep her family alive?
Her survival skills are inspirational. She will keep this family together. She will keep the house and land if she can find her father. It seems to be an impossible situation . What she has to do and how to do it seem overwhelming. Jennifer L.  Is masterful at portraying this characters pressure cooker situation. Its truly intense. How she attacks the problems at hand without panic and with  pure determination is very convincing.  She knows if she panics it will all fall apart. Remember there is a bail bondsman ready to confiscate the property, two younger siblings who need attention and a mother who has ""lost it"". Not to mention a missing dad who is the key in preventing the collapse of this house of cards if he can be found. To add to this drama she can not violate the code of this community.  Questions of the wrong sort will bring catastrophe to her and her family. There are eyes on these people all the time. She could be trouble even if she is kin.
Jennifer Lawrence in one of her earliest performances gives us this character. She makes us want to root for her. She is kind and a loving sister and daughter .You wonder how she can overcome this stacked deck.
This is a terrific film of determination, familial love and loyality.
The main theme of solving the mystery to her fathers absence keeps us guessing throughout the film. Along comes John Hawkes (the Perfect Storm) as her uncle .Is he a knight in shining armour to lend assistance or is he just a diversion . It is his brother that is missing. Can he help or is his loyality elsewhere?
They both give such wonderful performances. This is a film you will watch many times. They both give very engrossing performances. The supporting cast looks,acts and performs as if they are locals to this region. This adds great flavor and realism to the film and its locale. They are a beautiful finishing touch to the movie.
You really don't need computer generated grahics and spectacular special affects to have a fine film. Acting and a good script with the right location is more than enough for an exciting and engrossing film. Its all here.
There is incredible talent in this young actress (you can omit the Hunger Games if you wish).
It took me few double takes and a "" are you kidding me "" in recognizing her in American Hustle. Truly an amazing transformation.  She played this character over the top and it was delightful to watch her at work. Almost as much as I did in Winters Bone.",1431907200,,3609,4.548536209553158

4116659,4,B003EYVXTQ,"""Winters Bone"" starts with a side view of a shanty house at the edge of a field on a hill, surrounded by forests. A rendition of ""The Missouri Waltz"" is being played in the background. It was filmed on location in Christian ad Taney counties in Missouri, but could have easily been any mountain county in Appalachia, which is where I grew up. The people and the story could have been from there as well. Its not often when I see a movie that completely nails the feeling, culture and personality of mountain country. Sometimes they are portrayed condescendingly or just the opposite, glorifyied. ""Winter's Bone"" speaks to the challenges of a society that can be plagued with drug abuse, poverty, bigotry and violence. It doesn't show these violations in a manner that passes judgement on them, but often gives each a backing of origin and in the process weaves an intricate fabric showing how each becomes tangled up in the other causing a knot that can be difficult to unravel.

Its under these circumstance that the young Jennifer Lawrence is challenged with portraying Ree, an older sister with dreams of order under the structure of military service while burdened with two younger siblings, a mentally withdrawn mother and a non-present father being sought by the law. Lawrence convincingly shows us how to be tough enough to protect her siblings, scared enough to know she's only seventeen and forced into an adult world, and brave enough to withstand it's cruelty. Undoubtedly it was the movie that made anyone believe she could easily be Catness in the Hunger Games, a role that has a tenth of the tenacity as that of Ree.

With a capable crew, the screenplay of ""Winter's Bone"" enables many strong performers a chance to show themselves like many have never seen them. John Hawkes is able to portray the uncle Teardrop, a complicated character with a believable mixture of skeletons and kindness. Hawkes, who is often plays roles like the scrawny and goofy sidekick to the equally goofy Hurley in LOST portrays a very believable Teardrop. Garret Dillahunt is a cowardly sheriff, Dale Dickey a worn down but loyal wife that's not afraid to get her hands dirty, and we even get a surprising cameo from the lovely Sheryl Lee, who you may remember as Laura Palmer from Twin Peaks.

From the first scene and through each Ulysses-like journey that Ree makes to each neighbor in walking distance ""Winter's Bone"" carries you through a landscape full of symbolism, empathy and humanity. It transfers the tension that poor Ree lives every day and as a result helps you feel every disastrous moment along with the occasional and briefly sunny rays of hope. It's not a movie to miss.",1425168000,,2680,4.821739130434783

This movie is proof that crime and unsavory characters really do exist in the backwoods - a place where many seek false security.  I say - a place where nobody can hear you scream!  I would highly recommend this movie - it is dark, but it needs to be.  I am from Missouri and the music was very nice.  I don't know anyone who has seen this movie who wasn't moved by it.

They really did a great job with this film-very real-casting was superb-I think they followed thebook really well .

The family is going to lose the house because Dad jumped bail. Then, be prepared to be thoroughly saturated with the theme that there is a major Meth Problem in Rural America. That's about the long and short of it. There's really nothing else to this movie, no enduring theme, nothing that makes this movie memorable at all.

4116701,5,B003EYVXTQ,"I read Daniel Woodrell's WINTER'S BONE when it was first published in 2006 and recognized it as a truly special story set in the low-life world of meth-cooking for which the Ozarks and Appalachians have become increasingly characterized. Soon thereafter a whole genre of copy-cat books was spawned with similar movie-making violence with a literary bent. While I deplore the entire genre and its skewed and unjustified effect on these mountain regions, I do appreciate some of these exemplary novels, this one best of all.

So, last night I came across the WINTER'S BONE film made from Woodrell's book and stayed up way past my bedtime to watch it --- and I ended up watching it twice. It was that good. Woodrell's authentic language of the book came through in the film so clearly, so beautifully, and the landscape and settings were also authentic for the sub-culture of the story. Some scenes especially were absolutely stunning, and the young girl (Jennifer Lawrence) who played the main character Ree Dolly was phenomenal.

Highly recommended, both book and film, even if you are not a fan of the genre.",1420934400,,1108,4.919786096256685

I didn't even find Jennifer Lawrence to be that good. Anyone could have said those idiotic lines. Just an asinine bore overall. Wish I could get my $1.99 and 100 minutes back.",1420761600,6,475,4.95

4116829,1,B003EYVXTQ,"I cant believe this story won best picture and screenplay at Sundance and was nominated for some Academy Awards!

In the land of crazy I imagine this story could be deemed entertaining and a thriller.

In the land of humans raised without being terrorized by family members or daily hunger or living in poverty, I guess it might be just a story to pass the time.

In the land of promoting major dysfunctional, crippling family relationships as normal, this story might be presented as heroic, but I found it shocking, appalling and disgusting!

To give you a synopsis (spoiler alert) this is a story about family or clan life in the Ozarks, focusing on one particular family where the 17yr. old daughter is left raising her 2 younger siblings and taking care of her mother, who has mentally checked out of the crazy situation. The father a drug user and meth producer has jumped bail thus leaving their home and property in jeopardy. So the daughter sets out to find him since shes getting no help from her uncle or other relatives. (though a neighbor gives the family food from time to time).

Her journey is where the grotesqueness of the family story escalates. Her uncle won't help because he thinks her dad snitched on other clan meth producers ~ a big no no in the familys long standing, unchallenged, putrid code of loyalty and silence. The daughter herself is disgusted by her dads snitching, but continues to search for him so they won't lose the house and property. She goes to the head of the clan, her grandpa, who can only be approached and spoken to when he wants to be approached and women up there only speak when given permission, they know their place. They are trained from the time they're little by grown women who follow blindly and ignorantly. The girl ignores the grandpas wife who threatens her. The girl is insistent in talking to him anyway,  so the wife offers to find out what she can. The wife passes on the information from the grandpa and the girl sets off in that direction. She ignores the burnt out meth lab shack that other family members try to say her dad blew up in. When she tries to confront her grandpa again, he is outraged, ignores her, but gets his women goons to beat the girl horribly, knocking teeth out, breaking ribs, etc. while the men stand around proudly watching their crazy women train the girl. The girls uncle goes to rescue her and takes her home ~ not the hospital ~ after all shes a clan member and tough and could take it, even puts knocked out teeth in a glass of water.

Now because other clan members are gossiping about the horrible way the women treated the girl, they're embarrassed into helping her and take her to the lake her fathers body was dropped into. Thinking ahead, the wife of the grandpa brings along a chain saw so the girl can cut her dads hands off and prove hes dead, thus saving their house and land. When the girl cant the step-grandma (?) cuts his hands off and puts them in the gunny sack they also remembered to bring along. They threaten the girl to keep quiet about how she obtained the hands and the next day she goes into the police station claiming they were dropped on her door. (ah living down to the sewer expectations of the clans code).

The bounty hunter later comes to the house and gives her some unclaimed money and lets her know in subtle ways how proud he is of her heroic behavior.

What? Yes a good example for her younger siblings to follow in the life of crazy, destructive, sick family traditions.

Added to the absurdity was a comment by someone working on the film, who expressed interest in filming a scene in one of the caves in the Ozarks so they could show the great caves, thus encouraging tourism. What ~ stay the #@!^ away from the land of crazy!",1409097600,4,3764,4.489766081871345

Proves you don't have to have mega-budgets, superstars, and scream blockbuster on the way hyping it for months to put out a truly good product. Best $6.00 I've spent in a long time. Jennifer Lawrence is good but so were the rest of the cast, unlike other scripts, it is so well written you could imagine other actresses in the lead role doing as well. And, it leaves you with a sense that whoever made this must have lived it to some extent. It's a who-done-it that is kind of low key, slow moving, but compelling at the same time. Yeah, you want to know what happened but you like watching the journey so you're not in a hurry.",1407974400,8,691,4.40625

4116848,4,B003EYVXTQ,"This movie is a great introduction to Jennifer Lawrence filmography.  Winter's Bone (2010) is a southern gothic tale about one girl's life and her struggle to keep her family together. This movie will very much appeal to feminists and women in general, because it has strong female characters/leading roles.  The acting is exceptionally good, and the story line should keep you interested till the very end.

SPOILER ALERT: The only fault I found with this film (hence only 4 stars) is that the ending in my opinion was not bloody enough.  In fact, the ending was not violent at all.  I was expecting/or rather awaiting for a showdown between Teardrop and the men who presumably murdered his younger brother, that is now shown, only assumed in the film that it might happen...There is tension throughout the entire movie, some scenes involving physical altercation, and that's about it when it comes to violence...",1407024000,,914,4.9868421052631575

4116861,5,B003EYVXTQ,"Seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly has a problem. She's stuck trying to manage a run-down household that consists of her ailing Mom, two younger siblings, an absent father, and no income to support them. That problem becomes minor when Ree learns that her meth-cooking Dad has put up their home and land for bail - and is now nowhere to be found. Things come to a head when Ree is told she has just days to produce Jessup (her father) or face eviction. She attempts to follow what little trail Jessup has left behind with no idea of the dangers that await her.

Winter's Bone is an independent film directed by Deborah Granik who shared screenwriting credits with Anne Rosellini, the latter also doing double duty as producer. The film is derived from the Daniel Woodrell novel that carries the same title. With a running time of approximately 100 minutes, the movie follows the book very closely, leaving out only a few scenes that have little impact on the main story. Granik leads the viewer through the hillbilly subculture of southern Missouri, taking care to not only show the level of poverty and the ravages of the methamphetamine trade, but to also share some of this regions musical heritage (which I understand was provided by actual locals that appear in the film).

Jennifer Lawrence gives a powerful performance that belies her years. Her character is perceptive and extremely determined, but a lot of what Ree doesn't know is also evident. Being the focus of almost every scene, Jennifers portrayal is consistent and as believable as anything I've ever seen. I'm not sure how much sway 'Winters Bone' will have come Oscar time, but it would be truly a shame if Jennifer Lawrence didn't at least receive a nomination spot for this effort. Some may recognize Lawrence from the cable sitcom, The Bill Engvall Show, but the rest of the cast is not from your typical casting list. John Hawkes appears as Rees menacing Uncle, Teardrop, and Dale Dickey gives a tough-as-nails performance as one of the distant relatives Ree ends up crossing paths with.

I do have one issue with this otherwise fine project. Whether by intent, or due to the constraints of an independent film budget, the entire film is shot using close-in camera shots. The effect, for me, was a somewhat claustrophobic view of the surroundings. I think a number of scenes would have benefited from a larger perspective. As an example, having no car, Ree often resorts to walking fair distances to continue her quest, but the viewer gets no sense of this in the movie.

Other than that, 'Winter's Bone' will draw you in and leave you thinking well after the film is over. As bleak as Winter's Bone tends to be, you can't help but admire Ree for her sense of obligation and her refusal to back down in the toughest of situations. If you're looking for a Hollywood ending, you won't find it here; but what you should find is a glimmer of hope.",1405900800,2,2910,4.72244094488189

Everybody except her knows or suspects her father's fate but not one of them will tell her.

However he has recently missed a court date and if he does not show up, he will lose his house. Therefore it is incumbent on Ree to find him or the family will be put out of their house. In trying to track him down, Ree has to deal with some unpleasant characters, most especially local meth kingpin Thump (Ron Hall) and Merab (Dale Dickey), a woman with connections to Thump. She also has to deal with her father's brother Teardrop (a fantastic John Hawkes) who keeps things close to his chest and may fall into the violence and drug habits which plague some in the area.

The performance from Lawrence is fantastic. She conveys a very determined woman who is not cowed by some terrifying and legally ominous circumstances and who cares about her family enough not to shrink from the responsibility of taking care of her depressed mother and the younger siblings who rely on her. Lawrence will be a big star although I would bet most of the roles offered to her will not cast a shadow on this role. This is a meaty, juicy role and she sucks all the juice out of it, conveying thoughtfulness, toughness, and the ability to teach her siblings what they need to know in an unsympathetic world.

The plot is quite well elucidated and we understand the role of all the characters we meet. The writing is spare and minimalist from a novel by Daniel Woodnell. The screenplay is co-written by director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini who convey a bleak, hostile environment in the Ozarks of Missouri. The acting was almost totally done by locals from the area where the movie was filmed. This movie truly deserved many more Oscars than it received at the Oscars.",1396915200,33,2248,4.7150127226463106

I found myself just sitting there, thinking after it ended.  I will definitely be watching it again soon, and I highly recommend it.  (As far as the rating goes, there is a bit of foul language and discussions of drug use/dealing.  There are also a couple somewhat violent scenes.  There is one scene in particular that might be too much for the squeamish to handle.

It's one of those movies that has stuck with me in the form of flashback memories popping into my head at random.

There's such a VAST difference between the kind of lives people lead: successful, happy, wealthy, giving, ""normal"" to the homeless heroine addict living in the Dumpster in the alley...and every kind of life in between. Creepy.

4116931,5,B003EYVXTQ,This movie was about a single issue in one young girls life but touched on the culture of the illegal drug circle in the Ozarks. The acting was good and the music was excellent.,1395705600,,177,4.235294117647059
4116932,1,B003EYVXTQ,"In this film, you get to see (in case you haven't already) that poor people and ultra-rural communities with real-life problems still exist outside of the typical film world. They stop scenes constantly just to show you, from the local music to the local problems and the local populace itself.

It's a lot like a stylized documentary. It's kind of like a voyeuristic journey into a place you may or may not know--or care, which is important--exists.

But there is no story. There is nothing interesting happening most of the time besides showing us the land and the people, all of which are certainly unique to film, but have nothing to do with the story. In fact, you could steal this plot, put it in another context entirely, and I guarantee you with absolute certainty that critics would actually, for once, think there's another point besides the setting.

This film is slow. Staggeringly slow. Pretentiously slow, perhaps to mirror the abundance of vapid nothingness that happens in these communities--and you know that's the point, because you'll notice no one talks about the story in their reviews. They talk about the setting, maybe the acting, or the fact that it's eye-opening (maybe it is for some people who get off on watching really, really poor people deal with typical problems). It's easy to forget that there's a story at all, somewhere in there.

Typically, this is just a saying, but I actually did fall asleep during the film. That's not a good sign. And don't get me wrong, I can appreciate very good filmmaking when it's there. I like to look behind the meanings of classic films, and I typically enjoy them.

But there is no meaning to be found here. It's a blueprint of a film that does its job getting the ""Look, everyone, this place exists! These people exist! Isn't that incredible!?"" but doesn't seem to care at all about ""So, how do we make this scene interesting for people who already know there's another world outside their own?""

Viewer ignorance is assumed from the very start. The film presumes you don't know anything, and that it doesn't matter what the actual story is, so long as it reflects the place and its inhabitants, which would be a lot more interesting if I wasn't presumed to be an idiot about that.

This is not a good film when it comes to cohesive storytelling. It absolutely, undeniably falls apart in its pacing and total inability to tell a story. But, and this is key, it does something different from any film I've ever seen, and its plans from the start are to show you this new world of backwater poverty and its problems. It truly is a stylized documentary.

It's a film meant to be analyzed until it bleeds, but not actually meant to be watched.

It's voyeurism of a setting it assumes will awe and amaze you just by its very existence. But that's all it ever tries to do. And, since it never comes together, it deserves praise for what it *does* do rather extraordinarily, but also needs to be harshly criticized for where it fails in its literally sleep-inducing pacing, pretentious beliefs about the audience, and its near-nonexistent storytelling.

I would recommend this only to people who love to feel smart and enlightened about something or another during film, who like to talk about the acting and the excellent portrayal of the setting, and feel content with just that. In truth, this is an animated textbook more than a story.

A critic's wet dream in the departments in which critics focus, and a viewer's feeling of enlightenment *if* they had no idea from the beginning that this strange, bizarre type of place exists. But that's it. If what everyone's raving about doesn't hype you up, the film won't do anything to help you out in feeling otherwise.

An outstanding documentary and a highly-competent look into the dirt-poor backwoods, but in no way a complete film.",1395619200,13,3847,4.74251497005988

4116963,5,B003EYVXTQ,"This is the story of a girl trying to find her father to save her family's home from being possessed by a bail bondsman. Her father (who cooks meth) put the property up for bond and then did not show for his arraignment. She has one week to either produce her father or prove he is dead before their meager possessions are confiscated. Everyone in her poor, rural, Ozark mountain community seems to know something about her father's whereabouts but no one is willing to talk. Ree (our hero) bravely navigates this treacherous social terrain and is met with everything from hostility to death threats.

What is so great about this movie? First, the setting. Very authentic. A real picture of rural poverty. The set design is great. Just enough detritus and debris to make it look believably trashy but not overly done.

Second, the acting. Not just Jennifer Lawrence (who was excellent). John Hawkes (Teardrop) was also terrific.

Third, the cast. In my opinion, this was even better than the acting. The ""look"" of the people was consistent with the hard, meager, ""barely existing"" life they have. That, along with the great set, gives you a sense of ""presence"" with the protagonist.

Finally, the story. I love movies with a smoldering sense of subtle tension throughout as opposed to big dramatic scenes. This one nailed it. Nothing felt overdone. There is no happy breakthrough that leaves us relieved that our hero finally gets her due (except for a small unexpected gift from the bail bondsman at the end). What little help she gets is given grudgingly and from a compulsive sense of loyalty that is devoid of any sentimentality. The ending is satisfying but does not give you the happy Hollywood notion that Ree's life will finally change course and will allow her a way out of the hopeless situation she was born into. Regardless, it is a great movie and I highly recommend it.",1392768000,26,1883,4.766871165644171
4116964,4,B003EYVXTQ,"[In what follows I try to avoid ""spoilers"" and as a result don't give a very detailed account of the story.  Trust me that the narrative lines are clear!]

A good story, well-acted, and economically told -- though I have a few reservations that keep it out of the 5-star range.  First, it is so beautifully shot that it makes the desolated backwoods of southern Missouri seem glamorous.  Maybe we're meant to feel the contrast between the beauty of the compositions and the desperateness of the lives, but when the broken-down houses and trailers look beautiful, things have gone too far.  I recently saw ""Mean Streets,"" and Scorsese resisted the temptation (if he ever felt it) to glamorize the setting.  Second, there's an undertow of sentimentality to the story that makes it finally less compelling than, say, ""True Grit,"" another movie about a resourceful young woman seeking to find out what happened to her father and having help from a less-than-perfect adult male.  That sentimentality isn't a matter of Jennifer Lawrence's character Ree's being very courageous and resourceful -- there's nothing wrong with that.  But her two younger siblings are picture-book adorable, and when her meth-addicted uncle presents them with baby chicks at the end of the movie, one feels that the hopefulness that the end of the narrative has signaled has been rather too heavily underlined.

On the positive side, though, the script is good -- the characters are credibly (given their circumstances) reticent, and the working out of the plot avoids cliche and comes to an effective climax that is both gruesome and moving.  The characters too all seem to have a bit more depth than either their speech or actions reveal.  They are capable of surprising us, with acts of kindness and brutality, and the movie catches very well the sense of constriction of their lives, even in the rural setting: we soon pick up the limited geography of the place, as Ree tries to get her neighbors and relatives to reveal information about her father, a cooker of methamphetamine, who has dodged bail and thus threatened the property of his family, which he put up as collateral against a court appearance.  It's good too that the movie allows us to infer the connection between meth cooking and drug addiction, on the one hand, and obvious economic distress on the other, without having to spell it out for us in a preachy way.  The director trusts the audience there, as she did not with those baby chicks!

The acting is fine.  I think this was the movie that brought Jennifer Lawrence to prominence, and she does a fine, understated job here.  The temptation is to make the character seem implausibly virtuous, and she avoids that, bringing a range of emotion to bear that convinces us that she is more than just a pasteboard exemplar of what's good.  John Hawkes is fine too, as the uncle who overcomes his reluctance to help her.  The action makes clear that it is Ree's persistence that wins over reluctant people to help her, even when the help is pretty minimal.  The women in the movie are particularly interesting, never posing any threat to the secretive, desperate men they live with, and yet always suggesting a sense of distance from these men and the worst that they do.  Well worth a look, then -- and you can pick it up pretty cheap even on Blu-ray.",1392681600,,3342,4.799301919720768

This is the first movie I saw Jennifer Lawrence in, she was 18 or 19 when the filmed it. She is amazing in it as is the guy (sorry) who plays her scary uncle in the movie.
It's really an epic--young girl goes on a quest to save her family. Usually this kind of thing traditionally has been what male characters have been allowed to do. Before the Hunger Games and, to be fair I think some animated films, the females were more passive in their response to the plot. It's a beautiful thing to see a strong, smart, courageous young woman character be central to the story for a change. Yes we have that in the Hunger Games, but this was made before.
Ree and Katniss (Hunger Games) have some similarities but this isn't JL being JL...we've all seen her in interviews and on the red carpet. She also can be seen to play very different characters (Silver Linings Playbook).
THis movie stayed with me. It is very realistic. I read they used some non-actors from the location. If so they blend seamlessly with the Hollywood actors.

 Love Amazon as well.  I will tell you, I have gotten rid of cable, nothing ever good on anyway, and I use Netflex and Amazon for all my viewing entertainment.  Thanks for doing such a great job and for always being there for your customers!  You deserve to be a success!

I just cannot justify a recommendation.  It would have been more rewarding to spend my time exercising or playing with dogs.

On a positive note, the acting is exceptional, the landscape is consistent, and the Jennifer Lawrence does a wonderful portrayal of her character.

It's a story about a female teenager who has been left with taking care of her 2 younger siblings in the Appalachian Mountains, where many of the adults are addicted to drugs.

The director does a great job of immersing you into that culture. The ensemble is flawless. Jennifer Lawrence is captivating and her relationship with her brother and sister in the movie is very intriguing. Every time I watch it I see something new.

For being so young she has had the maturity to chose scripts that are challenging and unique.  Winter's Bone takes place in the back woods, more poverty stricken that you can imagine. Her life has more burdens than most young wormen could handle. She does not play it as a martyr or with a negative attitude. She plays it as just too busy staying alive to do anything but what she must do. She is one of those stars who has the capability to be working well into her 70s and 80s.

I did not see the methamphetamine side of the story as much as I noticed the utterly desperate human side, as well as the unique social code in effect in that part of the country. It's as if one were looking at a different America, where the sky is forever gray. The story told is one of many families' who hold on to each other despite setbacks, and unfortunately, as a result of their loving attachment, many remain where they are, and the cycle of poverty and wrong turns in life keep on. The movie is not about one topic, it's a depressing tapestry, artfully woven.
Ending has a clue to a tragedy. I encourage you to think several times why the uncle tells the girl to keep the banjo. There is a hint of goodbye in that scene.",1379635200,,854,4.377358490566038

4117076,4,B003EYVXTQ,"Winter's Bone (Debra Granik, 2010)

I watched Winter's Bone almost five months ago as I write the first words of this review. I have been trying to come up with something to say about it that does not somehow include far too many uses of the term ""wow"". I really haven't been doing a good job of it, so I just gave up trying. (Amusingly, it has now been another two months between the time I wrote those first three sentences and the time I am writing this fourth; I guess I hadn't stopped trying hard enough.) This is a movie of uncommon power and grace about people and situations who are uncommonly powerless and graceless, and that takes some doing indeed. Much of this, of course, is down to perfect casting; the film lists Kerry Barden and Paul Schnee as the casting directors in the credits, but as with Granik's previous film, Down to the Bone, I suspect she had a firmer hand in the casting than many directors do. In Down to the Bone, Granik chose as her female lead a young character actress who'd done mostly television work up to that point by the name of Vera Farmiga. The rest is history. Now, take that same story, replace the name of the film with Winter's Bone and the name of the actress with Jennifer Lawrence. Vera Farmiga has gone on to be a respected critical darling, and deservedly so; she makes every movie she is in better than it would otherwise be. Jennifer Lawrence has gone on to be a megastar in (as I write this) just three short years; she worked for scale ($3,000 a week) on Winter's Bone, and landed a cool ten million for Mockingjay. She's worth it, and every frame of film containing her in Winter's Bone attests to this.

Plot: Ree (Lawrence) is a teenager in the rural Ozarks whose family has long been fractured; her father Jessup, a meth dealer, went missing a while back. Her mother is mentally challenged, which leaves Ree the putative head of the household, teaching her younger siblings survival skills and keeping what's left of the family together. They would have gone on like this indefinitely, most like, had not the county sheriff turned up on the family's doorstep one morning saying Jessup is due in court in a week's time. If he doesn't turn up, the family will lose their house, which Jessup put up as collateral last time he got out on bail. And thus, with the reluctant help of Jessup's slightly less dissolute brother Teardrop (Identity's John Hawkes), Ree embarks on a frustrating, and often dangerous, quest to determine the whereabouts of her father.

The plot is good, the movie is perfectly-paced, and the closer that climax gets the more you know where this is going, but as with the best movies of this stripe, Granik teases you with the idea that ""nope, we're not gonna go there, and in the process we will save your sanity, your hope for the human race, and your kindness towards others."" Then she puts the goldfish bowl over your head and shatters it with a mallet, but that's all beside the point. So are the award-caliber performances turned in by any number of other actors in this movie, including Hawkes, Shelley Waggener (Punch-Drunk Love), Ronnie Hall (in his film debut), and Tate Taylor, best known these days as a director (The Help). All of those things are good, but all of them line up as a showcase for the fearsome acting talents of Jennifer Lawrence. Make no mistake: this movie is all about Ree, and Lawrence's performance never lets you forget that. Had it simply been her doing a reading of the character on a bare stage, with someone else feeding all the other characters' lines, I'm not sure it wouldn't have been just as powerful. She's that good here. Her choice of projects since hasn't been constantly good (viz. The House at the End of the Street), but, like Vera Farmiga, Jennifer Lawrence makes everything she appears in better than it would otherwise be. When she has a very good movie behind her, well, the result is something like Winter's Bone. This is one for the ages. ****",1378425600,2,3976,4.5736325385694245

Granika recipient of multiple Sundance Film Festival awardspresents the world of Winters Bone in a manner that alters conventional mainstream cinemas perspective on gender roles, while using a rich visual style to convey contextual symbolism, demonstrating to the audience independent films potential to innovate upon and adopt from the history of storytelling.

Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree, a young sister who dons the persona of backwoods detective to unravel the mystery of her fathers disappearance, meeting all likes of dangerous folk along the way. Lawerences performance is powerful and a definite precursor to her later work in Hunger Games. Aim for Add to Cart, and prepare to enter the gritty hillbilly-noir world of Winters Bone.",1377475200,,821,5.4140625

I am glad I got this movie but take that with a grain of salt. I will buy just about any J Law movie and love every minute of them..,1376784000,,452,3.5757575757575757
