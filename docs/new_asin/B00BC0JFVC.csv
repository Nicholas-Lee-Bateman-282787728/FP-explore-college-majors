5572089,4,B00BC0JFVC,"Filmmaker Katherine Brooks turns the camera on herself in this film. After surgery, Brooks put out a notice on Facebook saying that she would visit the first 50 people to respond. Soon, she had a cross-country itinerary. This film follows her on that journey.

At first, I expected a documentary that showed us the variety of online ""friends"" she had. I expected a few poignant moments, a fair amount of mutual admiration, and perhaps some unintended humor. I thought there might be some mockery of the seriousness with which people treat their online relationships, but I thought it possible, too, that I would see the opposite: a celebration of how real these relationships can be. As it turned out, there was none of the former and some of the latter, but in neither case was I fully prepared for what this film showed me.

Some of the interactions were truly touching, especially those of lesbians (sometimes that's clear, and other times, I assume) who nearly deified Brooks, seeing in her a voice they did not find elsewhere. For them, Brooks seems to be a hero, a friend, and a counselor. There is nothing romantic here--just honest human interactions. One interaction reunites Brooks with a childhood friend for whom Brooks's sexuality apparently proved too much.

But the heart of the film is Brooks herself. Throughout much of this, she is profoundly depressed--suicidally so at times. She comes across as a very fragile person, despite her strengths. I see that another person called the film ""self-indulgent,"" and it's hard to argue with that point. But that self-indulgence is not necessarily a weakness. In fact, it's what gives the film its greatest power. Watching, I was completely mesmerized, and the experience felt extremely intimate, for I was seeing a side of people that is almost never shown, a side, indeed, that was once considered shameful to show. The result is an apparently brutally honest self-portrait and a film that I found impossible not to watch to the end.",1391644800,6,1993,4.943283582089553
5572090,5,B00BC0JFVC,"This documentary is extremely relevant in a world where our lives and connections have become increasingly digitized and virtual. What moved me most about the film was that it was a real slice of a person's life, filmed in raw honesty by an incredibly courageous artist. For the 112minutes of the film, I felt like I was walking next to someone and could feel the joy and anguish as real emotions. Nothing is airbrushed to make it palatable to the greatest number of possible viewers. No place or emotional landscape was left unexplored - that takes a great deal of courage and is what inspired me most. This is a documentary, but it is also a great piece of art. Job well done to Kat Brooks, you are my newest hero! I would recommend this to anyone asking the difficult metaphysical questions in their life, as one person's journey to find meaning again..",1376870400,2,856,4.601307189542483
5572091,5,B00BC0JFVC,"it shows that even In tinsel town that the most talented people can be let by the system , eg hospital post care or inside Hollywood to  Katherine Brooks keep on going my dear be 'Director' of great set of movies.",1376784000,,213,4.195121951219512
5572092,3,B00BC0JFVC,Movie inspired me ...movie was alittle depressing though. Interesting people wish storyline was more about each individual Katherine met. Make you want to go on the road .,1371254400,,171,5.142857142857143
5572093,5,B00BC0JFVC,"I can literally not say enough about this film, it had (& will continue to have) such a powerful impact on me. It's not a movie, it's a movement. It reminds us that we are not alone, that no time spent on the internet can replace a real hug or a face to face conversation. It's all about connecting in the most genuine way. The guts Kat had to make it, to film herself as she did is something that has forever changed me. She's redefined the word ""hero"" in my world. She took control of her life & became the change she wishes to see. This is an incredibly inspiring film! You must see this film, you will walk away from it with a new view of our world...a better one.",1368662400,7,668,4.068181818181818
5572094,2,B00BC0JFVC,"Well, I already wrote my review once and now am being asked to write it again . . . and I don't want to expend any more energy on this self-indulgent and sad film.  I think it is good that Katherine Brooks has made the move to documentaries.  Next time, skip photographing yourself and focus on the stories of others.  I did not see any personal responsibility taken by KB for the state of her life.  You cannot keep being a victim to your past.  I hate to sound so harsh, but I call them like I see them.  Good luck.",1368144000,12,517,4.069306930693069
5572095,5,B00BC0JFVC,"Kat you out did yourself!!  Fantastic movie which shows the transformation of you, while you are on your journey, and including all the players that have a hand in changing you from a caterpillar to a beautiful butterfly.  I would recommend this movie 100%...You took a big chance but it paid off!!  Will be purchasing it for sure!!

Now for the sceptic, rent it and see for yourself.  You will want to buy for sure.

If you want to see a movie where ""connection"" is the main mantra, than this movie is for you. Katherine Brooks takes it to a higher level and is empathetic, caring, and compassionate to all that she meets. Her journey was one of connection, not only with her facebook friends, but also with herself. A movie of a lifetime.",1367798400,5,740,4.485074626865671
5572096,5,B00BC0JFVC,"Just watched this film and all the extras. Katherine Brooks has stepped boldly out of a very crappy place in her life and embraced the deepest human connection there is: Face to face, full on human contact. Thank you Katherine, for having the courage to seek out those lost and marginalized and giving us all some hope! I urge everyone to purchase this movie, get a group of your friends, aquaintances, even throw in some folks you really don't know and watch this together. You won't be sorry!",1367625600,4,494,4.625
5572097,5,B00BC0JFVC,"1 year ago I discovered Director Katherine Brooks and her film, Face 2 Face, on Twitter. At that time I was not an active part of society and hadn't been years. I was battling anxiety and depression, and I was losing the battle. After seeing Face 2 Face I was inspired to get off of my couch, conquer my demons and begin to truly live my life. I am eternally grateful to Katherine for her willingness to openly share her experiences with us in Face 2 Face. If you have ever felt alone, unloved, under-appreciated or just want to be inspired you must watch this film - you will not be disappointed and you will understand why Face 2 Face is not just a movie, it is a movement! Get connected!",1367452800,6,690,4.2748091603053435
5572098,5,B00BC0JFVC,"I was fortunate to see a pre-release streaming showing of this wonderful movie last year. I fell in love with this movie instantly and was ""on the edge of my seat"" during the entire film. The topic of this film is very current and I hope that everyone (yes, that means you too) rents or purchases this movie.... gotta see it!

I connected immediately and very deeply with this film, not only because of knowing some of Ms. Brooks personal history and struggles (facebook friend and former myspace friend), but also because the topic hit home due to my own experiences with friends versus ""friends"". I realized while I was recovering from major life-changing surgery, that pretty much NONE of my facebook friends who knew and said they'd visit me ever did. What a profound experience and lesson it was for me to discover that online friendships are not anything close to face2face friendships. Since I saw Katherine's new movie, I made a point to start picking from my friends list and making a friend date with them to connect with them in a more real and genuine way, through face 2 face contact.

See/get/WATCH this movie... better yet,  create a facebook event, invite all your facebook friends over for a movie night. Leave plenty of time after for discussion, or schedule a discussion at another time.",1367366400,2,1306,4.744493392070485

8565595,4,B00BC0JFVC,"I really enjoyed this - made me laugh, made me cry.  Kat is certainly a unique personality and I get some people may not appreciate that, but I appreciate her honesty.  Life is tough enough in the best of circumstances and depression and suicidal thoughts can make it crippling.  If you've never dealt with either you may not understand this journey, if you have, it will likely speak to you on a pretty personal level.

I don't see any reason to criticize her for talking honestly about these issues and I didn't think she made everything about her.  Its quite clear that she suffers from anxiety and I suspect its because she's extremely empathetic.  She takes others pain and makes it her own - that's a lot to carry in a journey like this.  This wasn't a ""What's your favorite color?"" project, this was a ""How do you continue to get out of bed when you don't want to live?"" project.  She seemed to be very in the moment with everyone.  She engaged, asked the questions I would have wanted to, and clearly wanted to hear the answers.

Reconnecting with the childhood friend that caused the pain - I loved that - so very personal.  Its clear that Emiline still cared for her and wanted to make things right - seems like a really nice woman - and Kats reaction to the tux had me laughing loud enough for the neighbors to hear.  Its great to see people healing and reflecting on how much life and our understanding of it changes over time.

I think I would enjoy having one good dinner with Kat and just free talking about anything and everything.  I'm certain it wouldn't be a boring night.",1446854400,,1591,4.441379310344828
8565596,5,B00BC0JFVC,A BIG THANKS TO KATHERINE BROOKS FOR THIS FILM YOU SAVED ME,1427673600,,59,4.0
8565597,1,B00BC0JFVC,"I couldn't get halfway through. She is so self-absorbed and annoying. I just kept wanting to smack her and tell her wash her dirty hair. if you want to watch a documentary where someone who can't even get her suicide right wants to whine for almost 2 hours, then I guess I would highly recommend this movie.",1419552000,2,307,4.4035087719298245
8565598,5,B00BC0JFVC,Director Katherine Brooks was brilliant by coming up with the idea of meeting her 1st 50/5000+ virtual friends on Facebook who responded to her status update. She is going through a rough time one of it was no one visited her when she was recovering from a surgery and was feeling lonely and hasn't had a hug for a long time and was grateful for her to share her experiences in this film and how those people she have met inspired her to be strong and to live life to the fullest.  I have definitely learn alot from this film. I highly recommended it,1406073600,,550,4.288461538461538
8565599,5,B00BC0JFVC,This movie is from a favorite director I enjoy her movies...and dvd came great condition and packaging. will order more movies in future.....,1402617600,,141,5.173913043478261
8565600,3,B00BC0JFVC,"i stumbled on this video by accident looking for facebook movie ""the social network"".  apparently, i like to watch these types of videos (face 2 face, etc)  because i do not have the time, energy, or patience to deal with these ""type"" (katherine brooks, etc) of people in real life.  maybe watching this video will help me to understand who these people are, but i didn't even have the time or patience to watch every single minute of this video -brush my teeth, pee, etc.  long story short, i can understand why no one cared about her when she was in the hospital, suicide, etc.  these ""type"" of people (extreme extroverts?) seem to have a raw energy from a physically well connected brain and body that are heavily influenced by the commercial values (drugs, technology, etc) of today's society. my guess is that lots of physical exercise and good nutrition, instead of sitting (driving) and smoking, would cure most of her ills.  sorry, i forgot, these ""type"" of people always have more important things to do than exercise and nutrition.",1400889600,2,1041,4.7555555555555555
8565601,5,B00BC0JFVC,"This movie is a must see. If you ever felt the need that you needed to make a call or go see someone, this movie will re emphasize that. Put the social media away and reconnect with people, the ones that matter, not the ones that don't is the takeaway. And get rid of things that don't matter. Katherine Brooks is a fabulous film maker and awesome person. Keep on with real movies, and real people",1395705600,,397,4.2368421052631575
8565602,5,B00BC0JFVC,"Love this film, truly touched the heart, its brilliant! It is Raw and Real and nothing but Honesty, which most films and people lack. It takes a whole lot of courage and strength to put yourself out there in the open like Katherine has done in this Film, she is an amazing director and a strong loving person who just keeps giving, she definitely outdid herself. People who do not appreciate or judge this film either do not struggle or are afraid of the truth or would rather hide it. We are human. I really hope this film reaches everyone, it can definitely help and reach people with daily struggles in society today. There isn't much out there to truly help them, not like this. People can and will for sure relate to this film and self healing journey if they are open and can become inspired to be better, stronger and to continue their life journey by helping each other grow. We all have our struggles. I strongly recommend this film! I believe in this movement! Her message in this film is really powerful! We for sure need more Face 2 Face in this world to provide Love and Compassion to one another! We need real connections and interactions to thrive. No one should feel alone in times of struggles or happiness. We are not alone! The connections experienced in the film are very touching and real. Truly admire Katherine for making this film, its exceptional. Watch it for yourself and be open about everything! Pass it on and spread the Love, Give a Hug! I speak highly about this film to people and most agree right away with the Face 2 Face message.. I give it 6 stars!!",1391904000,2,1586,4.472413793103448
8565603,5,B00BC0JFVC,"American film writer and director Katherine Brooks decides to set out on a journey to meet 50 of her facebook friends. While recovering from surgery, Katherine was feeling lonely and realized she hadn't had a hug. Brooks posted a status update on her facebook page that she would be willing to go and meet the first 50 people who responded to spend the day with them, and film the whole adventure. The main message of the film is to show people that we spend way too much time on our computers and not enough time (if any) with ""face 2 face"" interactions. I found the film very inspirational. I truly loved it! Katherine was very real and honest and you feel like you are on this journey walking beside her. As I listened to the different struggles of both Katherine and her facebook friends, I realized that we are not alone with our own personal struggles and there is such an importance of having ""face 2 face"" interactions with our friends. Excellent film. I highly recommend it! 5 stars for Katherine on this one.",1391817600,2,1018,4.538043478260869
