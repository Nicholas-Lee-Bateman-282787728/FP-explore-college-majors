A/B/C Import - Australia </a>], but Mikael Persbrandt (Det. Gunvald Larsson in BECK) gives another outstanding performance as Carl Hamilton, the Swedish spy created by Swedish investigative journalist and author Jan Guillou. (I watched this on MhzChoice.vhx with English subtitles.)

NOTE: Jan Guillou, in 1973, published a series of articles exposing a Swedish secret intelligence agency. He was convicted of espionage and served a reduced sentence of 10 months. In 1976, he also exposed a CIA agent who had recruited another Swedish journalist as a spy. The CIA agent was ordered out of Sweden. In 1986, Guillou created his fictional spy, Carl Hamilton. These are not American-oriented novels, but provide another world perspective where supposed enemies, Russians or the PLO, can be your best ally. Unfortunately, only one of the Hamilton novels is available in English:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-s-Enemy/dp/0394589890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy's Enemy</a>.

8560562,4,B00B1BJYRW,"I was so hooked on the Gunvald character in the Beck series that I had to see Persbrandt in something else. He does not disappoint, but I would have liked more of this character. If you're not a Persbrandt fan, I'm not sure what your reaction might be. This is a good thriller, but it's not of the same quality as the Beck series in either writing or directing. But I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1421366400,,390,4.283783783783784
