5586137,3,B00BEIYKX0,"I just saw The Company and was struck by a basic flaw in the film that no one here has mentioned.  It takes place 30 years from the time of the Weathermen's actions in the 1960s.  Therefore, it should be portraying a peer group in their fifties.  Although it is true Redford is a handsome guy in his 70s, he looks his age.  Yet, he and Christie are playing people who are 20 years younger.  I couldn't suspend belief enough to not find this age difference distracting and, therefore, the film, substantially flawed.",1372896000,3,515,4.494623655913978
5586138,5,B00BEIYKX0,"Not surprisingly, this Robert Redford movie is a work of wonderful economy and density.  A strong and good man and loving father, Nick Sloan (Robert Redford), must flee police authorities whose mental qualities are portrayed in the character of a newspaper reporter, a craftily produced cardboard character, likable because it's Shia LaBeouf, but wrong and maniacally possessed with a blind fixity of purpose to hunt down Nick Sloan for a murder he did not commit.  We are shown what our parents always taught us: namely, that all that matters in the herd mentality of the self-righteous, whether police or reporter, is that, rightly or wrongly, fairly or unfairly, ""a man is known by the company he keeps.""  A modern morality play worthy of Aesop.",1372636800,2,748,5.016129032258065
5586139,5,B00BEIYKX0,"I watched this movie 1 month ago in a Toronto movie theater and I was shock how good its storyline it was and the friendship and comrade love between those old weathermen, even after soooo many years they are still loyal to their friends and cause.

5586140,5,B00BEIYKX0,"Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) turns herself into the FBI. She was a long time Weatherman (SDS) fugitive that was involved in bank robbery decades ago where a person was killed. This sets off a chain of events that ripples through the other fugitives of the group, particularly NY attorney Jim Grant (Robert Redford) who for some reason never made it to Putney. Jim has a daughter (kudos to Jackie Evancho) and goes on the lam. He becomes the attention of a national man hunt and is also pursued by Albany reporter Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf) who broke the story. Ben discovers that this saga has layers.

The characters are not only well developed, but they evolve within the film. There is a slightly layered mystery. We get clues about each layer prior to it being revealed. The film utilizes the 60's movement as background with the expected speeches, but also looks at the human side of things which are not as black and white. Mildly heart warming too.

The film has a few slow scenes, one that comes to mind is the jail interview of Solarz. But that should not deter any 60's child from enjoying a film about growing up and changing responsibilities.

5586141,3,B00BEIYKX0,"THE COMPANY YOU KEEP is a 2012 political thriller film adaptation of the 2003 novel by Neil Gordon that was released in theaters in April 2013. Gordon's book, as is this movie, is set against a backdrop of the rise and fall of the Weather Underground, the radical antiwar group of the Vietnam era.  The book is a sweeping American saga about sacrifice, the ecstatic righteousness of youth, and the tension between political ideals and family loyalties.

Robert Redford is the star, the director, and the co-producer of COMPANY. He portrays a former Weatherman named Nick Sloan. The main action takes place in the late 1990s...some 25 years after a bank robbery and killing of a guard. Sloan's group had been on the run but are now comfortably ensconced in mainstream American life.  Sloan has become a civil rights attorney named Jim Grant and is a widower living in Albany, New York with his young daughter (Jackie Evancho).

At the beginning of the movie, Jim Grant is having a bad day. His client, a successful organic veggie grower, is concerned about explaining the organic marijuana growing under the veggies to the FBI...and has a friend (Susan Sarandon) who has surrendered to the FBI to face murder charges for participating in a bank robbery in which a guard was killed. A local investigative reporter named Ben Shepherd (Shia LeBeouf) has just interviewed him and asks some very personal questions...but mainly why he isn't representing the friend of his marijuana-growing client. Shepherd is about to break the biggest story of his young career.

Roger Ebert, in his review of COMPANY published one week after his death, calls the cast of the movie ""almost too perfect.""  Ebert is talking about the good-looking and still vibrant movie stars that play the aged Weathermen:  Redford, Susan Sarandon, Julie Christie, Nick Nolte and Richard Jenkins...all in their sixties and seventies.  Ebert gives the film 2.5 stars out of 3...almost a ""thumbs up"" for he admires the talents of Robert Redford although probably not the character he plays in COMPANY.

Stephen Holden in his NYT review has a different slant on the film.  He slams Ben Shepherd, the Albany newspaper reporter who outs Grant. Holden says Shepherd ""far from being a dedicated seeker of truth and justice, is a smug, arrogant manipulator who exploits his connection with Diana (the underused Anna Kendrick), a college hookup who now works for the F.B.I., to gain privileged information."" Holden further expounds: COMPANY is ""not kind to the ailing newspaper business. If Ben is meant to represent a quintessential bright young journalist, Mr. LaBeouf makes him an obnoxious, unscrupulous troublemaker out for personal glory.""  I rather liked the young relentess reporter...who reminded me of real-life Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post.

For a few days after I saw the movie, I wondered why Redford make this film?  It couldn't be a diatribe on domestic terrorism: the Oklahoma bombing (1995) had not been resolved and Boston (2013) was way in the future at the time of this tale.  Maybe a treatise in how to be on the run to avoid capture for many years: there was a bit of FBI-bashing in the film.  Or perhaps to get a new wardrobe of tailored blue denim button-down shirts and tight jeans. For a septuagenarian...Redford does look good in his clothes.  And wait until you see Julie Christie...still beautiful at age 71.",1368576000,14,3399,4.968253968253968
5586142,3,B00BEIYKX0,"For the better part of 50 years, Robert Redford has had a hand in the overall direction of Hollywood.  Speaking of direction, Redford is not only one of the most well-known and respected actors in the business, he's also spent half of his career producing and directing.  He's an absolute master of his craft, starring in some of the best Hollywood dramas to date, including All the President's Men, The Natural, and Out of Africa.  However, even though Redford has long been an established, respected actor, he has earned the majority of his critical acclaimed through directing.  Previously, he has been nominated for several prestigious directing awards for his work on such films as Quiz Show, A River Runs Through It, and The Horse Whisperer - while taking home an Academy Award for Best Director for Ordinary People.  Redford is once again behind the camera, as well as in front of the camera in the new thriller, The Company You Keep.

Directed by Robert Redford, The Company You Keep also stars Redford as Jim Grant, a wanted fugitive and former member of a left wing radical group that robbed a Michigan bank and killed a security guard in 1980.  More than 30 years later, Grant lives in the state of New York working as a low profile lawyer and is raising his young daughter - until one of his radical associates, Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) is arrested.  After an abundance of digging and asking questions in regards to the Michigan robbery, a news reporter, Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf), uncovers Grant's true identity and forces him to flee New York.  With Grant on the run and Shepard in search of a story, both men are on a quest for information - all of which involves past secrets and the still ""at large"" members of the Michigan bank robbery.  Terrence Howard, Julie Christie, Nick Nolte, and Anna Kendrick also star in supporting roles.

Initially, it's a bit difficult to figure out where the film's plot is taking you.  Is this going to turn into another rendition of The Fugitive?  Well, yes and no.  The Fugitive actually treats ""the fugitive"" like a fugitive (with constant pursuit), while The Company You Keep shows a dimwitted FBI that can't manage to catch up to a 75 year old man on the run (literally).  At one point, Redford is on the run through a forest, with a bunch of FBI agents in hot pursuit - but Redford apparently still gets around pretty well for an old guy.  Still, this particular scene is a bit humorous at first, but eventually reality sinks in and Redford's character realizes that it's unlikely he'll be able to avoid those youthful FBI legs for a sustainable amount of time.  In any event, The Fugitive at least provided a few ""edge of your seat"" action sequences, but sadly, The Company You Keep completely devoid of any of the pulse-pounding interactions.

Normally, one would presume that Robert Redford would be the standout in a film that he stars in and directs.  Surprisingly, it's Shia LaBeouf that takes the ""standout"" title in this particular film.  Not only does LaBeouf's performance outshine Redford's in this film, but he also outshines nearly all of his previous roles.  Typically, LaBeouf plays the role of a character that is best described as sniveling or flat out annoying, so you can imagine the surprise of seeing him play a serious character, tackling a serious subject matter.  Not only does he play a serious character, but there's very little to not enjoy about his character - for once, someone that instantly exudes a tremendous amount of confidence and recognizes his strengths.  For once, LaBeouf stars in a film where he isn't overshadowed by Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), Michael Douglas (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps), or a bunch of transforming vehicles (Transformers).

Overall, The Company You Keep is a bit more thrilling than originally anticipated.  While the film is increasingly interesting (occasionally confusing) for the first half of the film, it quickly takes a turn downhill into an easily predicable film.  However, Robert Redford and Shia LaBeouf are delightfully entertaining and easily carry this film from beginning to end, while still allowing for the ensemble supporting cast to appear for a few moments here and there.

5586143,4,B00BEIYKX0,"""The Company You Keep"" (2013 release; 125 min.) is a political thriller directed by and starring Robert Redford. As the movie opens, we watch old TV footage from the 1970s when the Weather Underground, a radical anti-Vietnam War movement, terrorized the US with a number of bomb attacks and killings. (Please note that while the movie is a work of fiction, the Weather Underground in fact did exist.) Next we see Sharon Solarz (played by Susan Sarandon), a former Weather Underground member, getting arrested 30 years after a bank heist in Michigan horribly gone wrong, causing the death of a bank teller. It was thought there were two further WU members involved in that heist. We then meet Jim Grant (played by Robert Redford), who in reality is Nick Sloan, another former WU member who took on a new life as an attorney in Albany and has a 12 year old daughter. While all this is happening, we also meet Ben Shepard (played by Shia LaBeouf), a newspaper of the Albany Sun-Times reporter who sees an opportunity to score some major scoops and hence advance his career. To tell you much more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is an enjoyable cat-and-mouse political thriller, in which Redford, directing himself, tries to stay ahead of both the FBI and the newspaper reporter. I wouldn't call it an action thriller, as this is more of a talk movie than an action movie, and that's fine with me. Second, while watching LaBeouf in the newspaper offices trying to piece the puzzle together, I couldn't help but think back of those same newspaper scenes in ""All the President's Men"" with Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Of course, I'm not calling ""The Company You Keep"" the classic that was ""All the President's Men"". Third, I was astonished to see so much acting talent gathered in a single movie. Just to name a few I haven't mentioned yet: Julie Christie follows her outstanding role in ""Away From Her"" of a few years ago with another great performance. Even in some of the smaller roles, there are several standouts. Check out Anna Kendrick as an FBI agent (less than 10 min. of screen time, but she lights up the screen when she's on), and also Brit Marling as the daughter of the former police investigator (maybe 15 min. of screen time), following up on her noteworthy roles last year in ""Sound of My Voice"" and ""Arbitrage"". Both of these ladies are rapidly climbing the ranks of actresses. And last but not least there is 12 yr. old singing phenom Jackie Evancho, here playing the role of Redford's young daughter. She acts with such maturity that completely belies her age (and her young appearance), so much so that it's a little weird, to be honest. And I still haven't even mentioned Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot, Chris Cooper, and on and on.

This movie made quite a splash when it premiered at the Venice Film Festival last Fall, and rightfully so. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was reasonably well attended, somewhat to my surprise in fact. All that aside, ""The Company You Keep"" is a well paced thriller, even if there are some clear flaws/gaps in the plot. But the acting performances are what makes this movie worth seeking out, whether in the theatre or on DVD.",1367107200,5,3334,4.697435897435898
5586144,3,B00BEIYKX0,"we have read or seen this story before and there is nothing fresh or new to it here. try Sidney Lumet's RUNNING ON EMPTY with the late River Phoenix, Christine Lahti and Martha Plimpton for a flawless story about these radicals' lives post sixties.

this film is also about sixties radicals from the SDs who have been underground for decades coming to the surface. in Robert redford's case he may not even have been guilty of the death of which he is accused. meanwhile, the most woefully inept rendition of the FBI ever put on screen tries to track him down. the FBI agent in charge is a virtual caricature of an inept bureaucrat. this movie would have been better losing this whole part of the story.  Redford did not need to be on the run from the FBI to try and clear his name. the main action should have been between him and Julie Christie, his SDS lover who could clear him.

although it is technically possible for redford's character to have a twelve year old daughter, it really doesn't ever mesh well with this scenario. his wife, conveniently dead, would have had to have been decades younger than he which rather clashes with his SDS image. also, although these characters would also be in their sixties, Redford is well past his sixties and arguably too old for this role. and he really needs to have grey hair, not bottle blonde, at this stage of his career, especially if playing a seriously minded SDS underground character. plus how did he become a lawyer?  i had to be fingerprinted and put in the national database back in the early seventies when i became a lawyer.  how did he ever get past this?

this could have been a very thoughtful, dramatic film, almost like a play, between Redford and Christie, but it is this jumble instead.  too bad.  it could have been extraordinary.

although Shia laboufe plays a reporter here, hot on Redford's past, I felt that he, along wiith the FBI, took away from the story between these two rather than adding to it.

5586145,2,B00BEIYKX0,"""The Company You Keep"" is a 2012 thriller about 60s revolutionaries who surface in the present day. It is Robert Redford's 9th outing as a director, and his 4th as actor-director (""Ordinary People"", ""Horse Whisperer"", ""Lions for Lambs""). Redford plays a former radical who assumed a new identity following a bank robbery in which a guard was killed. 30 years later his identity is exposed by an ambitious reporter (Shia LaBeouf), so he puts his daughter (singer Jackie Evancho) with his brother (Chris Cooper), and searches for the one woman who can prove his innocence (Julie Christie), contacting his old associates (Nick Nolte, Richard Jenkins) along the way. All the time he is pursued not only by the reporter but also by the FBI (Terrence Howard, Anna Kendrick).

There are few surprises in a plot that works itself out in a predictable manner, and one which offers no real drama. And the twin pursuits (by the reporter and by the FBI) don't generate much tension. Though the acting is very good throughout, the director's approach is more clinical and thus few of the characters elicit much emotion, either on screen or in the audience.

BTW - Kudos to AGT runner-up Jackie Evancho who does a fine job in her first film. Susan Sarandon is absolutely marvelous and is in the film far too briefly. Robert Redford's best acting is done while running. His good looks once commanded the screen and compensated for a lack of acting skills, but at 76 he needs to put more effort into the acting. IMO his last decent acting job was in ""Spy Game"" (2001).

The elephant in the room, of course, is the fact that there is already someone who can prove that Redford is innocent (Susan Sarandon), but this glaring fact is never addressed by anyone.

The elephant's twin brother is the constant reference to the Vietnam War being ""30 years ago"". By my math, it's more than 40 years ago. Also, according to Wikipedia, there were never any fatalities associated with the Weatherman bombings and bank robberies. There was a 1981 incident in which former Weathermen joined in a brinks car robbery and two policemen and a security guard were killed.

People who went through the 60s will have some identification with the storyline, but to younger people, it will appear a little absurd. And Redford, at the age of 77 looks a little silly as the ""father"" of 12 year old Jackie Evancho.

Bottom line - a tremendous waste of talent.",1365724800,9,2417,4.742857142857143
5586146,5,B00BEIYKX0,"The DVD is not yet available, but I saw the international screening of this movie in Venice back in September 2012.  I did not get into the premier (I'm not a star or VIP), just a guy who loves to travel and wanted to see Jackie Evancho in her first major movie.  I was able to get a ticket to the public screening.  The movie will probably appeal to many, but mainly to the 60s generation and Jackie's fans.  It is a well done portrayal of someone who did some bad things while protesting, went into hiding, changed his name and now his past has caught up to him.  Jackie plays his daughter whom he will lose if he gets caught and blamed for a killing.  He sends her to his brother's and then proceeds to try to find those from his past that might be able to help him.  Jackie has about 12-15 minutes of on screen time in about 10 scenes.  She, Robert and Shia are the only actors who are in scenes from the beginning of the movie until the very end.  She does a wonderful and very believable job in her role as his daughter.

For those who were not around during the Vietnam days it is difficult to FEEL the social tension that drove young people to radicalism - it was a whole different ball game back then. This film is about doing the right thing and with that chick-full-of-seasoned pro actors it certainly cast and directed it well. Its original in its plot - there have been a few others like it but this one is so expertly interwoven with sub-plots that are impressive. The reporter does an excellent job of being a contemptible lout - a visceral metaphor of an evil paparazzi violating people's privacy by trickery just as the FBI guy was completely blinded by his relentless pursuit of an ideal he missed the possibility he had it wrong - not a vote of confidence in the FBI given his nauseating  altruistic preaching even to this day. Redford could have done so much more with just a short 2 minute ending that clarified a few things and would have left us all far more satisfied. You will get a good stream on this rental here at Amazon, the one we used was intermittent and not great. For what it is, this is a masterpiece that ties the past with the present and does it well.",1485993600,,1257,4.489082969432315

5586454,1,B00BEIYKX0,"This movie was a huge disappointment. I expected a LOT better from Robert Redford but it fell well short of the mark, for so many reasons.

SPOILER:

So many things in this story didn't add up:

The FBI is looking for a fugitive for over 30 years and can't find him with all their resources, technology etc..but a young, brash reporter does a few clicks on Google and voila, all is revealed. Come on!!!

Having Robert Redford as the father of a very young girl made him look even older than usual. Could they not have made it just a bit believable by having his daughter at least in her teens. He looked like a grandpa or great grandpa in this one. SO sad.

He supposedly commits a murder, in the day time, at a bank but he's not even there. Again, come on!!! They did have video cameras in the 70s  in places like banks at least, how could they screw this up so badly?

The lack of chemistry between Julie Christie (she is still so beautiful though) and Robert Redford was painful to watch. Two great actors but no sparks at all!

There were more faux pas, but that was enough to totally discredit this movie, IMO.

Robert Redford has made some wonderful movies, this isn't one of them. Maybe it is time to give directing and acting a miss. Leave a legacy of quality work instead of drivel like this one.",1454716800,,1305,4.315573770491803

5586592,4,B00BEIYKX0,"In the 1960's to early 1970's, the United States was involved in an unjustified and un-winnable war which was taking the lives of young Americans, not to mention the lives of many innocent villagers in a land thousands of miles from America, Vietnam. Groups of young people, mostly of college age, took to the streets of America to protest, showing their disillusionment with their government in marches on Washington D.C., flag burnings in Berkeley, California, and demonstrations in Kent State, Michigan. Some ended tragically. While most of the protest groups were non-violent, mirroring the demonstrations by Martin Luther King, Jr., a few groups crossed the line into using violence and intimidation to make their points. One such group was the so-called ""Weathermen"" or Weather Underground whose goals were not exclusively about fostering political change and shifting social consciousness. Their goals were about overthrowing the United States government.

Fast-forward to the early 21st century. James Grant (Robert Redford who also directs) is a small-town lawyer in upstate New York near Albany with a beautiful daughter. A friend of his from the days of protest, Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) has been arrested for complicity in crimes enacted by the Weather Underground in the 1970's. A stalwart and ambitious young reporter, Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf), begins his own investigation and reveals that James Grant is a false identity. He's actually Nick Sloan, a former Weatherman who has been eluding authorities for over 30 years in connection with a bank robbery gone wrong which resulted in the death of a bank security guard. To elude arrest, trial and possible prison, Sloan created the false identity of Grant in the early 1980's and set up a legitimate law practice.

Grant/Sloan then enacts a highly sophisticated plan. First he compels his estranged brother Daniel Sloan (Chris Cooper) to take temporary custody of his daughter. Then, using fake ID's and disposable phones, he leaves New York and travels to the upper mid-west to Michigan. Two other parties are hot on his trail: Shepard the young reporter, and the FBI. After obtaining the information from Shepherd's reporting, the FBI is now after Sloan as well, desperately trying to resolve a pending case over 30 years old.

The question the film poses: Is Sloan guilty of having been involved with the bank heist or is there some other reason he's on the run? The answers appear to be in Michigan. Shepherd follows Sloan there and meets the locals who seem reluctant to tell him what they know, most strikingly Henry Osborne, a former police chief who originally investigated the robbery. He also meets Osborne's daughter who tells the reporter things which help him piece together the puzzle. Sloan and Shepherd then are trying to find one Mimi Lurie who may have the answers to the puzzle.

A very good film about how Baby-Boomer radicalism didn't die in the 1960's and 1970's but rears its head in the 21st century. Redford is convincing as the mild-mannered-attorney-turned-fugitive. LaBeouf holds his own as the ambitious but nave journalist who won't quit. As the film progresses we get the sense there's an underlying theme about young people's idealism. Shepherd meets Sloan early in the film before he's on the run, and even says of the young reporter he might have been the type to join the movement back in the 1960's. Shepherd represents the idealism of young people in the 21st century although he can only influence change through online articles. The protest marches are long over. The question is not just about the idealism of young people, be they Boomers, Generation X'ers, or Millennium's, but what they did can also say something about who they are. The question about Sloan's involvement with violent acts poses the question about whether or not he was as bad as the system he was fighting.",1443312000,,3890,5.082942097026604

Why, Redford even manages to deaden the lustre of the fabulous Julie Christie with his 'performance-gravitas' ! That's like a black hole swallowing the sun!)

Each member of Robert Redfords over-the-hill cast feels like a beloved and well-worn piece of clothing that Hollywood has decreed is out of style.

5586760,4,B00BEIYKX0,"The 1960s were wild and daring times for some our generation - some more than others. Redford stars in this film as well as directs it with a hero (Nick Nolte and a heroine (Julis Christie) of that era to tell the story of the famous/infamous Weathermen. The underground group was anti-Vietnam war that went beyond clinched fists of the Black Panthers, protest marches of the SDS or college student on campus demonstrations. The Weathermen took up bombs, targeted burnings, and fled capture mainly to Canada while some were caught by the FBI, a number of them were not caught for years until they just got tired of running and gave themselves up to the law authorities. The film is about the ones who were still underground with code names and secret passwords sprinkled around the States as college profs, handymen, or housewives living out their lives in suburbs and wooded hideouts. A tense dialogue between two former lovers (Redford and Christie) are found out by a pesky young journalist who leads the authorities to finally find them out bu tnot until the lovers have a marathon debate about ""giving up"" and why they did what they did. There's a very contemporary motif throughout the film about secrecy and the right for the public to know about war policies and high level secrets as in the Snowden and Manning cases. Why it took so long to hit on the Weathermen 70s events to be filmed is not clear but the film has relevance for our present time - perhaps why Redford waited until 2012 to produce it.",1424563200,4,1511,4.662921348314606

5586920,4,B00BEIYKX0,"This appealing movie falls into a familiar pattern -- a man has to go on the run in an attempt to clear himself of supposed guilt for a crime he didn't commit.  The slightly different angle here is that the crime took place over 30 years earlier -- a bank robbery in which a man was killed by the radical Weather Underground anti-war group -- and that the man on the run is no youngster: he's Robert Redford, looking his age, but a gamer nonetheless.  He has known for years that he was wanted for the crime, but he evaded capture at the time and took on a new identity as Jim Grant, a lawyer in upstate New York.  Now a widower with a twelve year-old daughter (Jackie Evancho), he comes under suspicion of Ben Shepard, an Albany newspaper reporter (Shia La Boeuf).  One of Grant's old radical friends (Susan Sarandon) is arrested on her way to turn herself in, and Grant's name comes up as a possible defense attorney.  It's his refusal to take the case that sparks Shepard's, and eventually the FBI's, interest, and Grant takes off with his daughter.  In New York City, he succeeds in turning her over to the care of his brother (played by Chris Cooper) and heads to the midwest in hopes of finding another former radical friend (and ex-lover) who knows that he wasn't present at the bank robbery and who, he hopes, might be willing to testify to that, even if it means giving herself up.

The old friend is Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie), and he finally gets together with her at a cabin in the woods in the U. P. of Michigan, even as the FBI is closing in.  Up to this point, the movie has been an effective chase-movie.  The reporter Shepard (with the reluctant support of his editor, played by Stanley Tucci) is also in pursuit, and in the course of that pursuit learns things about Grant and Mimi that I won't reveal in the interests of avoiding a spoiler.  The meeting is a bit anti-climactic: Mimi is still as committed as ever to radical causes, while Grant (real name, Nick Sloan) looks back on that part of his past as a period of immaturity.  When Mimi asks what happened to him, he says, ""I grew up.""  And that's about as deep as the discussion gets -- Jim/Nick wants nothing more than to have his life with his daughter, and the intensity of that wish becomes more understandable late in the movie.  He and Mimi end up respectful of one another but further discussion is foreclosed by the FBI's finally running them to ground.  Jim/Nick, in his apparent attempted escape, creates a diversion to draw attention away from Mimi . . . and as far as the plot's concerned, I'll leave it at that.

The acting is fine -- Redford, Christie, Cooper, and Brendan Gleeson (as a Michigan cop) all look their ages and are fully in command of their parts.  It's both touching and heartening to see these old glamorous figures, Redford and Christie, still plying their trades effectively in their 70's.  All the actors are sufficiently skilled to come across as distinct human beings, despite the formulaic nature of the story.  That's true of the younger generation too -- La Boeuf, Brit Marling, and Stanley Tucci do good work.  Sarandon is effective and eloquent in what amounts to a cameo.  In smaller parts yet, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott make an impression.  It's a thoroughly professional job, unostentatiously good-looking and well-paced (Redford himself directed).  It's not philosophically profound, but rather goes for warmth and sentiment, and it carries it off.",1416009600,,3470,4.6172638436482085

5587045,5,B00BEIYKX0,"This is one of the few movies I've seen in recent years that was really worth watching.  It's suspenseful, compelling, and the acting is excellent.  Robert Redford directed this, and he did a superb job of maintaining the tension in the film and revealing insights about the characters as the film progressed.  His portrayal is convincing, and he achieves it without special effects and the other over-the-top devices most films use today.  This made it more human and more believable.  Shia LaBeouf's performance was nuanced.  Although his character is an aggressive reporter, hungry for a big story, LaBeouf does not play him like a caricature.  The reporter is relentless, but he also cares about how his story will affect the people involved, and after a certain point he pursues it as much to help clear the innocent one as to get a headline.  LaBeouf has a talent for portraying confidence but also sensitivity and reflection, and his scenes are expertly crafted to help the viewer follow the progressive realization as his character figures out what really happened 30 years earlier.  The performances by the other well-known actors and actresses--Julie Christie, Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, and more--create a sense of community, of a lasting brotherhood among the former activists that runs deeper than their activist ideals and becomes a commitment to one another that survives the years.  There is much to enjoy in this film.  Each of the actors has a ""moment"" in the film, a part of the film that allows him or her to take center stage and become the focus of the movie, and so there is a feeling by the end that you have known each of them and learned something secret about them.  I liked this about it, and it made the characters more engaging and the story more meaningful.

5587090,2,B00BEIYKX0,"This is a difficult movie to watch for those who were around when the Marxist terrorist group known as the Weather underground and other such groups were bombing, burning, rioting, and even murdering. Sadly, there are those who trust Hollywood and other movie makers with history. While not quite SOVIET style disinformation of their era, the movie certainly serves as an idealistic propaganda piece with the denial of aging Marxists choosing to remain in a capitalist country they sought to bring down while their beloved communism--with 100 million dead--disappears daily in ignominy and defeat.
 As late as 2010 founding member of Weather Underground Bernadine Dohrn claimed: ""The real terrorist is the American government, state terrorism unleashed against the world."" She could just as easily have been Sharon Solarz, the radical member of the group in the movie ""The Company We Keep.""
Sharon Solarz is arrested before she could turn herself in, and much is made of this, as though we should care after her 30 years of hiding from justice. She is part of a violent Marxist, revolutionary group Weather Underground who:  sought the overthrow of a capitalistic government in favor of a totalitarian socialism--one through violent means outside the system.
When she is interviewed by the reporter in jail, she quickly lets him know that she was no drugged out hippie. Correct, they only wanted to ""turn on, tune in, drop out"" while her group robbed, bombed, and murdered.
In 1970 the group planted a bomb with 14 sticks of dynamite in Detroit Police Officers Assn Bld that would have killed a number of people, but for the information supplied by an undercover informant Larry Grathwohl.  March 6, 1970--just one week later--two Weather Underground members blew themselves up accidentally while assembling a bomb meant for servicemen and their dates at a dance in Ft Dix.
In 1978, however, the FBI arrested five members who were plotting to bomb a politician's office. Other bombings and shootings attributed to Weather Underground or like-minded Marxist, terrorist groups continued in 1971-73.
Solarz rants how ""our government was murdering millions,"" and ""committed genocide"" that made her ""crazy"" along with those getting their heads busted for rioting in Chicago and elsewhere, and the draft (which naturally did not affect her since she is female). Hence, it is the government's fault she chose to become a terrorist.
When asked by the reporter if she would do it again, she states yes she would if she didn't have children or elderly parents. Unrepentant still, one cannot help but recall a real Weather Underground founder William Ayers stating in 2001: ""I don't regret setting bombs,"" said Ayers in 2001, ""I feel we didn't do enough."" The Weather Underground was responsible for 30 bombings aimed at bringing down America. He too felt no loyalty to America, where he chose to remain, as he stated in 2001: ""What a country. It makes me want to puke.""
Sharon echoes this as she brags on her loyalty to members of the terrorists while showing no remorse for being part of a group that robbed a bank and murdered a guard in Michigan. This lines up with the real Weather Underground Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert who united with Black Liberation Army to hold up an armored Brink's vehicle in Nyack, N.Y. robbing it of $1.6 million to further their violent activities. This was in 1981, long after Vietnam War ended which is supposed to be why they were terrorists.
 The real Weather Underground chose America's enemies over America, as they chanted: ""Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, the Viet Cong are going to win!"" Incidentally, while they sought to ""bring the war home,"" this was before Kent State, a fact omitted conveniently by Solarz. Many Weather Underground even plotted and trained with North Vietnamese--with whom the US was at war, Cubans, Cambodians, IRA, Quebec Liberation Front, and sought out the Arab terrorists El Fatah. Terrorist do love terrorists, after all.
As for Nick Sloan, he too has been hiding from the police for his crimes. Naturally, Redford chose to portray his character as sympathetic as possible. So we have super dad and delightful daughter running from mean the FBI, who (again) seeks to take him away from his child, while he outsmarts both FBI and local police.
Not that he does it alone. In this make believe world where everyone risk everything to harbor a criminal who the FBI openly chases and they know it, these movement members all aid him at their own peril, despite their 30 year's absence.
Yes, at one level this whole movie is about loyalty. Everyone in the movement is loyal even after 30 years. No one is more loyal than Nick, who has covered for Mi Mi Lurie. Here, I won't go on, lest I spoil the movie, except to say that this loyalty is about as quixotic as is their belief that they could bring down the US with violence. Their loyalty to the cause is more important than their loyalty to their children, whom they claim is the reason for their change. They have given away their children, sometimes to utter strangers rather than face the courts for their actions. Whether it is the all powerful state communism of USSR or Communist China or the revolutionary communism of the Weather Underground, there can be no bond stronger than the cause--even a parent's bond to his or her child.",1396137600,3,5335,4.904761904761905

5587092,3,B00BEIYKX0,"It is a bit hard to write about the story of this kind of thriller without spoiling it. For those who do not wish to know what the film is like too much, all I can say is that The Company You Keep stars Robert Redford (who also directs) as Jim Grant, a respectable lawyer and single father, whose past as a radical activist catches up when a resourceful newspaper reporter Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf) starts investigating about him.

After a promising start involving a real-life group Weather Underground and its activities about 30-40 years ago, Redford maintains a measured pace throughout in this character-driven thriller. Though he masterfully controls the pace and tension, what is revealed in the end is not as interesting as the complex moral questions the film raises, or questions that the film, steeped in nostalgia more than necessary, seems to forget as the story unfolds.

The Company You Keep doesn't have a single car chase or gun fight, but it does have an impressive cast: Julie Christie, Chris Cooper, Sam Elliott, Brendan Gleeson, Terrence Howard, Richard Jenkins, Anna Kendrick, Brit Marling, Nick Nolte, Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci. With this cast and subject matter, the film could have been a much more compelling drama, which The Company You Keep almost is.",1394236800,,1287,4.953703703703703

5587223,1,B00BEIYKX0,"First off, a roster of some of the most incredible actors make this movie appealing.  The first hour, you might be able to suspend belief about Robert Redford having a 12 year old daughter because, lets face it, Viagra has changed the parental landscape.  That said, when we move past the first hour and find that a couple in their 70's, that were activists in the 1970's, had a daughter, who is in her.........20's??!!  OK, using fingers and toes, 1972 to 2012 is.......not 20, or 30, but 40!  I guess as much as Susan Sarandon likes to distance herself from it, she once again signed on to do the ""Time Warp"" from Rocky Horror!!  Audiences are happy to go with along with a great story with great actors.

5587225,4,B00BEIYKX0,"The Company You Keep is about passion.
When young they had a passion for idealism, a dream they could change the world. They had to act on it because they could not stand by uninvolved, emotionless. It ended badly, in a way rational behavior never could. It was so typical of youth to think they could stand up against The Machine and have an effect. When the mild actions didn't work, they took the next step until they reached the logical absurdity, a precipice.
Then it all fell apart, as did they and gathered up the pieces as best they could by taking on different names and lives. This was also passion, the will to survive, the need to be free. Sort of.
Their past had taken innocent freedom away replacing it with deceitful coexistence with circumstances. This reality is something they would not consider agreeing with before the tragic event - compromise.
Passion has little use for compromise. It demands full commitment and anything else is unacceptable. Yet Nick and Mimi did compromise before that event.
They gave up their child, the offspring of another passion. It was a sacrifice they felt the movement demanded so they never questioned it. How ironic.
Thirty years later we see a different story. Like Nick said, they grew up. It was easy to be wild and idealistic about world events when there aren't bills to be paid and children to be taken care of. Now they did become their parents, an anathema in their youth, by leading lives inconceivable back when the world needed changing.
A soft, normal middle class life is what they aspire to now, a passion to raise a family and become normal, bland. Not so much a flaming, wild desire but a quiet way of life which in it's own way requires a slow burning passion.
It is within these circumstances this story starts. Even the youth in this generation shows it's passion. The reporter who digs and prods, pursuing with dogged determination to find the truth, to tell the story. Because of his dedication, he takes advantage of a break in the 30 year dam and opens the floodgates to the chagrin of the FBI who are just on the job.
He was on a mission and they were dutifully following leads, procedures, protocol but mostly following him, knowing he could lead them to Nick. So in end, Nick has to what is needed so he can return to something he originally gave up: raising a child.
The emotions of the movie are better than the story. The script was written well as illustrated by the reporter's repartee with Susan Sarandon during the interview and much later with Nick trying to convince Mimi to give herself up.
The integrity of the story, though is shaky. But we pass over the thinner portions of the plot and are enamored by the energy derived by strong human emotions. The concept of the message is the strongest motivation to enjoy it. 3 stars out of 4 on a good day when emotions are running high.",1389571200,,2871,4.576699029126214
5587226,5,B00BEIYKX0,"This film is gold.  The editing is slyly fast-paced, the message is never impaired--from the Sharon Solarz monologue to the closing exchange between Mimi Lurie and Nick Sloane.  The issues for the 60s generation were painful and Redford rightfully perceives still burning today.  Don't know whether one would say the cast is type cast, but Redford gets life-piercing performances from each of them, including the remarkable 11-yr old playing his daughter, the young reporter Ben Shepherd, and even the FBI lead investigator.  The lines between the still underground Weather Underground guiding Sloane's run to extricate himself from a bank killing several lives' past are pinging throughout, though never shouted.  It TAKEs multiple viewing to harvest all that's there, as they're smartly integrated into the warp and woof of the action.

I've watched the film more times than I dare count, and never tire of it.  I gave it to everyone for Christmas.

It's an excellent film with a terrific cast.  The storylines are interesting, and not predictable.  It raises a number of social issues.  For those who remember the times, it will bring back memories of a time compressed by a number of events which coalesced to define a generation.

It is an excellent and believable characterization of the Weather Underground and affiliated groups during the 60's and 70's, a time when I came of age and which I vividly remember.  I felt this was an excellent low-key thriller and really poignant in certain scenes.  The characterizations were spot on, especially Robert Redford, Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon and Sam Elliott.  The film did get a little draggy in parts and the ending was not as effective as one would like, but it handled a large and talented cast well and made me totally nostalgic for the days when social and political issues were vitally important to thinking people.  Certainly, it beats an era in which political dissent and social activism have to compete with home entertainment centers, tweets, and the constant bread and circuses stream of mindless entertainment that is now the opiate of the masses.

There was so much that could have been said about the motivations of the Weathermen, about the sixties and the Nixon government -- and then, ways in which the parallel drawn - of  that climate to our current surveillance state and growing citizen rage is mounting.  I had expected, given the excellent cast, that such a connection would be made, and that it would have been a statement about the war-mongering, the militarized police force, the paranoia of a government guilty of over-reaching that has returned multifold to America.  I had hoped, too, for some kind of fuller arc for the young journalist character - and there was none.  It was a waste of an excellent cast, and of a provocative situation which could have been used to illuminate our current state of affairs in a way that worked as a call to action, through the young journalist character  Disappointing that so much potential was wasted -- and perhaps a sorry statement of the fearfulness of the time in which we live, that such a statement was NOT made.

5587592,5,B00BEIYKX0,"I had to give it 5 Stars because it is a well done film. And Shia Labeouf is really very good as the hungry-for-success reporter at a local paper who wants to get to the New York Times as soon as possible. The way he goes after the story about Redford's character is really quite thrilling. It makes the movie. It's worth seeing just to see him.

But the story starts to fall apart when the radical Weathermen start talking. Susan Sarandon, who makes 60 look good, goes on about genocide while at the same time her character is guilty of murder.

Same thing with Julie Christie who makes 70 look bad. She's actually a bit frail and decrepit and not convincing at all. Her scene with Redford towards the end is loaded with not believeable dialogue. She still believes she can make a difference, she says. But her whole life after murdering the security guard has been devoted to selling drugs. So not sure what difference she was making there.

None of the characters have accomplished anything. Unlike the security guard they've murdered, they've gone on to live quiet, nice upper-middle class lives, raising their children in the safe confines of American suburbs.

The best line in the film is delivered by an FBI agent played by Anna Kendrick when she tells Shia Labeouf ""Terrorists justify terrorism"" And that's exactly what Sarandon's and Christie's characters do in their rambling speeches about genocide and war crimes. Redford's character is innocent of killing the security guard at the bank and he sees things from the guard's family's viewpoint--a husband and father was murdered.

Every Baby Boomer knows that groups like the Weathermen were populated with sociopaths, and that the real reason for the student protests were the draft, not the war. President Nixon, unlike President Johnson, knew it, too. Which is why Nixon got rid of it. Once the draft ended, so too did the protests.

This film gives the characters a chance to regurgitate the claim that the Weathermen bombings were all about revolution against the bad U.S. Government and not really about robbing banks and murdering innocent people. But they're saying these things as old hippies now, and they don't appear to have matured or learned anything about life in the 30-plus years since they committed their crimes.

It's worth watching but I don't recommend buying it. I rented it at Redbox, and Netflix has it.",1382832000,,2390,4.857493857493857
5587593,3,B00BEIYKX0,"This movie is almost a glorification of the Weather Underground. A group of misguided terrorist. What made up a bit for it was the  acting of Shia LaBeouf, which was extremely good. I found it fascinating his efforts to get the story. I think he saved the movie.

** Spoilers alert ***

Overall, I doubt a long term revolutionary, now a drug dealer would turn herself in order to save a former love long ago. I also doubt that her confession would save Redford. The prosecutor would have heaps of charges against Redford.",1382745600,,550,4.581632653061225

A slew of A-list actors or previously A-list actors like Robert Redford, Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon, Nick Nolte, Chris Cooper, Terence Howard, Stanley Tucci, Anna Kendrick and Sam Elliott flocked to this film for some reason, but what that was is the biggest mystery of the film.

The pacing is droll and slow. That is hands down the biggest problem of the film. I won't even go into the suspension of belief ages of some of the actors. Forty-five minutes into the film and I could care less about any of the over-acting and over-dramatizations. A scene in a truck between Nick Nolte and Redford was reminiscent of a scene from ""JFK"" as the character begins to remember and tell what they know about the past and it just felt trumped up and overdone. They wanted you to listen and observe with awe, but it just didn't work.

That scene is a fair assessment of the entire film. As much as they want you to care, it is just plain hard to. I don't know if its the pacing of the film or the obviously over-zealous attempt to make you care, but regardless, I didn't.",1381708800,,1317,4.529411764705882

5587811,2,B00BEIYKX0,"I watched this movie in a transatlantic flight, by default, twice too, because the other movies offered were so much worse, that I could not even get past their first ten minutes.
However, the movie is shallow and is a form of repentance offering to America by real life people(Redford, Christie, Nolte etc.) who posed (and were marketed) as lukewarm reactionaries and would-be revolutionaries in the sixties, and then went on to become rich and comfortable, selling themselves to American or America-related audiences and becoming members of the establishment. A big turn-off was Redford's age as many other reviewers commented, and also the too-evident cosmetic work on him and Christie. If Redford ever reads this, one suggestion: Color your sideburns just like the rest of your hair. It is the better alternative. It would not look more natural, but it would sure look more normal.
Anyway, the sixties deserve better than what the movie offers.
Another big turnoff was the obvious promotion of young and hopeful mega-stars-to-be, like Shia le Boeuf and that girl who plays his contact at the prosecutor's office. This is standard Hollywood practice, finding insignificant and mediocre-talented young actors and flanking them by old and proven talents, in the hopes of launching them to permanent stardom. Le Boeuf is one such droopy-shouldered actor, marketed as a latter day Dustin Hoffman; despite big parts in the last Indiana Jones and Wall Street II, Le Boeuf's career stubbornly resists taking off. Same with Ben Affleck.

The movie lacks spunk and corkiness; the whole time I was wondering whether a better way could be found to tell that story than all the yound actors doing the relaxed and physically unchallenging scenes and the old timers doing all the physically demanding action parts.

The movie is less than mediocre, but compared to all the trash that Hollywood has been producing for a long time now, if you have to see a movie, you can see this one. At least you will be able to watch it to the end.",1380412800,2,2022,4.961651917404129

I just don't buy into the idea that Julia Christie's character would have a change of heart and make everything all right by turning herself in.  Why didn't they just let Christie's character get away. This would force Redford to go on the run and lose his daughter.  Also, the arrogant johnny-come-lately FBI agent played by Terrence Howard is the villain of the story in my opinion.  So I found it kind of unsatisfying that he ""won"" in the end.  Instead of trying to satisfy us with a ""happy"" ending that reunites Redford with his daughter why not give us some pleasure at seeing Howards character ""lose"" in one way or another.

Grant suddenly finds that he has to disappear after Ben Shepard, (Shia La Beof,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Dark-Of-The-Moon/dp/B005QYKD4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers: Dark Of The Moon </a>), ambitious young reporter for the local ""Albany Sun-Times,"" identifies him as a long-sought U.S. terrorist. ""Grant"" - really Nick Sloan -- is apparently a member of the late 1960's-`70s group, the Weather Underground; he apparently took part in a 1970 bank robbery during which the bank's security officer was killed.  Grant/Sloan hits the road, with the journalist in hot pursuit; as Grant/Sloan looks up his old contacts, played by a slew of senior citizen stars, his guilt begins to appear less certain to the young man.

The mystery/suspense picture was written by Lem Dobbs, based on a novel by Neil Gordon.  In it, Susan Sarandon,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Client/dp/B001AIW3FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Client</a>),  plays Sharon Solarz, long-time housewife, another former member of the Weather Underground implicated in the bank robbery, whose decision to surrender herself starts the ball rolling.  Julie Christie, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Zhivago/dp/B001EC0OMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Zhivago</a>),  plays Mimi Lurie, Grant/Sloan's once, and possibly again, love.  Nick Nolte, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Thief/dp/B00009WVT3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Thief</a>), plays Donal Fitzgerald; Chris Cooper, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breach/dp/B000RVP7YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breach</a>), Daniel Sloan, Nick's brother.  Terrence Howard,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hustle-Flow/dp/B000I52LVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hustle & Flow</a>), is FBI Agent Cornelius; Stanley Tucci, Ray Fuller; Richard Jenkins, Jed Lewis.  Brendan Gleeson,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B001D23BFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>), is police chief Henry Osborne, who investigated the bank robbery; Sam Elliott, Mac McLeod; Stephen Root, Billy Cusimano.  Anna Kendrick is the journalist's friend, young FBI agent Diana; Brit Marling, Rebecca Osborne; Jackie Evancho, Isabel Grant, Grant/Sloan's 11 year old daughter.

The film, like many of those directed by Redford, is slow-moving and kind of clunky.  More bothersome to me is the fact that the film's numbers don't add up.  I am old enough to remember the events upon which the underlying novel is based, when several members of the Weather Underground surrendered themselves:  in the 1980s.  When people say that Grant/Sloan, or Solarz have lived in hiding for 30 years, well, 1970 and 30 is 2000, not 2012.  Despite Director Redford's efforts to show us Actor Redford running in a limber fashion, Redford is clearly at least in his 70s.  And very few men in their 70s, with the possible exception of Cary Grant, have ever had 11 year old daughters.  For that matter, very few men in their 70s have ever had daughters in their visibly mid-twenties, as is Grant/Sloan's daughter with Lurie.  And we are told that this daughter, who looks mid-twenties and is going back to higher education, was born in 1970 or thereabouts.  Folks, she would now be in her mid-forties, probably a bit long in the tooth to be returning to higher education.  Most interestingly, an early, brief scene in the movie hints that at one time, Redford and Co. were going to place the film more accurately in time.  On her way to surrender, Solarz drives into New York State, and stops to gas up.  She stops at an ""Esso"" station, where she is arrested.  ""Esso"" changed its name to ""Exxon"" in 1973.  I doubt you could find an Esso station anywhere in the United States or Canada today.

Of course, if the movie were set in its accurate time frame, today's Redford could not star.  Nor could he employ all those semi-retired actors, many of whom, I'm sure, many viewers will welcome.  And many viewers may think that at least the heart of this political thriller is in the right place.  As for me, I've a soft spot for Albany, New York and its environs; that gave the picture an extra star in my numbers.",1380067200,,4896,6.579439252336448

He could see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Now, he had to prove he wasn't involved in the bank robbery the Group committed, which caused the death of the guard at the bank.

I loved the movie.  It kept you interested from the beginning to the end.  I remembered the real group back in the late 60's, which made it more interesting.  I believe this is the same Underground Group that involved Patti Hearst back then.

It was unfortunate that the bank guard was killed, because I do not think the young group intended for anyone to get hurt.  They had good intentions in the beginning and were trying to influence the ending of the horrific Vietnam War.",1379116800,2,990,4.403314917127072

5588007,4,B00BEIYKX0,"Robert Redford directs himself and an all-star cast of aging superstars in addition to some up-and-comers in this run and hide thriller.  Redford plays Jim Grant, an attorney in Albany, New York.  Thirty years earlier he was a member of the Weather Underground Movement, a real organization bent on terrorism to protest the Vietnam War and harsh government tactics on more peaceful protests.  In this fictional story, he was allegedly involved in a Michigan bank robbery where a security officer was killed.  He, along with 3 others have been on the lam since.

The first to get caught is Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) even though she was about to surrender.  Why?  Can't give that away.  Grant aka Nick Sloan, realizes that it's just a matter of time so he hands off his 11 year old daughter (mom died in a car wreck) to his brother (Chris Cooper) in NYC and heads for the scene of the crime (Michigan).  Grant's eventual discovery came from a hungry local newspaper reporter, Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf) who suspects there is more to the story.  He can't figure out why the daughter was left behind.

Along the way Grant runs into former ""soldiers"" in the movement played by Nick Nolte, Richard Jenkins (11 years younger than Redford, but OK), Stephen Root & Sam Elliott.  They are just there for a brief walk-on and to direct Grant to the person he really wants to see, Mimi (Julie Christie), one of the kingpins in the old organization and one time lover.  Eventually they reunite in Ann Arbor (Mimi's hometown) where Grant tries to get her to come clean.  I found this gambit a bit of a stretch, but it has a necessary purpose for an obvious plot twist.

Brendan Gleeson plays the police detective who handled the bank robbery and Brit Marling plays his law student daughter.  She's along for the ride and as an age appropriate counter to Ben's investigative reporter.  Stanley Tucci is Ben's editor, Terrence Howard is the hard assed FBI task leader and Anna Kendrick is an FBI agent who is a bit loose with confidential info, just because she and Ben had a fling in college.

The film has some interesting twists and turns and Ben eventually unravels the truth.  There are some problems however.  Some are just logistical silliness in terms of travel and transportation.  The movie is about 20 minutes too long, mostly due to Redford's insistence of scenes of him and Christie jogging through the woods.  Yeah, we get it, you guys are in great shape for your age.  The film is a nice puzzle and it's nice to see the old pros still at work.

The 35mm film transfers well to Blu ray with its 1080p resolution 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It retains a hint of grain which certainly enhances the film feel as well as all of the good aspects of digital.  Skin tones (and a lot of wrinkles) are well detailed and color perfect.  There are no discernible issues that I can see.  The movie is dialog focused but does use the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track often enough to be helpful.  Helicopters flying around, sirens blaring get the attention of the surround speakers.  English SDH subtitles are included.  Here are the extras:

5588088,3,B00BEIYKX0,"This might have been a good movie rather than a tolerable one if....

Redford had not played the lead.  There was something amiss about a man his age (He is a year younger than I am)..that is, mid-70's, playing the father of a ten year old.  Maybe as the grandfather.  His direction is keen but his movies are always better with out him in them.  Although he is often good in other movies where he is not miscast.

Also if...things had moved at a somewhat faster pace..and more suspenseful.  We were in the dark as to why he was after Mimi (Julie Christie) after all of those years but only got vague glimpses of the why's and when we found out the why somehow there was only a mild surprise and disappointment. The ending failed to surprise although Christie was very convincing as she expressed what she would not do and then, of course, ended up doing it.  hmmmmm

I lived through the Viet Nam war and the protesting that went on. I was an adult then and a history teacher.  And, having said that, I do believe that it is a story well worth telling and should never remain limited to an objective historical only viewpoint.  Many people were very opposed to our involvement in Viet Nam because of the many lives lost and some of them got militantly violent about it.  In retrospect something gets lost in the telling, the mood which prevailed is missed.  And Redford did just that--missed it.  But, hey, laurels for trying!

It did not bring it all back.  It just misfired the meaning.  Okay to watch some afternoon when you want to see how Nick Nolte, Julie Christie, and Robert Redford are looking these days.  Richard Jenkins was just right, btw, and worth a rental just to watch his short part in it.  Again, he shines up against much more famous names which he also did with Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love.

We are all getting older and it is bittersweet to view great actors we have loved over the years share their craft with us but made me sad to see that while I am getting old,

5588416,3,B00BEIYKX0,"In a sense ""The Company You Keep"" is a testament to Robert Redford's skill as a director.  I can't think of too many films that would get your attention as this one does despite the missteps and stretches of logic on display.  For starters the film is apparently set thirty years after the campus uprisings of the late Sixties and early Seventies.  By that account the setting of the film would be around the beginning of the new Millennium yet references are made to Facebook which wasn't created until much later in the decade.  We also have to accept Senior Citizens like Robert Redford, Julie Christie, and Nick Nolte as Fiftysomethings.  At least they didn't make Chris Cooper Redford's older brother.  It's interesting that journalist Ben Shepard(Shia LaBoeuf) is a complete parasitic weasel so distasteful even his own editor dislikes him.  In the Seventies Redford made films like ""All the President's Men"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" that elevated to sainthood the print media.  For a film that concerns itself with the former Students for Democratic Action and the Weather Underground I came away with very little insight into these organizations and what made their members tick with the possible exception of one scene with Susan Sarandon who plays a repenting fugitive.  The depiction of the leader of the former militants, Nick Sloan (Redford) doesn't help matters.  Whether it's in the way the character is written or the way Redford portrays him Sloan remains an enigma.  The end of the film which should provide answers only adds new questions.  Despite these criticisms ""The Company You Keep"" is an eminently watchable film that moves at a nice clip with some good performances.  The manhunt for Sloan is exciting and tense.  Be prepared for the potholes ,or ,plot holes for that matter, however.",1377216000,3,1817,4.973509933774834

But, wow.

When I saw that this deeply emotional, touching, thriller features so many preeminent American actors from the relevant age group - yeah, some are also movie stars, but we're talking *actors* here - I got ready for an amazing ride. And I wasn't disappointed.

Every moment with these admirable, iconic performers was priceless- Susan Sarandon, Chris Cooper, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Jenkins, Stanley Tucci ... even Julie Christie, though even with Zhivago I didn't really understand her popularity. I suspect it's a guy thing. And I've never understood complaints about Redford's Great Stone Face. If people don't eat their words after watching his scenes with his young daughter, and his former lover, I'll be amazed.

And if Susan Sarandon doesn't get an Academy Award nomination for her performance, I'll be astounded.",1377043200,5,1063,5.057142857142857
5588419,4,B00BEIYKX0,"This was an interesting movie with a lot of well known actors on board for this production.  While the movie kept a steady and interesting pace- the ending was a bit lackluster.  Yet, I wasn't sure what a fitting ending would actually be, so I can't complain too much about how it closes.

Based on a real radical peace movement organization in the past, an org that wanted Vietnam over and soldiers brought home, somewhere along the way the group started to realize that their passive protests were not quite enough.

This frustrated them more and obviously angered certain members of the group into actions they normally would not do.

At least this is how some members of the groups felt, and  it seems the protests gradually got more aggressive until one day, an innocent person is killed in a bank robbery.

The movie analyzes  both the cause and the people involved, with Robert Redford's character the focal point of the movie as it explores these issues.

A key point to the movie is that things are not what they appear to be, and also, people learn that time has a way of changing perception and beliefs about their prior and present behavior.

Shia Lebouf is a young, tenacious, investigative reporter who wants to grab a good story and make a name for himself.

And not just something for his small time newspaper, but something that will let him make his  mark in the world of journalism in general.

He thinks if he can learn more about this group from 30 years ago and where the former members are, what they are doing, how they are linked- etc, and create a block buster story- even an expose', he will be giving his career in journalism, a major boost from a lame local newspaper to something bigger and  better- whatever that might be.

When Susan Sarandon's character- the woman from 30 years ago who is guilty of being involved in shooting an innocent bystander in a bank, finally decides it is time to turn herself in, the FBI grabs her before she can do so of her own volition.

Shia Lebouf is intrigued by the story of THE WEATHERMEN, as the group was called, and by Sarandon's character.

She allows him to interview her if he promises to simply report the truth. Or at least the truth as she saw it back then.

This seems to cause further  intrigue  for Lebouf after interviewing her at the police station.

He now sees her as a far more complex character than just some hippie from the past who went out of control and did something unspeakable and indefensible.

 He seeks out on a journey of putting the puzzles together of  several people, who were once the same age he was , fighting for what they believed in  decades ago, until something went terribly wrong.

As he goes about doing this, he sets a chain of events in motion that ends up getting many of the former group under the spotlight of the FBI.

He also  ends up potentially putting innocent people into jeopardy in his zeal to cover this juicy, history making  story.

  As the movie moves on, Lebouf's character must weigh the consequences of a hot story hitting the press with his name on it- versus the collateral damage to those who had nothing to do with the org or that fateful day so long ago.

The movie is based on a novel but the org did actually exist and I intend to learn more about them and what became of them.

  Most people agree today what a terrible waste of lives the Vietnam war caused and how fruitless the entire conflict was.

 Some people in the past tried earnestly to be a voice for the American people against the war and  use that voice to bring American troops home.

But they were drowned out and the movie shows old video flashbacks of how protesters against the war were treated.  The American govt and military had no hesitation in doing whatever it could to squelch movements like THE WEATHERMEN.  The police/ MP brutality shown in flashbacks makes you realize how so many of these protests were well intentioned but never stood a chance.

When you see how martial law was used against such people,and you hear references as well to the KENT STATE incident, one can understand how certain members of this group might have went over the edge and crossed a very serious line in their effort to try and put an end to the atrocities they were so very aware of happening to Vietnam's people and our own soldiers.

They wanted their voices to be heard louder. Unfortunately, some poor choice of methods were employed. They crossed the line from being outrageous and not hurting people to having a person murdered.

That fine line, is one that was crossed- but the  movie leaves you guessing who crossed that line along with Susan Sarandon's character.

 Susan is not a fall guy- she is guilty.  She does not deny that.

 But there is another accomplice in this bank robbery scenario and apparently there is a fall guy as well.

The question the movie pursues right up to the very end is: who else was culpable in that bank robbery incident and who might not be involved at all?",1376956800,7,4997,4.520089285714286

She tries to tell her story of the Weather Underground, but an FBI agent, played by Anna Kendrick thinks it is all bull. In other arenas other members if the underground are being hunted. Nick Nolte and Julie Christie, old friends of Redford's character are trying to run and hide as he is. People pop up, old friends and lovers, lots of big names in acting, Chris Cooper, Stanley Tucci, Sam Elliott, and Terrence Howard. To no end the film doesn't really work. The story is old and these over the top actors make it feel too pretentious.

Nick seems to outfox everyone.  Too many sloppy side stories. And, I am sorry, but these people are too old to play Weatherman. This story should have been told twenty years ago.

5588445,4,B00BEIYKX0,"THE COMPANY YOU KEEP began as a novel by Neil Gordon, was transformed into a screenplay by Lem Dobbs, and produced, directed and stars Robert Redford. The highly respected Redford is likely the reason that so many luminaries aligned with this project: the cast includes four actors (Robert Redford, Susan Sarandon, Chris Cooper and Julie Christie) who have won Academy Awards and five others (Anna Kendrick, Richard Jenkins, Nick Nolte, Terrence Howard and Stanley Tucci) who have been nominated for Academy Awards, and the number of important actors doesn't stop there. The film is about a time in history (the1960s when many of us were either reluctantly in Vietnam or in the streets in the US protesting that very wrong war) that makes it very easy to want to empathize with the story, but despite some very fine moments and some excellent isolated scenes, the film is shaky and predictable and gets caught up in its own sense of righteousness. And that is unfortunate.

According to the officially release synopsis, `Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandan) is nervous. She is driving along a lonely road, lost in thought. As she goes over a hill, her car drifts a little too close to the center-divide and she almost crushed by a truck going in the opposite direction. Rattled further, she pulls into a gas station. She looks like any another woman until cars come screeching in all around her, FBI agents begin waving their badges and a shotgun is pointed at her head. Jim Grant (Robert Redford)  has made a good life for himself as a small town lawyer in Albany New York. He has managed to juggle his job and raise his 11-year-old daughter Isabel (Jacqueline Evancho) after the death of his wife a few years ago. His world is turned upside down after he's approached by his old friend Billy (Stephen Root) while dropping his daughter off at school. Billy fills Jim in on Sharon's arrest that took place not far from them. Billy asks if Jim will help her in any way, but Jim wants no part of it. We learn that Sharon was a former member of a radical group called the Weather Underground. The group robbed a bank way back in the late 70s and the security guard, an off duty policeman, was shot and killed in the process. Sharon has been charged with murder. Jim is suddenly under suspicion of somehow being involved. During the ensuing investigation, evidence is unearthed and connections are being made, namely by young and clever Albany Times reporter Ben Schulberg (Shia LaBeouf). Ben uses his local and FBI contacts and slowly begins to think that Jim was involved in the robbery and murder. But past appearances can be deceiving and as he tries to get to the bottom of it all, Jim leads Ben and the FBI on a cross-country manhunt, while trying to find the third remaining member-at-large, Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie), so that he might convince her to come forward and prove his innocence and save his daughter.' To connect more dots would be a disservice to the viewer.

In small but strong rolls are such fine actors as Chris Cooper, Terrence Howard, Stanley Tucci, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Elliott, Anna Kendrick, Richard Jenkins, Brit Marling, and Nick Nolte. Everyone tries to make this a suspense thriller, but too much is known form the outset that breaks the thread of tension. Worth seeing, especially if you were active in the 60s, but not a great movie despite all the talent. Grady Harp, August 13",1376524800,3,3404,4.736930860033727

First off, THE COMPANY YOU KEEP is by no means a ""thriller."" There is nothing in the way of fast action, not a shred of violence, no harrowing chase scenes, etc. The pacing throughout is slow yet steady. The first three-quarters of the film are simultaneously engaging and ho-hum. I kept hoping that it would somehow pay off, and it does. The subtle threads come together, and there are some true surprises. By ""true surprises,"" I do not mean anything earth-shattering, just, well, truly surprising. THE COMPANY YOU KEEP quietly touches on a lot of themes, but in the end it's more about the camaraderie (as well as suspicion) that endures between old friends/conspirators than it is about what's happening with all of them in the here and now.

Redford gives a nice performance as Jim Grant/Nick Sloan, but Shia LaBeouf steals the show as idiosyncratic reporter Ben Shepard. Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon, Brendan Gleeson,and most of the rest of the cast under-act; still, the under-acting is oddly effective and in keeping with the other minimalistic elements of this film.

Several plotholes and too-easies that will hopefully not be too ruinous if you are willing and able to suspend disbelief. THE COMPANY YOU KEEP might also have been enhanced by more in the way of flashback(s) to the big event back in the '70s that brought about everything that's happening in the present.

THE COMPANY YOU KEEP may leave you wondering who the real criminals, both within the film and elsewhere, are. I've never seen anything quite like this, and I'm not sure why I like it as much as I do. But I do.

5588449,5,B00BEIYKX0,"as one who was in in the ""undergound"" - I'll let u figure our how...the movie was gripping altho a bit preposterous in the- all get together at the cabin part...I will get the book.
Notes - Christie's speech in the cabin- about how things are worse is certainly true. The country has ossified into endless war- protest, like the Plowshares are not covered- the media is entirely bought and sold, the romney 2 % rules and makes the rules! The US kills many- and many civilians- every day! War criminals are in power- Bradley Manning sits in prison.
 Journalism is not really presented well in the movie- for- journalism these days has sold out- but for a few.
In the 60's we had Liberation News Service, underground newspapers.
Thus revolution is still necessary...but violence? Would be a custeristic, self defeating tactic now. Is it always? The Weatherpeople went up to the abyss and peered in- Baader Meinhof jumped in!

Violence to persons is self defeating- but destruction of property? Some property has no right to exist.

The movie brings to mind real people- Gilbert, Boudin, Wilkerson, Whitehorn, Hearst, etc. Get their books- which the media cannot and will not cover. See the play- ""Something You Did"".
Unfortunately, the Redford character's redemption is presented as sort of a family thing. Actually- coninual struggle- especially non violent, civilly disobedient, radical action and protest is redemption.
But the movie poses the great question- what are you willing to take a risk for?",1376352000,,1501,4.996

5588451,3,B00BEIYKX0,"As much as I respect Robert Redford as an actor, director and founder of the Sundance Institute, I just find him too hard to swallow as the father of an 11-year-old girl, especially the one played so precociously here by singing prodigy Jackie Evancho. This is one of several perceptible discrepancies that kept me from becoming fully engrossed in this fitfully suspenseful 2013 political thriller. At 76, he still looks great for his age and has a long legacy of starring in similarly themed movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-The-President-s-Men/dp/B000I3U2WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All The President's Men</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/B0036G1T78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Days of the Condor</a>, but our suspension of belief is put to the test when we are expected to believe that his character, a small-town lawyer named Jim Grant, turns out to be Nick Sloan, a former 1970's radical who would have been a fearless political agitator in his forties. While I believe it's never too late for anyone to start their lives over, there is an air of vanity in Redford's self-selection since he is also the director. Fortunately in that role, he shows his unerring professionalism and keeps the pacing tight despite the convolutions brought on by Lem Dobbs' screenplay.

The story begins when a middle-aged woman is suddenly arrested at a suburban gas station. Her real identity is Sharon Solarz, a former anti-Vietnam War radical who has been hiding in Canada under an alias for all these years. She makes one of her allowable calls to Grant, who becomes a person of interest for an intrepid newspaper reporter looking for his big break. Grant knows it's a matter of time before the FBI starts looking for him and goes on the lam, leaving his confused young daughter with his long-estranged brother. As Sloan, he is accused of participating with Solarz in a bank robbery that left a security guard dead. His former paramour Mimi Lurie is the only one who can prove his innocence, but she's in hiding as well and far less repentant about her radical activities. What follows is a series of encounters a bedraggled Sloan has with several former Weather Underground comrades. Each of them greets Sloan with different degrees of emotion depending on how they have carried on with their lives in the interim.

At the same time, Redford and Dobbs want to make a point of showing how history appears to be repeating itself with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and pointing to the role of current tabloid-style journalism in fanning the embers in an irresponsible way. The movie ends up simplifying its points by turning the story into a morality play where key characters have to decide when to take a stand and when to concede if there is something even bigger to consider than political convictions. Beyond Redford's craggy presence, there is a starry mix of old and new faces that make the cross-generational casting appear even more pronounced. Julie Christie as Lurie, Susan Sarandon as Solarz, and Richard Jenkins and a vocally challenged Nick Nolte as fellow ex-radicals all make welcome appearances in the story, though their roles feel somewhat truncated. Shia LaBoeuf plays the reporter with his usual veneer of smarminess, but Brit Marling and Anna Kendrick lend surprising sharpness in small roles. Terrence Howard, Chris Cooper and Stanley Tucci fill in other supporting roles with aplomb.",1375660800,25,3547,5.389189189189189
5588452,4,B00BEIYKX0,"This movie is nice. I'd say that much. Having been on something of a Redford-rampage lately i'd venture to say that it is a nice continuation on themes that have appeared previously in his career as well.
The basic plotline, fugitive, question of guilt, the chase, the potentiality of loss, the detective, the old network. All aspects that work nicely together and is done in a respectful manner. Old secrets come to light at an amicable pace, and the movie manages to make at least certain reveals not completely obvious.

The inevitability of Redfords character's redemption makes the movie lack a little nerve though. In the end it boils down to ""conformist dad gets redemption and evil ideologue goes to jail, whilst intrepid journalist learns a lesson about why to keep secrets"". Because all we want is a happy family life right, so please just shut up already. Which should be expected for this kind of movie, and which, dealing with the topic at hand is strictly speaking necessary for the movie to be in any way publishable.

Fair enough, even with irritants as mentioned above it was an emotionally moving film that dealt with an aspect of american history worthy of attention.",1374624000,,1186,4.83743842364532
5588453,5,B00BEIYKX0,"Redford has scored again with the intense, thought provoking, elegant, refined, contained film that is ""The Company you Keep"", an instant classic, for many diverse reasons, and, especially,when i think what's out there in Cinemas these days, i know for sure that this must be
 one of the most deserving movies of the year! Even though, it was made and had even premiered in 2012, the film officially came out in theaters in the US, in the late Spring of 2013, and, so it is definitely this year's film!
And, maybe it is not the absolute masterpiece i was hoping for, but, despite some annoying mixed buzz, originated mostly by some of the incoherent web press (all major paper's reviews from the New York Times to the Los Angeles Times, and, from Variety to the Hollywood Reporter,  from Time to People, and so forth, gave to the movie major accolades, like the European press did as well, when it premiered last Fall, at the prestigious Venice Film Festivals, winning 2 Awards) and, by a mistake in marketing it so toughly as a political thriller, when instead, in my opinion, ""The Company you Keep"" is truly and clearly, instead, a political drama! And a political drama starring great, some even sensational actors! What a cast! Who says that this cast was excessive must be a moron! Especially, again, during this horribly grim 2013 (i haven't found one film yet, i truly loved, beside this one, and, ""Only God Forgives"" from Nicolas Winding Refn!) we should just feel nothing but blessed, and, thankful instead to be able to go back to the theaters to actually watch a really well crafted movie,  and, a movie that is actually not about super heroes, or shabby remakes of old TV shows, but, for once, it is a movie about the people in America, with our diversities, and, complexities, seen as common, and, as they stand,  which is quite interestingly a fact we always almost escape from in movies, a reason that we try not to acknowledge, almost as if, it was a sin, to be.. human! And, romantic,too, and, to care for the past, and, for history, and, for a good moral lesson! All these things are instead very good,  and they truly are what makes this film always so moving and watchable, so simple, and, yet so profound, a good, very good film, indeed! Especially now, in this very historical moment what this film is about should matter to many, and, it should be showed to everyone, without tax exemption, since we live, and, deal in such a confused society, and, culture today, that truly anybody could only benefit from watching and carefully listening to this labor of love!
""The Company you Keep"" is in fact always never less than compelling, as it is so beautifully photographed, without any CGI or special effects, by the great Adriano Goldman, and, so intensely scored by the talent of Cliff Martinez (""Drive"", among others)),and, of course, superbly helmed, and, directed by Redford, from a script by Lem Dobbs, that could have maybe used a little more care in some of the layers evolving within  the story telling, and, at times, it could have been even a tiny tad more aggressive, making  so-perhaps- more powerful some moments, that in any case, at the end, still all come across very well, and, with that great sensibility, of which Redford has always been capable of, since his first wonderful directorial debut in 1981, ""Ordinary People"". Here, it almost feels like there was instead a particular attention  and intention to keep it low key, always trying to stay away carefully from the danger of possibly overstating some of these supporting characters: there was almost a will to make them as human, and, as flawed as possible, and, without gimmicks, or overly melodramatic tones or moods, but, at the contrary, with that same slightly somber clarity, and, stability, that people do truly gain when they grow older, and, they re-consider everything, even the highest ideals of their own lives themselves, in a more subtle and logical manner, with a more loving and less selfish approach to the situations, and, with a lot more instead of that noble sense of respect for others, like for example, even when, without wanting to compromise, at all, they still  find themselves to have to realistically ponder more about the consequences, and, more about those they love or have loved, those who are or who have been truly important, and, so worthy of being now  more respected, than any, of their own personal pride, or even, than their very own sense of justice! And, we must admire this very hard choice, this stand, that Redford has taken on the material, because it's not easy, but, actually very challenging to tell a story, by detracting from the momentum, and, still being able to so skillfully achieve a successful, and, personal execution, like in this very case!
But, again, even though, in a few moments, the film as a whole, could have used a little extra punch, let me tell you that with this cast, it was impossible not getting to a complete success!
And, it is successful because the representation of what the film is telling us come out at the end potent without apparently any huge efforts, or convoluted stylistic choices! Every actor, here, even for few minutes, like, for example Susan Sarandon, is able to leave an extraordinary impression, and, like in Sarandon's case,  to deliver within 2 scenes, some of the best work she's done in a very, very long time! And, beside, all the extraordinary stars, and, very well known character actors here involved, i must say that even all the younger people, like Anna Kendrick, for example, are able to stand out, in fact, even though, cast in a smallish role, she does here a terrific job, recreating to perfection her character, and, giving in very little screen time, even more than what she was possibly expected to so perfectly convey! And, if Shia La Beouf, plays here a very good antagonist to the much, much older lead, and, brings some acute perspectives to his character, directly taken from the people of his generation and their mentality, i must say that, over all,  the movie is very much for me, at the end, all about Redford and Julie Christie! They are truly wonderful together, two real wonderful stars, not afraid to look older, and, too look fatigued,and, proved by a challenging life, while, yet balking in their own real light, that certain light that comes actually from the inside and out (and that more than a few seem to have forgotten how to see and perceive, sadly!) bringing a wonderful sheer of true top notch star power, in both of their carefully delivered, still always extremely passionate and brilliant, truly brilliant, performances.
Again, for this, and, for a lot more, this movie, especially in 2013, should not be missed, and, hopefully considered strictly for the upcoming Awards season, next Fall! If this film is impeccable, it is also very much because of these people, its cast, i mean, being composed by so many, incredibly significative, and, unforgettably majestic people, capable to express enormous feelings, and, to twinkle vividly, even when standing in the afterglow!",1374105600,3,7106,4.8108108108108105

8567087,4,B00BEIYKX0,"Even BEFORE this movie was released in 2013, the press's talking heads had decided to pan this movie for political reasons. All they knew was the movie's topic and Redford's politics. I am conservative who is organically suspicious of the press and it's motives [and Redford's too]. I went to see it because I wanted to see a particular actor's performance. I AM CONVINCED THE PRESS MISSED THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE MOVIE.

This movie has a rare perspective. It covers the actions of politically active young adults living over many years, including years years beyond their activism. This long view theme is VERY well done. It bridges the gap between being an involved young adult and the ideological changes that come with finding one's niche in society. This long perspective leads to a realization that INDIVIDUALS change as much or more than the society in which we embed ourselves. Finally the honesty about ourselves we finally develop over time about the events of our past. An honesty that sees through the many ways we deceived even ourselves at the time. I know. My generation lived through this already.

I recommend this movie to all conservatives and all liberals and everyone in between.

This film does not glorify terrorism. Quite the opposite. It shows a person can find themselves having crossed the line from being an ""activist"" to being a felon/terrorist. The movie then becomes a retrospective of an activist's two lives  the first one given to them at birth that they have  to abandon, and the second life they had to build afterward. The focus of this movie becomes the private price THEY paid AND simultaneously PUSHED OFF ONTO loved ones to avoid paying the public price for THEIR OWN acts.

Sloan was guilty of some felony activities, but NOT the murder of the bank guard. His REAL crimes, if caught, were worth some jail time but not what was being asked of him.

This is a VERY tightly packed movie, hardly a word that isn't important to the development of the plot. Redford tries to make his point the ""old fashioned"" way, without car chases, gun battles and funny sidekicks. While this movie does need a bit more tension and rage at one particular point, that's ALMOST the biggest flaw I saw.

The biggest flaw in the movie is the concept that 76 YO Redford has an 11 YearOld [YO] daughter. This flaw springs from the fact that the movie would not be financed without 76 YO Redford as the boxoffice draw. Since Redford was 76, and his character was early 60s,  Timeline adjustments had to be made. Look past this flaw. The moral of this story is much too good to be lost in 'minutia'.

 By the way, this movie has a lot of great talent in it, and they each do very well for themselves and the presentation of the movie's moral. There are 14 class act performers, plus one. This would be a hard cast to play against, but ""plus one"" did a super job in her first movie role.",1529020800,144,2900,4.611650485436893

Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

Robert Redford has a secret: for the past thirty years, hes been living a lie. He was once part of the Weather Underground, but he changed his identity and has lived a peaceful life after deciding to distance himself from the militant group. Now, his former friend has been arrested for a decades-old crime and hes in danger of being arrested as an accomplice. So, he packs up his young daughter, the adorable Jackie Evancho, and flees!

Shia LaBeouf plays a young, upstart reporter who makes life difficult for Robert Redford, but as unlikable as Shia is, Bob is correspondingly likable. Bob is always trustworthy, and he and Jackie are very sweet together. Be on the lookout for dozens of familiar faces, who no doubt latched onto the casting notices for a chance to work with Redford, who also directed the film. Susan Sarandon, Julie Christie, Stanley Tucci, Nick Nolte, Chris Cooper, Richard Jenkins, Terrence Howard, Brendan Gleeson, and Sam Elliot make up the all-star cast.

If you liked Sneakers, but secretly hoped for a dramatic version, youll love The Company You Keep. This exciting flick is going to make you pay attention, and the many cameos, political message, thoughtful directing, and social commentary fit in with all the greatness youd expect out of a Robert Redford movie.",1506297600,,1361,4.908695652173913
