Viewers will find it funny and they well also get to see what it takes to survive at that level. Professional sports is not all glitz and glamor... Its hardwork, perseverance, and good breaks here and there.

I highly recommend watching this video!",1519603200,,366,4.71875
8405443,5,B000GYI20K,"Iconic! This film was incredibly before its time.  The subject of tbe documentary actively participates in its filming and interview's.  The concept of using a handheld to film a documentary may seem common place today, however in a documentarynin tge late 90's.... incredible",1499385600,,276,5.395348837209302
8405444,1,B000GYI20K,This is basically a self made home movie. It is terrible. A total waste of money. This is not professionally done. Do not buy this movie.,1446595200,,137,4.3076923076923075
8405445,3,B000GYI20K,"The film itself is a good look at the life that most people that call themselves professional players live. I didn't however like the angle that Mark Keil took. He often comes across as whiny and his why me? attitude is easy to hate. He admitted he hated practicing, admitted he likes to drink  and yet throughout the film he carries this whole ""poor me, why can't I be better attitude?  In any profession, if you don't work at improving you get stuck and others pass you by and that to me is what is upsetting about the film. He is complaining about the attention the top players get, the money they make and the comfortable life many make yet he complains.",1441238400,,658,4.385245901639344
8405446,5,B000GYI20K,"An interesting story of two tennis 'Journeymen, Mark and Geoff, who are trying to make enough money to stay on tour. Its great to see a movie told from this angle, not from the typical Im a star look at me usual bore fest. The movie shows the difference between being at the top of the tree to being pretty good, just not quite good enough to be a real super star.

The guys also get great access to some of tennis big name stars who are very candid, perhaps because they didn't think this movie would get made?

What makes the movie most enjoyable, like any good documentary, is that you start to feel an emotional connection to the people in the movie and you want them to succeed.

Tennis is overdue for another movie like this.",1388620800,,731,4.282608695652174
8405447,5,B000GYI20K,"I have seen several documentaries about the tennis pro tour over the years but this one is definitely the best so far.  These 2 players did a GREAT job giving us a behind the scenes look at how it is for the players who struggle to make it in tennis.  By the way,  I was laughing throughout most of this film.  GREAT WORK Mark and Geoff!",1213747200,,337,4.0606060606060606
8405448,5,B000GYI20K,"Other than the fact that he sells his fairly successful career a bit short, Mark Keil presents an extremely entertaining behind the scenes glimpse at the pro circuit and the struggle to hang on.  Mark is currently working with my son as his coach and has said many times, to make it on the tour you either have to be dirt poor and sponsored by someone, or filthy rich and bankrolled by your folks.  The odds of seeing another middle class champion down the road are very thin. This point seems to be well documented in this wonderful film.  He's a great guy, super coach and you need to check out his new column on Tennis Grandstand, at [..]",1203811200,,641,4.369747899159663
