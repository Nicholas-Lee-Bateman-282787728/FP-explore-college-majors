I have wanted to watch this show again for many years - I remember watching it with my family when it first aired and absolutely loved the whole premise then, as now. In the sanitized era of early sitcoms it was a bit quirky, but was a favorite of mine as a kid!  Enjoy.",1385856000,5,301,4.016666666666667
6061425,4,B00G5N6C8U,"This is a fun show. Family friendly, and kind of silly - but fun to watch and lots of laughs. It's supposed to be one of the worst shows ever produced for TV - I disagree. It's a bit of a time capsule - surreal; It's sort of like Mr. Ed except with a taking car.  The car talks - and the car happens to be inhabited by Dave's (Jerry Van Dyke's) dead mother. Remember, this was the 1960's. If you don't think too much about the logic or the psychology of it (after all, Dave drives around in the car - which happens to be his own mother), you'll enjoy it.

The set is packed in a card board box (Reminds me of the kind of box Christmas cards come in). Open the box and inside you'll find 2 standard shrink-wrapped DVD cases. Same cover art as the outer box. Volume 1 has three discs  - Volume 2 has two discs. Looks as if they were going to be sold as 2 separate sets, and just were packaged together in the cardboard box.",1385337600,14,921,3.994565217391304

6061427,5,B00G5N6C8U,"I can't wait to own the DVD of this 1965 classic sitcom :-) Maybe not the best written series but like the television sitcom, Mr. Ed (the talking horse), I long for this quirky show :-) My only complaint is with the artwork on the box!! The artwork selected does not represent this series well at all!! If I designed the artwork for this release, I would have had the 1929 Porter front and center, as Dave Crabtree was admiring his new car and his family in the background looking worried over dad's mental state :-) I have no idea who the man seated next to Jerry Van Dyke is?!?

6061428,3,B00G5N6C8U,"I was five years old when ""My Mother The Car"" originally aired.  Our family watched a lot of television in those days like ""Gidget"" and ""Lost In Space.""  My family must have passed on this show because I have absolutely no recollection of it. Reruns never surfaced on local television in Los Angeles during the seventies, but over the years I had heard so many jokes about it that I've been wanting to see this forever.  So, naturally I jumped on the chance to pre-order this and got my set from Amazon in yesterday's mail.

The prints are gorgeous, and the clothes, cars, and street scenes, take me right back to that wonderful world of 1965, like some sort of time capsule. Unfortunately, the show needs a lot of help.  I like Jerry Van Dyke and find him much more appealing than his famous brother.  So he isn't the problem.  I just can't grasp the idea of someone coming back as a car and communicating through the radio dial.

I never thought we would ever see this released on DVD, and so I intend to finish watching every episode.  I have several DVD releases from TGG Direct and I appreciate how they continue to bring us a lot of vintage television.",1384300800,34,1158,4.450236966824645
6061429,5,B00G5N6C8U,"Somehow Allan Burns (who later co-created immortal sitcoms like ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Taxi"") also managed to co-create ""My Mother the Car.""

In hindsight, it's difficult to understand why this show seemed so ludicrous sight-unseen in 1965. It is said that the reason ""My Mother the Car"" hit the Top Ten on its first night is that America simply couldn't believe that there could be a TV show with such an outrageous plot: a lawyer discovers his mother rein-CAR-nated on a used car lot.

Reviewers gleefully derided the show, generally for its premise: ""...The only thing that's funny is that somebody actually made it into a television show...""  and ""...It's an insult to cars and mothers everywhere..."" and ""...My wife said she may never drive another car as long as she lives after seeing this..""

But it's hard to understand why this particular show was considered so over-the-top back then.  I mean, I totally think it's a totally weird show.  But in the '60s?  Really?

Already the airwaves were populated by suburban monsters (""The Munsters,"" ""The Addams Family""), genies (""I Dream of Jeannie""), witches (""Bewitched""), Martians (""My Favorite Martian""), campy super-heroes fighting zany villains in color-coordinated costumes (""Batman""), and an incompetant secret agent who owned the world's first mobile phone, albeit in his shoe (""Get Smart""--he was later threatened in one episode with the ultimate torture: ""Ve vill force you to vatch reruns of 'My Muzzerr Za Car.'"")  If you caught afternoon reruns in 1965, you might also see a talking horse (""Mister Ed""), a talking mule (""Frances"") and a ghost who happened to be an alcoholic St. Bernard lapping up martinis from a gargantuan martini glass (""Topper"").  And the strange and bizarre would continue throughout the '60s and just into the '70s with pigeon-English-spouting cavemen (""It's About Time""), even more ghosts (""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"") and a psychic nanny (""Nanny and the Professor""), to name just a few.

I can't figure out why the reincarnated mother was considered THAT outrageous for a generation of television viewers so glutted with such bizarre gimmick-laiden sitcoms.  Reading all those bad reviews for this show's basic premise, I feel like I'm listening to connoisseurs of Cold Duck debating the competing virtues of varying vintages.

I guess you had to be there.  (I wasn't).

That said, this really is what star Jerry Van Dyke (who turned down the role of ""Gilligan"" on ""Gilligan's Island"" for ""My Mother..."") promoted it as in 1965: ""...Our answer to 'Mister Ed'..."" meaning a sitcom inspired by the talking-horse show.  It's about a man having a clandestine relationship with this supernatural being, leading to all sorts of shenanigans and cover-ups that complicate his marriage.  But in that sense, the supernatural secret also makes it next of kin to ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" ""Bewitched,"" and to a lesser degree ""My Favorite Martian"" (where the complications caused by the wife are replaced and intensified by a nosey landlady and a suspicious detective).

And so if you have a taste for ANY of the aforementioned '60s sitcoms, you'll probably enjoy this show.  It's all the same fun, same style of humor and same innocence for the whole family...without the shop-worn predictability of a show you've seen a million times.

Like ""Petticoat Junction,"" which had the recurring tension of nasty Homer Bedloe repeatedly showing up to shutdown the train that brought guests to the Shady Rest Hotel, this show has its own recurring villain: Captain Bernard Manzini, a zany antique car collector who owns every car ever made...except for the model and year of ""Mother.""  Played to hilarious perfection by Avery Schreiber (""Match Game"" and countless Doritos commercials), the show is worth buying just to watch the obsessive, frenetic car collector scheme to steal or buy ""Mother.""

Perhaps the passage of time and the changes in tastes will make ""My Mother the Car"" even more enjoyable to those who enjoy the old TV shows that seem to celebrate a simpler time...even if it is--maybe even because it is--a simpler time that never really existed.",1384214400,37,4132,5.099406528189911
6061430,4,B00G5N6C8U,"MY MOTHER, THE CAR has been unfairly tainted as one of the worst TV shows. It was even alluded to in an episode of GET SMART.

6061431,5,B00G5N6C8U,"Thank goodness for companies like TGG Direct and others that keep digging through the dusty vaults of pop culture and keep unearthing treasures like the notorious 1965 fantasy-based TV sitcom ""My Mother the Car.""

As TV historians Gary Gerani and Paul Schulman noted in their book Fantastic Television, ""My Mother the Car"" added a whole new meaning to the term ""reinCARnation.""

Even though the series has not been seen on American television in well over 40 years, it has incurred the scorn of some critics, often from those who have never seen it. ""My Mother the Car"" did receive some criticism during its initial broadcast, but the show had its share of fans, too.

Considering the wide array of fantasy-based sitcoms that were populating network television schedules in the 1960's, ""My Mother the Car"" fits easily along side such series as  ""Bewitched,"" ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" ""It's About Time"", ""My Favorite Martian,"" and even ""The Patty Duke Show"" with its premise of ""identical cousins"" who often created quirky situations bordering on the surreal.

For those who have heard that ""My Mother the Car"" is television's worst sitcom, I can only suggest watching some episodes and judging for yourself.

As a teenager in 1965, I was glued to the tube and watched everything, including ""My Mother the Car."" In fact, it was one of my favorite shows, and I sorely missed it when it was canceled after one season.

Through the years, I've often thought about ""My Mother the Car,"" but never got to see it on television in syndication due to the limited number of episodes that were filmed.  Thankfully, in this modern age of cable TV, the Hulu Network is showing ""My Mother the Car"" and is generating a whole new fan base for the show.

I've always been a Jerry Van Dyke fan and loved seeing him in guest appearances in various TV series and doing his stand-up comedy on variety shows. In ""My Mother the Car,"" Jerry plays L.A. attorney David Crabtree who lives in a sunny, well-manicured neighborhood with his beautiful wife Barbara, played by Maggie Pierce,  and their two small children.

Before being selected for the role of Barbara Crabtree, Maggie Pierce was a fashion model and character actor who appeared in many TV series. In the pilot episode, Barbara sends husband David on a mission to find an affordable station wagon that will accommodate their growing family.  Instead, David discovers an old, dilapidated 1928 Porter car on a used car lot, promptly forgets about the station wagon, and decides to bring the old Porter home with hopes of restoring it into a family ""fun car.""

But even while the antique car is still on the used car lot, David discovers that the voice coming out of its radio speaker is not that of a local DJ, but that of his dearly, departed mother (voiced by film legend Ann Sothern) who died 16 years earlier. She matter-of-factly informs him that she has returned to Earth reincarnated... as a car! She also tells him that ""we don't have any choice in how we come back.""

And it's this thread of fantasy that ties together the crazy patchwork quilt known as ""My Mother the Car."" In some ways, this series is similar to ""Mr. Ed."" Ed, the horse, talks to Wilbur when no one else is around, and the 1928 Porter talks to David when... well, you get the picture.

""My Mother the Car"" appeared on NBC during the 1965-66 television season. It was in color with a total of 30 episodes. The new DVD  box set will contain all 30 color episodes, but, according to the TGG Direct website, will contain no ""extras.""  That's okay, a TV series this rare is great to have, with or without extras.

Aside from the fully remastered, beautiful transfers (they must have been taken from the original camera negatives), bright colors, and crystal clear sound, the original laugh tracks have been removed. This greatly adds to the viewing enjoyment of the series.

By buying DVD sets of old TV series made available from companies such as TGG Direct, Shout! Factory, Timeless Media, TV Time Machine/Lightyear, and others, we provide the support needed to insure that more series will be released for our enjoyment and for the enjoyment of future generations of fans.",1383177600,71,4178,4.761772853185596
6061432,4,B00G5N6C8U,"LOOK FOR THE FINE PRINT!! Get this one! When looking at the very bottom of the item description, look for DVD-R! The cheaper set comes that way...burned by Amazon (in more ways than one!). This set (around $25 vs around $18 for burned) not only should last longer, but unbeknownst to the purchaser, has a nice factory OUTER BOX that houses the two regular DVD cases.

We'll take DVD-R if that's all we can get, but in this case it's well worth the few extra bucks to get it right!

Loved this series as a kid..still very enjoyable, but they really ran the car collector-trying-to-get-the-car-thing into the ground.

Now if Amazon wants to help us out, how about burning some series that otherwise probably won't otherwise see the light of day: The Second Hundred Years, Custer, Hondo, Mr. Terrific, & The Double Life Of Henry Phyffe.

6061437,4,B00G5N6C8U,"I was 4 years old when this show was originally broadcast.  Watching it now I see how script writing has changed over the years.  In 1965 it was simple plots, jokes and sight gags.  Something simple and silly just for entertainment and a few laughs at the end of the day.

Current sit coms try to deal with social matters and act as a commentary in a comedic setting.  All things considered, sometimes I'd rather just let my mind rest.  My Mother The Car is the type of comedy where the viewer can just watch and not have to think about anything.

The show has been derided as the worst series ever broadcast, or the worst concept ever for a TV show.  Titles the show never deserved.  It was a product of 1960's era comedy thinking.  It's contemporaries were the shows ""I Dream Of Jeannie"", ""F Troop"", ""The Addams Family"", ""The Munsters"" and ""Mr. Ed"".  All simple plotted comedies with their share of slapstick sight gags.  They were only there for light entertainment value, same with My Mother The Car.

Nothing wrong with just getting a giggle from a show.

My vote for the worst thing ever broadcast, A show called ""You're In The Picture"". Contestants would put their faces through a hole in a painting and Jackie Gleason would feed them clues.  The contestant would have to guess what painting they were in.  The show lasted one broadcast.  Gleason gave a televised apology the next week.  If the star of the show has to apologize for a broadcast, it had to have been bad.",1434758400,,1477,4.509433962264151

It's certainly wierd in that the protagonist's mother is reincarnated as a car however the situation comedy is poorly developed and revolves around a common and repeated plot of someone trying to steal the car/mother.

6061445,4,B00G5N6C8U,"My parents had just bought an RCA ""New Vista"" color TV and the red '28 Porter which was the reincarnation of David Crabtree's late mother (Ann Sothern, speaking through the radio) got my father grumbling about ""back in those days just about every car was black"". Looking back, I'm surprised that my dad didn't make an issue of radios in cars--did they have them back then? It never occurred to me several years later in the days of ""Knight Rider"" and KITT that there had been a precedent to a talking car in a TV series--and I'd seen it myself. One feature of the show was this annoying antique car buff who constantly pestered Crabtree about selling ""Mother"". But he always got Crabtree's name wrong; ""Cranston""/ ""That's CRABTREE""/ ""Whatever"". I don't know who played that dude--I'd forgotten that Crabtree was played by Jerry Van Dyke and I had to do a search to find out Ann Sothern had voiced Mother. But I still remember the theme song--let me run a search on all the lyrics. Okay, here goes;

""Everybody knows in a second life, we all come back sooner or later.
As anything from a pussycat to a man eating alligator.
Well you all may think my story, is more fiction than it's fact.

Mancini frequently shows up in many episodes trying to buy or steal the Porter (the only antique missing from his private collection) from Crabtree.  He always gets Crabtree's name wrong, Crabtree corrects him, then Mancini dismisses it as ""whatever"".  It's not the most well-written show. The writers certainly did not utilize the talent they had in their hands with Jerry Van Dyke (Crabtree). It isn't knee-slapping, fall-off-the-couch comedy. (Jerry Van Dyke is a scream in ""Coach"" and his guest appearances on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".) But before you know it, you're drawn to this, shall I say, ""endearing"" relationship between Crabtree and his mother (her lovely voice played by Ann Sothern) the car.
Critics said this was the second worst show on television. Really? And Mister Ed was more entertaining? PLEASE.  If you don't care what the critics say and want a cute, clean classic tv show to watch, I think you will enjoy My Mother the Car. This series is packaged in two plastic cases of dvd's in a colorful box. The images are crystal clear, and the sound is good. The theme song is catchy and will be in your head all day long.  :) I can't say it's among my favorite classic tv shows, but I enjoyed watching it and don't regret my purchase at all. I would much rather watch this show than a lot of the junk that's on tv today. If I had kids, I would very much prefer that they watch this show than a lot of the junk they're programming for kids today.",1400025600,3,1983,4.469613259668508

6061475,4,B00G5N6C8U,"""My Mother The Car"" does NOT deserve its reputation among TV critics (and some viewers) as the worst sitcom of all time.  The premise of someone being reinCARnated as a car is fanciful and far-fetched, while the show itself is very silly and over-the top.  Those same descriptions could also apply to other TV series from the sixties, including ""Mister Ed,"" ""I Dream Of Jeannie,"" and ""Bewitched,"" to name a few.  While those shows lasted several seasons and are fondly remembered, ""My Mother The Car"" only lasted one season and, not having enough episodes to make it into syndication, is barely remembered.  After viewing all thirty episodes, I can honestly say that I found them to be amusing and enjoyable.  Jerry Van Dyke, who stars as attorney Dave Crabtree, proves that he can carry a TV series as the main character very well.  Avery Schreiber, who plays his nemesis Captain Manzini, is also a talented comedian, and makes for a comical villain. The video quality of the show is outstanding; the colors are pristine and vivid.  In addition, I was pleasantly surprised that most of the laugh tracks were removed.  Last but not least, the theme song by Paul Hampton is very catchy and memorable.  All in all, I can heartily recommend ""My Mother The Car"" as a family-friendly show that does NOT insult the viewer's intelligence.",1392940800,2,1331,4.828193832599119

I was pleasantly surprised and pleased when I saw the original episodes were now available on dvd. While the premise of the show is rather silly (weren't Bewitched and I Dream Of Jeannie equally as silly?) it is a fun show to watch. The quality of the transfers is excellent!

6061499,4,B00G5N6C8U,"This 1960s ""gimmick"" show has a reputation as being one of the worst shows ever made, mostly by those who never saw it.  The premise IS absurd:  The central character, David Crabtree, has a 1928 Porter who happens to be his mother (reinCARnated, as people repeatedly note).  The car, like Mr. Ed, and Francis the Talking Mule, will talk only to one person, leading to amusing situations.  The plots in MMTC revolve around the car, with many of the episodes centering on the unsuccessful attempts by a rich collector, played by Avery Schreiber, to own it.

The comedy is broad, the scripts are not that great while few are outright bad, and let's face it:  This show's target audience was children.  It was not meant to be sophisticated comedy, unlike star Jerry Van Dyke's brother's show.  I remember watching it on delayed broadcast when it first ran, and I enjoyed it.  Watching the episodes on DVD nearly fifty years later, I can say the show does not deserve the bum rap it has received by reviewers like TV Guide.  I would honestly rank it as a three-star program, better than some comedies of the era, and not as good as others.

The DVD package I rank higher than the series.  The prints are crisp and sharp; it has never looked better.  Some quibble with the packaging, but I don't find the box objectionable (by the way, that is actor Sonny Tufts pictured with Jerry Van Dyke on the box and DVDs and also appeared in an episode of the show).  Some reviewers note the lack of a laugh track on most of the episodes; that isn't a negative in my book.

8620940,3,B00G5N6C8U,"This show delighted me when I was six. My other faves were Mr Ed and Car 54...and oh yeah, My Favorite Martian. I've since found out My Mother The Car is supposed to be one of the worst shows of all time...and frankly, I take issue with that. I am no longer six, and yeah, I can see the flaws in the show. But with all the other dreadful fare around at that time, like Gilligan's Island, Hogan's Heroes, Green Acres, Petticoat Junction, Beverly Hillbillies, the Munsters, F-Troop...painful crud...oh, man, how I hated those shows as a little kid, and still can't deal with them...so how is THIS show the worst you can get? (Hogan's Heroes struck me as particularly distasteful---funny Nazis? even when I was a child. But my dad, a WWII veteran, really liked the show, so it was turned on every week.)

My Mother the Car is no stupider in conception than any of those, or the later Knight Rider, or Alf, or any other such whimsical fare. My biggest problem with this show, watching it as an adult, is that the quality of writing is pretty bad, the action unmotivated, and the characters are really tissue paper. Their personalities lack logical continuity from episode to episode. The directing is altogether odd (I don't think they knew what the point of the individual scenes might be when they directed them), and I do think the whole show was kinda phoned in. However...I truly find it no stupider than any of the other junk I listed above. And, in fact, I can see where this show would have been good...if people had tried to make it arch and funny, and not such a generic fun-family item. It needed a bit of thought and some comic inspiration, of which this show has none. But that still doesn't make it the worst.

What is good about it: it brings back mid-60s, pre-Beatles era nostalgia for me, and gives me a sense of sunny California at a time when we were still kinda innocent and thought we could watch something that wasn't a crime show. That told us what families might look like when all the members pretty much enjoyed being around each other. It's a slice of life in a way, even if not done very well. The women wear the stock hairstyles and clothes, and sport the attitudes of the time---including total disrespect for men's intelligence. And of course the leading man here, Jerry Van Dyke, although a lawyer, displays no intelligence at all. I mean zero.

Is it possible Jerry Van Dyke just didn't have enough native comedic charm to carry this? I don't know. Maybe when they tried to create this show, it was sold on how Jerry Van Dyke was the brother of a comic genius, and so he just had to be a comic genius too, so what a great opportunity this was to fill a time slot? Hmmm. Sadly, he wasn't a comic genius. Not then and not now. But he wasn't awful either, and the producers just didn't do a very good job with this...emotionally, I think no one really claimed this show or cared about it when it was being planned, written, shot, edited. Who knows why. But it deserved better, and could certainly have been, with the right show runner. Jerry Van Dyke would have been as good as anybody else in the hands of competent people. And Avery Schreiber, as Captain Manzini, was almost good...he just needed better handling too. The directing is so loose in his scenes, it's like The Monkees program without the Monkees; there's no heart. It's just an ""almost good"" at times. Needed some brains attached to it.

So not the worst. Kinda fun. Enjoy it if you think you want the nostalgia and the light heartedness. Just don't expect it to logically hang together in any way. It just can't...and that's not me talking about the idea of the car being a reincarnation of a man's mother. The plots of the individual shows seem like they were all Disney rejects. The car is not the problem. The production team is. Funny how those guys all got attached to much better projects later...and did quite well with them. Somehow I think there is a Hollywood story behind all this...the show that almost was...I'd love to hear it. (Maybe they wanted Jerry Van Dyke to bomb? Did he annoy the crap out of some key people?)",1498176000,,4123,4.500667556742323
8620941,2,B00G5N6C8U,"MY MOTHER, THE CAR: ls this, as it has often been labeled, truly ""The worst series of all time""? Hardly, given the competition then and now, but this tame Jerry Van Dyke vehicle can hardly compare to the glut of sixties super-unnatural sitcoms (Bewitched, The Munsters), especially Mr. Ed, its obvious inspiration. Dick's younger brother plays Dave Crabtree, whose dear departed Mom has been reincarnated as a nagging 1928 Porter (voice of Private Secretary star Ann Southern, speaking through the car radio). Van Dyke seriously underplays the stuttering, clumsy persona he perfected on The Dick Van Dyke Show and many years later as Luther Van Damme on Coach (his most memorable role). Shifty eyed, mustachioed comic actor Avery Schreiber...of Burns and Shreiber and Doritos commercials renown...is wasted as Captain Manzini, who can never seem to get Crabtree's name right (a tiresome running gag) and will stop at nothing to add Luther's auto to his vintage collection. Created by Allan Burns and Chris Hayward, who went on to much better things like Room 222 and Taxi, My Mother the Car may boast a perky earworm theme song, but after the credits roll, it's downhill all the way.

8620947,5,B00G5N6C8U,"Often called the worst sitcom of all time, these DVDs set the record straight once and for all. While certainly not the best TV of the 60's, viewed in the context of its peers it's perfectly good entertainment. Fantasy comedy was rampant in the mid 60's. While a couple shows survived the decade (Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie) most came and went quickly. Even ""classics"" like The Addams Family, The Munsters and Gilligan's Island only lasted 2 or 3 seasons. That this show lasted a full season and is still a topic of discussion 50 years later is a testament to it not being as bad as legend would have you believe. Anybody remember Mr. Terrific? How about Captain Nice? I didn't think so. Jerry Van Dyke alone is worth the price of admission....a talented, funny actor. Comparisons are often made to his brother Dick and I think Jerry is at least as good. Remember, his sitcom career (Coach) outlasted Dick's, depending on how amusing you found Diagnosis Murder. Anyway, on to the particulars. The 5 disc set comes in 2 standard DVD multi-cases, with both of those inside a sturdy cardboard box. The artwork is, well, odd. It depicts Dave Crabtree (Van Dyke) in a completely open car (no roof OR windshield) with Sonny Tufts riding shotgun. I only know this because Mr. Tufts appears in an episode as himself. This scene never appears in the show and I have no idea why it was chosen. Actually there is no decent picture of Mother anywhere on the box or cases. Strange. The shows themselves are gorgeous. I've never seen a vintage TV show reproduced as well as these. Sound quality is great as well. Kudos to MGM and TGG Direct for such wonderfully remastered and reproduced shows. Kudos as well for stripping out the laugh tracks. The 2 episodes that still have it (no idea why they were missed) only serve to prove how bad those thing were. If there's a negative here it's only that there's no special features. Understandably, little would have survived this long, but Jerry is still around and commentary or an interview would have been great. Still, for under $20 for 30 episodes on 5 discs, this piece of classic TV history should be in any '60s TV fans collection.",1461715200,3,2173,4.632124352331606
