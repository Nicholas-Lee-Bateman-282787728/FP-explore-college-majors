7990493,5,B00009ATK9,"CAMPFIRE TALES (1991) On DVD Starring Gunnar Hansen. DVD not to be confused with the 1998 Release (same title, differnt movie).

3 young boys are out on a camping trip within the woods and encounter the towns derelict (Gunnar Hansen). He begins telling them tales of terror that include,.. a Satanic Santa Clause, Zombie Pirates with a score to settle, Hook Handed Killer who loves severing heads, Pot Heads who literally have a melt down from some curious Marijuana and a surprise ending the 3 boys don't see coming.

This uncut & uncensored version has classic blood, guts and gore, NO CGI here, FX done properly (old school style). Worth the price of admission, so grab a slice of pumpkin pie, marshmallows & a joint (IF YOU DARE) and watch CAMPFIRE TALES starring Gunnar Hansen (Texas Chainsaw Massacre)

7990496,4,B00009ATK9,"When you're a fan from ""TALES FROM THE CRYPT"",that one is good enough for you!
This movie looks very cheap and got not the standart from the HBO-Series.
Gunnar Hanson play's only the host of this compilation,but the stories are very nice for a creepshow-fan like me!",1270080000,3,266,4.680851063829787
7990497,1,B00009ATK9,"This is a cheap grindhouse anthology of 4 stories involving a madman with a hook, some oozing weedfreaks, an evil Santa Claus and Zombie Pirates.

Although there is a lot of gore and the special effects aren't so bad, the stories are very stupid and badly executed.
It doesn't fit in the 'so bad it's good' category either, cause it has no entertainment-factor at all.

If you're just looking for Gore and don't care about bad quality, or if you're an Anthology-Completist this might be interesting for you, otherwise be warned of this [...].",1251072000,,542,4.75531914893617
7990498,5,B00009ATK9,i'm not trying to say this is the greatest movie of all time or anything close. but i have to be honest it is one of the better grindouse/horror films. it's broke up into four shorts that are definately worth your time for a midnight movie rendevous!,1234656000,3,250,4.340425531914893
7990499,1,B00009ATK9,"Actually this is not the movie ""Campfire Tales"". The plot of this one sounds to me like a horrible movie called ""Campfire Stories"". Stick with ""Tales"", it is a much better movie.",1147564800,3,178,4.59375
