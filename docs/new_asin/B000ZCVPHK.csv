8235261,5,B000ZCVPHK,"These are two of Cousteau's standout episodes. His photography, and especially the underwater work, is stunning. But be mindful also of the eloquent, almost poetic script by Theodore Strauss, who narrates as well. We all know of Easter Island, but it takes the Cousteau team to figure out the fog shrouded mystery of what happened there in the past two centuries. Is it an allegory for the worst of the human spirit? Perhaps, but ""fish do not build cathedrals."" Then there is Clipperton, as strange and enigmatic as any place on Earth. The story of what happened there to a marooned family will shock you and will haunt your memory for years. Absolutely riveting - these and the two-parter on Egypt are perhaps Cousteau's best work.",1354147200,3,732,4.817460317460317
