3822416,4,B001VG2MBC,"fascinating look into the lives of europeans living in india, mostly hippies but a few who i wouldn't consider as such. there's a couple incredibly scenic clips in this documentary - for example the french lady in the little boat, and the man driving his motorcycle down a dirt track into the jungle - that are stunningly magical and beautified - and show a glimpse of their magical quiet authentic lifestyle far from westernization and adverts and news and technology",1383523200,,468,4.8625
3822417,2,B001VG2MBC,"I was expecting a lot more than what I watched from this video. It was kind of a sad situation with most of the people in this video. In one situation I felt deeply that the lady that was married to the man in this story was very abused by her husband. She finally left him, but, it was not a great movie at all. I do not recommend it. Sad and disappointing movie.",1378944000,3,364,3.9324324324324325
3822418,2,B001VG2MBC,"This seemed promising, at first. What else can I say, I would feel closer to enlightenment too, if I could abuse substances daily. Between the weed and the wine in this film, I saw a handful of tragic people who were stuck rebelling against overbearing parents. Not every exotic location and eccentric personality does a documentary make.",1373241600,2,338,4.947368421052632
3822419,3,B001VG2MBC,"HIPPIE MASALA: Forever in India is a documentary film by Ulrich Grossenbacher and Damaris Lthi about six people who went on the overland trail to India in the late 1960s/early 1970s and decided to stay. Cesare from Italy became a sadhu (a religious beggar) and spends his days chanting in the company of his Indian peers. Meera from Belgium did the same, though as a woman her experience has been quite different. Hanspeter from Switzerland settled down the Himalayas, maintaining a dairy farm and going hunting and fishing. Robert from Holland got into trouble as a youth running away from home and selling drugs, but once he made it to India he established a career as a painter. Finally, Erica and Gillian are South African twins who now design clothes in Goa, though we mostly view these two lushes enjoying their drinks.

The film has a number of interesting moments. Hanspeter and Robert have Indian wives, and the documentary discusses in some detail the cultural clashes of marrying a local. Some of the subjects speak of conflicts with their family that led them to leave Europe.

However, what stops this from being a great documentary, at least in my opinion, is that it gives very little information on the years between the overland trail and wherever they are now, especially their changing attitudes to the counterculture of 40 years ago. Hanspeter, for example, complains about people seeking a good time in India and says ""Couldn't you have a techno party in Switzerland instead of coming here?"" but we don't get a deeper glimpse into how his feelings have changed. Furthermore, anyone looking for more trivia on the overland trail will be disappointed. The first couple of minutes of the film show some fascinating footage of e.g. the Pie Shop in Istanbul and roads in Afghanistan (I'd love to know where these came from), but none of the interview subjects go into detail on this great migration.

Ultimately this documentary will appeal mostly to those interested in how foreigners adapt to Indian society and how they are accepted by the local people around them. The fact that these are hippies who came on the great overland trail four decades ago is pretty irrelevant -- the same sort of documentary could be made about people who arrived on a jet plane in the 1980s or 1990s.",1341532800,13,2300,4.83248730964467
3822420,1,B001VG2MBC,It was so boring!  I definitely don't want to go to India or hang out with old European hippies now!!!!!! yuck and boring.,1314316800,3,122,4.304347826086956
3822421,5,B001VG2MBC,Very insightful and revealing portrait of the eccentricity of living a life of peaceful,1444176000,,87,5.285714285714286
3822422,3,B001VG2MBC,"The documentary wasn't bad but it didn't really delve very well into the so-called hippies who moved to India. It basically just followed them around their day to day lives in India and gave a little background. Once the documentary gets under way though the characters become highly unsympathetic, especially the Swiss man. The film shows him verbally abusing his wife and generally acting like a class A D-bag by barking orders at her to feed the cows and cook for him. They give an interview to his wife who is clearly unhappy in her marriage and seems to be looking forward to obtaining better opportunities through her husband either by his death or via obtaining Swiss citizenship. Cant blame her and during the interview you feel a lot of sympathy for her and her situation. These people seem less like hippies and more like drugged up lazy navel-gazers from affluent backgrounds who dumped themselves on a whole new continent and culture under the guide of ""spiritual enlightment."" They never really interviewed any of the natives to get their perspective. I have read the natives resent the hippies in Goa. These expats laze around all day and expect the women to do all the heavy lifting and chores while they pretend to be seeking ""enlightment"" while taking drugs. But I will not downgrade the documentary because the people featured in it were D-bags. I will not give it a four or five because the film wasn't very stimulating and seemed to merely film the subjects going about their day to day lives and chores and didn't offer anything else.",1442966400,,1555,4.784386617100372
3822423,2,B001VG2MBC,"Young people who think partying and smoking pot is a way to live your ""life"" should watch this to see where it leads to. These old hippies didn't grow up, still smoking tons of pot and not contributing much of anything to society, sorry to be judgemental but watching this just made me sad for them.",1441843200,2,299,4.357142857142857
3822424,5,B001VG2MBC,"This is a kind of slow but nonetheless fascinating look at the current state of hippies that move to India (probably back in the 60s) that never left. Wow, what an interesting idea for a documentary. My very first girlfriend (we were five, lol) is one of those hippies and she died in India at age 40. I was with her for a few days when she came back to the US to renew a visa, but I never got to see her again after that...and I miss your terribly Jill. But it was a great connection for me to see how some of these folks live and why they made the decision to move to India and never return. If you're sitting home now in torn jeans and a gray ponytail (me), you'll get a kick out of this film. And it made me feel closer to Jilly Jill, so it was time very well spent.",1439596800,2,770,3.910828025477707

3822437,5,B001VG2MBC,"Beautifully photographed, thoughtful and unobtrusive, this documentary film shows the possible lives that many of us were searching for when we rejected our own cultures and, wandering about, found India. ""Here I can do what I want,"" says hard-bodied and harsh-voiced Swiss Hanspeter, while Italian Cesare the yogi informs us that he has erased his personal identity. He is so thin that it appears he has almost erased his physical being as well. I am so grateful that the filmmakers interviewed the hard-working and docile-appearing Indian wives of two of these Europeans, because we learn that both have sacrificed ties to family and community by their marriages, but with contrasting results; one dreams of escape, while the other seems to have found a richly satisfying family of her own with the most realized being shown in the movie, not a yogi but Dutch artist Robert Geesink. The landscapes chosen by these foreigners - the south-central Deccan plateau, the foothills of the Himalayas, Goa - are so beautiful that one forgets the larger context of India's cities, economics, and politics. Dropped out, indeed. Exploitive? I don't think so, not really - what do you think? This lovely film offers food for thought and feeling.",1418860800,4,1234,5.083743842364532
3822438,4,B001VG2MBC,"I read all the reviews after the movie. I liked it it was interesting the scenery /landscape was awesome..I am not sure exactly where it was filmed  at...I have been to India New Delhi,Agra ,  Khajuraho,Pashupatinath, Kathmandu,Nepal..in the 1980's.  My impression. was it was extremely hot ,  a potentially dangerous place for a woman; real culture shock.  It is worth watching if your interested in Hinduism, and or Ganga as a way of life...I too would have enjoyed hearing one Americans experience..",1402185600,,502,5.073170731707317

8346299,4,B001VG2MBC,I found this documentary an interesting look at a group of individuals who moved to India during their adventurous youthful days and how they acclimated to the country and culture eventually staying.

8346304,3,B001VG2MBC,Most films about India are shot in huge cities. I liked seeing the mountains and clear water that this film showed. I think Hanspeter is a jerk. He shows the ultimate condition of a pot addict - nice house sitting unfinished while his family lives in a tiny room. He only has negative things to say about the people around him.
