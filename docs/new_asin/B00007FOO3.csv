7975750,5,B00007FOO3,"if this release is what i guess [not quite sure since there are pretty few details about it], it's probably one of the best music video compilations i've ever seen; can be compared to onedotzero experimental series or notv vj clips compilations.

very nice, very inventive, very impressive.

my all time favourites are Gonzales ""Take Me To Broadway"" [fantastic fun & drive] and The Avalances ""Frontier Psychiatrist"" [real psycho ::] but nearly every video here is a pearl",1109289600,,471,5.0256410256410255
