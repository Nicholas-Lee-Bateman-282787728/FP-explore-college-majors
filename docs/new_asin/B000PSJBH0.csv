8193166,5,B000PSJBH0,A great DVD with exercises to increase bone density without using any of those deadly biphosphonates!,1480118400,2,101,5.375
8193167,1,B000PSJBH0,"Product is not as described in advertising.

Advertises light weight training but is focused on severe body stretching using an exercise ball.  Inappropriate for osteoporosis sufferers.",1208649600,2,185,6.076923076923077
8193168,4,B000PSJBH0,"I first purchased this DVD in 2007, following a DXA scan that showed my bone density to be lower than what would normally be expected for someone of my age. My overall impression of this workout at that time wasn't very positive - I thought it was pretty boring compared to the more popular and ""exciting"" workout DVDs I was using at the time. Now it is 2016 - almost 10 years later - and I think I must eat a little crow. After falling off the exercise wagon a couple of years ago, I'm not as conditioned as I used to be. When his year's DXA scan showed that my bones have now slipped into osteoporosis levels, I knew it was important to start working out again, but I'm also aware that I need to be more careful with the types of exercise that I engage in. I need workouts that target specific areas and that modify or avoid certain moves (especially forward flexion, which can cause spinal compression fractures in an osteoporotic spine). When I searched Amazon for osteoporosis exercise DVDs, Bonejuvenate came up and I decided to try it again. These are my current thoughts:

Positives: The instructor moves in a well-paced and controlled manner and gives a lot of form pointers, which is helpful. She demonstrates the moves solo, so there is no distraction of the camera panning out to others in the background - it stays solely focused on what she is doing. The background music is unobtrusive. I really like using the stability ball.

Points deducted: The instructor uses the same set of weights throughout the entire workout. I think it would make more sense if she chose different weights depending on the move she is doing and the muscles being engaged. She is in a large empty room and the sound echoes a little bit.

Overall: This is a nice addition to my small collection of workout DVDs specifically designed with bone density concerns in mind.",1196553600,,1859,4.576576576576577
8193169,5,B000PSJBH0,"Very nice program.  Chaptered and easy to use.  Pleasant instructor who gives excellent instructions.  You need to have a stability ball to use this DVD (but if you don't have one, get one--they're great!)  This DVD makes doing your resistance training for osteoporosis prevention very easy to work into you exercise plan.  My only slight complaint is that the music is a little odd, but it's very soft and easy to tune out.  Good information on osteoporosis.  Overall, a really good DVD.",1189641600,6,488,4.878048780487805
