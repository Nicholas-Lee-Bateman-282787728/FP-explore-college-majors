8031635,5,B0002SZ7O4,"Just look at the cover photo and you'll see John Schneider and Tom Wopat again wearing the clothes for the first time since 1985 when CBS's comedy-adventure Dukes Of Hazzard was cancelled after a six-and-a-half year run. Twelve years later,they delight their fans with this reunion movie. Daisy(Catherine Bach) is now Mrs. Enos Strate. In one of the last DOH episodes,Daisy was preparing to marry Enos(Sonny Shroyer),the Hazzard County deputy. Enos had loved Daisy throughout the series and his brief departure from Hazzard(Shroyer starred on the spinoff ENOS in 1980-81 and retuned to DOH in 1982). Since,DOH got the Nielsen axe,Sorrell Booke as Hazzard County Commissioner Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg passed away(in 1994). The new ""Boss"" is Roscoe P. Coltrane(James Best),who was Hazzard's sheriff on the series. I bet it felt great for Roscoe to be dressed in a white suit instead of the pastel blue shirt and black tie he wore when he was sheriff. It was written that Boss Hogg passed away as well as his portrayer. Filling Roscoe's sheriff shoes now is Enos and Hazzard's deputy is Boss Hogg's cousin Cletus(Rick Hurst),who returned for the reunion in desperation to fill Enos's shoes. Cletus first became Hazzard deputy in the 1980-81 season and was written out after 1982-83(the latter season was the only to have two deputies). Unlike Roscoe,Cletus and Enos liked and got along well with Luke(Wopat) and Bo(Schneider). Roscoe is still somewhat mean-spirited just like during his tenure as sheriff. Cletus and Enos only arrested the Dukes when ordered to by Roscoe and Boss Hogg when he was alive. Ben Jones as service station attendant Cooter Davenport,also returned for the reunion. Jones went into politics since the DOH demise. He also opened a nightclub/retail store called Cooter's in Virginia,where he now lives. By the way,Roscoe probably felt like he was his brother-in-law Boss Hogg(Boss Hogg's wife is Roscoe's sister Lulu). Also there's Uncle Jesse Duke,the patriarch of the Dukes household. Denver Pyle reprised the role of Jesse,several months before his Chsristmas Day 1997 death. Now for the plot:it's another crime of some sort,Luke and Bo driving around in their General Lee(a 1969 Dodge Charger) and Roscoe,Cletus and Enos driving squad cars. It's really no different from any episode of the series which premiered in January 1979. Daisy is still the same sexy beauty that she was throughout the series. Today,at age 51,Bach is still the same sexy beauty. The clothes that Wopat and Schneider wore in the front cover photo still fit like a glove. On the other hand,they could be duplicates of the originals. Anyway,this is what Dukes fans have been waiting for. You can see DOH reruns on CMT(Country Music Television) and collect DVD sets from the first four seasons. Season five will be released on December 13. Also scheduled for release the same day is the movie which got mixed reviews. I dedicate this item to the memories of Booke and Pyle.",1133395200,10,2972,5.079754601226994
