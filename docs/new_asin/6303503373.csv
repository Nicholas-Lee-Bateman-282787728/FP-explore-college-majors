7848898,5,6303503373,"I've just recently purchased 'Tyson' DVD (the James toback movie)

but of all the Tyson videos/Bio's out there, I must say this is probably the best pure boxing one. The fights/training footage from the catskill years on this video is something you won't find as much anywhere else. Although it is now dated but for any Tyson/boxing fan it doesn't really matter as the post late 80's/pre 90's Tyson became just a shell of his former glory self.",1239667200,,444,4.6923076923076925
7848899,5,6303503373,"I am a huge Tyson fan. I love watching his fights anytime, anywhere. I do agree entirely with what Blurb has said regarding the Lennox fight. Tyson was not only heavier and slower, but, since Tyson had fired Rooney a long time before, he had lost all he was taught from Cus. Also due to the fact he kept changing trainers which, in return, changed his fighting style. Slower, inable, loss of structure -- all of this was the build-up to the Buster fight and to the Lewis fight. If I were Mike, I'd be calling Rooney. But, I guess he doesn't want to be champ again.",1166572800,,564,4.280373831775701
7848900,5,6303503373,"PBS' Frontline program Waco: The Inside Story is a really impressive, well-made documentary that follows the course and fiery end of the standoff between the FBI and the Branch Davidians, from the original botched raid by the ATF on February 28, 1993, to the unsettling end on April 19.  This is primarily a look at the planning and evolving tactics of the FBI rather than an examination of the cult held in sway by the self-professed Messiah David Koresh.  It does, however, provide fascinating access into what was taking place inside the compound in the form of a number of tapes of FBI negotiators speaking to Koresh and his representatives, clips of a video Koresh made for the FBI in the midst of the siege, and surveillance audio tapes of Koresh and those around him obtained via bug.
I personally have never been overly critical of the FBI's performance in Waco.  David Koresh was clearly a madman, it was clear long before the assault that no one else was coming out, and decisive action should have been taken long before the seventh week of the drama, in my opinion.  As far as I was concerned, all the blood was on Koresh's hands and not the FBI's.  Clearly, the end result was not the type of resolution anyone (other than Koresh) wanted, but it was past time for the siege to end one way or the other.
This documentary has really enlightened me as to the FBI's work on the case, though.  I still support the FBI in what they eventually did, but clearly this was not a well-run or well-thought-out operation.  While the senior FBI agent in the area was nominally in charge, no one seemed to be running the show.  The negotiators and the action-oriented Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) constantly worked at cross-purposes, with little knowledge let alone coordination with one another.  The intensity of feelings between both groups is vividly evident still in the interviews with important players in the events.  The HRT were incredibly frustrated as negotiations wore on week after week, and small breakthroughs by the negotiators were oftentimes almost immediately squandered by visible actions of the HRT.  Basically, the men on each side of the issue are convinced they were right and the other guys were wrong and that, if it had been done ""our"" way, all those people would not have died.  Some of these men are very emotional, and it is hard to fault either group.  Clearly, it seems to me, the problem was a total lack of leadership.  This problem went all the way to Washington, where FBI Director William Sessions was already coming under harsh criticism before Waco became an issue and newly appointed Attorney General Janet Reno vacillated for six days before okaying a decision to use tear gas, a decision she reportedly made when someone in the FBI (no one knows who it was) falsely told her that children were being abused inside the compound.  There is no interview with Reno on this documentary, and I believe Frontline really let her off the hook in regarding her role in the drama.
The final assault on the compound really was a disaster exacerbated by some unsound early-morning decisions (strong winds helped blow the tear gas outside requiring deeper penetration by FBI forces, there was no plan in place to deal with a fire in the tinderbox of a compound, the likelihood of a mass suicide of the cultists was not given enough thought despite indications of such a possibility, no one really believed the cultists would remain inside once everything went down, etc.).  The FBI agents interviewed for the program are earnest and sincere men who were changed by the Waco debacle, but it is clear that they were all doing all they could to save the innocent children inside the compound.  Some are moved to tears as they recount the events of the final day.  These men on the ground in Waco do not deserve blame, for this was clearly a crisis in leadership that doomed the entire operation.  David Koresh basically held the FBI hostage all those weeks, embarrassing the organization time and time again.  The main problem is reflected in this documentary: no one, even today, is willing to step up and take responsibility for what happened.  Everyone in a position of leadership either passes the buck or remains silent.
Waco: The Inside Story is really as impressive a documentary as you will ever hope to find.  Probing interviews and the introduction of a wealth of documentary evidence really take you into the heart of the drama in a respectful and nonjudgmental way.  There are hard truths and tough lessons to be learned from the events in question, and this documentary does much to further these ends.",1074211200,2,4636,4.7675
7848901,5,6303503373,"I realize that this is Mike Tyson's life story and it wasn't intended to have all of his fights on this short documentary, but damn it, it just was not enough.  I actually analyze Tyson's fights and watch them over and over to see for weaknesses and strengths of his style.  I just shake my head when I compare him to what he is now and his skills are totally eroded esp. after watching the Lewis fight.  Tyson now couldn't hold a candle to the Tyson of the 80's.  Overall, I learned alot about Tyson's life and theres a lot of things he did do wrong to make it where he's just not respected anymore (I'm not talking about his mischief with the fighters in the ring, like Hollyfield or biting Lewis's ankle).  I'm talking about his personal life and the troubles hes been through.  I also think that even if Mike did beat his wife I did not think she was a good person either (Neither one were).  I think Mike tries to be a good person but he always finds himself back in trouble.
Side note on the Lewis fight:  First, I feel that Mike was not in good shape and he weighed 20 lbs. heavier than usual.  What is with overweight fighters fighting Lewis?  David Tua weighed in 20 lbs heavier than Lewis too.  Fat and slow is not going to beat a Lewis (even though I hate Lewis with a passion). In addition to being extremely slow against Lewis, Tyson did not have his usual dash speed against Lewis to get to the inside.  Also, Mike did not move his head that much against a top fighter like Lewis (because he was so tired by round 3).  Lewis moved into Mikes punches and jammed them effectively and reduced the power to 1/4.  Mike could not find his range and was either lunging in too far away and missing wildy or he was jammed up and tied up by Lewis in close range.  Mike did not practice at all against slipping a longe range jab.  He did not seem focused at all during the fight and seemed like money was the only motivating factor in this fight and that is the biggest destroyer of all fighters- when a fighter's fighting spirit is gone he will definately lose.  Last he let his life's problems get in his way (Law suits, and money problems and so forth).  I'm not critisizing Tyson by any means but I'm a fan of his and wish him the best.
The only thing I saw Lewis do wrong was he had his hands down alot.  But hey what do you got to worry about when your opponent only throws 149 punches in the whole fight.",1029196800,4,2414,4.197396963123644
7848902,4,6303503373,"If you are looking for a video with alot of action and fight footage, then this is the video for you.  This video goes step by step from day one through Tyson's career, even when he was a child.  It consists of interviews with anyone who knew Tyson; friends, promoters, and trainers.  This is the best hour to spend learning and answering all your questions about Mike Tyson.  And the video hits the hi-lights of his fighting career along with some great power-punching and shows why Tyson was to be feared in his prime.  An all around great video, worth every penny.  This is the video any boxing fan will watch over and over again.",974937600,22,633,4.460869565217391
