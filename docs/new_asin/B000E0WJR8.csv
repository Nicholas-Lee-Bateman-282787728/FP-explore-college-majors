2477843,4,B000E0WJR8,How can you have a DVD of ECW's most violent matches without New Jack?,1138924800,3,70,4.071428571428571
2477844,1,B000E0WJR8,"Where is the WCW Greatest Matches or any other WCW DVD?

For that matter where are any classic WCW event DVDs such as:

""WCW Starrcade'89 Future Shock"" - where singles and tag teams wrestle in the iron man tournament.

we saw dream matches like The The Road Warriors vs. The Steiner Bros. & Sting vs. Lex Luger (their 1st meeting in the ring.)

""War Games"" -(WCW Great American Bash'87 & WCW Wrestle War'91) the brutal and bloody double ring totally enclosed steel cage match.

-WCW Japan Supershow I,II & III

-WCW BattleBowl (Double ring battle royal)(WCW Starrcade'91,92,&'93)

-Skywalkers scaffle match (WCW Starrcade'86)

The WCW/old NWA has had many many legendary and classic matches:

*Ric Flair vs. Steamboat (WCW Wrestlewar'89 & WCW Clash of Champions VI etc...)

*Ric Flair vs. Sting (WCW Great American Bash 1990, WCW Clash of The Champions I, etc...)

*Sting & Lex Luger vs. The Steiner Brothers (WCW Superbrawl I)

*Sting vs. Lex Luger (WCW Superbrawl II)

*Ric Flair vs. Ronnie Garvin (WCW Starrcade'87)

*Big Van Vader vs. Ron Simmons (WCW Main Event)*Simmons becomes (The first black world heavyweight champion!!!)(1992)

*Sting vs. Bill Goldberg (WCW Monday Nitro)

*Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger (WCW Starrcade'88)

*Sting & Dusty Rhodes vs. The Road Warriors (WCW Starrcade'88)

*Sting vs. Big Van Vader (WCW Great American Bash'92 & WCW Starrcade'92)

*Dusty Rhodes vs. Lex Luger (WCW Starrcade'87)

*Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes (WCW Starrcade'84 &'85)

*Lex Luger vs. Hulk Hogan (WCW Monday Nitro) *Luger beats hogan for the title

*Macho Man vs. Diamond Dallas Page (WCW Great American Bash'97)

*Bill Goldberg vs. ""Big Pappa Pump"" Scott Steiner (WCW Mayhem 2000)

WCW had many big big superstars, so why doesn't WWE release DVD's about those stars such as :

*Sting

*Lex Luger

*Ric Flair (another ""Ultimate Collection"" would be great!)

*The Steiner Brothers

*Big Van Vader

*Sid Vicious

*Bill Goldberg

*Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat

*Booker T

*""Stunning"" Steve Austin (his career started in USWA and then WCW)

*Kevin Nash (Vinnie Vegas) (his career started in WCW)

*Scott Hall (Diamond Studd)(his career started in WCW)

*""Flyin'"" Brian Pillman (his career started in WCW)

*The Big Show (The Giant) (his career started in WCW)

*Dusty Rhodes

*Arn Anderson (Four Horsemen)

*Doom/Ron Simmons

*The Great Muta

*Midnight Express

*Rock-n-Roll Express

*Dean Malenko

The DVD sets should be complete with documentaries and at least 20 of their greatest matches on each DVD set.

The WCW many not be a company any more but the rich history of the superstars, events and matches still live on.

ECW and WWE maybe okay but WCW and the old NWA were around since 1905 and such a history and video library should not be buried, ignored or sit on WWE shelves.

The WWE has used the WCW video library only to help show other parts or pieces of WWE stars in WCW.

WWE has not really released official WCW focused events or superstar profiles DVD's (Such as Sting, who has only wrestled in WCW most of his career and never for WWF/WWE.)

WWE need to release what the fans want to see and leave their ego out of the business.

Any true fan of the sport of wrestling would want to see as many historic matches and events from WCW or any other league as they can no matter if they were a fan of the organization or not.

Stop trying to erase WCW history and events.

The ECW has a number of DVD releases under WWE but the WCW really has nothing to show for.

Start releasing WCW related events (pay-per-views) and superstar profiles just like the WWE does for the ECW.

2477847,4,B000E0WJR8,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

Tag Team Champions Public Enemy vs. Cactus Jack & Mikey Whipwreck - Mikey kept trying to avoid the fight & even begged Cactus to tag him out which he did only for P.E. to jump Cactus when he went after Mikey who ran away only for Mikey to come back using a board as a weapon while Cactus used Mikey himself like a battery ram to get offense in but P.E. got the advantage back by singling out Mikey & punishing him with double teaming & moves like the tombstone piledriver before the match got taken in the crowd with Cactus brawling with both men using everything from chairs to a table & even a fan's crutch however it was a miscue by Rocco Rock that resulted in something that nobody ever expected & Joey Styles stating the classic line ""Do you believe in miracles?""
""Hardcore TV"" Aug. '94

Shane Douglas & Cactus Jack vs. Sandman & Terry Funk - Both men started brawling right away both in & outside of the ring with Douglas using Sandman's cane on everyone including hitting his own partner while Cactus was using chairshots & his trademark over the top rope clotheslines on Sandman & Funk before continuing to brawl on the floor with Funk throwing whatever he could get his hands on along with being on the receiving end of some double teaming by Cactus & Douglas like an atomic legdrop.  Sandman & Funk used a guardrail as a weapon slamming it onto Douglas before crotching him & clotheslining him off of it before both teams brawled towards the entrance way with Cactus delivering a DDT on the floor & Terry Funk attempting to use a tool box followed by bringing out the flaming branding iron.  This was the wild & out of control brawl expected with all of the name involved.
""Hardcore TV"" Mar. '95
[ECW: Deep Impact]

Taipei Death Match: Axl Rotten vs. Ian Rotten - This was the first & only match of it's kind in ECW history taken from the movie ""Bloodsport"" as both men taped their fist & dipped them in glue followed by dipping then into broken glass to the point where Axl went around ringside to let the fans feel to see that it's real sharp glass as we also had a special twist at first in Bill Alfonzo as the referee.  Axl cut Ian after the first punch before they just went at it throwing punches with Ian grinding & rubbing his into Axl's face while also chopping & ripping away at his arm along with taking pieces of the glass off to cut Axl before Axl targeted Ian's forehead & sliced up Ian's arm.  Both men took it to more extremes with Ian delivering low blow punches & Axl backdropping him onto thumbtacks in a match that could only be described as ""gruesome"" as both men's faces where completely covered in their own blood.
Hardcore Heaven '95
[ECW: Path Of Destruction]

Mexican Death Match: Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Psicosis - Psicosis kept missing his offensive moves allowing Rey to keep capitalizing with moves like the head scissors takedown & frankensteiner including one that took both men over the top rope before Psicosis resorted to extreme measures such as launching a chair into Rey's face giving him the advantage with various high flying offense like a missile dropkick & moonsault & a senton with his butt landing on Rey's face along with power moves like a powerbomb & DDT on a chair but Rey fought back using the chair himself launching it at Psicosis along with a crossbody off the apron that took both men over the guardrail before executing a slingshot moonsault into the front row taking the match all the way through the crowd to the ""Eagle's Nest"" area where a frankensteiner was delivered on a chair that you had to see to believe.
November 2 Remember '95

Television Champion Chris Jericho vs. Pitbull #2 vs. Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio - This was the first ever four corner elimination match in ECW history that had a bunch of stories & highlights told throughout the encounter such as Shane Douglas starting it off with a ""BANG"" literally delivering a chairshot to Pitbull #2 during his entrance that busted him open & took him out of the match for the opening minutes, Jericho being very innovative with his offense including a submission that Joey Styles called ""Mr. Salty"" which would become an inside joke between the two men for the rest of their lives, Douglas continuing to avoid Pitbull #2 throughout the match except for when he was weakened by the other competitors, Pitbull #2 continuing to plant Jericho whenever he left his feet,
a chair being used for more impactful offense like a faceplant & bulldog & powerbomb, the strength of Pitbull #2 such as doing a soman drop off the top rope on one guy & later hip tossing another one over the top rope, Jericho & Scorpio fighting in the crowd, Douglas being the odd man out to the point where they were fighting over who gets to take him out, and unlikely alliances being made to eliminate other wrestlers.  This was a quality wrestling match between all four men to the point that it went long enough to fill an entire episode of ECW TV alone with the first elimination not happening until over half way through the match but is more remembered for the beginning of a long alliance that would dominate ECW for years afterwords & the infamous incident that resulted in the broken neck of Pitbull #1.
Heatwave '96
[ECW: Path Of Destruction]

Weapons Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee - Weapons are used on a regular basis in ECW but for this match, the ring was filled with various ones for each man to use with Beulah & Kimona pushing a shopping cart full of them to the ring allowing Dreamer to attack from behind starting to brawl in the ring making their way to the outside of the building with both men being thrown into whatever was around them from the metal warehouse garage doors to truck & U-Haul trailers while also being suplexed into the street into the surrounding fans causing Dreamer to bleed from both sides of his head as they continued to fight back into the ring with both girls also getting involved.  This was a crazy brawl from start to finish that saw so many weapons used that I couldn't keep track of them all but they all ranged from the usual ones you would expect such a trash cans & lids & chairs & road signs to some that you couldn't help but laugh at like hubcaps & a violin & steel mailbox but what this match was most memorable for was the aftermath where Tommy Dreamer took one of the most hellacious chokeslams you've ever seen.
Hardcore Heaven '96

Stretcher Match: Sabu vs. Rob Van Dam - These men have been feuding over respect throughout the summer with their previous match resulting in both men being taken out on a stretcher resulting in this match where the only way to win is for one man to be taken to the back on a stretcher.  Both men started out targeting each other's knee missing leg sweeps & connecting with dropkicks to the knee before Sabu was able to get the advantage with a brief leg drop & his daredevil offense of the slingshot leg lariat & headbutt along with RVD attempting a slingshot splash only for Sabu to counter with a dropkick & slingshot senton to the outside but RVD was able to regain the advantage with his educated feet such as a guillotine legdrop across the guardrail, spinkicking a crotched Sabu off the ropes to the floor, and top rope legdrop onto Sabu's face covered by a chair.  Both men continued to trade momentum with Sabu delivering punishment like a top rope legdrop that sandwiched RVD's between his leg & an open chair, two versions of the facebuster, and offensive moves onto the stretcher while RVD dished out as much as he took with the Van Daminator, moonsault off the guardrail, and a fisherman's buster off the apron through a table.  The entire RVD vs. Sabu series was extremely physical from start to finish & this match was no exception with the stretcher coming into play as a weapon of it's own.
The Doctor Is In '96
[ECW: Hardcore History]

Terry Funk vs. Sandman vs. Stevie Richards - Tommy Dreamer & Beulah joined Joey Styles on commentary for this match with the winner getting a shot against ECW Champion Raven afterwords.  Sandman was in control in the early part of the match by making teams with both men at one point only to betray his partner right away before going to the back & tossing a ladder tossed into the ring nailing Funk in the head & it continuing to be used as a weapon such as suplexing it onto Stevie, Funk attempting a moonsault off the top of it, Sandman coming off the top rope with it onto Stevie & later tossing it onto Stevie on the floor, the classic Funk airplane spin, and Stevie using it as a see-saw on Funk & Sandman.  More weapons came into a play such a trash can wrapped in sheet metal that nailed Funk in the head when tossed in the ring & Stevie suplexed on top of it along with barbed wire that Funk used to whip & Sandman later wrapped himself in it as a human battery ram while all three men continued to beat the hell out of each other in what was definitely an ""extreme"" triple threat match between all three leading to....
Barely Legal '97

ECW Champion Raven vs. Terry Funk - ...this match with Raven attacking right away with the championship & eventually busting Funk open with Raven continuing to attack that cut while also driving Funk through a table on the outside as Raven's nest came out to inflict more damage while also taunting Dreamer at the announce table causing Dreamer to take matters into his own hand.  The match wasn't much due to time restraints limiting what they could do but it was all about the emotional moment of if Terry Funk's could complete his comeback & become champion.
Barely Legal '97

Barbed Wire Match: ECW Champion Terry Funk vs. Sabu - Both men started out avoiding the wire early while trying to execute some offense with Sabu's Camel Clutch & Funk working over the neck with a hangmans neckbreaker & piledriver while being able to sent Sabu into the wire first raking it across the face & then crotched Sabu on it that just shredded his tights but Sabu was able to send Funk into the wire multiple times including having him tied up in the wire & ripping his face against it while also stabbing him with a peace of the wire.  There was a moment where Sabu's bicep was ripped open in the wire & had to tape it shut which allowed an opening for Funk who just took advantage continuing to work over his neck with a hangmans neckbreaker across open chairs & even making Bill Alfonzo pay for trying to get involved resulting him being a victim of the wire itself before Sabu came back using the wire cutters & ringside table as a weapon along with turning his body into a human pin cushion with the wire.  This match can only be summed by the statement Paul Heyman made in regards to it, ""I never booked another barbed wire match after this because nobody could top that one...and in good conscience, I didn't want anyone to try.""
Born To Be Wired '97
[ECW: Deep Impact]

Beulah McGillicutty vs. Bill Alfonzo - This initially started out as a mixed tag match but with Dreamer & RVD out of action, these two continued with Beulah taking a page out of Dreamer's ""Innovator Of Violence"" playbook that resulted in Fonzie busted open after this first move as they took the fight to the front row & back into the ring with Fonzie going low & using his whistle to choke before Beulah fought back beating the hell out of Fonzie with moves like the DDT, frankensteiner, and Dreamer's tree of woe.  Paul Heyman described this as ""5 of the most intense minutes in ECW history"" but it was also the bloodiest match in the history of the company as Alfonzo had to be rused to the hospital right afterwords.
As Good As It Gets '97
[ECW: Deep Impact]

Falls Count Anywhere/Death Match: FTW Champion Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't know the story behind the FTW Championship, it was Taz's personal championship he created to spite the company due to not getting a title shot against ECW Champion Shane Douglas despite the fact that Douglas was out with an injury. This was the rematch from Living Dangerously as Douglas was on commentary for this match was Bigelow was a fellow member of the Triple Threat faction. You know the direction this was going when Bigelow powerbombed Taz in the first few seconds only for Taz to get right up & deliever two strong clotheslines before taking Bigelow down with a samoan drop. They fought onto the rampway & through the crowd where chairs & guardrails where used as Taz kept focusing on using submissions. They made their way back to the ring where both men were victims of a table including Taz being busted open before making their way to the ramp again where a strong impact was felt on both men. Both men put in a strong performance here with Douglas only adding to the feel of the match on commentary.
[Falls Count Anywhere]

ECW Champion Taz vs. Shane Douglas - Taz won the ECW Title from Douglas earlier in the week but the match itself was received poorly due to all the outside interference involved so Douglas didn't have Francine to ringside & proposed that this match would just be the one on one.  Both men started out with some grounded amateur wrestling with them having a series of reversals & counters before Taz was taken to the outside with Douglas going aerial coming off the top with an axe handle using the cast on his wrist only for Taz to come back reversing a suplex through the table as they fought through the crowd with Shane being tossed off the bleachers through a table before Douglas once again went aerial doing a crossbody off the stage onto Taz as they continued to fight to the outside of the building & back to the ring.  This match heavily made up for their disappointing PPV match earlier in the week & delivered on what they stated would be, ""A world championship match that they could be proud of.""
""Hardcore TV"" Jan. '99

Falls Count Anywhere/Street Fight Match: Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Balls Mahoney & Spike Dudley - The match started out with all four men brawling with Spike launching himself over the top onto both Dudleys while weapons like a cheese grader & fork used by everyone caused all of them to bleed at some point as the fight went throughout the arena in the crowd with Spike once again taking a high risk diving off the balcony before making it's way back to the ring with more weapons used from a chair to thumbtacks & a flaming table.  This was just an all out brawl from start to finish.
""Hardcore TV"" July '99

ECW Champion Mike Awesome vs. Spike Dudley - Spike Dudley had the reputation of being the ""Giant Killer"" by defeating every heavyweight that's passed through ECW at one point or another but this was personal as he was out for revenge for Awesome knocking his girlfriend's teeth out of her mouth to the point where set up multiple tables around ringside...only for Awesome to toss him over the top rope through table after table followed by one hell of a killer lariat clothesline but Spike fought back delivering an acid drop on the guardrail & chairshot to the back while hitting & running doing moves off the top rope & taking Awesome to the outside as both men continued to fight back & forth with Awesome giving a chairshot & his crusierweight ability to springboard into the front row while Spike was able to give receipts for the tables & chairshots only for Awesome to just continue coming & delivering the punishment to Spike including without a doubt one of the most devastating Awesome Bombs you've ever seen.  This was definitely a ""David vs. Goliath"" match with Spike giving it everything he had & took more punishment that would have put down most other men in his shoes.
Guilty As Charged '00

Sandman vs. Rhino - Steve Corino & Jack Victory got involved early taking away the singapore cane yet Sandman was still able to beat on Rhino throwing him off the stage & even delivering a top rope frankensteiner while also using a ladder & table before getting his cane back causing more allies of Rhino to appear only for someone else with a common enemy to come to the aid of Sandman.  This match wasn't much as it only went around 5 minutes & was more about pushing the storylines between everyone involved than anything else.
""ECW on TNN"" Feb. '00

Super Crazy vs. Little Guido vs. Yoshihiro Tajiri - If anyone has seen their previous 3 way dances then you know this match full of various highlights like Tajiri catching Guido in midair with kicks to the ribs & head, Crazy's moonsault on the outside, Tajiri applying a tarantula to Crazy while Guido delivered a face-first dropkick, Tajiri's knockout kick followed by a brainbuster, and Crazy doing one tilt-a-wirl move only for Tajiri to come right back & do another.  The match lasted less than 10 minutes but was fast paced non-stop action.
""ECW on TNN"" Mar. '00

""I Quit"" Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. C.W. Anderson - This was not only the rematch from their previous PPV encounter but also Dreamer still looking for revenge for being out for weeks due to an injury caused by Anderson and we saw where Dreamer's mind was when he prevented Anderson from doing his signature throat slice taunt during the introductions.  Both men started exchanging chops on the outside & back in the ring with both men exchanging submission moves such as the dragon sleep & armbar & boston crab before Dreamer heavily focused on Anderson's arm being the innovator of violence by using a chair & the ring post along with other weapons such as the ringbell & hammer busting Anderson open but Anderson was able to recover launching Dreamer off the apron into the guardrail & used a chair in various ways such a drop toe hold & atomic drop along with various chairshots. They continued to trade momentum with the towel boy getting involved handing Dreamer ""Christmas presents"" including razor wire with Anderson giving him a receipt as they continued to punish each other in different ways such a spinebuster on the razor wire, vertical suplex on open chairs, death valley driver off the second rope through a table, and a vicious version of the crossface that not only hurt the neck but the eyes as well to the point where both men gained a mutual respect for each other & showed it after the match.  This was the career match for C.W. Anderson as they had a very physical competitive match.
Alternative commentary with Tommy Dreamer & Johnathan Coachman included how he prepared himself for the match, how it was his job in elevating stars in ECW, and the Philly vs. New York rivalry.
Guilty As Charged '01

Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome - This match stated off with Awesome using his power & athleticism such as an over the top rope shoulder block into the ring & suicide dive to the outside while later executing a top rope splash & a stiff powerbomb but Tanaka retaliated with a a running chair into Awesome in the front row before Awesome came back with 3 chairshots.  Both men from here used whatever they could get their hands on to beat the living hell out of each other including a tornado DDT onto a chair & later through a table, chairshot coming off the top rope, powerbombs through tables coming off the top or over the top rope, and suicide dive onto the other on a broken table.  This match was what you called a ""show stealer"" because this was the match that had everyone talking when the show was over & for a long period of time afterwords...and as a side note, pay attention to Joey Styles at throughout the match as he made it clear it's still got some hard feelings in regards to Mike Awesome's exit from ECW.
One Night Stand '05

(Bonus) Public Enemy vs. Gangstas - This match started out real violent was Johnny Grunge was bleeding in the opening seconds thanks to New Jack before Rocco Rock responded hitting him with a pie of all things & making Mustafa bleed while Grunge got his receipt on New Jack as this brawl started implementing more weapons like a cheese grader & cookie sheet & chair along with a bodies going through a table with the fight going into the front row & through the crowd before coming back into the ring with them using whatever they could get their hands on such as a frying pan & loaf of bread.  This was the final match for the first major act from ECW in Public Enemy before they headed to WCW & was the type of brawl that put them on the map in ECW as it was an out of control brawl that had some comedic elements but still hardcore.
House Party '96
[ECW Unreleased Vol. 2]

DVD Extras include interview with various ECW stars on matches on this disc such as Axl Rotten on the Taipei Death Match; Dudleys & Balls on the flaming tables; C.W. Anderson on his ""I Quit"" Match, a video on the Cactus & Whipwreck vs. Public Enemy match, Joey Styles on what he considers ""hardcore"", Doring & Roadkill talk breaking into the business, Justin Credible on being ECW Champion, and a hidden extra from Balls Mahoney telling the story of being put through the flaming table.

They did a great job with this one & really expanded ECW's video library and didn't just pick matches with the same guys so the wrestling or spots become repetitive & lose it's shock value with the only criticism I have is that the TNN matches weren't the best quality & could have been replaced.  For those ECW fans who aren't able to get these matches elsewhere (like the Pioneer Home Video releases) then I recommend.",1136678400,,21334,4.50879917184265
2477920,4,B000E0WJR8,I will say that while there are some good matches on here the hype was beyond belief. They should have just shown terry funk vs Sabu in the barbed wire match and been done.,1450828800,,172,4.088235294117647

2477922,4,B000E0WJR8,"This is a great DVD which ECW fans will love with almost 6 hours worth of matches. The matches are introduced one at a time by the legend himself that is Paul Heyman. However, ECW won't be everyones cup of tea, especially if you don't like the hardcore violence, and some matches on here are really extreme - more than anything you will have seen in WWE. A lot of the arenas are also quite dark and dingy, again something the newer fans won't have seen in the entertainment world of WWE.

I certainly wouldn't want any of my kids watching this unless they were over 18.

2477927,3,B000E0WJR8,"This is a pretty sweet combination of some really good & brutal matches. Almost everyone else has put up the matches on the dvd,so i am gonna talk about the quality. The first few matches are okay but not much bloodshed,until the Taipei Deathmatch however the other Taipei match with the same 2 guys where Axl pulls a fork out & starts prodding Ian's forehead,that was vicious ! But then again this match was nice. The matches with Dreamer are always good but i wish the scaffold match was in it,Tommy never disappoints. The Dudley Boyz match was insane with the
amount of table action. The followup match with Spike Dudley
competeing for the Heavyweight title was intense,he fought like hell but didn't quit & i thought that was wicked. The Sabu barb wire match was insane with Sabu really getting a beating but he took the win,he did some really insane technical and high-flying stunts that just make him such a legend. A truly hardcore match. The Stretcher match was really technical with Sabu vs RVD i enjoyed that because the 2 rivals work so well together & eventually become a team.(RVD coming out to aid Sabu in the barbwire match) The Mexican Deathmatch had no bloodshed or nothing like that but lots of high risk stunts. The 3 Way Dance match for the title was brutal and i loved every minute of it. The 4 corners match was crazy,bodies & battery everywhere. Tazz vs Shane Douglace was kinda tame but it shows just how strong Tazz is & i personally thought he was a very good wrestler & way better than being a commentator. Rhino vs Sandman was shirt but Rhino gave 1 hell of an ass whipping to Sandman & i wish there was more Rhino matches here. 3 way dance with Tajiri,Lil' Guido & Supercrazy was really cool cuz i had no idea Tajiri was with ECW because i grew up in the 90s & prolly don't remember. That match was crazy,not too much blood here nor with the Tazz or Rhino matches but good nonetheless. The I Quit match was pretty brutal with some great spots & bloodshed. The Intergender match with Beulah vs Bill Alfonso was not much of a match,just Bill Alfonso getting busted open & bleeding like a tweeker on blood thinners(cuz he was) and getting beat by Beulah. Tazz vs Bam Bam was alright but nowhere near as wicked or intense as the match for the title against Douglace. There are some good bloody matches & the others not so bloody just memorable i guess,but they were selected by the WWE not Paul Heyman on his own. There are extras about ECW & blood,the talk of the flaming table tactics. The Pitbulls & Justin Credible interviews,the Gangstas vs Public Enemy(House party) Axl & Ian discussing the Deathmatch,C.W. Anderson & Dreamer talk about their I Quit match. All in all i would say it is a fair amount of blood & good matches,some in depth interviews and some memorable moments. If you are a fan of the ECW matches & historical stuff then look no further,also look for the Rise & Fall of ECW,that dvd i found to be better and more interesting. Simply because they covered alot of ground,history being explained after it unfolds kinda thing. There is also a 1 Night Stand ECW dvd that i have yet to check out but i am sure it's good. I could have picked better matches but we can all say which match we prefer over the other it is all a matter of preference.",1436572800,,3286,4.460132890365449

ECW Tag Team Champions Public Enemy Vs. Cactus Jack & Mikey Whipwreck - ECW has just started not even a year before but man, they were still violent even before they were under the name EXTREME CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING! The match started out in the ring but soon progressed into the rabid ECW crowd just before the team of Cactus Jack & Mikey pulled out the biggest upset of the year after capturing the ECW Tag Team Titles from the Public Enemy! 4/5

(Extreme Warfare Vol. 1 3/18/95)

Axl Rotten - If you do not know the rules of this Taipei Death Match, both opponents wrap their hands in tape, dip those taped hands in super glue, roll their taped and superglued hands in broken glass and just punch the holy heck out of each other! This isn't one of my favorite matches on the set but it is still one bloody contest among these 2 brothers! 3.75/5

Mexican Death Match: Rey Mysterio Jr. Vs. Psicosis - The cruiserweights shines in this match as the 2 just went head to head with each other from the start!

Four Corners Elimination Match: ECW TV Champion ""Lionheart"" Chris Jericho Vs. Pitbull #2 Vs.

Two surprises occured in this match, first was the reigning TV Champion, Chris Jericho, being the first to go!

BLOOD SPORT
THE MOST VIOLENT MATCHES

1.{TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP}-CACTUS JACK, MIKEY WHIPWRECK VS PUBLIC ENEMY-this match is not as violent as some other matches may be but it is very memorable because of the ending that every one wanted but did not expect. They go back and forth with Mikey actually getting in some moves. As they battle Mikey gets the pin and wins the titles with Jack, a surprise ending at the time that had the crowd going crazy. 3.5/5

2. SANDMAN, TERRY FUNK VS CACTUS JACK SHANE DOUGLAS-this one is a little more violent and a lot of fun as well. The action in this one is great as both teams try to destroy each other with two ECW legends and two hardcore legends all come together for this one. Terry and Sandman take this one after a hard fought contest, I really enjoy this one. 4.5/5

3. IAN ROTTEN VS AXL ROTTEN-now this one is very violent as these two brothers go at it in a death match with glass glued to their tapped up hands. There is plenty of gore and blood in this one so it is right up ECW's ally. There is some outside interference from other familiar faces; Axl takes the win after a very bloody affair. 5/5

4. REY MISTERIO JR. VS PSICOSIS-this one right here is a classic no doubt as these two legends battle it out all over the place. This Lucha Libre style match was a good change of pace to the crazy things going on in ECW. But they added in that hardcore element to an already exciting style. In this match you had to pin your opponent and then count them out to 10. The action in this one is none stop and all should enjoy it, Rey gets the win in this great contest. 5/5

5. SHANE DOUGLAS VS CHRIS JERICHO VS 2 COLD SCORPIO VS PITBULL #2-this was for the ECW TV Title as Y2J defended it against these three killers. This full of all kinds of action and it last a while before the first elimination occurs. Jericho who is the champ surprisingly is the first one out. It does not take longer after that elimination that the next occurs when 2 Cold Scorpio bites the dust so to speak. Then it comes down to the two rivals, Shane and Pitbull. After all of this one of the most memorable moments in ECW history happens in my opinion involving a female, some pitbulls and some tables. The Franchise ends up taking this one after a hard fought battle and is awarded the TV title, great match. 4.5/5

6. TOMMY DREAMER VS BRIAN LEE-this match was a weapons match meaning every weapon was legal and featured one of my favorite wrestlers of all time Tommy Dreamer taking on the Brain Lee. This is a very violent match with all kinds of weapons put to use on one another, and even though Dreamer takes this one it does not work out for him. In one of the best moments from the company Dreamer is choke slammed onto four tables. Great, exciting and fun match right here. 5/5

7. ROB VAN DAM VS SABU-this is another really fun match between two of the biggest legends from ECW. These two really go at it doing any and every thing to each other even though they miss a few spots. Still they go all out doing things I could never ever do putting on a great match. This was a stretcher match that Sabu would eventually end up winning. 4/5

8. TERRY FUNK VS SANDMAN VS STEVIE RICHARDS-this is a classic from the first ECW pay per view called ""Barley Legal"". These three went at it to decide who would get a title shot after this match that night. There is a lot of crazy things that happen in this match with a lot of action. But it is the old man named Terry Funk who gets the win after a hard fought battle. 5/5

9. RAVEN VS TERRY FUNK-this was the match right after that last one for the ECW title as one of the best takes on an old man. Raven was basically unstoppable and no one expected Terry Funk to win this match. But in true under dog fashion he upsets Raven and becomes the new ECW champion. Great match. 5/5

DISC 2

1. SABU VS TERRY FUNK-this was the only barbwire match in the history of the company, and for good reason. These two literally got ripped apart by the wire and at one point they were so tangled in it that they could not move. It was even wrapped around Funk's throat, this is a classic. 5/5

2. BEULAH MCGILLICUTTY VS BILL ALFONSO-we follow that last one with another classic but for a different reason. This was not a classic in the typical way but because it was so violent in the short amount of time it took place, and because it was between these two. This one is very entertaining and the lady takes it. 5/5

3. TAZZ VS BAM BAM BIGELOW-once again we are treated to another masterpiece or at least in my opinion because I really enjoy this one. These two battle it out in the rematch and much like the first go crashing threw something. This time instead of the ring it is the entrance ramp. Tazz takes this one but not before taking some damage himself. 5/5

4. TAZZ VS SHANE DOUGLAS-Tazz returns to defend the ECW title against the man he took it from and once again we are treated to a classic. Both guys are excellent in this match and even make their way out of the building and go every were. Both give a great performance and pull out every thing they have with Tazz coming out on top once more. 5/5

5. DUDLEY BOYS VS SPIKE DUDLEY, BALLS MAHONEY-this is another one that is completely wild as these four guys seem like they will battle to the death. There is a lot of action in this one with all kinds of weapons being used. It ends after a flaming thumbtack table, poor Mahoney has to get slammed threw that. This is another really entertaining match. 5/5

6. MIKE AWESOME VS SPIKE DUDLEY-this match was basically Mike beating on Spike for the entire match. Spike would get in some really good shots through out but it was not enough. Another really entertaining fight that shows what ECW was all about. Excellent finish in this one for sure. 5/5

7. RHINO VS SANDMAN-this is a pretty good match between these two ECW legends, Rhino in particular is a favorite of mine. The action in this one is good and well paced, another entertaining match put on by these two. The ending to this one is cool. 4/5

8. SUPER CRAZY VSYOSHIHIRO TAJIRI VS LITTLE GUIDO-this is absolutely one of the best matches on this set for sure. These three put on one great show putting on a wonderful display of skill. This was a three way elimination match that would see Super Crazy win, but trust me when I say he earned it. 5/5

9. TOMMY DREAMER VS C.W. ANDERSON-this was a phenomenal ""I Quit"" match at least in my opinion on ECW's last pay per view event. One of the greatest ever Tommy Dreamer would go all out against C.W. in this hardcore match. Dreamer would take the win but only after a hard fought battle, there is a great commentary track to this match with Tommy. 5/5

10. MIKE AWESOME VS MASATO TANAKA-this match is the classic that was put on when the WWE put on one last event for the company. At ""One Night Stand"" these two would do battle in one of the greatest matches in the history of the company. These two got a standing ovation and even had the haters from WWE cheering in this match. Awesome takes it in spectacular fashion. 5/5

BONUS

11. GANGSTAS VS PUBLIC ENEMY-this match pits two of the most popular tag teams in the history of the company against each other. This is another worthy addition to the set with action all over the place. Public Enemy gets the win in this bloody tag match. 5/5

This is an excellent DVD set full of non stop action and classic bouts from the legendary ECW. Luckily I was there on the East Coast when this was going down so it will always be a personal favorite of mine. I highly recommend this DVD to every body out there.",1253750400,,7633,4.274428274428274
2478034,5,B000E0WJR8,"I've been a wrestling fan for some 30 years now. I remember the great bloodbaths between Jerry Lawler and Austin Idol/Tommy Rich in mid-80's Memphis. The ""I Quit"" match between Magnum TA and Tully Blanchard that set a new standard for brutality in American pro wrestling. The Shiek. Abdullah the Butcher. Bruiser Brody. And of course the bosses of the blade, the giants of the gig, the two most prolific mainstream bleeders in history, Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes. In the past, there were 2 ways to know you were watching an important match: announcer Jim Ross/Gordon Solie/Lance Russell getting really excited/distraught, and seeing blood. If a guy was gigging on TV, it usually meant a beginning, an end, or an escalation of a big feud. I could never, ever have imagined a wrestling promotion like ECW.
Not coincidentally, the aforementioned Lawler/Idol/Rich bouts in 1985-87 Mid-Southern wrestling out of Memphis were nasty affairs; brilliant booking that led to brutal bladings. The manager of the despised Idol and Rich was a new kid on the block who first went by Paul E. Dangerously, then briefly Paul E Dangerly, back to Dangerously, and finally to the brash loudmouth's birth name-Paul Heyman. I love this guy.
I missed the original ECW explosion. I heard about it-but I new of no way to see it, and besides, it was just another pro wrestling group, how good could it be? Answer: For about 5 shining years, it was the greatest promotion in the history of the business.
ECW;BLOODSPORT was the first true, clear taste I had of Heyman's boys in action. I'd seen YouTube's videos, but most were grainy, and frankly I don't like watching things on my computer. I was blown away instantly. Heyman narrates wonderfully, using that natural carny shill and his earnest love of ECW to draw us in. Then it's up to Cactus Jack, Mikey Whipwreck, and Public Enemy to keep us. And do they, and everyone that follows, deliver.
Almost all of the Hardcore greats are here-Mick Foley, who became a legend when he fell from the 'Hell in a Cell' cage in 1998, is here a couple of times. His hero and mentor, former NWA champion turned 53 year old Hardcore newcomer, Terry Funk, shows why he's adored by fans and fellow workers the world over. You'll see The Sandman, pounding beers, smokin cigarettes and swingin kendo sticks. There's Tommy Dreamer, perhaps the heart and soul of ECW. Future hall of famer Chris Jericho bumps with ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas, 2 Cold Scorpio, and Pitbull #2. Every match is brutal, bloody, and decidedly NOT for the WWE's current target audience. If Dad pops into Best Buy to buy 8 year old Timmy that Jeff Hardy or John Cena DVD he's been begging for, and they're sold out, Dad might just bring little Timmy this instead, assuming all wrestling to be about the same. And he'll happily hand his sensitive boy 5 hours and fifteen minutes of nightmares.
Two matches deserve special mention. The outrageous ""Taipei Death Match"" featuring Ian vs Axl Rotten-a family feud Richard Dawson would have steered clear of. The rules are simple: Put on gloves, put superglue on gloves, dip gloves in broken glass. Saying this is not for the squeamish doesn't quite do it justice. Suffice to say, there's not much hidden blading going on-the bros. Rotten just slash each other up with the glass. This is not Lou Thesz vs Whipper Billy Watson...or Chavo Guerrero vs Hornswaggle, thank God.
Lastly, and my personal favorite, features the ""Hardcore Legend"" Funk against high-flying, insane-risk-taking Sabu. This little delight takes place in a ring surrounded by barbed wire, and not some phony, ""non-painful"" kind, either. Both men get their bodies completely immersed in the wire, the barbs piercing flesh without forgiveness. Halfway through Sabu rips his bicep open on one of the sharp barbs. The muscle literally exposed, screaming ""My Arm!!"" Sabu does what any sane man would do-pushes the muscle back in the arm, gets some tape, and wraps his mangled bicep back together. No time outs, no medical help. Just more agonizing bumps ahead.
It's simple: If you're a true fan of this business, this DVD should be the first one you buy. Period.",1250812800,3,4150,4.854724964739069

1. ECW Tag Team Titles Cactus Jack and Mikey Whipwreck vs Public Enemy
This match is from the night Shane threw down the NWA title but the match is still pretty extreme but not very good a few tables are used and other weapons but this is still pretty timid combared to later in these discs 5.25/10

2. Sandman and Terry Funk vs Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas

This match is good but not as good as there 2/3 falls on Rise and Fall of ECW and it's a bit longer and slower so I guess thats why I don't like it as much but still a really good match and the best so far the spots get better as Psicosis isn't just destroying Rey Rey 8/10

5. Four Corners Match for the ECW Television Championship Shane Douglas vs 2 Cold Scorpio vs Chris Jericho vs Pitbull 2
Holy Crap is all I can say after watching this match it is over 40 min and I never get bored during the match it's just really enjoyable the spots are great and so are the falls the match is given time to turn into a classic and it does with a turn at the end and then it gets violent 10/10

6. Weapons Match Tommy Dreamer vs Brian Lee
I like it when a Tommy match goes into the crowd but not outside it is kinda boring when they are out there and thats pretty much the whole match so i just really don't get too much enjoyment out of this one 5.75/10

7. Stretcher Match RVD vs Sabu
Not to many botched spots in this one unlike there ladder match in wwecw I don't know how people say that match rules it is horrible in my standpoint but I love this match at first they use chairs and just do some wrestling which is good then here comes a table and the stretchers and this one gets brutal in a good way unlike the ladder match great match 9.5/10

8. 3 Way Dance Stevie Richards vs Sandman vs Terry Funk
This match is amazing the spots are great and this is just so hardcore that it even gets hard to watch at points some of the spots are just really hardcore I like this so much better than the 3 Way Dance at there last ppv because it is just better spots in it and it could have been longer but then Terry wouldn't have any gas left 9.5/10

9. World Championship Raven vs Terry Funk
This is I guess a match that is a bonus because it's not in the deal in the box so heres a present the match is pretty much storytelling but I still love watching it as Tommy breaks his promise to not help Terry and an insane table spot off the balcony 7.25/10

10. World Championship Barbed Wire Match Terry Funk vs Sabu
This is the most violent, brutal, insane bloodfest I've ever seen in my life the spots that are taken are so hard to watch it is the best Barbed Wire match I've ever seen it is just so hard but crazaly fun to watch 10/10

11. Beulah vs Alfonso
Wow this is just WOW I mean Bill almost bleeds to death and he is in there with Beulah but WOW it is actully pretty good with a couple of good moves and almost Alfonso's death 7.5/10

12. ECW Death Match FTW Title Taz vs Bam Bam Bigelow
This is a pretty good match as Taz and Bam Bam go allover the arena and they get back to the ring for some more good spots and then a spot that makes you think of there last encounter 7.25/10

13. ECW World Title Match Taz vs Shane Douglas
I would have rather seen their match from the ppv where Taz wins the belt but this is still a classic just like Paul said before the match 8.75/10

14. Chicago Street Fight Falls Count Anywhere ECW Tag Title Match thats a huge name for the match Dudleyz vs Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney
This Match maybe the most crazy of them all with the fire and dive and the tag team teamwork it's just really great 9.5/10

15. ECW World Title Mike Awesome vs LSD
This could have been a Table match exept it would have lasted 2 seconds but it wasn't so they use about 6 tables I think it's six but i'm not sure but I do know that this is an Awesome match and he dominates most of it but it never slows down too much so I just love it and thinks it's one of the best on these dvds 10/10

16. Rhino vs Sandman
This could have been left out not much here just a few ladder spots and sandman getting gored through a table 5/10

17. Three Way Dance Super Crazy vs Little Guido vs Yoshihiro Tajiri
This one is from ECW on TNN as was the last match and this one is worth it it's not violent but it's really good with everyone getting spots and just great wrestling 8.75/10

18. I Quit Match Tommy Dreamer vs C.W. Anderson
The match is ok and it goes to the outside which is a bit boring but then they return to the ring and I start to enjoy this one with many weapons the match is a little of a mess but not to bad and I love the finish it's something I would Quit to 8/10

19. Masato Tanaka vs Mike Awesome
This is from One Night Stand and it's really good but I would have rather seen one of their older matches instead of the new one because they had classics then too 9.5/10

Extra. Gangstas vs Public Enemy
The match is brutal with everyone bleeding after awhile and it's a pretty good match but it's just a spotfest a good last match for public enemy and they use bread and pies and joey says ""Rock with the pie, hes warming up for WCW"" I thought that was cleaver 7.25/10",1228694400,,5763,4.020979020979021
2478036,5,B000E0WJR8,"Bloodsport: ECW's Most Violent Matches

Three little letters say it all E-C-W, E-C-W, E-C-W

This is it! A 2 Disc DVD collection of some of the greatest matches in ECW history. Brutality at it's best mixed with some of the best wrestling in the industry that set the standard for the rest of the industry. Tables, chairs, ladders, Singapore canes, broken beer bottles... you name it, these guys have used it. This DVD takes a walk down memory lane of the glory days of Extreme Championship Wrestling. This set chronicles some of the early days of the original ECW all the way up to ECW One Night Stand 2005.

This collection of matches is unbelievable! I'm very surprised that they brought out some of the most brutal matches from the original ECW. Nothing short of pure athleticism, adrenaline and violence throughout this set. Along with a great list of extra bonus features, there is plenty for all on this set. Plus it's nice to hear the real story from guys like Joey Styles, Axl Rotten, the Dudley Boyz, Danny Doring, Amish Roadkill and others.

I highly recommend this set to anyone who loved the original ECW and anyone curious to what ECW was really about. I will say that this is set is NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART. Some of these matches are absolutely disturbing. The first time I watched the Taipei Death Match between Axl Rotten and Ian Rotten, I had to pause it a few times to shake it off because I was that disturbed by it and I have seen some honest to God brutal matches. Again, just be sure you can handle it because from there, it only gets worse in some spots.

Most everyone has done a decent job listing the matches so I'll just list some of the highlights for me:

Taipei Death Match
Axl Rotten v Ian Rotten
Great storyline and just complete brutality at it's best! This one isn't even a match, it's a drunken brawl with broken beer bottles.

Stretcher Match
RVD v Sabu
This match isn't over the top violent like some Sabu's other matches but its very physical with a lot of high-flying and RVD's martial arts skills are at an all time high in this match as well. Great match!

Barbed Wire Match (ECW Title)
Sabu v Terry Funk (champion)
 This match was just crazy! I seriously couldn't believe my eyes were seeing this. I had seen bits and pieces of this match before a long time ago but I had never seen it in its entirety and my God, to see that kind of passion for the business from these 2 was amazing. I can't name many other guys that I could see in this kind of match.
Chicago Street Fight (ECW Tag Team Titles)
The Dudley Boyz v Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney
""SAY HELLO TO MY LIL' FLAMING TABLE!"" That's all I need to say about this match.

I Quit Match
Tommy Dreamer v CW Anderson
I'm not a big fan of CW but the man put on a great match with Dreamer. If its one thing that Tommy can do, he can put on a hardcore clinic on anyone. This match was on the supposed ""last"" ECW PPV and at the time, what a way to go out.

ECW One Night Stand 2005
Masato Tanaka v Mike Awesome
OK, I'll be the first to say it, RIP Mike Awesome but when it comes to ECW, he sold out and to WCW of all brands. I couldn't stand that this became his legacy after some of things he did for ECW and then to just throw it away for a little money. That bothered me to no end and for years I hated the man. After this match, I changed my mind about him again and I gained a new respect for the man. He came out and got it done and put on an amazing show. And Masato Tanaka is always amazing as well so this match doesn't disappoint at all. The icing on the barbed wire cake!",1217462400,,3574,4.202919708029197

ECW Blood Sport- The Most Violent Matches
One of the more solid collections WWE has released. There are weak spots but overall the DVD is great. Paul Heyman does a great job hosting this DVD. I really like the crimson blood casing art. All the menus are easy to navigate and nice looking.

Disc 1

ECW World Tag Team Championship- Hardcore TV 8/27/94
Cactus Jack & Mikey Whipwreck VS Public Enemy(c)
I personally was not the biggest fan of this match. I big problem is there is only one camera so you can hardly see a lot of the action going on. The story is told well but there just isn't much here.
RATING- 4/10

Extreme Warfare Vol. 1 3/18/95
Sandman & Terry Funk VS Cactus Jack and Shane Douglass
Again, this is another case of not enough substance. Luckily there are two cameras now and watching it is easier. There are a lot of bad weapon shots and boredom. This is honestly more boring than the last match. It only picks up in the last few minutes because fire comes into play.
RATING- 3/10

Taipei Death Match- Hardcore Heaven 7/1/95
Ian Rotten VS Axl Rotten
This is where the DVD starts to pick up. The participants tape up their fists and dip them in glue. Then they dip their hands in broken glass. The match consists of them punching the [...] out of each other. They even throw some wicked chops on each other. Ian is bleeding out buckets and Axl is bleeding a lot as well. Good way to pick up this DVD.
RATING- 7.5/10

This is a decent match though, it's just not their best encounter.
RATING- 7/10

Four Corners Match- ECW Television Title- Heatwave 6/22/96
Shane Douglass VS Chris Jericho(c) VS 2 Cold Scorpio VS Pitbull #2
A lot of people love this match. No story is being told in this match at all though. The only thing going on is between Shane Douglass and Pitbull #2 and that's not much. Once it's down to them it's becomes interesting. Before that it's just a bunch of waiting for something to happen.
RATING- 6/10

Weapons Match- Hardcore Heaven 6/22/96
Tommy Dreamer VS Brian Lee
This is a great match. It goes all the way outside and stuff gets crazy. Dreamer is bleeding a good bit in this one. Lots of weapons used. Unlike the second match on this disk, most of the shots are decent. The after math of this match is awesome.
RATING- 8/10

Stretcher Match- The Doctor Is In 8/3/96 (Match of the DVD Award)
Rob Van Dam VS Sabu
This match starts a little slow and I wasn't expecting much. I was wrong, this turned into an amazing bout. There are lots of near finishes and high-flying action. This match is near epic.

Terry Funk VS Sandman VS Stevie Richards
The winner of this match will battle against Raven for the ECW title directly after this match. You will see both matches. This will be a rating of both combined since they are for the most part. The 3-way is really good. There are some brutal shots, including Sandman throwing a ladder into the ring and it landing right on Funk. Very solid match with the right person winning. Raven's match with the winner wasn't much. It told a great story though.
RATING- 8/10

Disc 2

Barbed Wire Match- ECW World Heavyweight Championship- Born to be Wired 8/9/97
Sabu VS Terry Funk(c)
This match is very gory. Sadly, it is a barbed wire match. It's the best barbed wire match I've seen, but barbed wire match don't tend to be that good. The ropes are replaced with barbed wire, which restricts a lot of what happens in the match. There are some sick spots and the ending, despite it being botched, is very gory.
RATING- 6/10

Intergender Match- As Good As It Gets 9/20/97
Beulah McGillicutty VS Bill Alfonso
This match is very interesting. Neither Alfonso nor Beulah are wrestlers. This match is short but it one of the better on this DVD. Alfonso bleeds buckets, literally. Beulah pulls off some decent moves. The match is very entertaining.

Introducing each match in his own colorful way is Paul Heyman, mastermind and leader of ECW during its heyday

The matches are all this incredible display of violence, tolerance, high flying moves, street-brawling, technical wrestling, even the intense athletics of luchadores and the beer, blood, and cigarettes of the Sandman, this DVD features 19 of the absolute best wrestling matches I have ever see and it's tragic that I most likely will not see many more like these ever again in the future.

Rather than recount all the matches like everyone else, I'll only recount my favorite ones:

Mexican Death Match: Rey Mysterio Vs. Psicosis
Sick of blood?  This is a spellbinding, bloodless match which sees these two luchadores pulling off astounding athletics, heavily technical wrestling and high flying.  The fighting moves up the ramp and a steel chair is used for Rey Mysterio to hurricanrana Psicosis from atop the ramp down onto the crowd area below.  You're literally hanging off your seat as Mysterio is dangling between standing and lying as the referee counts to 10, and has just barely passed nine when Mysterio starts to stand up.  A spectacular match which showcases the best of bloodless ECW

Stretcher Match: Rob Van Dam Vs. Sabu
Any match with Sabu and RVD is bound to be a spectacle.  In order to win this match, a man had to be carried away on a stretcher out of the ring and into the locker room.  These two pull off their best stunts, and there are plenty of laugh-worthy moments, especially towards the end with Sabu being carried away outside of the ring, RVD leaping off the turnbuckle only to hit bare stretcher as Sabu rolls off the stretcher, and the team starts carrying RVD away!  Sabu's win

Three Way Dance for #1 Contendership of ECW Title followed by ECW Title match: Sandman Vs. Stevie Richards Vs. Terry Funk
Commentated over by Joey Styles and Tommy Dreamer (rooting for Terry Funk), these three are amazing with their brawls and straight wrestling style.  I had a blast as Sandman whipped out a ladder and tossed it into the ring---right on Stevie Richards' head as he was on top of Terry Funk!  After Richards' is eliminated, Sandman and Funk shake hands and go at each other.  Weapons make their obvious appearance, including barbed wire, and Terry Funk wins the match, barely able to stand.

At that moment, the champion Raven comes out and begins their match immediately
ECW Championship: Raven Vs. Terry Funk
Terry Funk is barely able to stand and covered in blood when Raven starts on him.  At first this seems to be an utter squash match, but Terry is proving resilient, and with the crowd almost screaming for Tommy Dreamer to help him (he had previously promised Terry he wouldn't interfere).  Finally Tommy gets up to the roaring cheers of the audience, until one of the Dudley boys (not Buh Buh Ray or D-von or Spike---one of the others) comes out and attacks him.  Dreamer recovers and makes it to the ring, brutalizing Raven, and Funk amazingly wins the match and the title!  You can't help but at least feel slightly emotional as Funk is crowned ECW champion for the first time.

Barbed Wire Match: Terry Funk Vs. Sabu
An absolute classic.  This was the last barbed wire match ever done in ECW, but after this one, who needs another?  Plenty of thrills in the beginning watching these two beat at each other while trying to avoid the barbed wire surrounding the ring which had replaced the ropes, until Funk drops Sabu on his crotch directly onto the wire.  Such a bloody match with so much wire that paramedics feared to touch the wire wrapped around Funk's neck, thinking his neck would be lacerated and he'd bleed to death.

Chicago Street Fight: The Dudley Boyz Vs. Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley
I was kind of disappointed at the blatantly obvious blading (wrestling term for cutting your forehead so you'll look like you're bleeding from a hit) by Buh Buh Ray when he supposedly had his forehead grated with a cheese grater, but we all know why he fell out of the ring and went under the apron.  The violence of this match is astounding, and scenes like Spike Dudley leaping from one story off onto all three other men outside of the ring is only surpassed by the finishing touch---a powerbomb by the Dudleys on Balls Mahoney, through a table covered in thumbtacks and lit on fire!

ECW Championship: Mike Awesome Vs. Spike Dudley
Mike Awesome is almost 300 pounds and six and a half feet tall.  Spike Dudley is a full foot shorter, and at best, half that weight.  Now picture the two fighting, with several tables set up outside of the ring, and Mike Awesome's specialty is putting people through tables.  Despite being put through tables countless times (at least 5 or 6 times), Spike Dudley manages to fight back effectively, and we get an amazing match that is far from the typical WWE squash match (wrestling term for a match that ends quickly with one man dominating the other easily)

ECW One Night Stand 2005: Mike Awesome Vs. Masato Tanaka
I've never heard of Masato Tanaka; he's nowhere in any of the matches on this DVD or on Rise and Fall of ECW.  I knew nothing of Mike Awesome save for the few matches I've seen him in and his segment in Rise and Fall of ECW.  Joey Styles has some very harsh words about him in the commentary for this match.  While superstars from Raw and Smackdown (led apparently by JBL) watch from the rafters, Awesome and Tanaka put on possibly the best match of 2005 I've ever seen.  Chair shots to the head are all real and plenty of tables are broken by the duo.  So much violence, high flying, technical wrestling, and ECW style brawling leads the whole crowd to literally chant ""THIS MATCH RULES! THIS MATCH RULES! THIS MATCH RULES! THIS MATCH RULES!""  An excellent wind-up to this disc, with the most recent ECW match since the DVD was produced (in 2005).

With ECW gone, all we're left with is gems like this.  Where else can you see a man suplex a table onto another man, as opposed to the other way around?  This was the best wrestling DVD I've ever bought and I only regret that I paid so little for it.",1170374400,5,6348,4.630357142857143

1. Catcus Jack and Mikey Whipwreck vs. Public Enemy ECW World Tag Team Championship-This was a decent first match. This was just a match were cactus was taking Mikey under his wing but mikey did not want to wrestle. This was an okay match with a good story told as cactus and mikey were the under dogs and kept on kicking out including Public Enemy hitting there finshier through a table. Good solid match. Winners and new ECW World Tag Team Champs Catcus Jack and Mikey Whipwreck. Match Rating 7/10.
2. Sandman and Terry Funk vs. Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas- This was another solid tag team match. This match was a little bit different than the first one because it was more hardcore . There was everthing in this match including a flaming branding iron. Not much to say but a decent match. Winners Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas. Match Rating 7/10.
3. Axel Rotten vs. Ian Rotten in a Taipie Death Match- This was hard to call a match. The reason for that is this was more hardcore and brutal than anything. This was a match were you glue glass to your fist and try to punch each other out so you can get the pin. This is real glass which is the sick part. This is filled with blood. Match Rating 5/10.
4. Rey Mystero vs. Psicosis Mexican Death Match- This was another neat match. This is exactly like a texas death match were you have to pin your opponent first and than they have to stay down for a 10 count. This match was mostly controlled by Psicosis and Mystero trying to fight back. Not a bad match with some nice moves by both men. Winner Rey Mystero. Match Rating 7.5/10.
5. Shane Douglas vs. Chris Jericho vs. 2 Cold Scoripio vs. Pitbull # 2 in a elemination match for the ECW TV Title- Well if there is one thing that I can say about this match is its awesome. This in my opinion is the second best match on the dvd and you will see why. This was about a 40 minutes long and it is set up perfect. Just so many false finishes and a great storyline tagged on to it is just a great match to watch. Winner Shane Douglas. Match Rating 10/10.
6. Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee in a Weapons Match- This was just a very hardcore match. There is not a lot to say about this match except it is just a weapons spot fest. Its not bad and its worth a look. Winner Tommy Dreamer. Match Rating 6.5/10.
7. Rob Van Damn vs. Sabu in a Stretcher Match- This was a very good match. Anytime these two get in the ring with some sort of match stipulation added they don't disappoint. This just had a lot of nice high flying spots. There were some nice spots including a fisherman suplex through the table. Good match and given the right amount of time. Winner Sabu. Match Rating 8.5/10.
8. Terry Funk vs. Sandman vs. Stevie Richards in a 3-Way Dance #  contender for the ECW Title- This was yet another very good match. This was an elimination style match and was given plenty of time. Unlike the four way match this was a little more hardcore than that match. There were a lot of hardcore stuff including trash cans chairs and tables. One spot in the match is when Funk hits a moonsault off the top of the ladder. Great match. Winner Terry Funk. Match Rating 9/10.
9. Raven vs. Terry Funk for the ECW Title- This was not a great match siecne Funk had just finshed a match so it was not given as much time. Raven controlled this whole match and was more of a storyline than anything there was a nice high flying move by raven that put him through a table. Not much of a match but a nice way to end the whole match/ storyline. Winner and new ECW Champ Terry Funk. Match Rating 5/10.
10. Sabu vs. Terry Funk in a Barb Wire Match for the ECW Title- This was proboly one of the hardest matches you will ever have to watch in wrestling. There was a lot more than just barbwire there was tables and chairs as well. Not a bad match given enough time and I give both mens tons of effort for making this match work. Winner and new ECW Champ Sabu. Match Rating 9/10.
11. Beulah McGillicutty vs. Bill Alonso in a Intergender Match- This was a decent match but nothing top special. This was only a five minute match and it showed how tuff Bullah is. Some hardcore action but a quick 5 minute match. Winner Beulah McGillicutty. Match Rating 5/10.
12. Tazz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow in a ECW Death Match- This was a very good match. This is only a few of the matches that I had seen tazz wrestle and it was a good match. There was a lot of hardcore action in this match including some nice chair and table spots. Tazz looked really good delivering suplexs. The sick moment was near the end and I will let you see that for yourself. Winner Tazz. Match Rating 7.5/10.
13. Tazz vs. Shane Douglas Ecw World Title Match- This was acculaty a rematch of there match a week earlier. This was a very solid match. This was not so much hardcore ECW action but more solid wrestling with suplexs and stuff. There was a nice moment were tazz hit a german suplex through a table in the corner and he hit some more suplexs through tables. Good stuff. Winner and still ECW Champ Tazz. Match Rating 7.5/10.
14. The Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney for the  ECW World Tag Team titles- This was a very good match and was on tv. This match just had everything in it from chesse graters to chairs tacks flaming tables everything. This match just flowed really well and had a lot of high risk spots even in the crowd. There was a sick powerbomb through a burining table with tacks on it. Great tv match. Winners and still World tag team champs The Dudley Boyz. Match Rating 8.5/10.
15. Mike Awsome vs. Spike Dudley for the ECW World Title- This was basicly a david vs. golith type match. Spike Dudley finnaly got a title match but awesome controlled almost the whole match. This match mainly featured a lot of sick moves on spike as he went through numerous amounts of tables and sick chair shots. Not a bad match. Winner and still ECW champ Mike Awsome. Match Rating 7/10.
16. Rhino vs. Sandman- This was just a tv match and nothing to special here. Some nice hardcore action but it is nothing taking another look for. Winner Rhino. Match Rating 5.5/10.
17. Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido in a 3 Way Dance- This was like there match at ecw one ngiht stand 20005. There is nothing wrong with this match as all it is non stop action. You will enjoy this one. Winner Super Crazy. Match Rating 8/10.
18. Tommy Dreamer vs. C.W. Anderson in an  I quit match- This was another decent match. This was the last ppv ever for the original ECW. These two brought it to each other and gave the crowd something htat they could enjoy. Just a bloody match here lots of weapons and a great way to close out the last ever ECW ppv. Winner Tommy Dreamer. Match Rating 7.5/10.
19. Mike Awsome vs. Masato Tanaka- This match is actually my favorite on the disk. There is nothing in this match that you won't like. These guys literally killed each other to put on a show for the crowd. Lots of hardcore action I wil let you see it for yourself. Winner Mike Awsome. Match Rating 10/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give ECW Most Violent matches DVD a grade of 141/190 which is a 74% which means this is an awesome DVD. You have to pick this DVD up. It is worth its money and you will enjoy this. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for you time.",1156118400,,7409,4.2968526466380546
2478075,4,B000E0WJR8,"Ok I like the DVD, it was worth the $18 I paid for it. Some fo the matches are great. The barbed wire match, and the Taipei death match are alone worth the price. There are a few great wrestling matches on this DVD. Also a few matches aren't so bloody but the wrestlers take a huge toll on there bodies.

What I didn't like was where did all the brutal matches go? Blood pouring from one another? No New Jack?  I won't lie when I hear ECW's Most Violent Matches I want to see some massive bleeding!

If I had to pick between this and TNA best and bloodiest, I would go with TNA.

Ok pick them both up and enjoy :)",1154563200,,613,3.959349593495935

Mexican Death Match

Psichosis vs. Rey Mysterio:

A very high flying match that had Rey take a pounding throughout the entire match.

Stetcher Match

Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu:

Another classic between these two. The only way to win was to roll your opponent out of the building on a stetcher.

ECW Tag Team Championships

Chicago Street Fight

Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley vs. The Dudley Boyz:

This is one of my favorites! A true fight that had forks, chairs, tables, thumbtacks, and fire in it. Spike Dudley, bloody face and all, jumps off a section of the stadium onto The Dudleyz and even his own tag team partner. They fight back in the ring and the Dudleyz get taken out by steel chairshots by Balls Mahoney. Balls pulls out a table and pours lighter fluid on it but The Dudleyz counter and put Balls through the table that they set on fire! The Dudleyz wins. 9/10

Rhyno vs. The Sandman:

Short match, only thing worth remembering is Rhyno goring Sandman through a table in the end. 6/10 Really short match.

Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido:

Great fast paced match. Lot of back and forth action and a lot of near falls by all three men. Super Crazy even does a moonsault out of the ring onto both Tajiri and Guido. Little Guido is the first to go, then Super Crazy gets the pin on Tajiri. 9/10

I Quit Match

Tommy Dreamer vs. C.W. Anderson:

This was a vicious fight. Both men get cut open with tools, chairs, razor wire, and tables.

Dreamer uses parts of the table to make Anerson say, ""I Quit!"" 8.5/10

Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka:

This was from last years One Night Stand ppv. Great match with a lot of tables used. Tanaka gets thrown through a table set up against the guardrail, then gets vicious chairshots by Awesome. However Awesome gets DDT'd by Tanaka through another table off the top rope! They continue to fight and Tanaka gets thrown out of the ring through a table on the outside! Awesome wins. 10/10

This DVD brings back alot of good ECW memories for all of the old school fans.  Terry Funk celebrating with Tommy Dreamer after beating Raven to become the champion is still one of the best thins I have ever seen in wrestling.  This DVD also contains the greatest match in the history of wrestling, the Sabu vs. Terry Funk Barbed Wire match from Born to be Wired.  The only thing I didn't like was that it included the Buela/Alfonso match and none of New Jack's matches.

Cactus Jack & Mikey Wipewreck vs. The Public Enemy- 6/10

This one is old-school ECW. I really didn't care for this match. But it is worth a view or two.

The Sandman & Terry Funk vs. Cactus Jack & Shane Douglas- 7.5/10

This one is a very violent brawl. Some sick shots for the kendo stick but can you say flaming branding iron. That makes this match worth viewing alone.

Taipei Death Match

Ian Rotten vs. Axl Rotten- 9/10

WOW now this is extreme. The two men have there fists glued with glass on them. A very bloody brawl. You have to see this one.

Mexican Death Match

Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis- 7/10

This one is okay. Check the one out on the The Rise and Fall of ECW DVD. It's better.

Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 vs. 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Chris Jericho- 8.5/10

This is a long match but worth every minute. The best spot is when the pitbulls put Francine through a table.

Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee- 8/10

This a typical hardcore match going all around the arena and using every thing in sight. The end part is insane. I'm not gonna give it away.

Stretcher Match

RVD vs. Sabu- 9-10

Possibly the best match put one between these guys. Very physical. Highflying action.

Terry Funk vs. The Sandman vs. Stevie Richards- 8.5

The winner of this match gets a chance to face Raven afterwards for the championship. Which is included in this match

Tazz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow- 9/10

What a match this one is insane. You have to watch this one.

Tazz vs. Shane Douglas- 8/10

I can't rember much of this one. All I can rember is that it is a very tentical match.

The Dudley Boyz vs. Balls Mahoney & Spike Dudley- 9/10

Nice match. Very Hardcore. And can you say flaming table

Mike Awesome vs. Spike Dudley- 9/10

This one uses a lot of tables. How is Spike still living.

Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido- 8.5/10

Great Match. Nice action by everyone. This one isn't like the one in the ECW PPV because there isn't alot of outside action from the managers.

Tommy Dreamer vs. C.W. Anderson- 8.5/10

This one takes place at the last ECW PPV. Great Spots.

2478108,4,B000E0WJR8,"the only reason i only gave this awesome dvd 4/5 stars was the barbed wire match was a huge let down. i expected some off the walls crazy in your face action, but the match went so slow and there was not enough action to give me the ""holy sh@t"", searously this match made the brock lesner/goldberg match at wrestlemania 20 look good...

but for the rest of the dvd it rocked, there should of been more taz matches on it though...",1141948800,,429,4.2317073170731705
2478109,4,B000E0WJR8,"A five star DVD deserves a five star superstar. No Raven, no 5 stars. But a great DVD still. I'd recomend it. Especially to people who think it's all fake. Yeah, it's scripted, but how do you learn how to fall off a 35 foot balcony? You don't learn it. You just do it when the cameras are rolling and that takes guts, courage and b@ll$.",1141171200,,336,4.106060606060606
2478110,5,B000E0WJR8,"If you were to talk to any die-hard wrestling fan and ask what ECW means to them, you will find that it means a lot more than just Extreme Championship Wrestling.  To most, ECW means the true definition of hardcore wrestling at its most brutal and most bloody.  When the WWE bought ECW and thusly gained the entire ECW wrestling library, it learned that what it called ""hardcore wrestling"" was just a mere pale imitation of what ECW brought to the table.

When the WWE held ECW's One Night Stand last year, the fans got what they felt ECW rightfully deserved: the right to say what should have been a proper goodbye when ECW folded in 2001, and also to serve notice to those who had thought that the WWE was the lone survivor of what would be considered the big 3 promotion wars: ECW cannot and will not die!

In the 3rd official ECW video collection, ECW founder Paul Heyman went through the ECW library and chose 19 of the most brutal and most hardcore matches in ECW history, from ECW's infancy in the early 90's all the way up to the rebirth at One Night Stand.  Heyman also introduces each match and gives some slight background into the feuds and battles behind each match.

Some standout matches include: A Taipei Death Match between Ian Rotten and his brother Axl (imagine taping up your hands, dipping them in super glue and then dipping them in BROKEN GLASS, and then going into a fight!), a classic intergender match between Beulah and Bill Alfonso, an ECW World Heavyweight Championship title match between Spike Dudley and Mike Awesome that sees Dudley go through more tables than should be humanly allowed, A match for the Tag Team titles that ends with someone going through a table SET ON FIRE, and much more.

Needless to say, the collection includes bonus features, alternate commentary on one match, and a music video.  But this is definitely not for those with weak stomachs for blood, as with several matches the blood flows freely and often. Additionally, the discs are rated TV-MA for strong language and violence.

So if you already have Rise and Fall of ECW and One Night Stand, this definitely is an essential part of your ECW collection. Oh yes, there will be blood...and tables, chairs, barbed wire, cheese graters, ladders...",1140566400,,2254,4.671717171717172
2478111,5,B000E0WJR8,"This DVD is one of the best i have ever seen. The level of extreme has NEVER been this intense. I was on the edge of my seat from the moment Mikey Shipwreck hit Rocko Rock over the head with a board, all the way to Tommy Dreamer hitting the Death Valley Driver to C.W. Anderson through the table. I saw quite possibly the most gruesome match in my life, which was none other than the barbed-wire match between Sabu and Terry Funk. But there were several other matches that astounded me, such as: RVD vs. Sabu in a stretcher match, Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee in a weapons match, Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis in a Mexican Death match, Beulah McGuillicutty vs. Bill Alfonso, and last but so far from least, the Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney. If you look up extreme in the dictionary, you need to add a mental image of Sabu and RVD, because the were just that in their stretcher match. Tommy Dreamer and Brian Lee's match didn't so much amaze as what happened after did. Tommy was choke-slammed right off of a balcony through 3 or 4 tables. Rey Mysterio and Psicosis weren't TOO violent, but were just flyin' all over the place. Beulah absolutely destroyed Bill Alfonso; which is pretty funny seeing a girl kicked that much tail. And the Dudley Boyz match was just awesome as we saw a flaming table come out. But those most deinetly aren't all of the matches; there are 19 in all along with several extras.

  Basically if you are an ECW fan, or even just a fan of wrestling in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. It is absolutely worth it's $15-$20 price tag. Just be warned that it earns it's TV-MA rating, because this one isn't for the squemish crowd. It will most definetly make you want to chant: E-C-W!! E-C-W!! E-C-W!! right along with the fans.",1140307200,3,1781,4.407294832826747
2478112,4,B000E0WJR8,"Okay, I've been a fan of ECW since I first saw Barely Legal in 1997, and I've gone to see them many times in Queens, NY.  But I gotta be honest with you - when I think of the most violent ECW matches, you can't think about them without thinking about New Jack.  Hello, did anyone forget about Living Dangerously 2000, and that fall during his match w/ Vic Grimes?  What about Steve Corino and Jerry Lynn at Heat Wave 2000, where Corino's busted open so badly that Lynn picks up enough blood to write D-I-E?  Don't get me wrong - I love the selections of matches, but the Tanaka/Awesome match at One Night Stand could have been omitted since ONS is already on DVD.  I would have thought the Dreamer/Funk vs. Raven/Cactus match would have been on it, but then again, it's already released on Foley's Hits and Misses.  All in all, though, the matches are great, and the picture is better than what was originally seen on MSG.  I believe this DVD is for any fan of ECW, or pro-wrestling in general.  The product itself is great, and a very good representation of what ECW was all about.  Enjoy.",1139788800,5,1090,4.383084577114428
2478133,4,B000E0WJR8,"This DVD offers up great material for anyone who didn't watch ECW back in the height of their popularity. This will definitley save you from spending Ebay bucks for the same product. But in my opinion this DVD has a few minor problems. First of all most of these matched have been released on DVD before. Secondly there are some matches that really don't fall under the category of violent. Why is there a match with Beulah vs. Bill Alfonso but not one single match with New Jack? The match is absolutely terrible. And lastly, some of the matches really show how amateur some of the wrestlers were from a technical angle. There are times when Tazz's foot doesnt even make close contact to someone he's supposedly kicking. But if you can get past those obstacles you will see some very entertaining hardcore matches. Anything with Sandman, Sabu or RVD is completely over the top. Worth the price if you don't already have ECW DVD's.",1139788800,3,931,4.648484848484848
2478134,5,B000E0WJR8,"Despite the fact that its WWE owned now, I have to give WWE a little credit in that at least they recognize that ECW, years after its demise, still has power!

ECW: Bloodsport featured matches that I've never seen before so I was happy to pay $18 bucks to purchase it! Here are the matches:

DISC 1

Catcus Jack & Mikey Whipwreck Vs. Public Enemy (ECW World Tag Team Championship Match) - I am not sure but I think ECW was still EASTERN CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING at this point. Even back in those days though, it was already EXTREME! The match itself sees Mikey take a beating as well as Catcus but still pulls off an upset against the favored P.E.

Sandman & Terry Funk Vs. Cactus Jack and Shane ""Franchise"" Douglas - A wild affair from 1995 which saw the introduction of the flaming branding iron!

Axl Rotten Vs. Ian Rotten (Taipei Death Match) - Taking a page from the Jean Claude Van Damn movie ""Kickboxer"", these two have an anything goes match with taped fists mixed with superglue and beer glass! VERY BLOODY BOUT!

Rey Mystero, Jr. Vs. Psicosis (Mexican Death Match) - These two went at in a match where you must answer a 10 count or lose the bout! Similiar to a ""Last Man Standing"" match but you must gain a pinfall or submission prior to the 10 count!

Shane ""Franchise"" Douglas Vs. Chris ""Lionheart"" Jericho Vs. 2 Cold Scorpio Vs. Pitbull #2 (ECW TV Title Match) - This was done Four Corners style where you had to tag in and out. It went on until only one man remained! This match saw Douglas win the TV title and the beginning of a long team-up with Francine, who turned on Pitbull #2 during this match.

Tommy Dreamer Vs. Brian Lee (Weapons Match) - The former fake ""Undertaker"" gives his biggest moment in his time in ECW as he choked-slammed Tommy Dreamer though about 4 or 5 tables to the concrete floor!

Rob Van Damn Vs. Sabu (Stretcher Match) - Not really bloody but very physical, especially in the last 10 minutes!

Terry Funk Vs. Sandman Vs. Stevie Rchards (3-Way Dance #1 Contender's Match) - This was at the first ECW PPV called Barely Legal in 1997! You will also see the winner take on then-ECW champ Raven immediately following this match as well! Classic ECW bout!

DISC 2

Sabu Vs. Terry Funk (Barbed Wire Match/ECW Title) - A match so violent, even Paul Heyman didn't want to see another!

Beulah McGillicutty Vs. Bill Alfonso (Intergender Match) - Very bloody bout! Surprisingly vicious!

Tazz Vs. Bam Bam Bigelow (ECW Death Match) - These two had two PPV matches and in my book this one was overall the better of the two!

Tazz Vs. Shane Douglas (ECW World Title Match) - Okay match but the one from Guilty As Charged '99 a week earlier was better! My only guess why they didn't use this match was because it featured the late Chris Candido running in as well as Tammy Lynn Sytch (Sunny) but then again, that's never stopped WWE before so who knows!

The Dudley Boyz Vs. Spike Dudley & Balls Mahoney (ECW World Tag Team Title Match) - This was made a Chicago Street Fight match with an ending reminisent of the Dudleyz' bout with Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman at the recent ECW One Night Stand!

Mike Awesome Vs. Spike Dudley (ECW World Title Match) - HOW THE HELL IS SPIKE NOT DEAD AFTER THIS MATCH?! He had his moments but Awesome really destroyed him!

Rhino Vs. Sandman - Not a bad bout from ECW on TNN.

Super Crazy Vs. Tajiri Vs. Little Guido (3 Way Dance) - These three always put on a great show together and this match is no exeception!

Tommy Dreamer Vs. C.W. Anderson (""I Quit"" Match) - Very physical bout! Features alternate commentary from ""The Coach"" and Tommy Dreamer himself who admits he watched the legendary Magnum T.A. Vs. Tully Blanchard ""I Quit"" bout to get ready for this match!

Mike Awesome (RIP) Vs. Masato Tanaka - Their recent bout from ECW One Night Stand!

While there are things about this collection that could've been better (and I do agree that the Mastato Tanaka/Mike Awesome match should've been left off since its already available on ECW One Night Stand), I am over all pleased with this since I only saw ECW in its latter days so any footage I can get my hands on, I am glad to get!

UPDATE 2/20/07:
I should report that Mike Awesome recently passed away at age 42. While viewed as a traitor by ""original"" ECW fans, he DID put on great matches and (along with Masato Tanaka) put on the best match at ECW One Night Stand 2005! He will be missed.",1139702400,62,4805,4.485057471264367
2478135,5,B000E0WJR8,"I'm interested in buying but one thing urks me, the time of the chapters.  I've noticed that some of the matches last less than it's actual time that it happened, some shorter than 30 seconds.  Can anyone shed some light on this?

It's getting a 5 out of me because it is ECW but I don't know what the WWE has done with the footage.",1139443200,,332,4.076923076923077

I also loved watching wcw, and still love watching wwe. I think tna is ok, but it remindes me of all the reasons wcw failed. When I watch tna it seems like an old wcw show, shot everytime with the same small scale crowd. But ecw,wcw,& wwe made the 90's a great time to be a wrestling fan after what we suffered through for some of the late 80's and early 90's. It revived the world of wrestling the same way the flair and hogan did in the early and mid 80's. Also a side note, Scott Hall's first break was in the awa, as was hbk's, as Cowboy Scott Hall. So be sure to check out wwe's best of the awa(coming soon). Also this ecw dvd is great, I loved it. E-C-DUB, E-C-DUB,E-C-DUB.",1139270400,2,833,3.9940119760479043
2478138,4,B000E0WJR8,"Don't worry, there is a second volume coming out.  But I myself don't have those original ECW DVDs because I didn't care for the production value on them.  Hopefully this will be nicer, and hopefully vol 2 will have some of the more violent ones like Sandman vs Sabu stairway to hell match where Sabu breaks his jaw and continues to wrestle.  Or that scafolding match where Saturn blew out his elbow when he did an elbow drop off the scafold.  Or even the match with that bogus wrestler who never wrestled and got the holy hell beat out of him... I can't remember his name.",1139270400,,573,4.377358490566038

But the DVD set includes none of the gruesome work of new jack, none of the really crazy s*** the dudleyz did, and it only has I think 2 matches from the hammerstein ballroom days.

8103641,3,B000E0WJR8,"As someone who actually bought ECW commercial tapes direct from ECW and Global Distributor back in the mid to late 1990's
these tapes had no box art they had the white label and were in a plain white box!
I know the real ECW product
This set is average at best mostly due to the fact none of this footage is (real exclusive)
Instead of the WWE doing the smart thing and putting out official remastered commercial tapes (Fans gets this)
It's a glorified best of/greatest hits set
When you have a WWE Logo at the start of a ECW release something is seriously wrong
and having Paul Heyman host this release  is downright a spit in the face since Paul E. sold ECW to Vince and the WWF years before anyone even knew (The ECW Raw invasion was not so much a invasion more like dark matches)  he also  screwed over half the wrestlers during the last year of ECW
Paul Heyman is nothing more then a snake oil salesman that came into Tri State/Eastern Championship Wrestling forced Eddie Gilbert out! Got major heat with the NWA  and stuck a knife into Tod Gordon to take over ECW
Paul is God really not even close.....
The footage is not uncut the licensed music has been edited out
also some of these matches are not the most violent
The Mexican deathmatch is good with plenty of great spots (but, it's a Lucha match)
The stretcher match between Sabu and RVD is a solid spot feast too
ECW Deathmatch from Heatwave 98 with Taz and Bam Bam good not violent
Taz vs Shane Douglas from hardcore tv (good solid match not hardcore)
ECW on TNN 2-25-00 Rhino vs Sandman (PG-13 match TNN censored everything put on there network)

Why no mention of the mass transit incident?
Why not take the footage out of Heyman's vault of The Sandman/Raven crucifixion incident and use that to push this re-hash
