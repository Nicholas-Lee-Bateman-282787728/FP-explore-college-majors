8335383,5,B000OQDUL6,"This DVD makes me actually laugh out loud (as few shows do). I love it! There are no commercials or interruptions once the program starts. The gags are short and truly funny. I hope they make more of these, as I have bought all they have made. If you are stressed and need something to cheer you up, get this DVD.",1365638400,,313,4.147540983606557
