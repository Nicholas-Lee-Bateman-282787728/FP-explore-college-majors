8567507,1,B00BF25HJG,Im not even sure where to start on this... Im a HUGE fan of sullys but the guy before me kind of nailed how i felt about it. I haven't opened the cd yet so i don't know if the disc is missing. The fact of the rubber bands and inserts is sad. Also my live cd is missing tracks. The signed poster came squished and creased. As well as the hat came all misshapen.,1415404800,,360,3.8133333333333335
8567508,5,B00BF25HJG,"Love Sully and this music is hauntingly relaxing.  DVD 's were great, love seeing the music performed. I had his book but loaned it and never got it back, so happy to have a copy again",1392422400,,184,4.111111111111111
8567509,1,B00BF25HJG,I was expecting a nice well made box that would be sealed. It was a card board box that the inserts did not fit well in and the lid did not close evenly. Some of the item were in the box and some were rubber band together and not in the box. The only sealed item was a cd and when i opened it the CD was missing.  What an absolute pile of junk I would be embarrassed to sell this item or put my name on it. Do not buy this item save your money.,1390089600,,444,3.625
8567510,2,B00BF25HJG,"Missing items in the set. Received it as a much wanted Xmas gift! Been a lifelong fan.  However,  VERY disappointed that I didn't receive what was advertised & I can't seem to get in touch with anyone to fix the problem! Soooooo disappointing! I know Sully Erna's better than this to his fans.  He just needs to get on ""his people"" to fix these careless mistakes ASAP!  Even more disappointing when I read that this is happening to other fans as well! Sully, all we're asking is that ""us"" fans get what we were promised & even MORE important....what we paid for!",1388361600,,562,4.480392156862745
8567511,5,B00BF25HJG,"The consummate performer releases a solo album and then a box set???  I almost fainted when I opened it to find all of the treasures within!  It is an amazing look at the musical life and a glimpse into the personal life of my favorite artist!  This is a far cry from the Sully of Godsmack and a great one at that!  I was first a little apprehensive about buying his solo album thinking it wasn't my taste...slowly I found myself listening and then more intently incorporating the CD into every facet of my day.  I started running recently and the Avalon album has the perfect mixture for the beginning runner.  I love Sully.  Always will, always have.  He's a great person when you meet him in person, so quiet and appreciative of his fan base.  His energy is calm and a little nervous, if I'm being honest...almost as if he is as in awe of his fans as we are of him.  I don't know him personally, but feel that if I did, he would definitely be the sort of person who would kick back with a beer and add value to any conversation.  Thsi box set gives the fans a real look into his world.  I appreciate his revelations!  If you're a Godsmack fan, and you like rock ballads, this will NOT disappoint you...if you're a Godsmack fan, and you like some great in your face lyrics, this will NOT disappoint you...if you're a Godsmack fan, this WILL NOT disappoint you!  Lisa Guyer is an amazing vocalist and Sully's humble nature allows for Lisa to shine as well.  Couldn't ask for more!",1383782400,2,1481,4.354014598540146
8567512,5,B00BF25HJG,"I have wanted to purchase this limited edition box set for quite awhile.  I also really wanted to win the ""golden ticket"" that is in some of the packages.  Didn't get a golden ticket...bummer.  But I love Sully Erna and his Godsmack band.  He is so talented.  Also, he is a good person.",1380499200,,286,4.320754716981132
8567513,4,B00BF25HJG,"I love this box set.  The videos are great, the CD's are great. All the other doodads are a nice touch.

My box set however was missing Sully's book and upon trying to contact the seller I never received a response nor a resolution. Very disappointing.",1367712000,2,252,4.456521739130435
8567514,5,B00BF25HJG,"You can tell that Sully Erna really cares about his fans. This box set proves it. First is the packaging.  It looks like a special wooden treasure box.  You open it up and it is full of treasure.  His first solo effort is a treasure in its self.  But to present it in cd,the making of it on dvd, a live preformance dvd along with a live recording on cd.  It truly was the gift of his music.",1366675200,,390,3.948717948717949
8567515,5,B00BF25HJG,"In typical Sully Erna fashion, Avalon is a work of art. If you've never seen the concert or heard the CD, I highly suggest you do. Everything from the African Tribe inspired beats and sounds to each heatfelt and handwritten lyric is awe inspiring. ""My Life"" is probably on of the best songs on the album, but to be honest there is not a bad one. I've had the CD and have already ordered 4 of the box sets as gifts. As Sully says, you have to experience the gift of music. I've shared the gift of music. Amazing album, great stuff in the box set. Typical Sully Erna style.",1364256000,6,571,4.2
