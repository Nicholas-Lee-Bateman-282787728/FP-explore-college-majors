If you are not a fan of P!nk before you see this concert, trust me, you will be after!!!",1178755200,4,256,3.9038461538461537
2761920,5,B000NA223K,Wow! only 2 reviews on this awesome dvd! I love P!nk and saddly have never seen her live. I do hope one day I will get the chance. If I were to choose which live dvd of P!nks to get I would choose this for the fact that I love the setlist for this tour. My favorite part of the concert is P!nks version of Whats Up by 4 Non Blondes. P!nk really makes the song her own. Other standouts include Fingers and the finale Get the party started for the acobatics alone. Watching P!nk twirling around dangerously in the air 30 feet above the stage is definitely a spectacle not to miss. Not only does it show that P!nk is an artist but she is truly a performer! I love P!nk!,1178236800,,666,4.053030303030303

2761926,5,B000NA223K,"Unlike the European video (which sucks!!!) this DVD presents the performance as a Pink concert rather than the herky-jerky s***e of the former. She has gathered some great musicians and dancers to her, most of which are with her for the Funhouse tour (her best so far methinks). Great show altogether. It's great to watch her develop as a performer and ""showman"" as her career grows. She's the best out there today.  Maybe one of the best ever.",1477526400,,444,4.6923076923076925

2761957,5,B000NA223K,"Awesome concert by a phenomenal performer! Until I'd seen her perform live I had no idea of her extraordinary degree of talent. I know of nobody who works harder to please an audience than Pink. I was exhausted and out of breath just from merely watching her do it all. This girl must be in incredible physical condition!

She performs everything from Led Zeppellin to old fashioned ballads. When you see her on a trapeze 30 feet above the stage singing her heart out as she performs aerial acrobatics without skipping a beat it is absolutely breathtaking!

She does things that no other popular vocal performer would even think of attempting and then pulls them off with aplomb.

If all you know of Pink is what songs of hers you might hear on the radio, you have no idea of what an astounding talent she is. ""Live"" is where she truly shines.  Once you see this concert on DVD, I promise you that you will want to see her live in concert--in person--the next time she comes to your area.",1411776000,,988,4.472222222222222

2761981,5,B000NA223K,"True P!nk fans will get this DVD! It has many AWESOME P!nk songs that are performed live (and many people believe that she sounds better live??? perhaps she does, perhaps she doesn't!) This is from her I'm Not Dead tour, which, fans must realize, is limited to songs that she had released before Funhouse. The track list for this DVD is: Trouble, Just Like A Pill, Who Knew, I'm Not Dead, Stupid Girls, Spanish Dance, There You Go, God Is A DJ, Fingers, Family Portrait, The One That Got Away, Dear Mr. President, What's Up, U + UR Hand, 18 Wheeler, Don't Let Me Get Me, Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely), Nobody Knows, Get The Party Started. This is the last concert from her I'm Not Dead tour, which happened to occur in Wembley Arena, where many other famous artists have DVDs from (Pink Floyd, Queen, etc.) It is not foreign ground for frequent music listeners.
The DVD is almost, if not even more, fun than the albums. P!nk has many tricks up her sleeve that not even the biggest P!nk fan could have predicted. Not even the strongest fortune teller would be able to predict the awesome stunts and tricks P!nk performs on-stage in this special DVD.
The DVD is equal in fun and lyrics! The DVD is light and fun, and P!nk bellows out the lyrics to some of her greatest songs (excluding those from Funhouse and The Truth About Love), proving once again that she is NOT afraid to swear in her music and truly speak her mind. Way to go P!nk on another great concert DVD!",1352332800,,1463,4.4222222222222225

2761983,5,B000NA223K,"Pink is punk!  From the beginning to the end, her presence is powerful and she commands the stage.  She struts her stuff. She dances, prances, and skips around onstage.  She does her acrobatics and still sings while in the air.  And she seems to have an almost endless youthful energy that just entertains you.  She can be uplifting or downbeat, professional or raw, sexy or foul-mouthed.  That woman is certainly not shy in showing off her buff body or in explaining her beliefs. I never knew who she was until I saw this concert.  And she really does have an amazing voice.

She is occasionally explicit in words and in deed on at least two songs, but not overly so (for some people) and it is within context.  For example, she has certain views and some not so nice words, including one specific perjorative, regarding a certain person.  One can always fast forward.  On another song, she may be too sexy and suggestive for the prudent-minded wholesome family or young kids.",1314144000,,977,4.654970760233918

I received this purchase for my birthday, and I cannot stop watching it. It is in excellent condition, very impressed with the service. It would have received a full 5 stars, but unfortunately, I paid more for the post and package, as it said it would be delivered between 8-16 days, but I am sure it was just over this time limit and I was worried about whether it would arrive in time for my birthday. Furthermore, I don't think you should have to pay more to deliver it quicker, as it obviously wasn't delivered quicker, I feel all purchases should be delivered as soon as possible.

However, overall I am one very happy customer, thankyou so much amazon.com!

2762017,5,B000NA223K,This is like a permanent memory for me as I saw her show in Auckland .What a lady What a star she is such a great act .What I loved about her performance was her smile and her laughter she really enjoys making things happen. For such a hard working singer she never lets up for one minute on stage giving her all to the audience. She had us laughing at her moan about her camp fire which due to insurance she had to use a broken light bulb and tissue paper but the effect was still brillilant. Having seen her swinging out over the audience she is truely a trooper and I hope she never changes .Great songs great routines just one helluva night .As  singer she is herself and as she says in Cuz I Can there aint no one like her .buy this it is something to enjoy on those cold winter nights and hot summer days and believe me if you haven't seen her live its one way to share the Pink experience,1181865600,,895,4.056497175141243

I saw this concert live in Sydney, I actually went twice is was so fabulous. This dvd captures the magic of her concert and if you've seen it live I would buy as a keepsake to relive the memory of the BEST concert ever & if you didn't make it to her concert, do yourself a favour and pick up a copy of this dvd gem.

The only complaint I have is the behind the scenes features was fairly short.

I absolutely love P!nk and Love this Dvd! Buy the explicit version so you don't get the occasionally swearing beeped out.

BUY IT! P!NK SAYS ROCK N ROLL Y'ALL! :-)",1181260800,2,720,4.233576642335766

2762020,5,B000NA223K,"This is the must-have concert from the amazing P!nk, featuring 2 hours of video and 21 great live tracks. The big surprise for me on this concert was the addition of some incredible circus-class acrobatics, as P!nk sings live while doing some very demanding stunts suspended 50 feet above the stage, no net,in a routine I could only compare to Cirque de Soleil. This woman is in top physical shape, and her vocals have never been better. From heart-wrenching ballads like ""Dear Mister President"" to pop-rock like ""Get the Party Started"" and ""Trouble"", this eclectic performer is definitely on top!

I purchased this disc from Amazon to get the UN-EDITED version. It is not that I crave explicit lyrics, P!nk does not use them to excess, but does not hold back when it is appropriate to her statement, and I just cannot see buying a concert that is bleeped as found at WMart. Why they can sell uncut splatter films, but feel compelled to censor musical artists is beyond me...Amazon comes through with the uncut version as the artist intended. Even on this ""explicit contents"" disc there are a couple of bleeps in the bonus feature footage probably because it aired on MTV, but at least none during the concert itself.",1179964800,47,1217,4.767772511848341

This isn't just a live concert...this is a HIGH-ENERGY, nothing held back, combination of pure raw vocal talent, dance theater, and amazing acrobatics. P!nk displays total control of her body and her voice. This is a great DVD to watch while you're walking on a treadmill...truly motivating and energizing.

In all senses of the word, P!NK ROCKS!!!!!",1179705600,10,530,4.824175824175824

2762023,5,B000NA223K,"What's not to love about this dvd?  If you were lucky enough to see P!nk perform in her ""I'm not dead"" tour, then this dvd is for you.  And if you weren't lucky enough, then you need to own this NOW, because it's just like the concert, you'll get to experience it just like we did in the audiences.  I have seen her once in Adelaide already, and will be seeing her two more times in the next two weeks!  YES PEOPLE, this concert is that good!!!

From the second the show starts you will be captivated by her energy, her songs, her sexiness, and the music.  She sounds just like she does on her cd - raw, husky, sexy, and pure talent.

Highlight would have to be Dear Mr President, Fingers, Get the Party started, Leave me alone with her dorky dance!!!  Actually, the whole concert is a highlight!!!!

You need to buy this NOW!  I watch mine at least 3 times a week!",1179014400,,865,4.1878787878787875
