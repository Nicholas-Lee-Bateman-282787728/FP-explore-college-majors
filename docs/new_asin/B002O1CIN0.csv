8375831,5,B002O1CIN0,"This is the ultimate ""niche"" show.  Either you're a fan of Corey Haim or Corey Feldman or both, or you wouldn't have much interest in watching these two seasons of scripted/unscripted episodes.  Each episode is precisely 22 minutes.  There's no menu, no extras, no previews, no bonus features.  You put the DVD in your player and the show begins immediately; and ends just as unceremoniously 22 minutes later.  As to how much is scripted, how much is unscripted: who can say?  When you have a show about two grown men whose entire lives are a product of Hollywood, truth and fiction eventually merge to the point you can't separate them any longer.

It's pretty clear the first season is largely scripted.  The ""conflict"" seems to follow a pretty predictable path - and seems to come out of absolutely nowhere.  The three principals - Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Susie Feldman, wife of Corey Feldman - appear to go out of their way to antagonize one another.  ""Bad Boy"" Haim arrives on the scene, ostensibly for a reunion with his old teen star friend.  The friendship had gone awry, apparently mostly due to Haim's drug habit during his most successful years.  ""Good Guy"" Feldman apparently was reluctant to go through with the reunion; but once having agreed to it, tries desperately to make the best of it.  All the while, ""Skeptic"" Susie doubts very much if anything of any lasting value can come of the reunion.  There are flare-ups almost from the first; but they don't seem genuine.  Susie, for instance, is a Vegan; so what does Haim do?  You got it: he goes out of his way to bring as much meat as possible back into the Feldman household.  He further antagonizes Susie by making a pass at the Feldman's guest from PETA, who doesn't seem at all concerned; she simply advises Haim she has a boyfriend.  What makes this scene seem especially artificial is Susie's overwhelming desire to please the girl from PETA - as if  she's seeking some kind of sanction from PETA when, in reality, it would make more sense for PETA to be seeking some kind of testimonial or financial commitment from the Feldman's.

Then, as a kind of denouement to Season One, Corey Haim becomes so desperate for romance that, after rejecting as a potential girlfriend any woman who's an aspiring actress, he calls his girlfriend who's gone to England and begs her to come visit him at the Feldman's.  She agrees.  She stays one night in Haim's room then announces to him in the morning that she's returning to England.  Her reason?  She needs a commitment; and Haim appears unwilling to make one.  Soon after she leaves, the entire reunion breaks down into a free-for-all of bickering, name-calling and even threats of violence.  At that point, all three principals realize that the reunion just wasn't working out.  So Haim leaves.  Curtain.

The biggest problem quickly surfaced at the very beginning of Season One: Corey Haim's ego.  A Hollywood creation with an oversized ego - who would have thought it?  The more subtle problem, which really doesn't begin to surface until Season Two, is Corey Feldman's insensitivity toward his long-time friend and co-star.  The third problem is Susie Feldman's somewhat petty and vain attitude toward Corey Haim in particular and the Two Coreys' reunion in general.  Believe it or not, Corey Haim comes off as the most honest and the most likable of the three principals.

Season Two, in which a second attempt is made to effect a reunion, introduces three new characters.  One is Dr. Jeri, a counselor the two Coreys visit on a regular basis to try and work out their differences.  The other two are personal assistants hired by the Coreys.  Feldman's, who seems to serve more as a house servant, is a young man so charmingly hip that he almost steals the show; whereas Haim's is a very serious young woman who assists him in attempting to jump start his career.

This time around, Haim is not invited to stay with the Feldmans as a houseguest; rather, he secures an apartment, with the help of his assistant.  The apartment he takes he pronounces to be perfect for him.  It looks like a typical bachelor's apartment and has a magnificent view overlooking Los Angeles.  Almost immediately, as expected, the sparks begin to fly the moment the two Coreys meet up this second time.  The sessions with Dr Jeri are intense, fascinating to watch, and seem to be essentially unscripted.  Dr Jeri is a recovered addict herself, so she doesn't mince words whenever Haim appears to be on any kind of drugs.  The three main highlights of Season Two are Haim's taking out an ad in Variety to apologize en masse to all the people his antics have hurt over the years; in his discussions with his assistant he makes it clear that that's his only motive for the ad - although the moment the Feldman's hear about it, they read it as an underhanded attempt to get back into the business.  The second highlight is Susie's efforts to become a Playboy Magazine centerfold; with her husband's help she meets with Hugh Hefner then goes through a photography session.  The third highlight is Corey Feldman's decision to get a tummy tuck; he explains that all his life his mother had criticized him as being fat and ugly.

This probably all sounds like a disgusting display of self-centered vanity that ought to be avoided at all costs; or at best like some typical Hollywood expose.  But there's actually a good deal of genuine drama and emotion.  It's as if the producers, realizing how shallow and meaningless trying to fake a human relationship between real people comes off, decided at last to throw out the script and just let whatever happens happen.  Naturally, it's obvious that the Two Coreys are at all times aware of being on camera; but the unfolding conflict seems pretty much on the up and up.  As noted at the beginning of this review, though, ""The Two Coreys"" holds very little interest for anyone who has no concern with either or both of the Coreys.  Although the death of Corey Haim a year later adds a depth and a poignancy to it.  For any deceased Hollywood star, there's a final performance - their last work before they died.  Corey Haim's final appearance was as himself, which alone makes this show unique and even valuable.",1317945600,7,6250,4.722068328716528
