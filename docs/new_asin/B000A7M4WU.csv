This movie raises disturbing questions about the misuse of hypnosis which is itself a very mysterious subject.

Hypnosis seems to be able to tap into the mysterious powers of the subconscious mind.  Once someone gains access to that mysterious realm what sort of potential might they have for doing evil ?

That's the subject of this movie.

At the end of the movie one of the good guys warns the audience about allowing themselves to be hypnotized by people they may not know too well or who may have evil intentions.

Yes I think it is probably possible to do harm using hypnosis.

8075701,1,B000A7M4WU,"While this shocker ranks as one of the most offbeat low-budget horror films of the sixties and features the voluptuous Allison Hayes, the print of this DVD is horrendous. Barely watchable at best. Those unfamiliar with ""Hypnotic Eye"" will not appreciate it in this lousy print. Those who know this film and like it will be really offended. The film itself is in b&w and deals with a stage hypnotist (Jacques Bergerac, an ex of Ginger Rogers) who along with his beautiful assistant Justine (Hayes) hypnotizes beautiful women from the audience who later end up horribly disfiguring themselves in various mystifying ways. They later have no memory of being hypnotized or what happened to them. Fairly discomforting for the time, it still is bizarre and creepy. Bergerac is sleek and handsome as the hypnotist while Hayes' mask-like beauty conceals something far more sinister. Lots of stagy gimmicks involving hypnotism and unintentionally hilarious audience participatiion help make this fun to offset the grisly goings on involving female facial disfigurement. The make-up is appropriate for the types of ""accidents"" the victims have. ""The Hypnotic Eye"" is a matter-of-taste experience, even today, and could be appreciated again by those game for it, but Retro's print is abominable and should be avoided. I hope a better one comes along. I like the film myself.",1127779200,19,1362,5.195454545454545
