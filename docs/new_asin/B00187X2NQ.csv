8268741,5,B00187X2NQ,"This is one of my favorites. I had seen a few of the performances on other DVD's so I had a good feeling about this one when I ordered it. I'm a Gaither fan so I appreciate the historical sidebars including Jake Hess, Hovie Lister, The Happy Goodman family and others. The cameo appearance by Romance Watson was a special bonus. I would highly recommend this DVD to any Gaither fan as well as anyone with an interest in experiencing a wide range of southern gospel.",1375056000,,465,4.4186046511627906
8268742,5,B00187X2NQ,"Bill and Gloria Gaither meet their Homecoming Friends at the Georgia Dome for ""Atlanta Homecoming."" Many local artists join the regular friends adding vitality and freshness to an already packed program of Gospel Music - Southern style.

Highlights of the program include: Janet Pascal with The Lawrenceville Church of God Choir singing ""Something Got A-Hold on Me,""  ""What A Meeting in the Air"" featuring Terry Blackwood, Wesley Pritchard, and David Phelps, and the Gaither Vocal Band singing ""Alpha And Omega."" I also enjoyed the comedy routines of Bill Gaither, Mark Lowry, and Ken Davis.

A very moving number featured Anthony Burger's with a narrative regarding his five year old son playing Jesus in the children's church Easter production followed by Burger's powerful piano arrangement of ""We Shall Behold Him.""

A grand finale included an amazing arrangement of ""The Church Triumphant"" featuring Bill and Gloria Gaither and the Homecoming Friends."" A combination of entertainment and inspiration exalting the Name of Jesus - the central theme of all Gospel music.",1297036800,6,1072,5.363095238095238
