Bill Murray did a good job as a heartless gangster. When it can Megan Fox's character, they were both draw to her and this make a deceit move. It is definitely worthy of viewing but I satisfy that I bought it.",1465171200,,356,4.25
8438851,5,B004RA7YEY,"The Passion Play is a 1903 French Silent film that depicts the life and death of Jesus Christ. The film is using a method called Pathecolour to tint the film into colour. It is hard to imagine that this film is over 100 years old. The technique used is quite primitive. However, the message is easy to read. It is a well done film that touches both the mind and the soul. Highly recommended. 5/5.",1343433600,,396,4.293333333333333
