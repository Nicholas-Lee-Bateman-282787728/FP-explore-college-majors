Currently, I work in a nonbootcamp type of facility that buys totally into the nonstrict philosophy of behavioral modification. Even though the nonstrict, nice and gentle approach works for many clients, for many it does not. There are a portion of troubled youth in which the nice, gentle way is a waste of time. They see the kind therapeutic approach as weak and easily manipulated. For these kids, they just go in and out of different behavioral programs their whole childhood until they graduate to prison. This occurs because all kids are different and require different things in order to get their attention and motivate them towards change. For these kids, a non abusive military style bootcamp can be beneficial. This documentary protrays a honest view of how a bootcamp is suppose to be run like. For example, drill sargents do not hit the kids... they don't even put their hands on them - even though the media will state other wise. Even though there is a lot of yelling, especially at first, to get the kids attention, the documentary also explains that drill sargents take on many roles to the kids they work with - big brother, father figure, ect. In programs like these, as the documentary shows, it is not unusual for a drill sargent to have a heart to heart talk with a kid and provide a self esteem rising and motivational talk. These programs ARE NOT just about yelling and being hard on kids. I feel this documentary is a perfect example and a must watch for anyone who has a negative view of bootcamps for troubled youth. Personally our narrow-minded view of mental/ behavioral health treatment has not helped our kids. We have more disrespectful kids today than we have ever had. Also our prison population is getting bigger every year... not smaller. I think this is occuring because our so called behavioral/ mental experts have totally bought into the nonstrict/ nonfirm approach that does not reach all kids. I believe our mental health professionals are more interested in talking about things that sound good than if they really work or not. Basically.... watch this video even if you don't agree with bootcamps. Also don't watch this film looking for problems because personally, even though I agree with bootcamps, there were some scenes I didn't agree with even though they weren't abusive. I just felt the drill sargent could have handled it differently. Even though thats true, that doesnt mean the whole program is worthless. Heck there are things about the program I work at I don't agree with either and its considered the best in the state.

I say lets open our minds and support properly run programs such as this documentary displays. This is an excellent video and a must see for anyone who works in the behavioral field and also for parents of troubled children thinking about sending their kids to a military style bootcamp.

Five stars!!!!! (Dont listen to the media who picks out the poorly run bootcamps to scrutinize to form your opinion. Also, all programs have staff that may go over the line at times and not do what they are suppose to do - strictly therapeutic ones and bootcamps. To pick out a couple staff not doing their jobs right and then shut down all bootcamps is rediculous! There is value in these programs which this DVD shows. Are these programs for everyone? Of course not!! However for some.... it may be the only thing that will work.",1166486400,8,3527,4.7520391517128875
