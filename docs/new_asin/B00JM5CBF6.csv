6381509,4,B00JM5CBF6,"The Tag Team Title match between The Usos(Jimmy & Jey) against The Wyatt Family(Luke Harper & Erick Rowan) was a great match to start with. The Divas title match between Paige & Naomi was also well done. The Adam Rose-Damien Sandow match stinks like a bad chesseburger that's been sitting under a carseat for 2 weeks. The Money in the Bank match was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth fun fest despite lazily booked finish. The Goldust/Stardust-Ryback/Curtis Axel tag team match was so-so at best. The Rusev-Big E Langston match was awful this side of WCW. The Layla-Summer Rae match was nothing more then a dud. The WWE Championship ladder match was good but not as wild as the MITB ladder match from the start. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1404604800,,735,4.661538461538462

6381511,3,B00JM5CBF6,"1.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The Usos (c) vs Luke Harper and Erick Rowan

Decent Tag Team bout to start off the night. Harper and Rowan need to get more credit as a Tag Team because they can really throw down and impress in the ring. The Usos retain the titles after a double team Superfly Splash on Rowan. I feel like this match would've been better had it been a Ladder Match. Too bad that Rowan and Harper didn't win this match, as I feel this was their time to get the championships.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Diva's Championship Match: Naomi w/Cameron vs Paige (c)

I was a bit worried about who Paige would defend the championship against in the beginning at this PPV, as it all pointed to Cameron. But after Naomi pinned Paige on an episode of Main Event, we were fortunate to get treated to such a match on PPV. This match was short---as are all Diva matches these days, but this one tended to move back and forth for its duration. Paige counters a move and does a unique DDT on Naomi for the win. This was easily the best title defense Paige has had on PPV so far. There was a decent amount of build-up involved and more importantly, Paige's opponent was someone who could give her a run for her money in the ring

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Damien ""Paul Revere"" Sandow vs Adam Rose

Nothing but a filler match to take up time on the PPV. Damien Sandow continued his comedy gimmick by coming to the ring dressed as Paul Revere and cutting a heel promo on Boston. This wasn't like many Sandow squash matches you see on TV these days though. Sandow dominated for most of the match and almost seemed like he was about to win. Adam Rose makes a comeback at the end and hits his finisher on Sandow for the win. So sad to know that at last year's Money In The Bank, Sandow won the Smackdown Money In The Bank briefcase and at this year's Money In The Bank, he's losing in a filler match

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Seth Rollins vs RVD vs Jack Swagger vs Dolph Ziggler vs Kofi Kingston vs Dean Ambrose

This was easily the match of the night. Aside from Jack Swagger, this match was filled with exciting superstars who had charismatic/technical/ high-flying moves to mix up with the ladders. This was really an amazing match to watch as there were plenty of times in the match, where superstars who weren't even popular favorites to win almost looked like they were going to win. Lots of dangerous spots were on the menu in this match as well. Dean Ambrose comes within an inch of retrieving the briefcase, until Kane interferes and takes out Ambrose with a Chokeslam and a Tombstone. This gives Rollins enough time to re-enter the ring, climb the ladder and claim the briefcase. Wade Barrett was originally supposed to be in the match but was taken out of after getting injured by Jack Swagger at the Smackdown tapings. It was rather disappointing as Barrett was my top pick to win the match

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) RybAxel vs Stardust and Goldust

Basic Tag Team match that was just another filler. Stardust gets the win with a roll up pin on Ryback.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Rusev w/Lana vs Big E

A rematch from their Payback fight. Big E puts up a fight but in the end is forced to tap out to Rusev's camel clutch finisher again. A shame to see that WWE has reduced Big E to jobbing to a guy with a gimmick that is bound to run stale in the near future. This Russia vs USA feud would've been better off in the 1980s, when the Cold War tension between the US and Russia was at its highest; not in 2014.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) Summer Rae vs Layla -  (Special Referee: Fandango)

This match was better off happening on Raw or Smackdown. There was nothing so special about this feud that it deserved PPV time. I don't think many were too invested in the feud to begin with. I mean come on. Two girls fighting over a jobber who hasn't had a relevant match in the company since Wrestlemania 29? Layla gets the win with a kick to Summer's head. Following the match; Layla and Fandango share a kiss, while Summer lays in the ring crying, giving fans her Golden Raspberry performance for worst actress. WWE should've just stretched the PG rules and let these two go at it in a Catfight match or have a match in a swimming pool of milk, since they liked pouring it on each other so much and would've been a better means for a match than this.

8.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Ladder Match: Sheamus vs Bray Wyatt vs Alberto Del Rio vs Cesaro vs John Cena vs Randy Orton vs Roman Reigns vs Kane

This match wasn't as good as the earlier Money In The Bank Ladder Match. It did have its nice share of brutal spots though. Orton even bled from the top of his head for most of the match. Watching the match, I was almost a bit shocked that both belts didn't snap off the hold and drop to the mat, as that almost looked like what was going to happen on several occasions. WWE kind of teased people when Kane's pyro holders were on the turnbuckles during the match, giving many the impression that he was going to win. Of course it didn't happen though as John Cena overcame the odds and climbed the ladder to become a 15 time World Champion

Overall: I wasn't very impressed with this PPV. The Tag Team match, The Diva's Championship Match, and the Money In The Bank briefcase match were the best matches on the card. The World Title Ladder Match wasn't that bad either to be honest. The rest of the matches were just 4 fillers that had no use being on the PPV card. Those 4 matches could've been kept off the show to give other matches more time. It didn't help that the crowd was quiet and didn't sound very invested in the PPV.",1404086400,3,6264,4.960840496657116

MONEY IN THE BANK 2014

1.[TAG TITLES]THE USOS VS LUKE HARPER & ERICK ROWAN-this was an excellent opening match with two teams who have great chemistry. The Usos were flying all over the place here as the faster team but the Wyatts used their power to slow them down. The action here was back and forth with each team having great moments each such as the double superplex and such. The Usos retain here in a great match.

2.[DIVAS TITLE]PAIGE VS NAOMI-this was a great Divas match with Paige defending. There were many near falls and submissions here traded between both ladies. Still it was Naomi that really looked great here as she was very aggressive. Both women came to win and even after a nasty spill they still brought the action. In the end the champ retained in a very good match.

3. ADAM ROSE VS DAMIAN SANDOW-this was an entertaining match but a quick one that was meant to pass up a little time. Sandow who I believe is vastly underrated came out as Paul Revere and was funny. I am still not sure how I feel about Rose but he did well here and got the victory. Good match over all.

4.[MITB LADDER MATCH]RVD VS KOFI KINGSTON VS DOLPH ZIGGLER VS DEAN AMBROSE VS JACK SWAGGER VS SETH ROLLINS-this was an excellent MITB match and one of the most fun I have watched. The crowd was so into this one especially when Ambrose or Ziggler looked like they were going to win it. Also they were so into RVD about to come off of the ladder before he was shut down. Each man looked like they belonged in main events here as everyone put in a superstar effort. There were many high spots as these matches often have. I really enjoyed this match and thought the ending made a lot of sense with Rollins winning thanks to Kane.

5. RYBAXEL VS GOLDUST & STARDUST-good tag match right here as both teams trade momentum. The power went to Rybaxel but the Dust Brothers worked well as a team attaining the win. This was a well paced match and back and forth.

6. RUSEV VS BIG E-this match was just as good as their previous match at the last PPV. Good back and forth high impact action. That of course includes another spear to the outside by Big E. yet the ending remains the same as E has to tap out.

7. LAYLA VS SUMMER RAE-Fandango was the special referee for this match since he was involved in the love triangle. Now the story here was funny but the match was probably worst on the card. Both did well enough but it didn't live up to the rest of the card let alone the previous Divas match. Layla ends up winning this short match.

8.[WWE TITLE LADDER MATCH]JOHN CENA VS RANDY ORTON VS KANE VS BRAY WYATT VS SHEAMUS VS ALBERTO DEL RIO VS ROMAN REIGNS VS CESARO-like others have pointed out this was a different match compared to the earlier MITB match. Still this one had that main event feel and that atmosphere really added and helped the match. Like any match like this there are various high spots and creative use of the ladders, one moment in particular I really enjoyed with two men on a combination of three. Everyone looked great here and had moments of their own including near wins. Cena of course ends up the winner here and for the most part I didn't mind. It actually made sense with Lesnar ending up feuding with him.

6381520,2,B00JM5CBF6,"I wanted to review this when it was fresh in my mind and when I was freshly pissed off by the out come lol. But it wasn't available to review here for awhile. Anyway the only match that wasn't predictable was Summer Rae vs Layla and that's just sad.
  The Money in the Bank for the Vacated title was the hardest to watch if you're 110% tired of Cena like I am. At one point he literally just watched Cesaro and Sheamus battle on the ladder for the belt from outside the ring! The most he did was take everyone's finishers at different moments so he can stay outside the ring more than once. Then after no one was around he simply grabbed the belts to be called the greatest of all time by tool Michael Cole. Everyone else took all the bumps and I really think he won his first time actually climbing the ladder!
  No one is buying that Cena is the greatest unless they can't think for themselves. So now Hogan and Flair get paid to endorse Cena which is just sad. Since no way is he the greatest of all time or even close. He is killing WWE for me and many others and the constant ass kissing just makes it worse. As well as the fact that he makes it predictable and boring.
  And using him to advertise the WWE Network is just dumb since his unworthy ass being a 15 time world champ now and being called the greatest of all time turned off many to even wanting the Network anymore.",1405468800,,1382,4.157303370786517
6381521,3,B00JM5CBF6,"Tag Team Champions The Usos vs. Luke Harper & Erick Rowan - The Wyatts were singling out one member & working them over in their half of the ring using their power & brawling tactics at times focusing on the head & neck area while the Usos relied on their speed to keep them off balance with fast strikes & kicks as both teams traded momentum with various double teaming tactics & high risk maneuvers along with a series of near falls.  Great opening match.

Divas Champion Paige vs. Naomi - Both girls started off very aggressive with a lockup that started in the ring & continued out to the floor along with having the same idea for early offense before Naomi was able to take control with an impactful slam to the outside as both women traded momentum rolling through & reversing pins along with each attempting a submission throughout the match along with taking a real nasty fall off the top rope at one point.  This was definitely the hardest I've seen both divas work leading to a competitive match between the two with the side story being who Cameron was showing her support to throughout the match.

Adam Rose vs. Damien Sandow - Sandow dressed as Paul Revere (they were in Boston) beating Rose down & keeping him grounded with offense like a full nelson slam & ""The Elbow Is Coming!"" before Rose made a quick comeback for the victory.  This pretty much nothing more than a filler television match where the commentary was more entertaining than the match itself.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Jack Swagger vs. Seth Rollins - It should be noted that Bad News Barrett was injured earlier in the week eliminating him from this match as this match was full of various highlights including Ambrose staying true to his word targeting Rollins right away fighting into the timekeepers area, the unique way Kofi caught himself falling off the ladder, ladder used as a weapon, superstars sacrificing themselves to hurt the other, one man getting taken out due to injury only to return later, one man backdropped onto a scaffold ladder, a chair coming into play, signature moves executed using the ladder, and ""there's always a Plan B.""  This was one of those ladder matches that had tons of hard work & crazy spots where everyone has having their moment to shine with my opinion being Jack Swagger being the M.V.P. of the match getting without a doubt his strongest singles performance in almost a year.

Goldust & Stardust vs. RybAxel - Both of the Rhodes brothers were in control early as a team & individually before RybAxel was able to single out one member of the team grounding him using their power advantage as both teams traded momentum until it took one team's miscommunication opened the door for the other to capitalize.  A solid tag team match but not any different than we hadn't already seen from both teams.

Big E vs. Rusev - Both men came out with flags representing their country as Rusev used his power to his advantage with big offense & strikes while also trying to take away Big E's power by keeping him down only for Big E to showcase his strength as well with similar offense along with other impactful offense including a urange & spear in what was once again a physical match between the two similar to their previous encounter last month.

Special Guest Referee - Fandango: Summer Rae vs. Layla - Fandango definitely had one of the most unique referee shirts I've seen as I give Layla credit in attempting some wrestling like an indian deathlock submission but this resembled a catfight more than anything else to the point & heavily weak compared to the previous divas match where the the crowd started chanting ""boring"" but at least it was kept short.

WWE Championship Ladder Match: Roman Reigns vs. John Cena vs. Cesaro vs. Sheamus vs. Kane vs. Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Bray Wyatt - ""The Authority"" Triple H & Stephanie McMahon sat at ringside for this match while John Cena still got a heavy negative reaction in his own hometown as this match had such moments including unlikely allies working together, the ladder used in various ways from a weapon to making offense more impactful, each superstar having a moment of dominance including one moment with superstars showcasing a feat of strength never shown before that literally left two other superstars hanging for their life, one superstar heavily cut on the top of their head that required medical attention, everyone climbing up the ladder at one time & coming close to winning at one point, ""YOU CAN'T SEE ME FELLA!"", and the wild card in Kane showcasing what his true motives were throughout the match.  This was a different ladder match from earlier but just as crazy with the insane spots along with originality that we haven't seen in previous ladder matches with the only downfall being who won it depending on your point of view but I won't let that overshadow what was a really good main event.

This PPV was a step down from the series of events WWE has been on since WrestleMania as a majority of the card was filled with matches that weren't any different than their previous matches or either free television or the previous PPV along with some coming off as nothing more than a filler with the only standout matches being the Tag Team & Divas Championship matches along with the ladder matches so I would recommend this for a stream or replay on their network but for a DVD format, I recommend a rental at best.",1404950400,3,5497,4.653608247422681
