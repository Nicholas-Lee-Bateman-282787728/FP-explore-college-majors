8399830,5,B003LU4S2W,"In a world of uncertainty and fear, ""Twelve Ordinary Men"" is a story that will inspire and move you: it is the story of twelve men--touched by God in a way no one else had previously experienced. In their quest to spread the Gospel message, they would witness unimaginable miracles and endure unspeakable cruelty. Yet despite overwhelming forces aligned against them, they would change the course of history in a single lifetime.

""Twelve Ordinary Men"" features interviews with leading scholars, exciting recreations, and authentic footage in an investigation that dares to look beyond the peaceful image of saints in stained-glass windows to reveal the true and stirring stories of Jesus' closest followers.

The message of the Twelve Apostles is clear... Jesus entrusted these ordinary men with the most extraordinary and seemingly impossible mission. Against all odds, that mission was accomplished. If He can do this with twelve ordinary men, what can He do in the lives of His followers today?
