5847438,4,B00DQN6IOK,"I watched 'The Hollow Crown' in its entirety last summer, through less-than-legitimate channels, and I'm thrilled it's finally being released here in the US. All three plays ('Henry IV' is in two parts) were adapted by acclaimed producers, directors, and actors, and they were all shot at locations in which the events that informed Shakespeare's pen actually occurred -- unbelievably amazing, from an American fan's perspective. They are all beautifully filmed, artistically designed, and quite nice to look at. Although value judgements of works of art are personal and subjective, here's what I thought of this series:

I found 'Henry IV' horrendously awful, poorly adapted, superficial, badly-acted, and brainless enough to have come out of an over-funded community theater (I had been a fan of Jeremy Irons for years, and I didn't know he was capable of acting badly, but he certainly surprised me here), and 'Henry V' to be the most peculiarly abominable piece of film I've ever seen. Tom Hiddleston's lamentable performance in the lead role was the worst thing about a terrible production, and the whole of the movie came over as something you might expect from people who'd won some sort of contest and hadn't ever acted before except in car commercials or something (aside from John Hurt, who was stereotypically amazing, and M&eacute;lanie Thierry, whose Katherine was naturalistic and lovely). Hiddleston has been good in other roles, but bombed unmercifully in this one; every line reading fought with the text, and his physical presence came down exclusively to arm-waving and empty gesticulation. I have no idea what happened to him. On the other hand, I'm genuinely sorry 'The Hollow Crown' isn't making it to teevee, because that means Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear, and Rupert Goold won't be eligible for Emmys or Golden Globes for 'Richard II' (ETA: I've just seen that PBS is going to air the series this September, so maybe one or more of them will get a shiny gold object to commemorate his awesomeness). Whishaw's King Richard is a unique and magnificent edition to the formal canon of filmed Shakespeare, and everything about that third of the series was perfect. The film hinges on a stunning visual/narrative metaphor that first conflates and then confuses the English king and the Christian god, and then describes in painful detail the price of holy/royal martyrdom. It was truly one of the finest films I've ever watched. I felt as if I'd really seen both the poetry and the tragedy brought not just to life, but to death, and as a viewer I found the experience breathtaking. Whishaw's voice alone could win awards, and in fact his performance in 'The Hollow Crown' got him a BAFTA just this past spring. My advice is to buy the box but skip the back end of 'The Hollow Crown' and follow 'Richard II' with Branagh's 'Henry V,' which, though flawed, is at least a well-made representation of the play and the fictional version of the king.

Despite my inability to enjoy the Henries, I've pre-ordered the DVDs. I would recommend them highly for fans of filmed Shakespeare and also for fans of unutterably bad movie train-wrecks.
(I took off one star for Henries IV & V, but I don't want to downgrade 'Richard II' too far.)

Probably my review will get buried, because Hiddleston has an army of irrational, Twihard-style fangirls who won't hear a word against their hero -- but I have nothing whatever against the actor personally and I would be happy to watch him in other things. Just no more Shakespeare, please. Please.",1374796800,16,3545,4.934673366834171
5847439,5,B00DQN6IOK,"I was lucky enough to watch all four parts on YouTube a while back, before it
was pulled.  Just simply first-rate excellent.  But what is frustrating is that
it, apparently, is not being offered in Blu-ray.  Why not?  It was shot in, I
believe, 2011/2012 time period, has magnificent indoor/outdoor locations, yet
it isn't being offered in Blu-ray? Simply not right.  I believe that people in

5847440,5,B00DQN6IOK,"**********EDITED TO ADD:  Well, the man's immense popularity has had an effect; Mr. Hiddleston is now listed first on the cast list (at least as it displays on my pc.) ******************************

I'm fairly stunned that the product listing doesn't mention Tom Hiddleston, considering the importance of his role as first Prince Hal and then King Henry V in the Henriad (hint: that would be three of the four plays in this package.)  His performance was lauded by critics and awarded by public acclaim.  Not to mention the guy rules Tumblr. In other words: huge fan following.

For more context, his well-remarked other roles in recent years include significant appearances in productions such as BBC period piece Return to Cranford (with Dame Judi Dench), Spielberg's War Horse, Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, and..oh yes...as Loki in Marvel's Thor and The Avengers movies.

Presuming that this package contains the same material as that in the BBC product available in the UK, then I do highly recommend the set to both folks who appreciate Shakespeare and folks who appreciate the performers involved.  The production values are high, the acting top-notch, and of course the source material cannot be faulted.

Keep in mind that these are non-stage productions, Shakespeare as real life, and the directors had their own takes on how the plays should be framed. There is generally good consistency throughout the Henriad, even with two directors, but certain scene choices and dialogue deliveries may not be what you are used to seeing/hearing.  Still, a joy to own and watch in HD.",1372723200,127,1588,5.100386100386101

5847442,5,B00DQN6IOK,"BBC's ""The Hollow Crown"" is a 2012 adaptation of William Shakespeare's Henriad: Richard II, Henry IV parts 1 & 2, and Henry V. Each film is effectively a who's who of British actors in the early 2010s and a faithful adaptation of the play. Rupert Goold's adaptation of Richard II serves to set up the story of Henry Bolingbroke. Goold makes some interesting directorial decisions that visually and tonally set his film apart from the other three, but it's entertaining in its own way. Richard Eyre's Henry IV is fantastic, especially with Tom Hiddleston as Prince Hal (later Henry V) who steals the show. Part 2 of Henry IV is a bit weak, but the two support each other as a whole. Finally, Thea Sharrock does an amazing job making Henry V her own. This collection is a must-see for any Shakespeare fans!",1515024000,,804,4.629370629370629

5847485,4,B00DQN6IOK,"""Richard II"" was my favorite, but each film was terrific. The acting was superb, and I was fan girling Shakespeare throughout; after 500 years, his language remains above reproach. The producers cut several lines, or each play would have been too long for a BBC film, but they haven't abridged the plays to their detriment.

The leads (Ben Wishaw, Jeremy Irons, and Tom Hiddleston) embraced their roles with aplomb, especially Wishaw (as Richard), who manages to make you feel abject contempt one moment and utter compassion the next.

A couple of the casting choices were a bit odd and even distracting; for example, they cast a black actor in a pivotal role as duke clearly for the sake of political correctness, yet that person historically could never have been black. He played the role exceedingly well, but I couldn't help thinking about how he didn't look the part.

Believe it or not, the biggest flaw is the score. If you're going to invest in some of the world's best actors and use fabulous locations, set a bit aside for the music, which in this case is mediocre; at times it even interfered with my enjoyment of the films by swelling just as an actor delivered a crucial line.",1482883200,2,1190,4.711538461538462

5847490,5,B00DQN6IOK,"THIS REVIEW CONCERNS TE TWO SEASONS

The first ""volume covers Richard II, Henry IV, Part I and Part II, and Henry V. The second volume covers Henry VI, Part I and Part II and Richard III. These plays by Shakespeare have been adapted, the most concerned being Henry VI reduced from three parts to two.

I will not enter the historic content since I have already covered that with the BBC collection of the Complete Shakespeare, play after play. What is important is to see what this new production  and adaptation  brings us, and I must say it brings a lot.

First the language is still Shakespeares but the pronunciation has been modernized so that we can follow the text a lot better. By modernized I mean some archaic pronunciations have been dropped and the rhythmic pattern does not dictate the tempo and balance of the language. Instead of the traditional at times forced iambic diction this new production uses a more fluent and common linguistic flow that is closer to what we know and hear everyday. Of course when the poetic or archaic syntax is respected that produces strange sentences but since it flows more naturally we can deal with that. For those who are not conversant in Shakespearean English, post middle and pre modern English, the subtitles are there to help even if at times they are too abundant when the speech is particularly fast. But I am sure that a second watching would make that English perfectly clear, and for those who have some practice they should be up to it in about fifteen minutes at the most. Then I would suggest you use that language in everyday life for fun or entertainment.

The second improvement is the fact the whole series is shot in real settings, both natural and built. Hence we are really feeling  with our eyes  the coarse and rough stone castles, including the Tower of London. The insides are not always authentic since some palaces like Westminster Palace is no longer what it used to be, especially because of Big Ben. Same remark about Westminster Abbey which is nowadays overloaded inside with artifacts and all kinds of accumulated tombs, plates and other memorials. But the inside scenes are shot in real settings even if they are not authentic. I guess you see the difference. We definitely left plywood fake ramparts and battlements behind. That makes the series believable. We do not have to suspend our disbelief as for the setting itself.

The third improvement is that the actors are modern actors who are used to work for cinema productions. They are very flexible, expressive and emotional. Some may regret they don't cry that much but crying is not necessarily the best way to express grief. Facial language and body language are pretty nice too along that line and probably more realistic. We do not cry that much in real life. They are also dressed with costumes that must be lighter and that are definitely easier to wear. That also helps the production and makes it light, effective and even impressive.

The last improvement is that it is a cinema production done for High Definition TV and whats more color. So the series can use the full palette of colors when necessary though in the popular scenes with Falstaff, for example, and battles the dominant colors are brown and grey, sometimes black. But they can easily use red for spilling blood for instance and the red rose can really be red instead of dark grey or black. This production can also work on small details since modern flat TV plasma screen can include small details due to the size and the definition of the screen. That really improves the pleasure you way get with the very active scenes and with pageants or inside scenes that provides a lot of detail.

But at the same time this production is an adaptation and special effects permit to have a real burning stake for Joan of Arc and enable the action to be realistic and fast. You will not always notice the scenes that are cut in the original, though you should see the battle of Orleans has been entirely cut off at the beginning of Henry VI Part One. But most of the time you will not really see the difference except if you know the original plays very well. I am just going to give one example at the end of Richard III, the famous ghost scene or nightmare that is in the original doubled with the positive dreams of the future Henry VII. This scene is essential because it testifies of Shakespeares great art that invest some symbolical forms in his plays. The last battle is in 1485 at Bosworth. The numerical symbols are 1+8 = 9, 4+5 = 9, 1+4+8+5 = 18 = 9x2. The numerical symbol or key of Richard III is NINE, the devilish number of them all: Jesus time of death, the ninth hour, the Beast in the Apocalypse, and many other diabolical and deadly values.

In the nightmare NINE is necessary to complete the prophecy, the prediction, by identifying the beast, in this case Richard the Third before the battle. And sure enough the ghosts are going to curse Richard III with a simple formula: despair and die. And in that ghost scene this mantra is repeated NINE times. You can note too the characters who are haunting Richard III and alternately lauding Henry of Richmond.

1- Prince Edward, son to Henry the Sixth: despair, therefore, and die;
2 & 3- King Henry the Sixth: despair and die despair and die;
4- Clarence: despair and die;
5 & 6- Rivers, Grey and Vaughan: despair and die despair and die;
7- Hastings: despair and die;
8- the two young princes, sons of Edward IV: despair and die;
9- Queen Anne: despair and die;
- Buckingham: .

In this adaptation the number of ghosts is reduced and the number of repetitions of the mantra is also reduced though the presence of Henry VIs wife Margaret (who is not a ghost) holding a mirror in which Richard III sees the ghosts is a brilliant idea, though of course it prevents the parallel lauding apparitions to Henry of Richmond who has nothing to do with Margaret. I guess the research teams did not read my study of Richard III published at the end of the 1990s in France but in English where I pushed that element a lot farther than what I just said. We must understand that in Elizabethan times, after the Reformation and in the ascending phase of chapels and Puritanism, such biblical references were unavoidable elements that everyone understood and appreciated. Whats more it is very effective in the propaganda (rather self-justification) of the Tudors: the killing of the crucifixion with 4 (in this case of the evil character, hence an anti-Passion) is prophesied; the Second Coming is announced with 8 (this time Henry of Richmond, the savior of England); and the Beast is identified with 9 (Richard III), all contained in the date of the battle itself. And 5 is no better as for the diabolical value it carries. We are in the midst of medieval numerical symbolism directly inherited from Romanesque culture and alchemy.

This final battle is Bosworth which is supposedly in Old English a proper name Bosa + worth. I am not entirely satisfied by this meaning and I recognize in /bos-/ the root of Anglo-Saxon bosm, Middle English bosom, an old Germanic root:

bosom (n.)  Old English bosm ""breast; womb; surface; ship's hold,"" from West Germanic *bosm- (source also of Old Frisian bosm, Old Saxon bosom, Middle Dutchboesem, Dutch boezem, Old High German buosam, German Busen ""bosom, breast""), perhaps from PIE root *bhou- ""to grow, swell,"" or *bhaghus ""arm"" (in which case the primary notion would be ""enclosure formed by the breast and the arms""). Narrowed meaning ""a woman's breasts"" is from 1959; but bosomy""big-breasted"" is from 1928. Bosom-friend is attested 1580s; bosom buddy from 1920s. (http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bosom, accessed December 6, 2016)

The name Bosworth must have been meaningful for Shakespeare, especially with bosom-friend appearing in his period. We then can understand this battle is worth a lot to the heart of anyone who believes the Tudors have brought peace and prosperity to England, since the heart is directly in the breast, the bosom on which my bosom friend can rest his head in my hugging arms, note the space between my hugging arms and my breast or chest is the bosom.

Of course this is elaborate and subtle. It was probably well understood by the greater part of the audience of the Globe Theater but it is lost today, and thats probably why this production has modified the end of the play Richard III, but I regret it because it turns the Shakespearean magic into some plain action film, even if it is a good one.

All the actors are superb, and the productions are very cinematic without losing any of the nuance or humanity that make the plays so glorious. As well as being the definitive Shakespearean film adaptations of these plays since Olivier's or Branagh's Henry V (in my opinion), we also get to see the full story arc,as I was not as familiar with Richard II or Henry IV Pts. 1 and 2,so it also can appeal to those who enjoy English history,as long as one acknowledges it is being told through a dramatic Shakespearean filter. If you enjoy Game of Thrones,or Rome, you will enjoy this,although the language is a little daunting for the uninitiated.

First, the series is AMAZING. Jeremy Irons is superb as well as Ben Whishaw. But Hiddleston as prince Hal and later as Henry V (remember this review while watching the big speech ""band of brothers"") just brought me to tears.

5847501,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Shakespeare's rather rarely performed history plays about late medieval English history.

The first series is about three kings, the first of which is a looney-tune who can't do anything right, which is a bad thing in a king, so he very quickly ends up very dead.  The second king is more OK, but he can't get anything important done because people keep trying to take him out, while his son wastes all his time boozing it up in this dive saloon with this bunch of Animal House type guys, one of whom, Fat Jack, is a real riot. The third king is this same son who decides that now that he is king he should get serious so he decides to conquer France, apparently not understanding that even if he conquers it, it will just get conquered back again.

The second series is basically about this long gang war between two families, the North White Flowers and the West Blood Roses. Things get complicated because, on the one hand, the Flowers' capo is a heavy dude, while the Roses' boss is mental, but on the other hand, the Roses' boss's moll, French Maggie, is heavier than any dude around.  In the end the last man standing is a Flower, Crooked Dick, but he don't stand for long.

The scene where Richard II is handing over his crown to Henry IV was riveting. It was by far the best part of the movie. Richard II sets up the following stories perfectly. The real star of the series is Tom Hiddleston. I'd only seen him as Loki in the Thor/Avengers movies; then in season 2 of Cranford (by Elizabeth Gaskell), so I knew a bit of his acting. What I knew of him I liked, but after watching him play Prince Hal turned King Henry V, I love him. He is a brilliant actor. He displays a full range of emotion. He's very dynamic to watch and really funny too! Jeremy Irons is wonderful as well. He's so great as a father who doesn't know what to do with his son. He makes the king so much more than just a king. He is a father, and you feel for him. I also have to tip my hat to Simon Russel Beale who plays Falstaff. Wow. Enough said.

There are several extremely memorable scenes between these four DVDs. I recommend watching the DVD extras about making the movies and the interviews with the actors and directors. It was really interesting hearing them all comment on the process, their thoughts on Shakespeare, casting, etc. I think this production could make a Shakespeare fan out of just about anyone.

5847564,4,B00DQN6IOK,"The Hollow Crown is a great way to watch the Henriad in a manner that has a sense of consistency, produced as it is by the same team.  This helps a bit with the fact that stylistically  and structurally the plays vary a good bit.  ""Richard II"" is almost all dialogue, light on action or strong passions, and it is all Ben Whishaw's. though the other players give strong performances. Rory Kinnear as Bolingbroke/Henry IV does an excellent job of portraying the journey from aggrieved subject to ambivalent but ambitious usurper.  I thought the setting for Richard's imprisonment was a little strange, being such a clich&eacute;d ""dungeon"" set, but that's a minor quibble. Overall a good production of one of Shakespeare's more poetic plays.

""Henry IV Parts 1 & 2""  are the prime jewels in this crown, and make the entire purchase worthwhile by themselves. Simon Russell Beale deserves every bit of praise he's received for his Falstaff --vain, cunning, obsequious & blustering --- and Tom Hiddleston and Jeremy Irons match him  as Prince Hal & King Henry. The scenes with Falstaff & Hal are a wonder to behold, especially the mock trial where Hal defends himself against his father's  anger with Falstaff & Hal switching the roles of father & son. (Hiddleston's dead-on impression of Irons had us rolling). I found Armstrong's portrayal of Hotspur a bit too thuggish --- this could be colored by my reading on the historical Harry Percy --  but it works within the context of the play.  The progression of the dynamic between Hal & Falstaff is clear & well done in concert with Hal's dawning maturity.  Strong performances by all supporting players make these two an enormous pleasure.

""Henry V"" was somewhat of a disappointment, both in structure & production.  Hiddleston's portrayal of Henry suffers a bit in comparison to Kenneth Branaugh's, more ruthless than regal.  I understand removing Scene II, Act II ( the treason of the 3 lords) for streamlining, but reducing Henry's closing speech in that scene to one muttered line on board ship for France robs it of its' power & conviction. The siege of Harfleur lacks dynamic energy, especially the dramatic threat delivered to the city elders. & the first glimpse of the army (?) is disappointing ---- to say they employed a cast of dozens is generous. That lack is painfully obvious through the rest of the production, and becomes almost comical in the scene of the slaughter of the French prisoners.  The Crispin's Day speech is underwhelming, as it is mostly given face-to-face among the barons, rather than a rousing pronouncement to the army as a whole. This is a valiant effort with some interesting choices in execution, but as I said, it doesn't come up to Branaugh's in grandeur. This lack is what prevented me from giving the set 5 stars, but the ""Henry IV"" duo make up for the weakness of ""Henry V"", & more than justify the purchase.",1437868800,5,2899,4.828282828282828
5847565,5,B00DQN6IOK,"I have 30 or so discs of various Shakespeare plays. I consider this set among the very best. Yes, they've taken some liberties with the basic text, but nothing serious. What I appreciate is that they didn't just put a stage play onto film but instead used all the benefits of film (camera work, lighting, visual transitions, appropriate but nonintrusive background music, etc.) to make the play come to life and still remain true Shakespeare. Friends who likewise love Shakespeare have said the same things. One friend commented, if Shakespeare were alive today and had the chance to transfer his plays to film, this is very close to what he would likely produce. The discs also have excellent English subtitles that can be turned on to help viewers catch some of the words and phrases that might not be instantly familiar.",1437436800,2,823,4.843971631205674

5847603,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Having recently read the Henriadfour plays by William Shakespeare about three English kings (Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V)I was intrigued to learn a new film had been made for the BBC.  I purchase the DVD and was not disappointed.  This is story-telling on a grand scale, pulsing with life, shot on location, with a mix of young upcoming actors (Ben Whishaw in an award winning role as Richard II, Tom Hiddleston as Henry V) and seasoned pros (Jeremy Irons as Henry IV).  In my opinion, comparisons with past productions and past actors is pointless.  Every production is of its time, with actors of its time, and this one is of ours.  Were cuts made?  Of course. If you want the Henriad in its entirety, read the plays.

Other cast notables include: David Suchet as the Duke of York, Patrick Stewart as John of Gaunt, Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff, and Julie Waters as Mistress Quickly.  Final note: A production of the Wars of the Roses (Henry VI Parts 1 - 3, and Richard III) is in the works with release scheduled for 2016.  Stars include Dame Judi Dench, Benedict Cumberbatch as Richard III, Sophie Okonedo, and Michael Gamdon.

About these performances: Ben Whishaw is spellbinding as King Richard II.  As Shakespeare imagined him, Whishaws Richard is mysterious, enigmatic, a smoldering fire.  His interaction with Rory Kinnear as Bolingbroke--in the scene where the English Crown is at stake--is erie, surreal, foreboding.  Without doubt, the production of Richard II is the jewel of this series.

In Henry IV Parts 1 & 2, Jeremy Irons stands out as the king, world-weary and overtaxed as Enlands head of state.  Tom Hiddelston as Prince Hal might lack the swagger we expect from such a role, but he manages Hals evolution quite well, from Eastcheap rogue to battlefied hero to a king in waiting. Theres John Falstaff, the larger-than-life Fat Knight, played with panache by Simon Russell Beale.  Beale captures the sadness behind the bravado exactly right.  In the end, we see the bravado come not as easily as before and know, having been rejected by Hal (now Henry V), Sir John is dying of a broken heart.

Finally, Henry V.  Who wouldnt want to play Henry V?  All those inspiring speeches, defying the odds on the battlefield, winning the day and getting the girl.  While he seems too nice, Tom Hiddleston makes for a serviceable Henry V.  Perhaps weve seen enough Henrys that strut and command all the attention. Hiddleston offers a refreshing alternative.  With deceiving ease, he transforms from roguish Prince Hal, to King Henry V, to military commander on the Agincourt battlefield, and back to rogue in his pursuit of princess Katherine of France.  His is a winning if lightweight take on Englands heroic king.",1425340800,,2734,4.842672413793103

5847621,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Oh my gosh. If you haven't seen this highly acclaimed PBS (BBC) series, then you're truly missing out on something great. The cast itself (including Ben Whishaw of Bright Star and the recent Bond reboots, Jeremy Irons, and Tom Hiddleston) makes this one of the great productions of the Henriad (the plays Shakespeare wrote about the beginnings of the War of the Roses, in which Richard II, last of the Plantagenet line, loses his crown to Henry Bolingbroke, who later becomes England's Henry IV). It's an explosive drama of power, ambition, and familial struggles. Even if you know nothing about Shakespeare or his language, this will fit right in with those great medieval dramas that have become so popular lately: the Tudors, the White Queen, Reign, etc. If you need help with the language, there are some great books or notes, many for free on your Kindle or on the internet. One of the advantages of watching such old plays is that there have been tons written about it and there are many text notes to help explain certain passages. It might help to familiarize yourself with the plot first, but if you get caught up in the story, you'll enjoy it whether you get everything they say or not.

5847629,3,B00DQN6IOK,"Richard II is magnificent. The other plays are just OK. Ben Whishaw is perfect as Richard II, I think the most beautiful of Shakespeare's histories. The production is very fine. Jeremy Irons disappoints as the older Henry IV. He's not bad, he's just not great, although he is undeniably a great actor. The production in the other plays is nowhere near as captivating as in Richard. Even the crown is a dull brass, instead of the beautiful bejeweled gold of the first play. Perhaps that was an editorial comment on these far less poetic plays, or a reflection of Bolingbroke's doubtful claim to the throne. Tom Hiddleston is a fine Henry V. He looks every bit the young hero, and he makes the transition from rake to ruler very credibly. For me, Simon Russell Beale's Falstaff has more ""Lord of the Rings"" to it than Shakespeare. At least he looks like he crawled up from under a mountain. The dialog in Richard II is nicely paced and the acting is more natural, as opposed to the good old shouting/speedy/spitting style (didn't we leave that behind a generation ago?) in many scenes of the other plays. Are the gay allusions in Richard II a little too obvious? Perhaps a bit, but, these days, I'd expect anything but a subtle approach, and was glad to see it wasn't pushed too far.",1421366400,5,1281,4.598253275109171

5847655,5,B00DQN6IOK,"While I have nothing against Shakespeare, I also have not watched a great deal of it in the past.  Like many people, I suppose, it's the language that gets me- and that other than the two plays I'd seen David Tennant star in, the productions always seemed rather stodgy and overly dark and ornate.

Not so this version! I have a small list of actors whose performances I enjoy enough that I'll watch anything they are in.  I've found that even if the directing is bad, their acting is good enough to entertain me and I've always enjoyed their films.  Tom Hiddleston is one of them, so I decided-what the heck.  I'll buy it and watch the entire thing. (Not sure why it doesn't show I've purchased this, probably too long ago.  However I bought both the Region 2 disk set and Region 1.)

I'm really glad I chose to watch this.  First, the BBC chose to film all these plays that Shakespeare wrote so that they are, essentially, new episodes of a ""series"" since they deal with Kings who reigned in direct succession, and some even contain characters from the other plays.  Having these filmed as a series with the same production values and-in some cases- the same actors portraying the same parts from one play to the next- it fits together more than I've ever seen before.  Additionally, the ""production values"" I spoke of made this much more real and exciting than I've ever seen Shakespeare's plays filmed before.  The battle scenes are filmed in sweeping vistas of gorgeous countryside and the cinematography is gorgeous.  The costumes, sets and makeup are all first rate as well-- when you're watching a scene in a castle- it's a castle.  The blood in battle scenes is extremely realistic.  Everyone and everything about these films are made to be as realistic and relevant to ""now"" as possible.  And of course, being the BBC, they chose to hire only the very best British actors available- so the acting is first rate.

I found, for the first time, that I was enjoying the films so much that I *had* to know exactly what they were saying... and found a fantastic website called ""No Fear Shakespeare"" that has all the plays side by side with a translation into what words we use today.  It definitely became more fun viewing when I knew what the insults meant! :)  (The site is located here: http://nfs.sparknotes.com/ )

I definitely would recommend this series to fans of the actors involved,  and also fans of great sweeping drama with fantastic acting and cinematography.",1417651200,,2477,4.676674364896074

The casting is spot on, and it was a joy to watch one actor (Tom Hiddleston) progress through the arc of such an iconic character - Hal/Henry V.  I have heard grumblings about the St Chrispin's Day speech being delivered to only a handful of nobles, but frankly, the text informs the director's decision.  It is also a nice counterpoint to the ""once more unto the breach"" that is delivered to the common men.

Jeremy Iron is all spitting rage as Henry IV, and his upbraiding of Hal is a beautiful moment of a frustrated father.

The one miscast (to me) was the actor who portrayed the Dauphin.  Whenever he raised his voice, his Scottish showed.

Otherwise, a pleasure to watch - more than once.",1411689600,,833,4.543624161073826

5847699,5,B00DQN6IOK,"As with many people who have reviewed thus far, I came to know this series through PBS's gracious presentation across four weeks. And, also like many who have reviewed this series thus far, I will claim 'Richard II' the best of the four in the series.

At one point I held Branagh's version of 'Hamlet' up as the pinnacle of Shakespearean production in film. It was a massive achievement full of grand spectacle and pristine acting. However, while those opinions hold true, my opinion of greatest Shakespeare production was shaken when I beheld the immaculate 'Richard II.'

Ben Whishaw has become, in my eyes, the greatest Shakespearean actor of contemporary film. His delicate, powerful portrayal of a royal anomoly is nothing short of perfectly attentive. Should we hate a man who could not stand up as King, all-powerful as he once believed, and secure his crown and title and who so callously stripped the lands and possessions that rightfully belonged to another? Or should we feel sorry for a flawed monarch who was simply imbued with the wrong passions and spirit in the wrong station? Whishaw presents Richard II in such a light as to be examined from multiple points of view. The production is simply perfect.

The remaining plays of the Henriad are likewise fantastic. However, as a noticeable shift from the first production, 'Henry IV' through 'Henry V' force 'Richard II' to stand alone as a superier introduction. This is not to say tbat they are bad by any means. In the contrary, they hold themselves as wonderful adaptations of their own. 'Richard II' simply has the extra flair to give it a reigning command over the rest.

The set as a whole is unbeatable. They belong on the shelves of any Shakespeare enthusiasts. And if not made clear already, the purchase would be well worth it for 'Richard II' alone. So purchase this set and rejoice in a marvelously produced series that finally deserves the hype that everone has bestown upon it.",1410652800,,1957,4.832835820895522

5847717,5,B00DQN6IOK,"A wonderful collection, going in Henry V was my favourite Shakespeare play, but after the wonderful production on Richard II I think that may have changed. The language in that lay flows so fluently and perfectly, with several great moments/speeches, particularly Richard's ""Hollow Crown"" speech and any of the scenes between Richard and Bollingbrook. Wishaw and Kinear play them fabulously.

Henry IV parts 1 and 2 were a tad boring, and I feel Shakespeare himself probably could have just made them into one play, par 2 in particular seems very padded, although it is almost all worth it to see HIddleston's magnificence in delivering the damnation of Falstaff.

Henry V was fantastic as i anticipated and hoped for. I was slightly disappointed they cut out the ""Traitor Discovery"" scene, but other than that there was no let downs. The famous speeches were great, delivered masterfully and inspiringly by Hiddleston, the direction in the battle and the look of the battle was just right, and the interaction between Henry and Kat made me giggle.",1407888000,,1048,5.0520231213872835

5847723,4,B00DQN6IOK,"I came across this DVD set as I was preparing for a lecture at the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, DC.  The theater was showing the Henry IV plays, and wanted to refresh my memory before the lecture.  I'm very glad I stumbled across this set.

I had seen stage performances of each of these plays, but I was never impressed with any production of the Henry IV plays.  Even with Sir John Falstaff as a prominent character, the performances left me uninspired. Fortunately, these films changed my attitude completely.  The Henry IV plays have several scenes with characters hiding or in close quarters, and this type of intimacy adapts very well to film.  The director handled these scenes excellently.

There are four films in all, with one for Richard II, two for Henry IV, and one for Henry V.  There is a different director for each king.  Some characters appear in more than one play.  There is a change in actors as Henry Bolingbroke in Richard II becomes Henry IV in his own plays.  Jeremy Irons plays the aging Henry IV very well.  Fortunately, the character of Hal as he becomes Henry V is played throughout by Tom Hiddleston.

The only disappointing part of the set for me was Henry V.  I didn't care for it very much.  It lacked energy, and I was disappointed.  Interpretations of Henry V will inevitably be compared with the versions produced by Olivier and Branagh.  Anyone who knows the Olivier version will know that it was produced as a World War II propaganda film for the Brits, and the references to slaughter, pillaging, and rape were removed.  The result is a very dated view of Henry as a pure and virtuous king, which is very far from Shakespeare's Henry.  The Branagh version was much grittier and full of action.  The Branagh version also kept more of the playtext than did the Olivier version.  To me, the Hollow Crown version is better than the Olivier version, but it's below the Branagh version.  The results in The Hollow Crown's Henry V probably have more to do with directorial choices than with the actor.  Hiddleston was marvelous in the Henry IV plays, especially in the scene where he accuses the crown itself of murdering his father.  I'd like to see him try Henry V again in another production.

Ben Whishaw is intriguing as Richard II.  He gives a multilayered performance, showing Richard at various times as regal, proud, paranoid, vain, affectionate, delicate, desperate, and destitute.  It was a very affecting performance.  I hadn't seen very much work from Whishaw before, but I'll have to look for more of his stuff.

In all, the set is well worth your time and money.",1406851200,2,2615,4.6982378854625555

5847733,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Wow, I loved The Hollow Crown. I don't normally think of Shakespeare's history plays as being among his best work, but watching these adaptations changed my mind. This is classic stuff, beautifully filmed, with a great cast.

I had forgotten how cohesive these plays are; each one is strong in its own right, but watching them in a row makes them all better. Probably the most interesting part is seeing Prince Hal evolve from being a drunken barfly in Henry IV, Part I to a commanding warrior-king in Henry V. His character arc is great, and his relationship with Falstaff is one of the most complex and bizarre in all of literature.

As for the actual productions...they're very impressive. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all first-rate. To be honest, the style is a bit reminiscent of Game of Thrones, but in a good way. So, it you want to hook the younger generation on Shakespeare, this might be the best vehicle for it; just tell them: ""It's Game of Thrones, starring Loki from The Avengers.""

Speaking of Loki, Tom Hiddleston does a great job here - though to be honest, I preferred seeing him play the rascally Prince Hal over the more staid Henry V. Jeremy Irons and Patrick Stewart also give commanding performances, and Ben Whishaw's weird, almost ethereal take on Richard II is very effective.

I have one minor complaint, though. Because the series had three different directors, it doesn't feel *quite* as unified or cohesive as it should. Henry V, in particular, somehow feels different from (and a bit flatter than) the other productions, though maybe I'm judging it too harshly in comparison to the better Kenneth Branagh version.

Quibbles aside, this is great stuff. And as a bonus, the DVDs are pretty nice; they have good prints, and include short but informative making-of features. If you're a Shakespeare fan, I'd call this a must-buy. And even if you don't know Shakespeare well, but you like all those violent cable shows like Game of Thrones, the Borgias and the Tudors...try checking this out. Shakespeare was the original master at making history cool.",1405728000,,2092,4.865168539325842

They really lost me when a black actor was given the role of the Duke of York, King Henry's uncle, who most assuredly wasn't a black man.  What was the point of doing that? Were we supposed to pretend the guy was of the royal family, uncle of the king. Not possible, but now half of the UK will think the second Duke of York was from Africa.

They over did the grubbiness in a misguided effort to be realistic.  The Royals and nobles looked pretty much like the rest of the rabble in these films, and the royal quarters were bleak and dark. Give me a break.",1401840000,12,637,4.204918032786885

5847755,3,B00DQN6IOK,"There are many great things to recommend in this series. First, most of the main actors are quite good and they are giving it their all. However, there are too many choices made by the directors that just undercut the drama at every turn. Why do we need monologues in voiceover? Wasn't that bad enough when Oliver did it with Hamlet? How come Prince Hal needs to give the Saint Cripian day speech as if he's annoying people at a board meeting? Why does the DRAMA music have to come up in every important scene, practically announcing that the director doesn't trust the actors to deliver the goods?

There are also unprepared actors in the important roles. Does Hotspur have to walk around in leather pants like a high school actor that doesn't quite know what to do with his hands?

There are good bits. Falstaff is a great part for any actor, but there are too many problems to fully recommend it.",1398124800,11,899,4.50920245398773

I am not going to compare this rendition with previous attempts. Laurence Olivier s' Henry V is iconic; Orson Welles Chimes at Midnight is essential. Yes, they will always endure and perhaps never be equaled. But something was always missing, or not quite complete. But having the same director (Thea Sharrock) and superb actors re-apprising their roles (Tom Hiddleston as Hal and John Hurt as Henry IV) we get to see the characters grow, nay I say evolve. Hiddelston brings real integrity to the role of Prince Hal. He is a true master of his class. Some amazing and inspired choices were made in the rendering of Falstaff, played outstandingly by Simon Russel Beale. This is great entertainment. Don't miss out.",1397779200,,859,4.931034482758621

5847779,5,B00DQN6IOK,"I've been a Shakespeare nerd since middle school, and have read his works voraciously for years. The plays in this miniseries are some of his best work, and are brought beautifully to life in this collection. The performances are captivating, the camera work, costumes, and sets are gorgeous. The cast itself is enough to make it worth watching: Jeremy Irons, Patrick Stewart, John Hurt, Julie Walters, to name a few. Shakespeare's plays are great to read, of course, but they are truly meant to be watched and seen, and with the masterful hands of those involved with this production, you're seeing Shakespeare's work at its best.

I loved the vainglorious, slightly unhinged Richard II, here by Ben Whishaw. I've never seen Whishaw in anything before this, and he does an excellent job. He gives what is arguably the best performance of the series. Viewers see the king's schemes following John the Gaunt's death and the machinations with Bolingbroke's exile both for what they are and what Richard thought they would be.

Jeremy Irons gives the performance you expect from such a legendary actor as Henry IV, whether you see him as overwrought, ailing king or frustrated father. His ascension to the throne is still contested these many years later, and he has personal problems stemming from his own son, Hal, to deal with as well. Irons is the perfect actor for this role, as he is able to translate every nuance of his character. Irons is a stage and film veteran and it shows. He's magical in this role, tossing off difficult dialogue as if he speaks it daily. No movement, no expression, no small gesture, is wasted.

Tom Hiddleston is equally brilliant as Hal, the wayward prince of England taking advantage of his station in scandalous and even illegal ways and then eventually turning himself into a dedicated and battle-tested leader of his people. Hiddleston is delightful as this naughty royal, fun and funny as he both revels in his status and sloughs it completely, drinking heavily and mocking his father for the entertainment of tavern patrons. He pulls pranks and makes jokes, and eschews his responsibilities, but makes it clear in quiet moments that he will soon leave his way of life behind and prove himself worthy of the crown. He then fights for his father at Shrewsbury against his cousin, Henry 'Hotspur' Percy, whom Hal kills. Hiddleston truly shines once his Henry takes over the throne, becoming the king he was always meant to be. He proves himself to his father just before the older man's death and takes the crown, turning his back on the lowlifes and has them imprisoned for their crimes. Hiddleston delivers an impassioned ""Once more unto the breach..."" speech at the battle of Harfleur and we see for the first time a king rather than a boy. Under the guise of being just another soldier, Henry wanders among his soldiers before the Battle of Agincourt and listens to what his men think of him, and contemplates the burden of the throne, knowing that a king may be a king but he is still just a man. This is both a beautifully shot scene and an important one for the young king. His speech at Agincourt is understated, spoken to only a few of his soldiers, soft and heartfelt. It is different from any other version of the speech I've ever seen or heard (usually bellowed from the back of a horse before thousands of soldiers), and gave me goosebumps.

I think what really made this whole production pay off for me was it's overall subtlety. As a smaller-scale production of a story of epic proportions, there could have been a lot of room for the battle scenes and larger conflicts of the films to seem less grandiose than they deserve. That doesn't happen here. The lack of a massive budget works in these plays' favor.

During combat, the cameras stick and move in close quarters with the actors. The camera feels like another character in these films. This is especially true in the battle scenes. There were times l felt like I was the proverbial fly on the wall, just hanging out and watching the goings-on in a world we never get to see.

The actors' words flow easily, their conversations natural and fun to listen to.

At one point during a battle Falstaff breaks the fourth wall to bring the audience into the action, letting them in on his inner thoughts, of his planned treachery and manipulation of Hal in order to get himself the title he covets and hasn't earned. It's a moment that's both unexpected (as it doesn't happen anywhere else in the films) and an oddly fun moment in the middle of a fight. Simon Russell Beale plays Falstaff as a bumbling, self-serving sot who plays his connection to Prince Hal until it breaks. His heartbreak  when Hal, now King Henry V of England and Ireland, turns his back on him, is palpable, as is his bewilderment at how this turn of events could have come down.

Other secondary and tertiary characters prove themselves valuable parts of the cast, delivering their lines with verve and passion. Every person involved in this production is worth watching. I especially enjoyed Julie Walters as Mistress Quickly. She was a rough character who still commanded the respect of the lowlifes she was surrounded by, and she displayed a genuine caring for Hal.

As a whole, the film series Hollow Crown is a masterpiece.",1393113600,,5300,4.744842562432139
5847780,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Having seen the three Henry plays on PBS, I quickly ordered the series. Watching the usurpation of Richard II by Bolingbroke (Henry IV), the anguish of a father with a wayward son and heir, and the eventual maturity and leadership of the prodigal son affords the viewer with a unique experience of the tumultuous rise and fall of medieval kings as envisioned by William Shakespeare.

Fully enjoyable.",1391558400,,337,5.035714285714286
5847795,5,B00DQN6IOK,"I would reccomend this to anyone a fan of Shakespeare who is open to new interpretations, as while ""The Hollow Crown"" is very true to its source material, it does take liberties in somewhat shortening the plays or attributing minor lines to different characters. When viewed as both a modern study and an enjoyable adaptation, however, all four plays are absolutely magnificent.
Jeremy Irons as Henry IV offered gravity, frailty, and desperation, which contrast beautifully with the youthful, devil-may-care vivaciousness of Tom Hiddleston's Prince Hal, one always surrounded by looming castles and the shadow of a sick mind, the other never without the glow of firelight and the soundtrack of debauchery and drinking.
In my humble opinion, this is a stunning example of Shakespeare's plays adapted, every line spoken as though there is no different between saying ""Thee"" and ""you.""
Perhaps my only problem with this was with Henry V, which was magnificent- Tom HIddleston looks every bit the leonine king of England, fair Harry- but begs questions about certain directorial choices. Many of Haery's more rousing monologues and speeches have been reduced to being heard by only a few, and in close quarters, making him into a much more intimate Harry than, say, Kenneth Btannagh's, which made the most of a booming voice and sighing quietly once no one was looking. In some ways, it is a fresh look at characterizing Harry, and works well until the St. Crispin's Day speech, which HIddleston delivers well, but with misguided director's vision.
Rather than a rousing, Tolkien-esque rallying cry, it becomes intimate and firm, almost a rebuke to his inner circle of ministers and lords on campaign with him, which seems out of place considering the nature of the speech. It is full of words for the common man, yet Harry delivers them to those of near-equal social status to him, and not the common men in the army waiting below the camp for him.
This unfortunate lapse in judgement, however, can be overlooked by the superb acting, sets, and vision of the overall ""Hollow Crown.""
Even my mother, a former english teacher who flails her hand at every word and spoke volumes about Kenneth Brannagh's ""Henry V"" while watching HIddleston's, admitted on a re-watch of Brannagh that HIddleston had completely won her over.
This deserves its five stars, and is great for fans willing to see new interpretations of Shakespeare, or who have longed for a more modern-looking version of his plays.",1391472000,,2486,5.036407766990291
5847796,5,B00DQN6IOK,An amazing cast! I loved how they made the language of Shakespeare real and accessible. Just a gorgeous series. I am so glad I bought instead of renting!,1391472000,,153,4.5
5847797,4,B00DQN6IOK,"I enjoyed this series very much!

I haven't had the opportunity to see Richard II or Henry IV before, whether live or on film so I was very keen to do so. Excellent performances throughout, and especial shout outs go to Ben Wishaw for his 'messianic' Richard, Jeremy Irons' Henry IV, Tom Hiddleston's Prince Hal and Simon Russell Beale's Falstaff, which is bloody brilliant. I notice that Beale's been getting a bit of bad press in some other reviews here. I disagree entirely. He is excellent. Beale makes Falstaff totally believable and sympathetic, but at the same time lets you see the man's villainy. You want to like him, and you do like him, but ultimately he will rob you, let you down or get you into serious trouble.

Of the three (four?), I probably found Henry V the least satisfying, in that to me there felt like there were big chunks missing. I say this as a dilettante appreciator of Shakespeare, more used to film than performance, let alone sitting down to pore over every word in a book. So, for my generation, it was the Ken Branagh one that was the benchmark, sitting on top of the Laurence Olivier one. Branagh's had bits that Olivier's didn't and vice versa. The other version I have seen is I think the RSC one, where they are all running around in army cammo, Falklands War style. I understand that you can trim Shakespeare (there's a lot in it), but this Hollow Crown version feels a bit like all three versions' missing bits combined. No conspiracy, no bitchy frogs squabbling pre-Agincourt, no leek scene. There is the bit where Henry orders the death of the prisoners, which I hadn't seen before.

All that said, what is there is very good, I think. Hiddleston is excellent. One thing I wasn't convinced by however, was the Agincourt speech, but having watched the extras, I'm not inclined to think it was his fault. They scaled it back to an intimate conversation between Henry and his commanders, rather than Henry and his army. Branagh's rousing speech, underlaid with Patrick Doyle's swirling stirring building  glorious score, followed by a 'HELL, YEAH!' from the men, totally made me want to run up to the screen and attempt to get into the movie itself, which would of course then cause the cinema staff to call the police, etc. After that, the Agincourt speech is going to be hard to top. But, this version is what it is and should be assessed on its own merits, so try not to have previous versions rattling around in your head when you watch this. Good luck with that.

Production side is very good TV quality. There's a few liberties taken here and there with costume, but generally, pretty good. A lot of marvellous locations are used, both interior and exteriors, so it has a great look. Casting, of course, is excellent. This series fits for me at any rate into a weird zone between wanting to look historically accurate and not really caring. There are a few black actors used, for example Paterson Joesph as the Duke of York, which jerk you out of historical context as far as a film goes. On stage that wouldn't be a problem at all, but there's kind of that unspoken deal with a historically set film that somehow you are a time traveller invisibly observing events, even though you know you aren't (hopefully). If you set up a reality in the film in which these things don't matter a damn (for example the Anthony Hopkins Titus Andronicus film version), then it's all OK, but the Hollow Crown fits into a weird zone of looking mostly historically accurate and based in reality, but with odd bits that jerk you out, like for example, a black Duke of York. I start wondering, ""How did that happen? I wonder if he faced prejudice from the other nobles growing up? It is the Middle Ages, after all. Are the Yorks all black? Did he come from somewhere else? He seems pretty posh, he must have grown up in England. I wonder what his story is. Bet it's interesting. Oh, bugger, I've missed what that scene was about. Rewind!"" Paterson Joseph is very entertaining on the extras where he talks about his genuine panic in the fight scenes adding to the authenticity of the finished result.

But on to the important stuff; the armour and battle scenes.

I am an armour enthusiast. Unfortunately, there is a fair amount of armour dodging going on in the Hollow Crown, especially in the battle of Agincourt. There's some nice/interesting stuff in Richard II, although the two knights at the start look like they are wearing late 15th century stuff with 13th century helms, which I found a bit jarring (NERD). Battle scene-wise, we are talking limited numbers, similar to Branagh's battle scenes, so if you've seen those, this is the same kind of thing. Close up clang-clang-argh stuff, blood, mud, splat, argh, ergh, my young life has been snuffed, oh, the tragic brutal intimacy of death in battle. All good fun.

What does irritate me is the large amount of helmet dodging as well. Paterson Joseph's York gets a hideous knitted chainmail coif and some interesting looking leather and padded armour more at home on the SCA tourney field than in a medieval battle. Hiddleston has a 'orrible looking breastplate, totally not period, with some pauldrons much later than 1415 or whatever it was, possibly cannibalized off some of the suits they had in Luc Besson's Joan of Arc. Again, he doesn't get a helmet. Why is the king of England galloping all over the battlefield without a helmet? I'm talking to you too, Ken Branagh, I haven't forgotten. Even the Froggy knights are charging without helmets. They would have been a Froggy helmetapalooza on horseflesh! Put some helmets on, you Froggy pillocks! Someone's going to hit you in the head! See? Why are you bleeding artistically from your head everywhere? Didn't wear a helmet. Didn't even start off with one so that you could clumsily lose it in the fray, but at least tick the box 'started fight with helmet.' No one listens.

The battle of Shrewsbury is quite well done with just enough armour to satisfy my jaded palate (well, nearly). For Henry V, they wanted a 'stripped down look' for the English. Not sure why. Armour is cool.

All my complaining aside, ultimately what the Hollow Crown is about is Shakespeare's plays. I think they do come through very well, and that this is well worth the purchase.",1391385600,,6294,4.672382671480144

5847804,2,B00DQN6IOK,"This would have been a very admirable Shakespeare series, except half of it was ruined by vulgarity and sexually suggestive scenes.  My H.S. English teacher husband and I had to dispose of the offensive Henry IV parts I and II (two of the four dvds).  In one of the scenes, the wench flashed us her completely naked buttocks, full-view, as she ascended a staircase.  In another scene with Falstaff in the following Henry IV, Doll's gyrations were completely unnecessary and lewd.  I think Shakespeare himself would have been utterly appalled!

The Shakespearean speech was also far less comprehensible in these two Henry IV dvds, than in the first and last (Richard II and Henry V).

I would encourage my own adult kids to view the Richard II and Henry V, but never the middle two in this series.  Why do directors think they need to show us too much sexual stuff?

In fact, his portrayal of Richard doesn't hold a candle to Tom Hiddleston's performances as Prince Hal/King Henry V. The transformation of self-indulgent party boy Prince Hal into warrior king leader of men King Henry is entirely believable and riveting in Hiddleston's hands.

5847842,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Superb on the whole, and worth watching all the way through, over and over again.

1. Richard II: Some of Shakespeare's most gorgeous poetry, a heartbreaking meditation on the rights and responsibilities of a king and his subjects. Here the play is intelligently adapted and filmed with a formalism and beauty that suits the material (Rupert Goold directs).

Ben Whishaw (accompanied by a pet monkey!) inhabits the character of the frivolous but articulate monarch so completely that it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. The other characters, played by superb actors, swirl around him with increasing agitation, but Richard is the center of the play's gravity and remains so to his tragic end. (At first I wrote that he was the ""center of the play's energy,"" but that's not quite it: he seems to inhabit time differently from the other characters, as if time slows down when it gets close to him.)

Nonetheless, I have reservations about this adaptation. All the hagiography (visuals connecting Richard to Christ and St Sebastian) contribute to the film's beauty, but they also impose a Richard-as-martyr interpretation that reduces the richness of Shakespeare's treatment of politics in this play.  A lighter touch would have made the allusions more powerful and also given the audience enough critical distance to see how Richard's self-representation is relativized by the point of view of all the other characters.

(One note that applies to all four films: the adapters have cut a great deal of text to make the films fit a TV schedule. The cutting is usually judicious, and viewers who don't know the plays should have no trouble understanding the interpersonal dimension and how relationships shift with the political action. But if you want to connect all the dots politically, you won't quite be able to. The lines that made that possible have sometimes been cut.)

2. Henry IV pt. 1. This is possibly Shakespeare's greatest history play, though often eclipsed in popular acclaim by the crowd-pleasing Henry V. Maybe some viewers will rethink their preferences now, since the Hollow Crown adaptation of Henry IV pt. 1 is easily the best episode in this very good series. But historians beware: Shakespeare takes great liberties with the historical record in order to create this brilliant plot and compelling characters.

Despite the title, this is really an ensemble piece that balances four characters who have almost equal time on screen: Henry IV, his son and heir Prince Hal, the Prince's foil the rebellious Hotspur (Henry Percy), and Sir John Falstaff, who competes with the king as a pseudo father figure for the young man. So this is not a play *about* Henry IV. It's about Henry V before the fact, caught between the competing influence of two older men, and opposed to another young warrior of the same name.

The directing (by Richard Eyre) and cast are perfect. Jeremy Irons is the still pugnacious but ill and beleaguered king. Simon Russell Beale is Falstaff, a charming but unscrupulous individual whom Beale invests with just enough dignity and humanity to prevent him from becoming a caricature. (This is not the cuddly, jolly Falstaff some may expect, but a fully realized human being.) Joe Armstrong is Hotspur, an inspiring but reckless young field commander, bursting with misdirected energy (he aspires ""to pluck bright honor from the palefaced moon""). Tom Hiddleston is a Prince Hal who would rather play a commoner (and watch himself do it) than assume the role of apprentice-king that his father would impose on him. He's handsome, charismatic, clever, calculating, entitled (in all senses), occasionally insensitive, occasionally insolent... But you see that this young man has the potential for political survival that the pugilistic Hotspurr (so loveably, in this version) lacks.

It's enough to keep you riveted the first time through, with wonderful nuances that emerge on later viewings. Watch, for example, how Hal manages to enjoy his privilege even while pretending not to, and watch the unstated antagonism of Falstaff and Poins (David Dawson), a young friend of Hal's, as they vie for the prince's attention. Enjoy the peripheral scenes that deepen our understanding of Hotspur by showing his interactions with his wife (Michelle Dockery) and his Welsh conspirators. (And thank God they decided to keep those Welsh scenes, which are a treasure.) The exquisite voiceovers continue with Hal's ""I know you all"" soliloquy and Falstaff's meditation on honor.

3. Henry IV pt. 2. The same director and most of the same cast. It's not quite as good, and that's Shakespeare's fault. He set the bar too high with the preceding plays (and the Henry V to come), and Henry IV pt. 2 suffers from the betweens. Everything that happens is foreshadowed/necessitated by Part 1 and superbly handled, and we know pretty well how this one has to end, but the action just isn't as tight.

It's still a good play, with some truly exquisite scenes (take, for example, Henry IV's soliloquy on sleep and as well as the last father-son interview between Henry IV and Hal, where Irons makes his final, *spectacular* scene). Also excruciating moments: this is the play where Hal rejects Falstaff definitively.

The true wonder of this play, though, is in the characterization. The characters that survive to this point have acquired depth they didn't possess in Part 1, where they were (mostly) new to us and there wasn't room to let them grow. A few minor characters get more time: Doll Tearsheet (Maxine Peake, of the BBC's Silk) had a nonspeaking roll in Part I but here gets another one of those exquisite scenes (with Falstaff) that turns into a masterclass of acting. A couple of new characters appear: someone found a cherubic child to play Falstaff's cheeky page, and David Bamber is the piteously inept Justice Shallow (remember Mr. Collins from the old BBC Pride and Prejudice? He's back, aged 20 years!). And it feels ungracious not to mention all the others by name, they're so wonderful, but this review is getting long....

Though Tom Hiddleston's performance is excellent throughout the series, I think it's best in this play --- despite the fact that his character has very little to do! Hamlet-like, he watches and thinks, a mode that suits this very intelligent actor.

The score is heavy on Handel towards the end, which is anachronistic whichever way you calculate it, but lovely nonetheless. No one does coronation music better.

4. Henry V. New director, Thea Sharrock, but still with Hiddleston playing Henry. I'm so glad that they decided to keep the same actor who played the prince in the Henry IV plays and allow him to complete the personal growth that his character had begun. Unlike Branagh's Henry, Hiddleston's did not spring up from the ground one day as a fully-formed politician, rhetorician, and military tactition. He's a talented individual who found himself, at a young age, with more responsibility than he wanted or was sure he could handle, and he's improvising (sometimes well, sometimes not). Yet he makes a charismatic and inspiring king: not as gregarious as Branagh, and more thoughtful. Hiddleston has an Olivier-like subtlety. But Olivier's Henry was very self-consciously a theatrical creation, in an adaptation from which every ambivalence had been purged. Hiddleston finds himself in a realist adaptation with a screenwriter and director not afraid to explore the darker shadows of Henry's character. How could this new adaptation fail?

Maybe by beginning with a funeral? That is how the Hollow Crown's Henry V begins: with his funeral. Is this Richard II? Henry IV pt 1? Henry V is in fact not one of Shakespeare's ""sad stories of the death of kings."" Henry's death isn't part of the play's action and is mentioned only very indirectly in the final lines (historical factoid: he died, probably of dysentery, seven years after the action of the play). Instead, the text begins with a bombastic prologue (""Oh for a muse of fire!"") that announces youthful energy and ambition.

There are several problems with this funeral. It overwrites Shakespeare's dramatic structure by making the entire play a flashback, but the flashback technique has been so overused to drum up suspense in mediocre TV shows that it now indicates the desperation of poor writing. Since Henry's death is never dramatized or explained in the play, the funeral will confuse viewers who don't know British history. But most of all, seeing Henry's bloodless corpse on a bier kills the energy that should carry through this play.

The uninspiring score and staid pacing don't help. I can't tell whether this episode is slower than the preceding ones, or whether the problem is that the deliberate pacing of Richard II and Henry IV suit the melancholic material, whereas the energy of the language in Henry V demands a greater speed which the director has resisted. There are very few scenes that feel slow, but the scenes don't follow upon each other very fast. Take this comparison: the Hollow Crown adaptation cuts more scenes than Branagh did, but it also has a longer playing time.

To be fair, Sharrock had the most difficult task of all the directors in this series, since she alone had to direct a play that had already been brought to the big screen twice with great success (Olivier, 1944 and Branagh, 1989). Everyone is going to make comparisons. The new adapter's challenge was to avoid simply replicating the earlier adaptations, and the solution --- which ought to have been adequate in itself --- was Hiddleston's reinterpretation of the character. But the opening funeral sequence is one of several moments when I had the impression that the adapters made strange decisions just to be different. In addition, York is stabbed in the back while wandering in a forest, rather than dying heroically on the battlefield. The adapters eliminated the murder of the English boys and pack animals by the French, but kept Henry's order to kill the French prisoners, which in the play was motivated by the murder of the boys (and not simply by seeing French horsemen still in the field, which, in the play, only inspired him to threaten to kill the prisoners).

So there's a strong anti-heroic aspect to this adaptation that extends to every single character. In fact, Shakespeare's play does have a darker side, politically and psychologically. Henry attempts to do the right thing, but is he motivated by a sense of justice or by political expediency? And he sometimes descends to savage threats or even actions. The other characters represent a full spectrum, from the clergy's cynicism to York's heroism to Pistol and his friends' cowardice and opportunism. That diversity and Henry's many unfathomable moods create a rich and balanced representation of war which has never quite been recaptured in the film versions. The screenplay of Olivier's 1944 version entirely eliminated Henry's potential for savagery (national necessity: this was England, 1944). Branagh's more realist version came closest to balance; he included much of the negative material but wasn't willing to include Henry's killing of the prisoners. The Hollow Crown puts it all back in and exacerbates it with the choices I've described. To my mind, this latest adaptation is as reductive (though in the opposite way) as Olivier's, but maybe when in the year 2012 we think of warriors, that's what our imagination gives us: individuals running around pointlessly in a wood, stabbing each other in the back.

Still, this adaptation has one big advantage over the others. The scene with Henry and Princesse Catherine of France (Mlanie Thierry) is the loveliest I've ever seen. This was the weak link in Branagh's adaptation, because Emma Thompson, though a wonderful actress, cannot convince when playing a Frenchwoman (she sounds like an Englishwoman reciting French she learned in school). The scene was problematic in the Olivier version, too, because the screenplay had already established the French as ridiculous caricatures, an impression that cannot help but color Catherine herself. (Yes, I know Shakespeare spelled it with a ""K""... I'm doing this on purpose.) Sharrock happily cast a young French star. To my mind, Thierry's first speaking scene (the English lesson) is too static and doesn't rise to the level of Olivier or Branagh's interpretations, but during the wooing something magical happens between Thierry and Hiddleston. It's almost enough to make up for that funeral. Almost.

So when it comes to those comparisons, this is what I would say: Olivier's Henry V was largely a waste of a good actor, though it's still interesting and worth watching for individual scenes (the opening sequence and the night before Agincourt). Branagh's film remains the best screen adaptation of the play. Despite being a long-time Branagh fan, until I did this three-way Henry V comparison I didn't fully appreciate how capacious and generous Branagh's imagination as a director is. Sharrock's adaptation, on the other hand, has a thesis, and if you don't go along with it you'll have trouble liking this version. But Hiddleston's interpretation of the character of Henry V has more depth than Branagh's, so for the character, I'd say that Hiddleston is the best.",1385424000,5,13287,5.068618481244282

All of the acting in this series is top-notch, high-caliber and very little (if any) disappointment. The British really do it best when it comes to adapting Shakespeare from the stage onto film. The production is fantastic, the costumes are wonderful, and the acting is superb. Ben Winshaw impresses as Richard II, Jeremy Irons was born to be king with his sharp portrayal of Henry IV, and Tom Hiddleston steals the show (and women's hearts) over and over and over again as Prince Hal/Henry V. I swear, there is nothing that man CAN'T do! Watching him lose himself in this role was a wondrous thing to behold.

The war scenes are intense and moving without the gratuitous violence. The cinematography is gorgeous.

The only thing I could possibly think of that would be ""negative"" would be the Shakespearean language (though personally, I love it), but I can understand why some people could get lost or bored - though it still astonishes me that people feel that way. Oh well. To each their own.

I love the Henriad (Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, Henry V) but it is the 'prequel', Richard II, that truly shines in this collection. Ben Whishaw, as the titular king, is spectacular, and director Rupert Goold's visual approach to the story is revelatory. The set would be worth it for this film alone.

Luckily, you'll also get Jeremy Irons as Henry IV and Tom Hiddleston as Prince Hal / Henry V. I was a bit disappointed by Simon Russell Beale's Falstaff. (Perhaps they drowned him in a bit too much makeup.) It's tough territory, given how good Kenneth Branaugh's Henry V (which incorporates several Falstaff scenes), already was. What Branaugh couldn't do that this series does is show the sweeping forces of history. When Shakespeare gives Henry V his ""Upon the king"" speech on the eve of Agincourt, we know exactly what he means when by ""the fault my father made in compassing the crown"".

Let us hope that Henry VI (""in infant bands crowned king"") and Richard III will be the next historical tetralogy from this team of producers.",1384819200,2,1243,4.723502304147465

5847856,4,B00DQN6IOK,"The Hollow Crown series is an excellent example of a movie adaptation that helps bring to light an inner -usually unexpected- layer of Shakespeares plays. Contrary to accepted belief, the inner layer is very difficult, or even impossible, to discern through theater productions. By the same token, movie productions are more challenging because they are more sensitive to any changes or modifications of the original plot. This is particularly obvious when watching Richard II directed by Rupert Goold. For example, cutting off the scene with John of Gaunt and the Duchess of Gloucester (I.2) removed a critical piece of information that is needed to understand the overall plot. This scene defines the concept of King and, at the same time, shows the true nature of King Richard II. It is the gap between the concept of King and the person wearing the crown that drives the plot of the play. The entire series of the History Plays is an illustration of the process that allows bridging this gap.",1384041600,2,996,4.934523809523809
5847857,5,B00DQN6IOK,"This series is excellent. I saw all four episodes on Masterpiece Theater and really enjoyed them. The acting by the entire cast is exceptional and cannot be bettered. The lines were delivered clearly and every word was comprehensible. I will not single out any individual actor since that would imply that the other cast members were not at the same level and that would not be true. I will say that the small budget was noticeable since the fighting scenes, which should have had hundreds or thousands of men, had numbers that were more suitable for a large stage. Yet the producers did the best they could and certainly the sets and costumes were entirely realistic and provided verisimilitude. Needless to say, cuts were made in the original plays but that is understandable; furthermore, it does not detract from the power of these performances.

But don't buy this DVD version. Wait for the Blu-Ray HD version and purchase it. There is no reason in this modern age to ever buy a DVD again unless it was actually videotaped at that lower resolution and no HD version will ever be available.

Of course there have to be cuts to the text, but some of them seemed unnecessary, arbitrary or even wrong. Why leave out Hotspur's great speech before the battle of Shrewsbury just to have a few more seconds of the battle? And with regard to the Southampton plot in Henry V, if you must leave it out at least make a clean cut; don't leave in a reference to the traitors (""were all thy children kind and natural"") which then appears to refer to Bardolph, Nym and Pistol! Finally, it was a bad decision to delete the French frivolity before Agincourt, so meaningful as a contrast to the English thoughtfulness, as exemplified in the soldier Michael Williams.  But on the whole, this embodiment of Shakespeare's words in the visuality of the film medium is successful and compelling.

I bought the discs because I caught the last 10 minutes of Henry V (the third of the three kings in ""The Hollow Crown"") on TV, and I understood not only the words the king spoke but also the soul behind the words. The actor -- Tom Hiddleston -- conveyed the lines with such skill they were easy to understand and a joy to listen to. So I used part of a gift certificate to get the set.

It knocked my socks off! All three have incredible staging, intriguing interpretation of character, along with drama, passion and such beautiful language. Even the secondary characters mesh fine acting (more like movie acting than stage acting) with their  lines to convey the stories.

5847880,5,B00DQN6IOK,"I have not purchased this set yet but I intend too.  I find the current media filled with mediocrity.  No originality in our drama.  Flat and unprofitable as the immortal bard would say.  Laurence Olivier began directing Shakespearean plays and won an Oscar for Hamlet as Best Movie (being one of them).  As an avid Shakespearean patron and advocate and I applaud efforts to bring these plays to film.  It takes a special talent to bring the dialogue of the plays to life.  I find that Tom Hiddleston does that.  I have been waiting for the plays of Henry IV to be brought to film in vivid way with meaningful dialogue to match.  The original series of Shakespearean plays done by PBS for me were boring.  No attempt was made to bring the genius of Shakespeare to a public unaware of this body of work.

This project was well thought out, dramatically well acted, and a cinematic success.  I have seen Olivier, and Branagh as Henry V.  Tom Hiddleston does a very good job in the the roll of Henry V, and brings a side to the part that is quite unexpected.  I saw this set of plays on PBS.  I have never seen the Game of Thrones, I probably never will.  If you are totally unfamiliar with these History plays this would be an opportunity to elevate your taste for the Immortal Bard by watching these movies.  Many films where actors come out of popular media and try to act out Shakespeare are empty because the actors seem so distant from the dialogue's meaning and scope.  This not the case here.

5847888,5,B00DQN6IOK,"""The Hollow Crown"" is an absolutely wonderful rending of Shakespeare's finest histories, and truly, the 3 plays must be watched consequentially for the viewer to come away with the picture that the weight of the crown offers. For this is what this film is about:
How the burden of the Crown is treated by 3 very different men. What makes man a king? This is the question that Whishaw, Irons, and Hiddleston so beautifully answer.

Richard II:
Richard II is a poetically vainglorious King whose belief in the divine right of his monarchy blinds him to his atrocious lack of responsibility. Whishaw's performance is superb, and he truly must be commended for capturing the dramatic tragedy of his character with such devotion, enthusiasm, and understanding. We feel great pity for Richard even as he disgusts with his arrogant assumptions and foolish actions. He thinks himself like a god, and deserves everything that comes to him, but it is nearly impossible not to watch with despondent sorrow how he has made his own pit with his selfish ambition, and vainglorious attitude, especially toward Henry of Bolingsbroke, his cousin, and future successor. His drama and ostentatious behavior can be painful to watch at times, and you want to put your face in your hands at his blindness and self-pity. Whishaw subtly reminds us of the biblical king Reaboham, Solomon's son (for those who are familiar) and how he surrounded himself with young advisers who encouraged him to force a hand of iron upon his people, and the rebellion that it brought him. (It is quite helpful to read parts of the Bible with Shakespeare, as many of his stories and ideas were biblically inspired. Reaboham's story in the beginning of Chronicles/Kings is nearly a perfect parallel to King Richard II)
Part of Richard's Tragedy comes from his blindness stemming from his obscene self-awareness- He literally does not know what kind of king he really is. He doesn't do anything intentionally evil- he is simply proud and a fool and he doesn't realize what an irresponsible fool he was until the very, very end, embodied in his (and THE most powerful line in the film: ""I wasted Time, and now Time is wasting me.""
Rating: 5/5

King Henry IV
Henry of Bolingsbroke ascends his cousin's throne as King Henry IV at the end of Richard II, and while he does not force the throne from Richard per se, he is seen by many as a military usurper, and people are disturbed by how he came by the throne. This was one of the first times that a King had done so in this nature. It takes place some 25ish year afterward, and we see how the crown is a burden to King Henry. He wants to be a good king, and he is an effective one. He feels a great deal of guilt about his late cousin Richard who perished tragically in a misunderstanding leading to his murder in prison on Henry's behalf. Henry bore no ill-will toward Richard and feels responsible for the former King's miserable demise. Irons spectacularly captures this king who bears his crown with indomitable will, and strength, yet wearied by a burden that he knows he brought upon himself even though he didn't directly ask for it. He didn't refuse when it was offered him, and we see a man who wishes that he did. It is hard to be a king. His burden has hardened him with the guilt it brings, but he bears the responsibility because he MUST, contrary to the appalling lack of responsibility shown by his eldest son, Prince Hal. (Harry/Henry)
Henry IV is also about Prince Hal's coming-of-age in a sense. Hiddleston, charmingly regal as always, steps right into the role from scene one, and is persuasive in the frivolous role of the careless prince despite the elegance and aristocratic refinement that his characters usually radiate. Indeed, it is a huge testament to his acting ability to embody such an irresponsibly role believably because of his naturally profound spirit of mature eloquence. Nevertheless, those talents serve him well as Prince Hal (and pretty much every other role he inhabits). One thing that sets Hiddleston a rather large notch above the rest of his peers is his absolute embracing of the Shakespearean language. This may sound like a strange thing to say- certainly all the actors have an immense appreciation for Shakespeare, and it is seen in the care they give to their inhabited characters. YET- and this is in no way a pro/con statement, nor a knock to any of the other actors' extreme talent- they speak Shakespeare like it's written- like poetry. It is quite lovely and embodies our perception of Shakespeare in the truest sense. However, from scene one, Hiddleston comes in and speaks Shakespeare like it's english. (No surprise- the man normally talks like this anyways). Okay, so let me rephrase that. He speaks Shakespeare like he's speaking everyday normal english, and doesn't even think about what he's saying, and you can tell that he understand Exactly what he's saying, whereas the other actors, it comes off more as traditional Shakespeare poetic prose. Make no mistake: Hiddleston certainly does prose when called for, but his command of Shakespeare is so profound, that an""unshakespearized"" audience can grasp Shakespeare in his mouth more easily than the other characters, simply because he speaks it with the common spirit of man, while at the same time sounding regal. In other words, Hiddleston actually understands what he's saying, so the people watching understand what he's saying. (If he doesn't, then he's an even better actor than we think) People don't talk like poets in real life.
This is merely an observation which not all may agree with, but I'm sure that most will appreciate in the sense that we like to understand what we're hearing/watching.

All right, back from the Hiddles Praise Train, (amazing how quickly we can derail, ehehe) Hal's evolution as a character is what the primary focus is of King Henry IV, despite the title. We see how even though Hal acts foolish and irresponsible, he does not do so out of an inherent immaturity. Rather, he is so fearful of the crown, he runs from what he knows will soon be his burden to bear. He has seen what the crown has done to his father in all these years, and there is nothing he fears more than becoming his father. He doesn't just loathe it, he dreads it. He masks this fear with flippancy, all the while knowing that he will soon have to bear this burden himself. His true turning-about comes when he realizes that he has a choice: The crown is what he makes it. He will choose what kind of man he will be, and in doing so, he will determine the kind of king he is. The man makes the king- the king does not make the man. It is a beautiful portrayal of a man making the CHOICE to be responsible versus immature, and Accepting what he was born for. He loves his father, and knows that the crown is responsible for his father's weariness. It is a powerful scene between Irons and Hiddleston (Well, all their scenes are powerful!) when Hal takes the crown from his father's bedside when he believes his ill father to be dead. The King is furious with his son and accuses him of being power-hungry, and an irresponsible brat, basically, until he learns that what Hal did, he did out of love, not of greed. King Henry knows what the crown as done to him, and before he dies, he is able to see himself through his son's eyes, and dies, but not before knowing that Hal will be a better king- a better man- than he was, and this brings him a peace that we are sure he has not known since Richard's death.
Henry IV can get slow at times- especially part II, and the character of Falstaff dominates the screen. Simon Russel Beale's portrayal of Falstaff is both brutally honest, and somewhat bittersweet, as he capture's the character of a man who is, though outwardly adorable at first, is a flatterer and coward at heart, and has no integrity and no honor. Yet, we do feel sorry for him- unlike Richard, he knows his own faults- but he will never change. His heart is lazy and hardened with the years of his scornful habits. Yet, he invokes pity because of his affection for Hal, and Hal's justified rejection of him at the end, during his coronation. Falstaff fully deserves it, and it is a huge milestone for the new King Henry V, but it makes the audience shake their heads. He had it coming, but it hurts because he doesn't understand himself enough, and so he cannot understand the vastly out-of-his-league Henry. The whole of Henry IV is worth watching simply for the final scene.
Rating: 5/5

Henry V:
It has been said that no one does Shakespeare better than Branaugh- and in many ways, that is true. However, Branaugh's influence clearly comes across in Hiddleston's rendition of the british monarch, though they play Henry with slightly different attitudes, of course. Branaugh put such care into each line, that it is difficult to imagine how anyone could top it. And, to be fair to both sides... Hiddleston doesn't top Branaugh- but I'd put his portrayal of Henry V as Branaugh's equal. They portray the King differently, emphasizing slightly different traits while keeping the heart of the character whole. There is honestly so much to be said about King Henry V, that I really couldn't, not without writing an essay. (Which I've practically already done.)  The speeches are pure, and the adaption marvelous, and Hiddelston captures Shakespeares intent with a different attitude than Branaugh; less fiery, but just as hearty, less bravado and more introspective, just as careful, being no less genuine or inspirational than Branaugh was while delivering the same lines 24 years earlier. Gotta say, Branaugh's Agincourt speech is tough to beat- Hiddleston's, while perhaps less memorable, is no less meaningful or insightful. They go about the speech with different attitudes: Branaugh speaking to his whole army in a ""Son of Scotland/Gondor"" moment, while Hiddleston speaks quietly to the hearts of the brothers in arms that he has fought with for so long, giving them a quiet courage and strength. The two renditions can't really be compared because the intent was different. No less effective, in a sense. It depends on which of the two arts more speaks to you. As a whole, in and of itself Henry V is a true masterpiece, and hinges on Hiddleston's impressive performance as the ascended, challenged King of England rising in faith and courage in a cause he believes just. Tender romance aside. (On that note, it's fabulous when actors actually understand a foreign language they're hearing/supposed to be speaking. Gives performance so much more weight.) Hiddleston's enthusiasm for his role and in his character is infectious, and as an audience, if Henry V was as noble a man and leader of integrity and honor as both Hiddleston and Branaugh make him out to be, there is very little that would stop us from joining his army. (Something the former seems to have done in spades these days.)

Rating: 5/5

Conclusion:
To get the full meaning of the intent behind ""The Hollow Crown"", it must be watched consequentially, even though any one of them make for an excellent singular viewing. It is an adaption made much more comprehensive than the original plays, while still keeping everything meaningful that Shakespeare intended. A careful, genuine performance by talented, dedicated actor in whom is clearly scene a vast appreciation for their heart, which, as an interested viewer, makes the experience so much more enjoyable and real.

5847889,5,B00DQN6IOK,"The 4 plays of the Henriad are the pinnacle of Shakespeare's histories, and a full-on cinematic production like this is long overdue.  Branagh's also brilliant Henry V was 24 years ago (1989) and the BBC's filmed stage version of the complete tetrology was half a century ago (with Sean Connery as Hotspurwho now gets a graceful cameo in this production of Richard IIand Judy Dench as Princess Katherine)

Like runners of a relay, Ben Whitshaw gets the series off to a terrific start with his imperious, effete, vain but fearful Richard II.  He knocks the major soliloquies out of the park (...let us sit upon the ground and tell sad tales of the death of kings...).  As a gratuitous bonus, we get Patrick Stewart delivering this blessed England as John of Gaunt, and the cinematography is subtle, drawing us to the lavish details of  the sets and costumes of that distant world.

Who better to carry the two-part middle of the race but Jeremy Irons as Henry IV.  He is regal in his tirades against his wastrel son Hal, and haunting in showing us Henry's inner doubt and shame at how he came by the crown.  But this part of the series really pulls away from the pack with Hal, Falstaff and the East Cheap tavern scenes.  Yes, they're boisterous and rowdy as we expect, but there is a realism, a grimy intimacy to this portrayal that brings us right into the hardscrabble world of Hal's denizen companions.  Tom Hiddleston then treads a magnificent line between low-life and heir apparent.  His Hal at last lets us see and understand what an enormous psychological distance he must travel in order to redeem time when men think least I will as Henry V.  Simon Russell Beale's Falstaff is complex and multi-faceted.  Not Roger Allam's jovial, blowhard Falstaff of the Shakespeare's Globe stage version (also well worth it on DVD) Beale's Falstaff can be small, utterly self-absorbed and at times pathetic.  He and Hiddleston together make the banish not poor Jack scenes as emotionally painful as they truly can be, as we see Hal using his tavern friends for his own revelry, and them clinging desperately to the false hope that the prince will deliver them from their lot in life.  Yet through this mean existence shine tender moments of Falstaff's parting from Mistress Quickly, and countless other vignettes of character portrayal.

It falls to anchor leg Tom Hiddleston to reach the finish line as Henry V.  Having  Branagh leave an indelible stamp on the role in his 1989 version left Hiddleston no choice but to chart his own course.  Accordingly, we have Henry more like Ike before D-Day with We few, we happy few than the rousing cheerleader that was Branagh's version.  The result is a Henry V who is conscious and deliberate about his kingship rather than just charging through it.  We also get brilliantly deep portrayals of Exeter's diplomacy with France from Anton Lesser, Julie Walters' steadfast Mistress Quickly, and so many other supporting roles.

5847896,4,B00DQN6IOK,"The Crown Jewel of this set is surely ""Richard II"" with a toweringly masterful performance by Ben Whitslaw.  Everything about the production is right - the sets, the symbols, the costumes, the supporting players (except for the actor playing Aumerle who spends the film looking woefully dumbfounded and lost).  This is a Richard for the ages.
  Then we come to Henry IV I starring Jeremy Irons as a roughhewn Henry whose kingdom seems overrun by rebels from every corner.  He is by turns pensive, fiery, sad, fatherly, and tough as nails.  His berating of the recalcitrant Hal is masterful as his rage becomes palpable.  His death scene also is a revelation as Irons gives a master class in the art of acting.

  But how sad it is to yearn for Henry to come back in frame,  There will be no yearning here however. The play has two father figures for Hal to choose from and Henry is usually the dark, scolding one while sweet Jack Falstaff lightens the somber mood that lours over this not so merry England, providing the audience with much needed comic relief.  Well, Simon Russell Beale does everything in his power to deaden the character.  It is Falstaff who is the tired scold, a scowling drunk who has no levity in him.  One might argue that Shakespeare's characters are there to be interpreted and so this interpretation of the fat knight is as valid as any other.  Ah, but one would not want to see a Macbeth smile gleefully while reciting his ""If it were done"" speech or for Lady Macbeth to skip and dance through her sleepwalking scene, much less to see Hamlet laugh hysterically while listening to the ghost of his dead father recalling his murder most foul, because these interpretations would cut against the grain of the characters as written and make a mockery of the plays while insulting the audience's taste.  People laugh at this Falstaff (indeed Tim Hiddleston cannot keep a straight face when he is within ten yards of the man) but one can only wonder what they are laughing and guffawing at.  It is akin to watching Chris Rock being portrayed by Ben Stein (or Hoffman as Lenny Bruce for that matter) - the lines may be good but the delivery is much like that of a garbage truck.  One cannot of course be sure where the fault lies, in the star or in the director (who, in the bonus featurette praises Beale to the skies), but dread fault it is.  Why would Hal seek a man as craggy as his father to hang out with?  It's analogous to someone swearing off Jonathan Winters to hang out with Robin Williams - going from steak to hamburger.  One can almost envisage the planning that went into this - ""Tell you what. .let's do someting radical, something no one would expect. .a Falstaff with a perpetual frownlet on.  That'll get them talking.""  This is the only production of the Henriad in which the audience sympathizes with Hal's ditching the knight.  I will admit this: Beale's expression when Hal banishes him is heartbreaking - but certainly would have been more so had his Falstaff ever come across as more than a rather sad figure whose jollity is but a thin mask for his life weariness.

  Let me make it clear that it is not Beale's acting which is at fault.  He is a very good actor who is misguidedly playing the wrong part.  Were he playing Jacques in ""As You Like It"" he'd steal the show.  You want a great Falstaff?  Try Roger Allam's ingenious portrayal in the RSC series or the almost as good Anthony Quayle in the BBC production from the early 1980s.

  ""Henry V"" opens with the king's funeral and with the gravelly fine narration of the grand John Hurt evoking a ""Muse of Fire"".  Hiddleston acquits himself admirably.  His line readings are natural, bespeaking a man casting himself in a new mold having spent years learning the world of taverns and whores and thieves.  His ""St. Crispian"" speech is spoken rather than bellowed which, though unorthodox, is dramatically effective.
  The bonus scenes accompanying the DVDs offer little besides pats on the backs for the directors and stars, which is what one expects, but it would have been so much better to have someone speak of Shakespeare's art and the way he molded and shaped historical events to suit the drama.  Hotspur, for example, was at least 45 at the Battle of Shrewsbury, but the last thing the Bard needed was an additonal father figure and so 45 becomes 20.  Too, ""Henry V"" (as do the rest of these plays)raises important questions about the nature of kingship.  Is Henry a good king or a cold war mongerer willing to sacrifice untold thousands for the glitter and dust of personal glory?  How did the Tudor myth of the king or queen as God's own appointed influence Shakespeare's characterization of Richard II?  After all, no one in the 14th century thought of a king as God's viceroy on earth.  He was simply the first among many.  These issues might have been effectively addressed in the bonus featurettes rather than the tired old ""He is the best actor/director/costume designer/stunt coordinator it has been my pleasure to work with.""
  The set is worth purchasing if only for Ben, Rory Kinnear, and Jeremy Irons, but I daresay most will fast forward Falstaff which is a damn shame as he is one of Shakespeare's finest creations.",1379635200,19,5237,4.635179153094462

5847898,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Shakespeare's historical plays can be a tough sell -- after all, they are political dramas that most modern people don't know much about.

But ""The Hollow Crown"" is up to that challenge, bringing to life Shakespeare's famous historical tetralogy (""Richard II,"" both parts of ""Henry IV"" and ""Henry V"") with an all-star cast and beautiful direction. The backgrounds are lush and the direction is powerful, but the real credit here goes to Tom Hiddleston, Patrick Stewart, Ben Whishaw and Jeremy Irons.

In ""Richard II,"" a feud between Henry Bolingbroke (Rory Kinnear) and Thomas Mowbray (James Purefoy) leads to a duel... which is interrupted by King Richard II (Whishaw). Instead, the king banishes both men, and snatches the inheritance of Bolingbroke when his father (Patrick Stewart) finally dies. The nobles grow angry, and Bolingbroke begins to build a rebellion against his cousin -- with tragic results.

The story then skips about twenty years into the future for ""Henry IV."" King Henry IV (Irons) -- formerly Bolingbroke -- is troubled by brewing wars with Wales and Scotland, as well as the sudden rebellion of the fiery ""Hotspur"" Percy.

He's also not too happy with his son Hal (Hiddleston), who spends his time frolicking with thieves and pranksters, especially the corpulent Falstaff (Simon Russell Beale). When the Percys revolt against the king, Hal is given the opportunity to prove himself a worthy future king, and sets out to battle, with Falstaff beside him.

Finally, ""Henry V"" follows the new young king as he disarms assassination plots and prepares for the Battle of Agincourt. As he prepares to conquer France, Henry V grapples with his new responsibilities and seeks to find out what his men think of his rule. And he seeks to solidify his eventual victory by wooing a French princess.

""The Hollow Crown"" has the benefit of three directors -- Rupert Goold, Richard Eyre and Thea Sharrock -- and each one directs it in a way that befits the story. Goold's direction is elegant, with lots of soft white light and ornate details; Eyre's is harder and colder, with lots of period grime and slop; and Sharrock's is full of shadows, dirt and blood, but ends with elegance and light once again.

And the entire production has a feeling of respect -- you get the feeling that the people making it know and love Shakespeare's work, and wanted to present it in the best way possible. The sets are impeccable -- from shimmering forests to a grubby little tavern -- and they take the time to explore the comic (Hal doing an impression of his dad) as well as the tragic and dramatic.

As for the cast... they are all brilliant. There are seasoned veterans (Stewart, Irons, John Hurt, David Suchet) acting alongside relative newcomers. Whishaw plays Richard as a floating, effete king who likes cosplaying as Jesus and hanging out with his boyfriends, uncaring about how his kingdom is crumbling around him.

And Hiddleston gives a tour-de-force performance. His Hal is a mischievous, clever young prince who knows he will have to grow up soon, and Hiddleston plays him with equal skill as a prankster and a noble young king. He's easily holding his own among the veterans, while showing charisma enough to convincingly play a monarch.

Sadly Patrick Stewart and James Purefoy don't stick around long, although both of them do good jobs in the time they are there. Suchet gives a powerful late-in-the-game performance, Irons is excellent as a crotchety king who fears for his country's future, and Beale is quite good as the womanizing, boozing rogue Falstaff, who realizes that Hal will eventually cast him off.

""The Hollow Crown"" is a virtually flawless adaptation of Shakespeare's classic Henriad -- and if this can't get you interested in English history, nothing will.",1378944000,161,3787,4.966824644549763
5847899,5,B00DQN6IOK,"Richard II - 5 STARS.
Perfect acting, incredible story, gorgeous costumes, beautiful cinematography. By far the best of the four, and mostly because of an electrifying performance by Ben Whishaw (Cloud Atlas, Skyfall). I asked myself why I hadn't seen Whishaw more often! His performance as Richard II is towering, electrifying, chameleon-like, moving, disturbing, delicate, multi-faceted, and most of all, brilliant. A phenomenal performance, and worthy of much praise indeed.

The supporting cast more than holds it's own: Patrick Stewart (always great, but sadly he leaves the narrative rather early), Clemence Po&eacute;sy (a great, underrated French actress), David Suchet (reliable as ever), and Rory Kinnear (Who's Bolingbroke ""bursts with valour and courage"").

But let us give credit to where credit is due. Shakespeare...was one damn fine writer!

BEST SPEECH (delivered gloriously by Ben Whishaw):
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court...

...

Henry IV Part 1 - 4 STARS.
Jeremy Irons is one of the finest Shakespearean actors to ever live. His Henry IV is a sharp contrast to Whishaw's Richard. Richard is pious, noble, weak-hearted, and entirely eligible to be king. Henry is strong, prepared, diligent, hard, and a usurper. And there you see the problem. Richard was the rightful king, yet he was not a good ruler. Henry was a traitor, banished by Richard, yet it was he should sit on the throne of England. It was not until Henry's son - Prince Hal, would sit on the throne of England as Henry V, that England would have a ruler that was both ready and legitimate.

And as Prof. Peter Saccio (a renowned Shakespearean scholar) points out, overthrowing a king (as in what Henry IV did to Richard II) proves to others that a king can be overthrown. So it is with great certainty that Irons's Henry proclaims: ""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.""
...
Henry IV, Part 1 has a great cast, led by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons.
In the supporting cast we see: Tom Hiddleston (Mentored by Kenneth Branagh, Tom is an excellent actor, as adept at playing Loki as playing Prince Hal), Simon Russell Beale (a most excellent Falstaff - perfectly capturing Sir John's mix of charisma and loathsomeness), Julie Walters, and Joe Armstrong (a fine, impulsive Hotspur). On the whole, the cast is as well chosen, experienced, and star-studded as you could expect from a BBC Two Production produced by Sam Mendes (Skyfall).
...
So far so good, Henry IV, Part 1 has a stellar cast, luscious costumes, a battle scene or two, a heroic speech here and there...What's not to like?
I'll tell you - the lack of Jeremy Irons.
Yes, the Oscar winning actor has a very small screen time - the majority of the play given to raunchy tavern scenes, and political intrigue in Scotland. I saw disappointingly little of Irons in this adaptation, but on the whole, I loved it!

...

Henry IV Part 2 - 3 STARS.
Ian McEwan (Game of Thrones) co-stars in this one. Sadly, I didn't find this one at all as interesting as the previous wins.

...

Henry V - 5 STARS.
In my opinion, Henry V is the greatest play in the Henriad, and one of Shakespeare's greatest ever history plays (other greats would include Richard II, III, and Julius Caesar). There is quite simply, something for everybody here. Whether you love action, romance, political intrigue, drama, or historical fiction, you will love Henry V.

Perhaps one of the greatest things about Henry V is that it gives the title actor room to shine. And there have been many great portrayals of the warrior king, over the years. In film, there have been only 3:

1. Laurence Olivier, who starred and directed in a very famous 1944 adaptation of Henry V (The Criterion Collection). This film was released during WWII, and depicts the English as strong, valiant, heroic soldiers, and the French as pompous, foolish, and decadent.
Everything about this film was meant to boost morale during the darkest time during English history.
In short, it was thinly veiled British propaganda. And by Jove did it work. It was a serious morale booster.

2. Kenneth Branagh, who starred and directed in an acclaimed 1989 Henry V. The great Branagh's first film, Henry V co-featured a star-studded, immensely talented supporting cast. This striking, brilliant adaptation stripped away all the glamour and heroic-ness of Olivier's adaptation, and the end result was exciting, brilliantly acted, gritty, imaginative, and action packed.
Still the best.

3. Tom Hiddleston, who stars in a 2012 adaptation directed by Thea Sharrock, released by BBC. Hiddleston was younger than Olivier when he played Henry, but a year older than Branagh. The actor (fresh from playing the foolish, care-free Prince Hal) is surrounded by older players, so the end result is a Henry quite young, fresh from the death of his father, and forced to play a large role in the affairs of state.

But it's nothing less then compelling. I have always wondered how Henry the Fifth made the transition from Hal the playboy, the rascal, to Henry V, the warrior, the man. Tom Hiddleston manages the transition perfectly. His Henry is one charismatic, grave, and cerebral.
An excellent, fresh take on a classic play.
...
The film itself is well shot, and the action scenes are good. The supporting cast lacks the star factor, but none of the talent, of the previous films - with Julie Walters returning as Mistress Quickly, and John Hurt as Chorus.

However, Henry V suffers from a lack of visual grandeur. In Branagh's film, the King delivers the disturbing Harfleur speech from a rearing stallion, surrounded by fire and the carnage of battle. In The Hollow Crown, Hiddleston delivers the speech with equal gusto, but this time it is on a bridge, on the back of a complacent mount, with the fat mayor of Harfleur standing a few yards from him.
And what of the most famous speech in the play - perhaps of ANY Shakespeare play save Hamlet - the ""St. Crispin's Day"" Speech? Kenneth Branagh delivers it on the top of supply wagons, surrounded by a hundred soldiers, to a rousing Patrick Doyle score. When the Irish actor says, ""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,"" you feel like you are part of that small, noble band, led by that young, heroic king.
Tom Hiddleston speaks the immortal lines to just five men, standing on the ground, to no music at all. As I said before, the way he speaks those lines is worthy of praise, but the direction is not.

I could go on, but there is a huge difference from what you can do on a $9 million dollar budget, then on a $900,000 dollar budget. On the whole, I loved The Hollow Crown: Henry V, and greatly enjoyed watching it!
...
BEST SPEECH (Part of the St. Crispin's Day speech):
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remembered-
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition;
And gentlemen in England now-a-bed
Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

...
The Hollow Crown has been a triumph from the always great BBC. I cannot wait for more!
