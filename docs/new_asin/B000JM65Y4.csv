8325280,4,B000JM65Y4,"Since I brought my spinning bike I have bought many Dvds. Cy Yoga is the closest to a live class. the instructor is inspiring and down to earth.  The biggest plus to this workout is the music. Many exercise Dvds have some of the worst music. It's not the caliber of what can get in a live class but at least its strong energetic music to move too.  There are  two workouts  Fire and Ice very similar but different enough.  The yoga is basic but nice as a warm up.
All in all a good solid workout. something you can keep coming back too.",1289260800,,536,4.115384615384615
