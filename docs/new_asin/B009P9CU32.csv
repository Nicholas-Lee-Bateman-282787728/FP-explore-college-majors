5360398,5,B009P9CU32,"We're already fans of Signing Time so picked this up for our preschooler.  She LOVES it!  Even though there aren't as many signs (there still are SOME), this is a great introduction of weather concepts in a way children can understand.  Great music and my daughter loves seeing all the children dance.",1398643200,,301,4.75
5360399,4,B009P9CU32,"We have this one and the next two (Plants and Insects) and they've really grown on us in just the past couple of weeks. There's something so comforting and rewatchable about all of the Two Little Hands products. When I ask my 3yo what he wants to watch on TV, these days he always says ""Treeschool!""

At the moment he's singing ""Never give up! Never ever give up!"" from the spider song. I think the series is still finding it's footing a little bit, but I love the topics/theme educational songs, ""I Wonder"", ""Share It With a Friend"", the character/values stuff and the overall personality of the show. I'm skeptical about the game show segments and shoehorning reading instruction into every ep (rhyming, alphabet review) but overall, we dig this series and will support (Kickstarter) or buy outright the rest of the eps for both our actual preschool and the upcoming baby.

Thanks Avecedo-Coleman clan for producing more great educational TV we can all enjoy (and sing to) as a family.",1386028800,,987,4.766081871345029
5360400,5,B009P9CU32,"My children are 5, 3 and 10 months now.  My 5 year old is a long-time fan of the signing time series... but LOVED how this did not just focus on signing.  To her, it was a bonus.  She's into scientific concepts and weather is one of those things she was interested in, so this explained several concepts that she was extremely interested in.  My 3 year old is a harder sell and doesn't like the signing time series really but does love the music.  He also had a major phobia of thunderstorms and lightening.  When we watched this, the lightbulb clicked for him, and immediately when the next storm hit he started singing ""thunder's just a sound"" and was not scared anymore.  This really helped him understand that rain and thunder are alright.  The baby just loves all the music and singing her siblings do with it.  This has been a video that all of them love and enjoy.  Definite hit!",1383696000,,886,4.41358024691358
5360401,5,B009P9CU32,"Our son loves Rachel and has been watching this DVD non-stop since we got it. As soon as the next two are available, we are sure to buy!

*Note: This is not like the regular signing time DVD's, it still has some signs, lots of songs and my preschooler is learning and loving this DVD!",1383609600,,284,4.163636363636364
5360402,4,B009P9CU32,"The video is great. It is well organized and produced. The songs are great, as usual, and my daughter enjoys singing along and  at other times. I really LOVE the 'never give up' song, it is a great perspective of the bitsy spider. :)My only concession is that there are few signs, or new signs. Signing seems to have taken a back seat in this production. I wish it held an equal spot as the other signing time productions.",1368576000,,422,4.341772151898734
5360403,5,B009P9CU32,My daughteris close to three and it ia perfect for her. We have been fans of signinge for a while so this wasa great next step. Enjoyable music for kids and adults and educational for both as well!,1354060800,,197,4.2105263157894735
5360404,5,B009P9CU32,"We are so impressed with TreeSchoolers!  It is educational and fun.  Our kids love to watch it and we don't feel guilty about screen time.  My 4.5 year old and 2 year old both love TreeSchoolers and know all the songs.  Our favorite is Lightening & Thunder... they sing, ""Thunder is the sound that lightening makes, lightening leaves the cloud, headed for the ground, pushing air around, making booming sounds... boom, crash, crack, snap..."" They are singing these fun songs and learning at the same time.",1430265600,,505,4.837209302325581
5360405,5,B009P9CU32,"Rachel Coleman and her cast of cartoon characters & real friends sing and sign to bring children and educational programming together. This is a favorite of my 4 year old son, who has Down syndrome. I supported the Kickstarter campaign for this video, and it exceeded my expectations. My son loves to watch it!",1430265600,,310,4.7592592592592595
5360406,5,B009P9CU32,"Rachel has done it again! What has she done, you ask?
Saved my sanity.
My son has been watching SigningTime since he was born. Over and over and over and over.  This series is for a more mature (wink) connoisseur of preschool/early elementary entertainment. Don't worry... you will not be disappointed! I cannot rate this high enough!",1430265600,,334,4.859649122807017
5360407,5,B009P9CU32,"My four year old loves TreeSchoolers.  His favorite song is the thunder song on this episode  He will request watching and my two year old will enjoy it too.  Great songs you can listen to in the vehicle.

5360408,5,B009P9CU32,"As new parents we decided that we wanted to teach our daughter sign language from an early age.  That is how we found Two Little Hands production and their Baby Signing Time products.  As our daughter grew and developed we moved into their regular Signing Time products as well.  Since Two Little Hands Productions and Rachel have become a staple in our home, when I heard that they were launching a Kickstarter campaign for the Treeschoolers videos I was compelled to become one of their original backers even though my kids were too young for preschool videos.  My kids are now 16 months and 3 years old but the Treeschoolers videos are a favorite for both of them.  My 3 year old has learned how plants grow, how thunder and lightning are created, and the features that make an insect different from other animals.  These videos are not only very educational, but they make learning fun.  The characters are loveable, the songs are fun and will leave you and your kid singing them for days after you watched the video, and the content is presented in a way that helps kids learn the subject.  Being a proponent of teaching sign language to our kids, I have also been pleased that there is some sign language mixed into the lessons as well.
We have been backers for all of the Treeschooler campaigns and my kids both get excited when a new DVD shows up.  My three year old regularly bursts into songs from the show and my 16 month old gets excited when the videos come on and she claps her hands and dances around and signs more or again when the videos end.
You won't be disappointed with these videos content and your kids are sure to love them for years to come!  These are a valuable addition to your video library!",1430265600,,1721,4.487179487179487
5360409,5,B009P9CU32,"I've used the signing time products with my babies and it helped them to find their voice. So naturally when the kickstarter for Tree Schoolers came out I had to be part of it. And my boys (8 & 6) love these videos! This is their favorite one because they love the lightning and thunder song. They sing it all the time. I as a mom love to hear them singing all the things they've learned, and it doesn't stop there! After watching these videos my boys continued to ask more questions, so we'd look up the answers together. These preschool movies aren't just for the little ones, although my daughter (2) loves to dance along with her brothers and even tries to say the words to the songs as well, I know she's learning right along with them. I'm so glad I was able to be a part of bringing about these amazing videos!",1430265600,,817,4.27741935483871
5360410,5,B009P9CU32,My twin girls are 4 and LOVE these videos. The are fascinated with science and weather and are ahead of the curve when they talk about these things in school. They understand so much more then their peers on these subjects and I think it is only due to these DVDs. Thank you,1430265600,,274,4.188679245283019
5360411,5,B009P9CU32,"My three year old and 18 month old cannot get enough of Rachel and the Treeschoolers! I love it too and am constantly singing the songs, they are so catchy! Rachel Coleman and her team are brilliant in the way they have written and produced these shows. Not only do they feature fun characters, super cute kids, songs and american sign language, your child will actually LEARN something from watching - and you will too! I backed this project on Kickstarter and I am SO glad I did. Parents, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. You and your kids will be so happy you did!",1430265600,,572,4.355140186915888
5360412,5,B009P9CU32,"We have 4 Treeschoolers videos and plan to buy all of them!  This one is our favorite - not sure if it's the songs or the topic, but we watch them all the time!  We have 3 boys, our oldest being a 14 yo with severe CP, non-verbal, etc.  We began with Signing Time and have virtually all of the DVDs except the Baby Signing Time because the boys were older when they came out.  Our younger boys were signing before they used spoken words and our oldest understands ASL even though he cannot sign back.

This series is a wonderful addition to the library from Two Little Hands - the concepts, music, and ASL woven into each production are delightful, informative, and just plain fun.  We'd recommend them for anyone!  BTW, there is enough ""older"" content to keep older children engaged, even when they have seen it over and over again.  I find myself humming the songs periodically without the songs being ""stuck in your head"" all day.  LOL!

Check it out - you won't be disappointed!",1430265600,,982,4.466292134831461
5360413,5,B009P9CU32,My girls love the songs and concepts on this DVD.,1408752000,,49,4.0
8543556,4,B009P9CU32,"I love these videos, but this is the second one Ive ordered that has the DVD and CD not in its places. They are just rattling around the package. Luckily theres only one or two scratches, so it doesnt mess the discs up but for the price you pay for these movies, youd expect sturdier packaging.",1510272000,,294,4.267857142857143
8543557,5,B009P9CU32,My granddaughter is non verbal and she has learned so much from Signing time DVDs!,1482019200,,82,4.533333333333333
8543558,2,B009P9CU32,"I am really disappointed with how little signing Rachel does in this video. We were really expecting to see mostly signs, but she just uses a few signs (less than signing time).
I gave it two stars though because my daughter still loves it.",1450828800,,240,4.4772727272727275
8543559,5,B009P9CU32,"If you are looking for an entertaining, educational children's series with catchy songs, look no further.  Treeschoolers features endearing characters, integral lessons about kindness and compassion, and more.  If you are a fan of Baby Signing Time and Signing Time, you probably will not learn many new signs from this DVD, but Treeschoolers more than makes up for it in educational content and production value.  Hearing your preschooler sing about how lightning works or what a cloud is made of is adorable, and proves that Treeschoolers appeals to the way children learn.",1446854400,,575,5.228260869565218
8543560,5,B009P9CU32,"Three young ones under the age of 7. We significantly limit their screen time, but they get this (or Signing Time) every lunch hour.  They watch, learn and sing the songs from this (and all treeschooler DVDs) regularly. Highly recommend it.",1431216000,,240,4.853658536585366
8543561,5,B009P9CU32,"All the Rachel and the TreeSchoolers are awesome!  So educational and fun.  Who doesn't want their kid singing about how ""Thunder is the sound that lightning makes""",1431043200,,164,5.037037037037037
8543562,5,B009P9CU32,"My daughter, 4 1/2, absolutely loves this program and the whole series! It teaches science concepts in a simple concise way for little brains to soak up and has taught her to look at the world around her differently. Furthermore, I'm learning things from this series that I've obviously forgotten from science class. My daughter's favorite bit f the DVD is the rhyming song and she seriously impressed her teacher when they got to the rhyming unit at school and she already understood the concept and could find rhyming words. I cannot say enough good things about this series!!!",1430352000,,579,4.858585858585859
8543563,5,B009P9CU32,"TreeSchoolers are awesome! We've backed all of the TLH campaigns on Kickstarter. My 3 year old loves these shows. My 10 year old gets captivated by them too. My three teenagers have even been caught humming the tunes. I can't say enough about how educational and inspirational these shows are. We have loved and used all of TLH's productions for years. Signing Time helped us communicate better with our babies and toddlers, not to mention, it helped me learn to communicate better with my deaf neighbors. TreeSchoolers continues the Signing Time standard of excellence and gives pre-schoolers a chance to be inspired and educated while being entertained (not to mention they give Mom a chance to get a little guilt-free free time!). That's a win for everyone! This one is my absolute favorite! ""Tiny, tiny, tiny bits of ice..."" (What Makes a Cloud) is a hauntingly beautiful song. And I love that they weren't afraid to put it in a kids show!!! Who says kid song have to cheesy and annoying?

Since we live in Texas, the Lightning and Thunder song has come in handy more times than I can count during our storm season.

3 year old: ""Mama, what was that?!""
Me: ""Oh, that's just thunder.""
3 year old: ""Thunder is the sound that lightning makes.""
Me: ""That's right.""

No worries here! Thank you Rachel and TLH for making something truly beautiful and educational for our children. They deserve it.",1430265600,,1395,4.780082987551867
8543564,5,B009P9CU32,"Great Show! My son is 3 1/2 and he loves to watch the show ,and sing the songs. The plants and flowers episode is his favorite so far, but he likes to watch the others as well. He really retains the info that the show teaches about seeds and plants needing water and light to grow . He first watched this show before he turned three and he was singing the photosynthesis song..I wish I had videotaped that...so cute!!",1430265600,,417,4.291139240506329
8543565,5,B009P9CU32,"We LOVE Rachel and the TreeSchoolers.  We started watching when our daughter was 3 years old. She is now 4 and still loving all of the the TreeSchooler DVD's. Rachel is amazing and connects with the kids. Each of the animated characters are fun.  We are one of the original backers of this Kickstarter. For us, after the success of Baby Signing Time, Potty Time, and Signing Time, in our home, it was a no brainer to be a backer for Rachel and the TreeSchoolers! We are so thankful that Rachel and the gang decided that ""too educational for tv"" would not stop them from making a truly amazing show for kids who are ready to learn!",1430265600,,630,4.3760683760683765
