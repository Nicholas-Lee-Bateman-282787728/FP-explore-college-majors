7296320,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"I am a fallen-away Catholic. This is a most interesting topic. Although I have never stopped believing in God, I will listen to Barron because he's got my attention. I found Barron's website, WordOnFire.org. I highly recommend it to the General Public.",1443398400,,252,5.023809523809524
7296321,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"Fr. Barron is the man.  Loved the presentation and cinematography.  Fr. Barron's presentation came largely from his work on a ""Doctrine of God"" course taught to seminarians at Mundelein seminary.  Excellent for personal and group study!",1443398400,6,236,5.5
7296322,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"An excellent answer to the ""new Atheism""!  It will be appreciated by All Christians, not just Catholics.",1443398400,4,104,5.117647058823529

7296324,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Excellent!,1447286400,,10,10.0
7296325,4,B00ZYHNSVW,"""There are many views of God. Some see Him as a mythological figure; others as a distant first cause, a supreme being in the conventional sense. Some consider Him a threat to our freedom. But the True God is not one being among many, and he's not a competitor to our flourishing. God is that that which nothing greater can be thought, the strange and unique source of finite existence itself."" These are the opening words of Fr. Robert Barron's latest DVD study entitled, The Mystery of God. Judging by those opening words, I can tell that this study is going to be deep!

There are two DVDs, each with three lessons and a little over an hour in length. This makes each lesson approximately 20 to 25 minutes in length. This proves to be the perfect length for the depth of the material discussed. I personally have watched these lessons solo and in a small group, and in both settings, I found myself stopping the DVDs to pause, rewind, and re-listen to what was just said. The six lessons are as follows:

1. Atheism and What We Mean by ""God""
2. The Paths to God
3. The Divine Attributes
4. Providence and the Problem of Evil
5. Exploring the Trinity
6. The God Who is Love

The first lesson really sets the stage for the whole series as it elaborate on who God is/is not. Fr. Barron explains that the Incarnation is the chief distinctive doctrine of Christianity, and in the Incarnation we are supposed to find our true identity in God, and that God is not in competition with His creation. He then goes on to explain some of the different heresies concerning God including Nestorianism and monophysitism. He also talks about Ludwig Feuerbach and his influence on Karl Marx which ultimately influenced the New Atheists. What I really liked in this lesson was Fr. Barron contrasting God with the Greek gods. He tells us that when the Greek gods came down and got involved with human affairs, they wrecked humanity. When God involves Himself with humanity, he can do so without taking anything away from the creation He enters. This can be seen in the burning bush, and it can also be seen when He becomes a man, who is fully God and fully human.

Watching this video series was enlightening but at times overwhelming with knowledge. Fr. Barron pulls from ancient figures in theology, philosophy, and psychology like Aristotle and Augustine to more recent figures like Aquinas and Karl Rahner. He definitely showed off his knowledge and kept it at a mostly surface to shallow level, but in these deep waters, that too can be daunting. It is definitely not as approachable as his Catholicism series, not that that is a bad thing, as we need more challenging material to keep us growing and learning. I will end this review with some closing words on who this series is for. I have seen a lot of people say that this series is good for believers and non-believers, but I would disagree. People seem to be under the impression that if they give a non-believer this program, they will have to believe in God and renounce their atheism. That is not the case. It takes more than knowledge to believe in God. It takes humility to accept there is a God and that you are not the ultimate being in charge of your life. This series will help you stand your ground against the attacks of atheists, but it is not a conversion tool.",1447027200,,3318,4.552763819095477
7296326,5,B00ZYHNSVW,As always ~ thrilled with these products!,1447027200,,41,5.0
7296327,1,B00ZYHNSVW,"The first disc was faulty, please send me another and I will return the first, it skipped and was difficult to follow.  Thank you. If I get a replacement disc, then I can rate it, thank you",1445817600,,189,4.108108108108108
7296328,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"This series is great because Bishop Barron goes into much more depth than he is able to with his youtube videos. It's pretty dense material and I'm getting more out of it as I re-watch it. I do think Christians would enjoy this more than agnostics/atheists. I think the case Bishop Barron makes is very sound, but he begins mentioning the Bible from the very beginning, rather than starting with logic and building from there. He does get to logic and he is very logical when he gets there. I just wonder if non-believers would be turned off by that. My agnostic husband is thinking about watching this and if he does I will update with what he thinks.",1444435200,,652,4.487394957983193
7296329,4,B00ZYHNSVW,"I love Robert Barron's teaching but I give this 4 stars only because it is a little harder to understand and less grand than the Catholicism series. You have to leave some room for the really ""great"". That being said, The Mystery of God is deep and complex. I did find myself ""rewinding"" several times to fully understand what he said but of course this is the ultimate mystery so it should be a little hard to understand. If you are ""just curious"" I would start with the many videos on The Word of Fire website on various topics. If you are serious about understanding God then this is for you.",1444348800,,595,4.36936936936937
7296330,4,B00ZYHNSVW,As always Bishop Robert Barron does gives us wonderful insight and understanding to the Catholic Faith.,1444089600,,103,5.5
7296331,5,B00ZYHNSVW,So beautiful! As expected ... Thanks again Bishop Baron!,1443830400,,56,5.333333333333333
7296332,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Very easy to understand and respectfully done. We need more works like this that accurately and compassionately represent the faith.,1443484800,,132,5.65
7296333,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Amazing DVD!,1443484800,,12,5.5
7296334,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"I purchased both the DVD and accompanying study guide from the wonderful Word on Fire website. After just the first unit lesson, I was so pleased and surprised by how quickly I was able to comprehend and process his explanation of such a complex topic! He is an incredibly effective communicator, and this study is FUN!",1443484800,,319,4.714285714285714
7296335,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"This DVD series is bound to be a classic of our times. Bishop Barron systematically presents deep theological truths in a very digestible way. Not only does it answer questions that we have and satiate your heart, it also leaves you lingering for more! You'll find that you will desire for God increases. It's something to watch with a group and alone. I have watched it numerous times and still am able to pull out new things from what Bishop Barron is presenting. If you want to know who God is, and what the church/serious theologians mean by 'God' but you find you're unable to read theological giants such as; St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Bonaventure, or St. Augustine of Hippo this is for you!
I would encourage you to share these DVD's with believers and non-believers alike. There are great talking points!
I would challenge you to watch this with an open mind (not foregoing logic and right reason) and an open heart and not have your life be changed for the better.",1443398400,2,970,4.61271676300578
7296336,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Bishop Barron has such a wonderful command of language and relating theological concepts in everyday language.  I really like this series on the mystery of God.  It provides helpful insight into communicating our faith to others.  I highly recommend it and all of the other series by Bishop Barron.,1443398400,,298,5.040816326530612
7296337,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"I am a proud Catholic, yet I find it hard to verbalize my faith and make compelling advocations for my faith (the desire is there though). Bishop Barron took a very complex topic (what could be more complex and impossible to understand than God?) and makes  it easy to understand and vocalize to others. I truly enjoyed watching this, and value what I have learned! I cannot recommend this set more highly - if you're even thinking about getting this, please do!",1443398400,5,462,4.634146341463414
7296338,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"As always, Bishop Barron, you teach us well.",1443398400,,44,4.625
7296339,5,B00ZYHNSVW,I just love everything  Fr. Barron produces!  Always inspiring.,1443398400,,63,5.888888888888889
7296340,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"I am a youth minister for a Catholic, Franciscan conventual church. I am always hunting for meaningful resources to learn more about my faith and inform the work that I do with teens. What I am coming to find out is that I am a lover of philosophy and theology as well. I love contemplating the deep and profound things in life.

This film and study program has been the most worthwhile purchase I have made in this genre. Fr. Barron is one of the most well spoken speakers I have ever listened to. He shares about some of the most complex and thorough understandings that people have ever had about God, but he does it using language that is clear and concise. He introduces you to the thoughts of the world's greatest philosophers and theologians in a way that most will understand plainly. After all, these are very foundational concepts about God.

I highly recommend this film for anyone who questions their faith (which is healthy), is looking to learn more about their faith, or who wants to be able to articulate the things they have known. I watched this in two sittings and I am so excited to watch it again. The first time was for pleasure. This time I will take notes so I can share this with Catechists and students that I work with.

Thank you Bishop Barron and God bless you and your work.",1443398400,4,1304,4.447698744769874
7296341,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Beautiful movie!!! 5 stars no doubt!!,1443398400,,37,5.333333333333333
7296342,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"This film deserves all the raves.. It is  revealing and compelling. I learned a lot about the catholic faith and it left me wanting to know more. Educational and entertaining. I may purchased more and give as Christmas gifts etc. Should be in every catholic familys library.
Well done Father Barron!!!!! Bravo",1443398400,6,309,4.9423076923076925
7296343,5,B00ZYHNSVW,5 stars! An essential addition to library of the Christian scholar. This new series assists believer in becoming aligned with the Mystery of God and right worship.,1443398400,2,163,5.074074074074074
8721125,5,B00ZYHNSVW,great speaker,1528588800,,13,6.0
8721126,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"Bishop Barron's reflections on this Blu-ray set have helped me to understand and explore the abundantly rich Catechism of the Catholic Church.  Finally, there exists a realistic and hopeful antithesis to Eric Berne's writings:  Humility is Truth.  I probably needed to see this 30 years ago; even if I wasn't ready for it.  It's arrival is timely and its' message is urgent and profound.",1497139200,,387,5.0
8721127,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"only one downside: the price. I don't think I will buy many more unless they are more reasonably priced. That said, the teaching from Bishop Barron is wonderful. One other thing-the lighting. There was a light to the right of Bishop Barron that was very annoying and should have been picked-up by the photographer before the talks began.",1465948800,,337,4.827586206896552
8721128,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Great!!!!,1464998400,,9,9.0
8721129,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Excellent seies. I bought the study guide after beginning the series at Church. The second review of the series in conjunction with the study guide really deepened my understanding of the faith.,1461801600,3,194,5.09375
8721130,4,B00ZYHNSVW,"Bishop Robert Barron is a rising Catholic theologian and evangelist (yes, the Catholics have evangelists). I became aware of him through a talk he gave at Elmhurst College (a Mainline Protestant school - UCC) regarding his evangelization of the unchurched and formerly churched using YouTube.

I'm not a Catholic, rather a Mainline Protestant. I found all but one of the six parts useful and four of them rate five stars plus. So why am I so approving of the work of a Catholic theologian? At the 10,000 foot level, and even the 500 foot level, the Catholic and Mainline Protestant views of the nature of God are nearly identical. It's only down in the weeds where we differ. The only episode I did not find helpful was episode 2, where Barron goes deep into Aquinas' Five Proofs of God. This is of course based on the Aristotelian philosophy that the Reformation sought to remove from the Church (not to mention that several of the Five Proofs do not stand up to modern science).

The two best episodes, at least on my first pass through, are the  one on Atheism and the Nature of God, and the one on Evil. Also the one on the Trinity, so make it three best ones.

I might caution those who are Fundamentalists and some Evangelicals against this series, since your views on the nature of God can be quite different from Mainline Protestantism or Catholicism.",1460764800,,1359,4.626556016597511
8721131,5,B00ZYHNSVW,"Best done with small groups and Facilitator, like your pastor.",1457308800,,62,5.3
8721132,3,B00ZYHNSVW,"These videos are more in depth than others that I have watched.  I showed it to a group of 10 people and only a few could really grasp what he was saying.  He is a theologian and realize that some of us are still taking baby steps.  Also, they are all ""lectures"" not like his Catholicism dvds that had so much art and scenery along with his commentary.",1456790400,,352,4.147058823529412
8721133,5,B00ZYHNSVW,Anything with Dr. Barron is excellent and you can never go wrong,1448409600,,64,4.416666666666667
8721134,4,B00ZYHNSVW,"Fr. Barron did this video in a lecture setting, which was fine. But the cinematographer should have noticed the distraction of a lamp or light of some sort just to the right as you faced the priest. And it was always there through all the segments. Fr. Barron's videos on ""Catholicism"" were great in content and cinematography--superb even. So this was a bit of a let down. I can't believe the person filming did not notice that annoying lamp or light that made one want to look away from the screen. It distracted from the content Probably better off just listening to it with your eyes closed, which would reduce it to an audio recording. Okay, I've complained enough. Actual content good. We still love Bishop Barron and will always support him.",1448323200,,748,4.674242424242424
