8236734,5,B00104AYJW,"MY mom was very surprised to receive this DVD. She is from this era and remembers many of the old songs, dances, and seeing Katheryn Durnham in the movie Jivin in Be Bop.",1401494400,2,170,4.181818181818182
8236735,3,B00104AYJW,"The first movie in this set, JIVIN' IN BE-BOP, is a showcase for Dizzy Gillespie And His Orchestra, who play several numbers, including the classics ""Salt Peanuts"" and ""A Night In Tunisia.""  Also featured in the film, which is a faithful reproduction of a 1947 ""chitlin circuit"" variety show, are vocalist Helen Hume, dancers Ralph Brown, Ray Sneed, and Sahji, and comedian and co-host Freddie Carter.

The second feature, BEWARE, from 1946, has a thin plot about Ware College, which is facing closure due to loss of its endowment fund.  Louis Jordan And His Tympany Five (known mainly for songs such as ""Choo Choo Ch'Boogie"") do several good numbers, however.

Picture quality is average.  These are both low-budget ""race"" movies, and are not in high demand, so neither Alpha Video or anyone else is going to spend a lot of money on restoration.  We are lucky that these films exist at all.

JIVIN' IN BE-BOP: 4 stars
BEWARE: 3 stars

Averages out to 3.5 stars",1360627200,,961,4.781818181818182
8236736,3,B00104AYJW,"Jazz fans may salivate at the idea of this one. This juxtaposition of jivers Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Jordan sounds unbeatable-BUT.....

""Jivin in Bebop"" has no framing device (a'la ""Killer Diller"" or ""Boardinghouse Blues.""). This is a straight filmed vaudeville show with Diz emceeing with a rather unfunny comedy partner. Aisde from a few nice tunes and a still-sexy ""shake dancer"" (actually quite classy compared to the video rumpmistresses of today), nothing to write home about.

On the other hand, the super lunatic madman surpeme, sultan of saxophone and storytelling, and Grandfather of Soul Louis Thomas Jordan really shines in BEWARE! In what was one of the first films set on a black college campus, our man returns to his alma mater to save it from the clutches of a crooked president (the ""School Daze"" of the 1940s). Our man and his Tympani Five really jazz up the jokes and jive here, and if you could stand the wear on the print, you are in for a treat as Jordan & co. perform some really great renditions of their early hits. The dance number ""Long Legged Lizzie"" and the wild performance of the title song are almost wirth the price of admission alone! It would do well if the folsk at Alpha video would pair this with LJ's other filmed masterpiece LOOK OUT SISTER (1948-the film that inspired a young James Brown's direction in life). But that's available elsewhere.

With that said, enjoy the latter film and see the first one once or for Dizzy's performances.",1235606400,6,1481,4.77734375
