7417506,5,B014LLVHI2,"This was a really fabulous DVD.

Taiji ball is part of the traditional ""apparatus"" training of the old schools of Taijiquan.  Other internal martial methods have used weights, weighted vests, the Taiji Ruler, Plum flower posts, and weapons to develop internal power.

This beginner's DVD gives a brief intro to two of the methods of taiji ball training (using a small ball in each hand, or using a large ball held between both hands).  Each one develops the strength of the body in different ways, and is directly related to generating power for the taiji barehand sequence.

After I finished training with the DVD I was pleasantly fatigued in my shoulders, legs, and core.  It added a great strength workout to a relaxing and meditative style of movement!

This DVD does not have much theory on generating martial power or applications (like a previous reviewer noted), but I think it fulfills it's role as a beginner's workout splendidly.  David-Dorian Ross leads the exercise in a relaxing and cheerful manner, and it is simple to follow.",1446595200,10,1041,4.908571428571428
7417507,4,B014LLVHI2,"This wasn't what I expected.  It wasn't a video that was heavy on theory and detailed instruction.  Instead, it was a relaxed demonstration of how to incorporate Tai Chi Balls into your Tai Chi training.  It is less intense than Dr. Yang's Tai Chi ball training apps (and DVD's), and perhaps more practical because you are doing standard Tai Chi moves in a relaxed manner, promoting Qi flow, while building strength and stamina.

My experience with Tai Chi ball is that it does a wonderful job of strengthening your legs and core.

My guess is that the two approaches to tai chi ball training complement each other nicely.",1446249600,11,622,4.722222222222222

I purchased not only this DVD, but also Tai Chi Fit Flow and Strengtt, all of which have previews on YouTube showing people performing these Tai Chi workouts outdoors, BUT all of these workouts are filmed INDOORS!  I wanted a Tai Chi DVD filmed outdoors and I was totally deceived by the trailers and the photos on the back-cover.  I will never buy anything from Mr. Ross again!

I must confess that after almost a year of dealing with Tai Chi and being delighted more and more every week I first thought: Well ... balls ... let's wait until I understand how to move my hands, feet and the whole body kind of correctly before I even think of adding tools and toys to the movements. What a misconception! As this is meant to be a programme for beginners, you cannot start too early experiencing the benefit of ""focussing on an external object"" while you follow the movements performed by David-Dorian Ross. To this day I have only used the first two workout parts of the programme. The bare hand part offers simple, easy to follow movements that are great for getting familiar with what is called ""The state of flow"". In the chapter that introduces the two small balls (you can already have fun before finding the presented wooden balls or spheres: use oranges or grapefruits, that's what I started with and it felt amazing) the repertoire of movements becomes slightly adapted to this ""holding the balls situation"", which differentiates it a little bit from the first part and demands some new attention of the beginner.
I will eventually proceed to the next part, introducing the single but much bigger and heavier ball and this review will be completed then.
Regarding the two thirds I already have accomplished I really appreciate this DVD and recommend it to everybody, who just started to get interested in Tai Chi and wants to find an encouraging instructor who really knows how to share his obvious enthusiasm for what he's presenting.",1454976000,2,1627,4.773049645390071
7417549,5,B014LLVHI2,"Let this DVD and David-Dorian Ross introduce you to the beautiful rhythm and flow of Tai Chi Ch'uan.  Or if you are already an established Tai Chi Ch'uan student, use these workouts to naturally refine your body shapes, rediscover the beauty of this art form or lighten up your practice.  Although the weighted ball intensifies the workout, the tone of this program is lighthearted and as Ross explains, Tai Chi Ch'uan is meant to be played. The open setting, clear camera views and repetition of classic moves provide a perfect excuse to get into your body and free up your mind.

In the 25 years I've known David-Dorian Ross, I've watched him continually find more and more effective ways to share Tai Chi Ch'uan with his followers.  The format he shares here, in both free hand and weighted ball, is at once both simple and inclusive of the fundamentals.  All you have to do is show up and play!

7417550,5,B014LLVHI2,"This product was provided to me free of charge by the publisher. David-Dorian Ross gives with Tai Chi Ball Workout for Beginners a great tool to work on diverse aspects of ones Tai Chi. David-Dorian Ross created three workouts which build upon each other. In the first workout he starts with the basic stance (bows step)and then introduces each movement with a short but precise and plain explanation: sinking the qi, open the door, push/pull, parting horses mane, grasp birds tail, crane spreads wings and needle at the sea bottom. I liked the immediate and multiple repetitions of each single movement which makes it easier to get it in ones system and finally to get the combination flowing. In the second workout two small balls are added to the same routine with just a few new movements (princess on the mountain, princess in the valley, deflect down and parry). Certainly David-Dorian Ross does not forget to explain how to hold the balls. I especially enjoyed the Qi Gong movement Princess on the mountain/in the valley. It goes very well with the balls and opens up the ribcage. During the third workout with the big ball to the similar routine please note that the ball increases its weight constantly! Again the holding of the ball is explained. The two new movements (vertical circle, horizontal circle) go very well with the big ball. This last workout made me feel my whole body and when David-Dorian Ross occasionally reminded me to stay relaxed, I forced a smile.
I thought that I was not really a fan of Tai Chi with tools but I can see now how these tools can help me to get a better understanding and a faster access to the employed technique empty handed. Especially the big ball made me look at my posture by letting me feel my weak spots. The usage of the weighted balls certainly helps to build up strength and stamina but furthermore it helps to play and shape the Qi outside ones body. Although this is mainly a workout course, I admire how effortless David-Dorian Ross breaks down every movement with his plain explanations. Even this is all recorded, I had the feeling that he addressed me in person and that he kept an intense and constant connection with me during the workouts. Great workouts for the ones walking on the Tai Chi path.",1451952000,5,2264,4.676691729323308
7417551,5,B014LLVHI2,"Firstly, full disclosure I am a huge David Dorian Ross fan. I was ever since I stumbled across him while looking for some traditional tai chi and came upon the Great Courses - Essentials of Tai Chi and Qigong.  I re-learned the Yang 24 Step in less than 2 weeks!!!

There's a saying 'there are no bad students just bad teachers.'  And when it comes to Tai Chi they don't come much better than this guy.
Tai Chi Ball Workout for Beginners isn't the traditional tai chi form. It is based on the TaijiFit Flow and Mindfulness that David Dorian Ross has created to shape a tai ji movement that all can follow regardless of tenure, skill, or experience.

In this video David Dorian Ross takes us step by step through a set routine (knowing that we become best at the things we practice the most) 1st with no ball, 2nd with a ball in each hand and then 3rd a little harder with one weighted ball.

If you follow just this simple routine day in and day out for less than 30mins I guarantee you will feel revitalized and  ready to take on new challenges life presents to you.

I hope you enjoy this DVD if not I am keen to understand why thanks",1451606400,5,1136,4.255813953488372
7417552,5,B014LLVHI2,"I have heard numerous myths in regards to Tai Chi. The two I hear most often is: Tai Chi? Thats for old people, or Tai Chi is not really exercise.  If this is your opinion of tai Chi, Tai Chi Ball Workout for Beginners by David-Dorian Ross will change all that.
The first set of empty hand practices are deceptively simple, but are in fact, very powerful. David-Dorian uses a gentle conversational manner to guide the student through each of the movements. The movements are fluid and easy to follow, and by the time you are finished with the workout, you will know it.
One of the things I appreciate about the DVD is the close attention the camera person paid to close ups of the instructors hands and feet. In Grasping the birds Tail, for example, you can clearly see exactly how David-Dorians hands are positioned to create that move.
The second set of practices involve the weighted chi balls but if you don't have those, soup cans work just as well. This practice is a tad more intense, and does a great job of working the arms and core. Again, David-Dorian does a wonderful job of explaining each technique in detail in a manner that anyone can understand.
The third set of practices will leave the nay sayers who think Tai Chi cant be a real workout changing their minds. Using one large weighted ball, David-Dorian instructs the students in each movement. The movements flow beautifully, are challenging but not impossible. If done correctly, youll sweat.  Its a great upper body, arm and core workout.
The setting for the DVD is simply beautiful, the music is soft and does not overpower the speaker. Instructions are easy to follow and the way David-Dorian talks as he is demonstrates the workout makes you feel as if you are in the room with him. Its simply a lovely video and it flows so well. I highly recommend it.",1451606400,16,1828,4.587155963302752
7417553,5,B014LLVHI2,"Thank you David-Dorian Ross!
Simple and powerful, these graceful, fluid movements are wonderful Tai Chi routines, easily accessible and fun to perform. No memorization is needed. Mr. Ross cheerfully leads you through each movement, allowing you to relax, let go, and enjoy the flow. Its hard to believe you're getting a workout because the routines are so great for de-stressing too.

Simple, yet elegant, each of the three routines introduces more of Tai Chis magic. With plain, easy to understand language, Mr. Ross makes playing with Tai Chi and its energy a real pleasure. In addition to the Tai Chi Ball routines, which are wonderful, theres an entire empty hand Yang-style routine to play along with. Its great that all the routines are performed on both the left and right side, so there are no mirror image issues, making the DVD even easier to use.

Just when you think youve experienced all the fun playing Tai Chi, David-Dorian Ross gives you another little gift, introducing an idea, concept, or principle that makes these workouts even more delicious. Im still discovering new golden nuggets each time I use the DVD.
A true Master of Flow, Mr. Rosss smooth and liquid-like movements are not only fun, but also relaxing and energizing at the same time. I highly recommend his clear and easy to understand program for both beginners and advanced Tai Chi players alike.

7417554,4,B014LLVHI2,"First, a bit of my background: My 10+ years of martial arts training includes three years of Yang style Tai Chi study, which included learning a 24 movement form and a 108 movement form.  Prior to this video, I had not used Tai Chi ball training, but I had some experience with holding bricks while performing Ba Gua (Pa Kwa) forms under a different Sifu (20+ years of military service moves a person around a bit).  I first encountered Sifu Ross because of his selection as a professor at The Great Courses Academyhe developed a course that teaches the Tai Chi 24 movement form, Chi Gong exercises, and more.  Since I enjoyed his video lessons, and I had used hand weights in Ba Gua, I wanted to see what the fusion of Sifu Rosss style of teaching and Tai Chi weighted ball training would be

This is a rewarding experience of training sessions--for beginners, as well as those of us with a bit of experience.

The first of the three sessions in the video is a set of hands-only Tai Chi Moves.  It is comfortably simple in its presentationyou can mirror what Sifu Ross is doing on your screen because he performs the basic movements one at a time, multiple times in a row.  You are NOT required to memorize a bunch of moves that must be performed in a pre-determined sequence.  The presentation allows you to develop a flow that warms your body

The next training session is performed with two wood balls, which are about the size your one hand closed in a fist with your other hand covering itin other words, something that is comfortably larger than your hand, allows your fingers and palm to keep a nice circular shape, and yet can be held in your hand in loose, non-stressed grip.  Sifu Ross uses the same basic movements from the first training session in the second session, so once again it is a warming, flowing session (around 20 minutes).  Since I did not possess wooden training spheres at home (they are available on the internet), I used a set of weighted training strength balls that were three pounds eachthree pounds in each sphere was borderline too heavy as I found myself near the end of the session not quite extending my arms as far as the would have extended if they were empty-handed (never straight or locked out arms in Tai Chi!  but my arms were under-extended by the end of the session).

little bonuses appear in the first and second session that I had not encountered in my earlier Tai Chi forms trainings, such as when Sifu Ross integrates heres where an elbow appears and heres a shoulder bump within the movements

The final training session is performed with a single, larger wooden ball.  Based upon an internet search for Tai Chi balls, I saw that they range from approximately five to eight pounds in weight.  I happen to own 3, 5, and 8-lb training sphere sets from other Ba Gua training, so I tried the 8-lb ball and found it a bit too heavy by the end, whereas the 5-lb sphere was light enough, and perhaps I will seek out a 6-lb or 7-lb sphere.

This was an interesting, mind-and-body expending experience that results in warming strength.  Once you have the basic moves down, you can go deeper with your training and this video by self-monitoring /self-awareness of your balance within each move (Do I feel stable as I shift this external weight? Do I need to sink down a bit? Are my elbows reasonably over my knees? etc.) .4+ stars out of 5...",1451174400,38,3386,4.522950819672131

I've been using this workout 3-6 times a week for about four months and, coupled with another qigoing sequence, have noticed improvements in my overall health, back, and legs.

I'm a bit older and have some physical problems.  One good thing about these workouts is that when you take this at the right pace (easy), you should get results and not aggravate anything.  I think you can do this everyday or a few times a week and get some benefits.

Usually, narrations get on my nerves.  I can watch and run this over and over and Ross' narration settles well with me.

One warning.  If you want to go to the one ball exercises and have shoulder/upper back problems, I found it better to start with a lighter ball (I just used a volley ball) to get your body acclimated to the movement.  Them, the heavier balls become more useful.  Again, start light and easy.",1497657600,2,999,4.464088397790055
