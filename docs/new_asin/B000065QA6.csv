7961270,3,B000065QA6,"The Inspector General - Kaye plays a drifter who wanders into a town with a thoroughly corrupt city government and is mistaken for the ""Inspector General"" sent by Napoleon to clean up corrupt politicians. Danny Kaye is very funny in a goofy slapstick kind of way, and the mistaken identity is milked for every laugh it's worth. This is a good one and both the audio and video are in good shape. This film is black and white despite the color poster shown on the box.
The Medicine Man - Jack Benny plays a dishonest ""doctor"" of a medicine show who falls in love with a storekeeper's daughter just as her abusive father decides to marry her off to a wealthy older man. This is a pretty good movie, though I found the romance a little shallow and unbelievable. The thing is... it is *not* a comedy. It stars Jack Benny and I guess that's why it's on this disk, but he isn't trying for laughs in this film. The audio and video are both good quality.
The Road to Hollywood - This is a documentary on the rise to fame of Bing Crosby. This isn't a very good documentary. I learned very little about Bing's life, and the narrator was not a good speaker. He kept staring at nothing in particular and talking in a monotone. Most of the film is composed of clips from various movies with Bing Crosby that generally relate to something the narrator is saying, and some of the clips were cute. The thing I found most frustrating about this feature was the audio level. It fluctuated so much between clips and between the narrator and the clips that I spent most of the time with my remote in hand either turning down blaring music or turning up a conversation. This one is also black and white despite the color movie poster shown on the box.",1037059200,11,1729,4.389408099688474
