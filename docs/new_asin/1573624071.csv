192480,1,1573624071,"Review of Leprechaun
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Leprechaun was one of those awful, campy horror movies from the 1990s that everyone saw and no one wants to see again. It spawned a chain of even worse sequels; the original is really only memorable because it starred a pre-FRIENDS Jennifer Aniston. No one who saw this movie would have guessed the brunette barely-pretty teenager would become the most popular actress in America.

I guess if you really want to see her before her glory days, you can rent this one. Or if watching really cheesy horror movies during Halloween is your thing. Other than that, its definitely one of those movies you can get away with pretending to have seen by just rolling your eyes at the mention of it.

If you do like the Leprechaun franchise, there's a quadruple feature on Amazon for your enjoyment on Halloween or St. Patty's.",1497225600,,866,4.684210526315789

7 you ask? Yes, even with #5 and 6 (which were Racists Mistakes in my opinion).
And then the Final Nail in the Coffin, was when WWF decided to try their hand at Filmmaking, and made a supposedly 7th sequel.

So, in movie 1, we're in North Dakota. In #2, we goto Los Angeles.
#3 finds us in Las Vegas. And #4 we're in the FUTURE, and in SPACE.

So the big mistake, was when the Leprechaun finds himself SOMEHOW in the past, and in the Hood (of all places).
This is the point at-which you realize, that the Studio just inst taking their creation seriously anymore.
And to make matters worst, they made a SEQUEL to this particular bad movie, with ""Leprechaun: Back to Tha Hood 2"".

But hey, for $20-some bucks, you can throw away the last 2 discs, and just keep the Good ones.

Video Quality is Actually 1920x1080. No black bars lining the screen anywhere.

192546,5,1573624071,"The 'Leprechaun' series is one of those sets of movies that inspire either love or hate - for the most part there's little middle ground.  I myself love them; in fact I've seen the first one twice in the theater.  Warwick Davis brings the title character to life (in the first 6 films; not in the reboot ""Origins"", which is not a bad thing considering how awful that last film is).  Davis is the main thread throughout and brings the tales together even though there are continuity issues between the films (such as the leprechaun's powers and abilities).  His whimsical take on what could have been a flat character makes the movies work.

This blu-ray set is excellent, and completely blows away previous versions in terms of detail and sound.  The films employ a beautiful wide-screen transfer that is not marred by over use of digital tools and noise reduction, giving the picture a nice sharpness without going overboard.  The extras are a real treat, something which most movie studios would never give to a low-budget film series.  Kudos to Lionsgate for caring enough to do all this for the fans instead of the usual bare-bones, iffy transfers most second-tier films get from major studios.

One small thing I've noticed in every home video release of the first 'Leprechaun' film:  Like I said I saw this twice on the big screen, and there is one line that was said differently.  On all home releases, when the Leprechaun is running out of the barn he pulls Nathan's injured leg from underneath him, and growls an angry ""How's you're leg?"" as he does so.  In both theater version I saw the line is the same but said very differently:  Instead of angry, the Leprechaun's tone is lilting, adding a comic edge to it.  He says it in a whimsical tone that had the audience I saw it with burst into a round of laughter.  In 1993 not all theaters were rigged for full stereo sound.  Perhaps the print I saw was a mono mix?  The reason I mention it is because I always liked the theatrical version of that line better and have been bummed it seems to be lost, as its not on the blu-ray either.

Still I'd highly recommend this set to fans.  The package is slim and convenient, holding all 7 films in a case no bigger than those for a single disc.  The discs also stay in the holders so they're not slipping about getting scratched up.  A-plus all around for this set!",1476489600,2,2367,4.522352941176471

Each movie also has a nice 'making of' documentary attached as well as a few other little goodies. The picture quality is superb, and it was great finally seeing the original in widescreen.

Personally, I could care less that they included Leprechaun: Origins in this set. It belongs there to have a sense of completion, but that movie is really the worst of the series. Say what you want about Leprechaun in Space, at least that movie was fun.

192574,3,1573624071,"Released in 1993, Leprechaun is a low-budget horror/comedy about a father and daughter (John Sanderford & Jennifer Aniston) who move to a small, old house in North Dakota where they and some painters (Ken Olandt, Mark Holton & Robert Hy Gorman) encounter a devilish little leprechaun obsessed with his pot of gold coins (Warwick Davis).

Ive only seen the first four Leprechaun movies and this is easily the least of em. While the cast, locations and leprechaun are good theres only enough material here for half the movies runtime, like maybe 45 minutes. The second half goes on and on with the leprechauns zany antics and attacks on the cast. Being low-budget, the location is limited to the ranch house and a couple of visits into town, such as the hospital and diner. It just gets monotonous and theres simply not enough to keep the viewers interest. The next three movies make up for this by changing the location and upping the ante with the entertainment on all fronts. Leprechaun is worth seeing, particularly to catch a glimpse of young Jennifer in her first theatrical movie, but its humdrum after the first 40-45 minutes and nothing exceptional up to that point.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Saugus, California, near Santa Clarita.

192579,4,1573624071,"Having recently suffered through the seemingly completely unrelated and failed reboot Leprechaun: Origins (2014), I felt the need to go back and revisit this old clutch favorite.

This classic bad horror movie opens with such a pleasantly bad 90s feel as, in the very first scene mind you, we meet our Leprechaun (Warwick Davis; Willow, the Harry Potter series) coveting his pot of gold and gleefully chanting murderous limericks about those who would steal from him, all the while wearing the classic Leprechaun trappings of gold-buckled shoes and a hatted green suit.  Like an R-rated children's show, he narrates his malevolent intentions and giggles and scurries around, often toying with his victims.

Cut to more comical 90s badness, an Irishman polishes off an entire bottle of Irish whiskey before drunkenly brandishing some stolen gold before his doubtful wife.  Can anyone guess who the Leprechaun's first victims will be???  The bad-o-meter starts reading pretty high when the drunkard brandishes a four-leaf clover to rebuke the mythological creature much as an old priest and a young priest would to ward off the demon Pazuzu.

All this fun, bad, awesomeness transpires in the first 10 minutes, so right off the bat I'm going to recommend this to anyone who enjoys some bad 80s or 90s horror.  But on with the review!

Our clich Valley girl Tory (Jennifer Aniston; Horrible Bosses) is reluctantly visiting her father (John Sanderford; Firestarter, The Alchemist) for the summer at his South Dakota home where the drunk Irishman had imprisoned the Leprechaun years ago in the basement.  Helping to renovate the house is a simple-minded manchild (Mark Holton; Teen Wolf) with a penchant for telling unbelievable tall tales.  So naturally, when he sees the evil leprechaun no one believes him.

The acting and writing aren't good, but they aren't unforgivably awful either.  In fact, I find the lines to be quite entertaining most of the time.  But what really makes this movie work is the over-the-top performance of Warwick Davis as the monster of folklore.  He maniacally laughs and does ridiculous things like death by pogo-stick, speeding in a kid's Powerwheels car, and compulsively shining dirty shoes.  Adding to the haphazard badness is that he can magically teleport, but he never seems to use it in useful ways.  Instead he chases people, regular-sized people, and somehow keeps up with them with those stumpy little legs.

The special effects are just okay in general, but the finale when they defeat the Leprechaun is deliciously slimy, gooey fun.  There's not a moment of scary in this movie, but giggles galore.  This toes the line of a horror comedy.

Let's be clear.  This movie is stupid.  But it's the kind of stupid that's awesomeif you're into that kind of thing.  And, by the way, this was Jennifer Aniston's first lead role in a theatrical release movie!  So watch it!  Then watch a couple sequels!",1459123200,4,2931,5.031120331950207

192714,5,1573624071,"I'm giving this 5 stars based on what it is - not as a review of the movies.

I LOVE the Leprechaun series despite some of the ridiculous acting, plots, and that the Leprechaun isn't really consistent throughout the series. In all honesty the original Leprechaun is what makes me love the series. I've had the Pot of Gore DVD set since it was released, but I've since boxed up all my DVDs and find it not really worth digging them out when I get the urge to watch one of them. So when they released the entire set on Blu-ray it was a no-brainer for me to purchase.

I was a bit confused at first when I offered the entire set for such a relatively low price, I thought it was a mistake and it was only a Blu-ray release of the original. The fact you can get all of them on for such a good price is worth it, even if you only really like one or two of the films.

The special features are what you'd expect from a series like this. The only thing I was disappointed with is the length of each Behind the Scenes featurette that accompanies each film, but it's better than nothing.

As for the seventh ""installment"" being included, I really couldn't care less about it. For me it's the equivalent of buying the six Leprechaun movies that feature Warwick Davis and getting some abstract sticker that says ""Leprechaun"" on it. It's a bonus that not many fans of the original films will care about and probably the only way they can say the movie made any money.",1416268800,,1455,4.260869565217392

Horror films were exciting around the late 80's and early 90's. Studios did what they could to introduce audiences to folkloric villains like the Lep, and I was hooked!

This Blu-ray set WOWED ME on how beautiful it looks on screen, clean, can see all the details and the lighting is terrific. Way better resolution than how I used to watch the earlier ones back then on VHS.

The only one I saw in theaters was Leprechaun 2, which I'm happy I did. Own this edition, you won't be disappointed. Warwick Davis gives a good commentary and gives tidbits on each of the films he starred in!",1415577600,,757,4.4

192728,3,1573624071,"It took me twenty years after this came out before I actually sat down to watch the whole thing through. While I can't say it was worth the wait, it IS a fun way to spend an evening. I mean fun, because the horror is just a misnomer. The movie is about as horrific as a root canal. But that goes without saying, it's a real hoot watching Warwick Davis having a blast in this movie. And he IS having a blast. Despite the high heel shoes, the makeup, and the awful costume, he's enjoying himself.

I won't go into specifics. All you need to know is that some fool got his hands on the pot o' gold belonging to a sadistic leprechaun. So what if he's got bad taste in clothes? Next thing you know, the old adage of ""Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers"" takes on a whole new meaning. After the thief is summarily punished, the leprechaun is locked away for years until Jennifer Aniston and her pappy come a callin'.

I don't know why she's on the DVD cover. She's okay in the film. But she does her best impersonation of a big city airhead and that's all. She whines, screams, pouts, whines some more. Mind you, this is before 1994, so I guess I can cut her some slack. Later, she meets up with the local handyman, his brother and friend and things go quickly downhill from there.

The boys get their hands on some gold, the leprechaun escapes his prison, and all heck breaks loose when he wants ALL his gold back. Oops! The other handyman dude swallowed a piece. Uh-oh! I'm assuming a laxative just won't cut it. The leprechaun is played by a scene-guzzling Warwick Davis who wrecks havoc on anyone and anything who stands in his way of getting his gold back.

Spiteful glee doesn't even begin to cover the laugh Davis dispenses as he's poking his way through a guy's chest with a pogo stick. Our hapless foursome discovers a four-leaf clover might be the way to thrash the little creep.

Three stars for Warwick Davis having the time of his life, Jennifer Aniston in her L.A. Gear sneakers,(I had a blue pair), and overall a comedic horrorfest that should have been shown on TNT's Monstervision.

A side note: I wouldn't pay full price for this. Get it used or record when it comes on cable.",1414281600,2,2184,4.393564356435643

192740,4,1573624071,"An ancient Leprechaun who goes on a terror spree after his bag of gold coins is stolen. This film should be not in the horror section but in the comedy; every line utter by Davis in his faux-angry Irish accent makes me bust out laughing. Leprechaun is not a movie that is to be taken all that seriously. The movie has some scenes that obviously were intentionally comedic, such as the Leprechauns many modes of transport, which include a tricycle, a child's motorized car, a customized go-kart and rollerskates.

The acting is of a better quality than a movie about a killer Leprechaun deserves. Warwick Davis, in his first lead villainous role, is clearly having a riot as the Leprechaun, Jennifer Anniston is good enough as Tory and Ken Olandt is pretty likeable as Nathan. Ozzie and Alex did get slightly annoying, but not enough to warrant a full-blown complaint about it.

The movie is still pretty gory, and some scenes are actually genuinely creepy. The special effects are actually quite good, with the Leprechaun looking nasty and the gore can be horrific.

The cast is filled out by one of the first performances by Jennifer Aniston and a bunch of ""B"" actors who essentially act as foils in the Leprechaun's quest. This is one of the movies I usually watch in celebration of St Patrick's Day -- along with The Quiet Man and The Fighting 69th -- but what it has in common with those I have no idea other than it was a good film.",1413676800,2,1437,4.583657587548638

The audio track has been downgraded to 2.0. It's the only movie in the original series that had a 5.1 track on DVD. It's unfortunate that it wasn't used here, because the picture on all the movies looks great in HD. Also, if you're questioning the ""forced"" widescreen aspect ratio of a couple of the movies that were originally full screen on DVD, take a look at the imdb pages for the movies--most of them were actually shot to be in widescreen format, which probably means to release them on DVD in full frame, they simply removed the matted format instead of hacking off the sides of the widescreen version, which would have given you even less of the film's picture.",1413331200,,849,4.592105263157895

192752,4,1573624071,"You may want to hang on to your DVD copies of Leprechaun 1, 3, and 4, the reason being that they have been cropped in this release.

This means that since the films were shot in a square format to fit old TVs, now the top and bottom of the image has been sliced off to make it fit rectangular HDTVs.

Sometimes a film is shot ""open matte"" where the top and bottom of the image are always intended for removal for movie theaters.  I don't know if that is the case with these movies.  I just know that you see more of the image on the old DVD releases.

That being said, this issue does not affect Leprechaun 2, 5, 6, or 7.  They were all originally shot widescreen.  And all the movies look and sound great on Blu-ray.  Lots of extra goodies too.  I only wish we had a choice of to crop or not to crop.",1412380800,5,801,3.9874213836477987

192756,5,1573624071,"The long running, fun but often scoffed at Leprechaun series makes its blu-ray debut in style courtesy of the fine people at Lionsgate.  This collection gathers together Leprechaun (1993), Leprechaun 2 (1994), Leprechaun 3 (1995), Leprechaun 4: In Space (1997), Leprechaun: In the Hood (2000), Leprechaun: Back 2 Tha Hood (2003) and the horrible reboot Leprechaun: Origins (2014). The newest film is being sold seperately but I honestly don't know why people would go for that when you can instead get the entire series in high definition for about only 10 dollars more. The first 6 films are put on two at a time on the first 3 discs with Origins getting the 4th disc all by itself.
Each film is presented in its original widescreen aspect ratios with lossless sound. What I was most pleasantly surprised with was the amount of high quality extras that were given to each film. Lionsgate could have easily just gone with a barebones release but the amount of love that was given to this series is something that I didn't expect. The special features are as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Picture quality is excellent with no compression issues to be found at all on the first 3 discs especially since there are two films on each of those dual layer blu-rays.  They also maintain a very high bit rate too. Colors and textures are quite strong and it appears that no digital scrubbing was done at all as there is a nice layer of film grain present on the first 6 films. Check out that very cute blue dress that Jennifer Aniston is wearing near the beginning of the first film. The reboot Origins appears to have been shot digitally. The making of features on each film runs from 21 to 29 minutes and are quite informative and in depth. Red Shirt productions' Michael Felsher oversaw the making of material and anybody familiar with his work knows that he always delivers the goods and does his usual exemplary work here too. While some people hate this series, I always enjoyed it for what it was as the films were made to just be fun and not be taken seriously at all. However, I do need to state that the reboot Origins is almost unwatchable and a terrible film. They didn't even got star Warwick Davis back in the title role! But most people like myself are buying this collection for the first 6 (or first 4 in some friends of mine's cases) anyway and with most places selling this collection for only 29.99, it's a steal value wise especially considering the breadth and quality of the extras afforded each entry.

I never thought that I would be calling the Leprechaun Complete Movie Collection one of the best blu-ray releases of the year, but there you go. Fans will rejoice having all of the films finally in glorious 1080p and while the reboot is atrocious, its inclusion does make this the complete definitive Leprechaun collection.

It's as basic a storyline as you can get. Don't steal a leprechauns' gold, if you do they get upset and try and kill you. Add to that a hunky handyman for Jen and some slapstick  painters for comedic relief and there you have it. You can fill in the blanks any way you want, it doesn't really matter, the movie is a showcase for Jen and her legs and her pre-operation nose.

192782,2,1573624071,"The movie opens with Daniel O'Grady, a greedy and senseless man, stealing a pot of leprechaun's gold and locking the little critter in a crate. His wife falls for the old hallucination trick and fall down the strairs; enraged, O'Grady curses the leprechaun and knows he can' t trust the word of the devious bastard. He has a stroke, and his part ends.

 Ten years later Tori (Jennifer Aniston) and her father move into an old house out in the boons. The day they arrive three house painters come quickly to fix the place up. Ozzie, a not so bright big-build goon, a little kid with more brains that all the adults put together named Alex, and the hunk Nathan. The acting is good enough from all of them.

 Ozzie ends up letting the leprechaun out (we could have seen that a mile away); he and the little kid stupidly swipe some of the gold coins. Can't people have enough sense to leave the little guys stash alone?? Big mistake. The leprechaun wants all 100 pieces back and damn anyone who touches any of it.

 A movie about a genuinely eerie leprechaun would have worked better but we have what was have and it's pretty fun. The leprechaun basically goes around trying to reclaim his gold and kill people in cheesy, silly ways in the meantime. Some of the slayings are pretty inventive and it's clear from the start the creature is a sadistic half-pint who enjoys the pain of others. They have a subplot of him having an obsession with clean shoes. Throwing the shoes at him (dirty ones at that) to distract so they could get away is just one example of the movies corniness. At times they did go a bit over the top and ended up more ludicrous than anything but the finished result is a campy, amusing way to spend a short amount of time.

 The Leprechaun himself is spectacular. Warwick Davis for born this role, and the makeup is convincing. You mean he's not really a leprechaun??? He acts the way a mean leprechaun should and I enjoyed the performance.

 What bugs me was the ending. Is it that easy to find 4 leaf clovers? Yeah, I just happen to have those laying around in MY yard too.

 The leprechaun takes an OK beating and we get to see a stick through the eye but the movie isn't loaded with gore or violence. Sure when the deaths happen they're brutal but the body count is depressingly low when it could have been higher. I guess they were aiming for more laughs and shrieks, and this becomes more apparent as the movie rolls on.

 As I said before, a mean spirited leprechaun placed in a more serious movie could have worked wonders. They went the opposite direction but still managed to entertain on a suitable level.",1379635200,,2634,4.449064449064449

Leprechaun (1993 supposedly) is a movie that's both horror-based and humor-based.  It stars the highly overrated (both in looks and acting ability) Jennifer Aniston, and Warwick Davis (one of the Ewoks from Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi).  This was Aniston's film debut.  She does an adequate job, but nothing outstanding.  Davis plays the role of the evil leprechaun very well.  This is another one of those movies that has a small but sinister villain (similar to Chucky).  I give credit to the movie makers for coming up with such a villain as an evil leprechaun.  This movie has a cult following and believe it or not, had five sequels.  I heard a reboot of the franchise is in order for 2013.

Overall, this movie is worth a look if you can tolerate lots of humor injected into a horror movie.",1332115200,2,918,4.536585365853658

Leprechaun challenges our long held views of Leprechauns and turns them from a simple trickster into nearly immortal vile murdering creatures with all kinds of magical powers that would make you wonder how they ever get caught.

Leggy Jennifer Aniston plays a city girl who has moved into the country. She loathes the ""new"" house until she meets a hunk who is going to paint it. Her lines are well written, and her delivery is less so. Inside the house is a trapped Leprechaun and somewhere on the grounds is his hidden pot of gold. The writers did a good job creating humor and Freddy style dialogue, but they over did it to the point it distracted from the horror aspect from the so-called ""horror"" movie.

192792,1,1573624071,"Call me foolish for expecting an even half-quality film which centers around a demonic leprechaun killing for his gold, but this film was so awful it didn't even supply laughs. How this has a cult following -- or ANY following, for that matter -- is beyond me. How this utter trash spawned five sequels is even crazier. There's no way this brought in enough dough to supply the writer and the director for the sixth installment: ""Leprechaun - Back 2 Tha Hood"". The title enough is a red flag.

Speaking of the writer, this has to have been written by a seven-year old. It's probably some of the most tiring writing I've ever heard in a movie of ANY genre. Dora the Explorer has better dialogue. Hell, silent movies from the 1920's have better dialogue. How someone would sign for this movie is unbelievable. The chavs in my English class could form better sentences.

All four of the main characters are terrible, terrible actors--although it's Aniston at her finest. The worst is undisputablely Ken Olandt as the clich&eacute;d macho, wise-cracking hero. Robert Hy Gorman's role was very infuriating. I'm not sure if the director wanted him to be so obnoxious viewers wanted nothing more than to punch him repeatedly, but if that was his goal it's probably the only successful thing throughout the movie he accomplishes.

Something I can always count on when watching these older slasher (I guess that's what you would call this???) flicks are the awesome kills. They're always great. They usually make me chuckle at how ridiculous they are. Killing someone by jumping on them with a pogo stick was the only enjoyable kill of the movie. Come to think of it, I think this only had three kills in total. Even the body-count is miserable. Not even any of the four main characters died. That was basically what kept me watching--the prospect of one of them getting sliced `n' diced.

Basically every aspect of this film is a failure. How they could make a movie about a murderous leprechaun any worse than it sounds is astonishing. My brother even fell asleep while watching this. And it was eight in the evening.

I'm probably coming off as up-tight, but I'm really not. I know this movie wasn't supposed to be taken seriously--how could it be if the people making it weren't even taking it seriously?--but I can enjoy the campy, cheesiness of Friday the 13th. Hell, I love those movies! But this... this is just pitiful. Let me say that I know now why I managed to snag the first three in the series for a measly $12. Needless to say I think part II and III of this series may remain unwatched for a long, long time to come.

The oodles of negative things aside, ""Leprechaun"" did have one saving grace: Jennifer Aniston's legs.

I can't help it but I love this movie and will always even though it is not really technically the greatest movie ever. But how can you not love this popcorn fun with a wee Leprechaun who is on the evil side of things. This movie is just too much fun plus it has Jennifer Aniston in it that is always a plus. We always have fun watching this one and to be honest I have fun with every film in this series. This is the type of movie that you have to accept for what it is, and it is straight B level fun for sure.

The story is easy enough to follow as a man gets home from a trip to Ireland and has a bag full of gold. This is the type of gold you find at the end of a rainbow with a little Leprechaun attached to it. Well as a matter of fact he did have to get this from a wee one and now it is after him. He eventually with the help of a four leaf clover locks the Leprechaun in a crate and there he sits for years. That is until a group of people including Jennifer Aniston end up accidentally letting him out, then the fun really begins. As they try to come to terms with what is after them he starts to pick people off one by one in a lot of fun ways. In fact the scene in which the Leprechaun is pulled over by the police is absolutely classic.

This movie is nothing but popcorn fun and we have writer/director Mark Jones to thank for that. Man I love these 90's horror flicks because most of them were so much fun and did not take themselves seriously. Don't get me wrong I love the serious ones as well but you have to love films that are made for just the pure entertainment factor. The film looks good and has that 90's feel to it, man I miss them days. The deaths are really fun in this film and are over the top greatness, anything with an evil Leprechaun is over the top [lets be honest].

As for the acting in this movie it is great for this type of film plus it is fun to see a young Jen Aniston. But it is with out a doubt Warwick Davis that steals the show as the Leprechaun, man he was absolutely the perfect person for this role. His style, voice, and smile, and of course laugh make the character come to life. Ken Olandt was good in this as was Mark Holton who was great in the film ""Gacy"". Robert Gorman, Shay Duffin, and every one else were good in this movie, every one fit their role.

I happen to find this movie to be very entertaining but this movie will not be for everybody. I think it is a nice reminder that we need not take every film so serious because we could be missing out on a good time. When this film came out in theaters it made way more than its budget back so it was a success. Is this movie perfect, no, but it is a nice break from reality. Do I recommend this movie, yes indeed, but only if you want to have a good time.",1256083200,3,2779,3.9289520426287745

Easier said then done, his gold coins have been scattered a bit. In an act of revenge and remaining dormant for years this creepy little bugger is out to (oh my) kill!

Scare factors are low, but the eeriness lingers. Leprechaun makes for one scary looking slasher on the loose. Jennifer Aniston snagged a lead role in the film, only to have this be one of her more forgotten roles (typecast Friends anyone?!). The setting is a 'middle of nowhere' location, we've all been their. Creepy looking house in 'the middle of nowhere', with little to do and land that just grapples the surroundings.
One of the worst places to be with a killer on the prowl. The movie follows the slasher guidelines relatively well as it maintains the 'final  girl'. The film depicts a father with two kids, a worker interested in the fathers daughter, and an autistic fellow who's child like nature causes more trouble then his innocence would seem to carry.

Overall what else can be said about the film? Not the greatest scare, a bit slow paced, the quality is a tad low, but it's still a cult classic. Leprechaun is a decent flick, I recommend finding it on your television or maybe a rental.

It is the perfect template of a B movie.  You have the star(Jennifer Aniston) who winces everytime she sees it on tv at 3 in the morning or when someone heckles her by brining it up(like Stallone with Death Race 2000). This begs an interesting question: will she turn B just like Sly? We, Sid the Elf say yes. She lost her man to a former Billy Bob doing-blood pendant wearing-brother frenching harlot. It can only get worse from there. You also had a plethera of ""O, it's that guy"" actors. You had Derrick Morris(Zack's daddy from Saved by the Bell), the fat guy from Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Teen Wolf, Walter from Don't Tell Mom the Babysiter's Dead, and Larry from Summer School. I'm touched. Oh yeah, and the star of the show? An Elf. This guy made Sid a little mad the way he stole the jumping out of things and chasing people around move. But, we'll let it go for the greater good of B.

1 bear-trapped leg

1 wheelchair chase scene featuring Sid's Irish cousin

1 green bleeding Leprachaun

Running Time:  92 minutes

Rated R for language, violence, and gore.

The movie begins with an old Irish guy, drunk off his knocker, coming home to his house in North Dakota. He keeps saying he's rich and his wife keeps saying he's drunk, so he breaks open a bunch of ashes and takes out a few gold pieces. He reveals that he found a leprechaun (Warwick Davis) and now the leprechaun has given him all his gold. Having hold his precious gold stolen, the evil clubbed midget (or is it more politically correct to say ""evil clubbed little person""?) attacks the Irish guy's wife and kills her. Once he's killed someone, he can use their voice. (One of the many unseen aspects of the leprechaun, it seems.) He lures the old man into the basement and toys with him. Finally, the old man traps him in a crate and nails a four leaf clover to the box.  Fast forward to ten years later, with spoiled L.A. brat Tory (Jennifer Aniston) and her father move into the old Irish guy's house. She becomes friends quickly with her `hunky' (he looks like some country singer or something) nieghbor (Ken Olandt) and the town's pair of bumbling sidekicks, Alex and Ozzie (Robert Hy Gorman and Mark Holton).  The group unfortunately opens the leprechaun's crate and the idiotic, yet humorous terror begins.

The acting, as in all movies of the genre, is pretty bad. Jennifer Aniston shows very little of the talent that would later come out. No one on the face of the earth in 1993 was thinking that she would later become one of the most well-known actresses of the past decade, and her performance is an indicator why. Warwick Davis, of ""Willow"" fame, plays the famed leprechaun, but he seems more disinterested by the role and actually performing it with some dazzle.  The dialogue is pretty bad, although a couple of good lines do sneak by. Somehow, Leprechaun ends up equaling more than the sum of its parts with its juvenile humor and corny wit.  It's not a good movie by any stretch, but ends up being tolerable for an hour and a half.",1135900800,,2173,4.630208333333333

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Warwick Davis, Jennifer Aniston, Ken Olandt, Mark Holton, Robert Gorman, Shay Duffin, John Voldstad, John Sanderford. Score Composed and Conducted By Kevin Kiner. Written and Directed By Mark Jones. (R) For Violence, Gore and Profanity; 91m.; 1992.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Big city girl Tory Redding (Jennifer Aniston) has arrived in North Dakota to spend a summer with her father (John Sanderford). But when she gets her first look at the run down house they'll be staying in, she decides she'd rather get a hotel room. Coerced to stay by an attractive house painter (Ken Olandt) who suggests she might be scared to stay there, she quickly learns that there are good reasons to be afraid of old houses. Locked in a crate in the cobweb-filled basement is a nasty Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) who is accidentally unleashed by one of the house painter's assistants (Mark Holton). Now, it's on a rampage to find its missing bag of gold coins and its not going to let Tory or the house painters stand in its way. This is one of those nearly forgotten classics that reminds viewers big budgets aren't always best for horror films. The B-movie atmosphere actually drives the suspense and the enjoyment of this little gem. There's a great balance between hilarity and horror. Director Mark Jones keeps the pressure applied throughout the course of the movie, alternating between the two extremes and sometimes combining them for maximum effect. There's also a stellar cast of unknowns that help propel the momentum of the story. For starters, this movie represents Jennifer Aniston's big screen debut (as Tory) which is certainly a successful one. She fills her valley girl, L.A.-loving character with a sarcastic wit and an endearing personality that allows the viewer to care about what happens to her. Even at this early stage of her career, Aniston displayed the star-making talent that would carry her through the next decade plus. The only thing that doesn't suit her well is her brief moments of profanity. It's just too cute to hear her curse, it doesn't seem natural or believable in the context of the film. Ken Olandt is a little stiff as head house painter Nathan, but the viewer eventually warms up to him. Mark Holton (as Ozzie) and Robert Gorman (as Alex) make great focal points for the film, almost overshadowing Aniston and Olandt's top billed roles. But the undeniable king of this screen is Warwick Davis as the title terror. Davis has crafted a celebrated character almost the polar opposite of his sensitive, diminutive magician in ""Willow"" (1988). When his character sees himself in a mirror, obviously for the first time, Davis' reactions are priceless. He also has some ""Looney Tunes"" style fun on a skateboard that proves he's enjoying immersing himself in the role. Gabe Z. Bartalos' make-up for the Leprechaun is also a sheer delight. Instead of looking corny or hokey, the make-up adds depth to Davis' character. It even holds up well when fully lit and placed in close-ups. Another unique facet to the film is Kevin Kiner's subtle score. It delivers themes that could have been every bit as memorable as those found in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Puppet Master"" if they had been built upon over the course of the series. Instead, the themes were replaced with each passing production. There are only two real complaints with the set-up for this film. The first is found within the opening credits, which go on for far too long. They stretch out over the first eight and a half minutes of the film, popping up at odd intervals here and there and offering nothing more than a distraction to the viewer. With so few credits, one would think they would have been less time consuming. The second gripe can be found at the end of the movie where director Mark Jones sets up the perfect opportunity for a sequel (focusing on a curse) which is never followed up on in ""Leprechaun 2"". Overall, this is a fascinating study in low budget suspense which more than fills viewers' expectations. It's smart, unobtrusive trepidation that doesn't try to be some grand, blown-out-of-proportion Hollywood horror yarn. Taken at face value, it's one of the better scarefests genre enthusiasts are likely to find from early nineties terror.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.33:1 full screen presentation for this movie has a fair amount of grain, however most colors are bright. The only drawback is the fact that, while most of the exhibition is solid, there is some noticeable wear during a few key moments of the film. This disc would have had more relevance if more had been done to remaster the picture. The 2.0 Dolby surround sound can be surprisingly realistic at times. There's good separation and some intense bottom to the track which is made all the more remarkable by the fact that when the video quality isn't always up to par, the audio quality usually isn't either. This film shatters that mold completely. The film also has Spanish and French subtitles which are white and fairly clear. The front cover for this DVD features the Leprechaun coming out of a half open door on a black background. The back cover is a mishmash of photographs, a listing of ""special features"", a summary of the film and even the twenty-four chapter stops which break up this ninety minute movie. The disc itself looks like a flip disc, even though it's not. There is literally nothing on the DVD. No painted photograph. No silver design imbedded into the top. There's only a thin white stripe which runs around the center hole of the DVD to identify the film as ""Leprechaun"". Included with the DVD, on the inside of the plastic case, is a small booklet entitled ""Trimark DVD: The Ultimate in Home Entertainment"". All this booklet displays are names for other Trimark releases and a few DVD box cover photographs. The only real special feature accompanying the film is the original trailer (1:54) which is minimally entertaining but prominently betrays the B-movie limitations of its source material, which may make some discriminating viewers shy away.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Well, it's not much of a hidden feature, but it'll have to do. On the main menu for this disc, highlight the Trimark symbol in the lower right hand corner. You'll have access to trailers for the films ""Leprechaun 2"" and ""Slam"" (2:14).

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: While there's no nudity or sexual content in this film, Jennifer Aniston does spend the entire movie in a colorful, tight little pair of shorts which accentuates her gorgeous, tight little butt.

THE GORE REPORT: J.D. Redding (John Sanderford) receives a fairly bloody bite on his hand whilst searching for a meowing cat, which was actually the Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) disguising his voice. One luckless shop owner (John Voldstad) receives a creative death by pogo stick in a scene which has a passable amount of blood. A police officer (David Permenter) spends a great deal of time with phony looking blood on his face while fleeing the Leprechaun. In the best gore sequence of the entire film, Tory Redding (Jennifer Aniston) knocks out one of the Leprechaun's eyes with a nightstick and the Leprechaun replaces it with the eyeball of a corpse.

SAY AGAIN: ""Tory, honey, you really think money's all you need to get by in this life? Huh?"" - J.D. Redding (John Sanderford). ""Okay, I'll go with that theory."" - Tory Redding (Jennifer Aniston).

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. Horror purists would have undoubtedly appreciated a better transfer than this, but at least the film is on DVD. There's an accomplished blend of humor and butchery which should appeal to fans of this domain. There are good performances, some agreeable dialogue and a few truly awesome low budget special effects to reel viewers in. It's no wonder that this film would spawn five sequels.

People who are uptight and nitpicky probably won't.  This movie was made to be what it is.  It's not supposed to be a serious horror flick.  Anybody who assumed it would be HAS to be a little slow.  Who in their right mind would read the back of this movie and think it is going to be the ""ultimate"" thriller?  LOL.

192811,5,1573624071,"The 80s gave us horror icons that will last forever.  We got Jason, Freddy, Pinhead and Chucky.  The 90s tried to repeat this process, but it didn't work as well.  Sure, there were minor horror icons, but nowhere close to what the 80s gave us.  The best the 90s had to offer in terms of boogeymen was The Wishmaster, The Candyman(Tony Todd is fantastic), Jack Frost, Gabriel from The Prophecy, The Gordon Fishstick guy from I Know What You Did Last Summer, and of course, The Leprechaun.  I'm sure you've seen Leprechaun or one of the sequels anyway.  Alot of people hate them or just write them off as crap, but someone out there likes them coz they're up to six as of this review.  It's hard for me to take one star reviews of Leprechaun seriously.  People were expecting a real horror film?  Did they expect really pulse pounding, hair raising, nonstop edge-of-your-seat terror from Leprechaun?  The film is about a killer leprechaun, I feel I'd better just clear that up for you.  This film was never meant to be taken seriously and they go to great lengths to prove this over and over again throughout the film.  It's a comedy.  Sure, you'll find it in the horror section of your local video store, but you'll also find Army Of Darkness there as well.  Leprechaun is morbid and relies on a slasher film-type formula, but it's pure camp.  How's the movie?  Fun, very fun.  Warwick Davis is a joy to watch.  It's nice to see a short actor get steady work in the film business-especially as the lead actor in the films.  Mark Holton(who'll you remember as the rich kid who steals Pee-Wee's bike in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure) is very funny as the mentally slow painter who believes in the leprechaun and tries to get everyone else to believe as well.  The kid's rather annoying, as kids tend to be in these kinds of films.  Ken Olandt is the male stripper from Summer School(""My Aunt Ruth kissed me....with her tongue!"") and plays our heroic male here.  He's okay considering the material-pretty typical for this kinda thing.  Considering Jennifer Aniston usually stars in crap anyway, this is as good a start for her career as any, however it's better than anything else she's been in.  I also understand that she gets pissed if you bring this film up to her.  If I ever meet her I hope she signs my copy.  That's our cast and they play their roles very straight, no camp in them.  The camp all belongs to Davis, who's  silly rhymes and cool makeup are worth the price of admission alone.  Everyone else must have though so as well, coz he's the only character consistant film to film.  I'd highly suggest watching Leprechaun and be ready to scream, but with laughter not in horror.",1099872000,7,2682,4.561844863731656

192813,4,1573624071,"We have Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Chucky, and Britney Spears; so why not have a malevolent leprechaun played by the minuscule Warwick Davis of ""Willow"" fame? Davis's turn as the evil Irish urchin in this film translated into four sequels with another one on the way at the end of this year. In fact, the ""Leprechaun"" franchise may rank as one of the most rushed series in movie history. The first one came out in 1993, meaning that the powers that be behind this series made six films in ten years. Not bad, I guess, unless you are one of the unfortunate viewers willing to watch all of the ""Leprechaun"" films as I did recently. While the first picture is watchable and interesting in a purely mindless, harmless way, the rest severely suffer from the dreaded law of diminishing returns. I can't begin to imagine in what odd directions they will take Davis's character with future releases, but if the folks at Trimark decided to make six films we can rest assured that they are planning a few more before the game is up. My recent ""Leprechaun"" marathon tells me that game should have been up long, long ago.
Nothing beats an original idea, and the first ""Leprechaun"" film does spark marginal interest about the shenanigans unfolding onscreen. The film opens with a drunken Irishman named Dan O'Grady managing to capture a leprechaun, thereby forcing the little monster to give up his pot of gold. Regrettably for this son of Eire, the evil fairy isn't about to give up his wealth without a fight, tracking down the man who robbed him just in time to open up a big can of hurt on the man's wife and inflicting a massive stroke/heart attack type illness on O'Grady. Before he does so, however, Danny Boy traps the leprechaun in a wooden crate and imprisons him there by placing a four leaf clover on the top of the box. It seems that Irish folk monsters cannot withstand this powerful charm, and it looks as though the leprechaun will be trapped forever in this abandoned house.
Not so fast. A few years later Tori Reding and her father move into the decrepit house. Tori hates the new digs but rapidly adjusts to her surroundings when she encounters the buff Nathan Murphy, a local fella hired by Dad to paint the house. Along for the ride is the overweight but mentally challenged Ozzie and a smart mouthed kid named Alex, both of who work with Murphy in his paint business. Predictably, it isn't too long before Ozzie inadvertently lets the leprechaun out of his prison. Despite dire warnings from Ozzie about an evil elf on the loose, everyone laughs at such a ludicrous idea and goes about their business. Not for long, though, because all heck breaks loose at incredible speed: Tori's father suffers a serious hand injury requiring medical attention, Ozzie and Alex discover the pot of gold the Irishman left on the property, and the leprechaun emerges out of the shadows for all the world to see. The small demon demands the return of his gold, and if he doesn't get what he wants he will kill everyone he can get his hands on. Lots of moronic stuff happens throughout the film, like the leprechaun riding around on some sort of go cart contraption he just happened to find in a barn and getting pulled over by a local cop, Tori incredibly managing to contact the ailing Irishman at the local old folks home before he dies, and the gang finding a four leaf clover just in the nick of time to stop the creature. If nothing else, ""Leprechaun"" is worth watching for a few good snorts and chuckles. Look for the shoe shining incident and try not to laugh. I dare you.
Of course, none other than Jennifer Aniston plays the role of Tori Reding. A close viewing of the film reveals many of the mannerisms this actress made famous in her later career, such as scrunching her face up, gasping, and acting flustered. She doesn't have a fancy coif here, though, and that will surely disappoint die hard fans. No, the real joy of seeing Aniston in this movie comes from watching her acting and reacting to Warwick Davis's hammy performance as the leprechaun. In Roman times, when a successful general came home from battle to have his triumph through the streets of Rome, a slave stood next to him on his chariot and whispered in his ear that all glory is fleeting. The same principle should apply to Aniston anytime she has a hit movie, except this time the attendant would remind her that she starred in ""Leprechaun."" Seriously though, most of the performances in this movie aren't all that bad for a low budget horror film. The thespians in this picture certainly stand head and shoulders above the wretched hacks that appear in the ham handed sequels.
The DVD is a pretty basic number: a trailer for the film and a few other trailers for other Trimark junk adorn the disc. All of the ""Leprechaun"" DVDs usually have the same sorts of trailers, namely a few ""Leprechaun"" trailers and perhaps a sneak peak at one or two of the ""Warlock"" films. As for the transfer, the picture quality is good even though its in full screen. The first film in this series will never win any awards, but it is probably the best entry in the franchise. Not very scary, not too gory, and full of Davis's trademark cackles; that is the best you can hope for from this seminal moment in cinematic history.

192815,2,1573624071,"The basic premise of this movie isn't that bad: a really ugly, mean leprechaun is robbed of his gold, forced to lie trapped in a crate for ten years, and then comes out willing and able to kill everybody who stands in the way of his recovering his gold.  That could work.  Unfortunately, it doesn't, not in this movie.  Leprechaun is the sort of movie I might expect to see from someone who took a dare that he couldn't make a horror movie in less than seven days.  The movie does have one good thing going for it, though, and it's not Warwick Davis' inane portrayal of the villain.  Although you may never hear her mention this film among her credits, a young Jennifer Aniston glides enticingly throughout this entire film, making one forget at times just how silly and mediocre the movie actually is.  Aniston plays Tory Reding, a spoiled young lady from L.A. forced to spend the summer with her father in an all but condemned house in North Dakota.  She refuses to stay in the nasty new house only to run into a young painter outside who accuses her of being afraid, at which point she immediately decides to stay after all.  What  no one knows is that the house's former owner not only stole a leprechaun's gold, he trapped the little bugger in a crate down in the basement, sealed with the magic of a four leaf clover.  Thanks to Ozzie, a backward but good-natured member of the far from talented Three Guys Who Paint, the little green guy escapes and goes on the rampage again.  The brains of the painters' outfit, a 12 year old boy, actually finds a bag of gold at the end of the rainbow, yet still he (and everyone else) refuses to believe Ozzie's leprechaun story.  The rest of the movie consists of your basic ""when leprechauns attack"" scenario, providing nothing resembling fright or dark comedy or anything else.  There is a slight bit of blood and gore, but the leprechaun spends more time trying to be funny (with little success) than providing us with satisfying deaths.  Far too many ridiculous sight gags and tricks are played, insulting the intelligence of even the youngest of viewers, and the climax occasions nothing more than a shrug of the shoulders on the part of the viewer.

For a fun I would always throw in Leprechaun to get a chuckle out of the group.  So that is what Leprechaun is all about.  Its comedy more then horror.
What makes this movie fun is that Warwick Davis takes his role serious and has a lot of fun with it.  A ton of classic lines.
Jennifer Aniston is in this movie and its just funny seeing her in this film which makes it a even more of a classic.
