1339493,5,B00004BZ20,"If you like rap of ANY kind, or just Death Row, then this video is a must! I couldn't actually believe what i was seeing in it! If anyone ever doubted if death row was for real i was one of them, until i watched it at a  friends house. I never really liked death row before but after seeing this  it showed me what really go's on behind the scenes in the rap music  industry. im 100% completely sold on death row now. The're was absolute  hilarious stuff in it!, there was serious real gangsta stuff in it too and  that's for real!, like suge knight, k.c. & jo jo, 2pac, and at the...  (i'm not gonna give it away, but i will say your jaw will hit the floor  when you see some of this stuff that i just mentioned, plus others)! and i  was shocked at the ending (you'll see what i mean) and when you do you'll  know that these cats are for real! this video is more than just another  music vcr tape whatever you wanna call it, this is a keeper, and when i get  my copy (like i said i watched it at a friends house first because i didn't  know if i should bother buying it) i'm NEVER getting rid of it! It's  probably the most entertaining video(of any genre)i've seen since scarface.  Im tellin ya straight up this is the best home entertainment video i've  ever seen hands down.",952560000,38,1278,4.096774193548387

I really got to see inside some of my favorite singers  ... Like 2pac ( 1 of the greatest rappers to ever sing .. if not the best),  Suge Knight (AkA the CEO of Death Row Record) and Nate Dogg , To name a few  ... i feel that anyone who likes rap  or most of all the WEST COAST !  should see this movie... i though giving out Dre'z and Snoops home address  was a little out of hand ... but i got to say it was a Great way to end the  movie !

1339506,5,B00004BZ20,"well well as i look at some of the dumb reviews once agian. And lot of dumb people u write on revives on amazon that know nothing,they just have nothing better to do. Now people don't listen to those wackos with the other reviews because they are so wrong its not funny. First off just about 98% that said on the box is thier so i don't know why people saying nothing is thier and sec  the videos just about all of them are full maybe one or tow were short i should know i seen this movie so many times i lost count. How ever thier were other stuff death row came out with that had videos on it maybee those people were thinking of that and not death row uncut? huh could be so people get ur facts right before u write somthing.",1180483200,3,728,4.020689655172414
1339507,4,B00004BZ20,"I like it AND I don't Like it. What I liked is that it had some unseen footage of what went down at Death Row ( ex: behind the scenes of music videos, concert tours, etc.) and a Pretty good collection of music videos. The XXX music videos were also more than entertaining. What I didn't like was how unorganized the DVD was. Music videos were cut short and a poor scene selection. what also pissed me off was how the in between of a group of druggies dissing Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. It just totally disappointed me and made me regret buying it. Welcome To Death Row is obviously a better DVD than This.

 I did like the rare Music videos such as "" Lil Ghetto Boy"" from Dre's The Chronic"" and "" It Might Sound Crazy"" From Daz' Album, and Midnight Love from Snoop.",1175299200,2,762,4.1768707482993195
1339508,3,B00004BZ20,"I have learned that as consumers we are often impulsive in our purchases. My first mistake was not checking out the reviews before buying this DVD. I really didn't think about it much because I own Death Row Uncut on VHS and unlike the DVD it makes no promises, you get what you pay for and you don't end up disappointed because you know what to expect. I remember purchasing the VHS version when it was first released and how excited I was. I couldn't wait to get home and pop it in my VCR and when I did I was not displeased. After anticipating the re-release on DVD I didn't about think taking a bit of time to read the reviews in order to make myself aware of what I might be purchasing. I found that it is hard to navigate and there are several videos cut short. In fact, Suge is talking over one of the final videos which does not play even halfway through. I am a little disappointed but I am still a fan of Death Row despite the fact that they are notorious for screwing things up. If you are a hard core fan of the music and are willing to take the videos any way you can get them, this DVD is for you, if not, I do not suggest purchasing this particular item.",1171324800,2,1169,4.086956521739131
1339509,4,B00004BZ20,I bought this a while ago on vhs & while this isn't uncut it offers the best gangsta rap videos ever made. If you are 2 Pac fan you will love this from 2 Pac's Live performance of Dear momma to hit em up and 3 x-rated videos including one with Dogg Pound & the Realist who was a close friend of 2 Pac & sounds alot like him. All the concert footage is great from 2 Pac to the Dogg Pound you'll love it the narration plot I find annoying but very funny who the hell likes Gay Ass DRE Anyway!!,1108684800,5,491,3.823529411764706
1339510,3,B00004BZ20,"""Death Row: Uncut"" had the potentiol to be an amazing collection of classic videos, never-before-seen interviews, and live concert footage. While it does have all of these things, it also spends an annoying and pointless amount of time trying to drag all of its former artsits' names through the mud. Following four unnamed men in a car as they comment on a number of videos, ""Uncut"" takes what could have been an amazing concept and more or less urinates all over it. Our four narrators comment on every Dre video by informing us that addition to the fact that ""Suge made that nigga"" that he is in fact, a homsexual. If that isn't enough, they actually hire transvestite actors for a sketch in which they pretend to be Dre's lovers and pull out a certificate stating that the Doctor has been diagnosed with HIV. One of them even goes as far to say that late rapper, Eazy-E ""probably got AIDS from him [Dre]"". Pretty tasteless. The group also has some less than flattering things to say about Snoop Dogg, DJ Quik, and Nate Dogg to name a few. They also give detailed directions to the homes of Dre, Snoop, and Jimmy Iovine. The footage of Tupac Shakur is probably worth the price of admission on its own. You get a lot of his best videos plus some great concert footage and some behind-the-scenes stuff of him on the set of two videos, ""Made Niggaz"" and ""Toss It Up"". Another important thing to mention is that despite its title, all of the videos are not shown in their full time frame. Some of them, like Tha Dogg Pound's ""New York, New York"", are cut short less than a minute into them and a few of the videos advertised on the package aren't even in it. If only they had taken less time trying to bring down the careers of people who helped make their label what it is today, they might have room to show the full videos. All in all, this should be a worthwhile purchase for any past or present Death Row fan though all of the time dedicated to showing their bitter side is unneccesarry.",1084492800,4,1991,4.427792915531335
1339511,1,B00004BZ20,"This is so bad that I don't even know where to start.
I'm a big fan of DEATH ROW's EARLY WORKS, Tupac is myfav. rapper of all time and I love Snoop & Dogg Pound
The songs are cut short, some are only 20 seconds long and when they aren't playing short videoclips they have 3 haters who's riding around the city talking....
Plus the fact that they disrespect TUPAC by having Suge's friend THA REALEST who also appeared on CHRONIC 2001 STILL SMOKIN rappin and tryin to be Pac
I am truly surprised that some people has written that they like this item, I believe that SUGE paid them to say this or something however any normal Human being will not enjoy this.
THIS IS THE PROOF THAT DEATH ROW WILL NEVER RISE AGAIN",1065312000,,710,4.266666666666667
1339512,5,B00004BZ20,Suprised to find this on Amazon.  The nude videos were great.  I didn't know this was an adult store,1044057600,4,100,4.2105263157894735
1339513,5,B00004BZ20,"+I recommend this DVD only to those who are true GANGSTA rap fans.
For all you pop hip-hop nelly fans, this ain't for you!
This DVD features the early days of mainly Tupac, NWA members and Snoop.
It also features Kurupt, KC&JoJo, DJ Quick, Natedogg and others!
This is must have for any rap DVD collection.
If you are one of those fans i mentioned in my intro+.....
Buy Deathrow Uncut!
Peace
P.S.I also recomend Welcome to Deathrow!",1041897600,3,432,4.551282051282051
1339514,4,B00004BZ20,"Actually, this was and wasn't everything that I wanted it to be. One thing that I didn't like is how they diss on Dre and Snoop alot through the entire DVD, and even go talk to a real male prostitute saying that he did a ""job"" for Dre back in the day.
  Other than that I liked it, one of the main reasons I bought it though was for the scenes with Tupac. That's some of waht I liked the most, the best scene, in my opinion is when they're at the filming of ""Toss It Up"" on the coast of L.A. and Pac is just sittin there laughin and jokin around with Suge, K-Ci & JoJo. That brought back some good memories...
  Also, this DVD has some 'LoadTV' options if you put it in your comp, so that was a plus, and it features more than 30 Death Row videos, all with great setup's too, I still don't think the ""main characters"" were needed. But they did good, all in all, you should get this if you want to remember the day.

1339515,3,B00004BZ20,"This video is just strange. I don't even know where to start. First off--the video and sound quality are way sub-par. Plus-the music videos they show are censored and usually cut off. Another thing is-half way through the tape it turns into a p o r n basically. Its also silly that they spend the entire video dissing Dre and Snoop, dispite the fact that if it wasn't for Dre and Snoop there would be no Death Row video in the first place. Its just a very strange release. There are a lot of cool stuff for those who were hardcore death row fans (before they fell off). There are rare videos and footage from Snoop, 2 Pac, Dogg Pound, Dre, DPG, etc. So what it boils down to is that if you're a rap fan that wants to remember Death Row's glory days, then buy this video. Just don't get your hopes up too high.",1000512000,9,809,4.1923076923076925
1339516,4,B00004BZ20,"The begining of the video is classic Dre and Snoop videos, like nuttin but a G thang, and Dre Day, but they don't play the whole videos. They have some DPG, Snoop and a few X-rated videos, but the reason I bought the tape was for the 2pac footage. There are some cool behind the scenes shots at the Made Niggaz and Toss it up video shoots. There is some footage from Club 662 and the House of Blues Concert that is mixed in with the regular 2pac videos. I wish they would play the entire songs, but its better than nothing. If you really like the old Death Row videos or if you're a true 2pac fan, this video is definitely worth it.",998611200,8,632,4.104838709677419
1339517,4,B00004BZ20,"This DVD was great because it chronicled some 'behind-the-scenes' moments of Death Row Records, starting out with Dre, Snoop, and climaxing with the late great Tupac Shakur, including an unforgettable performance of ""Dear Mama""...some of the videos are hard to watch if you have any respect for women...(especially sistas) and in one video there is even someone trying to impersonate Tupac, and that to me was not cool. Other than that, I'd say that this is worth the purchase if you love hip-hop music, and get nostaligic every once in a while.",998438400,4,545,4.934782608695652

1339519,3,B00004BZ20,"I'll be as brief as possible.  The menu selection screens serve their  purpose, but look like they were done by a four year old.  The actual  videos are all there, bar one or two (no Sam Sneed, no Lady of Rage vid  either.) and there are some interesting alternative videos for Dogg Pound's  ""What Would U Do?"" and Dre & Cube's ""NBK"" altho'  both versions are inferior to the videos you'll be more familiar with. The  links between the videos are done by some guys sitting in a car,  reminiscing on Death Row's hey-day, but at the same time dissing Dre and  Snoop.  They say Snoop has sold-out and that Dre is gay, then go into one  their classic videos...very confusing.  Couple this with the fact that  no-one actually cares who these guys in the car are or what they've got to  say, and these links slowly become annoying and irritating (and the ending  is actually pathetic).  Also, for no apparent reason, they decide to give  out detailed instructions on how to find Dre's & Snoop's houses, which  is just some straight-up playa hating. Yes, some of the videos are cut  short, but only by 30 seconds or so.  The concert footage is quite good,  but the highlight of this DVD is the XXX rated videos.  Don't wanna sound  sexist ladies, but these vids pull no punches, are sexually explicit, and  coupled with the West Coast hip hop sound, make for very compelling  viewing. There's a half-baked slideshow and an even worse Trivia quiz, but  the scene selection facility basically saves the DVD, cutting out the links  and enabling u to blast all your favorites. Overall, worth having if you're  a back-in-the-day Death Row fan, but it's far from perfect.  More  behind-the-scenes footage and better links could have put this DVD up there  with the classics. But as it stands, Death Row Uncut is an average affair  at best.",965952000,8,1826,4.623824451410658

1339523,2,B00004BZ20,"First off, let me start by saying that I'm no Death Row Records ""hater,"" as I have every Death row album CD ever released (all 18), but this video is a disappointment in many ways. First: The sound  quality is NOT in Hi-fi stereo (whereas ""Murder Was The Case  Video,"" and every other contemporary, commercially released VHS video  are released in Hi-fi stereo as that is the standard for professionalism),  the sound quality is way below average and you'll have to turn your volume  up high as hell to even hear it (regardless of what hi-tech stereo  equipment that you're working with). SECONDLY: ALL THE VIDEOS ARE CUT (AT  LEAST A MINUTE BEFORE THE ACTUAL ENDINGS) AND THEY END SO ABRUPTLY THAT YOU  WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF YOUR BUDDIES DUBBED THEM FROM MTV's TOTAL REQUEST  LIVE LOL! THIRDLY: MOST OF THE VIDEOS ARE EDITED MTV VERSIONS (COMPLETE  WITH THE CHRONIC LEAF LOGO HAT THAT SNOOP, DOC, AND DRE WERE WEARING  THROUGHOUT THE ""NUTHIN BUT A G THANG"" MTV-LIKE CENSORED VIDEO).  LAST BUT NOT LEAST: All this video does is take cowardly shots at Snoop  Dogg, Dr. Dre, Interscope Records, etc. Why? What did they do to them?  I  don't understand why Suge and Death Row keep doing this. IF IT WEREN'T FOR  DRE, SNOOP, AND INTERSCOPE, THERE WOULD BE NO DEATH ROW. SUGE, MOVE ON AND  LEAVE THEM ALONE!  There are some videos missing too: Sam Sneed's U  Better Recognize, 2Pac's ""NEVER BEFORE SEEN VERSION"" OF  ""Toss It Up,"" DAZ's ""It Might Sound Crazy,"" 2Pac's  ""Hit 'Em Up"" (because the version that's on the tape is  unacceptable as they put in some stupid live concert footage), 2Pac's  XXXPLICIT VERSION OF ""How Do U want It"" (again, they put in some  stupid live concert footage and messed up another great video). If you are  a die hard fan of Death Row Records former splendor (AS AM I), you may  enjoy this tape (if you're not bothered by the anti-Dre/Snoop/Interscope  Records sentiments expressed in this video. But if you are bothered by  them, and/or you aren't a die hard fan, DO NOT buy this tape because you  will not like the abruptly ending videos, Suge and Death Row Records'  conspicuous jealousy that's being betrayed throughout this red VHS video  tape, etc.",956361600,47,2182,4.663157894736842

some of the promo videos are straight up porn videos
prior to 2Pac's death he was linked to Adult Film Actress Heather Hunter  so you see Heather all of her

Looking back it's ambitious that Death Row filmed videos this out there and graphic
but, like another reviewer said the audio is terrible
When they put this compilation together they didn't decode it proper or something
you can get 2Pac All Eyes on Me  Enhanced, Original recording remastered
but, this dvd gets super poor audio quality
It's a odd trade you get uncut music videos with horrid audio
If you grew up in the 1990's and loved hip hop/Rap during this time it's really a must have just don't expect to show off these cool videos with HQ sound!  I would love to see this get a remastering/special edition with more extras and a proper Dolby Digital 5.1 or
