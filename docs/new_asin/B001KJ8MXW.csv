8315041,3,B001KJ8MXW,"I've really gotten to like Korean cinema. I like their turns of plot and the movies, in general, are made well. Though intriguing as this might be, I was confused as to what they were trying to say. And I was equally confused during the presentation.

Here's the scoop. A South Korean guardpost, at the border between North and South, has twenty of the  Twenty one guards on duty brutally murdered. One guard remains. He's covered in blood and is holding a bloody axe. An investigating crew arrives. As the alleged murderer is the son of a high ranking official, the chief investigator has until dawn to unravel the mess before all is swept under the carpet.

There's a lot to like here. The viewer is watching as the investigation progresses and the story of what happened prior to the massacre unfolds in a series of flashbacks. That's one way I began to get confused. It took me awhile to get used to the characters so I wasn't always certain when I was in the ""now"" or in the ""then."" Then a supernatural agent is suggested but rather quickly swept aside. When the 'agent' responsible for everything is revealed they are vague as to the origin. They know who the 'instigator' is but why? They hint that it might have something to do with the never ending rift between North and South Korea. They also note that the 'agent' makes people violent. So is the agent indicative of some underlying social issue?

This is a pretty good watch. Shot well, cut well. Some of the music sounded as though I'd heard it in other movies. I guess it was my inability to discern, or their inability to communicate, the subtext for this whole thing, that kept me from giving it a better rating.",1366070400,,1678,4.528052805280528
