1668872,4,B00005UW80,"The previous review is right on the mark.  As one who used to go see tapings of the Carol Burnett Show at CBS Television City, this show took me back to Carol's comic timing and mugging (especially the blooper).  I'm a Broadway fan who will watch this over and over.",1015804800,3,266,4.3
1668873,5,B00005UW80,"This is simply the most elegant, sophisticated, witty collection of Sondheim I've ever seen. A combination of the well known and the more obscure, performed immaculately by a starry and talented cast.
Carol Burnett is a revelation, George Hearn as good as he's ever been, Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman are perfect and look wonderful and Bronson Pinchot (not the best known name this side of the Atlantic) is very funny.
Highly recommended.",1015804800,4,444,5.095890410958904
1668874,5,B00005UW80,"This is my new favorite DVD.  I was lucky enough to see Putting It Together on Broadway (although Pinchot was out that night) and have been waiting eagerly for this DVD ever since.  One important note - if you don't like Sondheim, I could see this getting boring easily.  However, if you consider Sondheim to be the greatest living writer for musical theater (and maybe even all time) then you can't miss this DVD.  The performances are spectacular.  Who cares if there's no plot really?  When you've got Pinchot's ""Buddy's Blues,"" Hearn's ""Good Thing Going,"" Barrowman's ""Marry Me A Little"" and Burnett's ""Getting Married Today"" all in a row, who could be blue?  Don't think I forgot about Henshall either - she, for some reason, isn't in that segment (couldn't she have sung ""Miller's Son?"") but shines earlier with ""More"" and in my favorite song in the show, ""Unworthy of Your Love"" with Barrowman.  If nothing else, the DVD is worth buying for the blooper -- it is truly hilarious - I wish I was in the audience THAT night!  What more can I say? Buy this DVD.",1015632000,12,1063,4.611702127659575
1668875,4,B00005UW80,"Take the songs of Stephen Sondheim and put them together into a revue format with really no storyline to propel them and you have Putting It Together.  Another in a long line of Sondeim Revues.  This production is a reworked version of an earlier incarnation that starred Julie Andrews several years back.  This time the cast includes Carol Burnett, George Hern, John Barrowman and Ruthie Henshall and Bronson Pinchot.
Burnett and Hearn play an older married couple to Barrowman and Henshall's younger couple intracting at a cocktail party. The two couples sing with each other, with their spouse and solo.  Pinchot comments and introduces each section of songs with usually one word like ""Love"".  The songs themselves usually comment on the persons state of mind or observation on that subject and can go from funny to poignant.  Each of the leads has their moment the spotlight and each shines brightly.  Sondheim has commented that each of his songs is like its own little play and his melodies can be haunting.  His words can often be complex and may require multiple listenings to really appreciate what they have to offer.  Watch how sometimes the singers words and the music tell two different stories.
It is great to see Burnett return to her roots on stage and Hearn, a veteren of Sondheim musicals, is in fine voice.  Barrowman and Henshall are better known for their work in Britian but are great as well.  Pinchot can sing and while his in and out of scenes can get annoying, he keeps things moving. The big question I guess is: Who would enjoy this DVD?  This is a must have for any diehard Sondheim fan or collector of Broadway Musicals.  I think the average viewer might have trouble staying focused after awhile as there is only so much Sondheim a person can digest, especially without a story to connect with.  Even this Sondheim fan,who knew all the songs, got distracted after awhile.  Burnett fans should beware, this is not the Carol Burnett of her variety series.  She is excellent in this but is more reserved than you may be used to seeing
Filmed in front of an audience over several performances, it is nice to see that producers are filming musicals for home viewing.  This way many of us can see some great performances and shows that we might not have been able to otherwise. One of the highlights of the DVD is the extra scene where Carol Burnett loses her skirt at the opening of Act 2 during one of the days of filming.  Very funny and very Carol Burnett.",1013731200,65,2486,4.662844036697248
1668905,5,B00005UW80,"OK, I'll admit I'm a huge Sondheim fan and was a little tentative about purchasing this DVD...now I'm upset I waited so long.

I must say, the first 2 or 3 songs didn't quite ""connect"" for me and some of you might feel the same, but wait...after that it truly soars.

The performances are flawless! I expected greatness from Burnett and Hearn (which they delivered), I was not familiar with the two younger performers from England.  WOW.  You almost want to hate them, because not only are they beautiful in appearance, but are performers of exceptional talent.  I'm going to try to find other DVD's and CD's featuring them.

I highly recommend this DVD.  It is a musical review and the ""light"" plot is used only to tie together the songs.  Some of the interpretations of Sondheim are new and exciting...others will remind you of classic Sondheim.

Enjoy this DVD.  It is well worth it.",1110931200,6,886,4.658064516129032
1668906,5,B00005UW80,"This is a wonderfull movie.  I'm a huge fan of Sondhiem and this revue is the best way to showcase his musicals.  I thought the set was amazing!  I liked all the chairs and the part where Ruthie picks up the small chair, ruining the illusion of it being far away, was hilarious!  ""This chair is completely out of proportion!""  Ruthie says in the tiny room.  Some people are too critical with George Hearn's dancing.  He himself said he was never a good dancer, but I think he was fine for a 70-some year old man who'se been working on Broadway for almost all his life.  The Blooper with Carol Burnett was hilarious!  They were doing the dance number ""Back in Bussiness"" and she looked a little uncomfortable.  When they got to the kicks, she said ""WooHoo!  Stop!""  they all got quiet, even the audience ""Ya' know what's gonna happen?""  and right infront of the audince, she let go of her unproperly hooked skirt and it fell to the floor!  The only thing I didn't like about the blooper was John Barrowman.  He acted like a monkey when her skirt fell.  He seemed a little gay.  Otherwise, this is the best movie-musical I've ever seen.  Buy it and enjoy.  Only thing I didn't like:  They should have had more songs from SWEENEY TODD and ASSASSINS.",1108166400,3,1246,4.453333333333333
1668907,5,B00005UW80,"There are so many wonderful things about this show. I do dislike the fact that different names are used throughout the DVD for characters. My other criticism is the fact that ""Hello Little Girl"" should be cut. It is just weird. I understand its purpose, but it sounds weird. They could have found a better song.

My favorite songs are ""Unworthy of Your Love"", ""More"", ""Marry Me A Little"", and Ruthie's part in ""Everday A Little Death"".

Ruthie Henshall, Bronson Pinchot, and Carool Burnette really have awesome stage presence. John Barrowman's voice is just so darn good that anything he does is perfect. George Hearn has an okay voice and zero stage presence. His dancing in ""Back In Business"" is terrible. My only criticism for Ruthie Henshall is the fact that it looks as though she sings through her teeth.

""BANG!"" IS AMAZING!

Songs I dislike: Putting It Together, Hello Little Girl, Waltz, Back In Business, and Like It Was.

Great DVD!",1103932800,,943,4.796296296296297
1668908,5,B00005UW80,"All of the actors in this production are great. It took a little while to get used to hearing the changes in some of Sondheims greatest songs, but in the end WELL WORTH the wait. The only flaw in the production is that some Sondheims best were not included. Sunday in the Park With George was only mentioned once, in a brief encounter with ""It's Hot Up Here"". Also, I am aware that the original production of ""Putting It Together"" was before the days of ""Passion,"" but in this version, which was way after Passion was on Broadway, there were still no songs from it. Aside from that, it is great. Buy it, and enjoy.",1096934400,,614,4.3478260869565215
1668909,5,B00005UW80,"First, let me say that I don't bow at the altar of Sondheim. I find some of his songs incredibly beautiful and others witty but less melodically enjoyable. So, why five stars for this revue? Because the performers are exceptional.

I honestly feel this is Carol Burnett's best performance. I used to believe that it was practically impossible for her to sing seriously, with sincere emotion. It always seemed that she simply placed a serious veneer over her comic persona. But the years have given her the emotional depth to be able to carry off the challenging dramatic weight of the songs she's handed here. Her subtle and well-sung interpretations of ""Every Day a Little Death"" and ""Could I Leave You"" hold up against any others.

But that's not all. Let me give equally enthusiastic praise to the two younger performers, John Barrowman and Ruthie Henshall. They are, as others have said here, simply spectacular. They've got it all -- great voices, talent, looks. Both deserve shows of their own.

This DVD is not to be missed.",1079481600,10,1031,4.813559322033898
1668910,5,B00005UW80,"I'd just like to stand up for one of the best arrangement of songs in a show.  I disagree with the last response given.  And to that I'd like to say, if you don't want a musical review... don't buy this.  That's what you're getting here:  Songs, taken out of the given circumstances of a show, and put into an order deemed appropriate.  It's made very clear that there isn't a strong plot line... hense it being a ""Musical Review.""  What plot line is there is obviously there to tie the songs together.  If you can't appreciate it for what it is, don't bash it for what it isn't.",1054252800,5,579,4.256880733944954

1668912,3,B00005UW80,"The staging is forced and stiff and the plot barely existent -- I have to say I enjoy listening to the original cast recording more than watching this staged production, but it's never a waste of time to watch talented performers singing Sondheim's marvelous songs.  George Hearn's energy can't match his costars', and, while  Bronson Pinchot's singing is better than Christopher Durand's in the original, he can never match Durand's arch hilarity.  Still, each singer gets to shine in individual moments, the greatest of which is Carol Burnett's ""Ladies Who Lunch"" -- a song I never cared for until I saw/heard her furious interpretation.  Sondheim purists may object to the way the cast sometimes plays fast-and-loose with tempos, but there's not a bad voice in the bunch and the orchestration is elegant, allowing the singers to shine.  Worth watching once, at least.",1041638400,2,870,5.098591549295775
1668913,2,B00005UW80,"I was enjoying this show until the second act.  The audio falls out often after that.  How they can sell it seemed to be beyond me.  Still it is a record of a B'way show.  As far as I am concerned every B'way should be preserved before it closes.  I am all for preserving the performences and staging, leaving it for future generations to enjoy.  ""Is anybody there?  Does anybody care?""  Lets save it for prosperity and for those who can't afford to get to NYC to see it!!  There might be profits to be made after the show closes!!!!!!!

1668924,3,B00005UW80,A cast that can't go wrong. I really would love to say I like it especially with the incredible Carol Burnette.

1668925,5,B00005UW80,"From the people who brought you the live taping of Jekyll and Hyde starring David Hasselhoff comes a new live taping. It's Stephen Sondheim's Putting It Together. Every moment is memorable from the moment Bronson Pinchot opens the show by telling us that he's been replaced by Regis Philbin to the End Credits. The musical is about 5 people at a cocktail party. An old couple (played by Broadway legends Carol Burnett, of Annie fame, and George Hearn, who recently did Sweeney Todd in Concert)host the party. The guests are a younger couple (played by John Barrowman and the amazing Ruthie Henshall, who is known for her performance as Fantine in Les Miserables in Concert) and a man who is simply known as the Observer. He shows us what kind of themes are in a show by Sondheim such as Seduction or Happiness. There are a lot of songs from many Sondheim plays and some from the movie, Dick Tracy. Sadly, there is only one song from my ultimate favorite Sondheim musical, Into the Woods. It's playing on Broadway. The only song is Hello Little Girl, which is played as a sexual encounter. Of course, it's being played as a sexual encounter on Broadway as well. There are some songs that were cut from some Sondheim musicals such as My Husband, the Pig, which was cut from A Little Night Music. I noticed that most of the title song, except for the first two verses, had been rewritten. My only complaints are that during the title song, George Hearn's microphone goes out. Now that's an onstage blooper. Plus, they didn't show the Entr'acte. Instead, they jumped right to the first song of the second act. Mind you, this might have all been filmed in one night. It might have possibly been the night that the onstage blooper occured. In case anyone's wondering, the onstage blooper was not Carol Burnett messing up in a song. They had started the second act. Every thing was going fine until Carol Burnett told the conductor to stop. Then, she pulled up her skirt and said, ""You know what's about to happen?"" Then, she let go of her skirt and it fell to the ground. One of the straps broke. John Barrowman was laughing and yelling, ""Please tell me you got that on tape."" Your wish came true, Johnny. The onstage blooper also incorporates the lost Entr'acte, which is an instrumental of You Could Drive A Person Crazy. Plus, the role of the Wife has not only been played by Carol Burnett but by her dear friend, Julie Andrews. That was in London. One more thing. Putting It Together is actually the sequel to another Sondheim revue called Side By Side By Sondheim",1029369600,27,2562,4.596069868995633
1668926,5,B00005UW80,"I saw this version of the show when it was in Los Angeles and I fell in love with it.  It combined Carol Burnett, John Barrowman, and SONDHEIM! all in one.  Sondheim's songs haven't sounded better and it's one of those shows that you can watch anytime. Rather than playing a CD with one of these songs that I want to hear, I just pop in the DVD and go to that number.  The cast is incredible! The DVD blooper is hilarious and thank god its in Dolby 5.1 surround sound.!  All I need is a state of the art home entertainment center to really appreciate this DVD.",1028419200,9,560,4.157407407407407
1668927,1,B00005UW80,This was not one of the best plays in the world and would be trash if it were not for Carol Burnett lending her name to it. The plot is flimsy and some of the songs painfull to get through. It would be better to watch all the plays the songs were collected from rather than see them in their butchered state.,1023494400,4,308,3.9838709677419355
1668928,5,B00005UW80,"I am elated that such shows like ""Putting It Together"" are being preserved on DVD.  It is a wonderful DVD with wonderful performances.  The music is Sondheim at its best, and the performances are great.  Bronson Pinchot is the only thing I do not like on the DVD because he is not much of a musician and looks uncomfortable 2/3 of the time.  If you needed one reason to buy this DVD it would be Ruthie Henshall.  Everything she does is just heaven.  Need I mention how brilliant Carol Burnett is?",1022976000,,496,4.395604395604396
1668929,4,B00005UW80,"I looked forward to seeing this production, since I had not been able to see it in NYC.  I enjoyed it a lot, especially the performance of Carol Burnett, who I think does some of her best work here.  The whole cast does a marvelous job of the material, singing and dancing very well.  The blooper is a riot and typical of Carol Burnett's sense of humour.  She's a pro all the way and makes the best of something very embarrassing that happens(I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it).  Eric Shaffer, the director, is an acquaintance of mine and I've grown to love his work.  He's quickly becomming a major talent among directors and I hope he continues to do good work, such as this.",1020384000,6,689,4.34375
1668930,5,B00005UW80,"I was riveted to this production, from Bronson Pinchot's opening number, to a stunning ensemble finale of ""Being Alive""...which was beautifully arranged and orchestrated.  I'm a big Sondheim fan, and this is an absolute must for anybody who appreciates this musical theatre giant.  The DVD is terrific quality, and includes a really funny on-stage blooper, and an interview with Carole Burnett.
The performances were all very good, but Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman steal the show as the young couple. Both are stunning to watch, and their voices soar.  Ruthie shines in ""Sooner or Later"". John Barrowman sings ""Pretty Women"", and in a surprising twist, takes the character Sweeney Todd's part, while George Hearn takes the back seat and sings the judges' part.  Carole Burnett demonstrates her wicked comedic talent in a slowed-down version of ""Getting MArried Today"", but also shows dramatic depth in ""Could I Leave You?"" and ""Everyday a Little Death"".  Vocally, she's not as strong as the other cast members, but it is forgivable.  George Hearn and Bronson Pinchot were the weaker links in the production.  George Hearn reverted to talk singing too much for my liking, although when he decided to sing properly, he was in fine voice.  Bronson Pinchot has less opportunity to shine than the rest of the cast members.
Overall, an excellent DVD, highly recommended.",1018051200,16,1370,5.13963963963964
1668931,5,B00005UW80,"Yep, that's right, I was there the night they filmed this production, blooper and all. It was just as funny as it looks, if not more so.
As a fan of the original, Julie Andrews version of this production, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the changes made to the song list and sequence. The stars did a bang-up job. If you've even HEARD of Stephen Sondheim, you should own this DVD.",1017446400,3,386,4.301369863013699
1668932,5,B00005UW80,"I love the fact that Cameron MacKintosh films his stage shows with several cameras at live performances.  It's a much more rewording viewing experience than the attempt to recapture the theatre experience in a studio.
Well, MacKintosh put it together once again, and we can all be glad of it!  This is one of those very rare theatre treats in a time when theatre is tending to get more and more about less and less.  The combination of Stephen Sondheim's music and the talents of the likes of Carol Burnett, George Hearn, Ruthie Henshall, John Barrowman and Bronson Pinchot is really more than a theatre enthusiast dare wish for, but it's all there on this DVD.  If that weren't enough, we also get the extra treat of a little on-stage blooper that took place the evening this was filmed, which caused Burnett to literally stop the show.  This is added as extra footage, which will have you falling on the floor laughing as it did John Barrowman.
Carol Burnett shines through it all, but will reduce you to tears of laughter with her renditions of ""Lovely"" from ""A Funny Thing Happened..."" and ""I'm not Getting Married Today"" from ""Company"".  That said, she also pulls of some very touching moments, such as ""Old Friends"" from ""Merrily We Roll Along"".  Hearn's voice is still, despite his age, beautiful and strong.  Ruthie Henshall wows you on several occasions, but especially with ""More"" from ""Dick Tracey"".  John Barrowman, who tends at times to be stiff like a body-buider, overcomes this for the most part, and manages to pull off some difficult dancing and singing with a sweet charm that you would not normally associate with a man built like a football player.  The surprise of the evening is Bronson Pinchot in his first musical role.  That he is a talented, slapstick comedian is known since he starred in ""Blame it on the Bellboy"", but who would have thought that he could sing, too!  He has the timing and agility of Charley Chaplin with the grace and style of Fred Astaire.  Somebody please make this guy a huge star before we all go through menopause!

Even though I singled out Carol Burnett, this show has an exceptional cast that gives this recording a cabaret feel.  The interweaving of Sondheim songs is the best I've seen to date, and I've seen a lot of them.

7955540,5,B00005UW80,I could not get enough of it. It keeps your attention the whole time. The songs are very entertaining and some are quite beautiful. George Hearn was amazing and Carol Burnett was a riot. Its a play that doesn't require props or different sets because the performers worked really well without them.

7955543,5,B00005UW80,"Love this DVD. Wish it had a separate CD sountrack available.

If you only think of Carol Burnett for her comedy, you will be pleasantly surprised, she can sing, too. George Hearn is in fine singing form, as always. The two of them together looked and sounded like a real-life married couple.  John Barrowman (from Doctor Who) is great, and watching Bronson Pinchot made you wish he had more solos.

Ruthie Henshall was in a way the weakest part of the show--her accent was somewhat annoying (on the order of Marina Sirtis' accent in Star Trek: TNG--if that grated on your ears, Ms. Henshall's will too), but she can sing and dance well.

I can't say that I liked all of the original shows (e.g. Sunday in the Park with George) these songs came from, but watching this DVD makes you want to seek out the original shows to view or re-view, as the case might be.

Well worth buying!",1160179200,2,880,4.475
7955544,4,B00005UW80,"If you are a fan of Stephen Sondheim, or yet to discover many of his finest musical numbers, this show taped live in 2001 is a must.

A strong team, all class acts individually, take us through some of the highlights from Follies, Company, A little night music, Sweeney Todd, Into the Woods, Merrily we roll along, Sunday in the Park with George, and more.

Arguably, some numbers work better out of context than others, but the production is strong and though a ''review'', based around an older couple and a younger couple, staged with minimal scenery and props, the concept works well and the cast are strong throughout.

Highlights are Burnett's ''Ladies who lunch'', who gets this number just right, finding  seething frustration with the world, but thankfully not resorting to the wayward comedienne hectoring, yelling, and crass overacting of others in this number.

Henshall smoulders sensually in ''Sooner or later'', and Barrowman joins her effectively in ''I am unworthy of your love'' from Assasins, one of Sondheim's most lyrical creations. Bronson Pinchot has a fine comic gift and makes the most of it throughout.

George Hearn is the very model of Sondheim style, singing off the text in an easy, unaffected manner. His moving rendition of ''We had a good thing going'' from Merrily we roll along, is masterful, and worth the price of the disc alone. As the older couple, his scenes with Burnett are a joy throughout, and the relationship between them always feels genuine.

Other numbers worth mentioning here include Hearn and Barrowman, who make a fine job of ''Pretty Women'' from ''Sweeney Todd'' (about the best I've heard it done), and the ensemble numbers including ''Putting it Together'' and ''Being Alive'' work well. The notoriously difficult opening of Act 2 of ''Sunday'', ''It's hot up here'', is superbly handled out of context and delivered with amusing results.

This is a multiregion disc although recorded NTSC format. Considering this was taped live, the audio recording is first rate (5.1 surround), the voices are crisp and there is plenty of detail from the slick and sassy ensemble in the pit. Occasionally, some of the orchestrations sound a little thin with such a small scale band, but this is a marginal quibble. If you want to view an enjoyable retrospective of Sondheim's work, effectively staged and performed with skill, then don't hesitate to view this.",1155600000,5,2403,5.0201005025125625

This is a MUSICAL REVUE, which is, simply put, a PLOTLESS variety show with a unifying factor (in this case, Sondheim). The fact that there was a thin plot was nice, but not a requirement. Sometimes I am amazed at what people write, based on sheer ignorance. The cast was great, especially Burnett, who still has an incredible set of pipes for a woman her age. I found Ruthie Henshall to be a little irritating, though. True, she is pretty and can dance and sing, but the way she sings through her teeth half of the time, without opening her mouth, began to grate on my nerves a bit. But I'm nitpicking. Order this.
