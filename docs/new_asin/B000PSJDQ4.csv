2827943,5,B000PSJDQ4,"for me to order a DVD of a show I have already seen w/o commercials, no less, it has to be extra-ordinary.
And nothing ordinary about it I might add post haste

A fun, somewhat behind the scenes look at the house that Ahmet did in fact build.

But for me, its the look on the faces and the quietness of the rock superstars, the reverence without arrogance that is paid to Ahmet that compells me to make the purchase",1188432000,8,415,4.175
2827944,2,B000PSJDQ4,"Two hours on Atlantic Records, and literally not one word about some of the most important music in American history:  the Atlantic recordings of Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus or John Coltrane.  While the pop stuff's great, these, along with Ray Charles (who is well represented here), are the very things that make Atlantic different from every other label.",1188172800,12,360,5.189655172413793
2827945,4,B000PSJDQ4,"This was a great documentary, but it is only part of the story.  I met Ahmet back in 1976 when he was helping Mic Jagger form his own label and they were recording my friend, bluesman Luther Allison.  I recently saw Ahmet again at the Jazz Musuem of Harlem promoting the music he loved best, jazz.  Even in his last years ,he never stopped tirelessly pushing jazz and black music in general.  He was always headed to somewhere to try to keep the music and the legacy alive.
I say part of the real story, because I know many of the artists that were with Atlantic and most were unhappy about the way they were treated there.  Ruth Brown, who helped build Atlantic, had to secure work as a domestic to survive... whereas Mic Jagger has never looked back.
This documentary is only deals with the Ready for Prime Time story of what Atlantic did.  There were decisions that affected a lot of people involved with Atlantic, that were unfavorable to them.  Why do you think Ray Charles left? As you watch the movie , you have to read between the lines.
Ahmet confronted racism, but sometimes he was also a part of it.  The needs of the business often overshadowed what he knew was right. Still what he did was invaluable to music , as we know it in America.
He says in the film that there are only two types of music in America, 'there is black music and then there are those who imitate black music'... a very profound, sad and true statement that most do not want to recognize or accept.
So this movie is one slice of the story.  Out of the light of the cameras , you will hear a much different one.. as I have.
It is still worth having because it is a major part the history of music in this country.  I also pre-ordered a copy and now I can enjoy it whenever I like.  I can use it to educate kids that are too young to remember it as I did.  I grew up with Atlantic.  One of my first 45-rpm records was Aretha singing ""Respect"".  But I had heard the Alantic artists all thru my childhood.
Ahmet Artegun is an American hero.  He gave the world music that we still enjoy today. The music he recorded has influenced every artist since the label was created.  This film should be viewed by any serious student of American music or of American history. The music reflected the times and the changes in our culture.  It shows the good and the bad, if you read between the lines.
Who will take up the cause now that Ahmet is gone?  Who will fight to see that Americans greatest and only art form, black music, is not forgotten.  Maybe some teen watching this film will be the next restless soul and try to seek justice for those who are often forgotten.
The world will never be able to repay the debt it has to Ahmet for what he has done to enrich the lives of all of us.  He triumphed not because of America, but in spite of it.",1184976000,25,2819,4.233644859813084
2827946,5,B000PSJDQ4,This is an exceptional piece of Rock History told by one of the people who invented it.  Anyone who is anyone has links with Atlantic and Ahmet knows and is loved by them all.  A must for all rock and roll historians.,1183939200,3,217,4.142857142857143
2827947,5,B000PSJDQ4,"This program is enormously entertaining, with tons of great footage of the artists, interviews, and hilarious anecdotes.  I worked at Atlantic for several years and can attest that this documentary delivers an informative survey of the man and the label (though i could argue about certain artist omissions), which produced so much great music covering every genre.  If you're a serious pop/rock/R&B/jazz fan, you really owe it to yourself to see this, and if you want to learn more about Mr. Ertegun and Atlantic, i HIGHLY recommend the book he wrote several years ago, ""What'd I Say"", which has hundreds of stunning photos and commentary from him and the others (artists and executives) who made it all happen at Atlantic (the book is pricey, but totally worth the money - product link is below)

2827948,5,B000PSJDQ4,"Most informative and enjoyable.  Sadly, we look back at a world that's gone forever, replaced by the current trash with pretensions to music.

If you enjoyed the music in the film, consider ordering ""Atlantic Rhythm & Blues, 1947-1974"".  The sound should be and could have been better, but the set is well worth having.

Now if only Columbia would reissue the Ethel Waters gatefold 2-LP set that came out back around 1980, and include ""On Stage and Screen""....",1178150400,3,460,4.858974358974359
2827949,5,B000PSJDQ4,"I saw this entire 2-hour show on New York's PBS station last night and it was great. You can feel Ahmet's passion for music as he relates his childhood experiences in Turkey, his passion for America (""the land of cowboys, dancing girls and jazz"") and explains the formation of Atlantic Records.

Rather than become a diplomat or a ""civil servant like my father"" (Ahmet's father was the Turkish ambassador to the U.S.), Ahmet and his brother created America's most important record company. The story of Atlantic Records is as much about racial integration and artistic integrity as it as about music.

It's also great to hear the musicians' side of the story. The very recent footage of conversations between Ahmet and Robert Plant, Ray Charles, Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Bette Midler really shows the respect and admiration all these great artists had for him.

Finally, this is an entertaining show, featuring some great laugh-out-loud moments. My favorite is when Ahmet tells of how, as a 12-year old, he hailed a cab in mid-town Manhattan and said to the driver ""Take me to Harlem."" All he wanted to do was hear some jazz and within a few minutes, he found himself at the Plantation Club and later, at a rent party rubbing elbows with musicians and dancing girls.

Having grown up listening to Atlantic artists like Led Zeppelin, the Stones, Crosby, Stills & Nash, etc., I found this show absolutely fascinating.",1178150400,56,1432,4.8806584362139915
2827950,5,B000PSJDQ4,"I just got done being transfixed by this program on American Masters on PBS. Ahmet Ertegun's life was incredibly full, full of joy and music for many years.

2827990,4,B000PSJDQ4,"Motown still reigns as the world's #1 label in producing superstars, creating its own genre of music and as much a part of American history, as it has been, in music history. However, Columbia and Atlantic reign as two big mainstream labels with Atlantic having a rich history in both classic rock and southern R&B. Columbia graduated from original cast albums, soundtracks and Mitch Miller A&R into rock giants. But, the other ""A"" in music labels is Arista Records, which dominated the late 80s thru the 90s.
Motown owns the distinction of creating great artistic specials like their Emmy winning, ""Motown 25"" that broke Nielsen ratings hit winning not only the week, but, also the year's (1983) Most Watched Entertainment and Variety Special. Atlantic had a 50th Anniversary concert that aired in 4 hours on HBO. Though it had none of the magic of ""Motown 25"", it was a good retrospective of the label that also complimented this book.
Artists like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Ruth Brown dominated gut-bucket R&B in the 60s, trying to the uptown feel of Motown Records, against the raw southern R&B distributing the Stax label, that had racially mixed musicians down in Muscle Shoals, Alabama....in contrast.",1406851200,,1215,5.01980198019802

2827996,4,B000PSJDQ4,"Exceptional docu. about a rich ""foreignor"" kid mad over the blues 78s, making millions here founding an independent label. Nearly going broke...then regrouping....eventually as Time-Warner....an *American* story!

DVD itself runs about 10-12 minutes too long and could have edited more of the last 5-6 signed acts. Collins, Midler, Kid Rock, etc., they're okay...but where was Mingus? Little Richard was with Atlantic for about a year and had a regional gospel hit. Would have loved a lil' from Rich'.

This item actually works as a true companion to the cool book by Ertegun right hand man Jerry Wexler, ""Rhythm and the Blues"".

A small stretch on R & B reparations is included....Ruth Brown, I believe the very first successful Atlantic singer is shown on stage, soulin' through another set. She has a short interview segment where she expresses a certain interest in....getting some money at some point. A Foundation was set up through Ertegun. Too little too late..but much better than business as usual.

Another unexplored area here is suggested by a wierd question to Ertegun by a wierd questioner...did you ever ""do drugs""? (Although, considering his well-publisized Friday night forays into that Studio 54/Heavy Metal lifestyle, not tangential). Serious reply? Nope. Any reflections on that ugly underbelly of the culture? No.

Overall, this is highly recommended...even for those who feel that they got the gist of the real story and love their ray Charles and Clovers and Drifters and Otis Redding collections. You'll be floored as I was learning about such things as ""by the way, you guys (Atlantic) own the Woodstock movie"" .",1355961600,,1638,5.1893939393939394
2827997,5,B000PSJDQ4,"Love Atlantic records. I grew up listening to many Atlantic recordings. It is great to see the
makers and shakers behind the developement of this great music company.
Kudos to the seller.",1349913600,,187,4.875
2827998,4,B000PSJDQ4,"I would have given this 5 Stars, as I believe Atlantic Records was that great of a label. Growing up in the 60s, those red and black Atlantic 45 RPM labels made me buy the single without knowing or having heard the single just by the sheer fact if it was on Atlantic, it was bound to be great.  So, one would think, I should give a 5 Star review.  Here is why I did not, it is for what it is missing.  1. This documentary praises Ahmet a bit too much.  While he was essential and the driving force behind the label, it is too much of a love fest.  If I wanted to hear and see a love fest; I would hear Clive Davis talk about himself and spin how he was the greatest thing to music that ever happened. 2. It completely does not talk about Atlantic Jazz.  Atlantic was started as a Jazz label, and launched some major careers in the early 50s...Coltrane, Coleman, Hancock, Davis, etc.  None of this is mentioned or it is glossed over so quickly, you can not even hit pause to find it. 3. The ""dark side"" of Atlantic.  Pure and simple, they screwed Stax Records of all its masters with its distribution deal. Jerry Wexler always claims he and Ahmet knew nothing about it, and that the attorney's did that.  And Jim Stewart (Stax) states he never read the fine print.  Not sure who to blame, but is a sad commentary and a rather dark blemish on what was considered to be one of the GREAT LABELS ever. (Get ""Respect Yourself...the Stax Records Story"" for those details).
Based on these three MAJOR omissions to the documentary I must give it 4 Stars.  The remaining is a fascinating tail of a great label and its continued dominance to this day.",1344470400,,1640,4.275080906148867
2827999,4,B000PSJDQ4,"I enjoy finding as much (Atlantic Records) studio talk as I can, then use it to form my own opinion of people. Ahmet was business minded, and fair, but if someone changed something without his approval, he'd scold. This was true of a [unknown] black female, for removing a bar, during Bobby's studio session ""Queen Of The Hop"".
Was nice to see Tom Dowd, who I admire. Overall, the documentary was enjoyable! Was funny to find Led Zeppelin locked Ahmet out of the studio, maybe so their first hit wasn't Whole Lotta Splish Splash! Still not sure why black oriented music began to die during the late '60's, wish there was more about this in this film, causing Atlantic [and others] to contract more and more white artists.",1337212800,,721,4.640625

2828001,5,B000PSJDQ4,"I wished there was more early footage of the hep cat himself when he was in his early prime as head of Atlantic. Mostly, this relies on late life footage that is still extremely interesting, such as when Ahmet and Ray Charles sit at the piano and reminisce, or with Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Only late Jerry Wexler is seen here, also, which is too bad because he would have been interesting as a young man, driving the record company to new heights along with Ahmet. I just read a new bio of Ahmet and this makes the perfect supplement. You will need to see this if you know the story of Atlantic Records.",1329782400,,609,4.304347826086956

Ahmet is one of the main reasons why the British invasion progressed at the speed it did. With Cream and Led Zeppelin he had the 2 groups to push forward and not worry about the quality of the music.

2828004,5,B000PSJDQ4,What an amazingly detailed account of the Atlantic Records long run.  Anyone who grew up loving rock and roll owes it to themselves to see this CD.  I purchased it as a birthday present for my husband and for a friend who had been a 1970's DJ.  They both raved about it.  It really gives an indepth look behind the scenes of rock and roll and how it all fit together.  Ahmet Ertigen was a genious!!

2828005,5,B000PSJDQ4,"I actually found this film in the video rack at a dollar store. It sat unopened for a few months while I was busy filming and studying films that I needed to view. I have been aware of Ahmet Ertegun for some time but this documentary is a mind blower. I wish that Capricorn records and Duane Allman's session work were included. The crisis that led to (Atlantic) being sold to Warner Brothers in 1967 is described within this film. Warner Brothers was one of the ""Big Five"" in film since 1915 so Atlantic would have probably gone under if the move was not made. The mission of Atlantic records is described in detail as the bold moves that were made. The film touches on the payola scam which was very open before the 1960's, now it is sublimated within ""New Artist Fee's"". Unfortunately for a small label like Atlantic it had to battle against music labels that were part the Film industry since the inception of motion pictures. Bottom line is that even if this is a promotional propaganda film as some reviewers believe, it stands on it's own legs as an excellent documentary. I also feel that the inclusion of current film footage such as ""Ray"" which is a Universal picture release discredits this being a promo piece. Either way it is an excellent documentation of the history of Atlantic Records. Craig Barr.",1312070400,,1314,4.595744680851064

The passion and hard work the Ahmet placed in music, is clearly displayed as are his remarkable talents as a business man, song writer and musician. Bette Midler does an awesome job at narrating this commentary, and the interview with Ray Charles, and all the others was amazing. I ordered this several months ago, and I enjoyed it so much, I bought another to leave unopened and add to my collection. This DVD will take you back in time to enjoy the music that your parents did (well may have) but it is truly a must for any music enthusiast!",1311897600,,586,4.336363636363636
2828007,3,B000PSJDQ4,"Very close to what was noted above, in that it is a celebration of Ertegun, which is fair enough. He accomplished the seemingly impossible task at the time in getting black music before a wider audience - and what's wrong with that? Questioning his interest in the music (or the artists) is specious - the reverence with which they regard him is testament enough, without it being second-guessed from the perspective of listeners sixty years on. If not for Atlantic, much of the music would have never been recorded or heard.

But, all that said, the documentary does have a point of view and pushes it. I think it's telling that Bobby Darin's segment is dismissed (teen idol who drove Herb Abramson away kind of thing) in that Ertegun loved his work and produced it when he was their first (and only white artist). Darin's work kept Atlantic in business in 58-61 and gave them a chance to continue. Yet, that aspect, like the Stax deal, doesn't have a place in the 'super cool' and 'too hip' storyline that the documentary wants to adhere to.

Useful background, though and when viewed in combination with the documentary on record producer, Tom Dowd (although it also suffers from the 'super hip' attitude, but Dowd's personal story is incredible), gives a great picture of getting this music (and a LOT of music in general) recorded, played, aired, and in the public consciousness, which is, after all, what it was about. These artists wanted to be heard - Ertegun made it happen.

So, yes, buy it or rent it, watch it and keep listening, reading, learning about all of it.",1297468800,2,1576,4.702898550724638

I will just say that if you are a fan of popular classic Soul & Rock music, or just want to see & hear a truly fascinating, great story, this DVD about the wonderful Mr. Ahmet Ertegun will not disappoint!

 Mr. Ertegun's love of original American Jazz, combined with his exceptional ear for musical greatness in all forms, led to his transforming Atlantic Records into what was perhaps the greatest record company of all time.

The roster of great artists he signed and oversaw at the label is mind-boggling; Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, Big Joe Turner, The Coasters, The Drifters, Solomon Burke, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Ben E. King, Cream, Eric Clapton, The Rascals, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, and so many others.

So much great musical talent, influence & history! In addition, the story is so interestingly told.

This DVD should be in every popular music fan's library. Top shelf all the way!",1293148800,,1033,4.846590909090909
2828010,2,B000PSJDQ4,"I thought this was a documentary but it's a celebration of Ahmet Ertegun, a promotional piece.  Don't look for an impartial portrayal.  Ertegun appears fun loving and likable enough.  As a kid he loved Jazz and he pays lip service to ""Black Music"" throughout the film.  But, as one reviewer noted, where are the Jazz musicians he recorded?  Kid Rock freestyles something to the effect that  Ahmet is the blackest cat he knows.  What nonsense.  Which ""Black"" are they talking about and why can they get away with these meaningless generalizations?  I mean, really, can music be described as ""Black"" if Ertegun or Lieber and Stoller wrote the lyrics.  Another reviewer noted the way in which Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler dealt with Stax Records.  These men were not altruists driven by a love of music as the film claims, they were opportunists.  The best part of the film is the short clip of Aretha in the studio back in '60s, you catch a glimpse of Tommy Cogbill, Jimmy Johnson and Roger Hawkins (the Muscle Shoals Studio musicians) laying down the groove.  Does it get any better than Aretha and The Swampers?  I wish I could have seen more.  Instead, we're given an extra large helping of Phil Collins and narrator Bette Midler!  Need I say more?",1265673600,11,1251,4.695852534562212

2828013,3,B000PSJDQ4,"What group had 3 number 1 hits and 6 top tens on the Atlantic label from 1966-1968 and no mention on the dvd. What group was not even mentioned in the book ""Music Man"" by Wade & Picardie as evidenced by non inclusion in the index. What group gave you ""Good Lovin'"", ""Groovin'"" and ""People got to be Free"" all # 1 hits for Atlantic.
I grew up partying to their songs and remember seeing the almighty Atlantic label on those old 45's.
Give up?--The Young Rascals later to be The Rascals.
For those too young to remember the group, just pick up any Rascals greatest hits cd. Oh, 45's were these very small discs larger than cd's with big center holes but smaller than 33's.
Forget it, this is not a musical history lesson, just wish the Rascals were included on the dvd.
Nuff said!",1241827200,4,778,4.335616438356165
2828014,5,B000PSJDQ4,"Who would ever believe it?  In 1947 financed with a $10,000 loan from his dentist, Ahmet Ertegun, an immigrant of Turkish descent, and his friend Herb Abramson founded Atlantic records.  Ahmet's goal was to record the rich variety of black music that was just bubbling to the surface in those halcyon days.  Ahmed Ertegun was a connossuer of this music and he firmly believed that he was the guy to introduce it to general audiences.  ""Atlantic Records 60:  The House That Ahmet Built"" tells the remarkable story of Atlantic Records and the man who founded it and led it for nearly six decades.

Now back in the late 1940's there were tons of independent labels operating in the U.S.  Many were fly by night operations that never amounted to much of anything while others managed to produce a few hits before either being bought out or folding altogether  What  the people at Atlantic records were able to achieve was clearly the exception to the rule and the man who made all the difference was Ahmet Ertegun.  Ahmet knew talent when he saw it and consequently over the years he managed to surround himself with an extremely gifted team that helped him to grow the label.  Among those in the inner circle at Atlantic  was Ahmet's brother Nesuhi Ertegun who handled the jazz division in the early days of the label and Jerry Wexler who would play a major role in securing talent for the label for decades.  Talented engineer Tom Dowd also came aboard early on and was responsible for producing some of the greatest jazz and r & b sides ever made.

And I would be remiss if I failed to mention the legendary songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who would pen more than 150 hit records over these years, most of them at Atlantic. The roster of artists who recorded for Atlantic over the years reads like a who's who of popular music.  From Ruth Brown, The Clovers and Ray Charles in the label's earliest days to the likes of Bobby Darin, Sonny and Cher, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Phil Collins and Bette Midler, Atlantic records clearly had it's finger on the pulse of what audiences wanted to hear.

""Atlantic Records 60:  The House That Ahmet Built"" chronicles the remarkable story of this venerable label.  Unfortunately, we lost Ahmet Ertegun back in 2006.  When you discover how he died you will think it quite appropriate indeed.  For Ahmet Ertegun was able to spend his entire adult life doing what he loved best.  It is a compelling story.  Very highly recommended!",1230768000,,2491,4.665137614678899
2828015,5,B000PSJDQ4,"For those individuals who like to look beyond the music and see who really made the music happen, this video is a must see.  It reveals a ""who's who"" of the music industry with all the comments from the signature artists of Atlantic Records.  One glaring absence, in my opinion, was an appearance by or any comments from the (Young) Rascals, one of my all time favorite Atlantic groups.  (Perhaps an ugly contract disagreement at the end of their careers?  Just my guess...)

From a corporate point of view, the film reveals very astute business decisions to continue to re-invent the company as musical tastes changed over time.  From Ahmet's early love of Black musicians and jazz, to the British invasion sounds of the Stones, Led Zep, and Emerson/Lake & Palmer, he obviously could see the future and where the money was to be made.

Readers of this review should also be interested in viewing ""The Language of Music: the Tom Dowd Story"".  Tom was one of the top producers/engineers for Atlantic Records during its hey-day.  A friend of mine here in South Florida had the privelege of working with Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami the night Derek & the Dominos recorded ""Layla"".  He said Dowd was so taken by the magic of the session that he (my friend) was left to operate the board!  No pressure!

These two DVDs, when considered together, give the viewer a quality insight into the ""behind the scenes"" aspects of the music industry as it unfolded at Atlantic.  If you love the music of the 60's, then you will definitely enjoy both videos.",1225324800,5,1546,4.681481481481481
2828016,5,B000PSJDQ4,"Because nobody would believe the movie - it would be too implausible from the start: Son of Turkish Diplomat enters American pop music culture and ands up being the major force behind from Charlie Mingus, Miles Coltrane, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, to the The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Cream; Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young; The Who, AC/DC and everybody else who mattered. And 50 even 60 years later still mattered.

If how Rock and Roll came to be has the slightest fascination for you , you must own this.  And if nothing else, it makes a great pre-show video for your next concert DVD.",1223337600,,595,4.711538461538462
2828017,5,B000PSJDQ4,"While the talent discoveries of executive music industry luminaries such as Berry Gordy and Clive Davis have been celebrated in the media and lionized in pop music history, Ahmet is perhaps the greatest (in terms of significant artists signed) A&R man the industry has ever known.

Discovering John Mingus, John Coltrane, Wynton Marsalis, the Clovers, the Coasters, the Drifters, Ben E. King, Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Bobby Darin, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Roberta Flack, Eric Clapton, Chic, and Kid Rock. He was also instrumental in galvanizing the careers of Booker T. and the MGs, Aretha Franklin, Phil Collins, and Bette Midler - to name a few.

His story, primarily told by Ahmet himself with the help of many of the aforementioned artists, chronlogically documents his life using excerpts of archived footage. It poignantly takes you from the beginning of his journey as the son of a Turkish amabassador, to entrepreneurial owner of his own thriving independent label, to revamped executive at Time Warner owned Atlantic.

Ahmet, who created the Rhythm & Blues Foundation, is the only industry veteran to publicly acknowledge and properly credit black music, in addition to instigating the first financial reparations to black artists for misleading industry practices. He becomes more endearing and engaging the longer this DVD plays on. His should be remembered for how he used his talent to cultivate talent, follow his dreams with tenacity, and inspire others to do the same.

2828018,3,B000PSJDQ4,"Interesting, yet incomplete biography on Atlantic's history, but it needs to be noted that the distribution arrangement that Stax entered with Atlantic has a very dark side to it that is played down.  Ertegun and Wexler destroyed Stax with a shady distribution contract that robbed Stax of their masters and left the label with nothing in their catalog! Stax later recovered by sheer force of will, thanks to the artists and the vision of Al Bell.  Watch 'Respect Yourself: The Stax Records Story' to balance out the 'Ahmet story'.",1208476800,9,531,4.955056179775281
