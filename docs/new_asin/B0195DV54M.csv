What's distracting for me is that Henry Cavill just looks and sounds too much like Clark Kent here, so you're half expecting him to turn into Superman. That might have been an improvement.",1486425600,,255,4.565217391304348
7563048,5,B0195DV54M,"BETTER THAN YOU THINK!  This really was an underappreciated movie. It's got action, humor, it's well acted, well shot and well directed (by Guy Ritchie) and it has a well thought out plot with nice twists throughout the film (thanks to writer, Guy Ritchie).  Unfortunately, it only did about $45 million domestically, on a production budget of $75 million.  World-wide it made money, raking in about $100 million.  Sadly it won't likely get a squeal, but it deserves one!  This really could've been a franchise.  I can't say why it didn't do better at the box office. May be throw-back feel, maybe the competition at the box office it's opening week (Straight Outta Compton). It's a good movie.  Don't be afraid to watch it a few times, to catch all the nuance.",1482710400,,761,4.71969696969697
7563049,5,B0195DV54M,"this is a awesome movie. this is one of the best spy movies I've seen in a while. wouldn't it be cool if they did a man from uncle, james bond and mission impossible crossover. that would be sweet. the acting in this movie is great and the story is good and the action is good. now that I've seen the movie now I want to see the tv show. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1457827200,,393,3.8048780487804876

8744013,5,B0195DV54M,"I had to watch this twice as it's complex compared to most movies - there are 'flashbacks' that explain what is going on, although it's meant to move fast as you are dealing with two individuals who are at the top of their game, so they can't slow it down for the audience. Plus you have to pay attention to the sub-characters as no one is who they seem they are. The first time I missed a lot. I can't stand most movies, so don't watch too many - the last good one I saw was the Chris Pratt Jurassic Park - it was similar to this, lots of clever lines. It's actually funny as hell, too, if you listen to the lines. The 'making-of' extra was really interesting, it's amazing how much goes into a 10-second scene. The three leads had some of the best chemistry I've ever seen in film and the Superman guy is utterly wasted in every other film he's ever been in, as he should be playing Napoleon Solo or James Bond, or someone with a sense of humor not that Super-Stick-In-The-Mud they usually have him playing. Armie Hammer (relative of the famous industrialist who, I think, makes Arm & Hammer products) was good in this although I've never seen him in anything else, but Guy Richie is a fantastic director if only for the cleverness and the great song selection, okay, and the plot twists...man, Madonna was way outclassed by this guy, she was a fool to dump him. If this didn't do well enough for a sequel (which it apparently didn't) it's because it's too smart for most film viewers that can't follow complex plots (like me, again, had to watch it twice and it's was much better the second time. On a scale from Every Bond Movie I've Ever Seen those are all a five or six compared to this solid 10 - Cheers.",1520812800,,1711,4.316770186335404

8744015,5,B0195DV54M,"Irreverent, funny, fast-paced action film.  I did not see the original series, but enjoyed watching this movie on a Jet Blue flight - great characters, great chemistry and a plot that is just far-fetched enough to make the whole vintage-thriller gambit work, but not too much to be irretrievably campy.  Vikander and Hammer are excellent, and Henry Cavill does his best ""To Catch a Thief""-era Cary Grant (and succeeds).  Absolutely loved it.",1517097600,,441,5.097222222222222
8744016,5,B0195DV54M,"I have seen a lot of movies and I hate to admit it but sometimes I can be the type of person to dissect a film and think I could do better when I actually probably couldn't. However, I do not write review about things often or ever at all really so the fact I'm taking out the time to write this is a good sign this was a good movie. In fact, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is easily the best movie I have ever seen and there is not a single thing I would change if I could. Everything about it is phenomenal and after watching it the first time (yes I've seen it more than once), I found every scene to be extremely memorable and fun to watch over. Everything from the brilliant acting and choreography to the interplay between characters is done flawlessly and I think everybody should see this move. Here's to hoping they make a sequel one day.",1514246400,,840,4.159509202453988

8744020,1,B0195DV54M,"I have discovered a cure for insomnia, simply watch this dull waste of celluloid. It is trying to be so cool that it gives new meaning to the word sterile. A disgrace to the memory of the TV show. The 2 lead actors, Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer have as much charisma as a pair of mannequins used in a department store and as for the 2 female actresses Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki, well they could always pick up work in Madame Tussards Wax Works! I smelt a rat when I saw the coma inducing trailer for this plodding dogs breakfast, I should have saved my money, I could have watched paint dry and it would have been just as interesting!",1498435200,,647,4.311475409836065
