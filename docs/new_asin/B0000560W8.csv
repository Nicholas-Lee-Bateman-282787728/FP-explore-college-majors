8324666,1,B0000560W8,"In the video, you will find just 3 exercises.
1) Rotating eyeball
2) Rotating neck
3) Tracking an object with your eyes
You can do the exercises (1) and (2) without watching the video. You just rotate your eyeball and neck. That's it.
The video is also useless for the exercise (3). It just displays a small dot moving on the TV screen and you track it with your eyes. Nothing more. Moreover, since it is a video on TV screen, the displays are very flickering so the exercise (3) will only give you eye strain.",1077321600,,510,4.322916666666667
8324667,5,B0000560W8,"My eyesight started getting bad a few years ago.  I am about to enter my 40's and I did not want to get glasses.  This video has been a real blessing.
I considered lazer surgery, but I was afraid of the risks and cost.  I had heard about the Bates Method, and I looked at several different products.  This video was the only one with eye exercises and video graphics, and the price is really affordable.
I completed the program in just 4 weeks, and had immediate results.  I am seeing as clearly as I ever could.  I feel like a kid again!  Speaking of which, my young son wears glasses.  I've started him on the program and he is already seeing positive results.  It will be great for him to be able to go through life without glasses.
I have only one piece of advice: Buy this video!",1068076800,3,784,4.208053691275167
