7425882,5,B0152AW2U8,"This series shows the side of the Confederate as well as the Union, during the time near the end of the Civil War, in a building that was made into a hospital. The scenes are realistic for what the war might have truly been.  More so than any other depiction I've seen. Includes graphic views of medical problems, varied personalities and relationships, with people from each side, with different motivations. Includes many depictions of how African Americans likely felt, as well as what Confederate soldiers went through.",1454198400,9,523,5.011494252873563
7425883,5,B0152AW2U8,"I love this intelligent, gritty and accessible show.  I saw the previews right before Downton Abbey was to start (which I love) and was intrigued by the American Civil War setting.  It is a great series (so far) and really shows the horrors of war, not to mention the circumstances in which hospitals had to run.  It also has Josh Radnor, which is even better! I thought PBS couldn't do any better, but they've proved that wrong.",1454198400,11,429,4.545454545454546
7425884,5,B0152AW2U8,Excellent new series.  Lots to chew on.  Emotional and smart.  Can't wait to see them all.,1453680000,2,90,4.5
7425885,3,B0152AW2U8,My complaint is that some scenes are filmed in near total darkness so that it is impossible to see what's going on.,1453680000,6,115,4.2727272727272725
7425886,5,B0152AW2U8,"Though the BD and DVD of this series will not be available until February 2, 2016, as a journalist, I was provided an advance screener in exchange for an objective review of the production and the bonus features on the Bluray and DVD versions. Because the series is still running I will not provide ant spoilers (I hate spoilers) nor give too many details. Youll enjoy the series more, the less you know  except for some certain warnings  which will NOT divulge the plot details.

This six-part series was developed by PBS  and executive-produced by Director Ridley Scott to show that US mini-series can rival the quality of BBC series like Downton Abbey.  The story takes place in Alexandria, VA in 1862  at the height of the Civil War. Alexandria is right on the border of the North and the South and is the base for the Union hospital  where some Confederates are treated as well.  Like the BBC dramas (like DA) this is a place where all classes come together in one building. There are soldiers from the North and South, doctors who are thrown into saving their enemies, free black men as well as slaves, and society matrons who find that war is hell. There are even a few moments that will remind you of Roots. There is some of the direct rawness of M*A*S*H (Robert Altmans FILM version, not Larry Gelbarts TV comedy), though this war was a hundred years earlier.

While the conflict between the sides (north vs. south; black vs. whites; rich vs. poor) runs through the series, there is a lot of surgery being practiced here and it is some of the most graphic and grisly images that I remember seeing in a long while. The BD/DVD is the Original UK Version and is not edited so Im not sure what is being shown on PBS is ( I have not seen it there), but I do want to warn those with weak stomachs for blood, skin and bones to be aware of this. There is also some graphic language.

The series consists of six episodes, Each running just over 53 minutes each.

The BD has English subtitles and about 30 minutes of bonuses. In addition to a number of deleted scenes (one lasts eight minutes; the others much shorter) there are short (2-3 minute) featurettes about Historical Accuracy, the background on two characters and the southern family that is housing the northern troops, and the cast. Some (not all) of these can be seen on the PBS website.

The acting is excellent, the script well done (though some often -used  clichs are there too). If you miss it on PBS  and are prepared for the violent images, I think youll like this.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

time depicted as well as the back and white beliefs of most folks of the time.  I was glad to see Mary Elizabeth Winstead in one of the leading roles as I think she is a very unappreciated actor who has shined in a variety of roles.  I am looking forward to part 2.",1453248000,2,407,4.0

7426009,4,B0152AW2U8,"Mercy Street is an American period medical drama television series created by Lisa Wolfinger and David Zabel. It is set during the Civil War and follows two volunteer nurses from opposing sides who work at the Mansion House Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia. I missed Mercy Street's first season and when I saw the preview of the upcoming second it looked interesting enough to make a small investment so I could watch the series from the beginning.  There are six episodes in the first season and I enjoyed them all and have kept up with the new season, looking forward to each episode.  There is blood and gore in a few scenes: Not for the squeamish. Lots of drama and intrigue along with a sprinkling bit of humor.  The costuming is very authentic as are the scene settings.  This series certainly is no Downton Abby but enjoyable nonetheless.  With the graphic hospital scenes I wouldn't recommend this series be viewed by small children.",1487203200,2,941,4.783950617283951

7426014,2,B0152AW2U8,"I tried to like this series. I watched all the first season episodes. Only my opinion of course, but I could not separate the actors from their previous characters. Mary Winstead played an alcoholic teacher who started using crack. Josh Rador played a millennial slacker who suddenly finds himself raising an orphan who is more mature than his to-be foster father. Although I am used to being able to visualize individuals in drastically different character roles, Josh Radnor and Mary Winstead are not skilled enough actors to make this historical drama real for me. AnnaSophia Robb was Carrie Bradshaw for Pete's sake. There are no actors in this ensemble that are able to make realistic this period drama. Hate to say it, but they should have used some British actors faking American accents. I would have taken them more seriously.",1485820800,,835,4.9714285714285715

7426040,1,B0152AW2U8,"This story does not measure up to shows like Downton Abbey. There is nothing new here. It is cliched ad nauseam. A typical episode features non-stop petty conflicts between the characters including pompous speeches, backbiting, spite, turf battles etc. We've seen it all before. Furthermore, each of these nasty interactions are too short-lived to be developed deeply and there are simply too many of them in each episode - the black girl abused by the obnoxious white supervisor; the haughty new nurse; the spy; the sweating doctor amputating a leg; the delirious  patient; the kindly young pastor; the Catholic nun; the condescending Union officers; the privileged Southern family trying to find their place; the competent but humble black orderly; the earthy Irish matron; the nasty slave bounty hunters....followed by the abused back girl, the obnoxious white supervisor........get it? And unless you are a medical professional the graphic procedures are of little interest. The acting is forced and second rate. Absolute torture to
watch.",1482019200,2,1043,5.398773006134969

7426204,5,B0152AW2U8,"Mercy Street's aim is to show the viewer what it was like in a military hospital, this a Union hospital, in occupied Alexandria, VA. Two of the three running themes are the Confederacy's citizens in war and the hospital itself. Mercy Street, according to dialog in the fifth (of six) episodes stems from the road leading from the docks to the hospital. This hospital, although governed by the Union, also has Confederate soldiers. Depending on the doctor or nurse, either Union soldiers are given preferential treatment or soldiers from both sides given equal treatment. The third running theme is repatriation of torn apart former slave families.

This is riveting television and makes for fantastic viewing. Had I still been involved in teaching U.S. history to high school students, I would easily add this to my section of the Civil War. Not only does this humanize the war and suffering but it thoughtfully teaches along the way. Both my wife and I would watch an episode each day with our morning coffee before we began getting ready for work. (We actually got up a bit earlier so that we would have time to do so.)

7426230,5,B0152AW2U8,"Yankees and Confederates are forced to come together at a Civil War hospital in Alexandria, Virginia.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as Mary Phinney, a young widow from New England who travels to the Union-occupied Mansion Hospital to serve as head nurse. She immediately encounters chaotic conditions in which too many young men needing desperate medical help vie for the attention of too few doctors and nurses. There aren't enough supplies and the diet is too meager to encourage recuperation. Right off, Mary sees she has her work cut out for her.

Meanwhile, doctors Jed Foster (Josh Radnor) and Byron Hale (Norbert Leo Butz) clash on the best medical techniques; eldest daughter of the former hotel owners Emma Green (Hannah James) is torn between hating the Yankees who stole her family's hotel and wanting to be involved in nursing; former slave Aurelia Johnson (Shalita Grant) is hiding a terrible secret as she desperately tries to locate her son; and free black man/former physician's assistant Samuel Diggs (McKinley Belcher III) simultaneously years to be more than just a supply assistant at the hospital.

Each episode contains the continuing struggles of numerous characters; there is no simple resolution at the end of the hour. Yet each episode also contains hope that each person's individual storylines will be favorably resolved as viewers learn more and get to know what makes them tick.

Although the first season only contained six episodes, they were richly written and acted. As Mercy Street has already been renewed for season two, viewers may look forward to learning more about the characters and Mansion Hospital.",1463011200,,1643,5.188679245283019

Product good quality. Show is great (and I don't particularly care for the Civil War era). If your a civil war buff this show provides the ""other side"" of the conflicts.",1456531200,,334,4.075757575757576

1862 Civil War non-front activity in the Alexandria Union Hospital operating in the conscripted Mansion House Hotel owned by the elite Southern Green family. The colloquial name given to the road leading to the hospital was Mercy Street given for the soldiers hope that they might be saved. Doctors/nurses aided all wounded, North or South, which for some was a moral conflict. Many story lines are involving a wide collection of extremely well developed characters. Some find the war based on emancipation, some union preservation, & others on southern lifestyle. Differences clash.
SUBTITLES available for feature episodes and all bonus.

1==Kudos for detailed sets and props (including fake repainted Halloween body parts obtained via eBay).
2==Award-level performance of cast members who were obviously selected for acting ability, not for name recognition. Not the A list, but nearly all give perhaps the performance of their life making this series feel realistic. Emotionally gripping.
3==Historical accuracy.
4==Cinematography brilliant.
5==A screenwriting magical wonder.
6==Bonus: lots of it, all good, includes SUBTITLES for bonus.
Adds up to 6 STARS WORTHY.

WHAT ABOUT THE GORE? Its over-hyped. Do not turn away from this magnificent drama presentation because they, and an early reviewer shouted overbearing war gore. One scene in episode 3 of a leg amputation is acknowledged as ripe but the rest is no different than top contemporary police murder crime series from the US, UK, Aussie, etc. Not as much as Anzac Girls and War Horse, both much recommended WWI depictions. Barely a fraction of the gore in Saving Private Ryan and The Passion of the Christ. Those dramas received press coverage due to excessive gore, perhaps a ploy intended for this series by Mkt Dept. & the first reviewer via a review-obligated freebee. I bought my DVD at a brick-n-mortar Local-Mart.
Im no Civil War expert, but I watch and read much surrounding it. This seems as realistic as any fictional drama Ive crossed paths with.
I highly recommend it. Fast-forward through the one amputation and you should be good-to-go.",1456272000,12,2151,5.231884057971015

7426452,2,B0152AW2U8,"Even aside from the erroneous assertion the Civil War was fought exclusively over the peculiar institution, the show is poorly executed, and if you are going to show rape, the story better be extremely compelling otherwise, which it isn't.

I'm dumbfounded why the BBC can produce outstanding drama like Ripper Street, but our native PBS produces crap like Mercy Street.",1454976000,10,370,5.166666666666667
7426453,5,B0152AW2U8,"Caught Episode 1 quite by accident after DA and I have to say I was hooked right away. The fact is that anything to do with OUR civil war and that time period has always fascinated me. Besides being, arguably, the most important event in this nation's history, I can't even imagine the human conflict that some of these people endured. This war not only threatened to tear this country apart but families as well. This is now become appointment viewing for my Sunday evenings.  A warning to DA fans though. This series is not for the faint of heart.",1454284800,13,549,4.49
