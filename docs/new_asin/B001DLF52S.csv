3534570,2,B001DLF52S,"A rather run-of-the-mill European western in my view, not much happens story-wise to set it apart from any number of spaghetti westerns you may have seen. The overall package is nicely done with the artwork and a couple of decent ""extras"" to watch. If your a fan of this type of western I can't imagine this film will blow you away but I would guess one would find it enjoyable enough. I might suggest waiting for a drop in price, I paid around thirty dollars for it but I don't feel the overall quality of this film justifies the cost.....?",1454371200,,541,4.42

Its hard to believe these days that westerns were once a hit making genre when it came to movies in theaters. They were a mainstay for so long, faded a touch and then in the sixties were reinvigorated when a group of Italian and French directors began making westerns their way in tribute to the ones they grew up with. Film fans are already aware of Sergio Leone for his Man With No Name series of films but the rest for the most part were a footnote in the history of film. But they're being rediscovered and DVD companies like Arrow are helping that rediscovery along with releases of some great Italian westerns, more commonly referred to as Spaghetti Westerns, made by other directors.

CEMETARY WITHOUT CROSSES isn't found in the imdb.com database but THE ROPE AND THE COLT is. Its the same movie but the new release goes by the first name. Directed by and starring French start Robert Hossein the movie takes place in the ever lawless land of the west. When Ben Caine is killed by the Rogers family to take over his land, his widow Maria (Michele Mercer) seeks revenge. The one man she can count on to help her is past love Manuel (Hossein). Living alone in a ghost town, Maria reaches out to him to be her angel of vengeance. He may deny her request but we know he will follow through.

To do so Manuel endears himself to the Rogers family by saving the lives of several brothers during a gun fight at the local saloon. They take him home and hes offered a job as a ranch hand. This leads to an unusual but fun sequence involving the entire family and staff sitting down to eat what has to be the noisiest dinner ever filmed. It leads you one way then turns a different direction before it finishes. In the extras Hossein lets it be known that this sequence was shot by Sergio Leone who was a friend.

Manual eventually draws out the Rogers family from their ranch and while they're away kidnaps the only daughter of Mr. Rogers. Taking her to the ghost town she is brutalized by Marias two ranch hands before they leave only to be captured by the Rogers family. In return for their lives they agree to get the daughter and return her home. But all never goes according to plan in movies like this.

The story seems fairly simple and indeed it is. But thats part of the beauty of it all. It doesnt need tons of extras or a huge plot to make it an interesting film that has you guessing from start to finish while waiting to see the outcome of the actions of all involved. The story itself is enough, one of revenge for wrongs done. There is no room for doubt as to the endplay of the story but when the dust settles and all grievances are answered for it all fits nicely into place.

The transfer here is done well, especially considering that the odds of finding a mint condition copy of this near 50 year old film is highly unlikely. The movie is offered in both original Italian language and dubbed English. The extras are short for Arrow (who tend to offer quite a bit) but chances are they are all that was available including short interviews and TV reporting on the film.

If you're discovering the spaghetti western and learning just how entertaining they were then by all means pick up a copy of this one for your collection. For western fans youll find much to enjoy here as well. Its a solid movie that entertains and offers just what you would expect from the genre.",1438300800,,3441,4.392464678178964
3534573,4,B001DLF52S,"Made in 1969 by Robert Hossein who directed this and stars as Manuel - a gunman who has lost his will to fight. Then Michele Mercier as Maria Caine turns up and ask for his help; her husband and his friend has been hung by a gang of ranchers who are a notorious family. She wants justice - but her kind and not the sort dished out by a judge.

He then gets embroiled in a kidnap plot and all bets are off as to how this is going to pan out. Now this is dedicated to Sergio Leone who also makes a cameo appearance. It is screamingly sixties in style - with the music as jarring as it is effective. It is all in English but has that seventies Italian feel for sound recording that makes it sound dubbed. The acting is so straight that it seems forced at times; but that belies the very real undercurrents of what is really going on.

Things are communicated without being said and a look can convey emotions that pages written by a bard would leave unmolested. Some have commented that the pacing could have been better; but you need time to take in what is actually happening under the surface and this is the sort of film where you will spot more on subsequent viewings. It is high time someone made a release of this and much plaudits to Arrow for so doing. This is one for fans of the genre and for those who just love a good old western - not made in the West obviously, but not lacking in any way because of it - seriously recommended.",1438041600,,1439,4.154121863799283
3534574,3,B001DLF52S,"Cemetery Without Crosses begins with a lynching  revenge for one of the Caine clan attempting to steal from the Rogers clan. Determined to seek vengeance of her own, the victims widow, Maria (Michele Mercier), seeks out her former fiance, gunslinger Manuel (Robert Hossein). Manuel cares little for the gold she offers or her mission of vengeance, but agrees to help because they once were lovers. The plan: he will kidnap the daughter of the other family.

Much like the Hatfield/McCoy feud, the bad blood between the clans is longstanding, with no end in sight. Both families are portrayed as savages who live by violence.

 For an Italian Western, this film defies expectations. There is violence, but it isn't orchestrated as elaborately as in, say, a Sergio Leone Western. Several sequences have no dialogue, which tends to put the picture on auto pilot. The film enjoys a good reputation among Italian Western aficionados, perhaps because it illustrates how revenge can consume individuals and entrap them in a path to self-destruction. Call it a thinking persons Western.

 Blu-ray extras include a new interview with Robert Hossein; a brief interview excerpt with Hossein from 1968 French TV; original Italian and English soundtracks in uncompressed audio; newly translated English subtitles for the Italian soundtrack; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned art work; and an illustrated collectors booklet.",1437350400,,1436,5.388392857142857
3534575,5,B001DLF52S,"""CEMETARY WITHOUT CROSSES"" (1969) aka ""THE ROPE & THE COLT"" is an extremely appreciated Euro-Western (French/Italian) among those who have viewed it. The film has yet (1/10/2014) to receive an official United States release on DVD or Blu-ray.  It was directed and co-written by its star, Robert Hossein who plays a gunfighter who takes revenge against a wealthy landowner's family who murdered his best friend and husband to his former flame (Michele Mercier) and then gets pulled into a tragic kidnap/murder plot by the former lover. The film is an intriguing and mournful story, with stylish editing and cinematography, moody Spanish-style guitar music (by Robert Hossein's brother, Andre) and a cast of believable actors who convey the story beautifully. I've always found that some of the best moments in Euro-Western films take place with camera, movement, music and very little dialogue. Behavior is universal but language isn't and this film is an outstanding example why these moments are so appealing. Hossein and company manage to tell this simple, direct and menacing story through pictures more than words.  It flourishes with distinctive landscapes, long scenes without conversation, a quiet anti-hero, and an unsuccessful romance.  ""CEMETARY WITHOUT CROSSES is sometimes compared to director, Sergio Corbucci's Euro-Western classic, ""The Great Silence,"" because they are similar in tone.  Released around the same time, both films are moody, minimalist, minor masterpieces which are philosophical in nature and do not have the typical happy ending.  And, that's a good thing.

A couple of trivia facts about this film: The opening theme song, ""Rope and the Colt"" was performed by singer, Scott Walker and became a hit in England.  Also, the legendary Euro-Western director, Sergio Leone has a brief cameo in the film as a hotel desk clerk.  Leone also directed the family dinner scene in the film but went un-credited for the task.",1389312000,,1945,5.312703583061889

3534577,4,B001DLF52S,"Robert Hossein directs, co-writes, stars, and dedicates this film, Cemetery Without Crosses, to Sergio Leone.

A gunfighter, Manuel (Hossien), is hired by his x-love, Maria (Michelle Mercier), to revenge the murder of her husband leading to tragic results for all. Filmed in classic cinematic style: the story is told visually (Cinematography by Henri Persin) with a minimum of dialogue. A rousing music score by Andr Hossein helps to tip the hat to Ennio Morricone and Leone.

If you are a Spaghetti Western fan, see it, for its sly tongue in cheek tribute to this genre. If you are new to this type of film, then let me say Euro-Westerns can be fun and fascinating to watch for their creativity, unexpected plot twists, rustic atmosphere, a cruel reality that mirrors our own, and calculating dark humor, which can lead you to say ""More spaghetti please!""",1297036800,,857,4.944444444444445

8293986,4,B001DLF52S,"Fascinating--as Monsieur Spock might say.  This one is a banner-carrier among its kind.  For one thing, it doesn't classify as the so-called spaghetti western because the two main stars are French! So, uh--what, an escargot western? lol.  It's also interesting in that among the Italian cast is Gina's cousin Guido Lollobrigida, here credited as Lee Burton.  I had no idea the fabulous Italian superstar had a lower-ranking relative in the business.  Then there's the story.  Wow! What I most revel in about European westerns is their original touches, and I think this one may be king in that department.  The hero is a soft-spoken, no-nonsense, and totally believable anti-hero who for me is far superior to the one-dimensional character Clint Eastwood played in his early westerns.  This man lives in a ghost town, first of all.  Before each gunfight, he slips a black glove onto his right hand, then wreaks unbelievable havoc. His prowess with the gun may or may not be believable, but it's an amazing touch which I may have to borrow when I get back to writing western novels.  This character is anything but a Django or a Sabata, but he's impressive nonetheless.  It's true that the pervasively grim chain of events gets a little heavy--the title is certainly brilliantly chosen for this film--but all in all I think far more highly of this than of the bulk of other alternative westerns I've watched--and yes, I've now seen probably a hundred and fifty.  It also has a slam-bang out-of-the-blue ending which surprised me totally, but which on consideration was absolutely appropriate.  Justice has been served, and, well, just about everybody is dead . . . I give it only four stars instead of five because of its slow moments and because here and there the pace is also a little choppy.  A final irony: Robert Hossein dedicates the film at the end to Sergio Leone, yet I wouldn't give more than two stars to any of Leone's mangy, endlessly violent and overrated westerns.  This one is violent, yes, but there is a point and a purpose to it.",1482019200,,2048,4.794871794871795
