Except for that, the star girl is pretty plain, IMHO, a little rough. The other girls are better, much so. The ""acting"", dialogue, etc is about what you would expect.  Pornos have come a long way since this one...so compared to what's out there, I would only buy this one as a collector. I expect the actual quality of your copy will not be too great, since the movie has been re-copied so many times.  Watch your friends copy, spend your own money on something better.",1254700800,,589,4.327272727272727

8593772,5,B00DJ7PYY8,"Deep Throat was made by Director Gerard Damiano.  He had worked on doing adult film loops, and now wanted to try making a full-length feature adult movie.

""Deep Throat"" was an adult sex comedy about a woman played by Linda Love lace whose sex life has no zing to it.  A friend recommends her to this doctor she knows who may be able to help her.  The doctor is played by actor Harry Reams.  He performs an examination and finds that instead of her clitoris being where it should be, it is located at the bottom of her throat.

Grateful for his help, she goes to work for him as a nurse.  The doctor also has another nurse played by actress Carole Connors who went on to the blonde who used to announce host Chuck Barris at the beginning of the ""Gong Show"" on TV.

At the time the movie was made, Coca Cola was airing the commercial that introduced the theme song on it that went on to become a Top Ten Hit during that time, ""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing.""  In the movie, the doctor has a male patient who takes the slogan ""Things go better with Coca Cola"" to a whole new level.  During the scene with this male patient in which he is using Coca Cola, the music from the soundtrack for the scene is a re-worked version of the then popular Coca Cola theme.  It is re-worked so as it sounds vaguely the same, but it is changed enough so that it will not be an infringement on the copyright.

The success of this movie opened the door for more full-length feature adult movies with Gerard Daminiano following up with another full-length feature adult movie in which he wanted to make it more artistic, ""The Devil in Miss Jones.""

A number of years back, Linda Lovelace had come out saying that she was coerced to perform in the ""Deep Throat"" movie.  However, there was no evidence found of this and others who performed with her said that this was not so.

""Deep Throat"" comes across like something comical you might read in an underground comic book that were being published back then in the late 1960's and early 1970's.

I would say that ""Deep Throat"" was a product of its time.  It also has the distinction of being the first successful full-length feature adult movie.  In fact, when it first came out, there used to be people standing on line to go to see this move.  I was a novelty, and back then, it was the in thing to do to go to watch movies like this.  About two years earlier to this, it was the Swedish movie ""I'm Curious Yellow.""

After ""Deep Throat"" and ""The Devil in Miss Jones"" came the Mitchell Brothers movies that both stared the ""Ivory Snow"" girl, Marilyn Chambers, ""Behind the Green Door"" and ""The Resurrection of Eve.""  When word got out of the star in the movie being the same girl that was on the ""Ivory Snow"" box, Ate new and current ""Ivory Snow"" box replaced it.",1239062400,6,2796,4.326295585412668
