8149028,4,B000J3EB6C,"Gay cinema certainly has a place in film history, and I came across the ""Boys Briefs"" series via Netflix. I've seen all but the first, and it's often refreshing to have a narrator to give a glimpse. In #4, ""Ricky"" was only annoying. Just because it was about street hustlers, he pretended to be  ""badder"" than any of the characters portrayed. It was a misgiuded build-up for some sweet stories, and fine films. ""Gold"" was well done, with the most graphic street stuff. ""Boy"" was OK, but there was some bizarre approach that ultimately rang true and satisfying. ""Into the Night"" was fine; the best was ""Build"", written, directed and starring the very attractive Greg Atkins. All of these films are about deception, and, getting past that, the gay life may survive. ""Into the Night"" may be the best depiction of it all. Recommended for the film purists, and, happily, doesn't include the horrors that real street hustlers face on a daily basis.",1272931200,,942,4.779141104294479

8149031,4,B000J3EB6C,"BOYS BRIEFS 4 consists of six short films that are all about hustlers. Each of them, some more successfully than others, attempts to delve into the psyches of these men; and for the subject matter they are remarkably free of much sex with the exception of the last film ""Gold"" which is directed by Armen Kazazian. The remaining five in the order presented are ""Into The Night"", directed by Tony Krawitz; ""Boy"" (Welby Ings), ""Gigolo"" (Bastian Schweitzer), ""Build"" (Greg Atkins), and ""Rock Bottom"" directed by Mary Feur.

As one would expect from such a collection, some of these films are better than others. ""Boy"" from New Zealand has some beautiful photography, for instance; some of the frames would be suitable for framing and are reminiscent of the less provative photography of Joel Peter Witkin. There are lots of sepia tones. On the other hand, this one is a silent film. I am willing to bet that you'll be hard put to know what you were supposed to take away from the film, once you have seen it. In accompanying commentary, the director, who is eminently likeable, says that the film got a couple of bad reviews at first but then went on to win awards. If I had world enough and time, I would watch it again. But I don't and I didn't. Then I would put ""Gigolo"" (French) and ""Into the Night"" (Australian) in the Gentleman's C Category, with the last three having the most going for them. (Perhaps, however, I was just warming up to the subject matter. That is a possibility.) ""In the Canadian film ""Build"" a hustler living with and supporting an alcoholic mother moves in a hustler friend with some interesting complicatins. In ""Rock Bottom"" U. S.) an overweight man picks up a crack addict. The danger involved with such an arrangement is palpable. The ending may surprise you. Finally ""Grace"" (also American) is about a young hustler who takes care of a blind, older ex-hustler. Besides having the best money shot, the scenes between the two men are quite moving at times. These directors, all of them, should be encouraged to do feature films, if they haven't already done so.

Now to Ricky"" who introduces each film and describes himself as a hustler as well. He adds nothing to the film; he is actually a distraction and appears to have wondered in from some bad porn movie. He should have continued doing whatever he was engaged in and have left well enough alone.",1213920000,3,2378,4.673031026252984
8149032,4,B000J3EB6C,"""Picture This!"" continues their practice of grouping gay shorts by subject, in this six film compilation about male hustlers and their customers.  Similar to ""Boys Briefs 3"", viewers have the option of viewing each short separately, or seeing them all in sequence introduced by (in this case) ""Sexy hustler host Ricky."" (I'd pass on the latter.) DVD includes director commentary on five of the shorts, most of them made just for this DVD, a practice I hope they continue.

The shorts - rated individually - are:

""Into the Night"" (Australia 2002) deals with the need for companionship, as a lonely older man hires a street boy mostly for company, and also portrays a much younger boy just entering street life.  4 stars out of 5.

""Boy"" (New Zealand 2004) is about a young hustler who learns the truth about the death of a young woman in a small town, and has to fight for his life when the town wants him silenced. If you are partial to eclectic  films with choppy short scenes (there were well over a hundred of them, averaging - according to the director - less than three seconds each, utilizing 47 credited actors, in a film that is only 15 minutes long!), you may like this more than I did.  In the director commentary, he admits that the scenes are generally too short for people to realize what they just saw.  Call me crazy, but I believe intentionally confusing the audience isn't a wise move.  1 star out of 5.

The ""Gigolo"" (German 2005) is a bisexual druggie hustler working the better addresses of the streets of Paris.  Well done.  4 stars out of 5.

""Build"" (Canada 2004) features a college student who quits his studies and turns to hustling to financially support himself and his alcoholic mother.  Lead character is played by Writer/Director Greg Atkins.  Gritty, well acted and touching.  4 stars out of 5.

When you hit ""Rock Bottom"" (2002), the only way to go is up.  Socially backward man (played by co-author of the screenplay) is wary of picking up a teenage street hustler, while the young man is most concerned about keeping the man at a figurative distance.  They find a common bond under unexpected circumstances. 4 stars out of 5.

""Gold"" (Canada 2005) is the color of the hearts of both a young hustler and an aging blind artist who hires him as a caretaker and protg.  Very touching and realistic.  5 stars out of 5.",1165968000,16,2348,4.607228915662651
