The videos are introductory, so if you already know the basics, perhaps they are not for you.  Don't pay attention to the criticism of those who weren't smart enough to read the description and look for more information about the videos from the internet or the instructors' website. The videos are clearly labeled basic.  That's why they are titled ""A Taste of....""

I gave it four stars because even though the intent is to make the tapes universal by making them bilingual, it does tend to slow the lessons a bit.  Why not use subtitles for the alternate language?",1120608000,,707,4.535433070866142
7928422,5,B00004ZD4X,"Excellent video. The teachers explain each step in English and Spanish which increases the number of people who can learn Salsa. The information is very clear and the steps are very easy to repeat and follow. It is very important the signaling system developed by the dancers: how the leader indicates to the follower when they are going to iniciate a turn or will change the step.  The music is very appropiate and the dancers are very skilled. If you and your partner can learn all these basic steps, you can develop later some other fancy movements by your own, and transform yourself in a very good salsa dancer. This means that you can build up new movements based on the steps presented here. I tried it and it work wery well for me and my partner.",1005177600,2,754,4.5036496350364965
7928423,2,B00004ZD4X,This video is for absolute beginners. It only teaches a couple of moves. Each move is taught in English then is repeated almost word for word in Spanish. After you watch them teach a simple move over & over in one language you do not want to watch the moves repeated over & over in other language. It soon got very boring. I do not think much of the skill of the teachers either. There are better Salsa instructional videos being sold on Amazon. The only good point in this video is that it teaches all the moves in Spanish as well as English.,992304000,2,543,4.230769230769231
