7323660,5,B0112HPTBE,I think part 2 is the best but in this set you get all 3 films uncut. Now I can finally watch all the centipedes back to back to make one long centipede the way Tom Six intended!!!,1438646400,7,180,3.763157894736842
7323661,5,B0112HPTBE,Very nice collection of all the Human Centipede movies. Tons of extras and even Human Centipede 2 in color! I would highly recommend to fans of this series. Great HD picture and sound as well.,1459987200,2,192,4.514285714285714

7323663,5,B0112HPTBE,I had to own this collection. Part one is the best one... the last two were too cheesy.,1453334400,,87,3.888888888888889
7323664,5,B0112HPTBE,"Awesome box set! Part 2 has a color version included, so you can watch the original b&w version or a color one.",1448928000,13,111,4.090909090909091
7323665,3,B0112HPTBE,This was a great value but as the movies go good to awful with 3 being so bad why or how did it get funded !,1446768000,3,108,3.1923076923076925
7323666,1,B0112HPTBE,I am very disappointed because no closed captioning with the color version of film. I'm pissed off! I need CC,1446163200,4,109,4.5
7323667,5,B0112HPTBE,Is this a multi region bluray? Will it play in the UK?,1446163200,,54,3.5833333333333335
7323668,5,B0112HPTBE,"It arrived on time and none of the discs are scratched. As for the movies, they play very well and look amazingly disgusting. I'm very happy :)",1446076800,17,143,4.333333333333333
7323669,3,B0112HPTBE,Right now this thing is too expensive. I mean 59.99?? Nobody will pay that much for these films. I will only buy if the price drops.,1441065600,4,132,4.115384615384615
7323670,5,B0112HPTBE,Awesome series....no reason to be a hater.  The stand alone blu-rays all come in unrated cut.  Don't believe they were even released edited.  Don't know where the previous reviewer got that from,1438732800,6,194,5.0
8723549,5,B0112HPTBE,"The Human Centipede. The most horrifying Films I ever watched. It is what it says - the complete Package with all 3.
Includes the color Version of The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence.
Import to germany worked without any Problems - shipped from the U.S. and arrived with DPD.
Does not play on Blu-Ray Systems in Germany due to the ""Region Code"" - can play on a PC with a different Region-Code.",1528156800,,394,4.486111111111111
8723550,5,B0112HPTBE,"All 3 movies are awesome, I like that there's a color version of part 2 and Dieter Laser had me laughing so hard in part 3. He reminds me of myself when I watch the news.",1519257600,,170,3.75

8723554,5,B0112HPTBE,"It's an amazing movie , the color version is completly Sick and makes the movie more heavy than usual...

And one more thing...
I gueess i'm the first brazilian with this Blu ray !",1484179200,2,277,4.054545454545455
8723555,5,B0112HPTBE,delivered on time and as described.,1473120000,,35,5.0
8723556,5,B0112HPTBE,"This review is for the product, not the films themselves. This is a great bluray collection, with each disk loaded with added features not on the original blurays, a stylish box art, and essential for fans of the series. All three films in one great collection.",1470268800,,261,4.695652173913044
8723557,3,B0112HPTBE,"If you liked the first two films, then as a completist you are bound to want to see the last one. I would never be one to recommend not seeing a film, even an awful one, as I find much to admire in even the worst attempts at cinema, but I will warn you, even by the decidedly low standards of art and good taste proffered by the first two, THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 3 [FINAL SEQUENCE] is practically unwatchable.

I don't care to go into much detail, but the lead performance by German actor Dieter Laser is so unhinged and cringe-inducing (in the worst possible ways) it ruins the very little that this movie had to offer. I was also very disturbed by the heinous sexual degradation visited upon the sole female in the film, not as a character but as an actress.

I sold my individual blu-rays of the first two films so I could purchase this, and I almost regret it. I am very much a completist and I always collect entire series, even the films I don't care for, so the purchase works out for me. If you are not like me, however, save your money. At least rent Part 3 before you buy it.",1466208000,10,1082,4.197115384615385
8723558,5,B0112HPTBE,"A Great collection of these horrible movies with tons of extras, in a nice neat package.

I would like to point out that the case states that the collection contains unrated director's cuts of only the first two films, However all three discs in the set are director's cut editions of the films.",1465344000,3,295,4.566037735849057
