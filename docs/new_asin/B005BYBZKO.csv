4650013,5,B005BYBZKO,"Although made by the fine folks behind Masters of the Universe and Bravestarr the show has a different style of animation than it's better known Filmation siblings.

4650016,5,B005BYBZKO,"I remember on Saturdays and Sundays on I think CBS, they use to air this show. Back in the early 80s, Filmation did for the small screen what Walt Disney did for the movies. Filmation would go on to be famous for the first He-man series before it was surpassed by Ruby Spears and Sunbow. Great classic.",1371254400,3,302,4.315789473684211

4650021,5,B005BYBZKO,"I love all things Zorro, that live up to the greatness of El Zorro, and New Adventures of Zorro is a great dvd. Would like to get Vol. 2 new, of The New Adventures Of The Lone Ranger And Zorro(different dvd from this one), when and if the price is appropriate(any out there?).They do not make animated gems like this any more or classics for that matter. Please bring back great story telling, like those days of yesteryear.",1341705600,8,424,4.448717948717949

8464618,5,B005BYBZKO,"Fantastic value on the ""rare"" 1981-82 Filmation Saturday morning series, shown originally in tandem with the Lone Ranger and Tarzan as the Lone Ranger/Tarzan/Zorro Adventure Hour. Even better is that you get ALL 13 remastered episodes (the complete series) for one low price. The episodes look fantastic, as they have been remastered, and the video is very clean with little to no artifacts. A MUST if you are a Zorro, Filmation fan, or just want to relive the best of Saturday mornings!",1390348800,12,487,4.951219512195122
