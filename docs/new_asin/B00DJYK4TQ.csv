I mean the events that take place were just as cheesy as you can get. Pens and pencils falling from above, chair moves, table moves, glass moves and a piece of Styrofoam moves and even as lame as that all sounds it gets worse. All this stuff takes place with either their hands on these objects "" so the poltergeist can use the energy"" or it happens from these camera angles that they claim is so you can see its not fake when in fact makes it that much more suspect cause you don't see nothin that makes you think for even a second that makes you think any of it is real at all. I mean this all takes place in the middle of the day, no back story at all, no one ever reacts nervous or scared, and then at the end he supossedly sees a figure standing in the thermal camera and says ""we gotta get out of here now!"" I mean what paranormal team has ever left an investigation like that especially when there is oh so much activity going on? Trust me everyone don't waste your time!",1476144000,,1109,4.091743119266055
8593951,1,B00DJYK4TQ,"This was just...bad. I think they actually wanted to turn this into a tv show later of sorts. I watched this for free on another service plan. It has not plot besides wandering around an office...i think building in full daylight, while being pelted with pens, not kidding, pens. We never really got information about the building because the ""historian"" would have to research it later... uhm, isn't the point to research it beforehand? wait, she did know one fact about the previous tenant of the building ""he had a condition that made his feet smell"".... GREAT!

They had this weird soundtrack that overshadowed every single thing, they would add dramatic music, and i mean EVERYTHING.Then they would be like ""see we are going to show you this so you know it's not fake"" , and would show all the table legs, and then not show the legs and people at the same time to ""prove"" it was real. Which i mean, i didn't believe it was, i just didn't expect the kids to be doing the special effects. Seriously, remember making ""spooky"" movies as kids? and you would do all these tricks to fool the audience, but one person would always mess up and spoil the trick a bit? ...yeah.

I guess if you like slow torturing yourself, watch this. oh and the cover has nothing to do with this movie, but it's a cool cover.",1462233600,,1304,4.4978902953586495
8593952,1,B00DJYK4TQ,"Whenever you see anything by with Lee Roberts and the ""Ghost Adventure UK Team"" crew, you can rest assured you are in for a silly, stereotypical, formulaic ""ghost hunting"" mockumentary. Im not a fan of the term mockumentary, as that implies humor (like Spinal Tap), but the phrase has, over recent years, come to include any horror video or film that is fictional or staged, like all of Lee Roberts' many videos. But, if you enjoy the phony ghost hunting videos, and that's entertaining for you, then you might rent it - everyone has their own preferences, of course.

In this video, you'll have to restrain yourself from the insulting nature of the off-camera hijinks, like the use of multiple camera angles - edited to appear to have taken place at the same time - to have someone under the table or on the other side (off camera) lift up the table, then quickly cut to another camera (with footage shot just prior to or just after the staged trick) to make it appear as if everything's happening at the same time. The tossing of a pen onto a table by a crew member off camera, then slowed down with dramatic music and Roberts' cheesy comments, to ascribe the event to a ghost having dropped it from the ceiling. This video is FULL of those kinds of cheap tricks. Lee is the digital equivalent of a corner magic shop with all the silly slights of hand that used to have us believing in magic when we were 5 years old..

On top of all of it, you have to endure an overbearing musical soundtrack that the sound editor and director somehow felt would add suspense. It's actually at the same level as the dialogue, which makes it an even lamer experience. I think they attempted to overpower the sillyl tricks and lazy ""ghost"" effects, and the overall ""let's throw everything at the viewer"" approach to try and establish a spooky mood. hashtag fail.",1452988800,2,1847,4.543543543543543
8593953,1,B00DJYK4TQ,"This 69 minute film comes across as a TV series or pilot. This movie is apparently one very lame episode. The description on the DVD cover tells you what they find, although the write up is an extreme amount of hype with nothing scary about the film. A chair moves across the floor, about 6 inches. Thermal hand prints on the wall...ooooh scary. A marker and pencil drops from the ceiling...serious scary. And as the DVD states, a thermal image of an apparition...too much, I am about ready to pass out.

Horribly lame film footage.

No swearing, or nudity.",1409011200,5,557,4.616161616161616
