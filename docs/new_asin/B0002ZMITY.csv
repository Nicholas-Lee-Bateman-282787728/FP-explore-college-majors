2152779,4,B0002ZMITY,"Alot of people were sort of let down with this film. I almost didn't watch this film due to some bad reviews I had read. If there's one thing I've learned over the years it's that most film reviewers don't know what they're talking about. If movie reviewers know so much why don't they make their own films? Be your own judge when it comes to movies. I've seen alot of great films get thrown in the crapper because of bad reviews.
Not watching this film would have been a big mistake on my part. Ali G Indahouse was full of laughs from the opening scene. Sure it's not the most intelligent film but it sure as hell ranks up there with the best comedy flicks of the past 10 years. I don't think I've seen a film that made me laugh this hard in a long time. I'm sure the people who hated this film loved the lame American Pie trilogy or the completley unfunny and unorigional Old School.
Even the deleted scenes in this film are hilarious. There's one deleted scene that made me cry laughing. It was a parody of west side story involving a booger fight.
Take it from me (a comedy writer), Ali G Indahouse is a funny movie worth watching. If you don't get at least one or two good laughs out of this film e-mail me and tell me what a moron I am.",1099612800,14,1242,4.157676348547718

2152782,2,B0002ZMITY,"Ali G is one of the great characters created by Sacha Baron Cohen that is the star of HBO's series, Da Ali G Show.  The series on HBO is spectacular, as Cohen feeds on the Andy Kaufman style of comedy, walking the line between comedy and downright irritation.  Discussing intellectual subjects with experts, Cohen plays Ali G as an ignorant and poorly spoken talk show host, always putting his guests in awkward spots of conversation.  It's brilliant and hilarious to watch, I have not missed an episode yet.

That said, this movie is a travesty, and should be skipped by anyone who truly appreciates Cohen's gift.  His style of comedy is best presented in a live situation with off-the-cuff comments and queries.  In this movie, the humor is almost too forced, it lacks spontenaity and more often than not falls into cliched humor and tired jokes.  The plot is not only weak but super predictable.  I do give this two stars instead of one, as there are 3 or 4 jokes that actually did make me laugh.  However, as a whole, this movie was a serious waste of time and an insult to the true genius of Cohen.",1099008000,54,1103,4.53030303030303
2152783,5,B0002ZMITY,"Great movie and finally available here.  This movie came out years ago in the UK.  Why does it take so long for some movies to come here?  If you like Ali G at all watch this movie, it's a feature length hollywood style film, very well done, and looks like it had a good budget.  Now they just need to release all of his best of Ali G shows from Britain.  GET THIS MOVIE!",1098662400,5,371,3.9594594594594597
2152784,2,B0002ZMITY,"Ali G is, in my opinion, one of the best icons of British comedy to come out in the past 10 years. Taking the Mickey out of wannabe ghetto kids, white guys who pretend to be black and ignorant meatheaded idiots all at once whilst winding people up who think his politically incorrect and often stupid comments are serious, he has often reduced me to a fit of laughter on the living room floor. However, this full length film severely misses the mark.

First off, the humour lacks any subtlty. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't really a gangster. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't well-endowed and that he didn't really get loads of girls. We didn't need to know that he lived with his mum. We knew he was stupid. Having it all spelt out ruins the image.

Secondly, due to the lack of real life situations, there is no opportunity for Sacha Baron Cohen to utilise his quick wit and annoy people. Every joke is pre-planned for the film and rather than being an extension of the hilarious TV show, the film simply takes his character and puts it into a ridiculously unrealistic situation that, although may raise a smile, certainly won't make you laugh out loud.

If this is all you've seen of Ali G then do yourself a favour and find some episodes of The 11 O'Clock Show or Da Ali G Show (the latter can be found on his Ali G Aiiiiii video). This film could be worth a watch if you like Ali G, but be warned: the quick wit and comedy genius is replaced with purile humour not much better than The Bloodhound Gang. And that's saying something.",1096243200,22,1558,4.347079037800687

2152869,2,B0002ZMITY,"The Bottom Line:

The reason Sasha Baron Cohen is funny is because of the fact that he's springing his outrageous personas on real people, so I have no idea why the creators of Ali G Indahouse thought they should change the nature of Cohen's comedy by putting his Ali G character through a series of very scripted and largely unfunny motions that take him away from his strong suit; the problem would be rectified in Borat and Bruno, but this film (which tellingly wasn't given a theatrical release in the U.S.) falls flat on its face.

2/4",1254528000,,540,4.556701030927835
2152870,1,B0002ZMITY,"Though I am a fan, I unfortunately have no choice but to give this movie 1/5 stars (because I couldn't give it 0/5).

If you know about Sacha Baron Cohen from his recent films (Bruno, Borat, Talladega Nights), you'll probably be interested in Ali G, his first over the top persona.

This movie was released as a spin-off of the tv show in 2002 and it is in a completely different comic vein than the rest of his work.  Though he did write and produce the flick, somehow it turned out to be completely incongruous with his otherwise exceptional and unique blend of wit, graceless incompetence, and subtle, good-spirited mockery.

Baron Cohen's brilliance lies in his ability to manipulate real situations; to build an incredibly awkward framework, a uniquely clumsy and ludicrous sphere of consciousness almost, within which like a mad puppeteer, or a perverted symphonic conductor of the absurd, he directs and orchestrates scenes on the fly from directly within them.  There's an anxious and sometimes frantic quality about the situational structure of the film, thanks in large part to the direction of Larry Charles.  The approach he took with Borat, Religilous with Bill Maher, and again with Bruno (which I haven't seen yet, can't wait for the DVDRips to come out-- DVD will be released September 30!), the viewer experiences a strange sensation` that resembels being shocked, but is more along the lines of not being able to believe what you're [...] seeing.

In Borat, not only the performance of Baron Cohen but the whole tone of what writing there was (being that the film is largely improvisational in nature) and the production was extremely cohesive, and displayed sense of being ""in character"" so ingrained and so intrinsic that real people in real situations end up involuntarily in one sense and voluntarily in another, playing ""the straight man"".  As they play along and indulge the antics of these over the top, and often baffling characters, steadily the evelope is pushed a little further and a little further until you come to find yourself not so much shocked, but awed at it's sheer audacity.  The best moments of these films, many as there are, usually come when the ""participants"" as I suppose they may be called are goaded or, to be more accurate, baited into either making their bed or digging their grave.  And in the end quite a lot of the most memorable lines in the films are not scripted-- the stuff they couldn't make up.

Where these other films were revolutionary in that respect, Ali G Indahouse is anything but.  This cheesy, low brow, nigh unwatchable drivel from the very first scene descends to a level akin to the likes of Tom Green, How High, Amerikaz Most Wanted, and almost anything Martin Lawrence has ever done.  It's depressing almost when you consider how clever the other stuff is.  And granted, the ""blue"" humor (ie, dick jokes. lots of dick jokes.) does show up in the other material, but it is certainly approached in a fashion that is far removed from the hyperactive 3rd grader mentality which this straight-to-DVD grade crap exhibits.

So there it is.

On the other hand, I do highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Da-Ali-G-Show/dp/B000JBXH82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Da Ali G Show</a>, the television series where the characters of Borat and Bruno started, which ran over a span of four years between Channel 4 in the UK and HBO in the US.

I could tell you, but you really ought to just see for yourself how hilarious it is.

In conclusion,

BOOYAKASHAW! Keep it Real! Don't get mashed up! Big up yaself! Respek.",1251244800,,3624,4.980099502487562
2152871,4,B0002ZMITY,"""Ali G In Da House"" is a very funny movie that has some very silly comedy in it. I was able to watch the movie in Britain when it was in the theaters there and at the time I thought it was not done very well, and that it was some sort of poorly done gangsta rap take off (A-la: Don't Be a Menace to South Central while Sipping your Juice in the Hood). However, as with Monty Python and Benny Hill it is just typical British humor.

It may be a little difficult for some viewers on our side of the ""pond"" to understand what the characters are speaking about as they use lots of British slang, and phrases that we never hear or use here. But I definitely recommend it to anyone who may be aware of hip hop culture from the late '90's and even early '80's. It will crack you up, as it is an accurate depiction of what the ""jungle"" or ""garage"" (pronounced the English way - these are the names associated with hip-hop in Britain) culture is like in Britain, and just how different it is from our hip hop culture here. Tip for those who might have a hard time understanding British English: Put on the subtitles to really understand what they are saying. Enjoy, and remember to laugh.

2152924,5,B0002ZMITY,"An excellent comedy, Ali G Indahouse, brings to the screen the story of a down-on-his-luck young man who is introduced into the world of politics in the form of an elected Member of Parliament in order to be used as bait to bring down the British Prime Minister. What complicates things is that he does a pretty good job...

Sacha Baron Cohen and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

In short, Ali G Indahouse is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!",1156636800,7,935,4.753086419753086

You are now in the distinguished company of your SNL cousins from across the pond who turned funny 5 minute skits into full length movie suckfests.  Yes, Da Ali G show is hilarious, due mostly to its main character, Ali G.  His interviews with famous politicians and roundtable discussions with experts are never a disappointment.  You would therefore think that an Ali G who is funny in extemporaneous situations such as an interview would be even funnier in a movie which he scripted.  And you would be incorrect, sir!  The movie is a 90 minute mess.  The ""plot"" is mentioned elsewhere on this page, so no need for me to ridicule it.  But suffice it to say that the Ali G character here is a grating bore, lacking in wit or charisma.  If you like Ali G, you will not like this.",1148428800,9,854,4.458064516129032
2152927,5,B0002ZMITY,"This has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

It is full of laughs, and sometimes it is dry humour - you have to think to see what's funny - like the time Ali G and enemies were having a gunfight, and Ali G stopped the fight to escort two children across the road. When he set them down he said 'Remember kids, life is the most precious gift of all' and then as soon as they were on their way, he started shooting again!

Oh well, I won't tell you anymore, otherwise I'll spoil the story. But you should seriously see it.

If you don't like it, well start wishing that you could shoot people like me over the internet.

2152928,4,B0002ZMITY,"I love the show as it is funny to see Sacha ask silly questions while looking serious and the people being interviewed being completely lost or thinking he is out of his mind.

Those expressions on the show are really what makes it so funny...if anyone seen the short Andy Rooney clip then you would know what I mean.

Many people on these reviews have noted that they love the show but they hate the movie. Too many people wanted the same thing in the movie as in the show ala the MTV Jackass show and the movie being the same.

However I think they took a risk and just made a movie from the view of Ali G not Sacha...I think the gamble paid off.

Sure the humor is low brow and all but if you went into the movie thinking it would be otherwise, maybe you were not being too smart.

I thought the movie was very funny and kept me laughing many times and I have watched it numerous times.

The ONLY thing that irked me was they only gave Sacha's Borat character a 2-3 second cameo and he is what I find the funniest on the show.

I think it would have been very funny to see the borat character and ali g character interact some more with Borat trying to hug or do something to ali g.

But all in all this is a very funny movie...unless you are a prude or think you are going to get a longer version of the show.",1135296000,6,1313,4.042471042471043

Take it for the fluff entertainment it is and if you like this sort of thing (I normally don't), then enjoy it. If not, pass it by and get something else.",1135036800,4,392,3.8875

2152931,5,B0002ZMITY,"First of all, a brief disclaimer... if you're a fan of the series... you'll probably be disappointed.  Gags and storyline take the place of Ali G's unique trademark... interviewing the top talking heads of our generation and getting them to say the most ridiculous things imaginable (My first dose of him was he was interviewing an expert on terrorism and managed to get him to complate how the government could prepare for terrorists crashing a train into the White House...) His victims think they're interviewing a new type of young journalist in touch with the young generation...  the ongoing question being is are they playing along, or really victims of the joke.  That said...

As stupid as the concept would seem, this movie is hillarious to the point of brilliance... and by hillarious I mean that even after multiple watchings its still funny.  Beyond the low ANIMAL HOUSE/Howard Stern type humor (which IS funny in itself ) the film is conceptually held together by simply presenting Peter Seller's BEING THERE charactor as a wannabe b-boy - - In doing so, the film is able to have MTV Jackass type humor with a coherent story to boot... the film never ceases to be hllarious.  Contrary to the misconception of some that Ali G is parodying hip hop culture, the film sets asides all doubts of who is charactor really is....  a white boy who lives with his mum, and who's entire world is an MTV music video fantasy.  Cohen's parody sheds ridiculous light on the phenomena of (often) spoiled and bratty suburban white kids pretending to be black and from the hood...  If you've ever wittnessed the strange phenomena of 14 year old suburban mallrats who are just about as gangsta as teflon and Lawrence Welk and unlike a real ""gangsta"" could easily be tamed with a good dose of ridlin and a nice slap across the face (causing their oversized boxer shorts to fall down) this film will crack you up.  - -  The only worse than this are the over-aged30/lives with mum breakdancing old school hip hop fan/wannabe's of which Ali G's is also ""representin'"" - - I wouldn't call the film better than Austin Powers or Wayne`s World, but the parody and satire are way up there...  This is definitely a surprize winner !",1118707200,28,2216,4.712435233160622

2152945,3,B0002ZMITY,"sure, Ali G Indahouse is kinda absurd & nowhere in the same league as his vastly superior show on HBO, but that still didn't stop me from busting a gut here & there. For all I know, maybe the absurdity is deliberate...y'know, maybe the movie was supposed to have been written from the mind of ""Ali G"" instead of Sacha Baron Cohen, kinda like a bigger-budget ""Spys"" (a cheesy movie Ali G pitched on one of his HBO episodes). Fans of BBC's ""The Office"" will barely recognize Martin Freeman as one of Ali G's poseur homeys...between Tim Canterbury and this role, let's just say Freeman's pretty much covered both sides of the spectrum and then some. And Rhona Mitra (the original Lara Croft, for those unaware) is most definitely easy on the eyes, and to my suprise she brought some game with her acting chops. Ali G Indahouse is worthy of at least a rental IMO, after that you can draw your own conclusion whether to buy it or not.",1109116800,2,929,4.470588235294118
2152946,4,B0002ZMITY,"A wonderful film! This could so easily have been a half hour television programme over-extended to fill a film's running time, but by teaming up with the ever professional writers directors and producers at Working Title, Sacha Baron Cohen has produced a film that really feels like a film. The plot works well, and although there is a small problem over whether Ali G is really cool, or really a bit of a wally (the writing is inconsistent here), he is never an unsympathetic character, even when being selfish or misogynistic. Some of the humour is crude, ppeurile, or even embarrassing, but this is in keeping with the whole Ali G thing, and if you're a fan I doubt you would be offended. The scenes set in the gang land of L.A. are excellent, and wouldn't look out of place in a Steven Segal movie, and believe it or not, these fit in well with the urban decline of Staines and its environs.

There is some good support playing by Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, who look a little out of place, but are nevertheless convincing. It was a good idea for Gambon's Prime Minister to be a good guy, so different from the cynicism we normally expect from political comedy. There is a dreadful guest performance from fashion model Naomi Campbell, who looks great but can't act, so it's no surprise that the majority of this ends up in the 'deleted scenes' extra.

The soundtrack is superb, clearly having been put together by someone with a good knowledge of Rap and Hip Hop classics of the last twenty years, and this complements the action enormously by lending it some much needed credibility. The extras are good, especially as Ali himself presents the excised scenes with the introduction that they were cut because they were no good! This film is much better than I thought it would be, and my recommendation is that if you like Ali G you will love this film.",1108080000,2,1863,4.591591591591592

There are some genuinely funny moments - but it's obvious that the (at least seemingly) spontaneous quality of the series can't really be replicated for ""da film.""
