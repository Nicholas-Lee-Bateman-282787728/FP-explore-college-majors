7028126,2,B00U2YNMQI,"I started watching and my initial impression  was this was going to be a bad movie.  In the first 30 min, I was too aware the actors  were ACTING and trying to setup the rest of the movie. After a couple funny yet cheezy lines, the actors, seem to be take themselves less seriously By the end,  I was not totally  hating  the movie.  Still I personally  did not like the movie.",1452902400,2,377,4.138888888888889
7028127,1,B00U2YNMQI,And there was nothing in this movie worth mentioning. It might be a good watch when you've watched everything else.,1452470400,2,115,4.8

7028131,5,B00U2YNMQI,"The look, the writing and the performances of this flick are far above any expectations that one might have for a mini-micro-low budget action, adventure, horror, comedy.  It's a fun time and worth a watch, or two.  You won't regret the time you spend viewing.",1451433600,2,260,4.7555555555555555

7028134,4,B00U2YNMQI,Very fun indie movie that has a nostalgic throwback feel to the movies I used to watch coming up. I liked the cartoony vibe it gave off and the lead actress was cute!,1431993600,2,166,4.0606060606060606

The acting was bad like bad school play awful.",1456876800,,122,4.857142857142857
7028139,4,B00U2YNMQI,"So INCREDIBLY Silly
Laugh Out Loud funny
 You could tell that they were having fun in the making of the film; and weren't taking themselves too seriously as they did so.
(my guess at others' complaints of sound quality was due to a sort of echo effect given to certain types of characters voices)
Reminds me of when our crowd used to gather round and watch ""Bad Chinese Theater"".

 *Highly Recommended Fun*",1456012800,2,406,4.611111111111111
7028140,3,B00U2YNMQI,"This is a low budget movie with all of the expected problems with low budget films, but on the most part they did a very good job at telling a comedic fantasy adventure.

It's a really good story idea with lots of potential.  A pirate is sent 300 years in to his future to reclaim his treasure in modern day.  His treasure is unfortunately a demon summoning, world threatening amulet.  Sweet.  It also turns out that this pirate's treasure has more than one interesting relic.  Hollywood, get your hands on this script!

It went well until there was a detour to a cheesy house party.  Fine, but that part should have been prefaced with a good reason for going.  They already had the amulet.  Another bad decision was to have some of the actors wear wigs, when it would have brought more realism to the movie if they didn't wear them.

Otherwise, the movie is cute and the editing, sound, lighting and acting gets way better by the end.  .It feels like a small town production, which is inspiring to see.  We need more films like these.  And most of all we need to support them.",1454803200,3,1077,4.428571428571429
7028141,5,B00U2YNMQI,Great movie very tongue and cheek. The budget was low but quality was high.,1453939200,2,75,4.428571428571429
7028142,1,B00U2YNMQI,I really like a good B movie or independent film. This was nothing like a good B movie.  Couldn't even watch past the first 15 minutes and I've watched some really bad movies all the way through hoping they would get better. Horrible acting.  Really terrible.,1453507200,2,259,4.608695652173913
7028143,1,B00U2YNMQI,This movie really sucked. Will not tell people to see this.,1453507200,2,59,4.454545454545454

8704143,1,B00U2YNMQI,"I can't really critique this film because I gave up watching after 4 minutes.  I expected a crazy bloodthirsty turkey to show up to kill everybody, but was disappointed.  I guess the movie was the turkey.",1466553600,,204,4.638888888888889

8704146,3,B00U2YNMQI,"Very Amusing.  Kudos for doing something creative and fun with little resources and time.  This is where good efforts come from, which may pay off later for the writers, film makers, actors and supporting staff.  You can either see things half full or half empty--I prefer half full and growing.  Keep it up!  Oh--this is also instructive if you want to understand how film-making and ambition germinate, stew start and progress to something more.  You can also identify what needs to be improved, but still enjoy it for what it is.  Kudos!",1462492800,,540,4.804347826086956
8704147,3,B00U2YNMQI,"Done tongue in cheek.  If you want good acting it is not here but the dumb stuff keeps you laughing.  I got to say, for a bad movie it was good enough to waste an evening.",1462233600,,171,3.7222222222222223
