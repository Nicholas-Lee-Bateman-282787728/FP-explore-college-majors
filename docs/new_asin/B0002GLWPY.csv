2098372,1,B0002GLWPY,This copy of a vintage movie was so blurry you could not make out the faces of the actors. the sound track was buffled at best mostly unable to make out what they were saying...I've made better tapes! Total waste of money & I bet this was a bootleg tape !,1122940800,,255,4.019607843137255
2098373,3,B0002GLWPY,In one early scene Edgar Buchannan's character is having a bachelor party with his also old buck friends. THe bachelor party is them all sitting in rocking chairs going back and forth! Fortunately once Buchannan meets up with his old pal Brennan things get better from there. Natalie Wood's sister Lana has a small but meaty role in this western dramedy too.,1098662400,,358,4.790322580645161

2098386,3,B0002GLWPY,"It is OK. Not too bad for it's genre, but don't expect action and thrills as in modern flicks.",1437436800,,94,4.0

2098389,4,B0002GLWPY,This was fun watching.  We hadn't seen some of these actors in some time.  Fred Astaire played a very believable drunk.  We enjoyed it.,1435449600,,135,4.541666666666667

2098393,5,B0002GLWPY,good old movie,1430352000,,14,4.0
2098394,3,B0002GLWPY,It's not the greatest script but if you're a fan of old westerns like I am the cast is worth watching. I was impressed with the way that Fred Astaire slipped into the genre like he had made westerns all his life.,1430352000,,212,4.071428571428571
2098395,3,B0002GLWPY,Entertaining movie with the entire Over the Hill Gang plus Fred Astaire.,1430352000,,72,5.083333333333333
2098396,4,B0002GLWPY,Not too bad for the old fardts riding again. The picture was worth watching.,1429488000,,76,4.5
2098397,3,B0002GLWPY,"I love these guys in a movie together. But, I must admit, the acting is not that wonderful. However, it is worth it to me just to see them all together.",1428278400,,152,3.935483870967742

2098400,5,B0002GLWPY,Love movies that have clean language and shows that even though you slow down with age.  Experience in life play a big part in how you cope.  Love these wonderful actors who have passed away.  Simple good for you movie. If you like the old time stars you will enjoy this movie.,1415836800,,277,4.288461538461538

2098404,5,B0002GLWPY,Very fun movie!  Great cast.,1404432000,,28,4.6
2098405,2,B0002GLWPY,"It was fun to see these old characters together--Fred Astaire along with Walter Brennan, Andy Devine, Edgar Buchanan, Chill Wills and others.  If you're not old enough to remember those guys, you probably won't enjoy the movie. My low rating is because the video quality was the worst I have ever seen, and the audio had problems, too.  My suggestion: try it on Prime if you like; but if you have to pay for it, watch something else.",1402790400,,433,4.538461538461538
2098406,4,B0002GLWPY,"it's a good, old--fashioned movie. lots of good clean fun. has many of the old western stars in great roles.",1385510400,,108,4.45
2098407,4,B0002GLWPY,Light comedy from a bygone era of movies.  Good family story with an old-time western plot and wholesome family entertainment.,1380067200,,126,5.3
2098408,3,B0002GLWPY,"A predictable made-for-TV movie from 1970 featuring a quartet of western veterans and...Fred Astaire! While Astaire looks more like a riverboat gambler than a feared ex-Texas Ranger, it was fun watching him in an unexpected role. The picture quality is not perfect, as if the master has been allowed to degenerate over the years. And the ""extra"" biography of Astaire contains a big error, saying he appeared in two movies called ""Irene Castle"" and ""The Story of Vernon."" He was actually in one film titled ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle""! Oops. For Astaire fans, it's worth watching.",1374451200,3,590,4.96969696969697
2098409,3,B0002GLWPY,It was entertaining.  I enjoyed watching because it was light material and made for easy watching.  Acting was good by all.,1370649600,,123,4.809523809523809
2098410,4,B0002GLWPY,Just to see this cast of classic western film players together again is well worth the time.  I loved the first one and like this one.,1368230400,,134,4.153846153846154
2098411,5,B0002GLWPY,No problems with any of the process with this dvd or company selling it.  I will try this again real soon.  HSP,1340236800,,111,4.0
2098412,5,B0002GLWPY,I got this movie for my parents who saw it on tv years ago. I loved it. It was in great condition and came in a timely fashion.,1208822400,2,127,3.5714285714285716
2098413,4,B0002GLWPY,A made-for-TV-movie and an old one at that!  This is most likely the last movie some of these actors made.  But to see them again still playing the same sort of characters they played all through the 50's...well...what a ride!,1202601600,3,226,4.625
8027924,5,B0002GLWPY,"Very entertaining; still amusing with much less silliness. Better story, good acting.

Have to say, however, that nothing suggests that the final scenes are fantasy. If not, something missing.",1505088000,,192,5.620689655172414
8027925,4,B0002GLWPY,Good,1486166400,,4,4.0
8027926,1,B0002GLWPY,"This movie shows why Astaire was a dancer, NOT an actor.",1484956800,,56,4.181818181818182
8027927,2,B0002GLWPY,Too silly for me.,1480896000,,17,3.5

8027930,3,B0002GLWPY,I liked the first one better. It was interesting seeing Fred Astaire play in a cowboy movie.,1475452800,,92,4.470588235294118
8027931,5,B0002GLWPY,It was about the same as the other over the hill gang movies,1470787200,,60,3.6923076923076925
8027932,4,B0002GLWPY,"Love this!  Must have been one of Fred's (Astaire) final roles and he's great. . Easy going story of broken down, retired Texas rangers supporting one another for one last time. Not much violence so please Check your Guns at the door to your tv room!  Ha!",1470009600,,255,4.404255319148936
