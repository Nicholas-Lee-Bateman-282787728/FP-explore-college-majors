They are Educational and very colorful, the animation is just adorable, the characters are so cute and at times funny that I even get a chuckle watching them. Overall it kept my granddaughter interested and she was learning to spell the words along with the characters. We now have a collection.",1430524800,,510,4.554347826086956
