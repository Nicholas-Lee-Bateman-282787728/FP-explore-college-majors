7962721,4,B000067D0G,There was really very little new information here with the exception of the details for the Queen Mum's final passing.  I thought it interesting that only the Queen the Viscount Lindley and Lady Sarah were with her when she died and none of the queen's own grandchildren were present.  All in all a very readable and enjoyable biography of this great lady.,1422144000,,356,4.725806451612903
7962722,4,B000067D0G,"This is a DVD made from earlier films, when the Queen Mother turned 80 and then 90.  So, no, it doesn't document her entire life until its end. This apparently was done on film for TV, so it's not as sharp, possibly, as something made originally for DVD.  However, that's no real problem, one becomes accustomed in the first couple of minutes.  And, of course, so much of the film and photography is from the distant past anyway.  I particularly enjoyed the film footage of Queen Elizabeth from during the war and afterward.  This is no comprehensive biography, but is an enjoyable visit with one of the dominant personalities of the last century.",1207526400,7,647,4.6902654867256635
7962723,5,B000067D0G,I have always found it remarkable and amazing that the Queen Mother was still carrying out engagements well into her 80's.  She was truly a unique woman.,1194220800,2,153,4.666666666666667
