5685488,1,B00C1LIZGM,"Is Cuba Gooding Jr. this hard up for roles?  Obviously the producers knew they had a dog and felt the only way to gain at the box office (if it ever was at the box office) was to put a known name in the cast. Otherwise, this really should have been a made for TV movie.

Single artist, who doesn't own a computer so she has to use the library's, living on a gorgeous estate in Marin County.  Right.  Cop living in a large home in S.F.  Right.  Cheesy music.  Poor effects.  Cop shots the killer in the back when he's leaning over a swimming pool, not threatening him.

If you enjoy Lifetime or other made for TV movies, you might like this.  If cinematic quality is your preference, run away!",1373932800,,692,4.213740458015267
5685489,5,B00C1LIZGM,"""Summoned"" is by far the best new movie I have seen this year!  I rarely give a movie 5 stars but this one earned every one of them.  I have to tip my hat to Peter Sullivan who both wrote and directed this riveting thriller.  The plot revolves around a series of seemingly accidental and suicide caused deaths to the jurors who handed down a guilty verdict in a lurid murder case dubbed ""The Midnight Murder' case which begin occurring five years after the execution of a convicted murderer.  The deaths are happenning to the former jurors in the order of their numbers on the jury panel beginning with the jury foreman who subsequently wrote a book about the trial which was critical of the police investigation.  In each of the mysterious deaths the victims received messages which read ""So many evils"".  Many of the vitims also saw apparitions of the sentenced man and felt his presence around them.  Ashley Scott does a wonderful job as Juror number 5 whose time might be nearly up.  She teams up with a police detective who was close friends with the first victim and together they reopen the original investigation.  Peter Sullivan did a marvelous job of intertwining the ghost story{with plenty of ""jolt shocks""] with the investigation.  ""Summoned"" is non-stop action and scares from the beginning to the end of the 90 minute movie.  A terrific addition to anyone's DVD collection and one you will watch again many times.",1372291200,6,1428,4.7408906882591095
5685490,2,B00C1LIZGM,"In the opening scene, Nathan (Scott Whyte) finds himself thrust into the middle of a Steven King novel. He was the jury foreman of a trial that convicted Evan Lucas (Dylan Vox) of murder. Now it appears Lucas is back as the jurors die one by one with a supernatural element involved. Laura Price (Ashley Scott) is juror number 5 and has started to track the deaths once weird things start to happen to her.

Laura gets the eager help of detective Michael Lyons (Bailey Chase) and a minor role for Cuba Gooding Jr. no matter how big they slap his face on the cover. After an hour of low grade horror the film shift gears to a low grade detective case. The film felt like Steven King wrote a film for the Lifetime network and then died before he could finish leaving it up to network writers to complete. It was a horror film that has been done before and better.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Implied sex. Ashley Scott in undergarments.",1371340800,5,950,4.422857142857143
5685491,3,B00C1LIZGM,"""Saw him again this afternoon. Seems to be stalking me wherever I go."" Five years ago serial killer Simon Bourdias was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Now mysterious deaths are occurring to the members of the jury. Juror number 5 Laura Price (Scott) starts to investigate and begins to wonder if the deaths are a coincidence or something more mysterious then she ever imagined. I have to say that after the last Cuba Gooding movie I watched I was very worried that this one would be bad too. Not to spoil anything but he is in this for about 10 minutes. That said this movie was not that terrible. While it does have the feel of a made-for-TV movie it is watchable and I have seen much worse. The movie is a little slow at times and a little repetitive but it does keep you watching and interested all the way till the end. Overall, one of the better B-rate movies that I have seen in awhile. Nothing amazing but this is worth watching. I surprisingly give it a B.",1371081600,2,979,4.355191256830601
5685492,4,B00C1LIZGM,"Careful, Spoilers could be read.

The production was good, loved the photography in some scenes. If some one had took the risk to give more budget on the movie, the product would be much better. The plot is interesting and keeps your attention on the movie. The Director could keep us much more on the edge with a bit more of work, for example, he could develop more the chemistry between Michael and the artist and create an interesting back and forth, and create a bigger tension on the plot. My dissapoint was the end, it could be stronger and most exciting. The Director had all the elements to do a very powerful film and let it go. Maybe he focused on Directa Tv film, when he could be focused on Direct a great film.

Ashley Scott handled the role of Laura Price very well, she has a strong performance, Ashley let us see Laura through her and let us understand her world. Laura is a intelligent woman looking for answers, with determination, not needing to be rude. he is not a weak woman sitting waiting for help, she looks for answers, she push the detective to investigate more in a crime. Her part with Cuba Gooding Jr. was great. In a near future with a great script on hands, Ashley will give us an excellent performance and surprise us.

Bailey Chase plays Michael, the detective that stops to listen Laura and finds out what she is not a crazy woman with strange ideas. Bailey protrays a man focused on his work, not showing social life and with his mind busy trying to solve his cases. He is young and maybe for that reason a ""normal"" suicide is not for him ""normal"", he looks beyond that. Sometimes he is not very expressive and not shows emotions, for that reason surprised me that he developed a love interest by Laura. The interacton between his character & Laura is great, the actors had a good chemistry between them on the screen.

Cuba Goodind Jr. could give a bit more. He is a great actor but he is missing (maybe) the love in your job. He could make his character shine but...

Summoned it's a good movie, not an excellent movie, but keeps your attention. The plot is good, could be much better but still you will enjoy it. the best of the film are the performances. Watch it and enjoy a good moment.",1370822400,5,2228,4.411192214111922

5685516,5,B00C1LIZGM,"When she learns of the suicide of the bestselling author of a true crime novel based on a sensational murder trial, of which he was jury foreman, another former juror who'd kept in touch becomes suspicious. She learns other jurors have died in so-called accidents or suicides, in the order they were selected for the jury, and she is Number 5 on the list. Involving a policeman and his partner who investigated the original case, they find proof that evidence was tampered with and witnesses were coerced to lie and an innocent man was convicted of the crime. Now it appears his ghost is back for revenge against those who condemned him...or is he? What appears an obvious story of retribution from beyond the grave deftly switches gears in mid-story to become something else.

Good acting, a good script, and an intriguing story in the way it starts out looking like one thing and slowly changing into another.  Going back and seeing the movie again after learning the true story, the first scenes can be viewed in a different way, becoming not a story of revenge but of forgiveness.  Only one complaint I had was the insertion of the heroine's pregnancy and loss of her baby which seemed to have nothing to do at all with the plot in any form and appeared to have merely been written in for a bit of pathos. I kept expecting there to be some big revelation about that but there never was, except a mention now and then, though no explanations of a marriage, divorce, husband or father, only a small tearjerker. Still, it was too minor to stop the action so perhaps it can be ignored.

There isn't that much blood and gore but it's tense and scary nevertheless.",1435881600,,1662,4.585858585858586

5685521,5,B00C1LIZGM,"I usually avoid movies dealing with the devil, the supernatural, etc., as they scare me very much.  But I am so glad I decided to take the chance to watch this.  I won't give the story line away but will just say that what I thought was going to be some type of devil movie, it was not.

The acting was quite good, the plot twisting and turning throughout, Laura's house (is that the main character's name?) was just breathtaking and I loved looking at it, how it was decorated as well as the architecture.  While I will not watch movies that seem to deal with evil or devils, etc. (never got over 'The Omen' when I was little!), this was anything but a devil movie.  I am so glad it turned out the way it did because it didn't make a lot of sense to me as it went on.  Enough said.  I don't want to give away any of the plot.

Watch it for yourself...I liked everything about it!

PS  Does anyone know where this was filmed...in particular the setting/location of her house?  Just beautiful!",1379980800,2,992,4.251336898395722

8576247,1,B00C1LIZGM,"Very poor acting, extremely predictable and scripts I could mouth as the actors and actresses said their lines. Transitions from one scene to another were not established for example, when actor enters a room during an intense scene, the phase out goes to the following day with no issue explained.  In another scene, the lead actress is confronted by a young boy who states ""You're next"" then the following scene cuts to her heading out to her car as if nothing happened. Fright scenes were not scary as they should be. I was not entertained by this film.",1487462400,,556,4.673469387755102
