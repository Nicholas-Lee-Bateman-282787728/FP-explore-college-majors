8492609,1,B001TI6272,Don't know why they want me to review this.  The CD in the case (used product) was not the CD that went with the ordered product.  I returned the product and received a refund.  I have purchased from this company before ( new items only) and had no issues.  The CD that I received was for a very old version of FTM and it was not the product that I ordered nor was it readable by any computer produced since 2000.,1393200000,2,413,4.061728395061729
