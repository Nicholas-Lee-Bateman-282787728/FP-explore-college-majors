This documentary covers a different tribe that buried their dead high in Andean cliffs.  The researchers are trying to find a tomb that hasn't been looted.

The tribe covered had similar walls like those in Machu Picchu.  However, I find most docs on Machu to be boring as they only focus on stone edifices.  This work showed cloth and pottery and mummies, etc.  Like the Maya, the tribe may have been bloody, as pictures of humans holding severed heads are shown.  This work suggests that unlike the Aztecs and Inca, this tribe may not have had gold, or much of it.  Still, they got dissed by the Spanish even though they had originally joined with them to fight the Inca.

This work is similar to docs on Ancient Egypt.  The mummies were wrapped and some were placed in sarcophagi.  There was fear about bad luck if you robbed a grave, yet plenty of graves were robbed.  Few tombs in Egypt have remained unlooted either.  However, it is emphasized that reaching these tombs is difficult and I haven't heard that emphasized regarding pyramids.  The doc never says ""Carnavale!,"" but it's stated that one week during Easter ceremonies, it is deemed okay to loot these sites.

The work showed modern indigenous Peruvians in black-and-white to give the sense of the antiquity of these sites.  However, 1940s-ish black-and-white footage is much more recent than these graves from 1,000 years ago.  Most documentaries in distant locations show a mix of Western scholars and native ones.  For example, Dr. Zahi Hawass, with his awesome chin dimple and dramatic speaking style, is almost always interviewed in Egyptian works.  Here, there were indigenous laborers, but all the scholars were white.  I'm almost sure Peru had many of its own experts that could have been reached.  Further, a great deal of this work involves lying to the Peruvian laborers in order to keep finds secrets.  It rubs me the wrong way how Western anthropologists demand the truth from native subjects, but will tell lies left and right to those subjects whenever convenient.

Like several docs, it's stressed that the researchers must accomplish great physical feats to reach goals.  Here weak rocks, heavy rain, and foggy mornings get in the way.  Later, the viewer sees the experts fighting among themselves (although they end it with a basketball team-ish group huddle).  ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" sure has had its effect and aftermath!",1273968000,,2573,4.857471264367816
