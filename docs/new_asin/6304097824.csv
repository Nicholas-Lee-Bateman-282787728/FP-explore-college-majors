785541,4,6304097824,"Having never seen the tv-series, this movie makes me wish I could.  Cool-looking superheroine who looks like a model for products out of a bondage magazine combined with a clunky-looking, yet high-tech, morphing car makes for fun superheroine adventure.  There is some nudity, though from the editing I suspect a double was used for Severance, and even a ...scene perpetrated by the frustrated heroine! (naughty, naughty, Black Scorpion)  Don't expect too much in terms of a believable plot, especially the mechanics of her and the car's transformation into a crimefighting duo.  Severance's performance and visual appeal in heroine regalia is pleasing enough; but as for her daytime role of a police officer, not only does she come up flat, it's hard to forgive that the 35-ish actress/model is trying to play a character 10 years her junior.  Overall, superheroine lovers should still be relatively satisfied.  Beware: the DVD claims it includes a feature commentary but I could not find it.",990057600,19,993,5.175
785542,4,6304097824,"If you have a liking for B genre movies with action, a female heroine, a quasi story-line, and some nudity, then I would recommend this movie to you.  The movie starts in the real world then does a rather quick shift to  a sci-fi futuristic world.  In a scene set in 1975, a cop-father tells his  daughter, who later becomes the Scorpion, a story about a scorpion riding  on a frog across a stream.  Joan Severance's acting is a little weak in the  beginning of the movie but improves as she dons a costume and becomes the  Black Scorpion.  One of the highlights is when a disrobed Joan rides her  cop-partner to ecstasy, masked as the Scorpion.  Hence the Scorpion takes  the frog for a ride.",950659200,24,693,4.412698412698413
785543,4,6304097824,"I tell ya, I'm a sucker for a descent superhero movie.  (I'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline Batman's either)
A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist.  The  Black Scorpion can be added to that collection.
If you've seen the  Demolitionist then get this movie.  It's basically a copy of that heroine.  (It even stars the same guy in both movies)
If you haven't, then let me  explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengence.  She laces up  the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks absolutely  great on Joan Severance) and goes out to kick some booty.
It's a fun,  action packed movie, mind you, you may not wish the kids to see  it...without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty  graphice sex scene Severance has in it.  Which in my opinion, was a bonus  (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)",912384000,9,901,4.578616352201258
785704,3,6304097824,"Of the 25 movies that Roger Corman produced in 1995, Black Scorpion edges towards both the best and worst of what the man has to offer. This results in only an average rating for this review, though you should know that its an enthusiastic score nonetheless. This is a very entertaining adventure flick, made during a time before DC and Marvel monopolized superhero pictures. I would never think to directly compare it to those blockbusters, but for B-movie lovers, there is a lot to like, here.

The story: Frustrated with the ineffectual law enforcement system, a Los Angeles policewoman (Joan Severance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/See-No-Evil-Hear-No-Evil/dp/B00441GZ14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">See No Evil, Hear No Evil</a>) dons a costume and takes the fight to a super villain seeking to take control of the city (Casey Siemaszko,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-the-Future/dp/B011Q0H3JS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to the Future</a>&nbsp;series).

The film could not have had a huge budget, give the flimsy costumes, weak effects, and action scenes that look like they were shot under time constraints. Luckily, these limitations bring out the talent in producer Corman and director Jonathan Winfrey, and they make the absolutely most of what they have to work with. The screenplay is polished, completely avoiding the narrative pitfalls of other low-budget productions. The cast as a whole is enthusiastic, and you can look forward to some particularly entertaining performances from Terri Vaughn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Steve-Harvey-Show/dp/B000095WW5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Steve Harvey Show</a>) and Garrett Morris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jamie-Foxx-Show/dp/B0006N2F04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jamie Foxx Show</a>). Most important of all, the movie has that infectious enthusiasm that can turn schlock into classics: the hammy personalities, the bubbly chemistry between the cast, and the filmmakers knack for enjoyable absurdity make it clear that the movies foremost goal is to have fun, and its hard not to be at least somewhat entertained.

However, enthusiasm by itself does not make a great action movie, and this ones action content is in trouble. For all her dramatic talent, Joan Severance is clearly no martial artist and the handful of fight scenes are lucky to reach mediocrity. Equally displeasing is the films use of sexuality, which seems determined to denigrate the heroine. Yes, the movie is aware of its exploitive nature and gets all it can out of the Black Scorpions BDSM-inspired outfit, but at the same time, it tries to win points for simply having a mighty female hero. Corman is trying to have it both ways: he wants the heroine to be a strong, independent woman but also wants to titillate the audience by having her engage in a topless sex scene while in costume. Trying to fulfill both objectives seems mutually denigrating and cheapens the value of a rare female superhero flick.

Nevertheless, Joan Severance in particular ought to be proud of her work, here. She shines in one of the few productions for which she landed top billing, and while she may not be the action hero I was hoping for, her adeptness at headlining a comic book movie says much about her range as a performer.  Its hard to say whether Roger Corman has permanently retired the Black Scorpion character, but Id be happy to see Severance take up the role again, especially if its for a feature as fun as this one.",1449792000,2,3645,5.792910447761194

785711,5,6304097824,"I just watched this movie this morning, and loved it!  It's campy in the same style as the 60s Batman TV show, but there's a nice little surprise in the middle of it.  Well, it's nice unless you are watching with kids, then you might have a panic attack.  I don't want to spoil it, so all I will say is teenage boys will love it as long as they are alone in the room.  It's a shame there isn't a PG-13 rated version of the film because the rest is family friendly-ish.

This is a lot better than the TV show; just skip that.  Unlike the show, this acting is actually quite good and the special effects are tolerable considering when this was made.  I'm looking forward to getting my hands on the sequel.

If you don't like campy films with extra cheese, then you'll hate this.

Update: I finally saw Black Scorpion II.  Skip it.",1410480000,,828,4.2165605095541405

785780,3,6304097824,"The character Black Scorpion is born of comic book roots and it certainly shows in this movie. If you were expecting serious crime drama then you're looking in the wrong place. This is definitely not Black Knight Rises, but if your willing to sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy some fun action including a great looking super hero, a great looking techno-whiz of a car and some fast-paced action you ARE in the right place.

One quick warning for parents out there, this movie is rated ""R"" for good reason. Since some of the action is from the mind of Roger Corman it can get a little gruesome and sexy at points in this movie so don't let the comic book roots fool you, this is not for the kiddies.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that this 17 year old flic stood up as well as it did. Not great, not awful, just okay.",1348272000,3,827,4.329032258064516

785782,4,6304097824,This is an older movie I had rented on VHS tape several times and wanted to add it to my DVD collection. The story line is typical for a comic book character. I got more out of the movie with the actor's comments enabled during the movie. Some scenes are unnecessary for the story line.,1162684800,2,286,4.218181818181818
785783,5,6304097824,If you are a fan of the Black Scorpion you need to have this one in your collection of DVDs. This is especally true if you are planning to get the box set of the TV series (which is well worth getting) since this is the origin tale of the Black Scorpion.

785784,5,6304097824,"When looking for a fun action film, a good choice would be a film  called Black Scorpion that stars Joan Severance.  This movie was followed by a sequel and a television series.
Black Scorpion is the story of a young girl raised by a policeman father whose tactics cause him to ruin his career.  Later in life as a cop herself she finds herself in a position where she needs to find justice and the Black Scorpion is born.  Using some clothes from an undercover gig as a prostitute, and a few other additions, a costumed vigilante is created.  Just as she starts to make her mark a super-villain called The Breathtaker threatens the lives of everyone in the city.  It is up to Black Scorpion to save the day.
This movie is a well-balanced mix of action, adventure and humor.  The police chief and a con called Argyle (played by Garrett Morris) really help to make this a very enjoyable movie.  At the movie's end the viewer is left wanting to see more Black Scorpion adventures.  Unfortunately, this is the best that the series gets.  This is an R-Rated film for good reason so despite its comic-book feel, this is not one for children.",1082937600,5,1136,4.4975609756097565

This has more than a few great scenes, so if you're looking for a fast-paced time waster with ample amounts of hokey action and sexy superheroine fun, pick this one up!
