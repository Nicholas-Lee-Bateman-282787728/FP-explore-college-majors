7999117,5,B0000CEB6G,"Otherwise known as ""Shaolin Fox Conspiracy"", this is one of my favorite Kung-Fu movies. It probably inspired a lot of the more mainstream films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Flying Dagger"". Glad to see it out on DVD and not chopped to pieces like previous bootleg attempts. Recommended!",1163376000,4,308,5.0588235294117645
7999118,5,B0000CEB6G,"This movie was the best. It opens as all movies should: clever camera work and dialogue to give us an idea as to who the characters are on screen and what they want to accomplish, in a neat and timely manner. After the director feels we know who these people are and what they want, WHAM! A crazed killer pops out of no where and takes their off heads in a fountain of blood!

About half an hour later we start to sort of learn why that happened. But first, there is action galore as kung fu fighters beat the tar out of one another. It turns out its all part of a simple plan to find the Jade Ninja Weasle (or something like that), a thingy which will grant its master ultimate power! Soon factions like the Four Kings, a sex crazed ninja chick, and many more are after our hero, a martial arts Marshall. Does he have the Ninja Weasle? No. Does it matter? What are you, stupid? Of course it doesn't!

The movie finally draws to its nerve wracking (and knuckle cracking) conclusion when the Yeti attacks the Marshall! Who will win? I don't know! I still haven't figured it out, and I saw the picture. And so should you!

That is, if you don't watch this, think of all you'll miss. Like, a man being split in half like a sausage over the mighty knees of the Yeti. Also, an evil Shaolin monk (one of the Four Kings) charges the Marshall, shouting ""The Buddha said that the middle path is the true path!""

After the Marshall trounces him, he verbally counters, ""Well. It looks like Buddha was wrong."" So if you like ninjas, kung fu and the Yeti, watch this film! If you don't like that sort of thing, then what's wrong with you man?",1106265600,,1629,4.262135922330097
