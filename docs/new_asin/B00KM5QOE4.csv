8659900,5,B00KM5QOE4,Great history - very well narrated.,1517875200,,35,5.0
8659901,5,B00KM5QOE4,Saw this in the 70's before the age of VCR's and DVD's and never forgot it. Delighted to have found it on Amazon. I'm using  the Panasonic S-700P-K multi region DVD player that I also bought from Amazon specifically to play these discs. I experienced some difficulty at first with the english audio but this was due to my unfamiliarity with the disc menu as well as the player.,1479168000,,377,4.463768115942029
8659902,3,B00KM5QOE4,"It says on the box ""Sprache: deutsch, english"" which I suppose is accurate in so far as DVD 1 had German language audio only, and DVD 2 had English language audio only.  Neither DVD had subtitles, and I was unable to change DVD 1 to English audio (and I tried on 3 different DVD players).",1476921600,,288,4.236363636363636
8659903,5,B00KM5QOE4,"I had seen this program on TV, possibly on PBS when it came out decades ago. I began to actively look for it about several years ago. It seemed to be unavailable and there was speculation the BBC was embarrassed they had ever had anything to do with the story. It does tend to glorify the British Empire, and its treatment of Africans is not very PC. When I ran across it in a non-USA format I snapped it up. I bought an all regions DVD player just for this item. It is every bit as good as I remembered it. If you like exploration, explorers and their tales, buy it. One of the major characters is Mrs Baker. Her unlikely background is touched on lightly, you may wish to do a little additional research on her. Her story is worth at least a one hour documentary by itself.",1461110400,3,774,4.201342281879195
8659904,5,B00KM5QOE4,"The source of the Nile was one of the great mysteries of the 19th century. The BBC captured on film all the rivalries, turmoil, back stabbing, hatred and envy of those who endeavored to be first in the discovery of the source of this mighty river.
Why has this marvelous mini-series NEVER been available on DVD in the U.S.? (or Great Britain for that matter! ) It has everything; history, great acting, drama, humor (that marvelous British humor), cinematography (great African location shooting), and most of all a stunning central performance from Kenneth Haigh as scientist/explorer/rebel Richard Francis Burton.

First broadcast in the U.S. in 1972 on commercial T.V. (NBC) this mini-series was nominated for a Golden Globe, won an Emmy and was soon picked up by PBS which ran it many times throughout the seventies to great acclaim from it's viewers. I remember a broadcast of this mini-series during a 1973 San Francisco KQED membership pledge drive in which author Alan Mooreheads' hardcover illustrated (coffee table) version of his book ""The White Nile"" was offered as an incentive. This book was first published in 1960 and this was a revised edition printed in 1971 to coincide with the release of this mini-series. This ""tie-in"" was so successful that it quickly sold out at bookstores in the area. (and subsequently went out of print.)

In early 1980 (with the advent of VCR's/video tape) I was able to record this mini-series on PBS (commercial free) and did so on standard play with the best video tape available at the time. Little did I know that it was my last shot. After that, for all intents and purposes this mini-series COMPLETELY disappeared. I mean nothing!  The BBC has issued virtually all of it's U.S. exported programming on DVD but not this mini-series!  You can even find the BBC version (mid 70's) of ""The Last of The Mohicans"" if you look hard enough (it's laughable) but alas, no ""Search For The Nile.""

In 1990 Director Bob Rafelson released his film ""Mountains Of The Moon"" about the rivalry between Richard Burton and John Speke over the source of the Nile. The film was decent (for what it was) and well received by the critics but is a mere shadow of the BBC's mini-series. In reading some of the reviews at the time I looked for reviewer comparisons with TSFTN but there were none. It was as if ""Mountains of the Moon"" was a first and the previous mini-series never existed. Unbelievable!  I eventually had my video tape transferred onto DVD but 1980's technology is a far cry from high definition flat screen television.

Imagine my surprise when I ran across this PAL/German import on Amazon. I immediately snatched it up and not having an ""all region"" Blu-ray/DVD player I had it converted on DVD ""Region Free"". It looks and sounds very good considering how long it's been out of print (and not knowing what to expect). Some motion scenes are a little blurry (It could just be the copy) but not enough to be distracting. Overall the picture and color are solid with as good a definition as can be expected for a film that has not had a major restoration.

However, my biggest surprise with this release is that it is approximately 50 MINUTES longer than the U.S. released version. That's right, each episode (there are six) is approximately 8 to 9 minutes longer!  Remember, this was originally broadcast on commercial T.V. and each hour long (approx.) episode was edited for commercials and that is what PBS subsequently picked up. In retrospect the editing also served another purpose. Scenes were cut of bare breasted black women (in one case making love with a white explorer, remember these were the 70's), also Richard Burton unveiling, de-blousing and taunting an Arab woman while making love after his forbidden trip to Mecca. (""What do you think of this 'White Hajji' entering and leaving Mecca?"")  If a non-believer (I.E.white man) were caught in Mecca it meant crucifixion.  Also, the narrative is a little clearer with the missing footage.  Burton's strange relationship with his wife Isabel is expanded upon and the Royal Geographical Society's apology to American Explorer Henry Stanley for their insults (and envy) when it was Stanley and not the British who found Dr. David Livingstone in deepest Africa (""Dr. Livingstone, I presume.""), also was absent from the U.S. version.

The Search For The Nile is the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" of British mini-series' and Kenneth Haighs' performance as Richard Burton is in the same class with Peter O'Toole's performance as T. E. Lawrence.  Like the Lawrence restoration of the late 80's, TSFTN is made richer with the addition of missing footage. Now hopefully, we'll have a restoration to bring it into the 21st. century and maybe even a British version available in the U.S.
However, considering past history, I'll not hold my breath.",1446595200,12,4832,4.898408812729498
8659905,5,B00KM5QOE4,I think this series was the finest docudrama I have ever seen. I viewed it on PBS when it first came out and have often looked for a USA compatible DVD.,1442361600,,152,3.935483870967742
8659906,5,B00KM5QOE4,"I have not seen this film so my five-star rating is just a placeholder. I am writing this to ask, why is this film not available for U.S. DVD equipment? This film has an 8.7 rating at IMDb (apparently from people who remember it or saw a British version) and it's simply not available. WHY????????

I dug through the IMDb reviews and found the following (next paragraph). Can it be accurate?????? Political correctness is NOT a reasonable basis for withholding a fine historical film from a viewership starved for connection to the past:

""Quite a few of the best BBC films have been locked away. There is a possibility that, in the minds of a very politically correct and left leaning BBC upper management, the advertising of Empire and Africa is not a truth that should be allowed anymore. The standard of documentary's, and that of the news itself for which the BBC used to be renowned, has been lowered dramatically over the past 20 years. The BBC are ashamed of British involvement in Africa in the nineteenth Century and do their best to make certain that any programs which reflect otherwise are not available. It's a great pity. No quality anymore just proselytizing. The BBC is being systematically dumbed down to make certain it reflects a government view of the world.""",1441584000,5,1280,4.761261261261262
