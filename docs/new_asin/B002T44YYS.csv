8379787,2,B002T44YYS,"Course two isn't as bad as 1 and 3. However, the dramatic music doesn't fit with the low budget self made video.  This project isn't shown from the start of the project. You can't learn how to lay out the portrait from this tutorial. His explanation is that it takes him like a week or so to do one and can't video everything. So he has everything already laid out and teaches you how to blend smudge and erase your way to completion. All the steps leading up to the likeness is left out. Basically he is teaching you x, y and z. A - W are left out.  The video itself is a low budget self made product. Frankly, if your going to make me sit through it you could at least teach the project from START to completion.  Having said all that, I think the artist has talent, his portrait is very nice, I would hang it on my wall.",1326240000,,823,4.067901234567901
8379788,1,B002T44YYS,"The process that is imperfectly demonstrated on the ""Extreme Realism Drawing Course II"" DVD involves copying significant points and contours from a photograph onto a sheet of drawing paper by using grids.  These are used as guides for completing the image through a laborious process (said to take 80 to 100 hours) using the typical tools of a pencil draftsman.  This DVD is a low budget production; apparently the author, George Roland Wills is both the performer and the cameraman.

A basic question is whether the final product is worthwhile.  Unfortunately, the quality of the video isn't good enough to show the subtleties of either the photograph or the picture that is created.  The ""Extreme Realism""  DVDs are associated with an art school called ""Gallery513"", which currently has a website.  From those images, I conjecture that the pictures are highly detailed portraits with somewhat exaggerated highlights, which give the skin of the subjects a slightly shiny appearance.

Another question is whether a person interested in this process can learn it from the DVD.  The answer is no.  Purely visual demonstrations of an image being created by doing layer upon layer of shading, blending and erasing are not very informative.  In such a demonstration it is not clear what part the layering is intended as a deliberate effect and what part is to obscure or remove errors that were made in previous layers.  Unless the person doing the work can clearly articulate what is being done, the viewer doesn't learn anything except that the process will take patience.  In the case of ""Extreme Realism Drawing Course II"", the video is not clear enough to show sufficient detail and although Mr. Wills chats about a great many things and makes cogent observations about the details of the photograph, he does not explain the purpose of his layers well.

An irritating flaw in the presentation is that Mr. Wills gives a tedious explanation of grids and how they may be drawn with rulers, but then he jumps into the process of working on the image without clearly explaining or showing which contours and points he has chosen to transfer from the photograph.

Mr. Wills speaks with a marked Southern accent.  His remarks betray that he is familiar with many details of traditional drawing such as anatomy and the artist's classifications of various forms of light and shadow.  However, as is typical of many Southern gentleman, he is dismissive of his own education.  He speaks its terms as if he is not really willing to adopt them as part of his own language.  Having been raised in the South myself, I know that such men ought not to be entirely dismissed.  They always present a quandary.  What part of them is arrogance and nonsense and what part has some skill and wisdom?  You won't be able to sort this out by watching the DVD.

I rate the DVD one star out of five to indicate that it isn't a helpful explanation of the ""Extreme Realism"" process.",1271635200,3,2952,4.836653386454183
