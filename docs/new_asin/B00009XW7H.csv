7994279,5,B00009XW7H,"Coming close to the end of an era before Disney and everyone else (Fred Flintstone) got into economy animation at the end of the '50s, this gem was a production of the famous four and Mary Blair.  Expressions and demeanor are portrayed in animation almost better than real life.  Some refer to Disney's team as the nine old men out of which I choose four.  Who could beat the narration of Basil Razzledazzle?",1384214400,,408,4.561643835616438
7994280,5,B00009XW7H,"This is a PAL DVD (25 frames per second) for Region 2, will not play in a US DVD player.  However, it doesn't matter to me since I was only going to use it with Handbrake to make a digital copy for watching on home theater media pc (macmini).  The picture is progressive coded, not interlaced, the vertical resolution is higher than on NTSC DVDs, so the quality is better than US releases.",1379030400,,389,4.315068493150685
