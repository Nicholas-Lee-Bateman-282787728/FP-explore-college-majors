7127099,1,B00WAJ8PA6,"No Blu-Ray option, shame on Disney for making me purchase the movie on DVD with bare bones special features! This is 2015 and it's a total cash grab to make this the only version released, disgusted.",1435536000,3,199,4.555555555555555
7127100,1,B00WAJ8PA6,Wasn't what I was expecting.  While the music was great the whole theme of the movie was off - especially the ending.  I would have thought the movie would have been about the cast that suddenly appeared on the beach at the end of the first movie.  About how they adjusted to life now instead of living in the movie.  Very disappointing.,1435536000,3,337,4.387096774193548
7127101,5,B00WAJ8PA6,"We ended up watching this movie together as a family and we loved it! While the kids said that they still thought the first movie was better, I will say that we all loved the premise of the movie, the music and the characters. Also, the end message of the movie was powerful and allows all girls and really anyone to see and hear when it comes to writing your own story and not being constrained to what is ""written"" for you. Get ready to smile, tap your feet and hum along - you will love this!

7127102,1,B00WAJ8PA6,"The movie was going great until the ending. I REALLY hated it because the whole point of the movie was Mack and Brady bonding over their memories on the beach, especially their experience in the Wet Side Story film from the first Teen Beach Movie. I just don't understand why the filmmakers had to make it look like the two of them never met each other. Honestly, it kind of ruined the magic of the first film which kind of made the second movie very depressing. I would like for someone to let me know what the whole point of this film was because no matter how many times I think about it, I just don't understand it. This movie did have decent music and dancing, but in my opinion, I wish this movie had never been made because the ending was not only upsetting, but it generally did not make any sense at all.",1435536000,2,813,4.251612903225807
7127103,5,B00WAJ8PA6,"Ok I bought this at target for the same price and it is so great it comes with a necklace along with so called dance rehearsals but they are only  the Cast talking about the dances they had to do and fast little snips of rehearsals so don't buy if u just wanna see the rehearsals it's not really rehearsals at all So now about the NECKLACE  it is great I love it so much it is detailed if u care about that and the pearls are so pretty I love them and it does have adjustable clasp it is great it's almost like the one in the movie but it is more stiffer and a little bigger but it's fine for me  Now the movie, movie is great but the first one is way better  thank you for reading ",1435449600,,682,3.842857142857143

7127105,3,B00WAJ8PA6,"Summer is ending for Brady (Ross Lynch) and Mack (Maia Mitchell), which means theyve been dating 3 months now.  They have completely bonded over Wet Side Story and their adventure when they found themselves in the movie.  However, navigating their new relationship at school proves to be harder than they thought, especially since Mack is so driven by academics and Brady is hiding a secret.

Meanwhile, inside the world of Wet Side Story, things are going wrong as well.  Lela (Grace Phipps) has grown disenchanted with her part in the movie.  Sure, shes the female lead, but she wants more than just wanting a guy.  When she swims off into the ocean, followed by male lead Tanner (Garrett Clayton), the craziest thing happens  they find themselves in the real world.  Now Brady and Mack have to figure out a way to convince the two characters to return home before they and the movie are erased from existence.

Since I enjoyed the first one, I was looking forward to this sequel.  The plot was hinted at with the tag scene of the last film, and it was fun to see how they actually pulled it off.  They made lots of references to the first, which is great for the fans, although they did change Brady and Macks relationship some, which was too bad.

There are several new songs, and they are plenty of fun.  The choreography is great as well.  The acting is on par with the earlier film, which means some of the characters are over the top, but they are supposed to be given the genre of film we are spoofing.

Then comes the ending.  Not to give anything away, but it left me flat.  I get what they wanted to do theme wise, but I don't like what it did to two of the main characters.  They tried to make it up, but it just wasn't what it should have been given the genre of the film.

The ending is enough to make me hesitate to watch this film again, but most of the movie is still quite enjoyable.",1435363200,20,1902,4.367521367521367

There was so much potential for his development and emotional growth, but they relegated him to a ken doll joke.

So disappointed. The 1st movie was very well done, campy but well done.

This one felt like they wrote a good script and threw up on it, then didn't wipe off the mess.",1488758400,,425,4.367088607594937

7127183,2,B00WAJ8PA6,"The trouble with Teen Beach 2 is just this: it feel as though the creators of Teen Beach Movie thought: ""The last one was a great success! We have to do a sequel. What can we do? Let's send characters from Wet Side Story into the real world!"" It's a great concept, but it was executed extremely poorly.

All the actors are back to reprise their roles and they do a fairly decent job with the material they have. However, that material is shoe-horned together for an almost 2 hour long slow, slow, slow romp through tropes and cliches. The only high points come when songs occur and the choreography is highly impressive.

The story here is bogged down with faulty logic and quick jumps to conclusions. For instance, throughout the movie, the magic necklace is mentioned but there is no reason for this necklace to do what it does. Same with the surfboard emblem. It makes no sense. And near the end when characters and poofing out of existence, a couple characters take so much longer to disappear than any of the others. Also, there is one song plastered right into the panic of getting characters home that made no sense why they were singing at all.

Granted, this is a DCOM, but still. Movies like Descendants thought through their worlds long enough to make sure they weren't slapping something together for the sake of a sequel.

Skip this one and just go back and rewatch Teen Beach Movie.",1445644800,,1396,4.572

7127248,5,B00WAJ8PA6,"Much better than the first. However Grace Phipps and Garret Clayton steal the show in this one. Not sure if it's poor writing, poor direction or just that Ross Lynch is a dancer and not an actor. ""Brady"" & ""Mac"" were unwatchable in this film. I suffered through the first 18 or so minutes until the setting returned to Wet Side Story. The chemistry between ""Lela"" & ""Tanner"" was off the charts. The plot that pulled ""Mac"" & ""Brady"" apart was really unnecessary and annoying. The writers made ""Brady"" look like a complete idiot and ""Mac"" a total nasty girl who clearly had no more interest in ""Brady.""

Meanwhile they tried to convince audiences that ""Spencer"" (Ross Butler) is attractive (definitely not) and has the hots for ""Mac"" (blatantly, yet she is too dumb to notice) yet while he ignores her geeky friend ""Alyssa"" (Piper Curda who has the hots for him) ... yet for some unexplainable reason the two of them get together at the end? How does that add up?

If there is a Teen Beach 3, Disney, please do everyone a favor, ditch Ross ""Over-rated"" Lynch and Maia Mitchell and focus on Grace Phipps and Garret Clayton. Combined with Josh DeLuca, Chrissie Fit the rest of the 60's cast is amazing. How about we actually get to see Lela Queen of the Beach? If I have to watch another Teen Beach movie where they spend the entire movie pitching how amazing Ross Lynch is, I'll pass.

In closing, someone needs to inform Ross that if he keeps bleaching out his hair by the time he's 20 it will look 85.",1439769600,,1500,4.487179487179487

After a wonderful summer together, Brady and Mack (Mackenzie) are heading back to school together.  Even though they're celebrating their three month ""meetaversary"", their relationship is about to be seriously tested as they discover that they are complete opposites when it comes to their academic studies.

Mack has her future planned out with wanting to become a marine biologist.  She already knows which college she wants to go to while Brady doesn't even know what he's going to have for dinner at night.  Even though biology isn't Brady's strongest subject, he's not stupid.  In fact, he's designing many great surfboards.  The problem is that he's lost his confidence and doesn't want to share his passion with his girlfriend for fear of being rejected.

Other guys are taking notice of Mackenzie and Brady is getting jealous of the attention she is getting.  Between the jealousy and the secrets, Mack is wanting some time away from Brady.  Back in Brady's favorite '60s movie, Wet Side Story (a surfers versus bikers rendition of West Side Story), the main characters Lela and Tanner are sensing some trouble between Mack and Brady and come to the future (our present day) to save them.
Hilarity ensues when Lela and Tanner arrive and don't know how to interact with cell phones, scuba divers, and aggressive jocks.  They try their best to blend in and sing whenever the opportunity arises.  Just like the first Teen Beach movie, the sequel is very much a musical.

Lela is adjusting well to the modern era and enjoys discovering her true self and untapped intellect.  Tanner on the other hand is very conceited and flaky.  Later, he does come around and learn to put others before himself.  Other lessons include being and believing in yourself and not keeping secrets from a loved one.

If your family enjoyed the first movie, the sequel is worth checking out.  It's kid safe and my children enjoyed the movie even though they are not teenagers yet.  The wacky humor and silly songs were enough to keep them tuned in.  My daughters fought over the included necklace which is rather stylish.  The price is a reasonable $15, and if you don't like the movie, you still get a nice necklace out of the deal.",1437264000,,2278,4.819587628865979

The whole premise of the sequel is based on something that never happened in the original. The leads did not meet on the beach and watch ""Wet Side Story."" Mac walks in on Brady and her grandfather working on surfboards and watching the movie on TV--and she gags. She hated the movie until she found herself in it, and it wasn't until the end she made peace with it. Why this sequel decided to change a key element of the original just makes no logical sense. Then the whole plot of Brady and Mac being nervous about how they will act with each other at school and who they'll be... that's just so implausible that a teen mind would even think that way.

7127332,4,B00WAJ8PA6,"Before we get to Teen Beach 2, lets go back to 1966, there was a CBS sitcom called Its About Time. Created by Sherwood Schwartz, the escapism-era series was about two astronauts who travel back in time meet a wacky stone age family. Later in the season, the premise was reversed, and the cave people ended up in modern times, adjusting to newfangled life in zany ways.

That sums up the twist in the sequel to the highly-successful (and highly entertaining) Teen Beach Movie, an unabashedly silly musical comedy TV movie in which two teens are transported inside a 1962 beach movie (for diehard fans of the genre, the first actual Beach Party film was released in 1963). They had tissue-thin romance problems and a tangle with a Vincent Price-like mad scientist.

The new sequel reverses the story and takes the two 1962 movie teens (and members of their cast, eventually) into a 2015 rendered in as gritty and cynical style as Disney Channel can muster. At the same time, our modern-day couple is having relationship issues. Things get tense when it becomes apparent that the 1962 movie might vanish entirely, along with the charactersand the 2015 couple will have never met and fallen in love!! Will it all turn out okay. Maybe I shouldnt tell.

The sequel is certainly chock full of comedy and excellent song and dance set pieces, but, perhaps because it takes place in todays real world, it does not get as loose and campy as its predecessor. The songs, though, are just as good and eclectic. There is enough of all possible rock and pop tunes to satisfy kids and the parents and grandparents who love the earlier eras. The music alone is a strong reason these movies seem to work so well.

The DVD contains some rehearsal footage, and thats about it for any bonus features. For parents concerned about questionable material, this being a Disney Channel movie, there is pretty much nothing of concern. It might be worth noting that the original beach movies, squeaky-clean as they were, had some nudge-nudge material in them. All of them are pure escapism that are so knowing about their silliness, they sometimes break the fourth wall to remind us that they're in on the jokes with us.",1436140800,3,2190,4.74015748031496
7127333,5,B00WAJ8PA6,"Theres a lot to love about this movie.
It picks up where Teen Beach Movie left off. Mack and Brady are celebrating their three month anniversary and then the summer romance shifts to trying to balance the relationship with school. School is where they learn they are different and it causes a strain on their relationship, causing a break up.
Meanwhile in Wet Side Story world , Lela seeks more girl power and she and Tanner visit Mack and Brady.
The adventure really begins and the storyline moves along through songs, dancing and a fun plot.",1436140800,,543,4.666666666666667

7127335,2,B00WAJ8PA6,"I'll start this review by saying that I liked the first Teen Beach movie and was hoping for the same in the second.  However, the movie goes fine until the Silver Screen song.  After that song, I recommend turning off the TV.  From there, nothing about school is added and the ending is terrible.  Lela goes back, after suddenly deciding to leave, even though she wanted to stay with Brady and Mack just a second earlier.  The she changes the movie and Brady and Mack meet again and (of coarse) there is a dance number.  I would say the songs aren't as good as the first movie and the surprise ending ruined both movies for me.",1436054400,,627,4.362068965517241

8712613,4,B00WAJ8PA6,"This is a sequel to the earlier ""Teen Beach Movie"" a parody of the 1960s beach party movies,  starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon (7 of them!!).  The movie is great fun even if you haven't seen the old ones.  If you have you will especially enjoy the various allusions to the original series.  The production values are way better than the originals and the meta references (the characters are aware they are in  a  movie) are fun too.  Highly recommended for the not-to-serious minded viewer.  Great cinema they are not but great fun they are.",1533772800,,554,4.697916666666667
