7445437,5,B015ONJ4Y0,"Karol Szymanowskis opera Krl Roger (King Roger) was written in the period 1918-1924, and received its premiere performance in Warsaw in 1926. The work is a skillful blend of psychological, political and religious themes, but its a personal testament as well. In this complex master-work of the operatic stage the composer presents lifelong philosophical musings, and his own sexual longings, in an idealized Mediterranean setting common to northern European artists since Goethe and Schumann.

The opera is full of multicultural references and effects, with an unusually broad range of influences apparent in its libretto (by the composer and his cousin Jarosaw Iwaszkiewicz) and the music itself. Some that occur to me, or have been suggested in my reading, are Oscar Wilde, Walter Pater and Thomas Mann on the literary side; Stravinskys early ballets and Wagners Tristan and Parsifal on the musical side; and Euripedes Bacchantes (Szymanowskis explicit model) and Shakespeares Hamlet, The Tempest and King Lear on the dramatic side. The over-arching philosophical structure comes, of course, from Nietschzes dichotomy between the reasonable Apollonian and the instinctive Dionysian natures of humans and Gods. Finally, the religious ecosystem of the opera is a syncretistic mixture of Eastern Mystery rites, ancient and Byzantine Greek and ancient and Catholic Roman faiths, with Muslim influences from the Sicilian locale. As Pater put it in Marius the Epicurean, A blending of all the religions of the ancient world had been accomplished.

All of this might come crashing down in an eclectic heap were it not for Szymanowskis extraordinarily cogent libretto and his arresting sound world and musical development. Even then, there are lots of ways a production of King Roger could founder, from problems with the cast, chorus, orchestra, production conception or stage design. Luckily, all of those components are top drawer in this excellent recent Royal Opera House Covent Garden production headed by Director Kasper Holten.

The principals are especially good. Kim Begley is very effective as Rogers advisor, part Tom Hagen consigliere, part Sigmund Freud therapist. Georgia Jarman is always sexy as the Queen, though often slightly demented, and shes great in Roxanas big second act aria - the most sensuous 20th century music for soprano until Villa-Loboss 5th Bachianas Brasileiras. Salmir Pirgu is a delightful Shepherd, coming on full-charismatic guru, then pulling back as a detached, cynical con-man. In the final scene he channels the Commendatore from Don Giovannni, calling the protagonist to a different kind of end:

I'm calling you to an endless journey,
to a joyous dance!
To me! To me!
I'm calling you!

As the dramaturg John Lloyd Davies points out in his excellent liner note essay, the work is very much about the titular character, and this production of King Roger is blessed with the gifted singer and actor Mariusz Kwiecie, who presented a similarly tortured main character in the Royal Operas superb recent production of Don Giovanni (another collaboration with Holten.) Every bit of the Kings doubts and enthusiasms, his longings and hesitations, is projected on Kwiecies face or through his voice. The entire production is exceptional, from Holtens concept to the stage and lighting design and choreography. The singing (and acting) of the chorus is strong, as is the playing of the Royal Opera House Orchestra under Antonio Pappano. The Opus Arte presentation makes full use of the audio and visual capabilities of Blu ray and includes fascinating special features, most interestingly an audio commentary by Holten and Pappano. This is a demonstration disc in so many ways, and most importantly a demonstration of the enduring dramatic and intellectual power of opera.",1451433600,14,3800,5.369127516778524

7445439,4,B015ONJ4Y0,"There are so many things I DID like about this piece, let's begin with those! Kwiecien was a wonderful Roger, and Pirgu, whose voice I did not know, was a beautiful Shepherd. Kim Begley, sang with stunningly accurate Polish, unfortunately much better than that of Roxana. Jarman's voice was beautiful and extremely expressive, but the tessitura of the piece combined with her lack of attention to linguistics, rendered the Polish unrecognizable. All were capable actors. Antonio Pappano, the British/Italian/American conductor was flawless in his passion for the score. Szymonowski's work seemed to alternate between lyricism and nightmarish episodes. Many moments were truly beautiful. From the beginning, the set upstaged the entire production. It was sometimes used effectively. The second act depicted the inside of the head and a series of metal frames and staircases that were meant to represent a library. The presence of books did not help in that effort. The ""symbolism"" was immediately recognizable, but outlived its welcome as it detracted from the singers as they climbed and descended. The presence of the lusty male corps de ballet at the base of the staircase was not used to create an illusion of lust or sensuality, but more a feeling of desperation and a need for survival. The least effective moment was the re-entry of the chorus during Roxana's scena. They sauntered into their semi-circle and got there just in time for their entrance. Yes, it was a good effort. But it has not been my favorite production from Covent Garden of late. The orchestra and chorus were in first-rate form. Extras include comments by Conductor, Director, and Designer. Since liner notes provide no information on the artists, it would be appropriate to include a short biography on each. Photos of leading singers are featured. Misspelling on Mariusz Kwiecien's page should be corrected.",1449360000,8,1886,5.207236842105263

8734138,5,B015ONJ4Y0,"Hauntingly beautiful, slightly dissonant music. Timeless controversial themes of self-discipline vs. hedonism in the individual and authoritarianism vs. anarchy in society, and how does one navigate these to a healthy state? I loved the giant head (of the king) that dominated the stage, especially when it turned to the back and put us literally inside the head of the king. The singers were excellent. The visual quality of the Blue-Ray was excellent. This is an amazing production of an amazing opera!",1507680000,,504,5.234567901234568

8734142,5,B015ONJ4Y0,"Hands down Royal Opera's HD webcast of Krl Roger was the easily most fascinating and beautiful HD of any performance I watched this season, and that its arrived on Bluray is cause for rejoicing.

Kasper Holten's production (along with his lighting, set designer and costumers) laid to rest any notion of Syzmanowski's work being ""more oratorio than opera."" Here was compelling drama drawing one into this incredible score, and, literally and figuratively, into the head of its protagonist. Within the ""stage"" area of an ancient ampitheatre, designer Steffen Aarfing created an enormous, three-story, head wherein the opera's first two acts (mostly) occur. Subtlety was here neither necessary, nor welcome to the use of symbolism, yet still one didn't feel as though being banged over the head with obviousness.

Georgia Jarman's strong good looks, her blonde locks pinned under a Louise Brooks bob, created a stunning Roxana, compelling in action and gorgeous vocalizing (indeed, much of Roxana's music in the second act is a wordless vocalise).

Kim Begley's voice has a bit more of a spread to it these days, but his Edrisi was a powerful force in the staging, both as participant and commentator.

The casting and direction of Saimir Pirgu as The Shepherd was a stroke of genius and one of the strongest reasons for the success of this production. Almost glowing in his orange coat/robe and white trousers, his very presence was welcoming though one could easily see why Roger would be threatened and wary. The sometimes high flying role presented little in the way of problems for Pirgu who sailed through the score with ease earning a hearty applause at his curtain.

The dancers - a troupe of mud smeared, men in tighty-whitey's at first bothered me but did fit into the action, bringing a hypnotic quality to the proceedings that was as unavoidable as Roger's journey.

As Roger, Mariusz Kwiecien, if not in his absolute greatest voice (he was ill during the run) nonetheless offers a performance of such searing intensity, and beauty and puts before us a frightened, tormented ruler who held out his resistance until the end. only reluctantly - almost entirely against his will, until unable to do otherwise, accept the message of the power-hungry monster who presents himself as The Shepherd, as Roger sings, ""the King has become a pilgrim . . . The King has become a beggar.""

Antonio Pappano, a cheerleader for Szymanowski's opera, leads the Royal Opera forces (including a marvelous schoolboy choir) in a powerful performance, likely as strong a reading as one is going to encounter.  Also included is the intermission feature of an illuminating discussion from the piano analyzing and explaining the score.  Also not be missed.

SPOILER:
The final scene, played out before the amphitheater, the head now gone, (more symbolism) and smoldering fires, flames shooting in the dark, as Roger (no pun intended) ""see's the light,"" was pure heart-in-your-throat theatre. Here, Kwiecien's Roger, beaten in body, rises for the king's last line ""And, from the lonely depths of my power, I pluck my pure heart to offer to the sun in sacrifice,"" hanging onto that final, powerful note longer than the orchestra, as blinding light explodes across the stage. The effect, the singing and general music-making causing the audience to erupt into cheers, shouts and applause while the music was still hanging in the air. When the curtain rose on Kwiecien alone, it was one of those moments one sensed that neither he, nor the audience will ever forget. I certainly shall not",1464998400,3,3568,5.042444821731749

8734146,5,B015ONJ4Y0,"I purchased this upon discovering that this work is modeled after Euripides ""Bachae"".  Though this work has a slightly different conclusion, I found the music to be intense and an expression of personal agony as Szymonowski seeks to come to a workable integration between his controlling logic versus free emotional response to his world.  This is a powerful dramatization of the Nietschean envisioning of this primal need we all have to become fully self actualizing human beings balancing passion and reason..  I am writing this 24 hours after watching this video, and I am still feeling the passion erupting from me as I am asking and considering these same  questions I asked  as a young man 50 years ago. At this moment, I believe this work is one of the greatest unheralded musical works of the 20th century, and I am so thankful to have been given, by this wonderful production, the opportunity to experience it.",1456272000,7,919,4.865384615384615
