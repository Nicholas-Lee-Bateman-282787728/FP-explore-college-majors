8133132,2,B000GIXE6I,"This work covers two dynamics.  First, it speaks of how companies use bankruptcy to gut pension promises.  Second, it explains how 401(k)'s went from a small retirement option to the leading one, and why that's a problem.  These issues may be of interest to many.

Still, I was expecting something entirely different when seeing the title ""Can You Afford to Retire?""  This work is focused on baby boomers in the private sector.  I watched this as a trigenarian in order to think long-term, but there is a strong chance that this may be a generation problem.  The work didn't focus on the entire population.  As Americans live longer, maybe they should work longer.  As a larger percentage of persons are elderly, public policy may need to change about retirement.  With more ""brain"" compared to ""brawn"" jobs and better accommodation of the disabled, maybe work settings can be made more comfortable for aging workers.  This work says nothing about Social Security and I really think a huge part of the populace isn't advance enough to think of other payment options besides that one.

The work was diverse in terms of region: covering persons in the South, Nebraska, and on the West Coast.  There is gender diversity as well.  The most awesome interviewee was a female professor from Boston College.  One male interviewee could really benefit from a faceliftypoo, though.  Though they showed people of color in the background, every expert and quotidian employee was Caucasian.  Are the viewers supposed to think retirement is just a white concern?  Are baby boomers of color somehow better off?  I question that and criticize the work for its lack of racial diversity.

I remain skeptical for another reason.  Frontline showed an installment called ""The Merchants of Cool"" that I found to be sensationalist and ageist against the young.  I wonder if the ""Retirement?"" episode may be just as inaccurate a representation of the aging.",1173830400,5,1933,4.993730407523511
