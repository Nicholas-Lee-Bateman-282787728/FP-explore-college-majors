8412855,5,B0041KKZFK,"Relentlessly grim, gut wrenching documentary on Veterans afflicted by PTSD, from the Civil War right through Iraq.

A plea for more care to be given to soldiers' minds, with estimates in the film of numbers as high as 30% of all soldiers
being affected by PTSD. Indeed one active army psychiatrist says he doesn't know how any man or woman could see
much active battle and not be deeply scarred, unless they were dead inside to begin with.

The individual stories are all tremendously affecting, all so different, and yet all the same at the core, from aging WWII veterans
openly weeping looking back to their shattered post-war lives, to a Civil War soldier's series of letters charting his decent from
wide-eyed optimism into suicidal despair, to an Iraq veteran's family trying to hold it together with their deeply damaged father
not the same man who left for war. Suicide. or the threat of it hovers close for all these men and women.

It's not an anti-military film. Indeed the film credits the modern army for at least admitting this is a real problem and trying to find
better ways to help soldiers cope. But to paraphrase one mother in the film, until the army spends as much time and effort helping
these men heal as it does turning them into killing machines, and exposing them to things no one should ever have to see (a phrase
that rings through the film like a mantra) the destruction of souls will continue unabated.

How interesting and powerful to see a film that's pro-soldier but anti-war.  And really, is there any better way to be pro-solider? To
appreciate what they do by trying to protect them the best we can, and by avoiding war and putting them in harm's way unless it's
absolutely and completely unavoidable?  And to do all that we can to repay them with adequate care and attention, and the funds
and social will doing so takes.",1349222400,,1857,4.646341463414634
