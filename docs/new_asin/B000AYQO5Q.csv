Deja vu for most Kiwi's...this is the story about a young woman (Genevieve McClean), her sister (Gentiane Lupi) and a friend (Loren Horsley of Eagle v. Shark fame) on their OE (overseas excursion for those uninitiated in kiwi culture). The group of travellers start out in London, buy a van, and agree to take fellow Kiwi Scott along for the ride after meeting him in a pub. The movie is filmed as a quasi-documentary, faux reality tv show, with the documentary film making crew playing a role in the plot. Scott (played by Jason Whyte) introduces a dynamic to the group which tests the bonds of sister and friend. He sleeps with all three girls and is found to be dealing drugs to finance the trip.

This movie wasn't liked by a lot of reviewers-I suspect because the plot is too familar, almost boring for Kiwis. And the drama can hit close to home-the fighting seems real and can be hard to watch. This isn't a light hearted film.  It was billed as a comedy and I think that's part of the reason people were disappointed with this pretty good film. There are a lot of good aspects to this movie, but it's a drama and you should be prepared for some serious moments. While the drinking, drugs and sex never get too dark, they do lend an aspect to this film that is unsettling. Viewers in America are likely to find this aspect of Kiwi culture amusing, but Kiwis may find this story a little too close for comfort.",1204761600,5,1447,4.432330827067669
