8585847,5,B00CSUBND8,This is a great set of routines for anyone looking to start a yoga practice or add some yoga to their existing work out routines. I normally do Insanity Max 30 but needed to increase flexibility and have something for my recovery days. As someone who used to do a lot of yoga this dvd has helped me reincorporate it into my life and the programs compliment my other work outs really well.,1465257600,,388,4.328767123287672
