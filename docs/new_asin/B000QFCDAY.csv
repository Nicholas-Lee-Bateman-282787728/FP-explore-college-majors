2837832,2,B000QFCDAY,"Mid life crisis Tim Taylor, a son that has gone from adorable to woah and completed hot rod what more can a show include to be as epic oh I know the granite guy! This season hold on to have your childhood memories be crushed all over again, while this season isn't as bad as other shows it still doesn't live up to what you've come to expect from Home Improvement, in fact the first few episodes hold up well but after sending a BBQ into space the shark has been jumped and there is no return, This season is so all over the map that you'll find yourself questioning yourself what happened to the family I've come to feel apart of or if its just ABC hiring terrible writers.  Worth adding to your collection but don't expect as many epic memories as a the jet powered long mower from season two or tongue stuck to a hammer.",1439596800,,823,4.208860759493671

Hubby and I love re-watching this family-friendly show with our kids. By now we've come to know Tim's family closely, seen his three boys grow up. Only one more season left! Fortunately for Tim Allen fans, another show named ""Last Man Standing"" is currently in its third season, this time Tim has three daughters",1389571200,,481,4.950617283950617
2837866,5,B000QFCDAY,"I have always been a fan of Tim Allen and the Home Improvement TV Series. I bought this series because I enjoy the antics of the tv family in semi-everyday life situations, and the comical aspects of how they handle everyday life. The show is no longer being aired in my area of the country, so I purchased the entire series.",1388793600,,325,4.344262295081967

2837869,5,B000QFCDAY,I invested in all the seasons of this show. The tv programming is mostly junk and depressing. We need more humor and moral teaching as this show portrays.,1371168000,,154,4.535714285714286

2837880,3,B000QFCDAY,"I love Home Improvement, have been a fan since it was originally on tv. I had big problems when I went to watch the dvd though. Season 6 & 7 have let me down. Season 6 the dvd wouldn't work. Season 7 has had problems as well. I couldn't choose the play all option otherwise it would freeze, no biggie I will just select each episode, but then during the show it would skip, very bad skips, you miss a lot of the episode it happens to. I love the show, just not impressesed with the dvd. I will have to return this item and hopefully the replacement will work, otherwise I'm going somewhere else for my season 7.",1348358400,,611,4.142857142857143
2837881,5,B000QFCDAY,Purchased this as a gift for my brother.  Can hardly wait for Christmas as this is the only set that he is missing from his collection.  This was his favorite show at one time...he can relate to fix it fiasco s.,1324166400,,211,4.121951219512195
2837882,4,B000QFCDAY,"My wife loves ""Home Improvement"".  I don't know if it's because she has a real deep connection with Jill (what does that say about my home improvement jobs?) but because she enjoys it so much we have bought all seasons up to seven.

The seventh season is not nearly as good as the early years but what sitcom ever is?  Even in decline ""Home Improvement"" would rule the TV airwaves because of the lack of a good clean, family-centered, funny show on TV.

The fact that 2 and 1/2 Men has any ratings at all shows how far we've fallen since Home Improvement has been on the air.",1320192000,3,575,4.296296296296297

2837884,5,B000QFCDAY,"This is one of my favorite shows to watch when it is on TV, so I figured why not watch it whenever I want to.  Love all the extra features on the discs and is so much fun to watch.  Great for anyone who loves Home Improvement.  Would highly recommend.  Not disappointed at all.",1299974400,,277,4.074074074074074
2837885,4,B000QFCDAY,"i first got the thirth season on a cool box set, but this seventh season comes inside an average plastic case, what is it too expensive to produce quality products? this is the problem of buying online, you never really know what you are purchasing",1282953600,,248,4.533333333333333
2837886,5,B000QFCDAY,This show always found me a way to continue laughing all the way to season 8. I recommend this TV show to everyone who enjoys watching comedy with a family involved.,1278806400,,165,4.354838709677419
2837887,4,B000QFCDAY,"I just checked my order status on Home Improvement Season 7, and it said it was shipped on Feb. 5; well, I received it on Feb. 6! That's awesome service (standard shipping, not special). I notice that the episodes I've watched so far are rather intense, what with Tim going through mid-life crisis (though he denies this, of course), Jill under more pressure because of college, and the fact that her mom is dating so soon after her dad's death, and Mark in his ""goth"" period. However, the laughs are still there so I'm happy with that. What do I mean by ""weird-looking"" in the title? I've seen other reviewers make the same comment: it seems that every other frame was cut out (for cost-cutting purposes?), so the show sometimes seems surreal, like a dream. Also, I noticed (perhaps because of this cutting?) that the audio only just matches the characters mouth movements; it's like they're off just a bit, and if you try hard enough not to notice, it may not make a difference, but I've noticed it more than I wanted. If this was a cost-cutting procedure, I'd have preferred to pay a few more dollars for better quality (as in the first few seasons). All in all, though, I'm satisfied with the purchase: prompt delivery, discs in great condition, a bit weird-looking at times, but, as always, a great show; AND the completion of my collection!",1265500800,3,1346,4.635983263598327

2837890,5,B000QFCDAY,"This is Tim ""The Toolman"" Taylor, version 7.0, or at least the Complete Seventh Season.  Good wholesome American humor. The Taylor clan (read:cast) are legitimately funny.

2837891,5,B000QFCDAY,"The series is great. All the actors act great, the ""big ones"", the ""extras"". The stories always are great. The show even improved from season to season: great entertainment.

The grat part of this season is how the kids are grown now, for people who followed the series  for some time, is nostalgic to see the walk of life.

I get the image that Buena Vista doesn't really care any more about the quality of the sets. You recognize that because of the minor package quality of that set in comparison to the quality of earlier seasons.
It's sad cause the show is still the most hilarious show ever produced. Well, but it's just not entertaining if can't watch it! :-(",1193097600,5,474,4.337078651685394

2837902,5,B000QFCDAY,Home Improvement TV series continues to bring lots of laughs. If you have enjoyed the past seasons of this TV show you will definely keep laughing. If you are alwasy curious of what sorts of stunts and acts that Tim Allen pulls sometimes at the expense of Al or himself you are in for a treat. This season is great. While you will notice some of the same things that have always made the show a success you will be pleasently surprised with new and improved pranks and stunts. I would highly recommend it to any Home Improvement fan!!,1190678400,,534,4.404040404040404
