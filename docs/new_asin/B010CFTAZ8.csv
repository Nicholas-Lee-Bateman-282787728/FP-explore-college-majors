8721864,3,B010CFTAZ8,"In the world of Taiwanese televised dramas, there is a sizable segment that centers the romantic tension of the Handsome Rich guy and the Beautiful but Poor Girl in the midst of a variety of debilitating diseases and non-villainous villains. SOMEONE LIKE YOU is a sterling example of how not to combine them. Director Chen Rong-hui cobbles together the aforementioned trio with a host of rather unconvincing and poorly motivated secondary characters who mug, grin, and otherwise act goofy.

  The problems begin with the Handsome Rich Guy Fang Zhan-cheng (Kingone Wang). For the entire run of twenty episodes, Fang Zhan-cheng maintains an impassive face, speaking quietly, reassuringly, and logically. This mode of communication works well in isolation but begins to pall when he either cannot or will not try another. The Beautiful but Poor Girl Chen Yu-xi (Lorene Ren) has her own issues with locution. Chen Yu-xi whines nearly every line of dialogue to such an extent that she palls as well but for an entirely different reason. In a double role Lorene Ren also plays Liang Luo-Han the first fiance of Fang Zhan-cheng, the former dying in a car crash while the latter is blinded. Enter Chen Yu-xi who is the exact physical twin of Liang Luo-Han. It does not take significant cerebration to guess that the two are biological sisters. The first half of the series centers on Fang Zhan-cheng hiring Chen Yu-xi as his personal care assistant while the second half details the business contortions that first bind them then later separate them. A secondary problem is the effect that Fang Zhan-cheng has on all women. Chen Yu-xi falls in love with him.  The woman who receives the heart of Liang Luo-Han also falls in love with him.  The female business competitor of Fang Zhan-cheng does likewise. And then there is his own step-sister who cannot resist his manly charms. And through it all, Fang Zhan-cheng mysteriously floats above all this adulation.

  A third problem is how all these minor characters interact with each other and with Fang Zhan-cheng. Simply put, their words and deeds reek of a script writer vainly seeking to make them assume a mantle of believability. The best of them is the non- villainous villain Li Bo-yan (Sean Lee) who enters the series as a sort of Taiwanese J. R. Ewing from DALLAS but exits as a reformed sinner. Ultimately, SOMEONE LIKE YOU loses credibility and hence viewer interest as the ""you"" of the title remains lost in a mushy mess of little meaning.",1460332800,,2493,4.904988123515439
