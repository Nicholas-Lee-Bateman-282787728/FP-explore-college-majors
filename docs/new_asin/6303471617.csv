655206,5,6303471617,"Boy, it's good to see a film one really likes that is just about unknown.....and read other reviewers who share your high opinion of that movie or a certain character.

That's the case here in this simple revenge tale. My attraction to this film, outside of the interesting story, is the acting performance of William Devane, who plays the lead character. Seldom have I seen such a fascinating character and I see a few other people here at Amazon agree.

Devane's character, ""Major Charles Rane,"" had some interesting things to say BUT his silence was downright fascinating. Just the looks on his face and the absolute silence when his wife tells him she had been fooling around in his absence (when he had been suffering as POW, no less!) or when the robbers are giving him a horrible, sadistic beating. With the exception of one, maybe two outbursts, his language was surprisingly civil, too.

The movie had what I call ""that gritty '70s look"" to it but was well-filmed and probably would look very good on DVD. (We are still waiting for that to happen.) There were some solid closeup and shadow shots which added nicely to the neo-noir story. The violence is no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point and, with one exception at the end, realistically brutal........ but not overdone. The film starts slowly for the first 10-15 minutes but is a fast ride once the thieves enter the picture.

Co-star Linda Haynes reminded me of Tuesday Weld but not quite as pretty and a tiny bit harder looking. Nonetheless, she was an interesting new face and one I still don't recall ever seeing in any other film. It's also fun to see such a young Tommy Lee Jones.

Revenge movies can be a dime-a-dozen but this has at least one scene I guarantee you will never forget.",1145577600,9,1752,4.731147540983606
655207,3,6303471617,"This is a flawed but very interesting movie. What strikes me is that it starred Bill DeVane with Tommie Lee Jones in a supporting role. At the time, DeVane was headed, seemingly, for stardom. He had been brilliant as JFK in ""The Missiles of October"" and even better as a turncoat spy in ""Marathon Man"". Yet it was Jones, not DeVane, who went on to screen greatness.
DeVane is a Vietnam flyboy, shot down, captured by the Communists, held and tortured for seven years. He returns to his family, but is estranged from them. They are killed in a robbery. This is where the film veers somewhat, because it is in the realism of his character that DeVane leaves us wanting. The realism is that DeVane has learned, been programmed, to be dehumanized. It was the only way to survive his Vietnam ordeal. As he reacts to ""the world,"" or rather does not react to it, to his family, his wife who plans to leave him, he has no emotion left. It has all been drained from him. He speaks about ""when we were alive,"" which was the prisoner's code for before capture. He is like a zombie. It is good method acting, but the viewer thirsts for more.
The script tries to take us there by showing DeVane with a blonde ""groupie"" who tags along while he sojourns into Mexico and El Paso looking for his family's killers. Eventually he teams with Jones and they exact their revenge, which is as much their personal release of violent expression against their captor as it is the killing of the robbers who murdered DeVane's family.

655209,4,6303471617,"I first saw this video in 1985. The movie caught my attention and held it throughout. Sure, there are other movies that attempt to deal with the plight of the vet, robberies and vengeance, love of family and vendetta. But there is not a movie out there that combines all of  these with the same rhythm and intensity as ""Rolling Thunder."" At a time when movies are relying more on computer generated graphics than on a plot with substance, Rolling Thunder should be being aired on TNT, TBS, Lifetime, TNN and any other cable channel that wants to break away from the monotonous hum-drum of the fare being shown in the name of ""entertainment."" Devane does more than one good hand and a hook than most of today's action heroes do with both hands and both feet. Rah also for my main man, Tommy Lee Jones, who takes a back seat to Devane, but stands by his buddy to the end as they seek out the baddies that done Devane's family wrong.

I was blown away not only by the performances (particularly Tommy Lee Jones in a startlingly forceful role), but by the amazing amount of action.  There is definitely more violence and action than there is in ""Driver"" and that's why I like it.

But of its kind, ROLLING THUNDER is among the first and certainly the best. It's great to finally see it get some proper respect with this solid Blu-ray release. 5 STARS

THE STORY: Major Charles Rane is coming back from Vietnam after spending seven years in a POW camp. Emptied by the years of unrelenting mental & physical torture, he hopes to pick up the pieces of his fractured life: the wife he left behind & the son he never knew. However, his dreams begin to unravel on his first night back, and quickly splinter into a mind-shattering nightmare. When a spiritually & physically broken man has the last thing worth living for taken from him you can bet there's going be Hell to pay. Oh, yes. There's going to be Hell to pay.

THOUGHTS: From writer Paul Schrader, who gave us the brutally unrelenting TAXI DRIVER, comes this blood-drenched tale of betrayal, death, redemption and ultimate retribution. Bill Devane is riveting portraying damaged Vietnam veteran Charles Rane. In every scene he's in you can almost see the emptiness eating away at him from the inside like a cancer. There's a great shot of him sitting on the couch at home that first night back, talking with his wife. As she unloads on him you see his face side-lit in silhouette. The only hint of his eyes are two white points flickering from under the shadow of his brow, like tiny glowing embers. A young Tommy Lee Jones, in one of his earliest roles, plays a fellow POW returning along with Rane. His brief but powerful performance truly impresses; indicating from the beginning what talent he possessed. His character appears even more haunted and damaged than Devane's and Jones says as much with his face & body language as he does with his minimal dialogue. The movie's final confrontation is simple, savage and extremely real-feeling. There are no flashy camera moves, heroic music, witty one-liners or macho posturing. It seems to really be happening, coincidentally caught on-camera for us to stare at, like shameless rubberneckers at a horrible traffic accident. The film is as powerful, entertaining and epic as it is unflinching, stark and bestial. If cold revenge is a dish you enjoy, then dig in. It doesn't get much better than ROLLING THUNDER.

THE BLU-RAY: While not a frame-by-frame restoration, Shout! Factory's hi-def transfer for ROLLING THUNDER is quite strong. It isn't perfect but it's good. The film does have some scratches, dirt & debris, but there's minimal noise, pixelation and artifacting. The sound is a little on the soft side but it's even and clean. A handful of bonus goodies make this an even better value. A newly-shot retrospective piece on the making of the film is first, with separate on-camera interviews from stars William Devane & Tommy Lee Jones, writers Paul Schrader & Heywood Gould, and the film's stunt coordinator. The original theatrical trailer is also included, along with TV & radio spots, and a lobbycard & promo gallery.",1451520000,8,3088,4.855787476280835

655556,5,6303471617,"If you like revenge thrillers with more than a slight political slant, you'll probably do no better than this one, possibly the best film American International released in the 70's. Former POW Charles Rane (the excellent William Devane) returns home with the simple plan of putting the whole war behind him and get back to his wife and son. Only the town will not let him forget his ordeal and give him a stash of 2000 silver dollars (one for each day of his captivity) at a parade given in his honor. To top it off his wife has fallen in love with another man (the local sheriff) and wants a divorce. A bunch of thieves (led by James Best and Luke Askew) break into Rane's house and demand to know where the silver dollars are kept. When Rane refuses to answer they put his hand down the garbage disposal (According to the IMDb: ""Famous scene where Rane's hand is put into garbage disposal was originally lot more graphic. There was originally shot of his hand getting destroyed. Scene was filmed with fake hand and lamb shank which made it look very realistic. When movie was previewed, audience members reacted very strongly on that scene. According to writer Heywood Gould; 'One woman fainted, another person ran into the lobby and demanded it's money back, and another guy was so freaked out that he entered in his car on parking lot and crashed into another car'. After that preview, shot of Rane's hand inside disposal was cut out from the movie."").  Rane's son gives up the coins and Best and his gang shoot and kill Rane's wife and son and think they have also killed Rane. He wakes up in the hospital, has his destroyed hand replaced with a hook and plans to get even with everyone involved in the robbery. Together with a groupie (Linda Haynes), who wore his POW bracelet while he was in captivity and his angst-ridden POW buddy Johnny (an early role for Tommy Lee Jones), Rane goes down to Mexico to exact revenge. It's bloody, exciting and satisfying. Directed by John Flynn (OUT FOR JUSTICE - 1991) with a particularly grim outlook (prevalent at the time of filming), but I think most of the credit must be given to the literate screenplay by Paul Shrader (TAXI DRIVER - 1976; who wanted Rane to be a racist, but the studio rejected his idea; the Mexicans killed at the end were supposed to be substitutes for Rane killing the Vietnamese during the War.) and Heywood Gould (THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL - 1978), who would both go on to directing careers themselves. ROLLING THUNDER is a must for revenge fans that's not just brain candy but food for thought. Also starring Dabney Coleman, Cassie Yates and James Victor. An Orion Home Video VHS Release. This film gets my highest recommendation and is finally available on widescreen DVD-R from MGM On Demand and a beautiful print on Blu-Ray from Shout! Factory.

Tommy Lee Jones' performance is very cool. Luke Askew does his part well also.

The extras are nice to see, especially the interviews with Schrader and the principal players, but an audio commentary would have made this a knockout. The song ""San Antone"" is mentioned in the DVD commentary on ""The Ninth Configuration"", another classic film that they just don't make anymore--at all, sadly. In any case, the sound and color and very good, and the package (including the pulpy cover art) is astonishing. As for the film itself, I am truly impressed. I agree with Gene Siskel that this film was one of the best from the class of '77. If you are used to these hormone enraged junk movies of today (like the unmentionable ""Transporter"" series) then you may be too impatient to appreciate the impact of the climactic shootout, probably the best of its type ever filmed--it rivals ""Scarface"" (1983) (I would say surpasses it even) for intensity in a climactic shoot out sequence for its choreography (I was perspiring, so I know that the ending works). Great acting by Devane, and it's Paul Schrader of ""Taxi Driver"" notoriety, so why carp?

655757,3,6303471617,"Quentin Tarantino had named Rolling Thunder one of his all time favorite movies, even going as far as naming his old film distributing company 'Rolling Thunder Pictures'.  I'd love to watch this flick with Tarantino in his theater, but alas...I was forced to watch it via Netflix in my living room while my wife slept on the couch (not a fan of 70's cinema, by any stretch).

The first thing of note about this movie is that it was written (the first time) by Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull).  Originally, it was written as more of a commentary on the Vietnam War, having his main character as a racist redneck, plowing down innocent Mexicans by the films end.  This was heavily changed in a rewrite handled by Heywood Gould, who changed the ending, made changes to many of the films relationships, and toned down a bit of the relentless violence.  Of the changes, Schrader said that he ""wrote a film about fascism, and the studio made a fascist film"".

Here's the finished premise:

A Vietnam POW returns home, unable to adapt to everyday life.  When something tragic happens, he goes to get revenge.

The poster tagline is hilarious (and makes no sense): ""Emotion built in him like a gathering storm to explode like thunder!"" - Uh...

Devane (who you may know as Audrey Raines's father on 24) feels like a block of wood in this film...which may have been intended.  At no point does he show any emotion.  He feels more robotic than human, a condition surely attributed to his seven years in a Vietnam POW camp.  Haynes is decent as his groupie, and a young Jones is great in a small role as Devane's wartime friend, excited about getting back to 'business'.

The story is a slow burn and slogs a bit in the middle - certain decisions by the main character are very questionable.  I had a few problems with the story, and really hated the 'arc' (loosely put) of the character, Cliff.  His story really seems like it could have been left on the cutting room floor.  The ending is fantastic, a shoot out that feels very real in a Mexican whorehouse.

I can see why it was one of Tarantino's favorites, although it is not one of mine.  It has more in common with Sam Peckinpah than a traditional Schrader scribe - the violence, the minimalistic dialogue.  It's still worth a watch.  Also worth noting, Travis Bickle makes a cameo appearance in the original script.  That would have been a treat - Bickle giving a head nod to Rane.

655856,4,6303471617,"Paul Schrader had already made a name by this time with his ""Taxi Driver"" script. He'd teamed up with Martin Scorsese and Brian DePalma and was now going to try and repeat the magic with another up and coming director John Flynn. The results are mostly good.

Here's the scoop. Major Charles Rane (William Devane ) and Johnny Vohden (Tommy Lee Jones) return to Texas as heroes after being held, for seven years, as prisoners by the North Vietnamese. To show their appreciation, the town gives Devane a huge, red, Cadillac Elderado and over $2,000.00 in silver coins. Some d-bag hombres hear of it and invade Devane's home, steal the loot, force his hand into a garbage disposal and kill his wife and son. Now he recruits a local gal and sets out for revenge.

At the surface this is a revenge tale, but it digs deeper in showing the plight of the soldiers returning from Viet Nam and the difficulty they have re-entering society. The Devane character's wife had given up hope and hooked up with another local guy. He's surprisingly Okay with that. He also doesn't even know his son who was 18 months old when he was deployed overseas. He's lost the ability to communicate with people and though he could have told the bad guys where the loot was, the memories of torture at the hands of his enemies reared up and made him hold the line, which cost him a hand. This is the best stuff going in the script. When the revenge part kicks in it's pretty much him trying to track them down and do them in. Other than the attempts to connect with his female counterpart during the tracking, this is a rather uninteresting part of the movie. The tracking isn't very clever and it all culminates in a big shootout that could have been staged better. And correct me if I'm wrong, it can't be that easy to cross over, several times, between the U.S and Mexico with a trunk loaded with guns.

In other words, expect to see specks and spots on this movie like you are in an old reel to reel movie theatre.  I guess I have come to expect that if you are going to release a movie on Blu-Ray, a company will clean it all up and make this a pristine copy of the movie.  Not so, with this movie.  At the beginning, you will see all kinds of artifacts on the screen, but just like in an old movie theatre, within 5 to 10 mins. most of the artifacts are pretty unnoticeable.

There are a few scenes, deeper into the movie, where there are couple of scenes that when you look at sky and clouds you see this weird shimmering effect on one side of the screen where the colors are not stable at all.

I do not regret buying this movie on Blu-Ray at all and until something better comes along, if ever, this is the best copy ever but just understand that this is not a cleaned up version of the movie.  Its like The Scream Factory had an old reel to reel version of this movie and transferred it over to Blu-Ray as is!!

Better than nothing, I guess, and certainly way better than any DVD version that has ever been released.  This movie, which was released back in the late 70s is still a great movie and stands the test of time.

656023,3,6303471617,"""Taxi Driver"" was a great film as was ""Coming Home"".  No two films could be more different thematically yet work within their framework.  Ironically ""Rolling Thunder"" was co-scripted by Paul Schrader who also conceived the original story and made his name with the brilliant screenplay for ""Taxi Driver"".  For whatever reason this film does not ultimately work.  For the film's first third it is a moving depiction of the men who selflessly served our country during the Vietnamese conflict and their hardship in readjusting to civilian life.  Abruptly it turns into a revenge film after the family of the film's main character, a returning Air Force Major and P.O.W. played by William Devane, are viciously murdered by a group of thieving thugs.  Despite the pretext of the Major exacting bloody justice because his wife and son are killed this plays into the then popular stereotype among Hollywood elitists of the unhinged returning Vietnam vet which does a disservice to these valiant men.  Virtually wasted are superb performances by Devane, a young Tommy Lee Jones as one of the men under Devane's command and Linda Haynes as Devane's sympathetic girlfriend.

656108,5,6303471617,"looking back at this movie now is like going back in time for us who lived in the 70's.  Rolling Thunder is a bleak movie that was made in the mood of the time and looks even bleaker now.  Thunder is a no nonsense movie with no humor.  It has sadness, rage against things that are beyond human control, and no promises of a bighter future.  Devane never was an action type actor.  A very good actor but not one who looked like an action star.  However for those you who are new to the 70's movies or were not born then, that is the point the director was trying to make.  Devane was every GI who came back fron Nam to a ""hero's welcome.""  The people cheered for a minute then stopped and left you alone.  People didn't understand what the war did to person.  The movie shows in muted colors that no one comes home the same as they were as they left.  It is sad that this movie,in hind sight, shows how love ones stopped loving and ran from the returning GIs.  This is the saddest part of the movie, especially having know many who had this happen to them.  The hand in the sink scene has not lost any of its grumsome violent effect on the viewer.  You don't see it but you feel it.  If you can detach yourself from the movie, watch Devane's change back to warrior as he prepares to go to ""battle.""  It is cold and chilling but not flashy.  I can not say enough about Tommy Lee Jones in this small part in this movie.  He has the very same problem that Devane's character has and has felt what Devane has felt, yet his charcter is not a copy of Devane.  The viewer is treated to two actors working together as one to create a mood and to honestly gilve dignity to two characters that could have been protrayed as psychos.  That is the strongest part about this movie, the characters have honor, dignity, and are show in an honest light.  They are not pure nor are they flawless.  The viewer cares about them but doesn't want to be them. The action scene in the Mexico is was brutal when I first saw it back then, now is still seems realistic and brutal today.  There are very few low tech  special effects. The director does not want you to cheer for the two GIs, no this is not a glory moment nor a ""redemtion moment.""  This is just two men doing what they know because they don't know how to do anything else.  There is no happy ending, no getting the girl, no clearing away old ghost, chance of normal future, no nothing but livng the next day and not knowing what will happen next.",1298592000,19,2484,4.187763713080169
656109,4,6303471617,"I'd been hearing about this movie for years. I even had a vague recollection from my childhood of a scene where William Devane is having to practice with his left hand since... Well, anyway, not to spoil anything but everything I'd read about this movie turned out to be true and it was GREAT. This is no ""Born on the 4th of July,"" ""War is Hell"" diatribe. This is about badasses being badasses because they just don't know how to be anything else. Is it shallow and exploitative? Surprisingly, it's not shallow at all. I will call it ""lean,"" though, in the sense that good film noir (which is really what this is) is deliberately kept sparse in characters and in setting. Think ""China Town"". There isn't a lot of what I would call human drama, but what there is only serves to move the story along and really sink the hook that is William Devane's character arc from Hero to Anti-Hero. The movie is supposed to be stark, and brutal and show that violence, for some, is simply a way of life. It's the only way they know how to react. It is shocking, especially in that it's fairly realistic- surprisingly so, actually. I'm a shooting enthusiast (aka, a gun nut) and whoever made this movie obviously took the time to make sure Devane and Jones actually look like they know what they're doing in combat. Ditto the bad guys (maybe even more so; the villains in this film make other villains look like candy asses). I don't want to go too far into the the story as I'd give a lot a way. I will say that the plot is simplicity itself: Vietnam POW Hero comes home, finds he is alienated from the world, has a series of really awful things happen to him and reacts in the only way he knows how anymore: with unflinching, uncompromising violence and a moral code that is quite a bit simpler than the rest of the world. His knows his vengeance is righteous  so he literally will not hesitate to throw down. I can't recommend this movie enough to those who enjoy gritty film noir (think ""Point Blank""), and/or B-movies; especially WELL DONE B-movies.

656111,2,6303471617,"I was kind of disappointed because of the""well known"" actors and the story line.  I was unprepared for the brutality and bloodiness of the movie, not in Viet Nam but home, in Texas.

I personally feel that this movie had the potential for being more realistic, as far as being a prisoner of war for eight years, and suffering from post traumatic stress.  First of all, I think the excellent (I realize he didn't have much experience yet, but was still quite talented) Tommy Lee Jones deserved a much larger part, as he was extremely good in the scenes he played.  You could feel his rage, loneliness, suffering, isolation and inability to associate to his old surroundings.  Of course, his family seemed totally unaware of his suffering or what he had endured.

The beginning was absolutely brutal, and his wife telling  William Devane, she was leaving him on the day of his homecoming was cruel and inhuman.  I'm not a screenwriter, of course, but the movie just didn't have the ""right"" feeling.  It had the potential of being more moving,heartbreaking, and  realistic, if it concentrated on what these two Viet Nam victims had to go through coming home.  The way they had been violated and were still being violated by the U.S. government (forgotten all about), misunderstood by their family, getting councelling or some way to help them endure their particular torture of being a prisoner or simply being a part of the war and all their anguish.

The brutal beginning about his son, the money, losing his hand and the horror didn't seem to be as horrific as their psychological trauma.  Their are so many movies today, ""No country for Old Men"" which made sense in the context of the story for all the cruelty,  disregrard for human life, violence and gore.

It should have shown rehabilitation for the two victims and possibly  able to go on to some sort of sembelence of a life.  In any well known, Viet Nam movie ie ""The Deer Hunter"" you are always left scarred, at least to some degree.",1252886400,4,1992,4.694524495677234

Tommy Lee Jones and Willem DeVane did 2 movies together on screen. Rolling Thunder was the first. The second time you see them on film again is Clint Eastwood's movie ""space Cowboys.""

Did you know?. Clint Eastwood originally had Sean Connery in the script, but Sean kindly declined the role and Clint chose another actor played by Donald Sutherland.",1237420800,5,560,4.704081632653061
656113,4,6303471617,"In the 1970s, Hollywood came out with some ""vengeance"" movies. Another one that comes to mind is ""The Farmer,"" which I saw with a group of buddies at the (Air Force) base theater.

Anyway, while ""Rolling Thunder"" might be short on military protocol (sloppy salutes and ill-fitting uniforms), it's long on what you would expect from this genre.

The bad guys are bad: Dirty rotten scoundrels in need of a shave and full of greed. They hang out in seedy bars and whorehouses and wear filthy shirts and have bad teeth. You get the sense that exterminating them is the right thing to do.

William Devane and Tommy Lee Jones are the anti-heroes. Icy cold. resolute and only after the bad guys. They don't lay a finger on a good guy.

The film slows down in a couple of parts, as it tries to give some depth to William Devane's character, mainly through his experiences as a POW -- recalled in black and white. I think the same scene was used repeatedly, which probably kept production costs down.

It should be noted that Vietnam War veterans were portrayed three different ways in Hollywood: First as deranged soul-less baby-killing whack jobs, then as disturbed whack jobs and finally as troubled men deserving of compassion. William Devane and Tommy Lee Jones are in the middle category (Magnum, P.I., was in the third category).

656115,4,6303471617,"WARNING: Spoilers follow

Plot-wise, this is your basic revenge story. But under the surface it is so much more. The first section of the film, nearly the first half, dealing with the homecoming of Major Charles Rane, a Viet Nam POW, is genuinely sad. 90% of ""action"" films not only do not choose this kind of tack, but are unable to bring it off. Rane finds that his wife has started a new relationship with another man who has also become a kind of step father to his son. The film portrays his reaction to this with painful ambiguity. He is reserved, and behaves well, but we sense a rage boiling just under the surface. Then later, he is robbed by a vicious gang and his wife and son killed. He takes up with a young ""veteran groupie"" who is infatuated with him and sets out on the road to find the killers. The girl tries to dissuade him from his mission and be happy with her. But he is clearly pushed into a state where human relationships are a thing of the past and he eventually cuts her loose. To those who say this is a ""simple revenge story"" I would ask, what would have happened if the robbery never occurred? he was already portrayed as emotionally fractured, and his life was already going down the drain. In a weird way the murders gave him his wish to return to a simpler, more violent way of being in the world. All the complications of the first half are erased. Later he ""rescues"" his friend played by Tommy Lee Jones from his own seething existence in an intolerably boring home life and the men engage in a gleefull bloodbath, ambushing and blowing away mostly unarmed, naked men in a whore house.

In my opinion this is a film about men, male bonding, the male violent impulse. Note that Rane tells Jones ""I found the men who killed my son."" Why doesn't he mention his wife who was also killed? When the two men leave in their uniforms, Jones' wife says ""you never put on your uniform for me."" Time and again the women in the film are portrayed as ousiders who don't get it.  After what the men have been through, women are useless to them. Jones then says goodbye to his father but not his mother, wife or anyone else at the table. The connection with sex and violence is always present. The romantic scenes with Rane and his young girlfriend are given plenty of time to linger, and it's no accident that the final shootout occurs in a whore house amid fleeing nude women.

 In my opinion the film is in the same league as Peckinpah's, it is portraying violence as something enduring, even when you take the circumstances, the robbery, even the Viet Nam war, away. It's a deeper statement about what men are, and, though it has B-movie elements, a work of art.",1171584000,4,2685,4.394366197183099
656116,4,6303471617,"I've loved this film since first seeing it in 1977 when its ultraviolent ending made viewers and critics cringe with shock and horror. Violence plays a significant thematic and on-screen role in this flick about war, horror, remembrance and revenge.

Briefly submitted, William Devane and young Tommy Lee Jones (before he hit stardom) are returning Vietnam war prisoners of war. Devane, an officer in the Air Corps, had spent time in the famous Hanoi Hilton prison and has occasional flashbacks of his torture.

Returning war hero Devane -- whose wife took up with another guy during his lengthy absnece, adding real life drama and a soap operatic agenda to the movie -- receives a generous local gift during ceremonies in his Texas hometown. Later on, a bunch of good old boys come to rob him of the gift. They torture him and off his family in the process.

The remaining 70 or so minutes of the film detail Devane's search for the killers and his revenge. He takes up with a lonely woman during the search while teaching himself to use a shotgun with his new mechanical hand (he lost the real one in the torture-robbery-murder back home.)

When he finds the killers, he looks up Jones, who is about to have dinner at home with his wife, dad and some other family members. What comes next is one of the greatest lines in all of macho male cinema:

""I've located the men that killed my family,"" Devane says. ""They're in a whorehouse down in (Mexico).""

""I'll just get my gear,"" Jones retorts.

There's not much left to the flick after that except a few minutes of outright mayhem that was probably among the best of its type in 1977. I recall another Vietnam-murder-revenge film of the era, ""The Exterminator"", which did this one better; but not many movies provided the kind of high class mayhem that goes on at the end of this movie.

""Rolling Thunder"" was, of course, the military code name for the U.S. bombing program that helped kill up to 3 million Vietnamese during our undeclared war with that nation circa 1962-75. The signature has both metaphoric and visual meaning for this movie, which is about a raid of another type that results in a lot of casualties.

Anyone that likes either of the main actors, high class violence, or revenge films will enjoy this movie, that is apparently not available on DVD. I've seen it recently on digital cable so I assume it will make an appeareance on DVD soon if it's not there already.",1171584000,57,2435,4.644186046511628
656117,5,6303471617,"I saw this movie over 15 years ago and certain images from it are still burnt into my mind. I was reminded of it recently when reading an article about Quentin Tarantino, which mentioned how he hosts screenings of his favourite movies at his home for close friends. Many of these films are out of print and very rare. Guess which one was among them? That's right, buddy. Which tells you something about the quality of this little-known gem. Starring the hugely under-rated William Devane, Rolling Thunder is an awesome revenge flick that will satisfy anyone with a fascination for sadistic violence. That being said, it ain't no gore-fest, rather the violence is portrayed from a psychological point of view, and the film is remarkably restrained, as is Devane's performance (Al Pacino, take note). I just have one question. WHY IS THIS FILM NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD? Someone needs to give it the treatment it deserves. Maybe Mr Tarantino will eventually champion its cause. For those of you who still have video recorders, this is the perfect way to kick back on Saturday night with a couple of cold ones and a big bowl of popcorn.",1161648000,2,1128,4.760204081632653

7847890,4,6303471617,"Rolling Thunder is an underrated film on so many levels.  This 70s revenge film, while derided by many critics for its extreme violence and imperfections (which it does have, including in some loose ends that aren't tied up at the end), is engaging from beginning to end, and includes some excellent acting from William Devane and Tommy Lee Jones as the returning POW vets.  Perhaps most importantly of all, Rolling Thunder is the first major (and possibly first minor/underground) film release that I've seen that reveals the post-traumatic stress afflicting veterans of the Vietnam mess and of war in general.  This film was released before The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now, and frankly, it goes into more character depth relative to how war permanently damages one inside and out than those two films (both Devane and Jones are distant with everyone except with each other, and Devane, responds with indifference to his wife having left him for someone else).",1469059200,,964,5.050314465408805
