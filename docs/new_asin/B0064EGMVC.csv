The best.
Buckley and Thatcher were brilliant.
No one has stepped up to replace either of them.",1392681600,6,126,4.521739130434782
4949282,4,B0064EGMVC,"This is a very interesting, thought provoking one hour session with Thatcher before she ran for Prime Minister.  The topic is timely and timeless for today's analysis of the failures of socialism, which is where many politicians don't mind taking America.  I found myself taking notes as rapidly as the two of them talked.  I don't have my notes in front of me, or I would share them.  I have already loaned my DVD and notes to a friend for his viewing.  Serious topic, excellent hour, well spent.  If I think of it, or can figure out how to get back to this review after I get my notes, I will share more details.  Worth every dollar to educate oneself in this vital matter.  Freedom or socialism, but you don't get both.",1378425600,3,722,4.416666666666667
4949283,5,B0064EGMVC,"The Iron Lady offers her views on the state of political affairs in Great Britain in the late 1970s, and the parallels with the United States at this moment in history are remarkable. Far-left socialism was ascending, and the political parties in power offered no credible opposition to the onslaught of statism. Thatcher clearly understood the ideological battle between the free society and the totalitarian state, and knew who (and how many) her sworn enemies were in Britain. In retrospect, of course, we can see that she was too sanguine about how the trade unions would react to her bold initiatives. Nevertheless, would that we had politicians who could so clearly expound on the principles of classical liberalism and lead with her unflappable courage of conviction today.",1376784000,,780,5.149606299212598
4949284,5,B0064EGMVC,He is a great interviewer and she was a sensation as an MP.  The highlights were probably when she would put him in line and talk over him.  I could have watched those two for hours.,1376006400,,182,4.027777777777778

4949286,5,B0064EGMVC,"I was too young to know or understand the significance of Thatcherism, Reaganism, and Jean Paul II's post-WWII, Cold War papacy.  I enjoyed watching Lady Thatcher's robust presence on ""Firing Line.""",1367020800,4,198,5.387096774193548
4949287,5,B0064EGMVC,"A great episode highlighting the iron lady.  If you were too young to have been around during her reign as PM and all you know is the biased accounts of later days then this will be an eye opener.  She comes across as smart, articulate and a great leader.  I would advise others to watch it in order to see a great leader.",1353542400,8,322,4.079365079365079
4949288,5,B0064EGMVC,"One of the best parts of this episode is seeing Thatcher in all of her glory before she came to power in Britain.  Female politicians are inevitably compared to the ""Iron Lady,"" but watching things like this shows just how few politicians of any gender are worthy of even being in a discussion of comparisons with her.  She had a keen intellect, a disciplined mind, and a force of character that is exceedingly rare.",1333843200,12,416,4.608108108108108
8492497,5,B0064EGMVC,Thatcher and Buckley...what a combo.  It is a luxury to watch these great figures of history appear on these programs from the perspective of several decades later.,1459296000,,164,5.074074074074074
8492498,5,B0064EGMVC,Magisterial discussion; you will not hear this sort of give and take on TV today.,1459209600,,81,4.466666666666667

8492500,5,B0064EGMVC,A fabulous interview and well worth watching. It is still relevant today. The discussion of the day's topics then can be applied to today's issues. Cannot recommend it highly enough.,1453334400,,182,5.1
8492501,5,B0064EGMVC,The one and only Bill Buckley,1440979200,,29,4.0
8492502,5,B0064EGMVC,"Have viewed a number of his interviews and loved this with my favorite being with Truman Capote debating capital punishment.  Frankly I used to pass up  Firing Line because I thought this Buckley guy was pompous and self important, I neglected to watch him and discover his brilliance.  A tip to the readers - view the film Capote and the next evening watch Buckley/Capote debate. Phillip Seymour Hoffman should have won a minimum of two best actor awards for his portrayal of Mr. Capote.",1419552000,,488,4.785714285714286

8492506,5,B0064EGMVC,"For this episode of ""Firing Line,"" host William F. Buckley went to London to interview Margaret Thatcher, then the leader of the Conservative Party in Britain, about the failure of socialism in that country.  The episode aired in July 1977, when the U.K. was in the grip of the stagnation and inflation brought about by Labour Party policies--Britain would vote for change less than two years later, electing Thatcher as the country's first woman prime minister.

In the course of the discussion, Thatcher asserted the link between economic freedom and political freedom and stressed the importance of the free exchange of ideas.  She illustrated how socialism robs people of their basic human dignity and got off a great line on how high taxes perform as a disincentive, leading to depressed revenues and stagnation.

Some of Thatcher's observations about the Left and its politicians remain as true in 2014 as they were in the Seventies, and present-day American viewers will recognize the parallels to our own situation in the last few years.  Thatcher opined about her country that ""we're a lot better than our present performance,"" and of course got to prove that assertion as prime minister.  Conservatives today would enjoy this look back at this intelligent conversation between two giants of Anglosphere conservatism.",1399075200,2,1326,5.2018779342723
