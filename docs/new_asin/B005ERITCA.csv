4667188,5,B005ERITCA,It should be a cult classic.  An engrossing mix of  psychological &  obliquely romantic drama played out in the backstop of  Irish barren beauty.,1359331200,,145,4.916666666666667
4667189,5,B005ERITCA,This is one movie I will not loan out. I will find out who else likes this and it will become a gift.,1357776000,,101,3.4347826086956523
4667190,5,B005ERITCA,"The writer, director and the protagonist are all women and I bought the movie in an attempt to understand the motivations here.  Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of woman?",1354579200,,177,4.53125
4667191,5,B005ERITCA,"Excellent film -- well acted and beautiful scenery.  So sit back, pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine and escape into this beautiful piece of work.",1342742400,4,157,4.233333333333333
4667192,5,B005ERITCA,"NOTHING PERSONAL is one of those films you take a chance on.  Stephen Rea (Martin) has never been a favorite of mine and I had never heard of Lotte Verbeek (Anne).  The writer/director, Urszula Antoniak, was also unknown to me.  Still, I took the chance.  With a very small cast and complex but contained story, this film delivers far more than most of its opulent counterparts.  A terrific but understated setup pays off in a wonderful, logical, but unexpected way.  No big production values but beautifully staged and shot.  Most notable is the dialogue, sparse and never ""on the nose"" but it reveals the story in an unconventional and engaging way.  The director allows the actors to act and has encouraged terrific performances which tell her story well.  I first rented NOTHING PERSONAL then bought it as a treasure.  It's one I don't loan out but look forward to sharing with those who enjoy real movies.",1332892800,12,910,4.7756410256410255
4667193,4,B005ERITCA,"First, the IMDB review offers a view that may be helpful to look at before watching the movie if you're the type who's not into abstract interpretative paintings. Thus said, the movie starts out with a young woman giving away all of the household and personal stuff in a garage style giveaway and then sadly taking off her wedding ring. Did she kill her husband; did he just die; did he leave? Who knows. Next she leaves her home in Amsterdam to hitchhike through Ireland. The movie shows the beauty of the country in counterpoint to her anger, sadness and loneliness as she walks, hitchhikes and camps as a solitary figure in that vast landscape. Midway through she finds an isolated widower farmer who tries to, in a patiently intelligent manner, bring her back to life. I say no more except in the end does she end up as she started?",1319760000,11,836,4.543046357615894
8468928,5,B005ERITCA,Nothing Personal is a beautiful love story. Stephen Rae is awesome in this movie.,1522972800,,81,4.857142857142857
8468929,5,B005ERITCA,"I loved this film and have watched it several times. Despite the nudity on the DVD cover, this is not a sexy story. I will admit, though, that I found the ending a little perplexing. I wouldn't know how to explain it to someone who hasn't seen it. In fact, I haven't been able to explain it to myself.",1518307200,,301,4.11864406779661
8468930,3,B005ERITCA,"The three stars are for the scenery.  The rest is loco.  The film just goes nowhere, the characters have no chemistry.  Actually they don't want any chemistry for each other.  They don't want to know anything about each other.  They just exist, maybe to heal, maybe because they're just quirky, I don't  know, all I know is that they betray each other over and over to a final supremo betrayal.",1500336000,,394,4.557142857142857
8468931,5,B005ERITCA,Great film!,1478649600,,11,5.0
8468932,3,B005ERITCA,This was an interesting movie to watch once but would find it boring to watch again unfortunately.,1473638400,,98,4.823529411764706
8468933,5,B005ERITCA,"This picture was a fantastic discovery, as I'd been completely unaware of it until I was ordering all of S.Rea's movies to watch. He is wonderful in it, as is the female lead. It is a very unusual, fairly heavy, love story. I watched it 3 times in a row it was so good: the photography, the story line, the acting by both leads. I rented it from Netflix to watch, then bought it as a gift to share with friends when I found it to be such a treasure!",1444867200,,449,4.0
8468934,5,B005ERITCA,"I have previously only rented this film, but it is the highest on my list for future purchase. This film is one of my favorites, out of many which portray the deeper intimacies and losses, about and within the human experience.

Yes, the ending, the last ""whatever minutes,"" where the challenge of loss begins for anyone in particular, will vary wildly, implicit in my further comments.

Loss is a fundamental experience which humans evolved with some abilities to learn from, especially within (rather than simply internalizing conventionally recognized and accepted behaviors--norms), and to begin to understand and manage. However, loss can be virtually ubiquitous on some levels, but, like all deeper human experiences, is potentially an endless and bottomless, infinite experience, requiring discipline and commitment in order to effectively support one's well-being and potential further development, rebirth and growth. It is the ultimate suggestion or requirement of the need for acceptance of powerlessness, and yet also of determination to continue embarking on development and the deeper journey, the most human needs for connection, and of the particular kinds relevant to the individual's place in development, and future needs .

A most powerful and demanding experience of loss, which the film begins with, and continues to maintain with the protagonist's behavior, concludes (what the ending was about) with our woman, having risked again, preparing in a new and more directed way (for her, apparently learning) for the ""future""....a bit vague, but I don't want to spoil the potential of creative interpretations.

This film addresses many of the most relevant and necessary experiences for personal, relational development, but only when the ubiquitous and potentially growth endowing experiences can be recognized for the value which they offer.",1441324800,,1863,5.549295774647887
8468935,5,B005ERITCA,GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!,1404345600,,19,9.0
8468936,5,B005ERITCA,"This film is a fine, believable story. The actors are terrific. It is touching, moving, funny, and has amziong subtle moments of love and challenge. It is a story of an unusual relationship of 2 people who learn to truly love each ther in their own way. It is a visually stunning film, as well.",1372032000,,294,4.363636363636363
8468937,5,B005ERITCA,"that shows no matter how disconnected people can get from the human race, there is always a way back.  Usually I find it tedious when two main characters have to meet for the first time and slowly establish some sort of bond but this one feels real.  There are hundreds of backpackers throughout Great Britain during the summer months and you wonder how many of them are simply damaged rather than drug addicts.",1365552000,,411,4.616438356164384
