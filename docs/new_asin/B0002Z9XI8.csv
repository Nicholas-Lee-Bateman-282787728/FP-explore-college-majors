8650635,3,B0002Z9XI8,This dvd did not play on my player I had to play it on my P.C. I was warned about this but other region 2 dvd's work fine. This has only happened a couple of times so it's not too much of a problem. My biggest problem & more serious is the price of delivery it is possible that the delivery could be more than the products that I buy & the time it takes for delivery appears to be excessive.(My things do arrive within the time specified).I'm happy with the bulk of my products & Amazon.com & look forward to more online shopping with Amazon...Thank you.,1519257600,,554,4.186915887850467
