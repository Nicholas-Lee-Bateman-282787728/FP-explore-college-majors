(but all of his films are great in my opinion. haha not perfect, but I personally still really enjoy them)  I recommend anyone unfamiliar with his work that's interested in watching this movie make sure that you watch his movie Rubber first, as I think that's a good test to know whether you're into his style or not.

It's a weird yet subdued comedy, and ends are not tied up, so if you're looking for over the top and everything becoming clear in the end, I would not recommend. haha But if you enjoy things being weird ""for no reason"" surrounding a bunch of subtle yet very funny moments, then you may enjoy this film.",1504051200,,797,4.342281879194631
8489677,3,B0052WNHFG,"I like strange movies, but this was ultimately kind of boring and not very funny. I didn't feel the fun sort of confusion I think the filmmaker wanted me to feel; I wasn't interested enough to try to follow along or make sense of things. It wasn't bad, though. One hilarious scene with Eric Wareheim (whose comedic sensibility I found underused).

Also, a good portion of this film is in French with subtitles. Didn't bother me, but I don't see that fact advertised anywhere on Amazon.

My feelings about Reality can be summed up thusly: Had I known this was on Netflix (at the time of this review) I would've watched it there and then not purchased it. However, I don't mind having my own copy. I might give it another try.",1483747200,,724,4.4772727272727275

8489681,5,B0052WNHFG,"I have been a big fan of Eric Roberts for some time now, I had the chance to see the movie on it's opening night at Downtown Boca Film Festival, and I loved it!!! lots of babes, different countries, and Eric Roberts is killing it! So I will definitely be one of the first to buy the DVD when it's out!",1306886400,3,301,3.9508196721311477
