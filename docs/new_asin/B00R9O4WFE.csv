6925244,3,B00R9O4WFE,"This is a story of 3 friends, two guys and one pop star female reconnecting after 6 years of not seeing each other. I guess they've never heard of Facebook. It's a pretty depressing sad movie that drives in a school zone most of the time. Slow as hell.

One repressed dude is married but is still masturbating to the female lead who was his high school sweetheart or obsession whom he never conquered and still longs for. The other dude longs to be in his high school three piece band with his 2 reunion pals. They try to interweave this parallel universe but the plot pretty much blows Leonardo DiCaprio. They try to get all serious and dramatic in the 3rd act but it just ends up being corny for my palette. It definitely improves as it goes but not enough to save the picture.

The acting is rock solid, great setting and music and it's all professionally done but it's just so boooooooorrrrrrinnngggg. 3 Nights in the Desert is a snooze fest and Movies & Candy says don't bother watching. I watched it so you don't have to.",1442793600,2,1027,4.4

6925246,2,B00R9O4WFE,"Great Concept, went no where. It feels like someone chopped too much script out of the movie- you get hints, but not enough to keep you interested. The main character behaved like a schizophrenic freak- as his  grudges were festering for his friends who moved on, grew up , and had lives- when he chose to stay  in the mindset of when they were younger.  Ho-hum.",1442016000,,362,4.454545454545454

6925248,5,B00R9O4WFE,"I just love these, out in the desert,  movies;  where nature rules, and humans are helpless.  Even cell phones, don't work, out in the desert.
Only the truth, rules.

One of my favorites was Scenic Route.  I wonder if that one is on Prime?  If not, it is worth paying for.

Anyway this one is well worth the watch.  I don't want to give anything away.  The desert is scary, and you never know what will happen there.",1435536000,2,416,4.230769230769231
6925249,1,B00R9O4WFE,Snooze worthy. I like character-driven books and movies but this was a painfully slow story about 3 friends with unresolved arguments and attractions.  Should've turned it off after the first 20 minutes but I thought it might come back to something interesting in that cave.  It did in the very last scene except that it was a dark and hazy shot of something I couldn't decipher. So unless someone has an explanation of what the cave was about it was just 90 disappointing minutes.,1434931200,5,481,4.714285714285714
6925250,4,B00R9O4WFE,"Well nothing and maybe something?  Great drama with musical flair about mid adults reflecting on their former youth about choices we all made or thought about in someway or the other.  Back to the cave, if only it were so easy to find out what you need?",1430352000,,253,4.361702127659575
6925251,3,B00R9O4WFE,"Three adults agree to get together on their thirtieth birthday (all born the same week). They were part of a band back in college. Anna (Amber Tamblyn) is currently a singer who is big in Asia and Europe. Barry (Vincent Piazza) has become a success tax attorney. He is ""pathologically honest"" and removes all his clothes and neatly folds them while sitting on the throne. Travis (Wes Bentley) who has the scars and limp from some sort of accident later explained, hasn't moved on and dreams of cutting an album.

During the stay old wounds are opened and some bonds and made and broken and remade. It was a story of little action and much drama about finding yourself, whatever that is.  Indie style entertainment. Heavy drama. Folk music soundtrack.

Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.",1428710400,2,782,4.777777777777778
6925252,5,B00R9O4WFE,"Great acting, great cinematography, great screenplay, and characters with depth and complexity that I grew to care about as the movie unfolded -- all this is what this movie had. This movie beautifully reminded me to cherish and experience fully what's happening right now, because when it goes, it's gone. And when it's gone, it is more profitable to move forward and grow than to stay stuck with regret and longing.",1428192000,8,417,4.887323943661972
6925253,5,B00R9O4WFE,"If ever there was an excellent example of ""you can't go home, again,"" it's ""3 Nights in the Desert,"" when three former band members decide to meet to celebrate their 30th birthdays (all in the same week - how did THAT happen?) and quickly discover that good and bad memories are all still with them.

The Hunger Game's Wes Bentley is fabulous as the, ""Hey, man, we can DO this!"" guy who wants to roll through life, without ever really being a PART of it. Vincent Piazza is the successful businessman who discovers that maybe he really HASN'T done what he wanted to do, after all and Amber Tamblyn is the one with most of the talent who has continued to be moderately successful in the music business.

Well written and an enjoyable date flick!",1426550400,7,743,4.496296296296296

6925258,2,B00R9O4WFE,"I wanted to watch this mostly for the scenery but the title says, ""3 Nights"".  I should have known better.  The part of the show I watched took place primarily at night so---no scenery.  It was also a little ""too deep"" for my taste.",1453766400,,232,4.2272727272727275

6925260,4,B00R9O4WFE,"A quirky little piece of pseudo-fluff, three old pals, band-mates in college, two he's and a she....brings into question the age-old adage ""You can't go home again"" into the light for further examination.  Can you? That's the conundrum, it is a thought-provoking concept, and what happens if you actually cannot make that linear adjustment? You cannot go home again, unless you have lost the way in the moment. The price tag paid by two of the three always appears too steep. But is it? How do you judge your present based only on your past? The answers all turn up, eventually. Just not in the manner in which we, simple viewers, always expect. This film has been on my watch list for about 2 years,  I just couldn't get the desire to watch at one sitting. Started over, and glad I did. This film does more than share a fairly well-written story, I think it also opens up discussions for debate on purely human desires. Sacrifices paid.. Paths not followed. Directions forgotten. It offers some time to process these conditions, to evaluate where you are on a symbolic journey to find your deepest desire.  I thought the acting was most excellent, although in all honesty, none of the characters are particularly likable.  They're too young to be so vague and unfulfilled.  It looks as though they've given up on their searches from younger days, and are all moving slowly towards what they may see as their final chances for adventure and success. All driven by guilt for some serious history, the extent to which we only see them achieve towards the end. That bit is actually grudgingly done, to draw the net tightly over all the undercurrents.  and pull the story together.
I can't recall ever seeing any of these performers, but I recognize Ms Tamberlyn from teen flicks the kids watched.  But I don't think a power name and face would have made this film any better.  It wasn't the face recognition, it was the manner in which the actors brought forth their persona's nature. One at a time, history is explained.  Truth will out.
Which made this film perfect for a brief look. The deeper meaning of the story takes a while to soak in.

Kudos for limited and tastefully done light nudity. A couple of F bombs, but excusable, considering content and process. Not for under 16, and that only with consent (right....).  No car chases or bombs, gun fights or drunken orgies. All in all, a thought provoking film which will bear a second or more viewings.  I recommend.",1453075200,,2469,4.676674364896074

6925262,2,B00R9O4WFE,"A character study with characters I didn't care about. An often told story about old ex friends that once were close reuniting at a desert shack for a long weekend.

8694660,3,B00R9O4WFE,"I liked this movie. It follows the idea of The Big Chill, and there are others like that which I haven't seen, so it isn't original. It's about a group of former members of a band, who have the same birthday, reuniting at one of the members' desert dwelling for a triple thirtieth birthday celebration.  Nice desert location for most of the movie, some surprising reveals and tender moments. One of the characters, Barry (the band's drummer) turns out to be somewhat of a deviate, compelled to strip naked in order to defecate, as well as masturbate several times daily. I didn't much care for him, but the other characters, Anna (vocalist) and Travis (desert dwelling guitarist) are okay. It was good enough to spend an hour and a half on.",1461024000,,740,4.648854961832061
8694661,3,B00R9O4WFE,"They had a band, they were friends, they are all damaged, they are getting together for their birthdays (all in the same week) in the desert. They fight, they disagree, they go into a cave, they argue. What's the point? Here we have three very talented performers, Amber Tamblyn, Wes Bentley and Vincent Piazza. Thrown into this situation where they have to talk out the old problems which are all still there. So to say it was okay is about the best I can do, as a more modern ""Big chill"" it falls short. I am sorry but I didn't find the characters interesting enough to really care. Wes is the angry creative writing guy, Amber is the singing talent and Vincent is drums? I stuck it out til the end, so there is something. Recommend? I don't know....I love a good story and this was somewhere in the middle.",1459382400,,809,4.4
