First warning of bad is a film made in 2011 and DVD released in 2013.
Second warning of bad is a unknown production conglomerate. Must have been a dead spot in their schedule to find time to release this or maybe they were just freed from abduction by viewing audience.
Third warning are cover graphics that have little to do with the overall tone of the movie or are just way overstated just to sell the product.
Fourth warning of bad. No subtitles to compensate for poor enunciation, poor dialogue script, bad audio. Not that anything of importance was said for 90% of the movie.
Fifth warning and this is very rare except in the cheapest of cheap - no scene or chapter option in main menu.
Sixth warning are lots of holes in the storyline such as how likely is it that the bride (in wedding gown) was kidnapped earlier and no one knows about it (police don't exist in this fairy tale).
Final warning of bad is me choosing to ff through most of what is the following storyline: A man is suddenly brought into a van by three (I think) kidnappers one of whom has a jiggly camera; the second adds drama by every so often punching the victim in the stomach; the third (female) spends the rest of the movie calmly telling the victim he isn't whom he claims but someone who changed his name after killing a girl when he was eleven or so. They all end up in the proverbial ""abandoned warehouse"" for cheap crime scenes and where the every-five-minute punch and interrogation continues until the end of the movie. There are no prelude scenes to anything or postlude scenes other than the female removes her mask, shows her face and I ask myself, OK, that meant nothing!",1378857600,4,1696,4.509740259740259
