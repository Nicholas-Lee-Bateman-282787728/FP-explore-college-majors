6433290,5,B00KL3TS7M,"I've enjoyed many Swedish mystery and crime series so decided to give this one a try, and I'm sure glad I did!  This is ranked right up there at the top.  I like that there is a small core group of police officers who solve some of the worse crimes in Sweden.  The interaction among the different people is interesting and develops as the stories progress.  There are 5 DVD discs and each tells one story in two parts.  We not only see how cleverly each officer works to imprint his/her contribution towards solving the crime, but we also see how the characters' various personalities and personal lives are gradually revealed in each story so that we come to care for them all as a unit.  They are called the A-unit, and they certainly are an ""A"" in my grading system.  I highly recommend this series and can hardly wait for more to come.",1410307200,5,839,4.409090909090909
6433291,5,B00KL3TS7M,"I purchased a region 2 copy of this series over a year ago and was quite impressed by it.  It's one of around 10 Scandinavian crime series (all of which I've enjoyed) I've viewed in the last couple of years, and I would rank it in my top five Nordic noir series.

Arne Dahl is similar to shows like The Eagle:  A Crime Odyssey (Oren:  En Krimi Odysse) and Unit One (Rejseholdet) in that it focuses on a specially created, elite group of investigators (another similarity--all three groups are headed by women).  There are seven in the unit--all with distinct personalities--and each gets his/her opportunities to be featured during the course of 10 episodes. There are two episodes devoted to a case, so you end up with basically five, three-hour movies--sufficient time to go into depth with each criminal investigation.

Given the international scope of the group's cases, the unit does a fair amount of traveling outside of their native Sweden, including to the United States.  And since English has become the de facto international language, quite a bit of it is spoken by all of them as they try to solve each crime.

All seven members are likable in their own unique ways, the criminals they are chasing are suitably horrific characters, and the cases are complex and compelling.  The crimes are terrible in nature, but there are occasional dollops of humor to relieve the grimness of the cases being investigated.

Arne Dahl, btw, is the pen name of the author whose first five novels about this unit are the source material for this series.  A second season is already in the works.  If it turns out to be anything like the first season, fans of crime series should be in for a treat.",1408320000,16,1693,4.7016949152542376
6433292,5,B00KL3TS7M,"Wow!  What a great series!  This series is comprised of great acting, great writing, great stories and great cinematography.  I can't say enough about how impressed I am with this first season of Arne Dahl.  This series contains very real stories and intimate views of each character's lives.  Just when you think I got it figured out, there was always a twist.  I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in Scandinavian murder mystery series.",1408147200,10,453,4.973333333333334

6433296,4,B00KL3TS7M,"This was an excellent series.  The thing is one must enjoy the Scandinavian shows as they are very different.  This, The Eagle, and Borgen which is the alltime best",1422403200,,164,4.620689655172414
6433297,4,B00KL3TS7M,"Each of the 5 disks contain a two part episode, and each part is 90 minutes long. For binge watchers, this doesn't represent any problems, but for me I only watch one part of an episode on one day, and the next part another time. While the team at first seemed disjointed, I quickly warmed up to the characters. It doesn't make sense to compare this series to The Killing or The Bridge; if that's what you're looking for, don't purchase these. However, if you want very well acted police procedurals and a diverse team of experts, then give this series a try. These dramas are not fast-moving, and while they are suspenseful, they won't keep you on the edge of your seat. Rather than focusing on one really strong character as The Killing or The Bridge, you get to know a team that has been pulled together by Commander Jenny Hultin, an older female officer. It takes time for the team to gel, but they do, and the rewards are great if you stay with them through five, two-part stories.",1421366400,8,986,4.45303867403315
6433298,1,B00KL3TS7M,"Not worth the time or the money. An overdose of uninteresting personal life and a thin intrigue. Slow, often boring, Arne Dahl cannot compete with The Killings or The Bridge. Actors are not good nor bad, they are just ordinary. Disappointing",1418688000,,241,4.902439024390244
6433299,5,B00KL3TS7M,"First time I had seen this and I really enjoyed it. I like the different characters and how they relate to one another. The stories  were well written and they were well acted, nothing over the top but more like actual life, Everyone has their job and their own life and it shows how they become intertwined. Everything turns out with some not made for happy ever after endkings",1417392000,,378,4.478260869565218

8659655,5,B00KL3TS7M,It is nice when the acting and writing is good PLUS it is different from other series you have enjoyed.  I found the last DVD (they were all two-part series) to be the best which is nice to end on a high note.,1465257600,,209,3.86046511627907
8659656,2,B00KL3TS7M,"my review would be: mediocre food; generous portions.

Im a big fan or Scandinavian mystery/police-procedural films and series  I believe that Ive seen most that are available to audiences in the US  and I put Arne Dahl at the bottom of my list. The basis of this opinion is the stories, which I found to be nave and unbelievable (either the series creator had no real understanding of the subject matter or he assumed that the audience would not). Add to that, uninteresting forays into the personal lives of the team members (none of whom is particularly memorable), and you have a series that pales in comparison to Wallander, Beck, or any of a dozen other Scandinavian series. On the other hand, the episodes are long.",1456617600,2,722,4.714285714285714
8659657,5,B00KL3TS7M,"Jan Arnold is a Swedish author I came to know a couple of years sago. His novels are brash and filled with violence, but they have a sense of urgency and excitement about them. We discover new characters who are brought together to formulate an elite Swedish crime solving team, Team A. Not much funding, and the team has to prove themselves, but the best part is that the team is led by a woman. I have read three of the novels, and now we have a television series by BBC4.

The team investigates crimes that are new and very sensitive and special, and we see the darker side if Swedish crime. CID inspector, Jenny Hultin, played marvelously by Irene Lindh. The series concentrates on developing the myriad of characters, all with issues if their own. Hand picked by Hultin, they are new to each other. Paul Hjelm played by Shanti Ronay has had a recent judgement issue resulting in a possible suspension.  Gunnar Nyberg played by Magnus Samuelson, has long lost children. Malin Arvidsson plays Kerstin Holm, trying to find her way and someone to over, Claes Ljungmark lays Viggo Norlander, an older man out of the active life for a while, Martias Varela plays Jorge Chavez,a tough guy, and Niklas Akerfelt plays Anto Sodurstedt, a firmer lawyer for the mob, now trying to right his way. All of the characters are excellent, acting is superb, and the storylines are first rate. This is my favorite Swedish series.

Recommended. prisrob 10-25-15",1445731200,2,1445,4.726190476190476

8659659,5,B00KL3TS7M,"I'm on a total International Crime Thriller binge, at the moment, and I find that this is one of my favorites. Where something like Braquo is really a corrupt cop drama, like The Shield, and where Spirals (Engrenages) can be a comedy of errors, Arne Dahl is more about intelligent policing and working the case with a cast of quirky characters. Unlike rnen / The Eagle (which, at times, shows its age) the unit in question, A Gruppen (A Unit), feels more like a team. They are no supercops here, but humans, with human problems, who are good at their jobs (and perhaps good at nothing else).
I'm putting this up there with my Scandinavian series like Dicte and Annika Bengtzon, and more consistent than Wallander, for me.",1441756800,,721,4.640625
