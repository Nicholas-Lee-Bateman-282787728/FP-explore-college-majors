4134200,4,B003KXDI4O,"In one year from today, Greensboro, NC's Charlie Engle will be released from prison. Right before he was indicted, his film, ""Running America,"" had just been released. Much of the promotion tour for ""Running America"" was cancelled, due to Engle's arrest, but Charlie isn't really the star of ""Running America."" That title goes to grand master (over 50) Marshall Ulrich.

Ulrich is a long time endurance runner from Colorado that faces obvious internal conflict as he attempts the 50+ cross country speed record. His story truly picks up in ""Running America"" when Charlie's ends. Charlie gets injured early into the film and can't continue the 3000+ mile jaunt across the country. Where Charlie's charisma is demanding of the audience's attention, Ulrich's struggle is equally, if not more, enthralling. Ulrich's wife succumbed to cancer at 28, and as his daughter Elaine states, he's been running from that ever since. Seeing Ulrich carry on day after day, averaging ~58 miles per day for 52 days is enough to make most of us feel pretty soft! Ulrich has also written a book about his nationwide trek, entitled ""Running on Empty.""

The scenery in ""Running America"" isn't quite that in ""Running the Sahara."" The film's B-story is the restlessness with the government and the economy surrounding the 2008 election. While many ""locals"" along the nationwide journey are interviewed about their disillusionment with the state of the nation, the running story still leads the way. Those interviewed seem most bothered towards the beginning of the journey/film and seem more hopeful by the time Ulrich is finishing up and Barack Obama is winning the 2008 election. It's filmmaking. It just seems a little odd as there are really two stories going on that don't really weave together.

That being said, ""Running in America"" is indeed entertaining, especially for those that have not seen ""Running the Sahara,"" as there are many familiar scenes of blister popping and just watching grown men deal with the agonizing pain that comes with running an average of 2+ marathons per day! When Engle is on screen, he commands it. His passionate attitude and dealing with those with special needs is excellent. Hopefully he'll continue more of that when he's released a year from today. If you aren't already, follow Charlie's always entertaining twitter feed about life inside Beckley Prison and his introspective and also comedic blog, the aptly titled ""Running in Place.""",1313884800,,2456,5.1197007481296755
4134201,5,B003KXDI4O,"Running America is kind of a low-key documentary about two men who took it on themselves to run from San Francisco to New York. You'd think, ""what could they do with that - it's just running after all.""  But the filmmakers let the whole cross-country aspect take over and interviewed people in different states all across the marathon route. That kind of snuck up on me - I started watching a sports film, and ended up watching one about America - that was cool.",1295913600,4,462,4.5
4134202,4,B003KXDI4O,"Video was good overall, I didn't know what to expect for sure, but I enjoyed it. Maybe will help me to push on in a run when I feel like giving up. This guy is made of steel!",1292889600,,174,3.6052631578947367
4134203,5,B003KXDI4O,"We held a screening of Running America at the Alamo Drafthouse in Houston on 6/3/10. It was a great, great evening. Alamo Drafthouse was the perfect venue, and even outdid themselves by offering $2 craft beer drafts to Running America viewers. Koala Health and Wellness was a superb sponsor, introducing the movie and setting up their stand afterwards. NEHST's discount on DVD's was a hit - we sold 40, all autographed by Marshall Ulrich who, along with his wife Heather, flew in from Colorado for the screening.

We sold 166 tickets, which was more than Alamo's evening screenings of Shrek, Ironman and Sex in the City combined! The audience might have been 100% runners, and they loved the movie! Laughs and gasps at all the right spots, and a standing ovation at the end of the movie. The cinematography stands out in the movie and showed up beautifully on the big screen. The ending is totally moving and, of course, runners never tire of watching other runners, so watching Charlie and Marshall running through our beautiful country was captivating. I will say, less (much less) political commentary en route would have been OK with me.

The Q&A with Marshall and Heather afterwards was fantastic, tons of fascinating information passed along. Then, just like at a race, lots of the attendees hung around in the lobby for up to an hour afterwards taking it all in.",1282608000,5,1369,4.821276595744681
4134204,5,B003KXDI4O,"This movie definitely has twists and turns not expected when you first watch it. These runners planned this run before the political events were to unfold. As the movie plays on, the theme of how the country felt at this time becomes evident. There is no way to understand the people of this country than to cross this land on foot. Is this a tough run to accomplish? Assuredly. But there is more depth to this movie than the running, as if that is needed. This is an engaging movie.",1282521600,5,483,4.377777777777778
4134205,4,B003KXDI4O,I found the belnd of an unbelievable act of endurance set against the backdrop of a changing America very compelling.,1282176000,,117,4.9
4134206,5,B003KXDI4O,"The filming of this amazing run across America between two great athletes caught an interesting time in our country, and the parallels between the precarious state of the country and the state of the runners as they struggled to complete this task was fascinating.  If you are a runner or marathoner - or have one in your life -  you will love this movie!  ALSO -- If you enjoyed Running The Sahara - this is a great follow up film featuring marathoner Charlie Engle.",1281484800,,467,4.535714285714286
4134207,3,B003KXDI4O,"I understand this run took place during a difficult time in our history, but the constant negative newsclips and interviews really made this a chore to watch. While I found it fascinating that people can do such amazing feats of endurance, it was not inspiring.",1277856000,4,261,4.822222222222222

8399054,2,B003KXDI4O,This one stunk.  Two runners I adore but seems hyped too much around US popular culture.  I wanted a running movie.,1415923200,,115,4.428571428571429
8399055,4,B003KXDI4O,"Marshall Ullrich is an amazing athlete.  I related to this as a new ultra runner a few years younger.  I'm glad I read the book first and then saw the movie.  Only negative part was the political overtones that were a little too prevalent. I understood the times and how the story related,; just seemed a bit much.  Really enjoyed the DVD!",1380844800,,339,4.419354838709677
8399056,2,B003KXDI4O,"I bought this movie hoping as most runners do, a little motivation. Instead, I bought an advertisement for Vitamix and a commentary on politics in America. Had very little running footage, but lots of negative Americans. I stopped it a bunch of times and came back hoping it got better. Nope. Look, these guys are amazing runners, but the documentary is absolutely worthless to runners unless you want a Vitamix or state of the USA in 2008.",1370908800,6,440,4.7272727272727275
8399057,1,B003KXDI4O,"Yup, I loved running the Sahara, but this was terrible. This was mostly about real life government politics. I wanted to learn about the run and the metal and physical capacity it takes to trek across America, not about the economy. The extras are better, but they are also a commercial for some supplement. Not worth a dime.",1363996800,3,325,4.620689655172414
8399058,4,B003KXDI4O,I am a distance runner and I love watching this film. The determination that these two guys have to push through the pain is inspiring.,1359331200,,135,4.44
8399059,1,B003KXDI4O,"After watching Running the Sahara, I could only manage to watch about 10 minutes of this lackluster documentary.  Why?  Because one of the main characters is Charlie Engle, an arrogant a-hole.  I had no sense that I was watching an amazing feat, but rather a couple of old men trying to break a record to fuel their own egos.  It's the typical ultramarathon man dominates nature perspective.  Further, the feat they are proposing would not be possible without the extravagent crew teams and support staff feeding and babying them across America.  Boo, bad movie, bad story, bad all around.",1346284800,8,589,4.898989898989899
8399060,4,B003KXDI4O,"Running America, a documentary about Marshall Ulrich's record-breaking coast-to-coast run, presents a very different perspective from his book about the run, Running on Empty, visually capturing the trials and logistical challenges of the attempt.

As Ulrich discusses in the book, he started this attempt not as a solo effort but with Charlie Engle, another ultrarunner with a long and impressive running resume.  Charlie dropped after a couple weeks, but stayed with the crew, riding his bike, speaking at several stops and participating with the crew.  Ulrich pressed on, completing the run in 52 and a half days.

Since Charlie was a main impetus behind the film--he had earlier done a film about his run across the Sahara with 2 other runners, Running the Sahara--he remained a focus of the film, even though he wasn't running anymore.  In Ulrich's book, Ulrich talks about the tensions with Charlie and the crew; that's not portrayed in the movie.  It's probably best not to immortalize that on film. . . .

The movie does have a positive spin that doesn't really come through in the book.  Shot during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, the film spends a lot of time on a ""one America"" theme, interviewing onlookers and passers-by about being American.  This part didn't add much to the movie for me, and not only because I believe the result of the 2008 election was ultimately destructive for the U.S., but I would rather have focused on the physical demands and logistical details of Ulrich's run.

That criticism aside, Running America is a compelling story and a visual treat.  Runners will like it, and some non-runners might be inspired to get up and go.  We can't all run across the U.S., but we can all run farther than we think we can.",1343779200,,1763,4.84
