7844998,2,6303391982,"Dull and boring suspense tale that is strapped with clich. Mel Harris stars as a businesswoman who begins a new job and is introduced to the office secretary (Sheila Kelley) who not only desires Harris's new job, she desires her life. I have seen other movies from the small series of suspense films produced by Pierre David and was expecting much more than this lame, slow-moving feature that delivers nothing more than some fine performances. Everything is too depressing to make the film exciting, and when we think something thrilling is about to happen, we get nothing more than a change to the next scene. This film is a waste of time. Some people may fancy it, but I am one person who likes a fast-paced thriller, and not thrillers like this.",1071360000,3,749,4.681818181818182
