8155937,5,B000KEKI62,"This is fascinating collection of animated short films from the former USSR. Broadly describable as propaganda, the films span three periods. The first is from 1917 to 1941 representing attempts to mobilize people to build the new socialist society. The second period spans the war and its aftermath - and the films are aimed at boosting morale and encouraging people to fight the German invaders. The third period covers the post-War era until 1989 when the object was to convince Soviet citizens of the superiority of their system over that of the West - and of the threat they faced from USA and its allies.

The films are reproduced on four discs. The first titled ""American Imperialists"" tries to show the malevolence of the capitalist enemy. ""Mr Twister"" is a tale of an American industrialist who takes a vacation with his family in the USSR. He refuses to stay in the hotel he has booked because on arrival he realizes that there are non-White guests with who he must share the hotel. His Soviet hosts however in the end compel him to accept the company of the guests after a series of pranks and misadventures they engineer and subject the Americans to. The American bigots, in the end, are shown a better alternative in ""socialist humanism"". Highlighting racial prejudice of the enemy was a common theme of Soviet propaganda - in contrast to the supposed welcome offered by the USSR to all. Interestingly, these cartoons were for domestic consumption and not known outside the USSR - at least until after the end of the USSR. Perhaps for good reason. Viewers in Western countries may have been less convinced by the depictions of their own societies than people in the USSR without knowledge of the outside world, even though some aspects of the critique of capitalism are uncomfortably close to the bone - and resonate today against the backdrop of the economic crisis that set in after 2008.",1410739200,,1903,4.819571865443425
