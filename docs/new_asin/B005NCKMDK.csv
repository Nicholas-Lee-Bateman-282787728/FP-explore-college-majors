A culture of change improves everything.  Through this ten-minute video teaching, Dick Hardy explores twelve steps in producing a culture of improvement within the church.

One of the most important things we can do is to continue evaluating our ministries, to continue to improve.  We must improve because the mission of the church demands it.
