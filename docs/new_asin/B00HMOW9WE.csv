I do not see the appeal of these two obnoxious girls who by the way are horrible actresses. They were loud and screechy. Lots of squealing and screaming so wear your earplugs.

6184402,1,B00HMOW9WE,"This movie is HORRIBLE.  I didn't know two little girls could be so obnoxious and who lets their small children disappear into the day essentially unaccompanied. The whole thing is unrealistic and I don't mean in a fairytale sort of way - just irresponsible, horrible examples, of glorifying how wonderful it would be for small kids to be separated from their parents in foreign town. I don't think it is appropriate for children and as a parent felt the need to sit down with my seven year old and make sure she understood how bogus the entire film was. Btw - she thought the movie was bad too. After watching it once, she told me she wanted to donate it to Goodwill.",1423353600,,668,4.475409836065574

After previewing the movie I realized it is not appropriate for the conservative values they learn from their parents and from their schooling. Too bad such a cute movie was slanted in so contemporary teen-type music. I will not give them to any child, but will dispose of them and use more care before purchasing media for our 11 grandchildren.",1419206400,3,499,4.747126436781609

Turns out that all 3 children LOVED it (9 year old girl, 6 year old boy, 5 year old girl) so much that I ended up purchasing it.  They have watched it multiple times, enjoy acting out various scenes from it and have memorized all the songs along with various phrases from the show ""Phyllis Bundt . . . . like the cake""

Def get the version with the extra footage, we love the out takes at the end ""Oooh me bum""

I thought it would be a bit nauseating but it is a well done children's comedy, songs are catchy, the girls do a great job and the cast is solid. Very unexpectedly find myself highly recommending!",1414281600,,699,4.155555555555556

I have watched it twice and my 92 year old mother has also watched it, so I'm going to say you're never too old to watch a cute G-rated movie that probably was intended for a much younger generation.  You can tell by the way both young ladies present themselves that they were brought up in a well respected and loving home.  Their mommies and daddies should be very proud of them.

6184511,4,B00HMOW9WE,"The movie Sophia Grace & Rosies Royal Adventure reminds me of a Cinderella fairy tale.  There are two bratty sisters and a very innocent one named Abigail.  It is similar to the Cinderella story because Abigail has two girls looking out for her as if they are her fairy godmothers. This movie is definitely an exciting royal adventure.

The story begins when Sophia Grace and Rosie are sent on a special assignment to meet the princesses of Switzelvania to see which one will be crowned Queen.  However, they loose their guardian and become mistaken as the Kings great grand nieces.  They end up having to teach the Kings daughter, Princess Abigail, the ways of being a real princess.  In the process, they get thrown into a dungeon because the bratty princesses (Abigails sisters) don't want her to become Queen.  However, at least they have their secret weapon.  To find out what that is, you will have to watch the movie.  In the end, everyone gets what they deserve!

My favorite part is when the security guard tells the guardian, Phyllis Bunt (Amy Louise Wilson) that she can get out of jail if she reveals her true identity.  She gives a made up name of Dynasty Composition knowing no one believes her real identity anyway.  However, the security guard lies and won't let her out.  Phyllis then jumps the security guard, ties her up and duck tapes her mouth.  I didn't see that coming!  It is hysterical.

All the characters are great, especially Princess Cordilla (Emma Pierson) one of the princesses who makes fun of Abigail.  She has a funny voice and isn't very smart and plays the part well. The main idea of this movie is that if you believe in yourself, you can make anything happen.

I recommend this movie for kids ages 5 through 12.  Specifically, girls will enjoy this movie, as every girl wants to imagine herself as a princess at some point. Therefore, I rate this movie a four out of five dazzling stars!  Sophia Grace & Rosies Royal Adventure is available now on DVD.

6184518,5,B00HMOW9WE,"I thought they would never get around to making a movie with these two super-talented and charming princesses! If you've ever enjoyed Mary-Kate and Ashley movies, you'll love this! These girls have so much personality they practically fly off the screen!
In this movie, Sophia Grace and Rosie help a princess to overcome her insecurities, recognize her talents and realize her dreams; all the while contending with and overcoming the obstacles placed in her path by her two competing sisters. It keeps a light touch throughout, with a humorous subplot involving the girls' chaperon who, after many misadventures, realizes a dream of her own.
But as entertaining as it is, even the story seems superfluous as it only needs to exist to provide a canvas for Sophia Grace and Rosie to shine. And they do shine, bringing all the fun, humor and talent you've come to expect from these extraordinary ladies. The music is catchy and upbeat, the settings beautiful, and the movie keeps a nice pace from start to finish.
I sincerely hope this will be the first in a long line of movies for these girls; they've debuted with a great movie the whole family can enjoy! Try it, you'll enjoy it too!",1401148800,3,1184,4.780487804878049

Her favorite movie is Frozen, and she also likes some of the Monster High movies, Scooby Doo and the Wild Kratts tv show.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was a story/plot to this movie.  Some of the music was a bit too non-princess like (rap, etc.), but overall, it has a good message and teaches children it's okay to be themselves.  There are many pop culture references that some young ones won't catch (like my daughter), but it's still possible to enjoy the show without prior knowledge.

It's filled with humor on multiple levels, and the underlying message for children is very positive and empowering.

All of her tea parties and doll play involves princesses. When I saw Sophia Grace & Rosie's Royal Adventure; I knew it would interest her but I wasn't sure if it would hold her attention at four years old since it's not a cartoon.

Paige was hooked from her first viewing!  She has been watching it over and over and over and over again! I watched it with her and it's a really cute story filled with fun music and dancing that will have you singing and dancing right along.

After appearing on the Ellen DeGeneres show and growing in popularity on YouTube with their serious talents; now you can enjoy them in this DVD with your little princess.

The story is probably a little old and lost on Paige but the musicality of it all makes up for it and has her performing along with them. It's probably better suited for girls in the 8 and older range but if you have a girl who loves princesses, she will still enjoy the movie.

Very little girls who are into pink and all things princess will enjoy this movie as well. But for everyone else?
