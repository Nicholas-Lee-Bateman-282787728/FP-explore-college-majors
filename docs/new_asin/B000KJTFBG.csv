2691825,4,B000KJTFBG,"After a string of disappointing films, Dario Argento seems to have found his niche directing ""Masters of Horror"" episodes, ""Pelts"" being the best. It can easily be interpreted as an anti-fur film {SPOILERS!} for in the film fur is literally murder. Everyone involved in making an incredibly luxurious fur coat, from the trappers to the seamstresses and model, meets a supernatural death apprpriate to their part in the making of the fur (a trapper sets a trap and plunges his face into it in an especially gruesome moment). Some people have objected to a film that takes a stand on an issue; art is meant to make a statement, and ""Pelts"" does this while telling a good story.  It is the most ""moist"" of the series so far and not for the weak of stomach. BTW, I own a fur coat, and I enjoyed ""Pelts"" tremendously. A film does not have to agree with my personal views to earn my appreciation.  For jaw-dropping moments along with commentary, I highly recommend checking out ""Pelts.""",1174089600,2,980,4.658959537572255

2691829,5,B000KJTFBG,"Do you like the old HBO series TALES FROM THE CRYPT? If so, PELTS may just be tailor made for you. In this installment of the popular MASTERS OF HORROR series, director Dario Argento gives us PELTS, the story of a fur trader named Jake Feldman (Meat Loaf Aday, who really needs to drop that last name, IMO) who stumbles upon the furs of several enchanted raccoons, and decides to make the world's most beautiful coonskin coat with them, in order to seduce Shana, the lesbian stripper of his dreams(A role filled out very nicely by Ellen Ewusie). One small problem: The furs, being once attached to enchanted-forest-dwelling raccoons, curse whomever they come in contact with to die as the raccoons themselves did; bloody, hideous, painful deaths.

So in no short order, the trapper who originally trapped the animals and killed them, his son, and several sweatshop workers are dead in stupendously over the top fashion, from gutting themselves, to diving face first onto a bearclaw trap (A great moment of giallo that is sure to please the gorehounds out there) to actually sewing their face shut. The only question left is whether or not Feldman can resist the siren song of the furs long enough to dump them and surive the nightmare he's found himself in.

The plot IS, as other reviews have stated, flat out ridiculous, but in PELTS' defense, no more so than the average episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT used to be. In fact, if you threw in a Cryptkeeper intro and extro, this would be a slam bang episode of TFTC. The acting is solidly in the B-movie range, as you'd expect from a made for cable movie, and only Meat Loaf really stands out from the rest of the cast. The gore is plentiful enough to keep the gorehounds happy, there's plenty of bare breasts to keep T & A fans happy, and over all, horror fans in general should find enough in PELTS to suit their fancy. A great entry into the MASTERS cannon, right alongside Argento's other entry, JENIFER. Recommended.",1172361600,9,1971,4.644699140401146
2691830,4,B000KJTFBG,"In this latest installment of the acclaimed masters of horror series - Dario Argento's follow up to ""jenifer"" is a movie that does not pull any punches with gore and sexuality at all.  The story goes (simply enough) - enchanted racoons are caught and skinned - but not without exacting some gory revenge on those responsible for their capture.  Meat Loaf is great as Jake Feldman - a furrier whose lust for a dancer drives his bloodlust to finish the coat over everything and anything else that stands in his path.  Overall - This movie, while I thought was a little rediculous (killer raccoon pelts?).. totally delivers.  The gore is there, the settings and 'costumes' are great and the acting is well done.  Trust me... you'll never look at a fur coat (or a damn raccoon) again the same way!",1171324800,3,793,4.635714285714286
2691831,5,B000KJTFBG,"PELTS is a nasty little tale of obsession, murder, self-mutilation, and retribution. A low-end furrier named Jake (Meatloaf Aday from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, WISHCRAFT) gets the chance of a lifetime when he acquires several pristine raccoon pelts. Unfortunately, these were no run-of-the-mill raccoons! These were mystical creatures that have already cursed and avenged themselves against the trapper (John Saxon from BLACK CHRISTMAS, CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST., etc.) who killed them. Jake sees the pelts as the key to the heart of the stripper (this gal seems to never wear clothes!) he's obsessed with. He makes a beautiful coat for her, ignoring the carnage that has already surrounded the furs. PELTS is one of the better MASTERS OF HORROR offerings, dripping w/ menace and gooshy splatter. The story is well-done, the characters are solid, and the payoff is huge! Own this one...",1264636800,2,909,5.232876712328767
2691832,4,B000KJTFBG,"A slimy furrier, Jake, (Meatloaf) gets his greedy hands on some prized raccoon pelts and uses them to make an exquisite fur coat for the object of his desire- a sultry stripper named Shanna (Ellen Ewusie) who has no interest in being with him unless he has something to offer her. What Jake doesn't know is the raccoons used to make the coat were sacred animals, ""sentinels to the lost city"", who were hunted by a shady fur trader (John Saxon) and his son on forbidden, sacred land so their furs are cursed. Anyone who seeks to exploit their hypnotically beautiful pelts end up becoming victims of their spirits wrath and self mutilation and an agonizing death is the end result.

I have been a fan of Dario Argento for quite some time now. His movies from 1975-1987 are some of his best work (""Suspiria"" being my absolute favorite) and it is obvious to anyone who has seen these films that he does not shy away from depicting loss of life on screen in detail. However in his earlier works, the death scenes looked too artistic to be believable. For instance, the oozing blood displayed was too red, too animated making the deaths look pretty and grotesque at the same time. What a difference a few decades make? Argento is now giving us straight up, repulsive, nasty gore and even more gore. The first episode from season 2 that I saw was Rob Schmidt's ""Right to Die"" and I thought it couldn't get gorier than that. Well Argento has proven me wrong. So wrong in fact that by the conclusion of this episode, I really didn't know how to react so I started laughing hysterically like Jessica Harper at the end of ""Suspiria"" only to discover my legs were numb and I felt quite nauseous. Argento made me realize that I do not have a high gore threshold which is somewhat disappointing. If you can stomach this amount of repulsiveness, than ""Pelts"" is the short movie for you. The gore effects are achingly grotesque and well done and the nudity is plentiful. So much so that the lead actress pretty much has her clothes off for practically every scene she is in (she is playing a stripper so it is fitting) but as lovely as she is to look at, the star of this show is the gore and the gore is just a prelude to even more gore and an even gorier climax.

Thanks Argento, your nasty film made me feel sensations I have never felt before and after watching this sick excursion into Argento-land, I think I can now stomach anything. I could go on about the cinematography and performances but there really is no point. No one will be watching this for the plot or the scenery or those lovely shots of those cutesy little raccoons looking sad and adorable in those barbaric animal traps. Nope. You will be tuning in for the gratuitous nudity and those elaborate, graphic depictions of self-mutilation and murder.

""Pelts"" is recommended to all MOH fans, Argento fans, horror fans, gore fans ..oh just watch the darn film, and have some Gravol next to you just in case. You have been warned.",1258243200,2,2981,4.516666666666667

2691834,3,B000KJTFBG,"Jake Feldman (Meat Loaf) runs a sweat shop specializing in fake furs. His frustration  with his lack of quality furs causes him to lash out at his mostly immigrant staff. What frustrates Jake even more are the unreturned advances of a stripper named Shanna (Ellen Ewusie) whom he is obsessed with. Jake pays her nightly visits and on one particular night things take a  terrifying turn in Jake's life . After he  almost rapes Shanna he gets a phone call from a trapper named Jameson (John Saxon). Jameson and his son have just caught the most beautiful raccoon furs imaginable and he is  offering Jake first pick of the merchandise. Before Jake can meet up with Jameson, Jameson's son, under the mysterious influence of the furs murders his father by bashing his head in with a metal bat and takes his own life by diving headfirst into a bear trap. The gore in this film is ridiculous and  over the top but still disgusting. It surprises me that this film aired with all of its extreme violence  yet Takashi Miike's offering was deemed too disturbing.  Once Jake sees the pelts he could care less about the mutilated bodies he has to step over to get to his prized possession. He declares them the best pelts he has seen in  twenty years and believes that they are just what he needs to get the two things he wants most out of life : a successful business and Shanna. He pays Shanna a visit at work (what she is doing when Jake arrives is  funny and erotic) and asks her to model the furs in an upcoming fashion show. Sensing an opportunity to manipulate Jake further Shanna teases him with sexual advances before agreeing to his wish. She wants the furs for herself. Jake does a little investigating and discovers that the furs are a special kind coming from magical raccoons who once presided over their own city. They were the guardians of that city and the magical powers that they once possessed now cause anyone who comes into contact with these furs to commit violent acts of self mutilation and murder. Each murder is in keeping with how these animals are slaughtered.  The film is a little goofy and over the top but Argento knows what people expect from  him and he doesn't disappoint. The murders are gross and there is tons of blood and intestines spilling all over the screen. Easier on the eyes is Shanna who is  a stripper who actually takes her clothes off in a movie. Some films you might read that an actress is half naked for most of the film but in this case it's not an exaggeration. Actress Ellen Ewusie appears nude in every scene that she has in this film.  Meat Loaf is a lot of  fun as Jake. His portrayal of a sleazy guy driven mad  by desire was so intense that I was reminded of Jack Nicholson at times. John Saxon makes you wish he had more scenes before he is brutally murdered. The score by regular Argento composer Claudio Simonetti is very spooky and recalls the nursery rhyme from Deep Red in a couple of scenes towards the end. Pelts is gross as hell but it's one of the funnest horror films in a while since it tells a crazy story about murderous raccoons and features  tons of gratuitous gore and nudity.",1235520000,2,3142,4.466783216783217

2691836,2,B000KJTFBG,"Let me precede this review with a disclaimer.  I absolutely love Dario Argento.  He is easily one of the most amazing horror film creators in the business.  I started with ""Suspiria"" and moved along his line of movies from there.  The man is a horror god.  That said, I was not impressed with ""Pelts.""

I love gore and nudity as much as the next guy.  There was plenty of both in this movie.  The kills in this movie are insane.  This movie is for horror veterans.  Definitely requires a strong stomach.  The kills are very original and done in terrific Dario Argento flair.  However, that is about the only positive in this movie.

Story - Trappers go where they shouldn't and trap some sort of mystical spirit raccoons.  Now everyone that comes into contact with the ""Pelts"" will end up creatively killing themselves.  Kill themselves is an understatement.  They seem to be under some sort of spell and they don't seem to feel pain.  The suicides are very graphic and creative.  That is it for the storyline.  That is what this movie is about and I am not even joking.

As a Dario Argento fan I have become accustomed to a certain cinematic artistry that tends to set Argento apart from other filmmakers.  ""Pelts"" was void of this as well.  I didn't find the filming to be unique or interesting at all.  It was a very simple movie in all aspects.  Simple story, simple execution.  The death scenes were the only thing that was obviously done with care.  Those scenes came out great, but there is nothing to supplement the death.

I feel bad slamming this movie.  I might be missing something.  I just truly feel like Argento can do so much better.  Still fun to watch if you are looking for something over the top gory.",1225324800,,1721,4.511400651465798
2691837,3,B000KJTFBG,"Italian horror scribe Dario Argento's second season ""Masters of Horror"" is a short film called ""PELTS"". The short film is based on the short story by F. Paul Wilson with its teleplay written by Matt Venne. Dario Argento is a master of horror indeed, while this installment isn't necessarily the best among the ""Masters of Horror"" series, it may well be one of the goriest.

Jake Feldman (Meatloaf Aday) is a short-tempered eccentric furrier struggling to build a small-time business in fur coats while being obsessed with a very sexy stripper (Ellen Ewusie). One day, a sadistic backwoods trapper (John Saxon) kills a strange group of raccoons and calls Jake to sell the ""special"" raccoon hide. Jake knows that quality pelts can help him make it big in the fur business. The problem is, these are no ordinary pelts; anyone who comes in contact with them are driven insane--to perform acts of self-mutilation and murder. Even if Jake does manage to possess both the fame and the sexy stripper he so covets, what is the price to be paid?

PELTS isn't really a scary short film. The film's plot is so severely underdeveloped and fails to induce a decent scare. Instead of creating a spooky atmosphere, with the characters being fleshed out (or in this case ""fleshed off"") so you can form an attachment to them, the film goes into a different direction. The film goes for a gross-out experience that really tries to push the envelope. The film does provide a lot of fun in terms of blood and gore. Argento relies on some CGI effects but most of the film's key sequences are done in the old-school way; using prosthetics and a lot of red ink. The gore scenes are actually a lot of fun to watch, but with the film's lack of an enthralling storyline, the film fails to be very memorable.

The film has a lot of holes in its script and the so-proclaimed curse of the pelts needed a lot of (ahem) development. To Argento's credit, the film is nicely paced and the performances seem solid enough. Greed, selfishness and lust all play into our main characters. The mutilation and death sequences are inventive enough to give me an unsettling grossed out feeling. The film also has subtle injections of commentary against animal cruelty and such.

The performances of the cast is quite acceptable. Meat Loaf Aday has a very specific talent in playing an unlikable character and the role fits him to a `T'. Together with Ellen Ewusie as a gold-digging stripper, the two does have a certain amount of chemistry between them--an odd one, honestly, but chemistry nonetheless. The two does manage to make the most of whatever small material they have to work with.

PELTS is a decent entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" series and I had a lot of fun watching it. Gorehounds will have a reason to rejoice and as with most entries in the series, the film does have an abundance in female nudity and sex. The weakness in its story makes it rather difficult to look past the gore elements, but whatever little key elements it does have sure provide a lot of fun. Dario Argento is definitely capable of better outings but at least, ""Pelts"" isn't the let down I feared.

Recommended to horror/gore fans, and a good rental to everybody else. [3 - Stars]",1224460800,,3226,4.660808435852372

2691840,4,B000KJTFBG,"'Pelts' is based on a short story by F. Paul Wilson, and is one of the Masters Of Horror series.  Jake Feldman (played by Meat Loaf, perfect for the role) is a nasty tempered fur trader obsessed with a stripper named Shana (Ellen Ewusie).  Animal trappers Pa and Jr Jameson trap some raccoons at an old sacred site, an animal in every trap.  They've hit pay dirt.  The raccoons are odd, strangely docile, and are wearing the most beautiful pelts the trappers have ever seen.

But the pelts are cursed, the animals sacred.  After skinning the raccoons and touching the pelts, Jr goes crazy and kills Pa with a bat, then commits suicide by putting his face in a bear trap (a most awesome, gory scene to be sure!).  Feldman comes out to buy the pelts, finds the bodies, and steals the pelts.  He has big plans for the pelts, to make the most beautiful coat in the world and have Shana model it.

Along the way, many people touch the pelts.  Those who touch the pelts become cursed, and are driven to brutal acts of self-mutilation.  Those adorable, furry little critters leave a swath of bloody violence in their wake.  The movie is cheap, but the FX is pretty decent (especially the faceless corpse of Jr).  There's enough gore to satisfy the horror fanatic, and enough plot to carry it through.  'Pelts' was a surprise to me, one of those 'B' movie gems that you find once in awhile on the sale rack.  My only problem is that there is no subtitles, not even for the hearing impaired.  Rent first, but I wound out purchasing.  Enjoy!",1222905600,,1531,4.469314079422382
2691841,4,B000KJTFBG,"For me, this flick answered a lot of questions about the fur industry.  For example, what would happen if you stuck your face in an animal trap?  Or, what would happen if you were a trapper and came upon a slew of raccoons whose fur was so lustrous that you just had to slaughter and skin them all (like John Saxon does)?  Or, what would happen if you made a coat out of these rare furs to impress your lady friend (as Meat Loaf does)?  The answers to all of these questions is:  bad, spooky, gory, inexplicable things happen.  I'm sure the folks from PETA are saying, ""Serves them right!""  But the game here is not politics, it's horror, and boy does Pelts deliver the goods.  If you like movies that are guaranteed to give you nightmares, you want this one.",1218326400,,759,4.333333333333333

You've got people sticking their heads in steel traps, sewing their own nose and mouth shut, gutting themselves, and, of course, what Meat Loaf does at the end in EXCRUCIATINGLY slow detail.
I guess it's all about what one man will do for a piece of pie, and what raccoons will do when you mess with them.

I read good things about this one (hi Chris and M!) so I decided to pick it up. And boy am I glad I did. If you want to sit back and enjoy a good gore fest then I would definitely recommend this. Argento definitely does not hold back with the grossness. I haven't been happily goriefied in quite some time. And not only that... we are also blessed with a ton of nudity. So much nudity that I actually kind of felt bad about our main actress cause I think she was topless for about 90% of her scenes. And then we have Meatloaf. You can never go wrong when Man-Boob Bob is in your movie. He played his part wonderfully in Pelts as a horny, sleazy, and uncaring fur coat maker looking for a big paycheck.

Oh... the story is about some raccoons with some guardian spirits in them. They die and get skinned. But their guardian spirits live on and get revenge.

2691846,4,B000KJTFBG,"Dario Argento's second episode for the Masters of Horror TV series, Pelts, is a distinct improvement on his first, Jenifer, and also probably the goriest thing he's ever done. Again, surprises aren't really on the menu, but this time the execution is a lot more inspired, especially since the show seems to be on a dare to see just how far it can go and doesn't chicken out. The story is a fairly simple don't muck with Mother Nature one as everyone who comes into contact with a series of beautiful racoon pelts, from John Saxon's grizzled trapper to Meat Loaf's desperate furrier and the stripper he lusts after, meet increasingly gory ends that mirror the various stages from trap to fur coat. The visuals are good, making much play on cages and traps without being over-obvious, while Claudio Simonetti's score gives the pelts themselves a seductively beautiful theme and there's a particularly good performance from Meat Loaf Aday. The featurette on the DVD also reveals that the racoons themselves are played, rather convincingly at that, by West Highland Terriers in fur coats...

Thankfully, the legendary gore master returns to form with Pelts, which is undoubtedly one of the best Masters of Horror episodes ever made.  Meat Loaf stars as Jake, an ultra sleezy fur trader who comes across some extremely priceless raccoon furs, that also turn out to be extremely cursed.  Anyone who touches them will kill themselves in some outrageously gory ways, which may be among the best gore effects you'll likely see in the second season of Masters of Horror.  Though the storyline involving mystical raccoons may be a bit much, and Argento's camera work is less than stunning, Pelts ends up being very memorable thanks to Meat Loaf's surprisingly good performance, and some superb gore effects.  Seriously, Pelts boasts some of the grossest and most well done makeup and gore effects to grace the series, and only stands as more great work from KNB.  Along for the ride are legendary B-movie god John Saxon, and Ellen Ewusie as a lesbian stripper that Jake takes more than a liking to.

It's easy to overlook this weak storyline due to all the gore and nudity.  Fright Master Dario Argento is the best with gruesome deaths, and he doesn't hold back here.  There were a few disgusting self-mutilation scenes that looked way too realistic.

Pelt's has none of the atmosphere of Argento's 70's and 80's flick's, no Goblin music, no color's, barely any of his trademark cinematography, no trippy nightmarish qaulity's, but for what it lack's in substance.......................it make's up for with LOAD'S OF GORE and NUDITY!!!!!!!

Warning: Even though I'm a vegan, don't let that influence you when reading my review. Of course, I'm happy the characters got it in karmic spades, but I am a horror fan and feel I can contribute an unbiased critique of Argento's work.

With that said, allow me to continue: This has it all: sex, nudity, girl-on-girl, seedy people, pretty girls, blood, more blood, gore galore, humor, etc. For me, I walked away with a huge feeling of satisfaction from the conclusion of this horrific installment. Everyone connected to the racoon slaughter got what they deserved--big time!

I'd like to insert spoilers here but I know that wouldn't be fair to you. So, all I can say is go rent or buy this DVD and see if it isn't the very best episode in the whole MOH series.

To my fellow veggies, if you can stomach one racoon killing which is of course fake, then by all means watch it. You'll not be disappointed by how karma grabs her victims by the jugular and rips their throats out.

I still shudder when I think about it.",1187481600,6,1287,4.409282700421941
2691852,5,B000KJTFBG,"After watching Argento's ""Jennifer"" first and then ""Pelts"", the difference was obvious to me.  Where ""Jennifer"" had a more murkier approach to its story--we are brought in the middle where Jennifer makes yet another appearance in someone's life and we have learned nothing about her past or who she is and what her motivations are--you will be left with no doubt where you stand by the end of ""Pelts"".  Everything works with this MOH installment.  Meatloaf gives a terrific performance as this perpetually pissed off furrier who obsesses over a stripper half his age.  Knowing he can't have her just seems to egg him on (and piss him off) more.  Then you get these magical raccoons thrown into the mix.  This is the one murky spot in the story--you only know that they come from an enchanted raccoon city that just happens to be beyond a neighbor's cow pasture.  Yeah, I don't know where that one came from either.  But the pelts are cursed and anyone who touches them has their fate sealed-and ended by some kind of grisly act of self-mutilation.  I'm not giving anything away here, you'll figure this out after the first 10 minutes or so.  The real story is the erotic cat and mouse game that Mealoaf's character and the stripper play with each other throughout the film.  I'm not one for sexual tension as a main story theme, but this one has a HUGE payoff at the story's ending, which is quite amazing.  When you see it, you'll definitely say holy cow.  If you are familiar with Argento's previous masterpieces, then you'll recognize the elements:  the very eerie music by Claudio Simonetti, the leader of the band Goblin (they did the music for ""Susperia"" and Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead""), the surreal multi-colored lighting, and the over-the-top violence that is poetry in and of itself.  The extras are somewhat more sparse than what we have been accustomed to from the first season.  There is a small featurette about the making of the episode; another featurette about the special make up effects; the screen play and of course a commentary track, this time with the writer instead of the actor or director.  My only beef about that is how ""Pelts"" wasn't even Matt Venne's story--he lifted it from the far superior F.Paul Wilson (whom some of you might remember wrote The Keep)--now a commentary by him would have been interesting!  It will also be interesting in the future to see if Argento collaborates with his daughter Asia for another MOH entry.  Thank you, Dario, for this one, however!",1186963200,3,2502,4.75

2691854,2,B000KJTFBG,"I agree with cglambdin's review. This movie is the perfect example of what is wrong with the MOH series: poor writing, underwhelming production values, and has-been directors who are given a sense of false confidence simply by being invited to participate.

Watching the behind-the-scenes featurette was painful, as Argento talks with utter seriousness about this utterly ridiculous film. In his other films, he has proved to be at his best when creating scenes of suspense involving an unknown killer, but here the villains are enchanted raccoons. There is just no way to relate to the scenario!

The special effects are okay, sort of. The final bodysuit for Meat Loaf is pretty cool, but the first shot of a guy stabbing himself in the stomach looks as fake as a fat-suit from Wal-Mart. I really enjoyed Deer Woman, John Landis' first MOH offering, and Sick Girl was pretty good, but almost  everything beyond that in this series has been an insult to horror fans, an excuse to further a political agenda, an incoherent mess, or all three. Throwing cheap-looking gore around does not make it better.

IMHO, the focus needs to be on the writing more than the directing.",1181433600,,1170,4.893939393939394
2691855,5,B000KJTFBG,"Jake Feldman (Meat Loaf) is a fur-trading business man who falls for a beautiful stripper  (Ellen Ewusie) and wants to create a special furcoat for her. Unknown to him, the pelts come from a group of magical raccoons that were killed and whoever touches the pelts will commit self-mutilation and suicide.

One of the most entertaining and most gruesome episodes of Masters of Horror from the Italian horror master Dario Argento of ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno"" fame. The story co-stars John Saxton and contains a good amount of graphic gore like a man getting his faced sliced in half, eyes sawned etc. and some good nudity from the gorgeous Ellen Ewusie who's almost better then Elizabeth Berkley from ""Showgirls"" when it comes to sexy strippers on the screen.

The DVD contains audio commentary by writer Matt venne, still gallery, storyboard gallery, and two featurettes with a bio of Dario Argento.",1180569600,,897,5.006711409395973
2691856,4,B000KJTFBG,"Just finished watching pelts, the latest Dario Argento masters of horror entry and i have to say that i'm blown away by how great this one hour movie is. anyone who is reading this knows what the basic premise of the film is, so i won't go into it- but i will say this:

Pelts has got to be Meat Loaf's best performance since Fight Club.

The use of Color in this film is VERY Argento.

The music was BEAUTIFUL, done by one of the original members of Goblin (the band that did most of Argentos soundtracks). PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEEEAAASSSEE, RELEASE THIS AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!!!!!

The Gore was probably the most over the top for a MOH film since Imprint- yet, you FEEL it when the mutilations happen, making it far more disturbing then Takashi Miike's banned effort. BTW- the finale of Pelts is disgustingly depraved!

LOTS of T&A! now personally, i don't really care if my horror is full of nudity and sex, but let me just say this for the record- YOU WON'T HEAR ME COMPLAIN- EVER!!!

Finally, the dvd comes with a useful Argento bio and filmography (yet they failed to include his previous MOH effort Jenifer?), a short film on the making of Pelts including all the demented joy Dario goes through during filming, plus a really great commentary by the screenplay writer, who wrote Pelts based on a short story.

This is not only the BEST masters of horror film I've seen yet, It is also one of the greatest Dario Argento films he has ever made.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",1180051200,2,1466,4.547528517110266
2691857,2,B000KJTFBG,"While I love horror... Pelts in many ways was a little too ""over the top""  for my taste.  I was extremely grossed out by some of the scenes. But then again my tastes leans towards the more classic horror movies and not the ""slash and guts"" genre of many of today's horror movies. I would not recommend this movie for the faint of heart ( though faint of stomache would be a better phrase).",1179187200,,389,4.243243243243243
2691858,3,B000KJTFBG,"This gory, somewhat perverted entry in the Masters of Horror series offers us Dario Argento's take on sexual perversion and greed.  Meat Loaf Aday (reminding me of Randy Quaid) plays a furrier who has an obsession with a local stripper and offers her a beautiful coonskin coat.  Only trouble is the pelts came from a haunted forest, taken by John Saxon and his son.  Whoever comes in contact with the pelts becomes dangerously murderous, either to others or themselves.

Argento's mastery of atmospheric tension aids this otherwise silly tale.",1177632000,,543,5.067415730337078
2691859,4,B000KJTFBG,"I didn't start watching the Masters of Horror TV show until the DVD's started coming out last year and I ended up buying all of them. Most of the episodes were really good with some being outstanding, while only a couple were so-so. So when the second season was ready to hit DVD I immediately snatched up the first episode released, Pelts.

This is another entry by Dario Argento, the Italian horror master. Jenifer was a decent contribution to the first season and if anything it was beautifully shot. Pelts is once again shot wonderfully and this time the story is more enjoyable. Simply enough, Meatloaf plays a fur maker who wants to impress a stripper who wants nothing to do with him. He comes into contact with some sacred raccoon furs, which he uses to make a coat that he wants the stripper to wear to a fashion show. This being an episode of Masters of Horror, the raccoon furs cause those who touch them to freak out and kill themselves in brutal ways, leading to a bloodbath of an ending.

This is probably the goriest and most brutal episode of the series that I've seen, but it's also one of the best. Argento is definitely a master and he shows off his skills here. The story isn't the most original, killing animals and making jackets=bad stuff, but it's the execution that makes this one worthwhile.",1175472000,,1317,4.552742616033755

8157214,5,B000KJTFBG,"This episode from Season Two of Masters of Horror, sold separately by Amazon as a single movie, is a horror classic from Italy's Alfred Hitchcock - Dario Argento, the undisputed master of the horror genre since he launched the trilogy that propelled him into fame and popularity among Italian audiences and the world over, beginning with the movie, Suspiria, that effectively earned him wide-scale recognition internationally, and stars Meatloaf in his second on-screen  appearance since Little Shop of Horror. Probably the best episode of the Horror of Masters series, Pelts will make you think twice before buying a fur coat and will most likely be loved by all animal rights activists.

The story revolves around a father and son team, bent on bashing in the skulls of coons in order to skin them for their beautiful fur which they, then, sell to Meatloaf's firm in order for them to make fur coats; only to find that the coons possess super normal powers that enable them to exact revenge on those who have killed them or utilized their fur to make coats, with each dying in just the manner in which they had harmed the coons - the son being made to bash the father's head in the same manner his father had bashed in the coons' skull, the son committing suicide, by bashing his own skull in the coons' trap in the way the coons had their skulls bashed in by his father's trap, the worker for Meatloaf ripping out his guts in the manner in which Meatloaf had made him skin the coons, another of Meatloaf's worker sewing her eyes and mouth shut in the manner she had been made to sew the coons' fur into a fur coat, and  Meatloaf skinning himself in the manner he had skinned the coon; and, in so doing, to offer his skin to a model with whom he is obsessed only to find her being repulsed and being crushed by a lift shaft when she attempts to escape him in his hideous condition without his skin.

The theme revolves around the animals that have been harmed by man exacting revenge, in what constitute an outcry against using the fur of animals to make fur coats, a message that will resonate strongly among animal rights activists throughout the world and appeal to organizations such as the SPCA.",1356134400,,2202,4.581218274111675
8157215,1,B000KJTFBG,"I now watch these programs with a kind of perverse fascination.  Despite an occasional success, they are almost uniformly disappointing.  Here we have legendary director Dario Argento working from an adaptation of a short story by the well-regarded horror author F. Paul Wilson, and it is just terrible.  The whole arc of the story is clear very early on (okay, everyone who encounters these furs is going to go mad and kill themselves and/or others), after which it just plods along to the end with no surprises, reversals, or interesting developments.  By the way, I know a real raccoon will rip your face off if you surprise it while its going through your garbage, but as an antagonist in a horror film, it's just silly.

This particular pelt however posseses powers which control peoples feelings, as it did with lead stripper Ellen Ewusie.  She became so much in lust with Meat Loaf that he had to keep away from her.
