1671760,5,B00005V4XB,"(02 JUN '04- 16H24) Wonderful, wonderful...Andrea combines his sentiments and vocals into a delightful package of personal narration, music videos, and so much more. Subtitles may be activated for Andrea's spoken Italian. I reposed to ""Tuscan Skies"" [on REPLAY!] and woke up in a rather serene, uplifted mood. Encore, ladies and gentleman.

1671761,5,B00005V4XB,"This DVD is very well made.  Both the music and the visuals are superb!  If you love Bocelli, then you must get this DVD.  After listening to Bocelli on Digital Dolby or DTS, there is no going back to CD.",1076716800,8,204,4.05
1671762,5,B00005V4XB,"I first saw this on PBS.  Andrea Bocelli, as always sings beautifully in it.  All the songs are mostly from his new cd of tuscany.  He sings in the warmth of hs own country and town. All the songs are beautifully and lovingly sung  But this and you won't regret it.  It's one of his best.",1031011200,11,288,4.071428571428571
1671763,5,B00005V4XB,"All of Andrea fans should get this vhs. It is much more then you saw on tv. One scene shows Andrea playing a flute and a father and his baby is shown during the lullaby song. The surprise is thirty more minutes of Andrea getting ready for each song ,speaking with producer ,camera men,his translators etc. You feel that you are right there with him in Tuscany. Highly recommended!!",1014249600,22,381,4.536231884057971
1671764,5,B00005V4XB,"The Tuscan Skies (Cieli Di Toscana) DVD is a must have for the Andrea Bocelli Fan. For anyone who has seen this on TV this is DVD quality and sound with two extra video's not included on the TV show (Lincontro and Mascagni). The DVD includes 10 Videos from the album (Melodrama, Il Mistero Dell'Amore, L'Icontro, L'Ultimo Re, L'Abitudine, Resta Qui, Milli Lune Milli Orde, Mascangni, E Sara' A Settembre, E Mi Machi Tu), and the bonus Video Tornera' La Neve. Its worth it just for the bonus song alone, but there is much much more. All the Videos are beautifully shot and represent Andreas life and his fantasies. The DVD also includes the whole Album with slide shows running during the songs (in a way like Videos), mostly picture's shot during the recording of the video, plus some extra from home. The Album includes two bonus alternative version of L""Incontro (he French and Italian version of the Poem). Other bonus materiel are Interviews, Behind the Scenes Footage, Career Highlights, and a Track Synopses.",1011657600,78,1014,4.833333333333333
1671765,4,B00005V4XB,"This is fantastic.  I am Italian and love Tuscany and the people's way of life.  But this is an extension in music/dvd form of Andrea's recently published book ""The Music of Silence"".  If you have the background of his memoirs you will find this not only beautiful but very touching into the heart of the very man himself.  Bravo to Andrea!  A MUST.",1011398400,34,349,4.476190476190476

1671785,5,B00005V4XB,The wife and I love this man's voice!  I imagine that his is the voice of God were he to sing for us.  Much has been required of him but very much has been given to him.  I have over time collected many or most of his albums and DVD videos.  I await his next releases always as this allows us to enjoy them without attending concerts.  I am 75 and do not enjoy concerts at this point in my life.,1367539200,,395,3.8271604938271606
1671786,5,B00005V4XB,"A well done DVD. Lovely photography, music and personal commentaries. I also liked the English subtitles. I would highlyrecommend this DVD.",1365724800,,139,5.666666666666667
1671787,5,B00005V4XB,"What beautiful scenery; this along with Andrea Bocelli singing to me what more could a woman want?
This DVD is a treasure.  It shows you how deeply this tenor appreciates family, nature, music.  I truly enjoyed this and hope others will also.",1326672000,,242,4.738095238095238
1671788,5,B00005V4XB,"This dvd is beautiful, interesting, and has some of Andreas most beautiful songs included. You hear about his early life and the things he loves about Tuscany. It is part documentary, part performance. This is a great addition to any fan's collection. I recommend Andrea's 'Under the Desert Sky' if you want a beautiful, romantic concert.",1299369600,,338,5.053571428571429
1671789,4,B00005V4XB,Andrea Bocelli performs with exceptional skill.  His voice has a quality seldom found.  A one in a million voice which has been carefully nurtured and trained.,1262822400,,159,5.076923076923077
1671790,5,B00005V4XB,This video reveals a side of Bocelli not seen before........It gives you a sense of who he really is.......An Italian tenor who is alot more than just another great voice.......I especially admired his deep feeling for his roots and his interaction with his family.......I enjoyed the whole experience........,1225324800,,309,5.458333333333333
1671791,5,B00005V4XB,"I hadn't really planned to purchase this DVD, but now I am so thrilled I did as it has given me hours of pure enjoyment.  The video images that accompany each song were planned as a journey into the life of Andrea Bocelli, from childhood to present day.  The exquisite photography of the Tuscan region is in itself worth the price of the DVD.  Their images evoke a connection with the history of the region while offering the promise of a beautiful future. The biographical pieces offer a glimpse into the history of Andrea Bocelli and his family, and they also share with us Andrea's love and regard for his beloved Tuscany.  The music speaks for itself and together with the images weaves beautiful tapestries that draw in the listener as if sharing a private secret.  One can hear the passion of this beautiful land in Andrea's voice and share in the beauty as you watch.",1212537600,2,874,4.576923076923077
1671802,5,B00005V4XB,"If you love Andrea, you will love this beautiful DVD. The scenery alone is reason enough to buy it. But of course, it is Andrea and his gorgeous voice that makes it a 5 star!",1189036800,2,174,4.0
1671803,5,B00005V4XB,"I own many of Andrea Bocelli's CDs and some I like better than others. On the Tuscan Skies CD he embraces a more contemporary, more sensual, if you will, style of singing that combines the wonderful richness of his tone with a skilled phrasing technique and delicious warmth of delivery. His duet with Stevie Wonder is fabulous and the ""Bessa me mucho"" makes you wanna dance. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1184976000,2,396,4.838235294117647
1671804,5,B00005V4XB,I really enjoy this DVD.  I love his music the scenes from Tuscany are just beautiful adding to his beautiful voice.,1175212800,6,116,4.523809523809524

1671806,3,B00005V4XB,"Andrea Bocelli was brilliant as always; however, the director and producer did not demonstrate equal surpassing excellence.",1171065600,3,123,6.294117647058823
1671807,5,B00005V4XB,"Watching Tuscan Skies, I cry because Bocelli touches my heart.  He hits a place no one else can.  The tears just flowed with the beauty of his voice.  What a journey this man has had.  Thank God he has chosen to share his gift with us all.  Thank you Andrea.",1169856000,6,258,4.08
1671808,2,B00005V4XB,"I'm sorry to be the party pooper here, but I think this DVD is overly sentimental; it forces emotion and lacks substancial debth.  Yes, the scenery is stunning, but the beauty of human relationships it attempts to convey is lacking.  The scenes of the male model holding the baby for example, are just plain silly.  I don't feel any love or relational debth when I watch them.  It's just some guy with an above average body holding a baby as though he's not quite sure what to do with it.

With that said, the best chapter on the DVD was ""L'Abitudine"" with Andrea and Helena Hellwig at the recording studio.  That was raw and real.

Andrea Bocelli's singing is beautiful; and this DVD fails to do that beauty justice.",1143244800,9,717,4.511627906976744
1671809,5,B00005V4XB,"OMG!!! Absolutely OMG!!! I like the songs in his CD ""Cieli di Toscana"" pretty much already, but this DVD mixed with the MTV that make the songs sound 10 times better!! It makes me feel like I understand and feel the songs more deeply and more passionately. When Bocelli's voice came out, u just cant resist but stay in front of the TV to listen he sings and watch the gorgeous MTV. Overall it brings u to the inside world of the songs. Personally I like the video of E Sara' A Settembre the most, but actually all videos are worth more than 10 stars. I am only 22, but I choose to listen bocelli's masterpieces instead of those stupid pops that has no talent or even no voices. This shows how charming bocelli's songs and voice are, I can guarantee after u listening and watching this, u would understand what ""beautiful music"" really means. Trust me~",1138406400,10,851,4.426751592356688
1671810,5,B00005V4XB,"I really enjoyed seeing photos and videos from his childhood. Not only do you get to experience his homeland but scenes from his life.

This is put to music that is next to perfection. This guy is so gorgeous it's almost unreal.

Beautiful, beautiful man...",1136160000,10,257,4.688888888888889
1671811,3,B00005V4XB,"I love Bocelli, and have his live concert DVD, ""A Night in Tuscany"". (Loved that one, by the way) I thought ""Tuscan Skies"" would be a live concert also.

When I watched the DVD, it was just a bunch of still photos, one after another. Yes they were nice photos, but I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it, hoping to find at least one live performance. I don't have the interest or patience to sit and look at a slide show! No offense to those folks who loved this DVD, I understand everyone has different tastes. If I had it to do over again, I'd just stick to listening to my CD of this one.",1134000000,30,599,4.076271186440678
