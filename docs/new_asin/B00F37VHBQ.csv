5963924,5,B00F37VHBQ,"When I received the advance screener of the DVD from PBS Home Video I knew it was about World War I, but not much else. It hadnt aired on PBS yet to my knowledge and isn't part of any of the PBS series like Masterpiece Theater. But once I started watching it, I was hooked. The acting is great and the production clever. I don't want to tell you too much of the story line (I HATE spoilers!) as you will enjoy it best by discovering it the way I did.

The 95-minute (pkg says 90 minutes but its a bit longer) film was produced by the BBC as a joint project by the Northern Ireland Screen Fund in 2013.  Its based on the true story of a group of British soldiers stationed in the Belgium town of Ypres during World War I. They find an old printing press and decide to up the morale of the troops by publishing a satirical newspaper (sort of like Punch for the war effort). How they do it, what the 20 page weekly contains and how the military brass react to the project Ill let you discover for yourself.

The director used three types of lighting and color in the firm. It opens  after the War  in London and in full color. The majority of the film  basically as flashback  is presented in muted colors. And within that section various articles and advertisements from the Times are presented as music-hall skits in black and white. These skits are reminiscent of Joel Grey or Alan Cummings scenes as the MC in Cabaret (which  of course was set in the SECOND World War.). All cleverly done.

Youll find yourself cracking a smile when you least expect it.  The text epilogue: will tell you why you probably never hear of the men of this unit (especially their leader Fred Roberts (played brilliantly by actor Ben Chaplin - who, by the way, is not related to the great Charlie). Monty Python alum Michael Palin is probably the only other name you will recognize in the cast.

The DVD has no bonus features but stands on its own. Even if the First World War is not of interest to you, I urge you to give this little gem of a film a chance. I did, and it was a well-spent 95 minutes.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5963925,4,B00F37VHBQ,"a fine little film about the first world war that doesn't glorify things, but offers a look at what the men there did to keep their sanity. from this distance it's hard to imagine anything humorous at all about such a bleak and awful time in history. it was clever.",1403308800,11,265,4.32
5963926,5,B00F37VHBQ,"Brilliant movie starring Ben Chaplin, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Michael Palin and Ben Daniels, about a group of World War I British officers who started a newspaper by and for the troops at the front lines.  Its satirical tone made it loved by the men but not so popular with some senior officers back at headquarters.  Chaplin is brilliant as the editor, and the stylishly creepy musical hall recreations of pieces in the paper are amazing.  Very engrossing from beginning to end.  Deserves to be seen in the US lest we forget.",1396396800,26,521,4.7555555555555555

5963940,5,B00F37VHBQ,"Co written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman this tells the story of Fred Roberts and his lieutenant and friend Jack Pearson. While based in Ypres, Belgium they discover a near working printing press. Their Sergeant used to work in newspapers and with his help they set up a satirical magazine and name it `The Wipers Times' - in honour of the way `Tommie's pronounce Ypres.

They go for the ludicrous - where ever possible - and often take a swipe at those in command, but the paper is a hit and soon they are getting noticed. This is set during the destruction and slaughter of World War I and that is included in the film, as well as mustard gas, food shortages and the filth of the trenches. The film recreates some of the sketches from the papers as black and white pieces using the same characters and this adds to the surreal nature of the paper and how it was a break from reality for those that read it.

Starring Ben Chaplin as Roberts and Julian Rhind-Tutt as Pearson who are both perfect castings for their respective roles, this was produced by the BBC to mark the anniversary of `The Great War', along with other memorable films and series. This I felt was one of the best and dealt with an aspect of war that is often missed out, at one time it is said that `war is nothing more than wallowing in a dirty ditch'; well this proved that humour could take men out of that ditch if even for a short time. Absolutely recommended and a credit to all involved in its production.",1432771200,2,1482,4.346570397111913
5963941,5,B00F37VHBQ,"When a British regiment mired in the mindless morass and carnage of WWI on the Western Front finds a printing press in a bombed out Belgian town, they soon publish a newspaper filled with satiric humor which serves as a morale builder and allows soldiers to vent their frustrations against an insane war of attrition.  The acting is first rate and at the end of the film we are told more about the later lives of the front line officers who conceived of this newspaper.  Fortunately, a more enlightened general allows the newspaper to continue despite a jingoistic subordinate incessant demands to quash this seditious paper.  We do not have to see the carnage to appreciate the utter lunacy as armies slog through the mud, back and forth, to contend for a few yards of territory at the cost of thousands of lives before again being looked in stalemate.",1431907200,3,853,4.7114093959731544

5963943,5,B00F37VHBQ,"The war in Belgium and northern France was ghastly yet ""Wipers Times"" tells the true story with a lightness that shows the
tragedy of trench warfare but in an engaging way. Does one part seem to contradict the other? Indeed, but that's what makes
this movie so important. You learn about the Battle of Ypres and what the  soldiers endured, but you see how the creative spirit could rise above
even  that.  The actors are terrific.  In one memorable scene, the general(Michael Palin) tells the editor of the paper (Ben Chaplin) that
he and his crew are in for a pleasant change from Ypres.  ""You'll be stationed at The Somme.""  And we all know that the Battle of the Somme
was a horror for the British.  But the newspaper survived even that. This movie is highly recommended during this period of remembering World War I.",1430265600,4,820,4.613793103448276

5963951,5,B00F37VHBQ,"Based on true events in World War I, although how much so and how much is romanticised or exaggerated I don't know.  But the film is a nice pleasant viewing experience.  Even though it is set on the front lines of World War I, I don't recall ever seeing anyone killed at all in the film, there's a few in the trenches or running over them towards enemy lines moments, but there's nothing like the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan.  Like with movies like The Great Escape, Monuments Men (I can't think of a War I movie that is like this) and other loosely based on real events war movies, the actual war going on is mentioned a lot but we never experience it, instead we just follow the quirky stuff that some characters did when they weren't participating in combat.

With Wipers Times, a newspaper printed to give the British boys on the front something to read before they need to wipe (hence the name).  The name would change as the war did with the final edition Better Times.  This movie follows those who wrote the paper, and their superiors, one who wants the paper banned and the insubordination writers shot. Luckily he's pretty much alone in that view.  The movie is told as a flashback recall, by a man who is in a Northern Ireland newspaper job interview, to a man who had some sort of excuse why he didn't serve.  The tone of the movie is always light, and there's lot of granddad corny type humour including little skits the soldiers did in a theatre in the town they occupied giving humorous advice to each other through poetry and dance.

This is a fun feel good movie, even though it's technically a war film, it's still a family friendly film. My favourite part of the film was when they re-enacted the serious paper journalist who writes his on the front line report while in a tavern a long way away from any chance of being killed.",1416787200,12,1857,4.438235294117647

5963953,5,B00F37VHBQ,"This short film is an outstanding depiction of little known attempts by a small group of men to maintain their sanity in the trenches of France and Flanders during the latter part of the 1914-18 War.  The response of senior leadership to this send up of the war effort is interesting to watch and listen to.  The cast of characters is standard British outstanding.  The choice of Michael Palin for his role was perfect.

In this start up of the memorialization of the start of the 1914-18 War, this film should be in the library of all student`s of this war.",1415318400,13,558,4.4950495049504955
5963954,5,B00F37VHBQ,"Just a good movie about WW I, what soldiers did to relieve the bordom, and raise moral, without the platitudes of well wishers. I would not call this stellar, but the acting was sound and the story well put together, very little battle or gore, but you really want for these men to live through what is still considered the most terrible of wars.",1413763200,8,346,4.421875

8611837,5,B00F37VHBQ,"Film-making at its best; a thought- and emotion-provoking piece of entertainment whose poignance and relevance are a credit to human creativity. A multi-dimensional teleplay that seemlessly displays the seeringly sarcastic satire of a true-to-life front-line rag that was produced by soldiers in (and for) the British battle trenches of World War I's Western Front, The Wipers Times is a superbly crafted film with equally poignant scenes of life in the trenches, in the the thick of battle, as well as sobering glimpses into the dissociative ignorance of those humans (both military and civilian) not ""privileged"" to have experienced the front lines of war. The performances of the lead actors (Chaplin, Patrick FitzSymons, Michael Palin, and Ben Daniels) as Captain Roberts' ""troupe"" of Sherwood Foresters' 12th Battalion underground thespians are outstanding in rendering all spectrums of human emotion, not just the humour of the absurdities and vagaries of war.
