8586658,3,B00CV1PHRW,"It's really not that good, the scenery is nice to look at.  The scene with Apache Indians getting shot up by a few white people hiding behind a small river bed was probably the most idiotic thing.  That scene knocked it down plenty.

And it didn't start that badly.",1451347200,,265,4.36734693877551
8586659,1,B00CV1PHRW,Other than the actors being sons or daughter of famous western movies stars this movie has little to recommend it - and their acting abilities are nowhere near those of their famous fathers. The story and how it plays out is just plain corny. I watched it on TV recently and didn't purchase it from Amazon.,1440892800,,306,4.482142857142857
8586660,3,B00CV1PHRW,"Let's start out by saying that James Mitchum, Alana Ladd and Jody McCrea are not up to snuff with their more famous sibs and dads. having said that and knowing that theses 3 are going to be very bad let's watch this movie with that knowledge and do what we can with it. it is the standard cowboy movie. Guns, Indians, land barons, pseudo preachers (God Bless, Chill Wills) and the new guy, Gary Conway. If not for Chill and Gary this could have been buried in the southwest desert. Gary is looking for his brother a soldier and along the way makes acquaintances with Jody, james and Alana and they all set out on the trail of the brother and to get away from her father.",1423872000,2,670,4.283464566929134

8586662,4,B00CV1PHRW,Now this western is a Saturday afternoon movie it's a great leed up to say chyanne autum or a john sturges western it's good just doesn't have star pull but a real good movie,1402185600,2,174,4.147058823529412
8586663,3,B00CV1PHRW,The idea of having grown up children of movie stars is novel but about all that this movie has in originality. Good print emphasises the nice technicolour.,1388448000,,155,4.777777777777778
8586664,5,B00CV1PHRW,"This is a moderately entertaining late Western, with children of several significant stars of Western films taking prominent roles. Chill Wills is a stand out, and the DVD is worth getting just for him. Did he ever do anything that was fascinating and entertaining?",1385510400,2,265,5.045454545454546
