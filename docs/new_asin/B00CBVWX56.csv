8580040,2,B00CBVWX56,"This movie is basically someone's college visual arts project. Three hours of video footage with no narrative, and long sequences with no audio at all.

If you grew up in Romania, its an interesting look into the past. But it is not a ""documentary"" in any meaningful sense, and makes no attempt to be informative. If you are simply curious about the history of Romanian communism, you won't learn much here.

If someone thoughtful cut this down to 45 minutes, and added some narration with insight, it would be a great watchable video that I would love to show to students.",1419033600,2,573,4.663366336633663

8580042,5,B00CBVWX56,the idea is so original. The editing is masterful! Poor Nicolae is hung on his own Petard. The lady was a horror.,1390176000,,113,4.181818181818182
8580043,5,B00CBVWX56,"This is the best documentary movie about ""Ceausescu era"" I've ever seen. I lived 21 years of that period and I can promise you that the movie reflects very accurate what I witnessed",1384041600,5,181,4.515151515151516
8580044,3,B00CBVWX56,"This is an extremely long 3-hour subtitled documentary that is, quite frankly, exhausting to watch.  The problem being that the film is redundant in many ways--with an unending stretch of propaganda parades, adoring crowds, political speeches, visiting dignitaries, parliamentary proceedings, etc.  Most disappointing is the absence of Ceausescu's final speech and harangue--an historic event that turned the crowd and the country against him.  Crucial battle scenes and execution details are also omitted.  Looking back,  the most exciting depiction was that of a rebellious Party member who dared to criticize Ceausescu in front of a huge Party Congress.  In general, you may want to play this film at fast-forward speed to get to the scenes that interest you the most.",1373414400,3,771,5.436974789915967
