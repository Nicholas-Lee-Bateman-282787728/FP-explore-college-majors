1722463,5,B0000687D7,"Not since Lok Groundrunner found out Dark Helmet was his mother has one of these Oedekerk inspired films made me laugh so much. Bat Thumb is all about Wuce Bane's pursuit of GAAAThumbs evil doer, NO FACE! With his gender bending sidekick Blue Jay and drunk butler Fred. Bat Thumb tries to save the citizens of his fair city from having there faces removed. While looking good for the ladies. If you liked Thumb Wars and are a Bat Man fan (Movie or T.V.) this is a must for you DVD collection...",1026259200,4,494,4.380434782608695
1722464,5,B0000687D7,"The Bat Thumb feature is only about 30 minutes, but it's packed full of silliness. I think it's good that the feature is so short because otherwise the joke might wear off, but it's perfect at this length. To fully appreciate this DVD, however, you MUST watch the extras. The behind-the-scenes and interviews with the characters are just as hilarious as the movie. I also have Thumb Wars, and I think the Bat Thumb DVD is better because of the extras.",1161216000,,451,4.580246913580247
1722465,4,B0000687D7,not as funny  as thumb wars but easily a close second.  good stuff.,1139097600,,67,4.076923076923077
1722466,5,B0000687D7,This movie is hilarious and the best thumb movie i've seen. The people that don't get it are people who aren't to bright they like average humor but if you have an I.Q. of at least 50 and like off beat humor then you will enjoy this great thumb movie.,1139011200,,251,4.04
1722467,5,B0000687D7,This is by far one of the funniest movies in the thumb series.,1128211200,2,62,3.8461538461538463
1722468,1,B0000687D7,"What a waste of time! Boring, Boring, Boring! Incredibly unfunny jokes throughout. After Thumb Wars, I thought that these would all be hilarious- not so. Stay away from this one. Get Thumb Wars or Thumbtanic instead.",1111449600,2,216,5.027777777777778
1722469,5,B0000687D7,"You have to buy this absolutly Hilarious movie!!!
My favorite part is when....never mind.
anyway,it's about a guy and he's well,bat thumb,
he battles another evil thumb called ""NO FACE""!!!!!
His evil plan is to De-Face everyone in Gaaaaathumb city!!!
Will Bat-thumb and his stupid side-kick Bluejay Save the day?(NO)
sincerly,
  kenny",1069459200,,334,5.403846153846154
1722470,5,B0000687D7,"When my family went to Italy, and we spent the whole trip quoting Batthumb, we realized that the more you think about this movie, the funnier it gets.  We have told all our friends about it.  This is by far the best thumb movie, and I have seen them all except for the Blair Thumb.  We think there should be a Robin Thumb (Robin Hood) movie next!!",1061942400,,347,4.149253731343284
1722471,5,B0000687D7,This is the best out of all Thumb movies! It is so hilarious and brilliant you will watch it every night of your entire life. Wruce Bayne is Bat Thumb and he face's No face. Bat Thumb is not alone although he'll wish he was. He's got his partner Blue Jay to help him on his questy thingy. I hope you enjoy!,1060041600,,306,3.9516129032258065
1722472,4,B0000687D7,"Yet another ""Thumb"" film. Bat Thumb was stop ""No Face"" from erasing people's faces. He is assisted by the meddlesome & whiny Blue Jay. The best scene is the commissioner & the police chief sitting around & doing nothing until Bat Thumb shows up...just like the old Batman TV show.",1052006400,,280,4.62
1722474,5,B0000687D7,By far the best in a long line of funny spoofs by Steve Odekerk.  Truly hillarious.  Anyone who is a fan of batman will love it.  Every one of us knows a certain somebody like blue jay (watch the movie and you'll get it) so that adds to the enjoyment.  A definate must own.  Also check out other Thumb movies for a few good laughs,1042070400,,330,4.015384615384615
1722475,4,B0000687D7,"Ok, Gothumb city and this movie are a bit weak. I think Steve could have done a bit more than he did with this spoof. It is still funny, but out of his first 4 Thumb movies... this is the 4th place flick of the bunch. It is still entertaining, but don't get your hopes too high up there.",1034553600,,287,3.8813559322033897
1722476,4,B0000687D7,"Although none of the Thumb movies have surpassed the first in the series, Thumb Wars, they are all worth watching.
Steve Oedekerk is incredibly funny and quite bizzare sometimes, and each Thumb movie needs to be seen by everyone.
Bat Thumb is a good spoof of both the older Bat Man series and also the Bat Man movies.
If you've never seen a Thumb movie, start with ThumbWars, then the Blair Thumb.  Thumbtanic is pretty fun, and so now is Bat Thumb.  If you're already a Thumb fan, then you want this one for your collection.",1033344000,,525,4.458333333333333
1722477,5,B0000687D7,"This has gotten some second-tier reviews in comparison with the brilliant ""Thumb Wars"", but I enjoyed it very much in its own right. Taking off from both Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and the TV version, this is hilarious stuff, and fans of Steve Oedekerk's other ""Thumb"" gems will want to own them all. Funny additonal feature : ""cast interviews"".",1032220800,2,340,4.879310344827586
1722478,4,B0000687D7,"Bat Thumb is a clever little short that makes me laugh. It has humor, sarcasm, wit and innuendos that are not always for children. (But the kids will love it.) They are actually Thumbs that have faces that will be superimposed on them.
It actually parodies the Tim Burton version of Batman (with Michael Keaton) and duplicates scenes and situations that are all twisted and almost ... at times. The story is Bat Thumb gets a new partner - not by choice - Blue Jay (not Robin) and has to defeat the evil `No Face' (a thumb with no face on it!)
Steve Oedekerk (Best known for the Ace Ventura films, Jimmy Neutron, The Nutty Professor and recently Kung Pao.) is the writer, producer and creator of several of these O Entertainment productions - including Thumtanic, Thumb Wars and The Blair Thumb Project. He is slapstick and sarcastic in nature and these Thumbs have personality and an almost weird charm about them.
This is funny, short and they are technically well done. The art direction, special effects and even the music - which I thing is clearly superior - all make this adventure fun and exciting. To those who like oddball humor this is a must DVD to own. The extras include hysterical commentaries, outtakes, previews and storyboards. Get This DVD. (8-13-02)",1029196800,,1268,4.716216216216216
1722479,4,B0000687D7,"Your right BlueJay, if you don't like this one, ""Your In, Your Ins.., Your Insane!!""",1028764800,,84,4.666666666666667
1722480,5,B0000687D7,"This DVD is excellent! After seeing The Blair Thumb and Thumb Wars, Bat Thumb is by far the best in the series. The gags are great, the characters are hilarious, and Bat Thumb is just so damn cute. But to really appreciate this DVD you MUST watch the extra features, especially the cast interviews... they're the best part. if you love Steve Oedekerk's work or want a good laugh, Bat Thumb is definitely worth the ten bucks. enjoy!",1028332800,,431,4.538461538461538
1722481,2,B0000687D7,"A very unfunny short and so far the worst in the series. There a few laughs, but not nearly enough to sustain watching the whole thing.
The DVD includes: An ok commentary, mock behind-the-scenes footage and interviews, deleted scenes, storyboards, and trailers for all the Thumb films including the unreleased Frankenthumb and The Godthumb.
This is the best DVD in the series for sheer number of extras, but the movie [is bad].",1027555200,,427,4.944444444444445

7963715,1,B0000687D7,Not for kids.  The language and humor (it is not funny) is not for young fans of BatMan.  Didn't know what I was getting here.  Be careful not to watch around kids.,1383350400,,164,4.0625
