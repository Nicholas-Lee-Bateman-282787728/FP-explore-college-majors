5666498,5,B00BQK4Y0A,There's nothing surprising here. The familiar story of artists who are drawn into a maze of deceit and exploitation only to find themselves on the outside looking in and badly in debt. The interesting twist is how individuals tried to market themselves in false names to the degree that they actually believed in the deceptions! Very well crafted and amazingly revealing! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,1374451200,8,391,5.222222222222222
5666499,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"This excellent documentary tells the story of the world famous Sugar Hill Gang. Unfortunately, it is not a story full of happy parts but instead more of a cautionary tale of how the group members were ripped off by their former record company, Sugar Hill Records via shady business practices. However, two of the original rappers of the Sugar Hill Gang, Wonder Mike and Master Gee, seemed to have worked tirelessly to reverse their fortunes. I highly recommend this documentary!",1374364800,,478,4.9875
5666500,5,B00BQK4Y0A,I Found out things I did not about the SugarHill Gang. I hope this Doc. Gets seen by a lot of up coming Men & Women in The Music World,1373932800,,134,3.5
5666501,5,B00BQK4Y0A,I chose this rating because I thought the movie was excellent.  I liked it because it gave a voice to the underdog and it highlighted points-of-view from the top dog.  I recommend this movie for everyone who is interested in hip-hop history and music history in general.,1371340800,2,270,4.723404255319149
5666502,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"Great documentary about the history & backstory of Silvia Robinson, Sugar Hill Records, the Sugar Hill Gang and their groundbreaking hit 'Rappers Delight'.

5666506,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"man this movie was great i have watched it 3 times! this documentary was filmied over a many years so you see them evolve from like 2009 to 2013.
so the only thing i really don't like is it doesnt get as in depth about their music as i would like but hey what can you say it really inst about their musical upbringing its actually a movie about their name so that fans can find them.
the other thing i want to say about this dvd and wondermike master gee and big hen is that they need to come out with ANOTHER ONE cuz im loving it!",1421107200,2,531,3.925925925925926
5666507,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. It gave me a lot more insight into the music industry, it's manipulation and greed. I hope it works out for Mike and Guy as they struggle to get back what rightfully belongs to them. My heart goes out to them. I was glad to hear that Mike prays....I believe he will get great results through prayer.",1419033600,,338,4.467741935483871

5666509,3,B00BQK4Y0A,"The documentary was very informative detailing another unfortunate example of artist being exploited by a record company. The quality of the video wasn't the best with much of the written portion of the video being too wide for the camera lens, which made it hard to read what was being conveyed.",1416182400,,296,4.823529411764706
5666510,5,B00BQK4Y0A,Excellent documentary everyone should see it. Never knew Sugar Hill Records were such crooks. Thank God most are dead now Joe Sr. Sylvia and Joey. They will get their due. Karma is a bitch!,1415750400,,189,4.588235294117647
5666511,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"Surprised by the behind the scenes fighting, deceit and corruption. Changed my opinion of Sylvia Robinson, I'll leave it at that. How can you appropriate someone else's work as your own just for the money? Those of us that know who the Sugarhill Gang were and are, know better. The judge in the case half-assed the decision and while they were able to recoup their individual names, they still got robbed.",1414368000,,405,4.71830985915493

5666524,4,B00BQK4Y0A,"I enjoyed the DVD, but its the same old scam that the entertainment industry always seems to pull on young talent that hasn't learned the financial end of the game, you hate to see this happen but there is an old saying that goes don't run around with your nose all snotty, if you don't know something you ought to ask somebody. I was glad to see them not give up, and they kept on till they got their names , but they also took the song GOOD TIMES without permission. A good DVD on what not to do in the recording industry",1399248000,,523,4.087378640776699
5666525,5,B00BQK4Y0A,Interesting and insightful story about pioneers of the music industry.  Sad to think of what this group went through while having sold millions of records while their managers and record company execs became multi-millionaires.  Hope they tour in my area one day.,1397260800,,263,5.238095238095238
5666526,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"I enjoyed purchasing this item due to the fact I grew up with ""Master Gee"" and ""Wonder Mike"" and others  in the film. It was sad to see how money corrupts the best of relationships and even from the sandbox. It is a very important film especially for aspiring musicians and actors and anyone else involved in the entertainment business. A textbook case of concentrating on the ""show"" and not the ""business"" of show business. Always retain the best entertainment lawyer you can prior to signing any contracts no matter how desperate your current situation is financially.",1391904000,,570,4.876288659793815
5666527,4,B00BQK4Y0A,Watched this movie with my husband who is a huge hip hop/music fan.  I was a little resistant but ended up enjoying the information presented as well as the filming.  Good documentary!,1389052800,,184,4.71875
5666528,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"I'm from Englewood, NJ and grew up knowing all of the people in this movie. I lived 1 block away from the studio. It tells a side I never knew. I advise everyone who loves Hip Hop to check it out!",1384905600,,196,3.8048780487804876
5666529,4,B00BQK4Y0A,"I was hip to some of the things mentioned in the documentary, like musicians calling home needing cash because they hadn't gotten paid, but getting the full story straight from the headliners Master Gee and Wonder Mike of how they were treated and their struggle to regain their brand, their ability to make a living, their names...priceless!",1382572800,2,342,5.017543859649122

5666531,5,B00BQK4Y0A,"I never knew Sugar Hill records was this devious. I grew up on this music and as a DJ during this era the Sugar Hill label had major respect. When we saw a new record in that blue sleeve with the trademark Sugar Hill signature, we would buy the records on site without even hearing them first. Wow...eye opening story.",1374969600,,318,4.316666666666666
8572611,5,B00BQK4Y0A,This shows the inner workings fans aren't privy to. What was done to these young artists and still can and does happen today is atrocious. Keep your eyes open - they're still performing and coming back!! Karma prevails.,1517529600,,219,4.7894736842105265

8572615,4,B00BQK4Y0A,"Informative and revealing documentary about the inner-workings of the music business as experienced by rap pioneers, the Sugarhill Gang. It's unfortunate what happened to Wonder Mike and Master Gee, and shameful that the legal system did not, or does not, have enough common sense to do the right thing. It's nearly unbelievable to watch what happened to this group, especially the shenanigans their label (and label owners) pulled. It'll make you shake your head in disgust! The production value seems less than high-budget, and it could benefit from some editing. But overall, these minor points do not take away from the overall impact. One lesson to take away from this project is to not go into this business without knowing how the system works - regardless of the genre of music.  Much of what happened is - with a good attorney and some understanding of the ""biz"" - preventable. Any person who desires to be in the music business should watch this documentary. I also highly recommend ""20 Feet From Stardom.""",1497052800,,1016,4.941520467836257

8572618,5,B00BQK4Y0A,Sad but true story of greed in the record industry. The sad truth is the group never came close to realizing their artistic potential because they had no idea how to run their business.,1463270400,,185,4.470588235294118

8572620,5,B00BQK4Y0A,A film that needs to be seen by all who call themselves music fans and disciples of hip hop. They were our first and that can not be replaced,1443484800,,141,3.896551724137931
