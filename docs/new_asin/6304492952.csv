7873233,5,6304492952,"I had all the Disney sing-along tapes when my son was little. He loved them and sang along with them. Then one day my mother gave them away to her girlfriends kids which made me very upset. Now I am trying to replace them for my two little granddaughters. I ordered the sing along songs, the early years at it came sooner than I expected and I am very pleased. I hope to have all of them before the end of the year. Thank you Karin",1498262400,,431,4.023255813953488
