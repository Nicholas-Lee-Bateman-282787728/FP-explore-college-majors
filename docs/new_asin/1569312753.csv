7797137,5,1569312753,"This has to be one of my favorite ones from the Hard Battle series because the 2 episodes on this one are funny as hell and they never get old.
1st Episode, ""Sneeze Me, Squeeze Me"" Shampoo makes lunch for Ranma and it's delicious Dim Sum but she neglets to tell him that she put in a mushroom that with a simple command (like snapping your fingers or clapping) makes whoever ate the mushroom respond to that command. Shampoo figures this will be a great way to get Ranma to hug her and she tries snapping her fingers at the same time a cat sneezes and it turns out that the command is now a sneeze! Now Ranma has to avoid Shampoo to dave his pride and also watch for an angry and ill Akane!
Episode 2, ""Rub a Dub Dub, There's a Pervert in the Tub"", Akane and her friends plan a weekend to a nice hot spring resort and as always, Happosai wants to go with. After Ranma, Genma and Soun spoil his plans and break his bath bucket, the Master is furious and decides to unleash his deadliest tactic ""The Happo Fire Burn""... but he forgot how to do it because it had been so long. However he remembers where he hid the scroll to do the technique! Now it's up to the boys to bear Happy to scroll and destroy the technique before he can use it on them.
Like I said, this one is just plain out funny and I would be willing to put this to the test and say that this is one of the best tapes in the Hard Battle series. It's down right funny and it never gets old at all. Check out DIM SUM DARLING and also check out these tapes: DHARMA CHAMELEON, MELONCHOLY BABY and ONCE UPON A TIME IN JUSENKYO.",1046304000,,1584,4.080128205128205
7797138,5,1569312753,"This is an episode about Shampoo making some Dim Sum. The Delivery service guy comes with some noodles, and Colonge has a spell to make him sleep. Colonge gives him the Dim Sum, and he says he can't eat on the job. They say it's between him and them. Eat starts eating it, and Colonge snaps, and says sleep. The guy falls off the chair, and sleeps! Now that Shampoo knows, she's going to make some Dim Sum for Ranma. So if he eats it, and Shampoo sneezes,Ranma will hug her, if he wants to or not. And Ranma doesn't hug just Shampoo, but other people that are around him, and sneeze!!!!!",970358400,,587,4.25
7797139,4,1569312753,"Two episodes from the TV Hard battle Series
(1) Dim Sum Darling: Shampoo  attempts to combine magic with her cooking skills to force Ranma to fall in  love with her.  Things become complicated when the spell inadvertently  involves Akane.
(2)Rub-A-Dub-Dub! There's A Pervert In The Tub!: This  episode features Happosai's perversion, otaku delight.
This volume is another one to round out a collection.  The first episode  is wonderful with all the food references and silly situations while the  2nd episode provides ample opportunities for fan service which are not  wasted.  Probably one of the better TV series volumes.",962323200,,623,5.26530612244898
7797140,5,1569312753,Shamapoo has another crafty plan!  This time it's to hypnotize Ranma with a new recipe.  The bad twist is that now whenever Ranma hears someone sneeze he throws himself into the arms of whosever nearby.  What will  happen when Akane comes down with a cold?  This movie is one of the more  interesting Ranma movies!  The creative plot is just the begining.  I gave  it 5 stars and highly recomend it.,960681600,2,399,4.507042253521127
