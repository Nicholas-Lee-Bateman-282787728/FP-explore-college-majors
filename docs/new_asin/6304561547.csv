900923,4,6304561547,"This is a pretty good movie, and a pretty good disaster movie, and suffers chiefly in comparison with Armageddon and Deep Impact, which had the advantages of higher budgets and vastly advanced special effects. For its  time, though, it is pretty good!
As is the case with most of the disaster  genre of film, the story focuses on a few individuals, families with  victims in the main disaster zones. The movie spends as much time following  them and their interrelationships as it does on the disasters.
The  Asteroid chunks come in two main clusters, the first of which is a virtual  non-event (a dam is burst, and sections of Kansas City are flooded). But  the second asteroid-fall is a doozy, demolishing most of Dallas with some  reasonable special effects and some very well done rubble.
As is so  often the case with disaster films, though, the movie misses out on wider  aspects of the disaster. We here cursory reports of a Peruvian apartment  building and what not which are impacted, but the movie concentrates  exclusively on events in Missouri, Colorado, and ultimately Texas. By  anything the movie shows, the disaster is local rather than worldwide in  impact. A broader view would definitely increase its  effectiveness.
Still, recommended for watching, particularly if you like  the genre.",952473600,7,1305,5.0

Now......THE BAD NEWS: They offer this DVD up as a Region 2 DVD in a Region 1 area, what are you people, stupid or something? Not all of us have Region 2 players, so respectfully, quit offering Region 2 discs in areas that are NOT Region 2.
Next: They chopped up a 4 hour Mini Series into a two hour movie, if you're going to offer up a movie that was once a two part Mini-Series, offer it up that way, they did it with Asteroid (2008) and Impact (2008) so I really don't know what the problem is with this movie.

So, as a former editor of television news, what do you do, you edit it for a two hour release print.  It ran over two nights and was filled with secondary story lines to make it a two parter.

The special effects are well played, I am a Michael Biehn fan and always appreciated his work.  Finally, anytime you edit, you either lose it altogether or you shorten the scenes.  I have seen both versions and am okay with both.

Sure the special effects were a lot closer to corny than convincing, but I still found the movie to be fun.
I've wanted this film on DVD for a long time.  When I saw the price being asked for a NTSC version at $128,
I had to laugh.  I hope no one was uniformed enough to pay such a ridiculous price. It's simple to covert
a PAL DVD to a NTSC format (and change the region code at the same time). I use ""ifoedit"" (freeware) but there
are several other programs available that will make the conversions. Within 45 minutes of getting the DVD out
of my mailbox, I had copied it to my hard drive, converted it to region free NTSC, and burned it to a
dual-layer DVD.  Instead of tossing out the original disk as I had planned, I decided to keep it as a back-up,
just in case I need to make a new disk.

901352,5,6304561547,"this movie, I believe when it aired, was on NBC as a 2-hour special dealing with an asteroid which was on a collision course with our planet Earth.  I also believe that the reason the movie came out when it did was because there was an actual incident where an asteroid or small planetoid, out in space would have come close to bombarding our planet and causing some major citywide panic.

901426,5,6304561547,"I've watched this several times during the past few years, and when I finally decided to buy it, ordering it on DVD was way out of the question. Why buy a movie on DVD for more than 30 bucks when you can get the same thing on VHS for just a fraction of the cost?
Needless to say, the movie arrived in good condition and I was glad I saved my money by going with the VHS. The story of the movie is easy to follow along and the characters did a great job. The story focuses on a 29-year old female astronomer and her young son, her father, who is a doctor in Dallas, Texas, a Kansas City fireman and his family, a married couple that are both doctors, and the new head of FEMA who isn't afraid to plunge himself into a disastrous situation to save lives, starting with the beginning of the movie when an asteroid fragment hits communities outside Billings, Montana, blowing up a semi-truck in the process of it's detonation. Houses are on fire and the cocky FEMA guy in a helicopter lands in the middle of it, saving an elderly woman and her husband, who was trying to water down his roof, even though his house was already engulfed in flames, right before their exposed propane tank explodes.
The female astronomer is busy with the expected arrival of the ""Fletcher"" comet over the 4th of July weekend, which is to miss the Earth by about a million miles. Unfortunately, it's trip through the asteroid field has brought a couple of straggling unwanted guests--two asteroids heading right for Earth, and both of them big enough to do significant damage. The smaller asteroid, detected by just two days from it's impact with Earth, seems to be on it's way to put a smoking crater into the ground where the metro area of Kansas City just happens to be, and the U.S. government now has it's hands full trying to evacuate 2 million people in less than two days from the Kansas City area.
The people are evacuated just in time, but the FEMA guy then risks death by going out in his pickup truck to rescue two Kansas City firemen, who had their truck disabled by the speeding car of a drunk driver---the only person happening to still be left in the city. The smaller asteroid breaks up on it's entry through the atmosphere, leaving only a small fragment to smash into the side of a local dam and dumping a 2-story high tidal wave of water out of the reservoir. The FEMA guy manages to outgun the wave, which floods parts of the abandoned city before emptying into the river.

But the somewhat-bigger asteroid poses as the worst threat, it's impact with Earth expected to kill millions of people and blocking out the sun for a matter of years. With the female astronomer and the FEMA guy at Space Command, punching in the coordinates of the asteroid, three separate military jets take off, all of them equipped with a highly-powered laser beam to destroy the big hunk of rock by shooting off the beam in all separate directions. The Air Force jet taking off from Florida is forced to abort due to equipment malfunction sustained by flying through hurricane winds, leaving just two jets to destroy the asteroid, and somehow, their two lasers manage to pull it off.

A sense of relief and normalcy grips the nation once more, and the astronomer invites her FEMA friend to Dallas, to visit her father and her son, who was staying with his grandpa during the crisis. But it isn't long before word gets out that the asteroid is not completely destroyed, but has broken off into thousands of smaller chunks all heading for Earth. Both main characters leave Dallas to take in the situation, but little can be done except to track the pieces as they appear. One piece of rock 80 meters wide is tracked to be heading somewhere for Texas before they lose track of it's approach. The astronomer desperately tries to get ahold of her father and son in the few minutes remaining before impact, but with little success.

The rock breaks up upon entry through the atmosphere, and you clearly see about half a dozen chunks of it all hitting around the suburbs and the downtown Dallas area. The entire downtown area takes one hit, and appears to wither and vaporize. The suburbs are badly wrecked, little of it still standing, and even the good doctor's house was blown out from under him while he and his grandson crouch under a table in the basement. The astronomer then hitches a ride to the evacuation center at nearby Fort Worth, and is determined to go into the wreckage of Dallas to find her family. Good timing too. While overlooking the ruins of his destroyed hospital, the ground caves in and the doctor falls down the hole, fracturing both his legs and going into shock. Trying to find some help for his grandpa, the boy wanders off, and appears to get lost in the process.

The FEMA guy then comes into Dallas to help out with the chaos. The astronomer finds her father inside the hole and while a volunteer firefighting crew from Kansas City arrive to get him out, she presses on with one of the firemen to find her son and they see that he's clinging to the structure of a sublevel building wedged down halfway inside the impact crater of what used to be downtown Dallas. How and why the boy happened to be down there is a mystery, but the unstable ground won't hold the building for long and for what seems to be the tenth time, the FEMA guy puts his life at risk, plunging down into the crater to rescue the boy.
""Elliot, I need your help."" he says.
""Why?"" the confused boy asks.
""Because if I don't get you out of this crater, your mother is going to kill me.""
But everything works okay in the end, and while they all watch the approach of the ""Fletcher"" comet the next day on it's ""bullet-burn"", you hear this one TV reporter come out with one of those very cheesy remarks about how ""in the midst of such destruction and death, there is hope for new life in the process."" PUH-LEASE! Anywhere from 30,000 to 50,000 people have died in Texas, over 100,000 are badly-injured, one FEMA guy had been shot to death by an angry father who had lost his son, and I'm sure that's the LAST thing people expect to hear from newspeople who had been sitting all comfy in their chairs in front of a news camera. But it was a good plot, and I still have to give out 5 stars for it. Kudos!",1295395200,2,6265,4.454703832752613
901427,2,6304561547,"Asteroid (1997) is a mildly entertaining, kind of predictable tale, involving Earth being threatened by the potential impact of asteroids.  The TV movie, which preceded the release of Deep Impact (1998) and Armageddon (1998), has some similarities to both films.

Dr. Lily McKee (Annabelle Sciorra), an astronomer at the National Observatory in Colorado, is tracking two large asteroids, trying to predict what threat they may pose.  She coordinates with FEMA director Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn), to try and minimize damages, while FEMA prepares to provide aid to those affected by the crisis.  The first asteroid strikes near Kansas City, unleashing some flood waters, but there is no cataclysmic damage.

As luck would have it, the second larger asteroid is also projected to strike the Earth.  Because of the asteroid's large mass, the resulting dust cloud is projected to cause the death of most living creatures on the planet.  The US uses a laser weapon to try and destroy the asteroid, but is only partially successful, as the main mass is fragmented, and the fragments are still projected to strike the Earth.  Terra just can't catch a break!

For safety, McKee sends her son to stay with her father Dr. Charles Napier (Anthony Zerbe), who lives in Texas.  Unfortunately, as the planet is hit by showers of asteroid debris, Napier's house is destroyed, leading to a hazardous search and rescue mission, featuring McKee and Wallach, wandering through fiery rubble, and unstable ground.

Asteroid, features some Emmy winning special effects, and some mildly intriguing situations, including the evacuation of a huge metropolitan area.  The silly story, curses the planet with incredible bad luck.  And as the focus locks in on McKee's personal drama, whatever faint credibility that remains, drains away, dragging things down into a sloggy. improbable, melodrama.

As this disastrous effort is no longer available new, your least costly alternative may be to look for it on SyFy.",1273622400,,1987,5.2271293375394325

901433,2,6304561547,"You've heard the story before.  An asteroid is on a direct path with earth.  Cue ball meets eight ball.  People are going crazy, chaos reigns supreme, and only a select few can be saved.

It's a shame Michael Biehn has this blemish on his career.  He was in Terminator and Navy Seals for goodness sakes!  In this flop, however, he's paired with an unsatisfying collection of B-level flunkees and ""that guy"" actors.  And the asteroid ""special effects"", whoa, they look like a really bad film scene from a first generation video game that didn't sell very well.

Aside from the completely preposterous asteroid scenes, the destruction of the city as a result of an asteroid-on-dam collision is completely pathetic and laughable in every way possible.  The ""city"" is clearly a model set, and there is absolutely no attempt to disguise this fact.  I felt like I was watching a child's toys being destroyed by an overzealous parent watering the lawn.

There's nearly nothing likable, enjoyable, or believable in the entire movie.  Watch it if you want to make fun of it, or if you want to see how a bad movie is made.  On a side note, for such a craptastic movie, the film's length makes it similar to a root canal without anesthesia.",1204848000,,1229,4.686915887850467
901434,4,6304561547,I enjoyed this movie.  I enjoy most movies with Annabella Sciorra.  She plays an important scientist in this story about a threating Asteroid.  If nothing else the movie should remind us of the need to know more.  What will we do if this actually happens.  We are not as prepared as we should be.,1188691200,,296,4.407407407407407

Once you get past the special affects, all which use cheesy models, this godforsaken movie is boring as sin, or, should I say mud!

Beside being preposterous, for example, the meteoroid, or whatever, ONLY hits a dam in its first strike, this pitiful film is also delusional! Remember the scene where the head of FEMA risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire. As Hurricane Katrinia proves, there is no such thing as a bureaucratic, administrator hero! Instead, this movie comes off as a piece of not-so-subtle Federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time!",1135641600,7,892,4.823529411764706

They could of done a much better job especially with the water scenes in Kansas City.  However, the big part that I hate was the removal of parts on the DVD versus the television production of the same movie.  Usually you get extras on a DVD but this one removed portions.  I would assume that was done to restrict it to 2 hours but some of the scenes removed actually made the movie better. In addition, even though I can't really prove it, it looks like the editors of this DVD sped up the movie.  If they just left the movie exactly the way it was when it played on NBC (I believe) or added additional scenes cut from the original movie, it would of made this one DVD purchase much more worth the money.  I would recommend renting it versus buying it.",1131667200,16,932,4.291428571428572

Worth the money and time to see it. Characters were developed and you knew who they were and what purpose they served.  Good plot, even kept the interest of my grandchildren.  Can't find too many directors or producers that can make an interesting plot and keep it moving.  Dr. Lily McKee played by Annabelle Sciorra discovers a massive asteriod hurtling towards the earth and tries to get Feds to help and believe her. She notifies FEMA in comes Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn) he plays his role well -- better than Annablle Sciorra, sometimes she looks like she is confused...but carries her role well.

I was really dissapointed, though. Several minutes of the TV version were cut, for some reason. Many DVDs add scenes to the movie, so this is inexplicable. Those were hilariously bad scenes, too. I don't know what they were thinking.
The DVD also doesn't have any extras, hence the 2 stars.

FACT: Michael Biehn is like Kurt Russell and Kiefer Sutherland, a good actor who hasn't quite got the right role yet.
FACT;  Annabella Sciorra is so lethargic, one can doubt she's feeling anything at all.

901580,3,6304561547,"Yes, it's no Deep Impact or Armeggedon. The only similiarity is the asteroid. And if were not for two little things, this would've been a four star movie. First, there is a water-crashing-over-land scene that is reminiscent of the old days (the 60's) when we saw frothy bathwater being tossed over miniature model towns. It's an eyesore in the movie and that's when you start to notice the acting aint all that great either. There are alot of really good effects mixed in though, which is puzzling. There is no spaceship that attempts to make a landing on the asteroid, and their defensive ideas all revolve around lasers instead of nukes. There is a movie here, but they mixed in some pretty bad effects with the good ones and spent too much TIME focusing on the drama of the doctor's lost child and the grandpa. You know what happens, she spends at least a half hour of the movie looking through a wasteland, and then there's another 30 minutes spent on totally irrelevant action sequences while rescuing a boy from his own stupidity (he wanders into an asteroid crater - that is on fire).
Reviewers seem to like this movie, and it wasn't all that bad. Deep Impact is one of my favorite movies, so I had to check this out. I can only watch Armeggedon if I'm alone and allowed to fast-forward through all the drama scenes. And Asteroid will never be watched twice - i.e. rent.",1047427200,39,1377,4.556451612903226

901583,5,6304561547,"If you know any science at all - and I mean even a tiny bit then this film is for you. It's been years since a film has demonstrated a complete lack of credibility scientifically. You know, if it was the ""Color Purple"" or something, that would be fine - but this IS a science-oriented film and it's hilariously bad. I nearly cried laughing at it. Some of the highlights:
A 4 mile asteroid is ""blowed-up"" (I can't say blown up, that's what adults would say) by two or three navy fighter airyplanes that have little laser beams (yes, it's ""laser beams"" - not just lasers) stuck on the front of them.. The laser beams started out at about 1/2 inch wide, travelled through the rest of the atmosphere and landed on the asteroid, practically covering it. Then it blowed-up.
Oh.. and the planes were flying at about 200.. Now if i remember rightly, in airyplaney-talk, they always say how many thousands of feet their at, so 200 is 200,000 feet.. So the planes (including an old tomcat - came off a carrier, don't you know) flew higher than a spy plane. Without falling out of the sky because there was no air or nothing..
Not only that, but the pilots have little asteroid shapes moving around in their HUD displays (just like tie-fighters in star wars) They eventually get ""lock"" on the four mile object that's hundreds of thousands of miles from earth.. grin.. wow I was wretching with giggles at that point...
The bits keep hitting America mostly too, oh and Canada (for variety?)
One asteroidy bit hit a funfair park and exploded over it as a small firework display. Lot of confusion and screaming, probably by the actors to let them out of the plot..

One aspect of this failure of a movie has been overlooked, and that is the unsuitability for children.  There was just too much of the one kid in peril.  That scene would give any kid nightmares.
By the way, I did see this on TV the first time around, and I do think it was a bit more enjoyable...there were commercial breaks and quite a few of the commercials were more entertaining than the movie.
