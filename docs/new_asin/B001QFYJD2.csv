8603705,1,B001QFYJD2,"i was really enjoying this until I got to about the 40-minute mark. Then the video artifacted out and the disc started skipping on my PS4. I took the disc out and checked it. While it was a burned DVD-R (the blue gives it away), there were no marks or imperfections on the disc. Tried it again on my PS3, and noticed if I tried to chapter skip to where I was it would lock up. The DVD seemed to be data damaged. I'm ordering a replacement, and if the replacement works I would definitely give this a higher rating. As it is, it simply doesn't work.",1425254400,,548,4.130841121495327
