I bought this DVD as a tool to help me with my report and I am happy I did. The films of Martin Luther King are a wealth of information. Even better was the way it shows you how Germans duing World War II made racism a part of their culture, leading to the great war. It made me think differently about the racism I encounter in my daily life and provided me with a good perspective and quotes for my paper. Five stars!",1148428800,,522,3.980952380952381
8159707,5,B0009RS0AG,"America is a unique country because it was made up of people that came from nearly every other country in the world who had to find a way to assimilate and work together.

Obviously that effort sometimes worked better than others. The clips on these DVDs show different types of people from different parts of the world stuggling to become part of the culture and then ultimately succedding.

Some of the clips are better than others. The strongest films deal with black and white racism in America, but there are also good clips about easter europe people having problems.

It's a good anthropolgoy lesson overall.",1146614400,,615,4.838095238095238
