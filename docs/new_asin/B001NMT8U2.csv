8327411,1,B001NMT8U2,What a rip-0ff- To PAY to see an infomercial? Is there some way to get my money back?  I can't believe Amazon is actually charging for this!,1376784000,4,140,4.185185185185185
8327412,2,B001NMT8U2,"when i ordered this i was expecting to watch a cooking show done in raw foods style. What you get is a infomercial styled thirty minute program all about selling you his book,dvd,and ceramic knives. Yes,they did demonstrate four raw recipes, but in the context of trying to get you to buy his products. Basically this is less cooking show and more QVC styled infomercial to buy his stuff.",1362873600,10,388,4.63768115942029
8327413,2,B001NMT8U2,"There are only a few recipes on this and the commentator talks through all of them.
It is actually an infomercial for the ""Raw"" cook book.
Personally I liked ""Greens can save your life"" by Victoria Boutenko
which I ordered at the same time. It has so much more information.",1333065600,7,273,4.48
