story.  He was a strong character and his past and attitude were realistic. He had high expectations for
his son and you must watch the movie to see how the story unfolds.",1500336000,,277,4.2075471698113205

7820021,3,6302036801,"This is a pretty good Irish South Boston movie, it's captures the Irish father trying so hard for his America son. He wants his boy to be tough just like the way he was brought up but his boy isn't buying it.

Very good Irish/American movie and it was filmed when they were building number one Financial Center in South Station.
FYI I'm the singer at the funeral.

Who's your Daddy now!!!!!!!!",1397692800,2,393,4.444444444444445
