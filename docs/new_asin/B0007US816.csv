8501045,5,B0007US816,"I have seen only one of these two movies included on the DVD, ""Miracle in the Void"" and it was of such excellence and necessity as to be hair-raising.

The author is without question a genius operating across numerous fields of endeavor, having a PhD in physics, the first astronaut chosen for the NASA Mars mission as also adviser to American Government, pianist, and on and on goes the list.

Speaking with final authority, his movie makes an incisive summary assessment of the condition of this planet and the decisive tools we have of a physical and cognitive nature to bring about a magnificent world vision, that IN FACT COINCIDES WITH THE TELEOLOGY. You will probably recognize this as self-evident.

The other title may sound flighty, however once again, though i trust its validity based on a large documentation of similar materials, i have not seen that movie, and only urge upon myself and you to wait and be informed before judging anything. Our present technologies are fatally  obsolete, and surpassing new ones are *already implemented*.",1366502400,,1053,4.965909090909091
