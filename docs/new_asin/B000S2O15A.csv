2879113,5,B000S2O15A,"If you have a high-energy indoor cat who craves hours of play but you don't have hours to devote to him, Backyard Buffet will help you both sleep better at night. I pop it in when I am going out for 2 or 3 hours and when I get back he is relaxed and sleepy instead of keyed-up and instigating aggressive play with my hands and arms. I've been showing him this DVD for over 9 months and it's like he's seeing it for the first time every time.

My cat loves this DVD so much he will dash into the room whenever he hears me turn on the DVD player. He paws at the birds and squirrels on the screen and will jump up on top of the TV. I have a sturdy base on my flat screen but wiring it to the wall wouldn't be a bad idea if you have a big, energetic cat. Just seeing him get so excited and being engaged in play activity for such a long amount of time is so much fun to watch. It's entertainment for me too!

I also bought the Bird Land DVD but he had no interest in that. By some mysterious cat logic, Backyard Buffet really clicked for him. But cats' interests vary widely so maybe experiment with some YouTube clips before you buy the DVD.

It's tempting to draw the analogy of putting a toddler in front of the TV, but the glaring difference is that kids get bigger and can go outside and play and enjoy socialization and independence. Indoor cats rely totally on us for the physical, emotional and social aspects of their lives-- for their entire lives. It's been my experience that if you help meet a cat's need to kill things you will be rewarded with loyalty and affection. Just make sure you fortify your flat screen if you plan on buying this DVD.",1345852800,32,1653,4.127329192546584
2879114,5,B000S2O15A,"This DVD has eight sections:

- Sparrows: a hanging feeder over a tray, both full of birdseed; sparrows fly (and occasionally fade) in and out of the picture, landing on both the tray and the feeder.
- Degus: 2-3 degus (chinchilla-like rodents) crawling around on a few logs.
- Crickets: a straight-down shot of a table full of crickets that run across the TV screen.
- Squirrel Group: multiple squirrels running around the roots of a large tree.
- Martens: a nest in the corner just under a roof; 4-5 half-grown birds that remain in the nest are fed by an adult bird who flies in and out of the picture.
- Chinchilla: one chinchilla who runs and hops around on a small patch of lawn with a couple of stacked bricks to climb on.
- Squirrel: a single squirrel eating acorns and wandering around on a large patch of lawn.
- Mice: multiple mice crawling in and out of a loaf of bread in which holes have been cut.

The soundtrack for each section alternates between two recordings of birds, one cheeping/squawking and one chirping/singing, regardless of the animal that's actually on the screen, but I find it unobtrusive.  Each section is a chapter on the DVD so you can skip to a specific section, and the DVD does have a menu so you can start at whatever section you like.  The camera work is very good; the camera is kept still and focused on the action, and the distance from camera to subject(s) is appropriate for each section - far enough away to catch all the movement, but close enough so that the animals can be seen.

I have four cats and all four of them will watch this video with varying degrees of interest, ranging from ""watched it once, meh"" to completely obsessed.  The obsessed cat comes and checks out the TV fairly often to see if her video is on - she actually watched Larry the Cable Guy do stand-up for ten minutes before I took pity on her and turned on the DVD.  Each of my cats seems to have their favorite sections, with the martens and swallows being the big winners, and the mice being universally ignored.

The caveat: think about your TV before you get this video.  My cats have patted, scratched, and lunged full-force at my TV screen, and one of them climbed up on top of it, was unable to sustain her position, and slid slowly down the side of the TV, grabbing at the edge of the screen the whole time.  If you're doubtful about the durability of your screen, or if you have a free-standing TV that's top-heavy or easy to wobble/push over, you'll want to be careful.",1331769600,97,2499,4.42483660130719
2879115,5,B000S2O15A,"I inherited this from my gf. Over the past year my cat's become addicted to Youtube movies of squirrels and whatnot, so after her pet passed away she thought my pet might like this, as well. What can I say? She does indeed love this, especially the chinchillas and crickets.

(The ""episodes"" are close-ups of birds, jumping chinchilas, squirrels and gross crickets that look a BIT too much like roaches for my taste, lol, BUT so what: the cat loves them.)

I can play it on the TV or the computer, which is nice since she's getting tired of the same videos over and over that I find on Youtube. I suppose she'll eventually tire of this too, but the image is a lot crisper than most Youtube vids. Just thought these guys deserved a shout-out since I didn't see any reviews here.

----

Update:

Now I know why parents plop their kids in front of the TV for some peace of mind. When my poor cat wants to play and play play, some days when I just have too much work I put this on and she's transfixed and entertained for an hour or so, after which she falls asleep. Much easier than YouTubes that last only a few minutes (if that). Just have to gently move her away from the screen when she gets too close / excited, so she doesn't scratch it. Probably going to buy the sequel, and hope they're still making these!

But I felt they were upset when I got home after leaving it on the entire day when I was at work. They didn't greet me when I came home and seemed almost turned into themselves. Hard to explain. So I don't leave it on all day anymore. Now I have had it for a few months, and while my younger cat still finds it interesting, the older one is kind of immune to it. But even the younger cat doesn't interact it with as much. He just likes the company. I think having the DVD is worth it as a treat to put on every once in a while.

I live on the 7th floor of a condo building in Downtown Columbus.  There are NO trees or grass in the area.
At my older house there were always birds and rabbits and squirrels running past their windows.

I started searching the web for something to entertain them while i'm not around, and I found a posting where someone suggested the Backyard Buffet.  I searched it on Amazon, read the positive reviews,  and ordered the video.

The DVD arrived, and I popped it into the player.
When it started playing, the chirp of birds came out loudly through the TV Speaker.
One of my cats came racing from the other room to see what was going on and the other jumped up onto the TV Stand.
Both were memorized by the video.  One of my cats kept going behind the tv to try to get at the birds on the feeder.

My all-star alpha-type was mad playful as a kitty, but as the years passed, he gave it all up and basically went to bed. No interest in toys at all. In two weeks of 45-minute sessions every other day with this video, he has virtually turned into a kitten again. Not only is he stalking and smacking at the screen, but at other times he is ""flying"" after teasers he normally wouldn't have bothered to yawn at. My less-alpha alpha cat had a super first session with the video, but now watches more passively--but is engaged nonetheless. Likewise, he has taken renewed interest in playing with other cat toys. I plan to not overrely on this and will give it a rest as much as possible in favor of chase toys now that my guys are interested again.

This movie keeps both of them feeling like they are having an adventure. We have a patio door, and we put a bird feeder just feet away from the patio door so there is what we call BTV (Bird TV). The video plays, the window BTV ""plays"" and their senses go crazy with birds, bugs, squirrels, chinchillas, and mice! Both cats have a high quality life indoors because of this movie.

The Persian obviously heard the sound of birds chirping and squirrels scurrying, because she went into predator mode, climbed up to the top of the couch, and started scanning the room. After a minute or so, she noticed the activity on the screen, jumped down, ran over to the bookcase in which the TV is mounted, and started meowing and pawing at the screen.

2879192,5,B000S2O15A,"I noticed recently that my new cat, who I adopted to be a companion for my cat at home, (we had to put our oldest cat to sleep, and our remaining cat was clearly missing him months after he was gone).  The new cat is a rescue, so we're not sure how old he is ... the vet said probably a year to a year and a half.
One day while I was sitting on the couch using my laptop, I noticed that the new cat was very interested when I moved my mouse arrow around the computer screen.  Neither of my other cats have ever shown interest in what was going on either the TV or laptop screen.  So when I saw this DVD, I wondered if it was something my new little kitty would enjoy.  The answer is a resounding, ""YES!!""  He's absolutely fascinated by it, particularly the birds at the feeder and the crickets racing around the screen.  Sitting on the chair I put out for him in front of the TV apparently isn't close enough ... he sits right up on the ledge so he can be nose to nose with the TV screen.  He puts his paw on the screen in an attempt to catch the birds and bugs, (he's declawed so I don't mind ... though I don't think my husband would be amused!)
The biggest surprise was how my older cat reacted .... he got right up there, too!  He's a little smarter than the new guy ... after touching the screen once he realized he wasn't going to actually catch the bird, but he still stuck around to watch them.  My new cat is still trying to catch the bugs as I write this, (the video must automatically loop, because this is the 2nd time the bugs have been on).  Very amusing .... I'll definitely be buying an similar DVD, (if my husband doesn't see cat paws all over the TV, that is!)
Update on 8/14/15:  I have been at home more than usual over the past few weeks, and have been staying up much later than normal. And my young, energetic cats has been driving me CRAZY!!  I swear this cat does not have an, ""off button"" ... he is always on the move, and if he gets bored he starts pulling down papers and pens from my table, (he likes to chew paper - don't ask me why) and basically gets into everything I don't want him to get into.  I know it's not his ""fault"" ... I've never had a kitten before, (I'm praying he's still in the, ""kitten"" stage!!)  Both of my previous cats were already adults when I adopted them, so this endless energy is new to me.  I'm seriously praying he'll calm down at least a little as he ages!!
So I'm sitting here after 1am, and both of my kitties are definitely nocturnal and more active in the wee hours of the morning.  My young cat is once again driving me out of my mind, (I had already pulled out his favorite toy, ""Da Bird"" ... he will chase that feather on a string until he is LITERALLY panting ... and he'd continue chasing it if I didn't put it away!  Then I brought out his interactive toys one at a time, putting one away before putting the next one out, (I highly recommend any of the interactive toys from, ""SmartyKat"" - I have 4 of them and both cats enjoy all of them).  I played with him as he chased his motorized mouse in the kitchen, (thank you SmartyKat) and pushed a flashing ball back and forth on a track, which gets him running and pushing the ball as well. Throughout the night he dove and rolled around in his cat tunnel and had wrestling matches with my older cat.  You would think all that activity would at least slow him down, but you'd be wrong ... he also managed to get into things in the kitchen between games, (though not as often).  He was just playing the, ""I'll chase you, then you chase me"" game with my older cat .... and while the elder knew when to quit, my younger cat is now tearing around the room, even though his panting, (I wonder if I should be concerned about this ... can cats have ADHD???)
I say all this to give you a picture of what I mean when I say, ""endless energy"".  So I'm sitting here wondering what I can do to slow him down, (sitting on my lap is no-go) and suddenly I remembered I have this, ""Mewwie"" cat DVD.  I figured if nothing else, it would catch his attention, but what ended up happening was SO much better .... he finally STOPPED MOVING!!  For awhile he was up on the ledge, trying to touch the birds and crickets with his paw, then he just sat there watched them for a lot longer than I would have expected.  Next, he jumped off the ledge and LAID DOWN ON THE FLOOR, watching the TV from there.  And even as he starting to play with other toys, (any of the ""Yeeow"" catnip toys are a huge hit with both cats) he keeps coming back to watch the video for awhile.  I think the bird chirping is soothing as well, (and unlike some other reviewers, I really don't mind it). I simply cannot believe how this cat has gone from Tasmanian Devil to Snoopy almost instantaneously!  He just now jumped up in my lap to snuggle.  What a lifesaver this video is!  I'll definitely be purchasing more videos to help him, ""wind down"" after lots of activity!",1429920000,14,4936,4.150052465897167

2879246,4,B000S2O15A,"My 2 cats like to watch some of the animals, but eventually fall asleep to the bird sounds, which is not a bad thing.  I will get some bird sound CDs for them to sleep by next.",1387929600,,176,3.7567567567567566
2879247,5,B000S2O15A,"I highly recommend this movie for your cat, especially if your cat is bored!  My cat is very active; she has all kinds of toys, a cat tree, scratching post, etc, but she still seems mentally bored.  When she gets too bored, she becomes a little hell-raiser, lol.  We live in a small apartment without a screened-in porch and our windows just look out onto more apartments.  I broke down and bought this when my cat owner guilt got the best of me, and I'm glad it did!  This movie really holds her interest and seems to be mentally stimulating for her.  It features a nice variety of backyard animals (birds, squirrels) and even bugs.  Her favorite (and mine) are the chinchillas :)  She does bat at the TV screen but not so hard to damage anything.  She's watched it several times now and has not become disinterested yet.  It's fine to have this running in the background with the volume on low, but I don't let it run all day (usually one cycle through).  Anyway, if you're on the fence and would not normally consider buying your cat a video (I never did), it's a real lifesaver to have around  :)",1386374400,7,1100,4.391089108910891

They will paw at the screen and sometimes jump at it. If a bird flies away on the screen, they search the room for it. They each have their favorite parts. After a while the new wears off and the cats aren't interested any more. Then I put the CD away for a while, then reintroduce it later and it's exciting again!",1383004800,,441,3.911111111111111

I do think they get bored of seeing the same ones day after day, so recommend getting different DVD's to switch out if you're going to use this regularly. But still very impressed. Keeps it simple with large pictures in focus your cat can easily see. The chirping bird sound does get repetitive as mentioned in other reviews.",1381795200,,501,4.516483516483516
2879252,4,B000S2O15A,"Frankly, I liked the video better than my cat did.  She is not used to watching the TV screen for these things, but I hope that she will warm up to it as time goes.  Sometimes the canned background music can be a little too much the same thing.  I will also add that although she is an indoor cat, we have a large house with many windows with big sills that she can perch on and watch the whole outdoors at her leisure.  She seems content and is aging gracefully.",1380672000,,463,4.054945054945055

I tried to turn off the DVD and he protested, loudly.  He likes the birds best, and also the chinchilla.  The only ones he didn't get excited about were the white mice running through tunnels in the bread.  Unless your t.v. Is firmly mounted on the floor, I would stay nearby in case your cat tries to climb up and shake the screen to get the critters hiding behind it as our cat did.

This is really a great cat activity, especially for an indoor cat.  I plan to play it each day.",1380585600,4,612,4.092436974789916

It took a little longer for Smokey to join the fun.... but she did.  The family sat on the couch entertained by the cats being entertained by the DVD. lol  It's worth the money!!,1379376000,,348,3.9855072463768115
2879256,5,B000S2O15A,"This is my 2nd cat DVD, the last one (a different company) I have 4 starts to and 6 out of 8 gave it only one paw up... this ""mewvie"" gets four paws up! It's really more like 6 1/2 cats, as one is pretending not to like it, but I do catch him watching it, although not yet fully addicted like the other six. As I type this, one of them is staring at a blank TV screen right now, hoping I'll turn it on. As soon as they hear the TV come on, they come running. They paw it, bat it, bite it, look behind it, beside it, on top of it and everywhere else to see where that pesky squirrel could have gone, that bird flew to, or the chinchilla jumped to. They look at me with incredibly sad little faces when I turn it off, even if none of them are actually watching it! Watching them watch it is hysterical and makes me wonder about my sanity and the lack of having an actual life. If you read my review on the other DVD I bought for cats, you'll know why I start this TV for cat obsession in the first place, but I don't feel like repeating the entire long story here, suffice to say, the cat we intended it for, shows very little interest, but he is the one that I have caught watching it on the sly. Maybe I'll get him yet. Long story short, it's to try and keep him entertained more inside, so he'll stop attempting to get outside.

Pros: Cats LOVE it. I have 6 little TV junkies now! The video loops over and over from bird to animal and back again. You can select where you want to start the video, on a bird, on an animal, your choice. NO FISH! The other video had fish and they yawned at the prospect of the fish and it had way too much of the fish. Thank you for NO FISH!

Cons: The background noise is birds, always birds, there may be crickets on the screen or mice, but you still hear birds. Maybe this is to attract the cats to the TV, I have no idea, but I can mute it and they still like it. The bird sounds seem to be repetitive and get annoying after awhile and I love birds. However, the same ole same ole over and over and over... yeah, not so much.

I've tried three cat videos so far, Happy Cat TV, this one and Mewvie Episode 2. I thought they would prefer Episode 2, because in my Happy Cat TV they loved the birds. Mewvie Episode 2 is all birds. The birds however are not very ""active"", they don't fly around enough as in the Happy Cat TV. I cannot return it as it's opened, so I may try and see if they will get interested in it yet, but so far the second one just hasn't been as interesting to them. If you can't decide which one to buy from this collection, I recommend Mewvie Episode 1 (this one) over Mewvie Episode 2.",1370476800,3,2640,3.9773584905660377

It was hilarious to watch my 11 year old cat while he was watching this video.  If a bird flew out of view at the top of the screen, he would immediately look at the ceiling to try to find the bird.  Same thing happened when a bird flew out of sight at the side of the screen - he would look to the side of the TV, and even go to look behind the screen!  He loved the squirrels, and kept batting at the screen to try to ""touch"" them.  My 17 year old cat was very interested for about 10 minutes, but then left the room.
