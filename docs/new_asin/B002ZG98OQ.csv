4038682,5,B002ZG98OQ,"I saw ""Ramona & Beezus"" in the theater and was thrilled!  After growing up with the original ""Ramona"" television series, it's so neat to see a classic children's movie preserved in today's society.  The innocent, creative, and curious mind of a young child will have you laughing out loud with delight!  It's the perfect family movie for all ages!",1285891200,8,347,4.8474576271186445

4038685,5,B002ZG98OQ,Saw this movie with my daughter for her tenth Birthday. I do not know when I have enjoyed a movie more. We saw people at this movie from the very young to the elderly. It just has something for everyone. I left with a smile on my face and knowing without a doubt I would buy the DVD. I DO NOT buy DVD's!!! This is a must have! You also do not need to have read the books to appreciate the film.,1282262400,4,394,3.817073170731707
4038686,5,B002ZG98OQ,"I'm just going to go out there and say it: Elizabeth Allen's ""Ramona and Beezus"" is the best film of the summer. It may not be the most visually thrilling (""Inception"") or the most complex (""Salt""), but ""Ramona and Beezus"" is utterly charming from start to finish. In a age when films about children are laborious to endure, this is a bright, sweet and fun film. The acting is genuinely great from the very human cast. Joey King as Ramona hits every note like a seasoned professional. Her back up from John Corbett, Bridget Moynahan, Selena Gomez, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Duhamel and Sandra Oh is so solid and seamless that you believe this lot is a family. And family is what this film does so right. ""Ramona and Beezus"" captures in spades what ""Where the Wild Things Are"" tried so desperately to create: what it feels like to be a misunderstood child. It also deals with modern day family issues like the recession, divorce and dating in ways that never ring false. Sure, the film never gets dark but it also never skimps on the emotion. It's such a treat to see a film that families can enjoy, relate to and take something from without it being overly melodramatic, overly childish, or overtly religious. ""Ramona and Beezus"" is a wonderful film that deserves to find an audience. There really is something for everyone to enjoy in this truly, truly delightful gem.",1280275200,59,1366,4.672199170124482
4038687,4,B002ZG98OQ,"Ramona Quimby doesn't mean to cause trouble. If anything, her intentions are purely honorable. It's just that ... well, she's nine years old; she has a lot of energy, her imagination is vivid, and her goals are ambitious. The unfortunate side effect is that she makes her life and the lives of those around her chaotic. Her teenage sister, named Beatrice but saddled with the unwanted nickname of Beezus, thinks she's a pest. Her teacher, so stiffly matter-of-fact, doesn't like it when she makes up her own words, even if they happen to sound a lot more fun. Her mother, busy at home with an infant daughter, would love it if she would learn to control her enthusiasm. Even her father, so pleasant and involved with his children, would sometimes like to see her grow up just a little bit. The only one who seems to understand Ramona is her aunt Bea. Of course, it's easy to understand a rambunctious child when you don't have to live with her every day.

""Ramona and Beezus,"" adapted from the books by Beverly Cleary, is a film that could have easily gone wrong, appealing to younger audiences with endless juvenile slapstick routines. But there's so much more going on here than the mischievous antics of a third grader. It tells a bright, funny, heartfelt story, and despite its innocent tone and waning nostalgia, it never plays down to its audience. It supplies little Ramona with dialogue just sharp enough to make her seem observant, but not so sharp that she sounds like a nine-year-old psychotherapist. It's sweet without becoming sappy. It makes the characters likeable but flawed at the same time. Its plot is fun but not so light-hearted that it sidesteps unfortunate realities. The target audience is young girls, but one doesn't necessarily need to have a daughter or even a family to enjoy it - one only needs to remember what it was like being an imaginative child.

Ramona is played by Joey King with just the right mixture of cuteness, pluck, and clumsiness, a girl so charming and loveable that you can't help but want to be her best friend. Beezus is played by Selena Gomez not as a typecast of the mean older sister, but as a blossoming teenager with real insecurities. The two have natural onscreen chemistry. They don't play dumb. They have genuine feelings, a testament to screenwriters Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay, who clearly know a thing or two about human nature. They work just as hard on Ramona's father (John Corbett), a man who does everything he can to make his daughters feel loved and always puts a positive spin on things, even in bad times. The actual state of his well being is debatable, but the fact that he cares enough to keep smiling for his children is genuinely touching.

The plot involves Ramona's well-intentioned but misguided efforts to save her house after her father loses his job. She tries selling lemonade. She tries washing the neighbor's car. Neither yield the desired results (the latter especially). She tries circling various jobs in the classified section and showing them to her father; she even encourages him to be a firefighter. She will soon notice that he's quite good at drawing cartoons, and of that, I will say no more.

If there is a weakness to ""Ramona and Beezus,"" it's that we find ourselves caring about too many characters, some of whom aren't given enough screen time. There's a subplot, for example, involving Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin), her high school sweetheart Hobart (Josh Duhamel), and their attempts at forming a relationship; I liked them as individuals, and they get along wonderfully with Ramona, but the romance is so condensed that it seems almost trivial. We have the same problem with Beezus' adolescent crush on her classmate, which is bad because, as a plot point, it nicely plays into the film's themes of growth, individuality, and connection to family. It can be argued that the story is a little like Ramona Quimby herself - fun and adorable but also a bit unfocused.

I also would have appreciated more moments of Ramona using her imagination. Early scenes, such as when Ramona swings across a playground jungle gym or when she bounces on her bed, feature wonderfully whimsical shots of deep canyons and floating planets; late in the film, as she walks down the street, she imagines a city skyline comprised entirely of landmarks. I refuse to believe her imagination is limited to three shots, especially after hearing her opening monologue, in which she logically and understandably describes the way she views the world.

But in the grand scheme of things, these are minor complaints. Watching ""Ramona and Beezus,"" I was reminded of 2008's ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl,"" which stirred within me the same feelings of fun, adventure, and nostalgia while maintaining a sense of reality. It also gave me everything I looked for and missed in this year's ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"" namely the sense that childhood, family, and friendship were accurately being depicted. It isn't often you come across family films that really are for the whole family and not just kids; even though I'm an adult, I left the theater feeling as if I had actually experienced something worthwhile, something that was playful but respectful at the same time.",1279843200,60,5236,4.844692737430168

Often, movies are not as good as the books.  However, this is an acceptation.  Ramona and Beezus's adventures are brought together on the screen with a magic just as real as the words on the pages.  If you were a fan of the books, you must have this movie.  And if you have kids, you can use this to  enter them in to the world of Ramona Quimby.",1488499200,2,546,4.046728971962617

I think it delivers a great message about how family is important and how you love family at their best and their worse. It also gives you great examples of how sisterhood is, even when you're fighting, you still love each other very much. Ramona and Beezus don't get along most of the time, but yet, its the perfect relationship between two sisters. I really recommend this for a younger audience, if you haven't already seen it.

Joey King delivers Ramona's character amazingly well. I can't think of somebody else that would play the part. I highly suggest you purchase this movie and watch it with your family.

4039245,5,B002ZG98OQ,"Okay... I didn't think I was going to like this movie at all, but since you can't get dvds of the series (which I grew up with) I was frustrated and thought I'd give it a try - so glad that I did.

I was delighted when circumstances I remembered from the series were revisited. It was funny, sometimes sad. The plot was good and I thought Ginnifer Goodwin was a great choice for Aunt Bea... the ""Uncle Hobart/Aunt Bea"" sub-plot was the only part of this movie that I struggled with. It was entertaining half the time and the other half of the time I was disappointed because they made Hobart, well, unlikable.

A great way to bring the stories we grew up with into the 21st century. I'm so happy that they didn't ruin it.",1463270400,3,721,4.255474452554744

But the movie hits on far too many stomach-wrenching scenarios: losing a job, worry about losing a house, worry about moving, a dead pet, and a beloved family member moving away. The casting and acting was great. However, in my opinion, there were too many hard life situations included in what should have been just a fun movie.

I love the Ramona Quimby stories, and I've read everyone.  This film did not reflect my imaginings of this story, but it added dimensions I never realized.  Like how young the Quimbys were - how charismatic, innocent, beautiful, and earnest.  Yes, this is a completely different interpretation, as Beezus was never beautiful, but in this film, she is portrayed by the lovely Selena Gomez.

But Selena Gomez and Joey King have chemistry, and I fully believed their sisterhood.  Selena Gomez was truly the older good sister, folding clothes, dependable, and reliable, while Ramona was a wild card.  But you also sense that Selena Gomez is no longer Beezaus but Beatrice, and she is beautiful, strong, and independent.

I love the levity of this film.  I thought it so good.  It all worked perfectly.",1430870400,,923,4.896774193548387

4039953,5,B002ZG98OQ,"There is so much here to recommend this film for family members of every age. Without being maudlin, this film manages to explore just what it is like to be the misunderstood middle child both at home and at school. When the older child can do no wrong, the baby scores a photo-op for putting apple sauce on her head, and you can't get any praise for inventing your own vocabulary words at school, you are living the life of Ramona Quimby!

The situations that this family endures are real and presented sensitively without over-dramatization. Adults and children will relate to what is going on, and how the family comes together through everything is really delightful. There is plenty of ""fantasy"" through the eyes of Ramona, who is the highlight of the film.

Definitely recommended!",1395619200,,787,4.822222222222222

4040028,4,B002ZG98OQ,"I loved the Ramona books growing up.  They were some of my absolute favorites.  I was very worried about this movie back when it came out--I thought, ""Selena Gomez as Beezus?  That movie's going to stink!""  and I didn't see it in the theaters.  But today I finally gave in and rented it here on Amazon.  I was not expecting what I got.

What I got was a movie that captured the spirit of the books I loved so much.  It mixed some of the best parts of all the books together to make a film that made me laugh and even cry a little bit.  It had some little bits in it that were just for the people who've read the books, like that part when Susan tells Ramona not to pull her hair.  ""You've been doing it since kindergarten"".  Or the bit with the drawing of Ramona and her red boots--those parts weren't in the movie, but Ramona fans know exactly what's going on there.

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I liked it a lot and I recommend it to any Ramona fans out there.",1392422400,,977,4.105820105820106

I was afraid the disc itself might be damaged, but it doesn't appear to be (haven't viewed it, yet).  Don't know what's going on here.  Several cds were also sent with this order and the plastic cases were also cracked!  This damage had to have been caused BEFORE they were packed up for mailing, because the box they came in was perfectly unharmed.  What's going on with the folks who gather the merchandise for shipping?  Are they not looking at what they're sending us?  Disappointing.

Ramona could be any youngster anywhere and all my grandchildren (girls and boys) can relate the the situations faced by Ramona. The examples of sibling interaction are lessons that are learned in love and all children need to learn to get along with all peoples.

4040134,5,B002ZG98OQ,"Together, I've read almost all of the Ramona Quimby books with my 6-year old daughter, since I read them all as a child as well and loved them. When I realized there was a Ramona movie, I had to get it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I found that the movie was a nice mixture of some of the popular stories in the books. While the movie mixes and matches some of the various stories from the books (during which Ramona is pre-school aged and on up), the characters stay the same age - Ramona is 9 years old during the movie. Some of the content seems geared towards adults, but it seems like any good kids movie throws in something for the grown ups, and it fits well within the movie. I recommend reading all of the Ramona books before watching the movie - your little one will light up when she sees her favorite characters on screen, and when she sees some of her favorite scenes played out (i.e. the hard boiled egg). The acting is very good too - very good casting of all of the characters.",1378512000,,998,4.203125

But, this seemed geared toward older kids to me. My daughter did not enjoy this movie as much. I thought the acting was great (love Selena Gomez), but it just wasn't what I was expecting when I rented it.",1378080000,,369,4.068493150684931

Recently, my 6 year old daughter bought one of the Ramona and Beezus books, which we read and enjoyed. It made me think of the movie, so I looked for it, but couldn't find it locally. Thanks to Amazon, I got it within a day or two! My 6 year old daughter, who NEVER sits still for an entire movie, watched this one TWICE in one day! I was shocked!",1376438400,,433,3.769230769230769

4040156,5,B002ZG98OQ,Way AWESOME Movie!!! I really learned a lot from the adult characters in this movie. They really kept the adult problems simple in front of the kids. Something I need and (everybody else) needs to practice in this world. The mother was a great role model and the dad character blew me away. He lost his job due to a lay off and kept his problems off the 'family table' He came home discussed the problems in private with mom and always assured the children that all would work out. There are too many times I let my fears and anger show in front of my kids and I need to stop. I also thought it was SUPER FUN and my 6 1/2 year old loved it!,1373760000,,640,4.047244094488189

4040168,5,B002ZG98OQ,"This movie is so funny and all the characters help make it Great. The Dad looses his job, but remains hopeful. The bratty spoiled little neighbor girl who drives her trike into everyone and never gets disciplined. It is every parents dream to have their children interact the way these sisters do. The teacher who really cares about her students and believe me there are teachers like this. We laughed so hard we had to stop the disc and rewind. No cursing or swearing I can remember. Ramona thought ""guts"" was a swear word. If you like wholesome entertainment, this is a ""Keeper"". We have seen this three times.

Ramona, with crazy ideas and a spark of energy and creativity that endears her to us.  Joey King is a perfect Ramona.  And Selena Gomez surprises as the long-suffering older sister who really loves her little sister.

4040305,4,B002ZG98OQ,"We all enjoyed this movie.

My 8 year old connected immediately with Romona's character and so the similarities and my 6 year old conected with Beezus.

For the times we face as fictional the movie is it hits home and is real enough for everyone to connect to what is going on with the family and stress parents face and the sibling dynamic.

4040331,5,B002ZG98OQ,"I will be honest, I did not think I would like this movie as much as I did. It surprised me. My sister actually cried during one or two of the scenes. My favorite parts were about aunt Bea and Hobart. Especially the scenes with the car wash with Hobart and aunt Bea and when they had the water fight scene in the backyard. I highly recommend this movie. Josh who plays Hobart is one of the handsomest men alive as far as I am concerned.",1360022400,,436,4.0813953488372094

Definitely worth the time for the family.",1358208000,,351,4.415384615384616

To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be such an understatement, it swept me off my feet!  So touching, without being sappy, and sweet without being sugary, the whole family thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I read some of the books as a kid, but they weren't my favorites, but the screenplay adaptation is fabulous.  If you have a heart, you will like this movie.",1355961600,,476,4.619047619047619

At first, my husband was a bit skeptical as to whether my eight year old son and he would also be able to sit through a ""teen girl"" movie. Having not read the book, we were pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie was for our entire family. The plot was interesting, and their were many emotional elements not lost on us, as parents. Though this movie may be marketed for little girls, this is a movie that will be appreciated by any family that enjoys clean humor, a well thought out story line and believable acting.

4040494,5,B002ZG98OQ,"You know what makes Romona nad Beezus such a great movie for kids?  It's the fact that despite all the horrible luck Romona has, she hardly ever lets it show or lets it get her down to the point of being negative.  She's alays optimistic, encouraging, approachable and friendly.

Oh yeah, she gets bad grades at school but that's because her mind is always elsewhere.  She's actually really smart- much smarter than both of her older sisters in fact.  Speaking of which... she spends quite a bit of time with her older sisters, especially the one played by Selena Gomez (named Beezus).  They're more like friends (well, except when the day comes when they both get their own bedrooms- THEN the tension begins!)

If you have a child who's constantly hard on him or herself and gives up easily and is afraid to try, let the little girl played by Romona be an example how you handle crappy situations whenever they come.  Handle them by looking into the future and being positive.

There's a curly-haired toity hoity classmate that Romona LOVES to pick on!  Let's be honest, you're glad someone who thinks she's so perfect gets a little reality check by having her hair pulled on among other things.  Come on admit it!

Anyway, Romona finds herself involved in numerous obstacles.  She wants to feed the baby... something goes wrong.  She wants to show her classmates an egg trick at the lunchroom... something goes wrong.  She wants to operate her own lemonade stand... something goes wrong.  She wants to wash and clean her sisters boyfriends truck because of a &100 offer... you guessed it (in this case something goes REALLY wrong, haha).

The main storyline is that Romona doesn't want to move away when it's discovered her father has a job offer in a faraway place.  Throughout the movie this main concept comes back and haunts Romona.

It's a light comedy, and it's a pretty good one too.  Your kids will love it, I guarantee it.",1329955200,,1933,4.696428571428571
4040495,5,B002ZG98OQ,"The Blu-Ray of ""Ramona and Beezus"" is the same great film about Ramona Quimby and her big sister Beezus and their parents in their home in Portland, OR (with Vancouver as a stand-in for Portland), with Joey King in the same superb performance as before, but this edition has some new features that are included exclusively on the Blu-Ray (the features from the original DVD edition are also included):

--Deleted scenes: The original DVD edition had four deleted scenes; the Blu-Ray has three more deletions, for a total of 7.

--A Day in the Life of Joey King: This 5-min. feature is an insider's view of what a normal day was like for Joey King, star of ""Ramona and Beezus,"" who went by ""Pickle"" on the walkie-talkie. It shows her at makeup, in one of her homeschooling sessions (she was focused on fractions in this one), and in the process of shooting the playground rings scene with Jason Spevack (who played her friend Howie Kemp); the school scenes were shot at an actual school. One thing that I was surprised to learn about her is that she has cat allergies WRT shooting the scenes w/Picky-Picky.

--Selena and Joey Audition Footage: Two scenes of Selena Gomez and Joey King in rehearsal. One is when Beezus wanted to die after Ramona embarrassed her at the lemonade stand; the other is when Ramona is opening up her lemonade stand. These were the rough cuts of the actual scenes. It should be noted that Joey was not in the hairstyle that she would have in the film as Ramona.

--Fox Movie Channel Presents Life After Film School: Director Elizabeth Allen is questioned by three film students in a 22-min. interview.

The other features that were carried over from the DVD edition include:
--a 3-min. gag reel;

--""My Ramona with Author Beverly Cleary,"" in which the author talks about how Ramona came to be popular and some of the stars of the film talk about what the books meant to them (4 min.+);

--""Show and Tell Film School"" (7 min.), where director Elizabeth Allen and star Joey King present tips on how to make your own film, with a bit of an insider's view of how they made ""Ramona"";

--and the original theatrical trailer.

In addition to the features, the film is presented in HD on this Blu-Ray edition, and has English and French audio, and English and Spanish subtitles (the same languages as on the DVD edition). The Blu-Ray comes in a 3-pack with a copy of the original DVD edition and a digital copy for portable devices. The artwork for the Blu-Ray disc is the same as the original DVD edition, with the included DVD having somewhat different artwork (this one had Selena and Joey in a field of flowers, apparently); the digital copy shows Ramona hanging upside down from the ""Z"" and ""S"" in the title. The three discs are in a clear blue rounded square case, with the Blu-Ray and DVD on a hinged flipper, and the digital copy on its own on the right-hand inside of the case.

The menu for the BD is essentially the same as for the DVD, but the options are on tiny scraps of paper.

In short, whether you get this combo Blu-Ray/DVD/digital copy, or you get the original DVD edition by itself, I think that you'll be treating yourself to what I believe is one of the best films I've ever seen, with one of the greatest performances ever from a juvenile actress by the name of Joey King.",1328659200,,3313,4.5512605042016805

4040503,3,B002ZG98OQ,"Spoilers below:

This movie changes some important parts from the book - mainly the ages of the characters.

There is too much kissing.  It is stupid - we don't care about these relationships, we want to hear about Beezus and Ramona like they are in the books.  Here, Henry Huggins is like 18 and that's too old.

Also, there is one very sad part that need not be in the film - one character dies.  This really is disturbing.

Other than this, it is a good movie.  Ramona and Howie are good characters.

Ramona also runs away in this movie.  We thought the parents had a strange and inappropriate reaction to this, even though they meant well.",1321660800,4,643,4.418803418803419

Selena Gomez has become such a star at only 19 years old that if you put her name or face on anything it will sell not matter how good or bad it is because she has become a heartthrob in her generation. Bottom line is this movie should not be tied to the books. And I watched parts of it.

4040540,5,B002ZG98OQ,"My 6.5-year-old and I have enjoyed Beverly Cleary's Ramona series of books and I thought she'd appreciate the movie, so we watched it as a family tonight. All of us, including my husband, enjoyed it. The movie combines different elements from the various Ramona books, so it is not based on just one Ramona storyline. Nevertheless, the movie flows well and is entertaining.

Ramona Quimby is a precocious nine-year-old, and is credibly played by adorable young actor, Joey King. Her older sister Beezus (Beatrice) is played by Selena Gomez. The pair share great chemistry and are a joy to watch on-screen. Dad Robert is played by John Corbett, and his wife, Dorothy is played by Bridget Moynahan (both actors were also on Sex and the City). There's a baby, and aging cat Picky Picky, and the family leads an idyllic middle-class life until something unexpected happens. Dad Robert loses his job as a VP in a storage company (unlike the novels, the Quimby family here is portrayed as being upper middle class) and mom Dorothy is forced to go back to work in a medical clinic. The family is placed under great stress, resulting in family quarrels and the fear of losing their home.

In her inimitable fashion, Ramona tries to help out, but each attempt fails disastrously, and finally at wits' end, Ramona makes a drastic decision. Will everything work out for the Quimby family? There's lots of funny moments, and poignant ones too, and enough entertaining moments for the entire family.",1315526400,,1486,4.869565217391305
4040541,1,B002ZG98OQ,"Beverly Cleary is a wonderful author.  Her books are must-reads for any young girl in particular.  The world of Cleary's Quimby family is an America in the 1970s and 1980s when lower-middle class families did fairly well, had reliable public school systems, and could focus their time on their own relationships.  Mr. Quimby was a supermarket employee who made enough for his family to live on.  He went back to school, and his wife was a clerical employee for a doctor's office.  The two girls read books in their spare time and walked to school, which they took very seriously.

The movie contains almost none of Cleary's work.  It moves the setting from the world of middle class America to upper-class America.  That is itself a travesty.  It substitutes people's dreams for more money for the message of Cleary--which is that America is great because public school works well even for families who are barely scraping by.  The Quimby house in the movie looks nothing like the one in the book.  And the girls are nothing like them either.  Ramona is not a trained, cute girl in the book.  She is relentlessly plain but so intelligent that she makes you want to cheer for her.

The books are so much more sophisticated than the film.  And they provide a memory of what it was like before right-wing politics took over our discourse on education, on unemployment, and on family structure.

Please do your children a favor.  Read the books to them!",1315094400,21,1449,4.709163346613546

Joey King was cute and adorable as Ramona, but Beezus didn't really do too much. Ramona Quimby is a hyper 3rd grader with an overactive imagination. When her dad is hired, she bonds with him and tries to build up his confidence, while trying to save the house and deal with her aunt falling back in love with an old boyfriend. I would recommend RAMONA AND BEEZUS!!!",1308614400,4,515,4.375
4040558,3,B002ZG98OQ,"Look, Ramona and Beezus is a great film for kids and family but it's too expensive here. There's not even special features like the making of the movie to justify the high cost. It's a g-rated film based on the famous children's novels by Beverly Cleary. Now while I enjoyed the movie, I do find it suitable for all audiences. I find the cost here to be ridiculously high in order to receive it.

The film is okay nothing spectacular. It's a family film with Ramona played perfectly by Joey King and Selena Gomez plays her sister, Beatrice nicknamed Beezus by Ramona. John Corbett and Bridget Monahan are fine as her parents. Ginnifer Goodwin is great as Aunt Beatrice and Sandra Oh is great as Ramona's teacher.

4040577,4,B002ZG98OQ,"This is the second book-to-movie adaptation that I've seen and enjoyed this year.  The other was Flipped, based on Wendelin van Draanen's book by the same title.  When I was younger, my older sister and I both adored Beverly Cleary's books (Ramona series, Ralph S. Mouse books, etc.).  I have to say, this is a wonderful and satisfactory adaptation.

Ramona Quimby has a rather vivid, wonderful imagination, something that doesn't bode too well for her in school (Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy plays her teacher) and which often lands her in some rather sticky situations.  Later, the viewer discovers that her parents are having some financial issues that only get worse after her father loses his job due to downsizing.  Yet, Ramona remains unfazed and is determined to save her family by taking on some jobs of her own while her father searches for a new position.  We get some side romances between Beezus (aka Beatrice, played by Selena Gomez) and her childhood friend Henry (this one is a really minor side-plot) and between Bea (Ramona's aunt) and Hobart (Josh Duhamel's pretty much great in any role he does, so his addition adds some nice comedic moments to the movie).

This is a very enjoyable movie and is also very clean.  It is rare to have a kid's movie these days that is actually rated-G (the majority are PG), and it is even rarer to have a kid's movie that doesn't have a single dirty joke.  And the cleanliness of jokes and situations does not detract from viewer enjoyment at all in this case.  Everyone in my family who watched this movie ended up loving it.  If you have a kid or teen who loves Selena Gomez, this would be a great movie for them to watch.  This could also be an excellent opportunity to get kids interested in reading (if they like the movie, they might want to try some of Beverly Cleary's books).

Ramona's antics are funny and cute.  There are some sweet family moments and watching this movie left me in a good mood afterwards (had been having a bad day).  This movie is appropriate for any age; there's really nothing bad about it, and I highly recommend it.  Overall: this is another example of a book-to-movie adaptation done right.  Plus, this shows that you can make a movie funny and family-friendly without having any dirty jokes whatsoever.

4040582,4,B002ZG98OQ,My two granddaughters loved it (ages 7 & 8).  My daughter watched it with them and thought it was a good movie.,1297900800,,111,4.045454545454546
4040583,4,B002ZG98OQ,"Having thoroughly read the majority of Beverly Cleary's novels as a kid, the Ramona series being my favorite, I of course HAD to see the movie that someone FINALLY decided to make (never mind the fact that I'm a young adult that should be watching though-provoking indie films and halfhearted rom-coms instead of family-friendly flicks). I was skeptical since the books are near and dear to me and I would hate to see them ruined by a poor film adaptation, but generally, I loved it and it exceeded my expectations! Joey King and Selena Gomez were a perfect Ramona and Beezus, respectively, and I really liked John Corbett as the dad, and Ginnifer Goodwin, who normally annoys me, was spot-on as the cool-but-not-so-cool Aunt Bea. I was pleased to find that the film remained true to the books while keeping up with the present day, although the books' ubiquitous topics of sibling rivalry, family, and using imagination to deal with life's roadblocks really are timeless.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I was just hoping to see more of the major incidents that occurred in the books (ahem, Chevrolet in the oven ... or Chevrolet at all!) and more buildup around the ones that were featured in the film. (And I wasn't crazy about the choice to include the burr crown.) For instance, I will remember reading about Ramona taking out her rage on the tube of toothpaste she squeezed into the sink my whole life, but it was portrayed in the movie as just another minor ""Ramona thing"". I realize wasting toothpaste was a bigger deal for a family in the Quimby's financial situation back when the book took place, and thus a major incident in the book, but I would have liked for that scene and the other standout incidents to have had more context and buildup. Although, to be fair, if they had chosen to include all of my Ramona highlights, the movie would have been hours long, so I am happy with most of what they chose to include and how it was portrayed.

All in all, this is a great, appropriate family film that people of all ages can enjoy. If you were a Ramona reader, you'll love the movie. Of course it's not exactly like the books - there's no way around that - but it most certainly does them justice.",1297814400,3,2213,4.557788944723618
4040584,5,B002ZG98OQ,This movie is a nice fun family movie. Joey King and Selena Gomez were great in it. The story will keep you entertained from start to finish. Ramona and Beezus learn that anything's possible when you believe in yourself and rely on each other. It's a feel good movie all the way and of course has a happy ending.,1297209600,2,312,4.305084745762712
4040585,3,B002ZG98OQ,"I have to say that my daughter really loved this movie.  She first saw it in school and thought it was fantastic.  I was looking forward to seeing it with her, but have to say I wasn't over impressed.  I can't say it was horrible, but it just didn't grab me.  I didn't come to love the characters.  I didn't much care what happened at the end.  I love kids movies...family friendly hits are always a treat, but this one was a take it or leave it sort of film for me.  When I told my daughter, she just shrugged her shoulders and said, ""Well Mom, God made everyone different and maybe he made you not to like this movie!""  I got a kick out of that.  But it's true...there is always something for everyone, and this just wasn't for me.  My daughter, however, really enjoyed it.",1297123200,,775,4.210884353741497
4040626,5,B002ZG98OQ,"Having grown up reading the Ramona books, I couldn't wait to watch this movie. I wasn't disappointed. This movie is great, clean family fare. There was nothing objectionable and I applaud the producers for creating a movie the entire family can watch. There were a few scenes, such as Ramona dangling over a canyon that might be scary to very young children (under 5).

There are wonderful discussion-starters throughout the movie. For instance, Ramona always feels the need to compare herself to her older sister, Beezus. Beezus, of course, sees Ramona as nothing more than a pesty little sister who is always causing trouble. How many children could identify themselves with either Ramona or Beezus?

Some of the other children in the movie don't treat Ramona kindly and they laugh at her on more than one occasion. While this movie is not a Christian movie, it did give me the opportunity to remind my children that no matter how the world sees them, it's who they are in Christ that matters. Ephesians 2:10,  John 1:12, and 1 Samuel 16:7 came to mind. Strong family bonds and joining together when times are tough was also a good discussion starter. Family members may not always see eye to eye, but when critical matters arise, unity is crucial.

Full of humor, a strong love expressed by family members for each other, some touching parts, and a bit of romance, make this a movie I would highly recommend and have added to my Mom-Approved movies list on my blog.",1297036800,2,1468,4.745098039215686
4040627,5,B002ZG98OQ,"Okay, I must admit that I have never read the books.  My wife has and she refuses to watch this movie because the books were so dear to her.  Whatever the case I rented it and watched it on a sick day, and found that this film was a treat. Of course it's predictable and has a very ""Hollywood"" happy ending, but it was surprisingly fun to watch.  If you like family films - give it a try!",1296432000,,388,3.948717948717949

I didn't think to go see it when it was at the theater, because it didn't draw my interest enough. I guess I can say that it was worth watching from home as a rental. The best part in the movie for me was the artwork in the mural and the happy ending for everyone...the one dark moment wasn't my favorite, it could have been left out.

My children and I love the Ramona books. This movie actually takes story elements out of multiple books, rather than just following what happens in the Ramona and Beezus book.

This movie was well-cast with a well-written script which stayed true to the characters. I love the way this film portrays a family. Parents and children who love each other but experience real life: new baby, job loss, crazy childhood antics, ups and downs of sibling relationships, etc. And finally a wonderful film for all of my five children, ages 2-10. It was clean without violence, innuendos, characters in revealing clothing, etc. This is a movie suitable for all children yet endearing to adults. My children, husband, and I all love it.

Though we often enjoy rental movies, I very rarely purchase them. However, I ordered this one on Bluray from Amazon as this is one we will enjoy over and over again.",1295740800,2,1056,4.702702702702703

I've seen other book adaptations made by Walden Media. They really do a good job.  ""Ramona and Beezus"" is no exception.
If you've read the books, (which I hope you have!) you will, as you watch this movie, see plot twists coming that were in the books. You'll be watching a part of it, and think ""I wonder if this is going towards  __ (fill in the blank)"", and you won't generally get disappointed!
That said, however, I felt they may have tried to cram too many events from too many of the books into one film. Don't get me wrong. I loved seeing the wonderful plot twists played out on screen, but I just felt like perhaps there were too many crammed into too short a time.
Joey King and Selena Gomez star in this movie as Ramona and her big sis, Beezus. It's a fun film that I think will surprise and please even the biggest fans of Cleary's book series.",1295481600,2,1118,4.314285714285714

Ramona and Beezus is the best family movie i have seen in a long time!!! We had from 9 years old to 68 years old watching this with TWO teenagers in between and EVERYONE loved it.

It keeps you interested, entertained and is just a good movie. The story moves at a good pace, the laughs are everywhere, and it touches with just enough emotion to make you feel it. It is not overly sappy or ""kiddified"". Everyone can enjoy this movie.

My only complaint is i think Ginnifer Goodwin was miscast in this movie. She did not fit to me, (she was the only one). Something about her was off. She didn't have ""something"" that made her blend with the cast. I LOVE LOVE John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan. Joey King (Ramona) is spot on.",1295308800,2,822,4.359477124183006

This is one of the funnest movies I've seen, and it moved some real emotion as well.  When I got the dvd, I was wondering if it would be as good the 2nd time through, especially on a tv screen.  Well, it was as near as could be expected.  And my memory had played an odd trick: remembering there was a lot less Beezus than I thought there would be, there was now a lot more than I remembered; so I was pleased with that.  My appreciation for Joey King as Ramona perhaps grew, if possible: perfect casting.  The special features were not long, but interesting.  Of the four deleted scenes, 3 were rightly deleted, but the churchstep scene was excellent.  The gag reel was amusing, but much less so than the movie itself.  Beverly Cleary talking about her books was a wonderful thing.  If you like good fun with a heart-tug, I encourage you to get this dvd.",1294444800,2,1145,4.314553990610329

Beezus is a girl who wants to do nothing more then to please others, unfortunately luck is not always on her side.  She makes things more colorful and will make you smile throughout the movie.

4040756,4,B002ZG98OQ,"- A despondent Beezus: ""Who could ever love a girl named Beezus?""
- Ramona, hesitantly: ""Jesus?""

In Portland, Oregon dwells Ramona Quimby who is nine years, three months old and, despite her older sister Beezus' assertions, isn't at all a pest or a nuisance (except that she is). Ramona's big imagination lends to plenty of daydreaming and playacting and silly shenanigans, and the rest of the kids in her class think she's daft, her teacher rendered bemused and resigned. Ramona means well, has a big heart, comes from a loving family, but she's like Pollyanna and Walter Mitty and an incoming wrecking ball all rolled into one.

The story's conflict surfaces when Ramona and Beezus' dad gets laid off and suddenly, for the Quimbys, there's penny pinching and the hovering threat of losing their house. Things like this will sometimes have a bigger impact on the children. Ramona not only becomes terrified of losing her home but, after dialogue with a snotty classmate, she also dreads the possibility of her parents divorcing and maybe having to move to Tacoma. Ramona determines to remedy all this. Everyone take cover.

Based on Beverly Cleary's beloved children's books, RAMONA AND BEEZUS and its watchability rest strictly on Joey King's shoulders (Selena Gomez only has a supporting role, really). And to lift one of Ramona's made-up words, Joey King's presence makes this movie all the ""funner."" It's a fine line to toe, I think. Ramona gets into so many scrapes that inconvenience so many people that it would've been disastrous if the filmmakers had tapped the wrong girl to play her. It would've been all too easy for the audience to perceive Ramona as annoying and even unsympathetic. But Joey King is awesome and so very likable, and she works the crowd with that infectious giggle and that marvelously expressive face and a certain irrepressibility. How could you not forgive her her well-intentioned screw-ups?

The rest of the cast is really good, especially John Corbett who plays Ramona's understanding, nurturing father. Ramona's interactions with her father and with her sister Beatrice (forever known as ""Beezus"") prove the backbone of the story. I enjoyed watching the sisters' relationship unfold. Ramona, always in trouble about something, fears that she'll never do as well as Beezus who always garners straight A's and is well liked by everyone. And so maybe the turning point for Ramona is when she gets those words of encouragement from Beezus at the end of that one sad evening.

Oh, and somehow Ramona does manage to save the day. Go figure.

Watch RAMONA AND BEEZUS and, chances are, you'll be enchanted by the wonderful Joey King. There's a comfort and a warmth in watching this movie, and you may even get caught up with the side stories, whether it's Ramona's beloved cute Aunt Bea re-sparking an old romance or Beezus kind of striking up a first one. If you want to meet an extraordinary girl bubbling over with life and imagination and who, in prepping for a princess audition, ends up in the bushes and concocts a makeshift tiara out of burrs, well, that's Ramona Quimby all over. Grown-ups will smile throughout this film. Kids will adore it. Fair warning, though, that your young 'uns may pick up Ramona's favorite curse word. Heck, I may even adopt it. There's something pretty visceral about screaming ""Ah, guts!"" to the heavens. I'm right, yeah?

The DVD's bonus stuff: ""Show & Tell Film School"" is seven minutes of director Elizabeth Allen giving tips on how to make a movie and we see how she herself applied these tips to her shooting of RAMONA & BEEZUS; 4 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:04:11 minutes); a gag reel (00:02:50); ""My Ramona"" features an interview with author Beverly Cleary (00:04:14); and the theatrical trailer.",1290643200,4,3771,4.947867298578199
4040757,5,B002ZG98OQ,"I must admit...when getting this movie,I had no plans on watching it.  Just wanted a new movie for my 8 year old daughter to watch...and boy has she ever.  The first time she watched it,she did so on a laptop.  I'd hear her laugh out loud and a couple times I'd look over and she'd be teary eyed.  That night she had her 10 year old brother watch it with her.  He loved it as well.  So a couple days later I got bored and decided to watch while they were in school.  I was surprised at how good it actually was.  I can see now why my daughter has watched it so many times.  If you've got a little girl(or boy LOL) this is a must have for their Movie collection!",1289952000,5,661,3.946969696969697

4040759,5,B002ZG98OQ,"When I was younger I used to always read these books and loved them. As an young adult I wanted to see what the movie was like. I guess I wanted to take a trip down memory lane and I'm sure glad that I did. This movie is not just for kids. Granted it doesn't have any nudity or cursing if you're into that stuff you will be disappointed BUT it does have a wonderful story if you like that kind of stuff. This is actually a movie that many people can relate to especially if you have a sibling. This movie is about Ramona which is the middle child just trying to fit in any way that she can. She feels like her older sister Beezus is perfect and her younger sister is cute no matter what she does. Ramona and Beezus is really a movie all about family which you do not find much nowadays. The entire cast had so much chemistry together and it really showed in their acting and made it all the much better to watch. If you want to just sit back and watch a good heartfelt movie then look no further than Ramona and Beezus.

I highly recommend Ramona and Beezus to anyone who wants to watch a great movie.",1289347200,7,1101,4.073732718894009

Although its been many years since I read the books I think the movie had a slightly different feel than the books did, more heartwarming I think but it was a good movie!  I'd highly recommend it.",1289347200,2,293,4.0344827586206895

Absolutely nothing scary or offensive in this movie, and it has great messages.  I'd have to say that it is now one of my favorites.",1288656000,2,279,4.0
4040762,5,B002ZG98OQ,"What I Can Tell You:
Selena Gomez and Joey King look like sisters. The movie is utterly adorable and I am completely in love with Joey King. She is an amazing little actress and reminds me of Dakota Fanning in her expressions. She will be a big star!

Great storyline about Ramona who marches to the beat of her own drum. She is often in trouble, completely mischievous and totally innocent. She doesn't try to get in trouble, trouble just has a way of finding her.

Both of my kids love the movie (5 year old girl and 7 year old boy) as Ramona has a wonderful imagination and of often very funny. I wasn't surprised that the kids loved the movie, as I loved it too. Ramona is the perfect combination of charm, wit, and cuteness without being obnoxious.

Beside Ramona and Beezus; we have their parents played by Sex in the Cities John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan. Aunt Bee is played by Big Love's Ginnfer Goodwin and Josh Drummel plays Aunt Bee's High School sweetheart and Grey's Anatomy's Sandra Oh is a teacher. The movie covers some tough subjects without ever getting dark and depressing. Great screenplay!

I have yet to read the series of books by Beverly Cleary but plan to buy the movie and book collection for my niece this Christmas.

Great movie from start to finish.",1287878400,5,1281,4.528138528138528
4040763,5,B002ZG98OQ,"Beverly Cleary's ""Ramona"" books, as well as her other series and standalones are about half a dozen chapters long.  Each one is carefully detailed and paced - even if the event would seem minor to an adult - it's treated with the importance as a child of Ramona's age would view it.

In contrast, this movie pitches Cleary's plots to you like fastballs.  For example, first Ramona gets a bad report card and curses (Ramona the Brave), then she makes a mess with toothpaste (Ramona and Her Mother), and then her dad brings home Gummi Bears for her and sister to share (Ramona and Her Father), and so on.  There's also some fantasy sequences to emphasize Ramona's runaway imagination and to give the film even more of a child's eye-view perspective.

The overall plot is basically borrowed from ""Ramona Forever,"" as Howie Kemp's annoying Uncle Hobart tries to (re) woo Ramona's Aunt Bea.  There's also a storyline (Ramona and Her Father) about their dad losing his job (which caused an audible gasp in my audience).  This isn't sugarcoated, although there's a happy ending for all the characters.

Joey King does an outstanding job as Ramona, as does Selena Gomez as Beezus (although physically, she's too glamorous for my idea of the character), and the rest of the cast is solid, too.

Adult-appropriate only material: Absolutely none, although if your kids know someone who's lost their job, they might ask questions about the bank repossessing their home.  So be prepared.",1286409600,28,1474,4.883534136546185

8385098,4,B002ZG98OQ,"I didn't know this was a summary of all 8 books, instead of a movie based off of the first book, Beezus and Ramona. I think they did a good job overall, and took the best parts from every book.

Things I liked:
1. I think the actors were great!
2. Twice in the movie they combine 2 scenes (Ramona wanting to do commercials and Ramona making a nettle-crown) and (Ramona cracking a egg on her head and frowning after ""say peas"" for a school pic) and I think that was a good move, too squish things together instead of taking them out
3. I like how they showed Ramona's imagination
4. I like her teacher's character
5. Picky-Picky was a great actor although-SPOILER ALERT- he dies just like he does in the books
6. The parts they added, like the smoke alarm going off, wrecking Hobart's car, etc. didn't ruin the rest of the movie
7. I thought it was nice how her Dad's mural made them be able to stay where they were living

The things I didn't like:
1. I think they spent a little too much time on the Hobart/Bea relationship, when they could have spent that extra time on Ramona.
2. They added a cheesy Beezus/Henry relationship. I know they are trying to appeal to all ages as it is a family movie, but in the book, Ramona is the one who says she wants to marry Henry.
3. They didn't make Willa-Jean bratty enough (I enjoyed her character)
4. In the book, the author states that Henry never goes anywhere with out his dog, Ribsy, and there are funny scenes with Ribsy in the book, but he is nowhere to be seen in the movie

Overall, I and my family like it a lot and we would definitely recommend!!",1522800000,,1599,4.2360655737704915
