475336,4,6302491967,"I remember seeing this movie in the theater back in the early '70s.  While I recognized it as a European attempt to do a Western ""Dirty Dozen"" I really liked the film.  The main character was someone I did not recognize but Chuck Conners, Richard Crenna and Woody Strode were mainstays that always delivered.  Its a War Story, revenge/redemption story with action and violence (what more can you ask?) with the standard characters setting out to do what the regular Army cannot.  All the elements to include difficult training period, internal strife between members, a misson that at best will result in mostly everyone getting killed-- all are here.  The explosives expert who is also a preacher played by Chuck Connors, two psychotic brothers who make a Gatling Gun team, tough Irish sergeant, foreign/British Officer who is doing a study of US Cavalry operations in the South West.  A great cameo by John Huston as the Regional Military Commander who authorizes the mission.  His few scenes as the hard bitten Officer who wants results is worth watching the movie for alone.  Officers with that attitude would be useful today but of course, they would be politically incorrect...but back to the film.  Watch it!  Campy and formula yes....and I loved every minute of it!  I was able to find it on a DVD with another movie in NTSC on Amazon.  It is available.",1302134400,,1361,4.818965517241379
475337,4,6302491967,"Director of the western genre, Burt Kennedy, (the war wagon, seven men from now) rolls the camera to an all-star cast, Chuck Connors, Woody Strode, Richard Crenna, Bekim Fehmiu, Slim Pickens, Pat Wayne, legendary director John Huston, and other familiar faces fill the screen in this story of vengeance and rebellion. A cavalry officer's wife is skinned alive by ruthless apaches and the vengeful soldier (Fehmiu) goes out on a one man killing spree against the savage Indians, until a strategic General (Huston) sees the potential of the man forming a band of special forces to help be rid of the apaches who threaten the territory and the lives of settlers and farmers. Filled with loads of action and scenery ""the deserter"" delivers like the classic cavalry films of old. Make sure you purchase the Paramount version VHS, the best transfer.",1251763200,,843,4.98581560283688
475338,5,6302491967,"The Deserter, known in some circles as ""Ride to Glory"" is a riveting movie.  It depicts a Captain of Cavalry, who leaves the army after his wife is killed by Apaches.  He is brought back to train and lead a special detachment that will invade and attack the Apache warcamp.  The movie is filled with great stars and character actors.  Slim Pickens and Woody Strode are great.  I have no idea what happened to Bekim Fehmu, but he delivered a stirring performance in the lead role.
If you like movies featuring the U.S. Cavalry and the Apaches and a lot of action in an old school western, you can't miss with this one.",1202428800,7,617,4.424778761061947
475339,4,6302491967,"richard crenna gives an excellent portrayal as a grudgeful, hard-bitten cavalry officer who now needs an old enemy to accomplish what his troops have been unable to do.  as a western/action/adventure this movie has great acting, stunning scenery, and some rough-hewn comedy.  the hero is believable, the apaches are fierce, and the rest of the cast performs well in their respective roles.",1169769600,2,389,5.258064516129032
475340,4,6302491967,"This is a solid ""guys on a mission"" story, led by the effective, but unlikely Bekin Fehmiu (making this a Middle-Eastern Western, I suppose). It is surprisingly politically incorrect even for its release-1971. Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee was a best seller and most films at this time-A Man Called Horse, Little Big man, Man in the Wilderness, etc. were being very simpatico with Native Americans. Not so The Deserter! Fehmiu is on a one-man Jihad to wipe out all the Redskins after his wife is butchered. There are no apologies here for his revenge on the Indians. So if your sympathies extend for films like Dances with Wolves, I would stay away from The Deserter. If you can read and appreciate Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and STILL enjoy a good adventure with a high Apache body count, then dig in. What really makes The Deserter a long-lost gem is its deep supporting cast of all manner of late-sixties favorites. One might say, ""All that and Slim Pickens, too!"" As with many Westerns of this time, the color was spectacular in the theatrical release, so don't expect that on its video release-too bad. Another note to ponder is its title, topical for the time in reference to the unpopularity of the Vietnam War.",1116374400,,1221,4.657407407407407
475341,4,6302491967,"The Deserter is an exciting, little-known western with a great cast and plenty of action.  After his wife is tortured and murdered by Apaches, Captain Victor Caleb deserts his post and goes on a killing spree, dispatching Apaches wherever he can find them.  Almost a year later, the Army needs Caleb.  Apache chief Mangus Durango is organizing a huge war party that will sweep across the southwest, killing everyone in their path.  The Army recruits Caleb to put together a group of men and train them to fight like an Apache warrior.  Then, Caleb and his squad must try and stop Durango before he crosses the border.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie, considering I had never heard of it before.  The storyline is similar to the Dirty Dozen with men being recruited for a suicide mission.  Great cast, quirky musical score, and lots of good action.

  International star Bekim Fehmiu plays Captain Victor Caleb, the leader of the squad sent to stop the Apaches, in the title role.  Fehmiu receives excellent support from the rest of the cast.  Richard Crenna and John Huston star as Major Brown and General Miles, the two superior officers who send Caleb on his mission.  Ricardo Montalban and Slim Pickens play scouts Nachai and Tallinger, two of Caleb's friends.  The rest of the squad includes Chuck Connors as Reynolds, the chaplain who is an expert with dynamite, Ian Bannen as Crawford, the English officer studying US cavalry tactics, Brandon de Wilde as Ferguson, the young lieutenant, Woody Strode as Jackson, the strong/tough man, Albert Salmi as Schmidt, the unruly sergeant, Patrick Wayne as Robertson, the gatling gun operator, Fausto Tozzi as Orozco, the knife fighter, and Doc Greaves as Scott, the doctor.  It is a shame that this movie has not been released on DVD with a widescreen presentation.  If you can find this movie on VHS, it is well worth it.  For a little-known, exciting western with an all-star cast and good action, check out The Deserter!",1101427200,8,1997,4.84070796460177
475342,5,6302491967,"It's got it all, 'cept the ""Duke"", but it's got his son, Patrick running a gatlin gun. Diverse, elite unit formed from calvery at the fort: Chuck Conners, is the preacher who knows demolition, Slim Pickens & Ricardo Montalban are the civilian scouts, Plenty of others expertly cast, even a cool dog. They're fightin indians, but not any ordinary indians, rouge, renengade apache's! All with the classic western ending. ""B"" movie, not PC, maybe, But for the category, An excellent choice.
