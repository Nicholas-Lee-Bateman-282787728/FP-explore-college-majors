8413947,5,B0042TO3P8,"It took a while to receive this, but it did come from a private seller.  besides, you don't care how long it took for me to get the product.  You want to know if it's worth buying.  The answer is...absolutely YES!!

  I use youtube and other sites like most of you to find golf instruction for free, but I can honestly say, i have never seen a package put together as nicely as this series, especially for a one time low fee. (as opposed to the sites that charge a monthly fee, of which i only found one worth the investment.  (Its Rotary Swing Tour incase you were curious.  check it out))

  In any case, I have seen instruction and drills on this DVD that I had not seen elsewhere, and they explain it so that you REALLY understand why these will improve your game.  Obviously, they are PGA tour pro teachers, so they know their business.  (Not like the guy in the stall next to you on the range that always wants to tell you what you are doing wrong)

 Part 1 - Short game.  Outstanding tips.  This is the first place where i've seen how to choose your club AND swing length based upon the combanation of the ""air time"" and ""ground time"" between your ball and the flag.  This will defintely save you strokes, taking a whole lot of guess work out of the process.  I am already playing with much more confidence from 150 yards and in.  Bunkers, chips, pitches, rough, fairway  ...it's all covered in an easy to understand fashion.

Part two - Off the Tee.  The reason why I love this is that they are not at all obsessed with maxing out distance (often at the costof accuracy)  They explain driving ""with a purpose and a goal""  for the first time, i appreciate getting the ball where i need it to be, rather than only ""as far as I can get it""

CONs:  not many.  The only thing i found mildly distracting is the editing choice they made to do a split screen each time the instructor struck the ball.  While I do appreciate the reason for doing this, and the intended merit behind it, I found it a little annoying that when the screen split, showing face on and down the line simultaneously (to catch the ball flight), it was hard to see the swing technique all the way through, as the split frames became smaller.

  I think if you combine this DVD, the PGA instructional DVD called Touch and Tempo, and McLains 8 step swing, you would have about all you need to play a great game of golf.  golf is not an easy game to be sure, but honestly, I was making it much harder than it needed to be.  This DVD truly molded my way of thinking about golf as an entire game, and not just a series of trying to perfect swing techniques.  enjoy and learn!!",1370908800,4,2644,4.251509054325956
