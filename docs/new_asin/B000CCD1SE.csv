8097220,5,B000CCD1SE,"MEJORANDO TU VIDA was a nice surprise for me, as I had never heard of this DVD when I came across it in a store recently. It's got eight different sections of cardiovascular, toning, and weight-lifting exercises, and is led by the enthusiastic and sexy Mexican TV star Gabriela Spanic (""Gaby""), with 2 or 3 other fit-looking ladies (and sometimes a guy) joining her. Gaby starts each section with a short discussion of what they'll be doing, then they carry it out for several minutes. Many of the cardiovascular exercises are based on dance steps, which is more fun but also more difficult to follow exactly as it changes rapidly, though I don't think that matters since the point is to keep moving.

Gaby is lots of fun, while she and the other ladies are very easy to look at for sure! Also, this was filmed in a very attractive indoor setting, with Latin American instrumental music playing unobtrusively in the background. Also, there are sections where Gaby discusses nutrition and general fitness with an outside expert. The picture is said to be widescreen yet does not give a ratio, though I would say it's about 1.78:1, and is quite a sharp picture even on my high-definition TV. The main part of the DVD, not counting the bonus section, runs a generous 73 minutes.

Actually, I bought this both for exercise and to learn Spanish, as this is all spoken in Spanish, with optional English subtitles. The bonus section includes recipes, a photo gallery of Gaby, and a sort of behind-the-scenes video. There is also a sequel to this,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mejorando-Tu-Vida-con-Gabriela-Spanic-Vol-2/dp/B000ERVK6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mejorando Tu Vida con Gabriela Spanic, Vol. 2</a>, which I plan to get but have not seen yet, so perhaps I'll let you know about it when I do!",1271721600,4,1842,5.136666666666667
