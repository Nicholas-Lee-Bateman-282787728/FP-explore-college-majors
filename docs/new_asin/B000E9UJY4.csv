8107813,4,B000E9UJY4,"SHORT REVIEW: This is an awesome movie if you like this sort of thing. It is a nice, clean  print, but it's presented in full screen which seems to be the only way to get it on DVD. If it were in widescreen, I wouldve given it 5 stars. These Australian Corman flicks from Umbrella Entertainment always have at least a few good extra features and such nice looking packaging!

That's all folks!",1265760000,,393,4.36986301369863
