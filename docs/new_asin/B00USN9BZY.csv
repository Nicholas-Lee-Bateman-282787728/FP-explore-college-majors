7071033,4,B00USN9BZY,"A very fun movie. I am someone who enjoys watching a lot of movies. I am definitely not a critic and just your basic movie watcher. If at the end of the movie I was entertained, I am happy. I have to say I did enjoy it very much.",1434758400,2,229,3.693877551020408
7071034,5,B00USN9BZY,"The film is not one you'll you'll see advertised a lot and that's a shame. The distributor - Stand Releasing - specializes in films that fly ""under the radar"" and, while not all their films appeal to me, I've discovered some nifty ""small"" films I'd not have found otherwise.

The core story of this 2013 release revolves around the big Eurovision song contest, which many in the US are unaware of. Not many of the winning songs make a big splash over here but some did. ""Waterloo"" by ABBA took the award in 1974 and there were a few others. It's sort of like watching ""American Idol"" but it's the SONG that gets the prize (and the songwriter), not the performer.
Anyway, four women and one (gay) man (important because he cross-dresses to form a female quintet) who all have different careers join together to enter as the official Israeli entry, when one of the women writes a song ""Song for Anat"" to cheer up one of the group (whose nane is - ta da! - Anat). The song was written by Babydaddy of The Scissor Sisters).

The Captain and Tenile's hit ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" plays a prominent part in the film too! And most of the songs switch from English to Hebrew. The film is MOSTKLY in Hebrew and there are clear subtitles in English. I will warn you in advance to have your remot4e control in your hand with you finger near the ""pause"" button. Israelis speak FAST and the subtitles have to keep up. So they fly by FAST. It's not a big deal - and worth the effort - but just be prepared.

I was disappointed to find that there doesn't seem to be a soundtrack CD released for the film. I did find that if I searched on YouTube for ""Song For Anat"", there is the clip of one version of that song there (part of the plot is also that the Israeli promoters what a souped-up version while the group wants to do it acoustically).

I wish that there were more ""bonuses"" (there is only the Theatrical Trailer) but I'm glad I discovered it. If you like pop music of the 70s I think you will too.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8708186,4,B00USN9BZY,"Perhaps not as groundbreaking as Eytan Fox's earlier movies, but still, an uplifting movie about the friendship that develops among a group of neighbors--five women and a gay man--who manage to break out of their ordinary lives to experience something extraordinary. This is an unmistakable homage to ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" and a welcome change of pace from the average Israeli themes of war, death and suicide bombings.",1459209600,,429,5.231884057971015
8708187,5,B00USN9BZY,This film was not what I had envisioned.  It not only had a very good story line with many romances all through out.  Take the one you care for and love so very much to see this very entertaining film!  NJMJr!,1454716800,,209,4.048780487804878
8708188,4,B00USN9BZY,"We meet a group of friends in Israel who all share a love of `Universong', which is really Eurovision. They gather round the flat of Anat to watch the show and Israel's answer is a kitsch car crash and gets the `nul points' treatment. Then after Anat gets all despondent about her failing marriage they decide to cheer her up by singing her a song - and to be honest it is rather good. Ofer is the only male member and he is gay. He is also in a relationship with a closeted frontman for a humus magnate (I kid you not) - who sees their home made video and says it should be in Universong.

Well quicker than you can say cheep wigs and glitter, Ofer has sent it off and they are selected to represent Israel. Problem is everyone did it for a joke and do not want any part of it. What we then get is the ups and downs of how and what motivated them and how doing something for the joy of it can bring great rewards.

I really enjoyed this film, it is camp, it is kitsch it is funny and it has some cracking tunes from Eurovision, including some you would probably hope you had forgotten. It wears its heart on its Lam sleeve and is full of colour and vibrancy. It is in Hebrew, French and English with really good sub titles and a run time of a mere 92 minutes. This was fun from the get go and it was always going to be a happy(ish) ending - so if a bit of Eurovision, camped up dream making is your thing then look no further - absolutely recommended.",1446249600,,1452,4.055749128919861
8708189,4,B00USN9BZY,"This cute and charming little film has five things going for it...

1. Director Eytan Fox. I'm a big fan of his work, most notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-on-Water/dp/B0009YVBGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk on Water</a>&nbsp;(in my all-time Top Five for sure), Yossi and Jagger and The Bubble.

2. Its celebration of the kitsch that is the Eurovision song contest, masquerading and very thinly disguised in the script as the UniverSong contest.  Look up guilty pleasure in the dictionary, you'll find a picture of Eurovision.

3. Dana Ivgy. Enough said.  She's a wonderful actress and gorgeous to boot. [She's a real singer, too, by the way.  She's released a solo album called 'Band Camp.']

4. Lior Ashkenazi's cameo.  He's Israel's biggest star.  He and Fox go way back (see 'Walk on Water').  His screen presence is magnetic.

5. The song at the heart of the story - ""Song for Anat."" It's super-sweet and catchy.  As a plus, there's no lip-syncing afoot here: these are the six stars singing their hearts out.",1445212800,,1072,5.430303030303031
8708190,4,B00USN9BZY,"Very funny!  Also a bit sad, a lot joyous, just a feel good story.  I didn't like aspects, but if you check attitudes at the door, it is a great story.",1443139200,,151,3.838709677419355
