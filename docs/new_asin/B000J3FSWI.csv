8462671,5,B000J3FSWI,"This movie is one of those after school specials released to VHS. It was one of the best made movies of the 1980's. The other one being The Canterville Ghost (with Alyssa Milano) which has also been released to VHS in 1986. If you remember seeing an after school special on TV and can recall the name of it, then it means you thought it was good, even back then. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the historic 1800's. A young Amy Locane does a great job acting in one of her first films.",1254787200,,496,4.177083333333333
