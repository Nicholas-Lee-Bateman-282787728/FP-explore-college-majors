3496132,5,B001BN4WFO,"It's time for new adventures with our favorite singing and dancing critters, The Backyardigans.  This DVD contains four more episodes from Season Three, and these are:

1. Escape from Fairytale Village: Tyrone plays a paperboy with a new route.  The thing is, his new clients include Austin the Wolf, Uniqua the Witch and Pablo the Giant, and they all want to have him for dinner.  If your kids know their nursery rhymes they'll love this one, and you'll like the bluegrass music.

2. Front Page News: Tasha plays a photographer with a secret super identity, and when a giant robot attacks Bigopolis she's sent out by Editor Pablo to get the scoop.  The thing is, how to get the picture when you're busy saving the city? Tyrone as Captain Bubble and Uniqua as Bug Girl provide superhero support to a background of Berlin cabaret music.  Best song: ""Cheese Cheese""

3. Le Master of Disguise: Pablo is Le Master of Disguise and is hiding on The Orient Express. Police Inspector Austin has to find him before the train reaches Istanbul.  Also starring Conductor Uniqua, Cowboy Tyrone and Tasha the Circus Performer.  There's only one sure way to identify Le Master of Disguise, and Austin knows what it is. This one is set to Nigerian pop music.

4. Pirate Camp: Uniqua and Pablo sign up for pirate training aboard Pirate Austin's ship, Camp Walkaplanka.  Lessons include the Heave Ho, the Swashbuckle and the Scalawag.  Trouble strikes when Pirate Austin is captured by the ghost of Captain Redboots (Tasha).  Can the trainee pirates save the day? Arrrrrh!  The usual four songs are set to the garage band genre.

Another fun and imaginative addition to the series, and a great gift idea for your favorite small fry.  Arrrrrh!

3496222,5,B001BN4WFO,My three year old loves the Backyardigans!  He'd watch nothing else if we gave him the option.  Some people said they thought this one was scary but it's really not.  It's super cute and they watch it all the time.,1383523200,,214,4.3

3496224,5,B001BN4WFO,"I wish they would come out with more new Wonder Pets DVD,s. I also would enjoy more new Backyardigans DVD,s.

3496225,5,B001BN4WFO,In the short time I own this video my 3 year old grand-daughter and I have watched it numerous times. She just loves it! I love it! Even my 4 year old grandson likes it. For anyone that loves Backyardigans you will really be pleased with this one. It is a take off on the traditional fairytale with a Backyardigans version of telling the story. I would recommend purchasing this video. It is adorable.,1318809600,,401,4.4324324324324325
3496226,5,B001BN4WFO,"My son is a year and a half and he loves escape from fairytale village.the music is very country, but its upbeat and when they start singing he doesn't take his eyes off the tv. This is one of the funnier episodes, in my opinion. I love when the giant thinks Tyrone is playing hide and seek with him. I think Backyardigans is a great kids show, but I wish there were more episodes that were this entertaining for adults too.",1309564800,,424,4.246913580246914
3496227,5,B001BN4WFO,"My kids love this show, they watch at least one episode every day. We have all of the dvd's to date, and have pre-ordered the next one coming out. Sadly Nickelodeon apparently doesn't put as much stock in this show as it does some of their other's, so it isn't on Nick Jr. as often, nor is it marketed as hard as some of the other kids shows. We bought the dvd's to make sure we have the shows to watch when my kids want to watch them, not at the mercy of the Nickelodeon scheduling. Of course, they are great for those long road trips, too.",1264982400,,541,4.065420560747664
3496228,5,B001BN4WFO,"My kids LOVE the Backyardigans, and this is a great DVD.  For whatever reason they don't care for Pirate Camp, but the other three episodes are just darling.  We love to take this DVD in the car.",1257984000,,195,4.243243243243243
3496229,5,B001BN4WFO,"We bought this for our grandson, but our entire family watches it again and again.  The first time I played it for my grandson, he and I danced to the songs - which, thanks to replaying the DVD, meant I was dancing with him for around 2 hours!  Fun exercise. lol  The stories have many levels that our 19-month-old grandson will keep discovering as he grows. He already copies some of the storylines during his playtime.  It's wonderful that the show inspires his imagination!",1235779200,2,476,4.630952380952381
3496230,4,B001BN4WFO,"My kids own all of the Backyardigan videos.  Fairytale Village is scarier than most.  Even my 5-year old says it's scary (although my children are more sensitive to this than most), but my 3-year old son won't watch the first video on the movie (with the witch, the big-bad wolf and the giant).  Probably better for ages 5 and up, but still very entertaining!",1234051200,3,359,4.578125
3496251,3,B001BN4WFO,"This is probably my least favorite movie out of the six we own. I find that after just one play through I am already tired of movie.  It does not get a repeat playing in a day.

My daughter disagrees with me, she loves this almost more than all the others and asks for this only behind Mighty Knights.  She especially enjoys the first episode, singing along with the characters and dancing to the music.

For me the score would have been two stars, she would pick four, so we gave it a three.",1233705600,,492,4.202127659574468
3496252,5,B001BN4WFO,My daughter loves the Backyardigans and she really enjoys this dvd.  It has a nice feature to play all 4 shows at once.,1231200000,2,119,4.173913043478261
3496253,1,B001BN4WFO,Never received...have been trying to get Amazon to help me for a couple of weeks...,1227571200,,83,4.6
3496254,5,B001BN4WFO,"My son, who is 5 years old, has always loved the Backyardigans and this one is a winner. It has a lot of fun action and very entertaining dancing. My daughter, who is his twin, also gets caught up in the singing and dancing. The children put on a show themselves. Then they will act out the episodes after watching the dvd. It's so much fun to watch them. I'm hoping a Backyardigan Christmas dvd comes out befor the Holiday. I know it would be a big hit with the children and parents.",1227312000,2,484,4.21505376344086

So this was great instead of her watching in one YouTube she now owns her copy. It has some of my favorite episodes as well such title episode, Front Page News, Le Master of Disguise, & Pirate Camp ever. It's money well spent, and I get to her hopping around and going ""Arrr"".",1486339200,,454,4.404761904761905
