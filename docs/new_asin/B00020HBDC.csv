8019517,5,B00020HBDC,This is the final volume of the series Heat guy J. Now I know it says it is a 4 disc version but it is only vol. 7 (Revolution) and the box to hold volumes 4 through 7. I Don't know why there are posts for the first volumes here. Also note that the difference between the 1 disc version and the 4 disc version is whether or not it comes with the collector box.,1414368000,,360,3.8133333333333335
8019518,1,B00020HBDC,"Earlier review of this item is wrong.  This is not the first three DVD's of the series.  This is the Limited Edition Collector's Box II with only Volume 7 (finale).  I ordered this item based on description in earlier review as Amazon provided no information on what this item really is, or how many discs come with it.  So please, only buy this item if you need Volume 7 and you want the Collector's Box.  This box will fit Volumes 4-7 of the series.  I hope this stops anyone from making the same mistake I did, as I double purchased Volume 7.",1099612800,14,545,4.294117647058823
8019519,5,B00020HBDC,"This is supposed to be the first 3 dvds for the price of one individual, but for some reason on Amazon it is not. I'm not sure how or why they decided to distribute it this way at Walmart, but I am very happy they did. These are the exact same dvds, in the same cases. The only difference is that they are bundled into one clear holding case.

You can find it at Wal-mart, Best Buy or sometimes Sams' Club.",1092614400,6,406,4.012345679012346
