8400866,4,B003NE665S,A thought provoking documentary about autism .It made me stop and think about how this condition affects families and everyday life I take for granted. Would love to find out how everyone is doing now.,1490140800,,201,4.771428571428571
8400867,3,B003NE665S,"As an educator, this movie was a good overview of Autism Spectrum Disorders and some background information. It was amazing to watch in the beginning of the video all the statistics about autism and how the numbers of people diagnosed with autism changed so dramatically in such a short amount of time. The movie brought up a good point about why are there so many more cases of autism now. It stated that there are more expectations now in school and society, especially socially and in all aspects of language, which is a cause for an increase in numbers. Doctors, teachers and professionals are now also more aware of the characteristics of autism, so they know what to look for when diagnosing and making referrals. It was interesting to think about people from the past that as of today would fit the requirements for ASD according to the DSM.

The movie brought up a great point for parents and families that are new to the word of autism; check out and verify all therapies before you try them. It is beneficial to see which ones are backed and verified by the FDA because anyone can sell anything to anyone online at the present time. It is important to verify the strategies, creator, interventions, etc. before committing to any one type of intervention. It also brought up some great points about the strain of autism on the family, siblings, marriage, finances, etc. But it was also quick to point out that we can learn a lot from these children and adults with autism.

More research should be done as to which type of intervention works best for which characteristics of autism. It is also wonderful to think that there are schools out there that are searching for people that are truly passionate about autism to fill their teacher roles. The Vista School is something I have never heard of before and would be a good resource for parents in the Hersey, PA area to look into for their child with autism.

Overall this movie was an overview of some terms, possible causes for, and examples of children and adults with autism.",1413849600,3,2039,4.658333333333333
8400868,2,B003NE665S,This is not what I expected. It is mostly a  bunch of opinions of people who think that autism is linked to mercury poisoning.....I got so bored with it that I couldn't make it all the way through the movie.  I bought it because I wanted to learn how to communicate with people on the autism spectrum.  NOT HELPFUL WITH THAT!!!!,1372809600,,328,4.344262295081967
8400869,1,B003NE665S,This was  a very boring and uninformative documentary.  A large portion of it was some woman rambling on and on about how she theorizes that mercury is causing autism...with no scientific data to back her claim.  What a waste of time.,1362355200,,234,4.658536585365853
8400870,1,B003NE665S,"I found this autism documentary very boring and nothing you did not already know.  In addition, lots of vaccination philosophizing.  (if you have not heard about this theory...check it out)  Much better off watching PBS  ""The Brain"" and learning about autism.  (along with many other brain abnormalities)",1353715200,,304,5.382978723404255
8400871,5,B003NE665S,I saw excerpts of this film at a lecture at the local medical school and couldn't stop thinking about the families of autistic kids.  Now I've seen the whole film and found it fascinating to see the kids and their parents figure out how to accept and deal with autism.  I especially liked seeing the kids talk about their experience and how they see their lives.  Good stuff.,1316736000,2,375,4.485294117647059
