1047831,4,6305600937,"This movie I saw some years back and had been looking for it, without knowing the name of it. I saw it on vhs at the time and didn't know it was on dvd. But lo and behold there it was. It was a spinoff of Easy Rider, a classic I might add. And this one possibly in the same class of Easy Rider, in the years to come. The area of descrption, price, shipping,etc. It was all good........add this one to your biker collection.",1394755200,,423,3.988235294117647
1047832,5,6305600937,This is a excellant DVD I really liked it. If your into motorcycles; youll realy like this movie. You don't want to miss a moment of it.,1284768000,,136,4.074074074074074

1047834,4,6305600937,"I came across this movie while searching for motorcycle movies.  I had never heard about it before but being a lady biker myself, the storyline intrigued me.  ""Their journey becomes a quest of self-discovery and rebirth, and a test of their resolve and friendship"" (from back of case).  The movie is based on the actual lives of the two women actors who are bikers and did meet in rehab.  Riding has opened new doors for me and gives me the solitude in the wind that I need to heal and restore my soul.  So Me and Will was definately a movie I wanted to see.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, especially since it was an unknown movie...so it mustn't be good, right?  WRONG! There are alot of well known actors in the movie and all the acting is great.  A memorable performance is Grace Zabriskie as Will's mentally unstable mother.  It may be a low budget movie but that doesn't take away from it being a great movie. There are no special effects, stunts, etc. - just an honest portrayal of two woman who find healing and friendship on the open road. I will be watching this again and with a different perspective now that I know the ending.  The surprise ending after the credits is poetic justice!  BTW, someone was looking for a song from the soundtrack.  It's A Thousand Miles from Nowhere by Dwight Yokam.  [...].",1262563200,,1324,4.466666666666667
1047835,1,6305600937,"Me & Will is an excellent, vastly underrated movie, but this ""new"" 2008 version from Peace Arch Entertainment is a completely pointless dvd rerelease. It has nothing new added to it ; in fact, it has even fewer extra features than the 1999 release did. The only thing noticeably different is the newly revamped cover artwork image and title graphics (which now misleadingly make co-star Patrick Dempsey out to look like the star of the movie) and a retweaked picture which is now presented in a matted widescreen format. The image does look a little better but the sound is still mediocre and it's not enough to save this dvd. Like I say, I like the movie alot but it deserves better dvd treatment than it received here. Overall, I'm very dissappointed with this rerelease and will not be buying anything from Peace Arch again.

1047836,4,6305600937,"This movie was purchased to add to our biker collection. It was a little different, but all in all a good movie. I had no idea at the time, it was about 2 girls hitting the road on their bikes..in search of purchasing the Easy Rider bike that was in storage at an old shop somewhere. I would give it 4 stars and it was worth the cost and time viewed..",1206144000,,351,3.9577464788732395
1047879,5,6305600937,"this is a very good movie. it is realistic of real peoples lives where all doesnt necesarally turn out how you had hoped it would. b grade filming adds to the idea this could really have happened. if you like this, then the movie "" roadside prophets "" is definately for you!",1130371200,,274,4.288461538461538
1047880,3,6305600937,"Hi, I watched the movie recently on T.V. and thought that it was okay, but what I am interested in finding is the music that accompanied the movie!  I have searched high and low and can't find anything.  Please someone, if you know how I can get ahold of that song(now all I am is...) ALONE which I think the credits said was sung by someone named Josh Clayton, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know, I want it!!!",1121904000,,408,4.217948717948718
1047881,3,6305600937,"As motorcycle movies go, this one is okay. There were a couple items I thought distracted from the plot and weakened the climax of a movie that had potential. The in-your-face drug use was excessive and the fact that every character was either a junky or a wife beater was just too cliched. And the climax of finding the Easy Rider bike is so lame, it voided the complete plot of the movie. And why can't a motorcycle movie be shot at a location where the rocky mountains isn't a constant backdrop? How about making a move about the Dragon's Tail in North Carolina or Route 66 or anywhere but California? If you can find the CD used and you're a motorcycle die-hard like me, it's worth it.",1040601600,6,689,4.390625
1047882,5,6305600937,"I watched this movie when I couldn't go to sleep this Sunday night on Lifetime. Was almost falling asleep but the movie just got me bolted upright. It was just so ...poignant, or maybe it just spoke so well to my particular situation. I stayed up till 5am to watch it. And was just like ""wow"" afterwards. Hadn't noticed the title and asked everybody if they had a movie guide....finally called Lifetime Network and a kind person today called me back and told me the title. I'm buying that video.....and it'll be the first video purchase I've ever made!!!
Good for you, girls, for making that movie!!!",1024444800,2,600,4.616822429906542
1047883,5,6305600937,"The film, also directed by the two co-stars, captures the wild night life in many cities early on. I felt that the surreal nature of the rehab unit was on target. The on the road sequences ring true thanks to the experience of the stars with their own bikes.
If you're a fan of Easy Rider, you'll really appreciate this movie. Enjoy the ride. It's at least as important as the destination.
HINT: The surprise ending is well worth the wait.....",975283200,,443,4.481481481481482
1047884,3,6305600937,"Me and Will is a loooooooooooooow budget movie.  It's a girlie road movie which have it's highs and lows as they try to find the ultimate machine.....
The reason why I bought it is because DOGSTAR play a song at the beginning.....
Keanu Reeves plays bass in Dogstar.  They were good for the 30 seconds they were on film.
I watched the rest of the movie ~ a bit too depressing for me...",973987200,,385,4.260273972602739
1047885,4,6305600937,"My wife and I, both avid riders, enjoyed this movie very much. We have seen it twice. I normally do not purchase movies, and of the very few I would consider, this will be one, (as soon as the price drops)! You get  something different out of it each time. The women who starred in it do a  wonderful, convincing job of the characters they portray. At times, it  seems almost like a documentary in its reality. No Hollywood BS or hype in  this film! What an independent should be! Anyway, my wife and I hope we  will be seeing more from Melissa and Sherrie in the very near future. These  two women are what independent film makers are all about.",960940800,11,646,4.297520661157025

I have to say I was very intrigued by the story,  and my boyfriend and I neither one said a word during the whole movie.  After it was over, the only thing to say was ""wow"".  I think it  is one of the best movies he and I have seen in the last year.  In fact,  I'm ordering the DVD -- and Melissa, you are credited on that page!",950745600,3,498,3.8613861386138613

1047888,4,6305600937,"SEEING THE COVER ON THIS VIDEO MADE ME THINK THAT THIS WAS JUST SOME POORLY DIRECTED BIKER FLICK. BUT, I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL, GIVE IT A TRY.  AFTER ALL, IF IT WAS TOO BORING I COULD JUST REWIND AND WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.  MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, IT STARTED OUT FAIRLY INTERESTING.  EVEN THOUGH  I WAS TIRED, I KNEW THAT I WOULD END UP WATCHING THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  YOU  MIGHT NOT LIKE THESE TWO LADIES TO BEGIN WITH, HOWEVER, AS THE MOVIE  PROGRESSES, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF INFATUATED WITH THEIR DESIRE TO REACH  THEIR FINAL GOAL.  TRAVELING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE YOU WILL WISH YOU WERE  RIDING RIGHT BEHIND THEM.  BEAUTIFUL SCENERY ON LONG STRETCHES OF ROAD.  THERE IS MINOR NUDITY AND A FEW SEXUAL SCENES, BUT, THEY ARE PRESENTED IN A  WAY, THAT YOU WILL NOT BE OFFENDED.  EVEN THOUGH I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED  ...THE END CAME OF NO SURPRISE TO ME.  IF YOU ARE INTO RIDING THE OPEN  ROAD, ESPECIALLY YOU LADIES, THIS IS A MUST SEE.",946857600,2,933,4.458333333333333

I remember those days before the war started, when it was all about riding free, partying, and meeting new people, going new places. Hard to believe it's been almost 19 years since this journey started. This film took me back to that place, and made me look at it different. A breath of fresh air.",1507593600,,424,4.578947368421052
