2841524,5,B000QUEQ86,"One thing I absolutely love about the Avatar:TLA series is the fact that a 5-year old can watch it, and be entertained, and a 20-year old can also watch it, and be entertained. For us older folk, it's the hidden depth behind the four nations, and all the various characters. The plot is unique and complicated -without- being confusing, which in itself is a huge achievement. I highly recommend this series to anyone willing to give it a chance. I've heard too many complaints from people that won't watch it 'cause it's animated, or even because it's and american anime, and not originally from Japan. If you'll give it a chance, it will definitely hook you.",1188950400,12,659,4.689655172413793
2841525,5,B000QUEQ86,"Ok, I'd like to preface this by saying I grew up in the glory days of Nick. When quality shows like Pete and Pete, Legends of the Hidden Temple and Are You Afraid of the Dark? were a dime a dozen. Lately I haven't been paying much attention to the programming on Nick. My, times have changed. Sure, I'd watch the occasional Fairly Oddparents or Spongebob but for the most part, it was programming aimed at very young kids(as opposed to the young adult crowd in the early 90's).

Consequently, I didn't think much of Avatar when I had first heard of it. I thought to myself, here was another show jumping the anime bandwagon and made to look like a Naruto clone. I gave the show a chance only through a happy accident and boy was I glad. I was hooked on the spot. Here was the diamond in the rough. Here was a show that actually had a planned storyline with a beginning, middle and end. Not only that, but every episode has a significance to the overall storyline. This is a rarity in American television when most shows have character development over random situations every week but very little overall plot development. They lacked an overall story. This is what makes Avatar appealing to me. It's epic in scope and is not afraid to end a story when it's complete. Many other shows continue to drag and milk a series if it is profitable simply because it is too tough and costly to produce yet another hit.

The characters are lovable, and a new level of depth is reached in season 2 especially when we learn more about Prince Zuko(Zuko Alone) and his uncle Iroh(Tales of Ba Sing Se). A new character is introduced in Season 2, Toph, a blind girl who happens to be a master Earthbender but is confined to her home because of her parent's belief that she is helpless. She is a welcome breath of fresh air as it's always great to see strong female lead roles, especially one with a handicap.

Lastly, I would like to conclude by saying that Season 2 is a wonderful set of episodes. It is the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the series and us Avatards cannot wait for the final installment of what has been an amazing ride these past 2 and a half years.",1188259200,21,2146,4.386934673366834
2841526,5,B000QUEQ86,"Im nineteen and i frequently babysit my 8 yearold sister and 5 year old brother. when watching tv with them i continualy fall asleep because of the dull cartoons on disney and nick. But avatar is like no other! I fell in love with the characters and storyline. When cleaning, cooking, or doing homework i put in the avatar dvds for backround noise to keep me calm.",1187568000,2,364,4.447761194029851

Very rare in the many cartoons that are out there in today's world.  At times I find myself crying from some of the touching episodes.  BRAVO to the creators of this fantastic show.

2841529,5,B000QUEQ86,"I am in my late 20s, and I have to say this is one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.  I happened to watch it one day while flipping channels and was hooked. I have gotten a TON of my friends hooked on it as well, and the dvds for season one have been changing hands all the time.
  Regarding the show itself:  The animation is well done, often with beautiful scenes and accompanied by simple and beautiful music.  The characters have depth and complexity rarely seen in cartoons.
  Regarding Season Two:  This season is excellent.  A great new character is introduced (though actually many great characters are introduced in Season two).  The finale, like that of seasons one's, was exciting, fast paced, and EXTREMELY well done.  The creators put a lot into the finales and it shows.  The season finales have an epic feel to them, and often feature some sort of homage to Hiyao Miyazake, the creator of some of the best animated movies.  On a sad note, the talented Mako, who voiced Uncle Iroh in season 1 and 2, passed away.  His character is my favorite on this show, and I hope they find someone for season three that can fill his big shoes.
  I love this show and I know myself and many others are eagerly waiting for the premiere of season three. You come to care for these chracters and waiting to find out what happens is difficult.  Basically, this show can be enjoyed on a lot of different levels, by a variety of people and ages.",1182729600,150,1445,4.412878787878788
2841530,5,B000QUEQ86,"Season two finds our heroes after the events of season one, new characters and new plotlines make this season a keeper. I can't believe we are nearing the end of the series ark. Season three is said to be the last season, (which it should be, the story will be done after Aang learns how to fire bend and defeats the Fire Nation, better to have three GOOD seasons than six consecutive ones!)and what a show it has been! Kids and adults alike are flocking to their television screens to watch the adventures of these kids expand further, mysteries and suspenseful twists make this show great even for people older than twelve. The background track music also plays a key part in the show, making every joke, action, and plotline maximized to it's fullest potential.

I recommend this show to anyone with a sense of individuality, not worried about the fact that they're watching an animated feature.",1180656000,59,898,4.719745222929936

I.e. when going onto Book 2 disc 3, the previous disc did not include the Library episode (Book 2 episode 10), and neither did the 3rd disc, so I had to look it up online.

I do have a bone to pick with the packaging itself, though. My DVD set arrived with most of the inner clasp pieces (the circular plastic part in the middle of each disc indent that keeps the disc from falling out) completely shattered. Thankfully, the DVDs themselves were not harmed in any way, but now I have to be mindful about how I store it because the discs do slide around inside the case and can fall out when I open it.",1502323200,,487,4.236559139784946

That said this was originally a gift for a friend's dad who really enjoyed watching the episodes when they were on TV. Now he can actually watch them all in order! Later I even bought the whole series myself.

What is great about this anime series is that it takes on a series story and tells it with a great balance of humor and character growth. It does it in a way that the story keeps you hooked wanting to find out what happens next while keeping it simple enough for children of all ages can follow and stay interested in it. (Ooo look cabbages!! lol) Anyway I don't want to spoil any of the great story so I'm going to stop here and say that if you like animated films with some action, corny humor, and a good plot this is a good one for you.",1489708800,,835,4.122699386503068

2841854,5,B000QUEQ86,"This series is just plain amazing! I like how everyone is race ambidextrous, but still manage to touch subjects like discrimination and moral decisions.  It is filled with love, hate, action, romance, fun, danger.  literally a little bit of everything.  The artwork is superb.  The story telling is top notch.

This entire book shows the leadup to Book 3 and shows much of the change taking place in Aang, Katara, and Sokka over the course of the season. The book itself is a great mid for the series and really does set up for the third so well that if you miss it, then you will be asking ""what!?"" every 2 minutes or so.",1434672000,,436,4.022988505747127

2841949,4,B000QUEQ86,"I love this series! It is very unfortunate however that they do not have a complete avatar series collectors box, instead you have to buy each book separately.

If you are looking for something where all of them will look the same on your shelf though, this work but they have some problems. My Book 1: Water box looks great and is uniform. This product (Book 2: Earth) has problems with the Nickelodeon logo being off center and being cut off. Finally my Book 3: Fire has a Nick Symbol underneath the outer edge which makes them not look uniform when on a shelf. I will upload pictures to better showcase this soon.",1433203200,,616,4.451327433628318

The first season was phenomenal and beautiful (as to be expected), but then I acquired and watched the second and third seasons (the third I bought myself). Upon watching both, I have come to realize that tho the quality is great, I was, for lack of a better word, ripped off. Seasons 2 and 3 are all missing missing episodes from them. Rather than having all of the episodes, seasons 2 and 3 are missing episodes - only giving you 3 episodes on each disk when their should be more. Until this problem is solved, my rating will never ever change",1430092800,,650,4.516949152542373

It is difficult to get the cover on and off of the discs and in this collection (as opposed to my Book 1 collection) the discs are loose and rattling in the case. This makes it even more likely that they might scratch. Really disappointed in the layout, but the cover art is amazing and it hasn't stopped me from buying the show.",1430006400,,427,4.417721518987341

This season is spit up into four discs, each with five episodes. The fifth disc has the special features. I liked this setup better than Book One's, since there are more episodes to each disc, which of course means having to get up and change the disc less often.",1420502400,,472,4.314606741573034

It's absolutely fantastic, with complex, well-rounded, charismatic characters on both sides of the conflict, amazing world-building, and just overall excellent writing. Season two has some of the most heartbreaking moments in the series, and I would compare the ending of it to The Empire Strikes Back.

2842522,5,B000QUEQ86,"I can say anything about this show it would be that it is simply amazing.
Avatar the last airbender is a show that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. I first watched this show when it first came out on Nickelodeon when I was 12 and I loved it! 7 years later I've watched the entire show maybe about 6 times and it is still fantastic. From the characters, to the themes, action, animations, music and comedy this show is sure to be enjoyed by anyone.

First off, the story line is beautiful. It's about a 12 year old boy named Aang who is the avatar, the bridge between the sport and human world. He is the only person able to bend the 4 elements, earth, air, water and fire. Anyways, at the begining we find out Aang ran away from home because he didn't want to be the avatar, he wanted to be normal. So when he ran away, him and his spiritual animal, Appa, a flying bison, get hit by a storm. So to save their lives, Aang bends the water around them and creates an iceberg. 100 years later a water bender girl named Katara and her hilariously sarcastic non bender brother Sokka find Aang on a fishing trip down in the south pole. Within the 100 years that Aang was gone, the fire nation decided to try and conquer the world. First they do an airbender genocide knowing that Aang would have been born to the air nomads. Then they pillage and attack all other parts of the world. At this time, Fire Lord Ozai was in search of the avatar but failed to find him like his father's. In comes banished Prince Zuko, a trouble teen who was told his life's goal was to kill or capture the avatar in order to be welcomed home. Zuko is also accompanied by his uncle Iroh, a humble and smart old man. Within the three seasons Avatar Aang has to help defeat the fire nation and bring balance to the world. He makes friends along the way, some you wouldn't even imagine.
That's just a small intro to the show.

Throughout the show we see all sides of each charter, we see their good, bad and vulnerable sides. That's the thing I love, they all feel real too me. None are perfect and none are all that evil. Aang the avatar is suppossed to be kind and to help people but even sometimes he gets made and makes bad decisions.

This show is really big on the friendship theme and that's something you will see throught it.
There are scenes that will make you cry. I've cried maybe about 3 times throught the whole show.

It worth watching and you will fall in love with it. I sure did. I made my girlfriend watch it at the age of 18 and even she loves it and became obssessed like I am. Avatars the Last Airbender is a really fantastic show.",1419033600,,2625,4.2023809523809526

2842525,5,B000QUEQ86,I had so many feelings the first time I watched it through.  And the second time and the third time.  I will probably have all of the feelings when I watch it through for the fourth time.  I love this show and recommend it to pretty much everybody.  *possible spoiler* I was so worried about Appa for so much of it and I still get really sad watching it.  This season has my favorite episode of the series The Tales of Ba Sing Se.  It is touching and humorous and shows all of the characters growing and learning.,1418860800,,513,4.183673469387755

2842528,5,B000QUEQ86,"This whole series is amazing. It's very rare to find animated series with actual character change and growth, but that what we have here. All the characters become more than they were. Villains change and become heroes, all the characters learn and grow. The messages put forth: you are responsible for your own growth, forgiveness, hope, compassion are what changes the world, be true to your values and work together to bring about change. These are things that matter. Last Airbender delivers all of this, along with a great story and lots of humor. Everyone should watch this show.",1418428800,,585,4.91919191919192

2842567,5,B000QUEQ86,"Arguably one of the best animated shows ever, this second season is my favorite of the three.  The character development that the writers have implemented really pays off episode after episode.  If you are on the fence about this show, whether it be because it is animated, or whether it is because people have said that this is just a cheap knock-off of anime, then let me say this.  The Last Airbender is more than just a simple Saturday morning cartoon.  It is a show that beautifully displays human emotions such as sadness, regret, jealousy, and hatred just to name a few.  The animation is stellar, and no expense has been spared in the production of this show.  Give it a try and then post your own positive review!",1414713600,,722,4.558139534883721

She's never the butt of jokes but always manages to make others the jokes of her blindness jokes. By far my favorite character, in my favorite book of this show.",1402963200,,434,4.506329113924051

I made my boyfriend who majored in history watched it and he said each four nation is suppose to represent the Asian countries during WWII.  Fire nation represents Japan when it invaded the other Asian countries to become a powerhouse. I think Water tribe is suppose to be the Southeast Asian countries; not sure too much about Earth or Air.

But how it's created through children cartoon is phenomenal. This show depicts many issues from war, love, hope, despair, death, etc., and how essentially these kids have to make adult-like decisions.

My 9yo LOVES it, the silly humor is perfect for him, and he seems able to handle the more serious scenes well so-far. The humor is very well balanced to also allow adults to enjoy it. I can't get enough of Uncle Iroh!

2843067,5,B000QUEQ86,"First off, I will start by saying this is an extraordinarily FANTASTIC series!!!! It is awesome and BA in all regards. Avatar: The Last  Airbender greatly exceeded my expectations. When it first came out, I thought it might be catered toward young children and the good guys will be flawless and mean and annoying; boy was I wrong. Even though this is a ""family friendly"" show there is no shortage of action, great writing, great directing, awesome animation, comedy, drama, and very very good character development. The characters are relatable and three dimensional, very real and they are written as they would actually react, not like other shows that conform the character to the plot.

Anyway, book two is the most exciting. It introduces (my favorite and definitely the best character lol) Princess Azula and the plot gets further complicated and the pace really gets set at a great speed. Whereas the first season sort of lulled, like a sitcom (still great though) book 2, for the most part, moves things along. I recommend this to any fan of great stories young and old. This show really has a really cool Eastern feel to it, but it also has a Western blend that makes it relatable. Fans of the show will really get into it, much like DBZ, or a soap opera, or any other show you really like- you feel for the characters and are thrilled by the ride. If you haven't seen this show by now- you should watch it for sure.

The shipping was super fast, and the disc and cover were in great shape. It was mint condition and the painting on the DVD cover was pretty cool. Book 2 also has really awesome special features that the other books do not include. They were really fun to watch, not boring at all.",1397520000,,1708,4.55700325732899

The set comes with five discs, one of them specifically for the bonus features. The condition was perfect, and it shipped on time, so no complaints there. In fact, I was so exited when I got them that I immediately started watching! But as I made my way through the story, I noticed something:
There are episodes missing! The DVD's themselves aren't missing, like I said, it's in perfect condition. But it seems they edited out some pretty crucial episodes like, The Swamp and The Library. I mean I guess it's not a deal breaker (for me anyway) but I really like those episodes and I want to know where I can get them.

Anyway, it's an excellent product, but I thought I would warn you. No one told me ahead of time and I ended up getting a little bummed out. Also, If someone knows where I can buy the missing episodes, let me know.",1392595200,8,1107,4.271428571428571

I really like the ups and downs that the characters go through.  There is so much struggle going on in each of the characters roles.  A lot of the time I could relate to them and it helped me to better myself.

#1 Complaint:
The company that made this DVD should have written the episodes on the ACTUAL DVDs. It comes with 4 DVD's in the set so it get confusing.

Its use of eastern philosophies as a plot device is fascinating to my wife and I and the overriding values represented our great for children, though in this day and age adults could stand to learn from it as well. It is highly intellectual at times, humorous often always, includes an epic conflict, and some great moral challenges for its characters - overall a fun show for everyone! The creators used a real martial artist displaying four different styles of Kung Fu to make each bending discipline look unique, and the movements are beautifully animated! Besides that, it's just a great, well written story and I highly recommend it. Each season or ""book"" includes all the special features from the individual disc releases as well as some extras on a specially devoted Extras disc.

2843439,5,B000QUEQ86,"Avatar The Last Airbender is an animated series that aired on Nickelodeon, and tells the tale of Aang, the Avatar who is the master of all four elements: earth, air, fire and water. The Avatar keeps the peace of the world, and keeps chaos at bay, but when the Fire Nation attacks and begins a tyrannical reign against all other nations, the Avatar mysteriously vanishes. Decades later, a boy emerges from an iceberg, where a young boy and girl of the Southern Water tribe find him, and help him on his quest to saving the word.

Avatar The Last Airbender may be a cartoon, but it is still one of the best shows to ever air on television because of its masterful writing, superb musical score, and an incredible, artistic design, showcasing martial arts techniques that are not seen often in movies or television shows. The storytelling is among the best I have ever seen, with a lot of themes that children are not aware of because of the way the show is delivered (violence, warfare, etc.). This is not a bad thing, as it helps to show this series' effectiveness on all audiences, and the top-notch storytelling that gives us dynamic characters, very fluid backstories that are constantly revealed as the show continues, and the beautiful animation that creates a world that mirror's that of Middle Earth. Avatar The Last Airbender can be appreciated by all audiences, and deserves more appraisal. For one, the show needs a Blu-ray release, and the official soundtrack needs to be released, especially since The Legend of Korra: Book One soundtrack was highly successful.

Avatar The Last Airbender is a must-own for anyone who loves and/or appreciates good storytelling, character-driven TV shows, family-friendly cartoons, sci-fi/fantasy or action/comedy. An instant classic, this show.",1378512000,,1789,5.0

The only other problem I encountered was that some of the discs were terribly smudged to the point that I could not clean them myself.

2843589,5,B000QUEQ86,"Aang, the young airbending Avatar, along with his companions Katara and Sokka, continue their journey throughout the world so Aang can master the elements and reunite the nations. Let's remind ourselves of what we're watching, shall we?

In this world, people known as benders have the ability to control one of the four elements. The Avatar, a living manifestation of the spirit of the Earth, has the ability to control all four elements, and has the duty of keeping the balance between all benders. As stated in the intro, the four nations (Air Nomads, Fire Nation, the Northern and Southern Water Tribes, and the Earth Kingdom) once all lived in harmony. The ambitious Fire Lord Sozin launced an attack on the other nations, and just when the world truly needed the Avatar, he vanished from existence. One hundred years have passed and two Water Tribe siblings (Katara, the last waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe, and her brother Sokka, a non-bender) discover and awaken the long missing Avatar, a twelve year old airbender named Aang, and his flying sky-bison, Appa.

In the time Aang has been dormant, the Fire Nation have continued their campaign to rule over all nations. All Southern waterbenders aside from Katara have been killed or incarcerated; a large amount of the Earth Kingdom has been occupied by their forces; and due to the now deceased Sozin knowing that the next Avatar was destined to be an airbender, the Air Nomads have been completely wiped out, leaving Aang the last of his kind. He has no time to grieve though, because an event known as Sozin's Comet is soon going to pass by the land. The firebenders are going to harness the power from this comet to make their final strike and officially be in control of all nations. Aang must master the other three elements and defeat the current Fire Lord, Ozai.

In this volume, the Gaang have moved on from the Northern Water tribe and are heading to the Earth Kingdom so Aang can find an earthbending teacher. There is a new antagonist in the form of Azula, Zuko's much more cunning and deadly sister. Along with Ty Lee, a girl who is a master in the self taught method of chi-blocking, and Mai, a deadpanning knife thrower, Azula promises to succeed where her brother failed. Zuko and Iroh's alliances shift when they are officially declared enemies of the Fire Nation, forcing them into hiding; in the process, they also learn the true effect the Fire Nation has had on the other three nations. A new member of the Gaang makes an entrance in the form of Toph Beifong, a blind twelve year old earthbending master. Toph rebels against her noble upbringing by moonlighting as The Blind Bandit, the reigning champion in the (literally) underground Earth Rumble tournament. After a series of fate changing circumstances, Toph becomes Aang's earthbending teacher, putting him one step closer on the road to defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

Along with all of Book Two, this dvd set also includes interviews, ""The Essence of Bending"" with Bryan and Sifu Kisu, the super deformed shorts, and the canon ""Escape From The Spirit World"" animated graphic novel that takes place between ""The Crossroads of Destiny"" and ""The Awakening"".

Avatar has always been near and dear to my heart, and will continue to be so in the future. I've always found myself identifying most with Toph. She knows what her duty is to her family, but knows that traveling with Aang will be better for her in the long run, and thusly ""sticks it to the man."" She doesn't take no for an answer and always does things the Toph Way and nobody else's. Also, when I was a young girl growing up watching this, I was quite the tomboy, so it was great to see a character who relished the feeling of earth underneath her feet and didn't want to be bothered with silly girly things.

There's also the extremely touching ""Tales of Ba Sing Se"" episode. In it, we get a closer look at the lives of Katara, Toph, Iroh, Aang, Momo, Zuko, and Sokka as they go about their daily lives in Ba Sing Se. While some, like Aang's, are more on the lighthearted side, you are truly a heartless soul if you do not shed a tear at ""The Tale of Iroh"".

2843731,5,B000QUEQ86,"Season 2 of Avatar is, I think even better then the first. More episodes or parts of one, are devoted towards other characters besides Aang and I think that really helped the show. Zuko alone and Oppa's last days are I think two of the shows best episodes and really helped me grow to like Zuko (whom I felt had a better purpose in season 1) and Suki (who, I also felt there was more to).

Now that Aang acts less immature and only unsure, I can appreciate the fact he is the Avatar and what he is going through. The choice he makes at the end of the season is a tough one, and that time there is no right answer. Katara and Sooki are much better to watch this season. The addition of Tou (can't get it right) was a great move. A character who felt unappreciated and who wants to be something (sort of the counterpart to Aang who at first, wanted to be normal).

The changes of athmosphere, mood, villains who actually feel threatening and the clever hiding of the true villains face, all come together to make a much better and fuller season then the first. I egerly look forward to viewing season 3.",1356652800,,1101,4.2631578947368425

This is second season which continues the journey of Aang and friends through the earth kingdom (hence Book 2: Earth), always getting closer to the epic final encounter with the Fire Lord.
Be sure to watch the episodes, and seasons for that matter, in order as they do tell a story from beginning to end, not like some cartoons where you can just pick up anywhere. Although you could do that too, but characters from early on are referenced in later episodes and the show makes some ""in"" jokes you may not catch, and therefore not fully enjoy if you skip ahead. I fully recommend this to children and adults.

Even if you don't like animation as such, remember:  It is a medium not a genre. You do yourself a disservice by skipping this one.",1355097600,,834,4.503311258278146

2843766,3,B000QUEQ86,"There's more than enough reviews to show why A:TLA is such an awesome series. However, I'm only here to tell you how I feel about the DVD collection itself.

I honestly feel that this compilation set isn't up to par with standard DVDs. The picture and audio transfer is sloppy; the quality is just bad. There are moments when the smooth animation breaks into digitized lines, as if a bad internet stream. The audio doesn't seem to be mastered quite well. It's okay, but it registers in a tinny area.

I really dislike the fact that it takes forever to skip the Nickelodeon advertisements for every disc. The chapter selection is very basic--separating only episodes. You can't jump past the opening intro, or even halfway into an episode, making it difficult to resume a chapter or find favorite spots. I also can't believe there are no subtitles at all.

The quality along with missing a lot of basic features for a DVD these days, it's nearly a deal breaker for me. I've been longing to own this series, and there's still no word of a blu-ray release. If it weren't for the great deal that I got for the set(s), then I would have returned them in a heartbeat.",1345161600,2,1161,4.545454545454546

When people long for the good old days of movies, television or even storytelling in general and they say that the best is behind us, point them to this series and rest assured that all such longing will be erased.

2843849,5,B000QUEQ86,"I was first introduced to Avatar: The Last Airbender by seeing the less-than-stellar live action movie (I did like many parts of it, but there were just some things that I couldn't enjoy). Despite that movie's deficiencies, I was very curious and started catching episodes on television. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode that I saw and found the series to be fun, hilarious, full of heart, of very high quality, and very mature for a children's series (while still being very appropriate for children). So I decided that I'd rather see all of the episodes in order and ordered the first season. I wasn't delighted to see how well the series flowed and how wonderful the character development is.

This second season is perhaps my favorite out of the three. It has incredible episodes and expands greatly upon everything from the first season. The story goes deeper, the characters grow further, and it's a great experience to watch.

I have not yet viewed all of the extras for this season but I have listened to the episode commentaries, which are a lot of fun and very informative.

Overall this is one of my favorite television series...I was surprised by just how well done this series is and I would recommend it to anyone, child or adult.",1306886400,,1246,4.7592592592592595

By the time my family finished watching all three books, I wanted to rate this more than five stars. The stories are excellent, creative, inventive, unpredictable, funny, serious and tie together very well. I've never owned any show that I've loved so much and is so endearing.  The messages of this show are very wholesome.  My family stayed up until midnight to finish the last book.

It's a cartoon, but the stories and content are so much better than any movie/tv show I've ever seen.  If there is one thing that could be improved it would be to make it higher resolution 16:9 instead of 4:3.",1295913600,,762,4.338028169014085

2843902,5,B000QUEQ86,"I first stumbled upon Avatar the Last Airbender during its season one run on Nickelodeon.  It then seemed to disappear.  Years later i rediscovered it, in its entirety, on nicktunes tv.  Having grown up on nicktunes, i could honestly say that this series surprised me a little bit.  It seamlessly combines elements of action, humor, and animation that we crave as children, and that still many of us appreciate as adults.  Book 2 has always been my favorite of the 3 unbelievable seasons of Avatar.  It continues the perilous journey of our trio of heroes Aang, Katara, and Sokka, as they journey through the earth nation in hopes of discovering a means for Aang to achieve his destiny of mastering all four elements (which includes the edition of a salty fourth member of Team Avatar or Team Boomer-Aang) as well as a means to defeat the destructive fire nation.  This Season also follows the side adventures of Uncle Iroh and his disgraced Nephew, Prince Zuko, as they try to evade the fire nation along with our heroes, especially Zuko's sister Azula (who we were introduced to at the end of season 1).  The action is even better than season 1 and the storylines are as rock solid as the title implies they should be.  Love and allegiances are tested before everything comes to ahead in the SHOCKING season 2 finale.

As for the special features of this package, anyone who has experience with avatar on dvd can tell you that sometimes the commentary by the creators is even better than the show.  They truly are brilliant producers and their explanations as to why things are done a certain way are enlightening to say the least.  They even included a special version of the first episode which is told in storyboard form, with the finished product as an inlay on screen

Book 2 is Earth.  And it is the foundation of the series.  Season one got me interested in the series but season 2 made me a fan.  If you enjoyed the first season you will love season 2 as well.",1290902400,,1970,4.585714285714285

The storytelling, the characters, the humor, the action, all come together to create this gem. My 4-year son and I are hooked, we're halfway thru ""Book 3: Fire"" and I'm already saddened by the idea of it ending. But end it will, and in a sense this is a good thing, as it will give the series a satisfying closure, avoiding the dragging on that happens to many TV shows. It will feel like finishing a good book.

Season 2 gets really interesting and that's saying a lot since Season 1 was already so captivating.  The characters really show a lot of growth and the plot gets more exciting as well as interesting.  In the midst of all the entertainment, there are some amazing life lessons.  Family, political, and cultural dynamics continue to play a huge role in this season and one can't help but appreciate how much is there while kids probably don't even realize how much they are learning.
.
As I mentioned in my review of a season 1 set, this is not just sitting on the shelf looking pretty.  I watch this series quite a bit.  Sometimes something comes up in conversation with my daughter or a friend and I'll pull the set off the shelf so we can watch it and settle the matter.  I have used episode 19, The Guru, of this season to show people about Chakras since it's so well explained.  Other times I just watch the series from the beginning because I feel like it.

2843948,5,B000QUEQ86,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is an amazing cartoon that anyone regardless of age can enjoy.  Lots of people have already given detailed summaries so long story short the Avatar Aang and his friends Katara and Sokka continue their quest to save the world from the fire nation.  Now Aang must learn earthbending and he sets out to find a mentor while danger lurks from all sides.

Mixing martial arts with fantasy, it's a story about saving the world and finding yourself.  The first season was awesome.  The second season is even better and takes all sorts of twists and turns.  New characters like the blind earthbender Toph or the crazy Princess Azula add depth to the series.  The show heats up with extra action.  While the spirit of the show is always light hearted and kid-friendly, the story takes a darker turn.  There's always bad guys after the good guys, but this time the characters also deal with loss, betrayal, separation, inner demons, soul searching and new experiences.  And of course potential romance.  The added drama goes hand in hand with the action and comedy quite nicely.

The show truly has everything and it's characters are what powers it, from the villainous Princess Azula to the wise and funny Uncle Iroh, there's a wide array of characters that give color to the series.

All in all this season is even better than the first and I'm itching to see book three, which is said to be even better.  The show really speaks to all audiences.  Kids will love the action and comedy while older members (such as myself who is a 20-year old college student) will appreciate the dramatic side in addition to the bending of the elements and the jokes and blunders.

A warning to the reader, this is not a show to blindly dive into.  You should watch book one first so you understand the story and the characters before watching book two.  But don't let that get you down.  That means you've got twice as much Airbender to watch.",1281398400,,1945,4.6345029239766085

Avatar: the Last Airbender is based on the concept of the Dalai Lama, and so religiously I can't agree with its premise.  But it is internally consistent, very well animated, the characters all grow and progress (except the villains, who, you know, get what's coming to them).  It's a case of good vs. evil; good wins.  The characters use ""bending"" in cool ways.  Some can ""bend"" or manipulate fire, or earth (rocks and dirt), water, or air.  The ""Last Airbender"" is the last of his tribe, since the other Airbenders were wiped out by the Fire Nation (which uses fire).  There are several martial art forms shown, as the moves of each form of bending was based on a martial art.  The producers used real martial arts consultants, and while it most often looks like something out of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", i.e. wildly unrealistic, in the cartoon it comes off as cool.",1279584000,,1041,4.619565217391305

A few things we love about it:

--Multi-dimensional characters--

The main characters are 12, 14 and 16 years old, and they all have to make tough choices between what they want in the short term and what is right for the greater good. They make mistakes and fail sometimes, and it's not all about happy endings. Over the course of the show, you learn that there's much more to ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" than meets the eye. There's a lot to think about in terms of nature vs. nurture, as some character traits seem inherent and others are the result of past training or trauma.

--Strong females--

Katara fills a much-needed spot for female characters: She's independent and nurturing at the same time. She speaks her mind and makes tough decisions, and helps people without being stuck in that role. She's confident with her body's strength and doesn't fuss about her appearance, even though she's beautiful in a very natural and healthy way. Katara's mother and grandmother are/were also wise and influential, and are respected as capable women throughout the series. Toph is the world's coolest tom-boy and is strong and creative, but also hiding some vulnerability we learn about as time goes on. (I love this humanizing touch to all of the characters.)

--An exciting plot line--

The kids set out to learn the skills to restore balance and peace in the world. Love, war, roadtrips, etc. We're on the edge of our seats.

--Beautiful landscapes and architecture--

What's not to love about flying all over the world on the back of a 6-legged flying air bison?

--Thoughtful themes--

This storyline is much more nuanced than many simplistic ""good versus evil"" plots in kids' (and grown-ups') entertainment. The problem to resolve in this series is the lack of balance among the elements (water, earth, air, fire) that allows the Fire Nation to dominate the other nations. There's a lot to learn in terms of each element's traits, and how a ""good"" characteristic can be ""bad"" when it's excessive or absent.

--!Pure fun!--

Deep thoughts aside, this series is fun, fun, fun. I can't believe it's marketed as 6-11 years old. We all love it.",1266192000,,2316,4.818181818181818

I missed the 2nd season showing and decided to support the creators by getting the DVD set. Until the DVD was delivered, I decided to download some illegal copies and watch them (its not like I haven't payed for a copy to watch).

I really enjoyed watching the show - until I got the DVD box set: The video quality in the DVD set is simply HORRIBLE! the image is highly pixelated and looks like a bad computer screen. Both the broadcast quality and the TV rips I downloaded were much better quality. The encoding is so bad that it is painful to watch!

Goal 2: enjoy high quality legal video - Failed!!",1253318400,7,736,4.25
2844033,5,B000QUEQ86,"Simply awesome! I enjoyed the 3rd season of all the Avatars the most, largely because of the apex of the maturing story. The second season I enjoyed better than the first again as a part of the maturing story. But that aside they are all amazing stories that have you gripped into them all the way through.

They keep you wanting more at the end of every episode. I could not stop watching after an episode ended and spent a lot of late nights laughing, trying not to cry, and amazed by the artistry, the imagination, and the gripping story line. To top it all off, the martial arts are animated to perfection. I don't practice Kung fu by any means but you can sure tell the writers did their homework.

It also covers some of the most important high points of human life; Honor, respect, bravery, and loyalty.

If you enjoy action, comedy, and animated shows, don't miss this! In fact, don't miss it whether your a fan or not. After this, you will be.

Side note: The series inspired M Night to produce, direct, and write a three part movie series. High hopes that he can do as good as the cartoon!",1252540800,,1099,4.372549019607843

What amazed me most is the attention to detail that is put into the animation, from the way the wind moves Oppa's hair, to the wounds inflicted, right down to the way Zuko's scarred eye is unable to open wide like his other eye when he's surprised.

2844098,5,B000QUEQ86,"This is a show that just keeps getting better and better. Book 2: Earth brought us the introduction of Toph to the Gaang, which was a great move on the part of the creators. Toph is lovably deadpan and adorable to boot, and watching her train Aang to earthbend must be seen to be believed.

Another thing I love about this show is that I care about the characters so much that I cry for them (not something that happens much with me). An example: in ""Tales of Ba Sing Se"", Iroh mourns his son Lu Ten with the touching ballad ""Little Soldier Boy"". We don't even get to meet Lu Ten (except for a five-second flashback or two) and it still brought tears to my eyes. It's a beautiful moment that will surely ring true to anyone who's lost a family member to war.

This season also saw the debut of ""Ozai's Angels"", as they're called among the fandom. We get a new villain: Azula, Zuko's younger sister, and her cronies, Mai and Ty Lee. These three have been sent out by Ozai to capture  Zuko and Iroh, who are considered traitors to the Fire Nation. Azula is a truly awesome and terrifying villainess, obviously taking after her father.

This was a very good series and I would recommend it for the entire family. This show is so much better than almost anything else that is out there right now. Parents and children can talk about what can be learned from the episode they just watched.  Things like doing what is right even if it is not the easiest, most fun, or popular thing to do.  Things like repentance and forgiveness.  Things like sometimes you have to work to right mistakes that you have make.

2844127,5,B000QUEQ86,"I don't want to spoil any of this honest to God amazing series, so I won't mention any particulars. The grand story of Avatar is nothing we havn't seen before; A hero thought lost for a century returns to find that the world has been unbalanced and an evil empire is on the brink of total world domination. He is not ready to restore the balance, however, for he is merely a young and inexperienced incarnation of this hero, The Avatar, that has been eternally standing watch over the world and should once again, if Aang can get it together. Although the story may sound familiar the execution is brilliant. The entire premise of different cultures being able to manipulate different elements is genius, and the blending of eastern martial arts is done beautifully as well as adding an an action packed flair to the series. The characters are also deep and well developed, and you really get to know them, even the ones that don't speak. I was truly heartbroken when this series ended, because it had given me many good years of entertainment. As far as american made animes go, this is probably one of if not the best, but it's also accessible to people of all types and ages. WATCH THIS SHOW!",1219363200,,1195,4.562790697674418

Few shows can compete. If you are a fan of Kung Fu, if you love, or even just like, anime, you will love this show, regardless of age.

Season 2 actually manages to improve on season 1, bringing Aang and his friends ever closer to the final stand off with the fire nation. This season manages to introduce great new characters, Toph being my all time favorite, along with fights scenes that you'll want to watch again and again.

I mean, I grew up on Digimon and Card Captor which were okay, and then you had the book of Virtues that was good to.  But I must say Avatar trumps them all!  If there was ever a show that could capture the hearts of all audiences it is, Avatar, The Last Airbender.

Friendship, family, and honor never had a better representative.  Not to mention that I love when the seasons come out in these excellent boxed sets so that you can get the whole season without a billion DVD cases.  It's almost as fun as buying the extended versions of Lord of the Rings.  Okay, not really but you get the point.  If your hesitant don't be, this is a family fun film that you will enjoy again and again.  My family has seen almost every episode five times already and we're still ready for more.  We are anxiously awaiting the release of The Complete book three.  Even my Dad can't wait to sit down and watch it with us.

My compliments to the writers and the animators on their hard work with Avatar.  The plot keeps you involved and rarely slows.  Trust me, this is a purchase you won't regret!!  It far surpases Spong Bob Squarepants anyday.  I'll admit he looks kinda cute but that's as far as I go.  I could never understand a show that was so meaningless in its existance.

2844133,5,B000QUEQ86,"If you've never seen Anime before, this isn't it.  What it is however is a near perfect synthesis of east meets west, both in terms of Animation and of Content.  So much of Western Animation is episodic, where each episode does little or nothing to advance a greater plot or story.  This is serial, with most episodes moving the story forward bit by bit, step by step.  The four elements are western in design (there are five elements in chinese and japanese ideology, three of which are solids), but eastern in conceptualization.

Ang himself is very Tibetan, a reincarnated individual who's recognition as the newest Avatar (featured in this season) is remarkably similar to the way the Dalai Lama is selected (see Kundun for more about that).  A wonderful mixture of childish glee and world weary ancientness, he is everything Harry Potter isn't, responsible, hard working, and self motivating.  Plus he seldom whines.  Even his spiritual mentor, that wonderful addition to the Bearded Wiseone's club, Roku, the previous Avatar, is helpful and supportive in all the right ways.  If you liked Harry Potter, you'll really like this.

Season Two features my favorite addition to the cast, Toph, the blind Earth Bender, who's snarky attitude and general roughness is balanced by her vulnerability and carefully concealed compassion.

This is not just a show for kids, but rather for everyone who likes animation, action, adventure, and good old fashion story telling.  Its not too preachy, but does carry a good amount of moral lessions.  I highly recommend this show to anyone... and I bought all three seasons (well, preordered the third) based upon watching a total of two episodes.

2844159,5,B000QUEQ86,"Avatar is exceptionally written, perhaps the best animated series ever to air in America.  It's so good that acclaimed Director, M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN,(The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, The Happening) called it, ""The coolest mythology I've ever seen,"" and put his own screenwriting on hold to spend the next six years producing/directing a BIG-SCREEN LIVE-ACTION TRILOGY of this story.

Adults may find the occasional comic relief a bit cheesy, but will love the character development, psychological depth, mythos, realistic martial arts, ""special effects"", and the excellent insights into Asian philosophy, sociology, and mythology, and even politics. I've been studying Asian culture and philosophy and teaching in Asia for years and I've gained insights from this series because the writers have found ways to introduce and explain Asian thought so simply that even kids can ""get it"". Ideas like chakras, Daoism, and Chinese philosophy of the balance and properties of the natural Elements are brought to life and illustrated in the characters lives, situations, and cultural settings.  I bought this to watch my nephews (though I often watch it when they're not here too) and I think it's awesome because as they grow up in an increasingly Asian world, I think what they were exposed to in this show will make Asian culture (Chinese, Tibetan, Japanese, Indian, Korean)  much more accessible and comprehensible to them than it was to me when I studied it.

Don't the the animation fool you, this series is an epic ""reluctant hero quest"" myth of exceptional crafting, on par with STAR WARS and LORD OF THE RINGS.

Often fun and funny, it also has a heavier more mature side to the series which approaches topics like a death of a loved one, personal loss, betrayal, growth, and that people (even villains) have several facets of their personality.

2844189,5,B000QUEQ86,"I got sick of pre-presidential politics on CNN, MSNBC and FOX. I'd watch Nick to clear my mind of the same old lies and exaggerations I'd hear, when I discovered ""AVATAR the LAST AIR BENDER,"" on Nickolodean  That was it, I was hooked on the story line and the extremely complex characters. This without exaggeration is one of the best epic cartoons (I almost shudder to label it a cartoon) it's more of a ""HOW TO"" for parent who want to teach their children, morals, ethics, and dealing in real life decisions, with all the barriers they'll face as young adults.

I'm a nurse educator in my late 50's and even I enjoy this work almost as much as Shakespeare's works.  It's so well written with as many twists, turns and bi-phasic characters as King Lear or the War of the Roses have, (the REAL ONE, not the one in which Danny De Vito played.)

I'd hope Nick or some other very smart producer will pick up these characters and this story line, making it into a 3 or even 4 part epic movie series. I have a feeling its moral values will outweigh anything that the Harry Potter series had!

All I can say is, it's an amazingly executed story, excellently written as a role model for any kid or even young adult in today's very convoluted world of good vs bad and the extreme blurring between the two.
It's outstanding and I for one will recommend it to anyone: kid, teen or even an old geezer, who's tired of the real cartoons we see in Political Arena today..i.e., the ones with the Democrats and Republicians that are supposed to be reality. I loved to see Toph ""earthbend"" all the politicians and bury them in their lies, far, far under the earth's several layers so we can all sit and watch a real story of life, Avatar, the Last Air Bender.""",1205625600,3,1743,4.400621118012422

It's kind of like the difference between a Disney feature animation vs the straight-to-video sequels.  Or the difference between a Mayazaki film and the Care Bears.  The difference is most evident in the beauty of the individual characters faces and the detail of the action scenes.  Katara, Sokka, Aang, Zuko - all are somehow made generic and flat, as opposed to stunning like in Book 1.  It has to do with the colouring and the inking.  It looks like they cut their colour budget in half and doubled the speed of the drawing.

As to the directing, the combat scenes are very watered down with limited camera angles.  In Book 1, the combat between Zuko and Aang or Zuko and Xiao are so very good you can feel the power of each attack.  You can really FEEL what bending earth elements is like.

It seems like as of Disc 2 (Chapt 6), the quality returns though.

The storyline continues right where it left off, and it's great to see the characters evolve their personalities, skills and seeing prior characters from book 1 is a big plus.  The Avatar is all powerful, yet has a life-threatening weakness that is revealed, and the main nemesis from season 1, Zuko, begins to have doubts about who he is and what is destiny should be.  The action continues to be unique-new visual tricks and fresh attack styles just add to the excitement of a hard-to-predict plot.  The show has a perfect balance of action and drama and begins to introduce semi-complex background details, which adds a new dimension to everything in ways you won't see coming.

The only reason I did not give this five stars is that I wish there was a little more violence here and there.  I am not talking about beat 'em up brawls as there are plenty of those.  I am talking about death and showing it occasionally.  I understand this is marketed for kids too, but I am not a believer in sheltering kids from the realities of death in life.  I particularly think it is dangerous in a story like this, which is about war, to show little or no natural repercussions of that reality.  By trying to hide from children the realities of life we are only setting them up for a further fall potentially when they are exposed to it.  Besides until you understand and experience death, you cannot really appreciate life.  A lesson you don't want to delay.  As it stands though this is a very entertaining and addictive show full of heart.",1196726400,2,1283,4.550218340611353

I think these movies are great because Aang, the Avatar, has such great character and he is kind, wise, and has integrity. I myself am not buhdist, but I believe the honor they teach in their religion is wonderful. You get all that, plus the silliness of a 10 yr old boy all on one show.

2844264,4,B000QUEQ86,"This box set contains the four individually released DVDs for Book 2, as well as an exclusive bonus disc.  The four episode discs contain five episodes and a ""special feature.""

Disc one includes episodes 1-5, as well as an original uncut animatic.  Disc two contains episodes 6-10, as well as audio commentary by the creators, cast and crew.  Disc three contains episodes 11-15, and audio commentary from the creators, cast, and crew.  And disc four contains episodes 16-20, as well as audio commentary from the creators, cast, and crew.  Overall, I thought the ""special features"" for the individual discs of Book 2 were rather lacking.

The exclusive bonus disc includes an interview with the creators and M. Night Shyamalan (who is directing a live-action ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" film).  There is also a feature entitled ""The Essence of Bending,"" which includes interviews with series co-creator Bryan Konietzko and Sifu Kisu.  There are also three ""Avatar"" super deformed shorts (""Bending Battle,"" ""Swamp Skiin' Throwdown,"" and ""School Time Shipping"").  All I've got to say is, the super deformed shorts are rather amusing and hilarious if you have any knowledge of Avatar: The Last Airbender.  There is also the ""Escape From the Spirit World"" animated graphic novel, which are basically pieces taken from the ""Escape From the Spirit World"" game that could be played at Nickelodeon's web site before Book 3 started airing.

All in all, this set is worth it to get the bonus disc.  The super deformed shorts should be in the hands of any ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" fan.",1195862400,6,1579,5.05019305019305

2844313,5,B000QUEQ86,"This show is amazing. The animation producers have much more freedom and responsibility on their side so the animation of the actual show is superb. The fighting styles of the four nations are real Chinese fighting styles, and the main characters have their own special branch of style (like Tof or is it Toph, whose style is different from her other earth nation counterparts). The story is great as well. Another great thing about this show is that it draws many people to watch it. My cousin and I (both medical students) are enjoying this show. Unfortunately, some people are abhorred by Avatar since it is aired on Nickolodeon and that only children should watch it. If you are willing to give Avatar a shot, then stop reading this and start watching!",1193875200,,756,4.734848484848484

2844316,5,B000QUEQ86,"For my nine year old daughter the best show that has ever been on television is Avatar - The Last Airbender. In Australia, the series is broadcast on the ABC. The first episode of the season is aired well after the last episode of the same season has aired in the US. So while the first season was being shown here I bought the Complete Book 1. Those DVDs have practically been worn out they have been watched so many times. Book 2 has just started airing here in Oz, so I bought the Book 2 collection as soon as it was released. It arrived the day before my daughter's ninth birthday. For a week it was non-stop avataring on our TV during her TV time.

I have caught several of the episodes. Once again the team have successfully worked that miracle of producing a story that is entertaining regardless of the age of the person watching. Complicated emotional conflicts are portrayed in a way that children can understand while the humour remains at the slapstick level that children love.

The new main characters are excellent additions to the cast. Toph is brilliant. She is an excellent role-model for any child that is facing growing up with some sort of mild physical disability, whether it be themselves or someone they know. Toph, in a word, is cool. Princess Azula on the other hand is no stereotypical black hat villain. She is smart, ambitious, and ruthless -- not necessarily evil, just on the other side. This has given my daughter a lot to think and talk about.

I highly recommend this series to anyone with a daughter who is 8+. Katara and Toph are excellent girl characters; capable, courageous, loyal and determined. The stories are interesting and the animation gets better and better.

Now if the makers of the Avatar toys could just let go of their stereotypes and start making action figures of the female characters I know one little girl who would happily buy them all.",1193011200,2,1894,4.611275964391691

For too long have production companies removed B stories from Japanese anime because they deal with basic human emotions of lust and death and the personal effects of them.  While this series is still pretty tame compared with some of the anime that Chinese and Japanese children watch, it's still a step up from the confusing series that are migrated from Japan.",1192233600,,526,4.747252747252747

2844404,5,B000QUEQ86,"Note: This review is written on the basis that you are already familiar with the main story and that I don't need to explain the basics.
People hate Avatar for two reasons. The first, it's a cartoon that airs on a kids station, and people believe anyone who spends time watching kid's shows is sad and/or have no life. The second reason is (and I can't believe this is a reason) it's not real anime. It was written in America. These are the same people who refuse to try sherbert because it's not real ice cream.
Still, there is a very good reason that this series has gotten five stars consistantly from reviewers, and it's not because all the reviewers are eight years old and know more about hacking the iPhone than I will ever learn in three lifetimes. It's because this series has depth, character, a complex but easily followable plot, reasearched, and has yet to be corrupted by the likes of stockbrokers and lawyers.
Warning: Do not buy season two of Avatar if you have not bought season one or at least have a basic understanding. You will be lost.
Season two of Avatar, although richer and deeper than season one, lost some points for me due to the fact that you practically need to watch every episode in order to understand what is going on, something season one managed beautifully. Much to my surprise, buying the entire season on DVD solved that problem, bumping my rating back up to five stars. It was wonderful to see the episodes all the way through and see them all flowing toghether. The artwork is magnificent, and the research the creators put into their action sequences is appreciated, even for those of us in the norm (myself included) with a lack of any martial arts experience. The overall feel is a superb story blending comedy, drama, action, romance, and tragedy almost flawlessly (let's see non-cartoons pull off something like that.)
This set comes with five DVDs, four containing chapters 1-20 of Book 2, Earth, and the fifth comes with special features including Super Deformed Shorts and the standard behind the scenes features. The commentary on some of the episodes is actually pretty interesting if you have an hour or so to kill.
Final Tally...

DVD Features: 8/10 (I have no complaints, just that they might have added more stuff)
Endurance (as in, how many times can I watch this before I go crazy?): 10/10
