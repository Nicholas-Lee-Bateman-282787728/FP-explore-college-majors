In the film The Coffee Dance, it shows Estella moving into her new house with floors and good water and beds. Now some privacy, because she does not have to share one bed with all her children. The most important part, a bathroom is put into her house and Estella now does not have to go to a neighbor or relatives to use a bathroom. The seeds of self esteem are being planted. These women are Nicaraguan coffee pickers who labor all day, have high rates of breast cancer and other health problems. They and their children have been living in sub- human conditions of poverty.
With more help and assistance from Steven Hawkins and Gayle Nystrom, the women are inspired to put on a play This is their way to get out important information and to feel good about themselves. During the rehearsing of the play we discover much about their lives. The dignity that comes when they first get regular pay. not a lot of money, but enough to put food on the table and send their children to school.
There are many heartbreaking times. No easy solutions. However,as I mentioned before,seeds are planted. The women are feeling less like victims and are gaining courage to help themselves and others.
I found The Coffee Dance an inspiration.",1316217600,,1335,4.61344537815126

It will also make you grateful when you see even the improved conditions that the women and especially the children endure. Susan Lutz provides compelling videography and I can't wait to see what she does next.",1315267200,,378,4.656716417910448
