5855532,5,B00DTSYC1I,"I enjoyed this movie again. It has a certain something that kept me watching, although I am a fan of Renee o""Connor, that was not it. Possibly the mystery of her waking, over and over again.",1469664000,,190,4.305555555555555
5855533,2,B00DTSYC1I,"This movie is like an after school special, but for adults.  The ending was dumb after sitting through the whole movie. It's best suited for free viewing only. Only if you are bored and there aren't any other movies to watch.",1468368000,4,225,4.487804878048781
5855534,2,B00DTSYC1I,"Paula (Rene O'Connor) is an inspector for a historical society, looking for sites to preserve. She visits an old ship and parks her car under the proverbial suspended piano with expected results. Fortunately only the car is hurt as she meets the very personable Vigs (Larry Joe Campbell) perhaps the best reason to watch the film.

As her car cannot be driven, Paula opts to spend the night on the large ship. Weird things start to happen. Is it the eels? The food? The residual antifreeze in the water? As she sleeps she wakes up then something weirder happens, but it is only a dream. This goes on constantly until the point of viewer frustration.

Things are cleared up at the end, although they don't spell it out for you. Not really a horror film. Available on a 30 Horror Film collection.

8597621,4,B00DTSYC1I,"If you loveee nor like Renee O Connor then watch the movie . I was looking of some Renee movies , I got this . I knew from the first moment that it was a dream. She is not the talented actress in the world but her charming in all aspects in her life made me see the movie . For me I give 4 stars just because is Renee O Connor the lead actress.",1495756800,,344,3.6

8597623,5,B00DTSYC1I,"*minor spoiler warning* This film I believe was released in 2010 and now this is the 2016 release of the directors cut. I'm a bit surprised I'm only the tenth reviewer but I imagine that is due to this release only being here a few months. Certainly most of the viewers are not rating and reviewing this film. This movie is Starting Renee O'Connor, an American actress who's best known for her starring role in the very popular Xena & some of the Hercules series. Since the early '90's O'Connor she has about two dozen other film credits, she is an exceptionally earnest actress, something that is rather lacking in film these days. She puts far more of herself into her work as an artist and I've never gotten the impression she did anything outside of the fact that she wanted to and then enjoyed doing it. She makes short films on occasion that tell beautiful stories about life and make an audience think. In this film she plays a woman who becomes trapped aboard an old ship with a quirky caretaker who may or may not be a good person. It seems this film is suspenseful and makes a watcher wonder what exactly is going on. I really love movies like this. Much takes place in a dream state and it reminds me of times in my life I was in places under circumstances that I couldn't control and needed a solution to. Excellent acting, as I said Renee always effortlessly portrays her characters and she is very watchable and understandable. You see her and you think 'yep, that's what I would do and that's how I would feel and that would really freak me out and yep that's believable'. As this film progresses you wonder more and more what's real and how things are going to play out and if there is ever going to be a clear 'oh what's that aggh!!!' Moment or if it's going to be one of those films you watch and think about for months trying to put together what exactly happened. There is a level that this reminds me of The Shining honestly but its not really a horror flick. The portrayal of very real fear in the eyes of the unknown though... Ok so have you ever been in a room at night and thought you weren't alone for sure. Do you scream, cover your head and wish for a quick death? No... You freak out internally a bit and then get up and get those lights on and figure things out as best you can... And I feel like the goal of quiet suspenseful sort of twisty films like this one is to connect with audiences and make you feel like it could be you because nothing wholly unbelievable actually happens though that could I guess be debatable. The set is pretty cool and I'm betting they used an actual ship, no cheesy effects or anything. All in all it's just very watchable and while it doesn't provoke me to throws of hiding under a blanket and there are no coeds getting attracted by a masked villain... I don't believe that is the point of this film. Actually let's call it a dream state/ ghost story that honestly you could watch with your family probably. Let's assume you like this type of movie... You will like it. However if you're into big flashy high budget action packed flicks... Which I typically do not as I find it detracts from a story and I love a good story and just good acting and something believable or fantasy based, something that can catch you without spending a million dollars and all that... Then maybe you won't like this movie. So just watch it and come to your own conclusions and since you have nothing to loose but an hour and a half and I really liked it.",1476748800,3,3501,4.346564885496183

8597627,2,B00DTSYC1I,"Didn't quite get the meaning of the movie.  What was this all about?  Was it all a dream?  Seriously?  Who and what was Vigs?  And what about that creepy dude.  My god, what a confusing movie.  The ending really sucked - seriously.  It ruined the entire movie.  You don't dream an entire movie with characters and vivid places and happenings all in just one night at a cheezy motel.  Actually, it made me a little mad that I wasted my time watching it (and I can put up with a lot, so that's pretty bad).",1470009600,3,504,4.2105263157894735
