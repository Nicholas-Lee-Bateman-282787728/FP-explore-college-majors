7845990,5,6303365000,"The section on Noah's Ark and in particular the scientific reasoning on the mechanics of how the flood happened is incredible!  It certainly puts ""climate change"" under scrutiny.",1478044800,,178,5.357142857142857
7845991,4,6303365000,"Almost twenty years ago I bought the book ""Mysteries of the Ancient World"" with the label 'As Seen on TV'.  I wondered, ""why have I never seen this on TV?"".  Now I've finally purchased the movie and watched it all the way through and found it to be just as fun and informed as the book except you get to see more pictures and actual testimony by experts.  I'd recommend the book and the movie together.  Great stuff.",1364947200,,416,4.294871794871795
7845992,5,6303365000,"I was an extra in this movie, and so am partial to it :)  It is very interesting to me on another level though, as I am fascinated with Nostradamus, and one section is primarily about his predictions, the others are about the pyramids and the Bermuda triangle.  As a lower budget documentary I thought it was fairly well done and I enjoy watching with my kids.",1298851200,2,360,4.358208955223881
7845993,5,6303365000,This set does both sides with re-enactments as best as possible. After all God did the orginal ones and we are after all human. It more proves the Bible rahter than disproves it. It gives recounts not only of the Bible but I also tells where the ark landed with real eyewitness accounts of how they found the ark. Different people from different backgrounds all tell the same incident. One guy even went through a lie detector test and was proven to be telling the truth. It's all in there. If you like documentaries and you like the Bible this set is a must.,1282608000,,559,4.384615384615385
7845994,3,6303365000,"DVD WAS LISTED AS ""NEW"". PRODUCT RECIEVED WAS OPEN BOX AND OBVIOUSLY ""USED"" WITH SCRATCHES ON PLAYING SURFACE OF DVD. I PAID ""NEW"" PRICE BUT DID NOT GET IT. SOMEONE AT AMAZON NEEDS TO DO BETTER JOB OF CLASSIFYING. RETURN POLICY MAY BE AVAILABLE, BUT MY TIME AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO RETURN DVD WELL EXCEEDS COST OF DVD. ALL WHICH ONLY MAKES ME GUNSHY TO BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN.",1269993600,,374,4.434782608695652
7845995,3,6303365000,"I bought this for use in science class, but it is not appropriate.  It covers mostly religious relics, and 50% is on shroud of Turin.  It is great for the lay person.  Would be interesting for an adult Sunday school.",1229644800,2,216,4.35
