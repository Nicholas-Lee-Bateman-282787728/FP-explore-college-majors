7724053,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Tell you the truth, the music and the animation in the first video were much more better, i ended up seeing it over and over again. The new video did not bring the same sensation. However, i liked it simply because of its  ending. The new guy is better than John Smith. I am glad that Pocahantas  eneded up with him.",928972800,,316,4.163934426229508
7724054,5,B01DTNVGYI,Pocahontas is a great movie with fun and adventure. It is one of Disney's best cartoons.,927849600,,88,4.5625
7724055,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Okay, so I'll admit that the story is just painful.  Someof the characters, like the grandmother tree, detract from the story.  But if you look at the movie as a series of seperate elements, you'll find it's better  than the script makes it out to be.  The individual songs are really great  - Alan Menken did a good job with the musical aspect of ""Just Around  the Riverbend,"" ""Colors of the Wind,"" and  ""Savages,"" while Steven Schwartz's lyrics are really great all  around (except for ""Listen with your heart"" which was simply a  failure all around).
The animation itself was far more detailed and  generally just higher quality than all of its predecessors.  Only Lion King  and Hunchback are really comparable for going all-out with graphics.
With  all of this going for it, I don't see why people complain so bitterly.  Yeah, it's got a lousy story.  But it <I>is</I> entertaining.  And even in the worst of Disney's featured animations, there's quality to  be found.  Enjoy it for what it is.",923529600,,999,4.742690058479532
7724056,1,B01DTNVGYI,"This sequel is as awful as Simba's Pride was good. The animation isn't convincing, neither is the music. But compared to the story this is only the tip of the iceberg. Even if you have only LIKED Pocahontas 1, do  yourself a favour and skip this one. Although I'm normally a big, big  Disney fan myself, in this case I can just wonder who approved this story.  What the hell happened to: ""No matter what happens to me, I will  always be with you - forever!"" And now Pocahontas falls in love with  John Ralfe, unbelievable!",922579200,8,522,4.395833333333333
7724057,4,B01DTNVGYI,"I thought this one was a bit more enjoyable than Pocahontas I. The characters were just as interesting, and the change of location to London gave it a whole new point of view and sense of adventure. The movie seldom  resorts to loud and violent themes (as contrasted with such Disney  offerings as Lion King II, Simba's Pride), and left me feeling like a kid  again, hoping that Pocahontas III was in the works.",915321600,,411,4.527027027027027

7724065,3,B01DTNVGYI,"A very feel good Disney movie. Definitely not historically accurate at all (had to prove to someone Pocahontas was not in love with John. If he did try to date her he was a pedophile given she was only 12yrs old when this supposedly happened, and the point that the British actually kidnapped Pocahontas and held her for ransom.). Taken at face value, it's an enjoyable movie, but it does kinda whitewash history.",1517184000,,413,4.671232876712328

Unfortunately the digital version does not include the extra song: ""If I Never Knew You"".
Picture was great, sound was great and even if it isn't historically accurate, it is a beautiful movie in many ways.
Ignore the SJW haters and enjoy the classic film and maybe educate yourself on the real story too.

This also includes Pocahontas 2, which is a decent enough movie on it's own but no where near as good as the first.
The best song in it is ""Where Do I Go From Here"" which is actually quite good.",1501891200,7,637,4.308333333333334

7724098,3,B01DTNVGYI,"A good release of Disney's 1990's classic coupled with its problematic sequel. The original is a sumptuous visual feast, coupled with excellent songs and Disney's trademark happy ending even if the historical account was more bloody. The sequel isn't as good but it probably will be harmless for most. If you don't want to watch it then simply stick to the original on the disc. The disc itself recycles the older blu ray and DVD release extras and while they are good, newer stuff would have been welcome. I guess we'll have to wait for Disney's 4K release further down the line.",1492300800,,580,4.696078431372549

7724112,4,B01DTNVGYI,"There are better Disney movies than Pocahontas, I admit. But for all its flaws, it is my favorite. The animation in this movie is smooth, angular, vibrantly colored and stunning. Pocahontas herself is the most beautiful animated character I've ever seen. I will admit she doesn't have the deepest personality. For most other Disney princesses, it's easy to pin down a few defining character traits, but not so for Pocahontas. We know she's adventurous and spiritual, but that's really it. She's strong willed and also doesn't believe in or tolerate prejudice based on race, but aren't all Disney princesses since the 1970s like that? They're all known to be against prejudice that's based on class, race, appearance or species, and they're all strong willed. However, there is something that charms me about the young woman Pocahontas in particular, and i cant quite put my finger on it.
As for John Smith, I confess that after giving it some thought, the romance between him and Pocahontas is confusing. I could understand their falling in love after Pocahontas taught him about not being racist, if being racist was his only problem, but from what he's said early in the movie, he's murdered many, many of her people in the past. Does Pocahontas know? Can she love someone who has killed that many of her people? And the fact that hes killed so many is never mentioned again in the movie.
However, before that thought came along, I was very fond of John Smith, which helps with the four star rating. He was handsome, brave, rugged and smart, but never above being kind to someone who was weaker. He was quick to become a big brother figure to the kid named Thomas, was gentle with the animals he met when he arrived in Virginia, and the scenes with him getting to know Pocahontas were very adorable. When hell breaks loose, he's quick to do what has to be done, even if it means putting himself in harm's way to save someone else. He doesn't usually whine or cry about anything, he's generally a guy who keeps cool, and even when he was prepared to be executed, he was thinking of keeping Pocahontas calm.
On the other hand, when the movie starts out and he rescues Thomas in that epic way, you get the feeling that he'll be a great leader, but when they reach the new world, he's a pretty crappy one. His men, including the young kid he supposedly cares about, Thomas, are all hungry, cold and discontent and he's never around when anyone needs him. He won't admit to them about Pocahontas or try to urge them not to be racist till he's forced to. He leaves his men without any alternative to Radcliffe's leadership for the most part, leaves them to suffer and grow angry and resentful. When he has no choice but to stick with his men and help them dig to build a shelter so they'll survive, he sulks like a kid about it, making me cringe.

The soundtrack is gorgeous - I think Colors of the Wind is the best Disney song ever written. The score is thrilling. However, I do think I understand why the movie wasn't popular. It wasn't exciting like Little Mermaid or Aladdin. For my part, I didn't really mind the lack of excitement. These are movies I've seen as a kid. I only vaguely remembered them from childhood, but I guess that subconsciously I only expect to be entertained by them, not surprised, excited or kept on the edge of my seat. But for someone who was watching it for the first time, it would probably be a disappointment due to the lack of excitement in the movie. It's a movie that usually can't hold a kids attention due to its quietness, seriousness and its realistic, angular looking, non cartoonish looking animation. Also, if you know the story of Pocahontas saving John Smith (I didn't really remember it from history class), and you know Pocahontas and John are going to be in love, the rest of the story is pretty predictable. You already know the movie will be about racism because it's Disney. In fact, I saw the trailer after watching the movie and the trailer pretty much told the viewer everything of importance that would happen in the movie. Once you know it's going to be about racism, that they'll be in love and that Pocahontas will save John Smith, you know something bad will end up happening to cause Pocahontas to have to save him and the bad thing that does happen isn't something that alot of viewers could call terribly exciting. The movie is also very hamfisted and preachy, which makes it different from other Disney movies.",1481760000,,4471,4.602756892230577

Who could bring these visions to life better than the team of animators that create magic at the studio of Mr. Walt Disney, the man who created Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, Snow White, Cinderella, Pinocchio and a host of other memorable Disney animated characters? The magic of Mr. Disneys genius is forever burned in the minds of young and old. From the companys first animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs up to its current animated film Zootopia, that magic will forever be a part of every Disney fan.
In 1995 the Walt Disney Pictures Production Company brought to the screen its thirty-third animated film, Pocahontas. The film was directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg, who have worked on many other Disney animated films such as Brave, Aladdin, The Princess and the Frog and Oliver and Company, to name a few. According to the Internet web site IMDB, a database of movies and television shows, Pocahontas was the companys thirty-third successful animated film whose box office cost was estimated at $55,000.000 and grossed $141,000,000 in the U.S.  - doubling its box office cost in just the U.S. alone! (IMDb). The films G rating makes it suitable for children, which is always a plus, and it is suitable for adults who may want some respite from the violence that can be seen in much of their entertainment. Granted, Disney films hint at violence (usually someone or something significant dies in the film) it is never that in-your-face kind of violence. (Remember the kiddies!!!)
The films stars are Irene Bedard in the title role, Mel Gibson as Capt. John Smith, Russell Means as Pocahontas father and Indian Chief Powhatan, Linda Hunt as Pocahontas Grandmother Willow, and David Odgen Stiers as Governor Ratcliffe. Children probably won't recognize any of these actors or their voices but their parents will. Two of the films stars, Linda Hunt and David Ogden Stiers, have graced the small screen and have been seen on regular television series while its third star, Mel Gibson, has been seen mostly in action movies such as Mad Max and  the Lethal Weapon series. Irene Bedard and Russell Means are not recognizable star names but they are matched exquisitely for this film through the use of their distinctive voices. A very important aspect of any Disney animated film, voice characterizations provide much of the emotional contact one feels to the characters. It is the mixing of sound and image that makes the character believable.  We see this throughout Pocahontas and as always, impressions of people, places and objects have a huge impact on the viewer. The animators at Disney are highly skilled artists and it shows. When watching a Disney film for entertainment, also watch it for technique. It is fantastic to see the finished product!
Getting back to the plot of the film, the viewer finds that the film basically tells the story of two people from completely different cultures who meet and form a relationship that helps them to bring their respective cultures together despite their differences and prejudices.
It begins in London, England in 1607 where a group of settlers are seen setting off on a voyage to the New World. Men, young and old, leaving loved ones behind to venture out into the unknown with high hopes. They are a rugged, robust group of men and young boys who are without fear. Their goal is to become prosperous, by gathering riches from the land  to better their lives in order to enjoy the personal and economic freedom they did not have under the harsh and aristocratic rule of the English monarchy. The settlers endure the treacherous and uncertain journey of sailing over the ocean to the new world to find out who and what they would encounter as previous explorers had learned. The settlers are also contemplating meeting the original inhabitants of the land, Native Americans, who Europeans have deemed as savages. Besides seeking a new life, the settlers, who believe that the land is rich in natural resources, intend to take the land from the Native Americans to claim it for themselves. While the settlers begin plundering the land, taken in the name of Londons monarch King James II, explorer Capt. John Smith and Algonquin Indian native princess Pocahontas meet and establish a relationship that will bridge a union between the settlers and the Native Americans, thereby changing the course of history. Underplaying this encounter is the hidden agenda of Governor Ratcliffe, a failed English nobleman, who is looking for gold that previous explorers had found in their explorations of the New World. His goal is to re-establish his status with the aristocracy in London. He also plans to eradicate the Native Americans should they keep him from finding the riches he desires. The entire story is a touching story in human compassion despite its negative overtones of prejudice but it reminds adults and teaches children about a special event that happened in our American history.
In this film, Disney animators tells the story, as only Disney can, of Pocahontas and Capt. John Smith, how their relationship changed how both the Native Americans and the European settlers viewed and interacted with each other after arriving in the New World. Visually stunning scenes, beautifully orchestrated music, heartwarming songs, and gifted actorsall staples of every Disney film, bring the film to life. Watch how Capt. Smith reacts when he fully looks at Pocahontas as he encounters her by the river. He is completely mesmerized by her beauty. Her hair flows in the wind; her eyes glisten and shine. Or, watch when Pocahontas explains to Capt. Smith how he can see wind as it blows in beautiful colors and motion as the films main song, Colors of the Wind seeks to explain.  The animators bring this strikingly to the forefront using the tools of their craft. I could feel the wonderment Capt. Smith felt when he sees Pocahontas for the first time. She is not what he expected  she is regal, startling beautiful, mesmerizing.  This feeling is enhanced with the technique of movement which Disney animators use by making objects have flowing movement like the blowing of the leaves and Pocahontass hair.  The movement is flowing and beautifully colorful. Of course, a child viewing this film would probably think that Pocahontas is just, well, very pretty as they appreciate what is pleasing to them on a basic level.
Disney animators mainstay in film animation is that films were painstakingly drawn by hand replicating the actual movement of muscle and limbs, leaves and trees, water and streams. With the advent of computers, some of that magic has been lost. Sometimes you cant see the three dimensional filming process, created by Mr. Disney, where a scene has at least three or four backgrounds moving at different paces and levels to create a realistic view of action. But, when watching an older Disney film, you remember when these films possessed these qualities where they seemed to make the film real. The newer films have lost some of that quality but the magic is still there. That is what is so appealing about a Disney story.
Whether you're a fan of Disney films or not, one thing that every film reinforces is the power of compassion, kindness, forgiveness and tolerance. No matter what adversities the characters endure, even if they are animals, they shine through in the end evoking these characteristics. This is a lesson for children to learn and a lesson for adults to remember. Children are not born with hatred and prejudice and fear. They are taught this from a young age. I think Mr. Disney saw that in all children and made these films as a reminder that humans have the capacity of far reaching love. Sometimes they have to be reminded of that every now and then. What better way to be reminded than by the artistic medium that is the animated film.",1460505600,,8617,4.892539356605065

7724173,1,B01DTNVGYI,"I have always loved Disney movies. I loved and still love the Disney princesses especially. I am a die-hard Disney fan, and it really. It pains me to write this, but what I'm about to say is all true, sadly.
I just watched Pocahontas 1, because I saw that Pocahontas 2 was on Netflix, so my plan was to watch the original first, and then enjoy the second one, because I haven't seen both in a very long time. The last time I watched Pocahontas 1 was when I was, say, ten, maybe? I'm seventeen now. It's been even longer since I saw Pocahontas 2.
Anyway, I was all excited, ready to see a respectable disney heroine back-to-back. I finished the last one with my heart feeling very light in my chest after cooing over the sweet relationship between John Smith and Pocahontas.
And then I was like ""Oh, yeah, the second one!"" And headed straight to Netflix to watch it. Side note, I always wondered why Disney would let Netflix put Pocahontas 2 on the website, but not the first one. I now understand why.
Anyway, I started to watch it, and was surprised to see Radcliffe not in jail. I pushed that aside, figuring that King James was sympathetic towards the pathetic man and let him off with a warning or something, since crimes against native Americans weren't really a big deal back then. and then I hear about this John Rolfe and I was like ""Wait... Who is that guy again?"" Like I said, it's been ages since I saw the sequel and I forgot all about it. (I think forgetting it was my brain's defense mechanism or something.)
So, I was only like ten minutes in when I saw Pocahontas watching John Rolfe come off the ship and it all came back to me.
I was like ""Oh, yeah... Now I remember why my brain forgot this,"" and turned it off promptly.
Why did I turn it off?
Look, I can push aside the fact that the animation was worse, and the characters didn't develop and that they were totally OOC, but I cannot push aside the fact that they slaughtered a beautiful relationship set up in the original. I loved the original, and I love John Smith. As a little kid, I even had a small crush on him. I loved the relationship he and Pocahontas had. It was a sweet storybook romance.
But then in the second, Smith is presumed dead, so Pocahontas mourns him, at least, but then when she finds out J Smith is alive, she totally doesn't care, and at the end they just walk away from each other, when in the first, they were madly in love. Pocahontas saves his life out of love for him, for crying out loud! And then they just butcher it to make it ""historically accurate"". Screw history! I love history myself but everyone knows that disney movies are not meant to be accurate due to how gruesome history really is. It can be inspired by the Native American woman, but I wouldn't go so far as ""This is her. This is what the real Pocahontas was like."" And we already know that the original wasn't all that accurate, and neither was the second one. Why add the one real-life fact and just keep all the others inaccurate? Jeez, Disney. If you're going to be inaccurate, at least make people happy with the fact that it is. John Rolfe sucks and is so shallow and has nothing in common with Pocahontas, while J Smith is perfect for her.
Just do yourself a favor and don't watch it. Please.
My last words are ""Why did Disney think this was a good idea and who the hell decided it was good enough to be sold?""
Now, I can only wait for myself to forget that Pocahontas 2 was made so I can enjoy the first one without remembering the fact that J Smith and Pocahontas walk away from their beautiful relationship and that forever apparently means nothing to both of them. And I hope that I at least remember that the second one is a big no-no, but not remember why it's so bad.
It's a huge disappointment, and I think I felt my heart break when I remembered who Pocahontas chose.",1459382400,2,3853,4.315862068965517

He is looking to bring the leader of the Native Americans to England as an emissary to King James (Jim Cummings).  When her father is reluctant to go, Pocahontas volunteers.

What no one knows is that Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) has spread lies about what happened in the first film.  He thinks hes killed John Smith and convinced King James to take an army to attack Pocahontas tribe.  Her presence in London upsets him greatly, and he begins to scheme about how to get her discredited.  Will it work, or will Pocahontas be able to save her people?

Once again, there are issues with the historical accuracy of the piece.  For starters, Pocahontas was married to John Rolfe before she went to England.  And nothing I can find shows a plan to attack her tribe that she thwarted. However, Im willing to let some of this go as historical fiction and leave it at that.  After all, the plot is interesting enough that I was concerned with how they would resolve things in the last quarter after spending the first three quarters watching the predictable plot complications arise.  On the other hand, the plot does make King James out to be a laughable idiot.  He might have been, but this was something that didn't sit well with me.

The political correctness of the first movie rears its head again, mainly when Pocahontas goes off about respecting my culture at one point.  Hello 90s buzz phrases.  While there is an uncomfortable scene where Ratcliffe is attempting to provoke her, but since he is using it as pure evil, Im okay with it.

The problems with the film run much deeper than that, however.  Its just not that well written.  The dialogue is adequate at best and painful much of the time.  They always go for the obvious line instead of trying to come up with something new.

The songs are bland and forgettable.  Nothing will stay in your head after youve finished watching the film.  In fact, youll probably want to fast forward most of them.  The one exception is Where do I Go from here?  Pocahontas sings this ballad early in the film, and its beautiful.  The words aren't that original, but the music is grand.

This was done by the TV animation department, and it doesnt show the depth or artistry that the first film had.

And our three animal friends also make the trip with Pocahontas.  Theyre still amusing but distract for the overall story.

I will give the voice talent credit.  They do their best to make this movie watchable.  They are always believable.  While Mel Gibson didn't return to voice John Smith, I liked the fact that they gave that job to his brother Donal.  He does a great job here.

Overall, this movie is typical direct to home video quality all the way around.  If you like the first movie, you might find yourself enjoying Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World.  Otherwise, feel free to skip this one.",1433721600,,3409,4.570247933884297
7724231,2,B01DTNVGYI,"The Disney animation resurgence reached its peak with The Lion King.  The next year saw a movie that began to mark the decline.  While still a financial success, its easy to point to Pocahontas as the moment when things started to go south.  The thing is, the movie isn't helped by the political agenda hidden in the beautiful animation.

The story is a very, very loose interpretation of history.  As such, it follows the voyage of the first settlers to land in Virginia.  The movie actually opens in England as John Smith (voiced by Mel Gibson) joins an expedition to found the colony.  The expedition is under the leadership of Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers).  We even meet a crewman named Thomas (Christian Bale).  As we travel the sea, we get to experience first hand how brave and noble John Smith is.

Then we join Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) in the ideal world of uncolonized America.  Her father, the chief, has just returned from a victory over their foes.  His right hand man, Kocoum (James Apaumut Fall), has just asked for Pocahontas hand in marriage.  But Pocahontas is not happy with that arrangement.  She is restless and a free spirit, longing for adventure.

And thats when she sees the strange clouds that are the sails of the ship arriving.  While out scouting, John Smith meets her.  The two form an instant connection and start sharing parts of their language and culture with each other.  Will they be able to form a peace between their people when so many are clamoring for war?

Try as I might, I have a hard time separating myself from the bad history here to enjoy the movie as pure entertainment.  I will say that the songs are gorgeous, well most of them.  They certainly help advance the story, and I can get Colors of the Wind stuck in my head for days.  There was a love song written for Pocahontas and John Smith that is available as a bonus feature, at least on the new Blu-Ray release.  Why it wasn't incorporated back into the movie like was done on the last DVD is a mystery to me.

I must also give the film credit for the gorgeous animation.  This movie is a perfect example of why we must not let the art of hand drawn animation die.  The forests of the new world are so beautiful to look at.

And the voice cast does a fine job with their parts.  The Native Americans were all voiced by real Native Americans, who praised the film for the authenticity of the portrayals of Native American culture.  (Ironically, other Native American groups complained about the stereotypes.  Proves you just cant win.)

Then there are the animal characters.  They add some humor to the proceedings and the film is fairly serious, so I certainly think the film needs it.  And the way they parallel what is happening or should be happening between the humans is a nice bit of storytelling.

However, they are also a prime example of what was going wrong with Disney animation at this point.  They had become too formulaic.  In their efforts to crank out one movie a year, they went to the same well to create characters.  Dashing, virtuous hero?  Check.  Independent woman who wants adventure and won't settle for just any husband?  Check.  Cute animal sidekicks to provide some laughs?  Check.  Change the names and the setting and weve got a new movie.

So, now lets get into the history or lack there of.  I will grant you not much is known about Pocahontas until later in her life (after this film was set), but what is suspected is far different from what is presented here.  For one thing, she was most likely about 8 years younger.  There was never romance between her and John Smith.  And while she did save his life, some historians even protest that much.  Add to that the fact that they kill off a character who doesnt die during this time period, and youve got a work of fiction.

Now, I have no problem with historical fiction; in fact, I love the genre.  However, you need to adhere to the truth as much as you can.  In reality, this was nothing like reality.  Since the Disney version of things gets so engrained in our culture, thats dangerous.  Its one thing when looking at time periods but something completely different when real people are changed so dramatically.  And with no disclaimer to warn people that what they are seeing is purely fiction.

And don't even get me started on Grandmother Willow, the living, talking tree that gives Pocahontas advice.  In a fairy tale context, Id have no problems with this character, but again we've got that history thing going on.

Couple this with the other messages in the film.  There is the pro-environmental message contains in Colors of the Wind and the way the two cultures are presented.  The English are obviously bad for wanting to take resources and the Indians are good for wanting to keep them around to enjoy.  Mind you, I firmly believe that destroying the Earth is a horrid idea and should never be done.  But there needs to be a balance between the two sides, and that balance isn't presented here.

Furthermore, our villain of the piece, Ratcliffe, is a one note, greedy jerk.  And because of him, the only white man not painted with a horrid brush is John Smith.  I mean, look at the song Savages, which both sides sing as they are going off to war.  The white men are singing it because they think the Native Americans are hiding gold and are going to kill Smith out of spite.  The Native Americans are singing it because one of their own was just killed and they want revenge.  Which of these motives can you get behind?

Never mind the fact that Ratcliffe, while admittedly a weak governor, wasn't even in the colony during the time that the film was set.  He came a few years later.

Look, Im not going to sit here and say that the white man was perfect in our relations with the Native Americans when we came to this country.  Far from it, as anyone who has studied history certainly knows.  (Although the idea that we would all still be in Europe and the Native Americans would be living here in their idealic world with the exploring period of history is ludicrous.)  But the characters were created as strawmen that could easily be knocked down as examples of the good (Native American) and bad (white man).  It is so painfully obvious it ruins much of the movie.

Am I expecting too much from an animated movie aimed at kids?  Maybe.  Usually, I just sit down, relax, and enjoy.  But since this one took on history and messed with it so much, it really bothers me.  Besides, with the historical background and serious nature of the film, I don't see it appealing to kids that much.  The animals, while cute and funny, will only carry things so far.  Whether they want to admit it or not, I think this movie was aimed at adults.

So for the hatchet job of history and the blatant political correctness of the movie, I cant recommend Pocahontas at all.  Good visuals and music only get you so far.  If you do decide to view the film, make sure you think about the messages you are getting.",1433721600,,7000,4.523961661341853

I saw Pocahontas (1995) in the theater when it came out.  I don't remember who dragged me there, but when the movie was over I just sort of left the theater and pretty much forgot about the experience.  It's a mediocre Disney flick.  It's historically inaccurate, politically correct, and a whole bunch of other laughable things, but...whatever.  That's Disney for you.  Disney made Pocahontas look far different than what she really looked like.  Anybody who knows the REAL history of the Pocahontas story should realize that if Disney wanted to make a historically accurate cartoon, there wouldn't be much to work with to create an interesting story/movie that people will want to watch.  So they changed/altered many things to make the movie more appealing and interesting to watch (especially for the kids).  Of course, when people went to the theater to see it, they had no idea beforehand how many changes Disney had made to the real story (unless they read some reviews before going to see it).  As a result of seeing the movie, many people were angered and disappointed about all the changes.  Myself, I see it as a Disney flick - this is what Disney does.  It's unfortunate, but I laugh at it and then move on.

Overall, it's a mediocre Disney flick that I would recommend maybe checking out some time.",1422576000,,1424,4.782786885245901

Summery:There is a Indian princess named Pocahontas. She lives in a village with other Indians. Explores are coming to America to find gold. John Smith was coming. He met Pocahontas. They became friends. But when the other explores met the Indians,they want to hurt them. The Indians must protect themselves so a war started. Pocahontas must save the day. Or can she....

Message:Love. Even if John Smith was a explorer,Pocahontas still loved him. Also she told her father. That stoped the war. And John Smith went in front of Pocahontas father so he wouldn't get shot. This shows that John Smith cares about Pocahontas and her family.

The DVD release is one you should get. The music of this moive is just amazing. So is the animation. It's so good. This is a classic you should see. Colors of the wind is one of the best disneys songs.

I suppose the Disney folk felt it was quite safe to malign several (dead) historical figures in their dubious account of Pocahontas' arrival in London (something she did in 1616, with her husband and son).  As for poor John Ratcliffe, the villain of this sequel, as well as the original `toon, he died in 1609, murdered in the new world (he was anything but a villain, wanting to maintain peace and trade with Chief Powhatan's tribe).  But hey, why let a little thing like reality and the truth get in your way while you're trying desperately to make a buck off of someone's life and reputation.  They're all dead and can't defend themselves from unscrupulous animators.

Sadly, the animation is done on the cheap (and it looks it).  There are a couple of songs tossed in.  The comic relief is back.  The story isn't worth mentioning because it's fraudulent from start to finish.  Even Mel Gibson couldn't be bothered to add his voice to the effort; his brother Donal did the dubious honor instead.

I'm giving it three stars for Meeko, Flit, and Percy.",1420675200,,1101,4.692708333333333
7724259,3,B01DTNVGYI,"Getting past the historical inaccuracies in this cartoon is difficult.  It immediately begs the question why bother to make a movie about a historical figure if you have no intention of going anywhere near the truth.  Matoaka, known as Amonute, and later as Rebecca Rolfe, was nicknamed Pocahontas.  She was about 10 or 11 years old when she met John Smith, so if we're to accept a love story from the pair, that would make Smith a pedophile.  She died in her early twenties.  John Smith was notorious for changing his account of their meeting and subsequent rescue from the hand of her father.  That the Disney studio would seek to glorify lies is peculiar but not unexpected.  Perhaps their main interest had more to do with their predilection for having a main character with a dead parent (her mother was dead and gone at the start of the story).  The Disney Studio does seem to have an unhealthy obsession with dead parents.

Naturally, the artwork is stunning, if only the story had been handled with as much regard.  As for the music, when they're not celebrating greed in song, they're singing about `savages.'  It's not very uplifting; no matter what color the wind.

As a cartoon aimed at children, Pocahontas is not particularly flattering as far as anyone is concerned......except for the comic relief (Meeko, Flit, and Percy).",1420675200,,1339,4.799126637554585

The original Pocahontas was pretty impressive, in story, soundtrack and animation.
I am well aware of the fact that the real Pocahontas and John Smith were never engaged, but who cares? Disney took liberties from original sources before and made works of art.

As for this sequel, well...it just seems to take everything that was in the original movie and toss it out the window.
There were some things I liked about this film, though:

. I honestly liked some of the action in this film better than the first; the fight sequence in the climax was pretty entertaining to watch

. The soundtrack, while not as ""mythical"" and majestic as the original film, was pretty decent and nice to listen to..and in some ways, even better than the original film

. The animation is obviously downgraded compared to the original film, but it's not that terrible.

What really angered me is that it destroyed the pure and beautiful romance between Pocahontas and John Smith from the first film; all in favor for ""historical accuracy"".  Oh, please; if this was the case, then why create the romance in the first film to begin with? Also, the characters are just...well...out of the character compared to the original film.

7724325,1,B01DTNVGYI,"Honestly, this is the worst Disney movie I ever saw (except maybe Pocahantas II)! From its complete historical inaccuracy to its frankly misleading picture of colonial/Indian stereotypes, this movie  tops the list of Disney's attempt at brainwashing.
1. The Indians are portrayed as a perfect society living in peace and harmony with nature until the bad, greedy colonists showed up. Intertribal wars, human sacrifices, and polytheism are all swept under the rug. Then, enter the Spanish colonists--the fat, greedy, naive, gold-loving fellers of trees who attempt to force their beliefs on everyone else. Seriously?!
2. Another hidden attempt to champion pantheism--Grandmother Willow is basically a goddess in her own environment, and obviously every tree, river, animal, and blade of grass has an ""inner spirit"" that is just being trampled on by the English. Obviously grizzly bears are harmless....if you look at them the right way, that is.
3. John Smith is a blonde, blue-eyed young sailor instead of the old grey military general he's supposed to be. AND he falls in love with Pocahantas--who, according to history, was only a girl. The historical reality is much harsher, with faults and violence on both sides, and while Disney can take license with fairy tales, I would beg them not to completely distort and replace history with myth.
4. Despite all of Disney's hidden messages of ""going green"" and ""living in nature is better than living in a city, obviously"", the songs are simply loaded with stereotypes. Don't get me wrong, the singing is beautiful--but the lyrics drag heavy at times, weighed down by the sheer disconnect from reality.
5. Most importantly, Disney is saying that everyone's way of living is equally good, that truth is relative, and that the best thing you can possibly do is ""listen to your heart."" But of course, in order to make the audience believe it, they need to present the Natives in the best light possible and the colonists in the worst. What about the greedy captain who was ""listening to his heart,"" huh?
So, in the end, the moral for our white, tree-wrecking, narrow-minded culture is that we would have been better off leaving North America in 1607 as we found it. No doubt the colonists made many, many, many grievous mistakes and committed many atrocities. But Disney disgraces both the English and the Natives by stereotyping them. Equality does not mean demonizing one side or glorifying the other, it consists of presenting both with the flaws and virtues they had. Presenting the story of Sacagawea (along with Lewis and Clark) might have been a much better option and one that might have actually conveyed bravery, courage, and determination to our children without requiring a complete butchering of actual history.

Not pleasing to the eye at all.

Back to the music; it's probably very expensive to create an original score, with inspired lyrics to match. But most writers can come up with a rhyme. It's like they wrote some poorly constructed poetry and then shoved notes into its mouth.

7724331,2,B01DTNVGYI,"I am usually a Disney fan, though my childhood is long past; but this film was a huge disappointment. In my opinion Disney films are at their best when they appeal to both children and adults, but ""Pocahontas"" is more a children's story, despite its serious topic.

Pocahontas and John Smith - a true story, which is unfortunately not truthfully told here but audaciously idealized. (As far as I know, today's Indians protested quite a lot about this interpretation of the first clash of the American natives with the Europeans).
In the film, after a few difficulties both races make up and learn to get along; the two lovers have saved the situation paying by renouncing on a life together. The fact that the Indian tribes were for the most part slain and wiped out during the following centuries is of course elegantly hushed up.
It is also very nave and not believable that Pocahontas and John Smith immediately learned to communicate with one another despite their different languages, only due to ""the power of love"".
That Pocahontas in the end gives up the man she loves to stay with her people with the flimsy excuse ""They need me here"" never convinced me. (Also, in the sequel Journey to a new World"" she does travel to England after all.)
The ending of the film sees John Smith being brought back home by ship because he has a deep bullet wound and the Indian shaman does not know how to help him. How is a badly wounded man supposed to survive the journey across the ocean, which at the time took at least a month?

Apart from this I also couldn't overlook the manual shortcomings: this film's drawings are wooden, there is no comparison to the grace of ""Beauty and the Beast"", the tempo and colourful style of ""Aladdin"" or the superior technique of ""The Lion King"". The music is insignificant except for the epic song ""Colors of the Wind"", which unfortunately remains second rate because the film's actual leitmotif is If ""I Never Knew You"" (this song was not even included in the first edition of the film - it was heard only in the end credits - and added in one of the later editions).
Also, my impression was that the film did not really have an arc of suspense, the conflicts ending where they seemed to climax at last with Pocahontas interceding for John Smith before her father.

The only remarkable detail ""Pocahontas"" offers is the fact that it lacks one of the main attributes of Disney films - the happy ending.
To round up this film, I would recommend watching ""Journey to a new World""; I usually dislike sequels but in this case I felt like it brought a satisfying and credible ending to a story that didn't say much in the first place, at least not to me.",1391040000,,2680,4.556016597510373

My kids would watch this movie every day, as many times a day, as they would be allowed to.  Not completely sure what the draw is, but the movie does have a lot of entertaining scenarios, as well as the fact that Pocahontas may be their favorite Disney ""Princess"".

For the skeptics, or those saying ""how can one song make a difference?"", I have to say that in this movie's case, the one cut song makes all the difference.

When I first watched the cut/edited version of Pocahontas as a kid, it wasn't my favourite Disney film, because I felt that something was missing.  But, when I watched it again with the missing scenes and song, it elevated Pocahontas to being one of my most favourite Disney films.  The powerful songs and etheral animation seems to come together more cohesively in this version.  I choose to completely ignore the sequel even thought it's more historically accurate, because once you watch the 10th Anniversary Edition of the movie and see the love between Pocahontas and John Smith as they sing their love song, you will not be able to imagine Pocahontas ending up with anyone else but John Smith, let alone John Rolfe.",1384732800,11,1121,4.752577319587629

But that is of no fault to this movie. Well ok maybe every little white lie helps water the truth down just a little bit. But those who made the movie were not guilty of anything. I mean it has Mel Gibson is in it. I don't remember him disparaging Native Americans during his racist rant about committing criminal domestic acts upon the mother of his child.

  The process of downloading was very easy. For those with sensitive personalities beware b/c there is a bit of violence. Take an honest look at your child.

7724370,3,B01DTNVGYI,"I remembered watching this movie when I was a little girl and to be honest I loved every second of it. But now that I'm older, I started retrospecting how much I used to enjoy it. As of this day I kind of like it, not as much as when I was 5 years old. I know there are some people who might think if there is any historical accuracy in this Disney movie, to a very small degree there is. But the majority of it is for pure entertainment. Did you know, and this is true but if you don't believe me ask any historian or history teacher/professor, that in real life pocahontas was just a young little girl when she first met John Smith?",1374796800,2,634,4.0396825396825395
7724371,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Pocahontas was one of my childhood favorites! I always loved the songs and the characters! I believe that this is one of disney s better movies(and more ethical than any other before 1995.) This movie gives kids a look into history, and also teaches them about believing in them selves. It however displays mild discrimination by Governor Radcliffe. He and his crew (besides John Smith) call the Indians savages and copper skins. In pocahontas there is few deaths but all are extremely capeable of watching (if you are squeamish.) Other characters include: a inspiring willow tree, A love able but snotty pug, and Pocahontas' playful, adorable, and hilarious raccoon Meeko!

7724373,3,B01DTNVGYI,"First of all, the kids loved this; however, the writers took a lot of liberty with the story - changing Pocahontas' age, John Smith's background, etc.  I would prefer that the story represented more of the actual story.

However based on what I have read they did capture the essence of the real Pocahontas's effervescent, innocent and charismatic personality. I loved this movie as a child and love it more as an adult especially once I began researching my family history and discovered that my great-aunt's husband of 50 years was a direct descendant of Pocahontas and her husband John Rolfe, who is mentioned in the sequel.

7724411,2,B01DTNVGYI,"There is a spoiler in this review.

Setting aside the historical inaccuracies (if we wanted accurate historical information, Disney+Mel Gibson is probably one of the least reliable sources)  how does a movie where someone is murdered with a shotgun have a G rating??

Aside from that, it's not that interesting.  Visually its appealing, and the animation is beautiful, but the content is sparse, and the perspective is extremely dichotomous.  Yes, we get that the explorers (prospectors) were greedy gold-grubbers who only wanted to murder savages.  Yes, yes, we get it.  It's a movie about fighting, making violence, and declaring war, interspersed with some heavy-handed greed and some pretty songs about nature and a love story.  That makes people suddenly able to speak other languages.

The movie wasn't one I would buy (we rented) but I won't get it again once I realized that with a G rating, you can still kill someone with a shotgun.  Of course, if anyone showed any skin, it would be rated R, but killing people is OK for kids.  (???)  I guess that's not really an issue with this movie.  With this movie, I have the same problem I usually have with Disney: why all the violence in the kids movies?",1359936000,,1208,4.805825242718447

7724414,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Okay, so I got the instant video version of this movie.  That is good for the main reason of not having to replace it, because the movie will always be in your video library (unless something should happen like Amazon going out of business or something, but I don't anticipate that to happen anytime soon).  You don't have to worry about the disc getting scratched, or worried about it getting lost or whatever.  The bad thing about streaming movies is that you only get the movie with no options.  I can't get subtitles, and there's none of the extra stuff that you get when you buy the disc.  All you get with streaming is the movie itself, which I suppose is fine, but not if you're interested in the extra bonus materials.  I gave it four stars for the movie itself, but took off a point because Amazon should be able to put the full content options that the DVD/BluRay has.  It is 2013 you know!  I'm sure they could.",1358985600,,922,4.382352941176471

7724436,3,B01DTNVGYI,"...it was a pretty uneventful movie. It wasn't terrible, but it felt more rushed and dull than the first one. (As always, the original is way better.)

The first movie was emotionally charged and told a story (not that this one doesn't, it just doesn't do it successfully) and keeps you engaged and entertained the whole time. The first movie was chock full of rich detail, lessons, and strong emotion, with some minor comic relief strewn throughout. But overall, it was rich with feeling, and possibly the only Disney movie where none of the musical numbers seemed cheesy or pointless. This one was full of lame comical antics between Percy, Flit, and Meeko, and lacked substance. The one exciting scene was very near the end where Smith, Rolfe and Pocahontas face off against Ratcliffe, and then it's over...The rest of the movie was just one big blah. The first movie was great from start to finish and I don't think it needed this sequel.

One of the things I did like though, was some of the tie-ins and consistencies from the first movie that carried over into this one.

This part isn't a big deal for most people, but the costumer and historical fashion junkie in me is SCREAMING about the ""Wait Till He Sees You"" segment (where Rolfe's maid is dressing Pocahontas for the ball) 19th century undergarments in a 17th century movie?! WHY?! The hoopskirt, underbust corset and pantaloons looked like something straight out of Gone With the Wind, NOT something belonging in the English court of the 1600s/1610s. Not to mention the swooping neckline and bare shoulders of the gown (again, something not in fashion until much later.) And the Marie-Antoinette like hair...

Overall, a decent movie. Not great, kinda good, but definitely lacking in many areas compared to the original. 2.5/5",1355011200,,1791,4.862295081967213

7724453,4,B01DTNVGYI,"This 1998 straight-to-video sequel to Disney's 1995 feature ""Pocahontas"", plays fast and loose with historical fact (much like the original film) but has good intentions at it's core.  The quality of the animation is quite lush and the participation of many of the original voice artists helps viewers transition effortlessly into this second ""Pocahontas"" adventure.

It's been several months since John Smith left Jamestown and much has changed.  The goodwill generated between the English and the villagers following John Smith's departure has all but vanished.  Back in England, Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) has staged an assassination attempt on John Smith, and fed the King all manner of lies relating to Jamestown's so-called ""savages"".  In an effort to quell the tension, John Rolfe (Billy Zane) has been dispatched to Jamestown to escort ""Chief Pocahontas"" back to England for an audience with the King.  When Pocahontas (Irene Bedard with singing voice once again provided by Judy Kuhn) arrives in England, it sets the stage for a dramatic reunion with John Smith but also a terrifying encounter with Ratcliffe...

Whilst the story is fairly simplistic, POCAHONTAS II: JOURNEY TO A NEW WORLD does carry enough of the potent magic of the original film to carry it through.  There are some cute scenes with Pocahontas being schooled, ""Pygmalion""-style, by John Rolfe and his dotty housekeeper Mrs Jenkins (Jean Stapleton) and some rather lovely songs (in particular Pocahontas' first number ""Where Do I Go From Here?"" and the haunting end credits duet ""Between Two Worlds"").  Who would have pegged Billy Zane as a singer?  Unfortunately Mel Gibson was unable to reprise his role of John Smith but his younger brother Donal Gibson provides a very accurate facsimile.

I believe Pocahontas fell in love with John Rolfe, because he understood her. He learn more about her when she got into Londa. She loved him, because not only did he understand her but also because he learned to respect her. She was not afraid to stick up for what she believed in which in turn made him respect her. The previous main character John is a really life guy in the real world. People change. I believe when everyone thought he was dead as well as Pocahontas, she realized that she was missing something. It happened not to be the previous John. She learned she was missing being her. She was sick of hearing everyone tell her what to do. In this movie, she learns what she wants and goes for her.

7724472,3,B01DTNVGYI,"This film was apparently done for television and the format is definitely that of television  in the late 1990s. This implies the picture cannot be as rich as on a silver screen, and special effects have to be more modest. It also implies a lot of close-up images and slower movement.

The film though is interesting in all the twists it introduces in the story.

The meeting with John Rolfe in America is purely formal and it is the fact that Powhatan, her father, decides to send her on a diplomatic mission in England that she is going to travel with John Rolfe and actually have a rather close and yet distant connection.

In fact John Rolfe is going to fall in love with her little by little and then she will fall in love with him at the same pace. The adventures in London have nothing to do with reality. She is at first a success at the Hunt Ball, but she is frightened and horrified by the treatment of a bear in some magic show presented to the King by Ratcliffe who is waiting for Pocahontas' mission to fail in order to take the lead of an armada that is already ready to sail to Virginia in order to exterminate the savages. Ratcliffe wants his vengeance.

She is then sent to the Tower to be executed on the following day. But then John Smith gets John Rolfe on a salvaging mission to the Tower. Pocahontas discovers John Smith and her old friendship is reactivated but for no avail because what John Smith proposes is not stability but adventure and Pocahontas wants some kind of stability.

They escape from the Tower of London and rush to the admiralship of the armada to stop Ratcliffe. The battle is funny, but without any suspense at all. It is then that she discovers she loves John Rolfe and that her love is answered positively. So they sail to America to live their love story in Virginia.

Nothing to do with real story, with her marrying John Rolfe in Jamestown and having a son Thomas there. Nothing to do with her dying in Gravesend and being buried there. This is pure fiction and as such does not help re-evaluating the character. It is pure commercial exploitation of a fertile field and nothing else.

7724473,5,B01DTNVGYI,"WALT DISNEY - POCAHONTAS - 1995

The film is a perfect animated production and the main two assets are the music and the songs and of course the very dynamic animation. This is particularly true with the Indians who are shown in a realistic way cultivating big fields of Indian corn and tobacco, and fishing. They are not shown hunting though. But they are shown dancing, singing, and at the end of a waR against another tribe, though the prisoners are not shown and there was no war between two Indian tribes without some prisoners, the men for ritual sacrificing, and women and children to become slaves. The best off were the children because they were adopted. That is not shown directly. It will only come later WITH John Smith.

The Europeans are shown as what they are, male adventurers with very mixed intentions and a very conflict-ridden social situation. The noble Governor Ratcliffe is a real pest and pain in the back from beginning to end. He is a perfect commander, giving orders but doing nothing, and having only one objective: to find gold by digging, as if digging anywhere in America was supposed to bring gold out of the earth. It is true noble people do not need to have an education since they are born intelligent and they have no concrete practice of what real work is. This is shown in the most obvious and impressive way.

John Smith is made the captain of the ship. He is humane and he is able to save a man overboard in the middle of a tempest. He is a discoverer and goes out to meet the Indians, and he meets Pocahontas, the daughter of the chief Powhatan who is seen as a warrior and not an old man. The Europeans are shown a little bit more realistically than usual and they use row-boats to go up and down the river, not Indian canoes, like in most other versions.

Pocahontas is shown as a young woman and not a girl, who is adventurous in her own way though at first distant and even fearful. But she accepts contact rather easily and she introduces John Smith to her grand mother Willow, a willow that speaks and gives advice.

This meeting of John Smith and Pocahontas is amplified by the meeting of Pocahontas' raccoon and Ratcliffe's pampered dog. This is both charming and funny, how the savage raccoon is so much apter to survive any kind of trouble coming from a civilized dog than the reverse. The third animal here is a humming bird who is the jester of the triad.

At this moment Thomas, a young sailor who had followed John on Ratcliffe's order, tries to protect John Smith against Kocoum who had followed Pocahontas, shoots Kocoum dead. Then John Smith, who protects the young chap, is submitted to an ordeal, a path of torture between two lines of Indians hitting him with any bludgeon they may have. He is saved by Pocahontas in extremis. Here the Indian custom is not specified, because of course it is not the case here: a woman who has lost family in a battle can claim a prisoner to replace the dead relative. This is the weak point of the film because Pocahontas' claim is not justified from the Indian point of view. That makes Powhatan weak.

But the most important part of the film is the showing of the opposition of two cultures, two visions of the world.

Powhatan declares: ""These white men are dangerous. No one is to go near them."" That's pure fear in front of the thunder sticks, the rifles.

But then John Smith explains to Pocahontas what follows. ""We'll show you people how to use this land properly, how to make the most of it."" And he retorts to Pocahontas' objection as follows. ""You say that because you don't know better."" And he calls the Indians ""savages"" which causes the retreat of Pocahontas. Then he explains his mind. ""Savage is just a word, a term for people who are uncivilized."" That's burning his boat and then sinking the ashes. Pocahontas conclusion is just to the point. Savages are people who are ""not like you.""

And that's when a war starts.

The two cultures, Indians and English men, are just the same and they sing the same song about savages, the savages being of course demons on the other side. Powhatan leads the Indian movement as the chief of them when the warriors from other tribes have arrived. Ratcliffe leads the English but for his own narrow-minded, violent, even cruel, and greedy motivations.

Grand Mother Willow advises Pocahontas properly, the raccoon brings Jim Smith's compass it had stolen a long time before and that's the dream: a spinning arrow showing the way. Pocahontas takes John Smith with her and they go to Powhatan to stop the war just when the two armies are face to face. Powhatan accepts his daughter's demand. ""My daughter speaks with the wisdom beyond her years. We've all come here with anger in our hearts, but she's come with courage and understanding. From this day if there's to be more killing, it will not start with me.""

The fool then is Ratcliffe who tries to shoot Powhatan, but John Smith gets in-between and It is John Smith who is shot. He has to go back to England, to be cured and healed, or to die on the ship taking him to England. That ending is a lot better than going back to England to cure and heal severe burns caused by his dumb smoking next to a bag of gun powder.

So what's the meaning of the film? Definitely a call for wisdom in the relations between ethnic groups, a total evacuation of the invasion of Indian territory by Europeans, a discrete allusion to the genocide that was to come later on, a total absence of real commerce between the English and the Indians, the fact that the Europeans do not seem keen on starting survival activities like cultivating the land or hunting properly.

The film is in fact entirely transferred from the historical point of view to the sentimental point of view, as a metaphor of the ethnic situation.

When John Smith falls in love with Pocahontas and is a prisoner destined to be brained alive or rather brained dead on the following morning he tells Pocahontas: ""No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever."" And when John Smith is being taken to his ship, Pocahontas says: ""No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever."" Perfect echo, perfect metaphor.

The animals show the same meaning with Ratcliffe's dog dressed in an Indian cape at the very same moment when Powhatan put his own cape on the wounded John Smith on his stretcher.

Moralistic probably but for sure in the trend of the end of the 20th century when, after the Wounded Knee Incident (February 27, 1973), when a full reassessing of the presence and role of Indians and Indian blood in America was started and found its ultimate realization in the presence of Indians and Indian floats on the inaugural parade for President Barack Obama in January 2009.

Walt Disney did not create the re-evaluation of Pocahontas, but they sure amplified it.

7724489,2,B01DTNVGYI,"There are highs and lows to almost all Disney fare, especially more recent ones.  The early days of Disney animation as easier to forgive because of the general majesty that came from the grand depictions of these fairy tales.  More recent entries in the Disney archives to feel more stilted and generic than they used to.  They aren't as sinister as some of the early films (`Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is still rather chilling today) and yet they almost lack any real bite to the point where they can become somewhat predictably boring.  `Tangled' was a refreshing rebirth so-to-speak; but can they really follow that up?

I'm still wondering.

So that leaves us with `Pocahontas', the 1995 retelling of the European settlers' first meeting with the Indians.  First of all, historically this is rather ignorant and it should not be used to help young ones understand the truth about our founding fathers.  This is given the glossy treatment most Disney movies are given and treated more like a Shakespeare play than anything else.  John Smith is Romeo, obviously, and Pocahontas is Juliet.  Sadly, Disney doesn't understand how to change things up.  Pocahontas doesn't feel like her own character.  She isn't any different than Ariel or Mulan or whoever else you want to name out of the Disney Princess archive.  She is a free spirit who has a formulistic father and a dead mother.  She follows her heart to a man or a path or a whatever that is against all logic and proves to be wiser than everyone else and thus there is that `ah-ha' moment and everyone realizes they should have listened to her all along.

Bah.

The singing, outside of that `Colors in the Wind' song is rather atrocious.  The actors here just can't sing.  The color palate for the film is a tad drab and doesn't have the usual grandeur that we have grown accustom to with Disney films.  Sure, those two little creatures (I'm referring to the dog and the raccoon) are cute, but they aren't the stars of the this movie; and quite frankly, Pocahontas and John Smith make a boring couple.",1335830400,2,2064,4.6991643454039
7724490,1,B01DTNVGYI,"So, I mean I understand that Disney wanted to continue the story of Pocahontas, but honestly, this movie was not worth watching at all. All of the returning characters seemed super OC and I didn't like that. And also, Mrs. Jenkins was a weird character and I found her pushing Rolfe and Pocahontas disgusting and unnecessary. Now for my rant about Rolfe. He had absolutely no character development, but simply went from a jerk to a nice man in a blink of the eye. That doesn't happen in real life. Yes I know, relating a Disney movie to real life is stupid, but honestly they should have had enough sense to at least show him change a little. Now, when John Smith came back I had a little hope, because I was figured ""Well, he and Pocahontas can just pick up where they left off"" Because their parting in the first movie was so emotional. But then to A) have him act obnoxious and then B) have Pocahontas just not love him anymore, completely ruined the whole story line of the first movie. Hadn't they said something about always being there for each other in the first movie? Well obviously it didn't carry into the second. And to have him let her go with John Rolfe so easily? Really? What man in love do you know that would let them woman he loves go off with another guy just like that? Seriously.

This movie is a good watch for a lazy evening or to keep the kids entertained.",1333756800,,455,4.364705882352941

7724497,2,B01DTNVGYI,"I hope those who buy this for their children also explain the truth about who Pocahontas really was:
- That her real name was Matoaka (the name Pocahontas was only a nickname meaning ""spoiled child"")
- That she was not a woman but a little girl no older than 11 years old
- That John Smith decimated her people and she accused him of being a liar (Smith conveniently claimed, after her death and 17 years after the fact, that she ""rescued"" him no less than 3 times)
- That she was forced to marry John Rolfe, a tobacco farmer, as a condition of her release after being kidnapped and taken to England and then renamed ""Rebecca"" (We can thank John for today's cigarette epidemic)
- That she died in England at 21 or 22 years old and never saw her own people again

And furthermore:
- That Disney refused the help of the modern day Powhatans, of which Pocahontas was a member, for cultural and historical accuracy
- That Disney created and perpetuated this myth in the name of ""entertainment"" at the expense of others (the Powhatans)

Not quite the ""magic"" Disney portrays, is it?!  Watch the movie for the mythical entertainment that it is, but it's important, for children especially, to also know the truth.",1329264000,7,1207,4.552995391705069

John Smith's return was actually quite surprising but i'm glad they
dealt with the same villain from the first film. And John Rolfe was
somethin' else lol triflin! But i loved the movie and happy to add
it to my collection of Disney animated films!",1323302400,,316,4.660714285714286
7724504,3,B01DTNVGYI,"Wow and wow. Disney certainly doesn't restrain itself on this one. This movie plays out more like a Disney parody than an actual film. John Smith is a tall Prince Charming type with flowing blond hair, a commanding voice and the bravery of ten men but nothing beats the introduction of Pocahontas. The camera pans up to her standing in a dramatic pose on a rocky outcrop overlooking the land while the wind whips colorful leaves around her. Since she's Native American she can literally talk to the animals including her raccoon friend, Meeko. A girl in a canoe calls to her and I'm thinking, ""she's definitely going to dive the football field length down into the lake"". To my surprise she turns to run down the mountain... before doubling back and doing a flawless dive into the lake. OF COURSE John Smith and Pocahontas will end up together; they are both perfect. It's not enough for Pocahontas to commune with the animals, she literally talks to the trees and they talk back... with faces. Oh, is that not enough for you? She also gets messages from the wind. Still not convinced Pocahontas is perfection? She is able to learn English instantly, no explanation given. She even understands terms she couldn't possibly have any frame of reference for understanding. Rocks and bushes glow at her touch, raccoons braid her hair and she's able to ride on the wind.

Pocahontas is hundreds of years of white guilt drawn up into one flawless Native American princess. It's is an 81 minute exaltation to the Disney Pocahontas; the Reductio Ad Absurdum of ""Disney Magic"". The actual Pocahontas died in her early 20's married to a tobacco planter named John Rolfe. There is a wisp of a story, a villain and some obnoxious animal sidekicks but they exist merely to complete the Disney formula and pad out the story. This is a story about how freaking AWESOME Native American's are and how only John Smith was worthy of being in their presence. Smith even manages to see the talking tree. There is a song near the end of the movie where the Native American's are shown to be as bigoted as the whites but I doubt the audience is fooled. The Native American's clearly have the moral superiority in this film.

So I hated the movie, correct? Actually no. Pocahontas is such a parody in and of itself that you can just bask in its unapologetic unrestrained self indulgence. Like Superman or Mickey Mouse, Pocahontas the character has no depth and no personal conflict but there can be a certain joy and simplicity in such unimpeachable goodness. She isn't a human she's an archetype of female strength and kindness. When her friend Nakoma confesses that she sent Kocoum to save her leading to his death Pocahontas never ever for a fraction of a second blames Nakoma. She is simply beyond human flaws. If you want to be awash in everything that people love and hate about Disney this is the movie to see.

Financially Pocahontas was a huge success and it has two really good songs but critically it was pretty middle of the road. I really didn't have a problem with any of the voice acting and somehow through the whole film I never picked up on the fact that Smith was voiced by Mel Gibson. Smith's friend Thomas was voiced by a young Christian Bale. To Disney's credit they showed a shocking burst of historical accuracy by having Pocahontas NOT end up with John Smith and in the sequel she correctly ends up with John Rolfe. Pocahontas is sort of a turning point where Disney reached its extreme before pulling back. After this movie Disney started slowly but surely changing the formula culminating in some wonderful films like The Emperor's New Groove and Lilo & Stich. These films were more highly acclaimed but less successful financially. So what is the lesson here? No idea other than Disney sadly learned from the latter two films to avoid experimentation.",1322956800,5,3854,4.706666666666667
7724505,2,B01DTNVGYI,Received the Movie today and the DVD case was broken and DVD was not stable in the package.  Case will not even close.  First time this as happened since I've been ordering from Amazon.,1322438400,,185,4.411764705882353
7724506,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Pocahontas is one hour and twenty-one minutes long and released in theaters on June 23, 1995. The film takes place in the year 1607 on a voyage from London to James Town. The crewmen are basically looking for adventure, Governor John Radcliffe (the leader of the expedition and unknown to the crew) is seeking to find gold mainly because Spain has found gold in Mexico and South America and this is his last chance to redeem himself. Captain John Smith is also part of the crew mainly for the adventure. Once the ship lands in the New World, Governor John Radcliffe hands out the shovels and picks and orders his men to start digging. Meanwhile John Smith is scouting the land for any Indians that might be unfriendly to the settlers. While scouting the land, he meets Pocahontas and the two quickly bond. John Smith explains to Pocahontas that the expedition here is to look for gold and Pocahontas tells John Smith that her village has no gold. John Smith returns to camp and explains to the crew and Governor John Radcliffe that the Tsenacommacah people have no gold. Governor John Radcliffe believes this is a lie and plans to attack the tribe at first sunlight. John Smith sneaks back out at night to warn Pocahontas and her people. Kocoum comes looking for Pocahontas and finds John Smith there with her. Kocoum attacks John Smith and is killed by Thomas who is trying to save John. John Smith is brought back by the village to be killed the next day. Before Chief Powhatan can kill him Pocahontas intervenes and saves John. The crew sees this and puts down their weapons; however Governor Radcliffe thinks this is a trick and aims his musket at Chief Powhatan to kill him. Captain John Smith saves Chief Powhatan and is serious wounded. In the Captain John Smith is taken back to London for treatment of his wound and Governor John Radcliffe is sent back to London in chains.

The main thing I did not like about the movie and did not mention above is the character of Grandmother Willow which is a giant willow tree with a women's face. Those scenes just made the movie weird. Pocahontas is the first Disney movie to be bases on a real life person even if the movie did interpret the events correctly. Pocahontas is an enjoyable movie to watch and gets an A+.

7724507,4,B01DTNVGYI,"I am not a Disney fan, but when my daughter was younger she wanted to see various Disney films and while I disliked a lot of them, this is one I really enjoyed.

Of course, it isn't factual, the relations between Pocohontas and John Smith weren't as they are portrayed here, but it makes for a lovely story for kids and John Smith is a lovely hero, gung ho, funny and tender. Pocohontas is brave and independent, and for once the Disney empire's princess obsession is suited, as she was indeed a princess - or anyway, the daughter of the chief - in reality.

Serious issues about imperialism and environmental abuse are actually touched on, and the songs are generally good. Of course, there is the obligatory one dimensional villain (and his villainous pet) but this isn't used to simplify the social issues, for once.

I loved the sparkly magic effects when John Smith and Pochontas fall in love.

Always snivelled at the ending, oh dear.

I am taking U.S. history and John Roulf and Pocahontaus end up together and real life that's why they end up together in the movie. Also John Smith and Pocahontus never really had a real romance.

They either complain that the movie is too mature (it tries too hard to be politically correct, and it is too blatant in its portrayal of violence and racism), or that it is too childish (making a mockery of actual history by portraying it in a cartoon-ish and simplistic manner). So, what is it?

The problem is that people already have too many opinions formed about it before they even watch it. People were already protesting 'Pocahontas' before it was even released way back in 1995! Why judge something before you have seen it?

The only sequel worth watching is The Lion King 2. Anyway, this movie is so completely awful it makes me want to throw up.  First, the animation is obviously not up to the standards of the real classics.  Secondly, the story and plot line are so bad that I am now trying to forget that someone ever thought up such a horrible sequel to such a beautiful movie.  I would like to meet them and ask them what they were smoking.  Everything about Pocahontas 2 was terrible and an embarrasment to the Disney company.  I think they should recall this movie and destroy every copy, so as to rid the earth of this terrible tragedy and restore respect people had for Disney movies before this mess was created.

I think a lot of people didn't like this one because there was such a disconnect from the original. Not for me, though. The first one had its merits, that's for sure, but I found this to be much more interesting. It felt more realistic than most Disney films because it addressed a fundamental aspect of life: people move on and change. We're not constant beings, as romantic a notion that may be. We fall in and out of love. In that respect, I was impressed that it had that much balls. Cause, you know, it's Disney. Love is forever and all that jazz. That's not a bad thing, either. It's definitely a positive outlook, but not too grounded in reality.

The real story is that she was a hostage of the white settlers, assigned to Capt. Smith when she was a teenager captured from her father's house. Since this was a well-known Indian custom (and ancient practice among humans), there was little surprise or action proceeding from this kidnapping, and she was a hostage to peace between the Powhatans and the Europeans. It is unknown what Smith's and Pocahontas's feelings were about each other. Smith took her, still a teenager, to England dressed in English clothing of the time (and most of the true portrayals of Pocahontas are in English clothing). Smith did marry her, and Pocahontas bore him a child. She died of (I think) tuberculosis before she and her family could sail back to the US, at the age of 19, having been displayed at the English court as a reformed savage.",1253664000,,997,4.702857142857143

7724570,3,B01DTNVGYI,"Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World is one hour and thirteen minutes and was released on video on August 14, 1998 and on DVD on September 5, 2000. The movie picks up were the original left off. John Smith has is in London looking over some sea charts when guards kick open the door and try to arrest him for treason, but John Smith makes his escape and it is assumed that he has died. Back at Jamestown it is winter there and Pocahontas is still in morning over the presumed death of John Smith. Later that day a ship arrives from London and John Rolfe emerges from the ship on a horse. The horse is meant for Chief Powhatan but when John hears the villagers talking about Pocahontas, he assumes that they are talking about Chief Pocahontas. John and Pocahontas meet early on but do not realize who one another are. Later that evening John shows up riding the horse and asks for the Mighty Pocahontas and when she steps forward he is surprise. John is there to ask for Chief Powhatan to come with him back to England to have an audience with King James. Pocahontas goes as the voice of her people. The next day Pocahontas and her bodyguard, Uttamatomakkin, set sail for England along with John Rolfe. Along for the ride are her three stowaway companions: Meeko, Flit and Percy. When the gang arrives in London they head to the home of John Rolfe and along the way meet Governor Ratcliffe. This is the first time the two meet face to face in this movie. Governor Ratcliffe show John the order from King James that if she does not convince the him that the Indians are friendly people then an armada is to set sail declaring war on the Indians. Once they arrive at the home of John Rolfe they are greeted by Mrs. Jenkins (she is to believed to be the house keeper). The on going joke with Mrs. Jenkins is her glasses; if she does not have them on she can not make out who is who. Like at the end of the movie she has mistaken the horse's tail for Pocahontas hair. John leaves Pocahontas in Mrs. Jenkins care while he is off to see King James. At the court of King James, Governor Ratcliffe is there to see that things do not go well for John. He suggests that the King have a Hunt Ball to so Pocahontas can try to impress him. If Pocahontas does not then the armada will be sent. John Rolfe does not like this idea, but Pocahontas is determined to impress the king. John and Mrs. Jenkins teach Pocahontas the customs, dances and manners needed to impress King James. John, Pocahontas, and Uttamatomakkin head for the Hunt Ball. At first the king is impressed but at dinner things do not go well for Pocahontas. Governor Ratcliffe is having a bear-baiting and Pocahontas can not watch a bear being torture and comes to the rescue of the bear. King James calls her a savage for defending the bear and Pocahontas accuses the King of acting like a savage. King James orders Pocahontas and Uttamatomakkin off to prison. Later that evening at a bar some of the people are talking about the arrest of Pocahontas and a stranger overhears them talking and gets on his horse and leaves. The stranger is John Smith and he arrives at the home of John Rolfe. The two plot the escape of Pocahontas and Uttamatomakkin. It is still evening and John Rolfe arrives with a prisoner (John Smith in disguise) to help in the escape of Pocahontas and Uttamatomakkin. The four manage to flee jail and make it to a cabin in the woods where the two men argue over what to do with Pocahontas. She hears the two men argue and flees into the woods. Pocahontas emerges from the woods with her mind made up and eventually decides to meet with King James as Princess Pocahontas and without all the make up she had on the night before. She enters the court of King James and Queen Anne to make her case to the both of them. While Queen Anne believes her story, King James does not until John Smith enters the court. When King James sees that he is alive and well he realizes that Governor Ratcliffe has been lying to him all along. King James tells the trio it is to late however, the armada is getting ready to set sail to Jamestown. John Smith, John Rolfe, Pocahontas, and Uttamatomakkin set off to the ships. All four manage to make it aboard the ship that Governor Ratcliffe is sailing. In the end Governor Ratcliffe is lead off in chains to prison and John Smith and Pocahontas realize they have separate paths to follow and John Rolfe and Pocahontas set sail for Jamestown and Uttamatomakkin stays behind with Mrs. Jenkins. Pocahontas II - Journey to a New World came with five new songs: Where Do I Go From Here?, What A Day In London, Wait 'Til He Sees You, Things Are Not What They Appear, and Between Two Worlds. As for as I am concerned, the sequel does not live up the original and the animation was not top quality. Pocahontas II - Journey to a New World get a C-.

7724572,1,B01DTNVGYI,"I've been a fan of the original Pocahontas movie since I was five. I'm nineteen now, and recently came across this movie on YouTube and watched it. I heard about the movie when it first came out when I was eight, but I never saw it, and my mom refused to buy it for me. Now I know why. This film is so horrendous that I'm incapable of considering it canon. I REFUSE to acknowledge this horrible sequel to be a continuation of Pocahontas' story. I know that Disney was historically inaccurate in the first movie and wanted to ""correct"" things in the sequel, but by doing so, they angered many people and ruined what made the original movie so great.

The first, and most obvious thing, that I cannot forgive Disney for doing, is ruining the beautiful love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. In the original movie, Pocahontas and John Smith had to actually get to know the other person and overcome obstacles in order to be together. Their love for each other was portrayed so beautifully and passionately, and is rare, even in Disney cinema. Disney heavily implied that Pocahontas and John Smith were meant to be together in the original movie, but with this crappy sequel, they threw that away completely. I hated how in the sequel, the strong, beautiful love Pocahontas and John Smith had for each other meant nothing. Basically, when Pocahontas and John Smith said to each other, ""I'll always be with you, forever,"" it was all crap.

Second, Smith was so out of character in this movie, it's ridiculous. In the first movie, his character went from being arrogant and laid back to someone who was passionate, loyal, and who fought for his beliefs. His character developed in the original movie. In the sequel, he's an airhead who only cares for adventure and glory. To say that Pocahontas' influence on him was only temporary is absolutely ludicrous. I was appalled that the creators of this movie chose to regress his character to the point that he was unrecognizable. The John Smith in the original movie wouldn't have let Pocahontas walk away from him so easily. He would've fought for her and proved to her that he truly loved her. When she decides to go off with John Rolfe in this movie, he doesn't care at all! I was disgusted that the creators butchered his character completely and angry that the creators set him up to look like a jerk so that the audience would justify Pocahontas choosing John Rolfe. Plus, in the beginning of the movie, John Smith is shown in his home in England looking over a map of the New World and making plans to go back there. What the heck, Disney!? If you implied that John Smith planned on going back there, most likely to reunite with Pocahontas, why didn't you go through with it? That was crappy writing and extremely lazy.

Third, Pocahontas is completely out of character as well. In the original movie, she was a strong female character. She knew who she was and was confident, but also very down to earth. She, too, was very passionate about the things she believed in and was determined. Pocahontas genuinely loved John Smith. In the sequel, we see an unsure, confused Pocahontas who does what others tell her. No longer does she think for herself in this movie, instead, letting others think for her, and enabling others to try and make her into a person she's not. I was disgusted that Pocahontas let people walk all over her in the sequel - in the original movie, Pocahontas NEVER did that! When her father told her to stand back so that he could kill John Smith, she told him no. When Nacoma tried to persuade her not to see the man she loved, she did so anyway. While watching this movie, I also saw a huge character regression in Pocahontas. I was furious seeing that the creators of this movie would do that. One of the reasons why I loved the original movie was because Pocahontas was a strong female character, but in this movie, she's just weak and a doormat.

My fourth nitpick with this movie is obviously John Rolfe. I hated his character, not just for coming between John Smith and Pocahontas - there was more as to why I didn't like him. He was cowardly and basically walked with his tail in between his legs the entire movie. Additionally, he was pompous and extremely arrogant, but unlike Smith, his character never developed. He only seemed to like Pocahontas once she became a ""civilized"" English woman. He and Pocahontas had no chemistry, no passion, in their relationship. Nothing indicated that they were in love or that they cared for each other deeply. There's no actual romance or love between them. Pocahontas and Rolfe getting together is impulsive and another case of lazy writing.

Next, the creators really screwed up when they let a huge plot hole make way into the sequel. How is Radcliffe not rotting in jail in the sequel when he proved himself to be a fraud and was chained and gagged at the end of the first movie, with full intent of being sent there? Jamestown was his last chance for glory, and he screwed it up big time. Radcliffe knew that he'd lose the King's trust if he screwed up in Jamestown, plus, he physically harmed another human being (John Smith) by shooting him.  How is he roaming as a free man in England after the mess in Jamestown where it was proved that he was a fraud and attempted to attack an entire group of people? When you watch the first movie, Radcliffe's main motive for having the men go to battle wasn't to save John Smith (Even though he motivated everyone to fight that way), it was to see if the Indians had gold.  He had NO part in the second movie, and I had a hard time believing that the King would believe Radcliffe's story over John Smith's, over Thomas' and over all the other settlers there who saw for themselves that Radcliffe was a complete fraud. Why weren't they listened to as well? How Radcliffe gets away with those two things is beyond me. He shouldn't have any place in this movie, and the fact that he's a ""free man"" after his crimes in Jamestown is yet another case of bad writing.

Last, but certainly not least, is both the animation and the music. In the original, the animation was gorgeous! I loved the coloring, and how it appeared that time and effort was made into making the characters look just right. Each of the scenes in the movie was breathtaking for its own reasons. Also, the music in the first movie - fantastic, and the musical score was beautiful too. I understand that this movie is a sequel, and has a lower budget, but I still feel like a little more effort could've been made. The animation is sub-par compared to the first, and most of the characters look completely unrecognizable. The songs are horrid and make your ears cringe. It seems like the only reason why there were songs in the movie was just to make it longer.

If you can't already tell, I hate this movie. It ruins a beautiful love story, regresses the two characters from the original movie that we've come to know and love to the point that they're unrecognizable, and delivers lackluster animation and songs that have yet to be memorable and enjoyed. If you're a fan of the original movie, or just in general, don't consider this movie canon. I don't. To me, the end of the first movie left it completely open, but not for a sequel as crappy as this. Personally, I like to think that John Smith made his way back to the New World and reunited with Pocahontas. They marry, have beautiful kids, and live happily ever after.",1243900800,16,7460,4.557046979865772

I loved the colors, the music, the people, and Meeko. :)
True, this movie bears no resemblance to historical fact. But ignore that and watch the story. There is a powerful message about the dangers of prejudice. The song Savages always chills me to the bone. Here are two cultures so bent on anger they cannot see how alike they are. And we, the audience, see how incredibly alike they are as they prepare for battle. I am constantly reminded of this song, and, I'm sad to say, have fallen victim to preconcieved notions myself. This movie was very fundamental to helping me view people as people. I believe this is a film children should see for it's gentle message of tolerance.",1241222400,3,922,4.494047619047619

7724581,5,B01DTNVGYI,"I always liked this movie, but it seemed over-edited, like there was too much missing.  It turns out there was, and with this 10th Anniversary DVD release, Disney finally fixed those problems with storyline and emotional impact, notably with the inclusion of the duet ""If I Never Knew You.""  I hadn't seen this movie since the VHS release, which didn't look good:  the bright colors bled into each other on tape.  Apparently, the earlier DVD release wasn't that great, either.  But THIS release shows just how gorgeous this film really is: the colors are simply amazing, and the widescreen shows how striking the background art is (the design for the forest scenes reminds me of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" with a lot of vertical/horizontal contrast used.)

Too much was made of the historical liberties taken with this film at the time of its release during the politically correct Nineties.  It's not a documentary, it's a Disney movie:  get over it and enjoy the story.

There is the usual light comedy provided by animal friends and minor characters.  The villain is unlikable, but not really demonic or anything, which fits in with this film being more about people's fears and assumptions, and what the British were hoping to find in America versus what was really there.  It is true that the characterization in this film isn't quite as deep as in some of the better known Disney classics, but that doesn't detract from the overall quality.  I actually find ""Pocahontas"" to be one of the most poignant Disney movies because it is not a fairy tale, and everything is not perfect in the end.

The music of ""Pocahontas"" has never gotten much attention, except for the somewhat preachy ""Colors of the Wind,"" but it's always been one of my favorite Disney soundtracks.  Native American music provides a strong undercurrent.  I especially love ""Just around the Riverbend"" and ""If I Never Knew You,"" which was always present in the film during the credits.

I have to mention the moment when Pocahontas and John Smith first meet face to face in the mist in front of the waterfall.  It's exquisite and unforgettable.

No one can make wonderfully animated musical movies with heart like Disney, and I really hope that they return to making films like this someday, instead of just those Pixar movies.  They're fun, but they're not beautiful like this movie is.",1226188800,3,2349,4.85678391959799
7724582,2,B01DTNVGYI,"I think it goes without saying that you shouldn't expect historical accuracy out of Disney. This is a company built on talking mice and mermaids, so I didn't wasn't looking for a history lesson. That aside, this movie wasn't as horrible as most of the direct-to-video sequels. The songs weren't memorable, but they didn't grate on my nerves. And, while I'm no expert, I felt that the animation wasn't bad either. It wasn't on par with the first movie. But it wouldn't have been out of place on a Saturday morning cartoon.

My 3-year-old seemed to have mixed feelings about this one. She loved that Pocahontas danced in a ballgown, just like the other Disney princesses. But there were long stretches of the movie with no action that seemed to bore her.

Pocahontas herself seemed a little stiff and wooden. There was more chemistry between John Smith and John Rolfe than there was between either ""John"" and Pocahontas. Because of this, my daugher didn't really understand that Pocahontas didn't end up with John Smith.

The original had great animation, great music, and a moving storyline.  The sequal has average animation, mostly bad music and a convoluted storyline that tries too hard to balance fact and fiction regarding the true story of Pocahontas.  BUT, my 3-year-old daughter, who loves the first Pocahontas as well, likes this one just as much.  She likes the fact that Pocahontas goes to England and gets all dressed up in a ball gown, making her look more like the other Disney princesses.  My daughter also doesn't seem to mind the lame jokes and the weird storyline that has Pocahontas winding up with someone other than the ""prince"" from the first movie.

7724594,1,B01DTNVGYI,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was released in '85. I remember being mildly entertained but annoyed, despite my loose grasp of American history, at the extreme liberties taken with the realities of this true story. No, I was not expecting a documentary from Disney, but a second viewing a few days ago really brought home how non-praiseworthy this film really is.

There's a lot to like: love the ""Sleeping Beauty"" era animation style. Pochahontas, as a fictional construct, is gorgeous in a very exotic way, and Mel Gibson delivers a very engaging performance as a fictional John Smith. The overly (as usual) anthropomorphized animals were rendered less obnoxious by not speaking English...but then they threw in a talking tree(!). Oh, and despite the fact that I've grown weary of animated musicals, ""The Colors of the Wind"" is a fabulous (if tree-huggy) number with beautiful visuals.

So what's not to like? Pretty much everything else. The rest of the songs are about on par with the dreck from the Rankin-Bass ""Hobbit"". Remember that? Ugh. I know people defend this movie by justifying the historical inaccuracies as ""art"" or ""minor artistic license"" or whatever, but that demonstrates a deep ignorance that testifies to the shameful state of public education. Another reviewer here used the illustration, by way of comparison, of a supposed film about Anne Frank where she might run off and marry a German soldier. That example carries the right weight, imo. Pochahontas was a little girl when the Jamestown colonists arrived! She was not a statuesque teenager! She may have had some kind of illicit relationship with John Smith later on, but she married somebody else. She was passed around like a novelty back in England and died there. This is not really Disney material, folks.

This goes beyond ""artistic license"" to completely re-writing the story and replacing historical characters with fantastical constructs that just distract the educated viewer from enjoying a nice little tale. When the writers of ""The Patriot"" (another Gibson project) played this loose and fast with history, the historical big wigs eventually pressured them to change the names from actual persons to fictional ones, because the story was no longer really about actual historical people. This one is even worse, and they really should have done the same. This is not a fairy tale, like ""Little Mermaid"" (which was also changed dramatically...but who cares? It's just a fable...), and there is a should be a certain amount of responsibility to see that the lives and efforts of those represented are honored.

If they just wanted to fill their lineup with a ""native American"" story, why not Sacajaweya? Here's a girl who was taken from her people as a child, volunteers or is sold (can't remember) to the Lewis/Clark expedition as a native guide, and ends up finding her own people along the way! Baby Pip grows up and is sponsored by the ""evil white guys"" to get a good education and ends up an important guide and Native advocate in the West. Lots of adventure and some seriously happy endings. Crazy wacky characters built right in, plus it's a ""buddy pic"".

No, we'd rather make up some tree-huggy sexual tension fantasy with bad songs. Gah. It sort of works for pre-schoolers: pretty colors, cute animals, mindless songs...but then why the romantic angle? Kids hate the ""kissy"" stuff. It's like they couldn't make up their mind what they wanted it to be, so the whole thing is kind of half-baked.

It could be worse, I guess.",1196467200,16,3528,4.940978077571669

The thing most people seem to be mad about is that Pocahontas ended up with John Rolfe instead of Smith. And I don't blame any of yall one bit. The sequel totally dashes all of the imagination and magic of the first film because of this. Disney wasn't concerned with historical accuracy in the first film. Why bother with it in the second? Disney should have never made Pocahontas and Smith fall in love in the first place if they were so concerned with adhering to history. If you're gonna lie, complete the lie. Finish the lie so that it makes sense. Don't cut it off before it is told. The reason why Disney screwed up is because they started of with a lie and then tried to reverse it by telling the truth.

I notice that lots of people have complained about the graphic/visual quality of this particular movie.  Shall I remind them that this movie is produced on a direct-to-video term.  Due to a much lower budget, which is very much obvious in most sequel Disney and other movies anyway, it makes sense that the graphic/visual quality found in Pocahontas II is already expected.

7724615,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Loosely rooted in real American history and based upon people who once actually lived, ""Pocahontas"" is a very different kind of animated classic from the House of Mouse. It's the tale of a beautiful, free-spirited, young (but not as young as Disney's usual) Native American princess who crosses paths with an English explorer named John Smith, only to have romance quickly develop between them. John Smith arrives in the Americas just in time for Pocahontas, who is troubled by her father's wish that she marry hometown hero Kocoum and, confused all the more by a mysterious dream, is in search of a different path to follow. John Smith is also in search of something, and when he finds Pocahontas, he thinks he has found it. The problem is, John is filled with prejudices against Pocahontas and her people, until she shows him the light. She teaches him about the beauty and wonder of nature and how we are all connected to each other. But love makes John an easy sell. His fellow English settlers are not quite so easily convinced. They only see the Indians as dangerous savages that must be destroyed to make the area safe to live in. Matters are made worse by the greed of their leader, Governor Ratcliffe, who is convinced the savages are hoarding the gold he can't seem to find by digging up the land. Their violent actions lead to violent reactions from the tribe, which culminate in a fiery confrontation that only Pocahontas's love and understanding can bring to peace.

The first time I saw Pocahontas, and for long after that, I had mixed feelings about it. I'm a hardcore Disney fan, and there's little I hate more than to be disappointed in a Disney animated feature. Unfortunately, this was something I had to deal with for... possibly the first time ever in theaters upon seeing ""Pocahontas."" Not doubt, ""Pocahontas"" was always a gorgeous film. The art is Disney at its best, and the music and songs are truly beautiful. The comic relief, in the form of Pocahontas's animal friends, is right on the money. The voice cast is top notch, with Mel Gibson as John Smith and Irene Bedard as Pocahontas (Judy Kuhn doing her wonderful singing voice), David Ogden Stiers as Ratcliffe and his servant, Wiggins, Russell Means as Chief Powhatan, Christian Bale, Linda Hunt, and more rounding out the cast, but there was just something missing,...something crucial. I soon decided that the problem was in the villain, Governor Ratcliffe, who just wasn't villain ENOUGH for my tastes. This sudden realization of what was wrong with ""Pocahontas"" was a big mistake, but it's one that is still commonly made. I failed to see then, that the true villain of ""Pocahontas"" is not Governor Ratcliffe at all, but ""prejudice"" itself. This is something that is even pointed out in the DVD's audio commentary, but, of course, I only heard that recently. My bad. I should have been able to see past the expected to the pretty obvious. However, while this knowledge does help improve the movie somewhat, it still doesn't take it from, ""good, but not quite `Disney' good,"" to ""Instant Disney Classic."" As it turned out, the secret lay in a cut musical number: ""If I Never Knew You."" One day, while watching the network television premiere of ""Pocahontas"" on ABC, I learned about a beautiful and wrongfully cut scene from the film in which John Smith, while awaiting his execution, shares a romantic duet with Pocahontas in which the two truly expose their feelings for and to each other. It's the moment in the movie where we truly get the feeling that these two love each other, and not having it in the film was a horrible mistake! And, why did they cut it? Because little kids were bored with it. Thank goodness for DVDs and Special Editions! In this 2-disc, 10th Anniversary DVD release of Pocahontas, that glorious scene has been completed and restored to the film, and it makes all the difference in the world! There's even a new reprise of the song near the end as Pocahontas and John Smith exchange two lines, and that moment will bring you to tears! After finally viewing the movie with ""If I Never Knew You"" intact, I can happily say that ""Pocahontas"" has gone from one of my least favorite Disney films to one of the best! There may be no drop-dead gorgeous, redheaded mermaids and no delightful singing bears, but Disney has managed to take a more real and serious subject and turn it into a wonderful new masterpiece! Now, if they could only fix ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire.""

As for the DVD, this incredible 10th Anniversary Edition is a huge improvement over the Gold Collection release. The film has been digitally remastered and is presented in anamorphic widescreen. Your are given the option of viewing ""Pocahontas"" as it plays, which means the ""extended cut"" with ""If I Never Knew You"" intact, or choosing the shorter, far inferior theatrical cut. Why would anyone want to do that? Still, options are always nice to have. Disc One also includes a fine and informative audio commentary with producer and directors that will only heighten your appreciation of the film. An art project, game, and two sing-along-songs (""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the River Bend"") are included on Disc One as well, along with the Vanessa Williams video for the pop version of ""Colors of the Wind."" Remember how they used to play Disney songs like that on the radio during the Disney Decade? That was so cool.

Disc Two is loaded with great extras for the serious animation enthusiast. There's an enjoyable making-of featurette hosted by Irene Bedard, an early production reel, loads of galleries and clips on one of my favorite subjects: character development (art design, layouts, and backgrounds are also covered), scene production comparison reels, the pop video for ""If I Never Knew You,"" a featurette on the music of the film, and one about the decision to restore the movie's (very necessary) cut scene. One of the highlights of the DVD extras for me was definitely the discovery of the thankfully deleted talking turkey character, Redfeather, while what some might consider a low point is the lack of insight given into the real history behind Pocahontas, Smith, and the others. Further extras include an awesome selection of fascinating deleted scenes, two theatrical trailers, a neat featurette on the movie's ambitious premiere in Central Park (on a row of 8-story movie screens), a multi-language clip reel of the Oscar Winning song, ""Colors of the Wind,"" and a very cool publicity gallery which includes a fun fashion spread from Harper's Bazaar that used Pocahontas as a model! Yes, you get to see Pocahontas drawn in modern clothes, in full color, and she looks darn good, even if I am more of a Tink and Ariel man myself!

The is one DVD Edition I can't recommend enough, primarily because it presents a movie you've seen before as you've never seen it before, and, in this case, I think most people will find the extension to be a huge improvement. Bottom-line, even if you weren't a fan of ""Pocahontas"" before, do yourself a favor and check it out one more time in its extended cut. It's not the same experience.

7724620,5,B01DTNVGYI,"I'm a animated disney film lover, and Pocahontas is my favorite.

I don't care what people say about the relationships, I don't care if people find fault with the strong and sincere character of Pocahontas...

what I DO care about however, is people disliking the movie simply because it's not true to historical fact.  It's Loosely based on history sure, but most fairy tales and films are, and what they evolve into doesn't matter, or Shouldn't matter, as long as the spirit remains the same, and the SPIRIT of Pocahontas is just where it should be.  So if you're going to crit this beautiful and moving animated masterpiece, pick some other aspect of it to attack, or I'll hunt you down.

Another common attack is various reflections on how it's unrealistic.  Seriously.  have you watched any disney films recently?!  Wait, forget that, have you watched ANY films.. ever?  Most aren't realistic.  If you want real, look out the freaking window, go for a walk, live life.

Oh, this movie can't be good, it has Pocahontas talking to animals...  native americans didn't talk to animals, well, first of all, how do we know that she didn't talk to animals?  We all talk to animals, ever yell at your dog?  Ever ask your cat to sit on your lap?  Get a grip, they're cute.

Oh, this movie can't be good,  how do Pocahontas and Smith understand one another?  Listening with your heart?  Seriously? ... YES.  would you rather have them speaking different languages the whole time?  maybe it'd be better if they just ran subtitles for the 3 yr olds.  Or have a 20 minute montage of all the characters going to langage lab.  Ugh.  It's called artistic license, it's not hard to understand.  And if you still are going to fret about that, then remember that most disney films take place in other parts of the world, and Belle and Ariel didn't speak french, and as far as i'm concerned no one can really understand lions, so just shut up right now, unless you are attacking all disney movies, in which case, why the heck did you even come to this page to begin with?

If you don't think you should let your kids watch something so violent, then you shouldn't let them outside the house.  It's freaking PG, chill out, and if you are at the same time  concerned about how it's not accurate, wouldn't the accurate version be a BIT more graphic?!  And If your kids watch this and think it's acutally what happened, then in history class, they will get the real story, or you could tell it to them, no biggie!  But that would involve actually Talking to them instead of just sitting them in front of a movie.  Inaccuaracy in media is a good lesson to learn, no matter the age.  Too many people out there believeing everything thats fed to them.  Question information, and then find yourself some answers!

Okay, that's enough ranting for one afternoon.

PS.  Tell me you don't get goosebumps from just LISTENING to Pocahontas run to the cliff to wave to Smith at the end.  Seriously.",1145577600,12,2968,4.584761904761905
7724621,4,B01DTNVGYI,"In the special features on the Lion King DVD, they were quasi-lamenting that their film was kind of the B team and that Pocahontas was going to be the next big release like Beauty and the Beast. How odd and by how far the underdog team won. Lion King became to be one of the most successful animated films ever, in theatres and home video. Pocahontas on the other hand didn't get favorable reviews and only a respectable box office return. The film isn't Pinocchio or Bambi status by any means but it's sure better than what they've been doing lately, even if it was 10 years ago.

The story centers around Pocahontas living in her village. All is fine until ships from England appear looking for gold. Each group is curious and cautious about the other until Pocahontas meets John Smith, one of the more well-known settlers. So it's a love story set against the backdrop of natives not wanting their land changed and settlers hunting for gold with Pocahontas and John Smith caught in the middle.

What the film has going for it is a rich color palette, quite simply it looks great. It doesn't have that sharpness or finesse like Lion King but it's certainly a colorful film to look at. The songs aren't quite as exciting. What made previous songs work is that they worked independently of the film as well. Under the Sea or Prince Ali works just as fine without the film in front of you. The 2 big songs from here are Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind and only the latter is memorable without seeing the movie.

We can look at the historical changes that Disney made(which you can research, tons of sites) and say they were done for storytelling purposes(apparently Pocahontas was much older than 16 for real, would've been creepy on screen, no?), or say it's pure Disney manipulative trife that messes with things to better suit the story on a $ front. To me it doesn't matter as long as the version they're telling isn't blatantly manipulative. The villain doesn't get a big comeuppance on the likes of Ursula or Shan Yu and the film doesn't end with a big smooch like Aladdin or Hercules but at least it ends properly given the changes.

Pocahontas is part of what is most likely going to be a series of what I call ""Gold Editions"" even though those kind of exist. The big classics like Lion King, Cinderella and Lady and the Tramp got Platinum while Pocahontas, Tarzan, Mulan and most likely Hercules get just a 2 disc edition. It's still nice to own them and Pocahontas is worthy of being included in the Disney shelf, it just may not be your favorite.",1140739200,2,2569,4.518279569892473
7724622,1,B01DTNVGYI,"Disney's fictionalized love story between the 12 year old Pocahontas and the 27 year old John Smith can only leave us praying that this didn't happen in real life. (Pocahantas married John Rolfe when she was 19 and had a child, which is, of course, left out of this movie).

  Even if you get passed the blatant pedophilia overtones, the movie is still filled with bland musical numbers, and boring dialogue.",1137888000,8,408,4.71830985915493
7724623,4,B01DTNVGYI,"I've been loving the story of Pocahontas since I first saw this on video so many years ago - I also saw it at the cinema. I love the fact it's so historical, despite it being based on folklore. I also own a fictional book on it, which extends on much of the stuff in the film. I did look up the straight-to-DVD sequel, but there's no John Smith. :( I was so into Pocahontas, that it made me want to dye my hair black, and grow it long. If I have my hair in braids at work, I even get called Pocahontas. Back in those days, I wanted to be Pocahontas so much, but thankfully, my tastes have changed since swooning over a blonde, clean cut John Smith.

This story is so romantic in every way, from their first meeting, to the finale, and all the scenes in-between. They're so different but so meant for each other. I even liked the new scene, which blends so seamlessly into the film, and seems so familiar, I barely realised that it was a new scene. It also has a brand new song, ""If I Never Knew You"", which was cut after children in test audiences found it boring. OK, it does go over stuff that we already know, and rehashes earlier footage from the film, but it's still one of the best songs.

In the extras, during a very long and interesting The Making Of Pocahontas, the viewers get to see who Pocahontas was based on. Boy was I disappointed! Irene Bedard provided the voice for Pocahontas and the animated character was based on her. I look more like Pocahontas than she does!

What sets this Disney film apart from the others (it was also the last Disney movie I ever watched) is that unlike many Disney movies these days (Shrek for example) nearly every voice in them is a big star, which just so doesn't happen in this film. I much prefer Disney movies when you don't know the voices at the other end. OK, in this movie you have Mel Gibson as the voice of John Smith, but the only other big star is Billy Connolly. (I only just realised this after watching the DVD!) Also the animals don't talk, which is normally a given in Disney movies. It also drags you into the film, until you quite literally fall in love with it. Watching it again after so many years (and now as an adult), made me feel like a little girl all over again, going all gooey over the scenes between Pocahontas and John Smith, and wishing I had it for myself. Amazing how all this stuff can just come straight back to you.

There's been a whole hoo-ha, about how stuff wasn't historically represented, blah blah. It's a Disney movie guys. Come on! If you want to know about the legend of Pocahontas, there's plenty of books out there, I own one, and although I haven't read it in years, I'm definitely going to dig it out again.

This film is an absolute diamond, and is much better than some of the rubbish that Disney decided to churn out after this. It has some of the best songs included in a Disney movie (hello, Colours Of The Wind could be practically considered a classic!). Pocahontas is a strong woman, not afraid to stand up to her father, although I am disappointed she didn't go to England with John. (She does in the book I've read.) The extras are quite good, with the making of going a wee bit into the history of Pocahontas, and showing around Jamestown, and where John Smith originally landed.

I think a lot of people are disappointed with the ending, which historically is the path that Pocahontas does choose....I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Needless to say, it doesn't quite measure up to the original Pocahontas but I thought it was interesting to find out what happens to Pocahontas and John Smith. Younger children will absolutely love part 2 because the story involves Meeko, Flit and Percy quite a bit, and they are pretty quirky!

It wasn't until I heard ""Colors of the Wind"" on the Disney Princess Collection CD that I decided to watch it with my three year old. My daughter enjoyed the movie, but I loved it even more. The music is beautiful, and Judy Kuhn's voice is amazing. Mel Gibson also sings a song with Kuhn, ""If I Never Knew You"" and I thought his voice was pretty amazing too. This movie strays from some of the historical facts/legends of the real Pocahontas, but who cares. Most of us would probably be bored and depressed if the true story of Pocahontas was told in this movie. This is a beautiful love story of two people from two-different worlds who meet under unfortunate circumstances. And the ending isn't predictable like all the other Disney happily-ever-after movies which makes this movie even more heart-felt and intriguing.  I also felt Disney did a wonderful job in sending a message to our children about respecting the land that we have been blessed with. Although some see the portrayal of the greedy settlers as racism (which really it was only one governor in the story who was greedy), I saw it as a lesson for us not to take nature and our surroundings for granted.

The animals in the movie were cute and entertaining for the youngsters; but the story itself is for adults and was beautifully told in a Disney kind-of-magical-way.

And for those who are thinking of buying Pocahontas 2: Journey to A New World... I enjoyed Pocahontas 2: Journey to A New World.

I knew that Disney would twist this important historical event all out of shape, and they did. But after watching it I realized that it is good enough for children, and it might even inspire older children (and adults) to learn more about the real history. I also realized that it would be impossible to make a popular children's animated musical about Pocahontas and the complex interactions, motivations, and tragic outcomes between the English and the Native Americans without simplifying and distorting the story, and I forgive Disney for that. This movie does instill a sense of respect for Native Americans and awe for the glorious land that became America (for better or worse).",1133654400,3,787,4.924812030075188

I wouldn't put it right up there with Nemo or Monsters, Inc., but it's really cute with a fun storyline, and they straighten out the historical inaccuracies a bit from the first one.  Granted, the animation is along the lines of a Saturday morning cartoon, but try to keep in mind that this was a ""straight-to-DVD"" production that was never meant to hit theaters.

7724630,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Pocahontas was the 1995 follow up to Disney's blockbuster success of The Lion King. Although it didn't manage to even gross half of what TLK did, it managed to pull in over $141 million domestically, which is quite respectable. Many don't care for it because of its historical inaccuracies. For a while as of late, I did push it aside and thought that I no longer cared for it like I did. However, when Disney announced a 10th Anniversary 2-Disc DVD, featuring a new extended version of the film with the previously and wrongfully deleted If I Never Knew You song, I decided to get it and gained an all new appreciation for the film, its themes, and its visual beauty...an appreciation I never had at 12 when I first saw it.

The transfer is much better than the Gold Collection DVD, which was riddled with grain and softness. There's not a speck of grain or any other video flaws. Audio is excellent. It's kind of hard to believe Pocahontas is 10 years old. And the film finally feels complete now that If I Never Knew You has been restored into the film.

While not as packed as a Platinum Edition, this DVD is thankfully void of the countless games (Instead, only one game is included here.) and cheesy pop remake videos and gets down to the MEATY stuff. The two videos for the pop songs heard during the end credits ARE here, however, but they all provide nostalgic fun while looking at videos riddled with mid-90's video cliches. Nostalgic fun. Also included is a 28-minute making-of docu produced in 1995 for the Disney Channel. It also includes cliched mid-90's touches. Nostalgic fun, yet again. It's also surprisingly not completely fluffy. Also included are various featurettes on the premiere, the making of the If I Never Knew You scene, and the music, as well as an early presentation reel featuring an early demo of Colors Of The Wind, deleted scenes, and theatrical trailers.

For a non-Platinum disc of a more overlooked film, Disney has certainly given Pocahontas an awesome DVD treatment, complete with a deleted song. I definitely recommend it, and I hope Disney does something similar in 2006 for the 10th Anniversary of another cruelly overlooked classic, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame.",1129075200,8,2205,4.751958224543081

It has been my experience with Disney Dvd that you get the 2 Disc set becuase they always seem to better than the single disc counterparts.  take the limited issue series they are bare bones just liek the gold collections are so if you are a true fan of Disny you want the 2 disc sets.

When I first watched Pocahontas II, I was extremely disappointed to see Pocahontas wind up with John Rolfe.  What happened to John Smith?  Then I went back and reviewed my history and was reminded that Pocahontas DID in fact marry John Rolfe.  While Disney often plays fast and loose with the historical facts, they did get it right on this one.  Overall this is not a bad sequel.",1127260800,3,457,4.592592592592593
7724634,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Pocahontas was, in my opinion, the last great traditional Disney animated film. I was fifteen when it came out, at the age where Disney movies soon became a thing of the past.  I was attracted to Pocahontas for a number of reasons: I had spend childhood spring breaks in Williamsburg, VA and Jamestown, I spent summers Up North running through the woods of Northern Michigan, and ever since childhood, I have been active in Native American culture and crafts: learning the Native American flute, working at powwows, teaching about Native American culture in Quebec, and giving craft demonstrations of making dreamcatchers, among other things.

Very loosely based on the real Pocahontas (who was around eleven or twelve at the time of her encounter with John Smith), Disney's adaptation features all of the Disney prerequisites: talking animal sidekicks, a beautiful, independent heroine, flashy musical numbers, and a love story. However, Pocahontas marked a departure for Disney as well: it was the first film to deviate from the traditional animation style and the first to be based on historical events rather than fairy tales.

To their credit, Disney put a lot of research into the Native American language and customs portrayed in the film. In one interview, the director mentions having a shaman visit the studio, in another segment, a deleted song about Powhatan wedding customs was mentioned for the amount of research. The film also features Native American actors in several roles, including Russell Means (Lakota) as Chief Powhatan, Irene Bedard (Inupiat and Cree) as Pocahontas, Gordon Tootoosis (Cree) as Kekata, and Michelle St. John (Cree) as Nakoma. After watching the bonus material, it is evident what an amazing amount of research and devotion Disney poured into this project. Yes, there are groups that attack the film as a commercial sell-out of Native American culture, but isn't it better to get kids interested in other cultures and traditions from a young age?

Pocahontas is a wild spirit who would rather be canoeing down the river instead of talking about marriage proposals, as her father, Chief Powhatan, wants her to (Pocahontas says of her intended husband Kocoum, ""He's so...serious"").  Adventure comes her way when the dashing soldier John Smith and a shipload of English settlers lands at Jamestown in 1607 (which, ironically, is nowhere near as hilly or lush as the animation would have you believe).  The settlers, driven by the vile Governor Ratcliffe, are sure that the ""savages"" (Native Americans) have hidden the gold that is supposed to be in the New World, and are involved in a number of skirmishes with Pocahontas's tribe.

Pocahontas meets John Smith and it is love at first sight. The two risk everything to be together, but a tragedy threatens to pull them apart. Unlike most Disney films, this one doesn't have a storybook ending (and unfortunately, was yet another victim of the detestable direct-to-video sequels with substandard animation, average songs, and a plot that basically ignored everything that happened in the original film), and was left open ended.

Pocahontas also had one of the most mature and captivating instrumental scores, with a very sweeping, Native-American influenced backing of lush strings, cedar flute, and drums. I didn't care as much for the musical numbers, with the exception of ""Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""Colors of the Wind."" One neat bonus is a multi-language reel of ""Colors of the Wind"" sung in Icelandic, Slovenian, Polish, Korean, Japanese, German, French and French-Canadian, Turkish, Arabic, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few!

For the 10th anniversary edition, Disney has truly outdone themselves with the sheer number of extras: a two-disc set that features new animation and a new song (""If I Never Knew You,"" a duet between John Smith and Pocahontas), a multi-language reel, activities for the kids, including sing alongs, a ""making of,"" and original storyboards and deleted sequences with commentary by the directors, producers, and composers. The film has been completely remastered and is presented in 5.1 digital surround, and sounds better than ever.

A truly beautiful package worthy of my favorite Disney film (and plenty to keep the kids engaged as well!).",1126915200,2,4266,5.1965065502183405

I know that this movie doesn't exactly match the true story of Pocahontas, but I can't think of any other Disney movie based on a fairy tale or story of some sort that does match the story of fairy tale exactly.

7724636,5,B01DTNVGYI,"""Pocahontas"" is the first Disney movie aimed at the adult audience rather than kids. While previous animated features were filled with lots of humor, talking animals/objects/cartoonish-looking characters, ""Pocahontas"" is a complete opposite, therefore it's got many people complaining about. Aside from the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith, the main theme of the movie is the strong message of tolerance, harmony and wisdom. Some viewers need to understand that this film was created to teach our minds and touch our hearts, whereas the entertainment value is not the most important this time.

""Pocahontas"" brings honor to the Native American society, perfectly reflecting the beauty of their world, that was so different than the ""civilized"" one. The Indians are presented as the spiritual people, respecting their land and all the forces of nature. In the most memorable sequence, Pocahontas is singing: ""I know every rock and tree and creature has a life, has a spirit, has a name/ And we are all connected to each other in a circle, in a hoop that never ends"". This message is very inspiring to both adults and children, as nowadays, in the world ruled by money, we're so blinded and preoccupied with the material values, that we forget what's basic and ultimate. In terms of giving a valuable lesson, ""Pocahontas"" is probably Disney's most important movie to date.

Animation and the backgrounds are just stunning. Pastel-dominated color palette makes the film a wonderful visual experience. Unlike ""Aladdin"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Pocahontas"" has far more realistic character design. No huge eyes, no too big heads and anorectic postures; all the characters seem to be made of flesh and blood and are so perfectly animated, that sometimes you forget they're just hand-drawn cartoons. All the animators (we have an excellent opportunity to ""meet"" them, thanks to the bonus material on the dvd) captured the personalities of the characters, transfering their own vision, emotions and sense of style into paper. The most wonderful of them all is, of course, Glen Keane, the Pocahontas' animator who has made an impressive progress since the plain Ariel days. While ""the mermaid"" definitely didn't look top-notch, Pocahontas looks just too good! She's anatomically perfect, she has a beautiful and sophisticated facial features and looks like an extremely talented actress - if it wasn't for the fact she's animated, she could be Hollywood's hottest lady. Oh, and that voice...

The voice actors - while the animator provides the looks, it's the actor who captures the spirit. Spirit of Pocahontas is simply beautiful, thanks to Irene Bedard, who's voice sounds maturer and deeper than any Disney heroine before. Irene, a Native American actress (who looks surprisingly similar to Pocahontas), did an outstanding job making her character unique and multi-dimensional. Irene also hosts ""The Making Of Pocahontas"" available on the 10th anniversary dvd, so we can see how beautiful and lovely she actually is. Another surprise is David Odgen Stiers, a Disney veteran, who's credits include many many characters (f.ex. Cogsworth in ""Beauty & the Beast"") - this time he's a villain,  Governor Ratcliffe, as well as his servant Wiggins (!!!). Ratcliff is a perfectly arogant and wicked huge man, while Wiggins is an annoying little guy - I can't help but admiring this extremely versatile actor. Mel Gibson does a great job as John Smith - I really liked his performance. Pocahontas' father, chief Powhatan is voiced by Russel Means - his deep voice perfectly fits the character. It's no secret that Disney voice casts have always been flawless and this time the voice makeovers are just perfect.

If you're not an animation fan, the reason you should see Pocahontas"" anyway, is the amazingly beautiful music composed by a musical genius, Alan Menken.  ""Pocahontas"" soundtrack is mellower than any of previous Disney soundtracks, as the movie is rather adult-themed. I'm pretty sure that if it wasn't for Menken's music, ""Pocahontas"" wouldn't have been such a remarkable work of art as it is. The soundtrack is engaging on each level - both musically and lirycally (Stephen Schwartz wrote great lyrics). It truly reflects (or maybe creates) the atmosphere of the story. Instrumental tracks are the perfect background to the events of the story - they're very cinematic and telling; there are several moments in the movie when the characters don't need to say anything, for the music says it all. The Broadway style musical numbers are very important to the action - they establish the characters' point of view in a unique and memorable way.

The ""Pocahontas"" leading lady's songs are the true standouts - Pocahontas got to sing the most beautiful and valuable songs the Disney heroine has ever been apriveleged to sing. ""Just Around The Riverbend"" is a lively manifesto of Pocahontas' independent and adventurous spirit - it's the first time in a movie when we begin to love the character. But the strongest moment comes with ""Colors of the Wind"" - Pocahontas' anthem of wisdom, love and harmony - the message of this song is ultimate to our world and all the universe. Listening to ""Colors of the Wind"" is nothing short of unforgettable EXPERIENCE and I believe it's one of the best songs in history (well deserved Academy Award). Pocahontas' singing voice is provided by a Broadway veteran, Judy Kuhn. What's very interesting, she had been casted before they even found a speaking voice of the character. Hearing her voice I can easily see why - Judy has this unique ability to give a strong, emotional performance without getting whiny or trying to hard. Everything's in control yet honest, humble yet impressive, mature yet youthful. That stands for Pocahontas' personality - Judy makes her sound like a self-confident, unapologetic young woman who doesn't want to prove anything, but demonstrates her beliefs and wants to be taken the way she is. I also adore the Polish version of singing Pocahontas, beautifully sung by the wonderful Edyta Gorniak, who sounds different than Judy Kuhn, but is equally perfect.

If you complain that ""Pocahontas"" is not historically accurate, note that in fact it wasn't meant to be. It's based on a legend of Pocahontas, who was the inspiration to make a valuable movie with strong message. So perceive this film as a whole new story and open your mind to enjoy it the way it deserves.  It's a little uncoventional for a Disney film, but that only makes it special.

""Pocahontas"" - this movie is the paradise to the eyes, heaven to the ears, and bliss to the soul. A must-see masterpiece!",1122768000,6,6641,5.078826764436297

Pocahontas had one of the most beautiful scores ever composed. The story is a bit somber, however. Then life doesnt always guarantee a happy ending.

Speaking of such, now that computer generated movies are generating huge box office returns, has Disney halted its old fashioned, time tested hand drawn classics? The subtle beauty of Snow White, Pinocchio and Fantasia are timeless in my book. Theatrical re-releases would be most appropriate.  There are toddlers out there who would approve,I am sure!

As far as DVD is concerned, simple one disc presentations are priceless in my book! There is plenty of room for trailers and featurettes on the classics. Most importantly, the studio should NOT alter the classics other than improving the colors! New songs, new singers and (horrors)new sequences are unforgivable.

Maybe Disney should try to focus on a big production like it left off in the 1990s. Musical numbers, likeable heroes, and carefully hand drawn wonders would surely revive the magic!",1122768000,,1170,5.109947643979058
7724638,5,B01DTNVGYI,"I just got this 10th anniversary edition today and I LOVE it!  The additional scene with the beautiful love song ""If I Never Knew You"" brings the movie all together and it makes much more sense with the scene.  For years I had heard that there was a 'missing scene' in this movie, and I remember thinking how the original scene in the teepee between Pocahantas and John Smith seemed so abruptly cut short and terribly truncated.  About 5 years ago on ABC, The Wonderful World of Disney showed Pocahantas with this 'deleted scene', but it was not complete.  At the time it featured 'live' animation of the view of the hole through the top of the teepee, and stills with voice-overs from Mel Gibson and Irene Bedard. The big deal at the time was that it featured Mel Gibson singing, and I remember seeing an interview with Mel at the time saying (sic) ""I got to sing a love song but they cut the scene!""  But the funny thing is that I could swear that I read that this scene was complete at the time the original was released, but cut just before the release. (Anyone know about this?) I guess it doesn't matter now because the Disney Co. finally restored this very touching and beautiful song to this anniversary version, and it makes the story so much more real and compelling.  There is also a reprise of the couple singing the song just before the end and it is the icing on the cake.  I'm not always pleased with Disney DVD releases, but this one they got right! Also, they had the sense to release it in the widescreen ratio so you get to see the whole, beautiful product in all of its glory!  (They should do this with all their releases!--How about a widescreen special edition of MoonSpinners? Hint-Hint!)

7724640,3,B01DTNVGYI,"I've watched many Disney feature length cartoons over time and this one is one of the most sedate ones I have ever seen. This might actually be good if your children tend to get wired watching some of the company's more antic characters and sidekicks. But, for me, it was lacking in that punchy charm I've come to expect with Disney characters.

One feature of every Disney story is that the main characters get sidekicks who act as comic relief. They tend to be eccentric people or intelligent and comedic animals. The ship's captain has a gaggle of interesting and crusty sailors by his side. The bad guy has a very quirky and cute little dog. But poor little Pocahontas gets one comical mammal and a hummingbird. The hummingbird just does not work as a comic sidekick. Its too tiny to have facial expressions and really is a one note joke. The other people in her group are toothachingly beautiful and heroic and lacking in any humor.

This is really sad. If you want to educate non-Indians about Indians, you really miss the point without the sense of humor. It isn't politically incorrect to have an irritable Iroquoi or a cheeky Cherokee or a silly Seneca. Really. Its OK. I think the movie was poorer for the gravity of the tribespeople.

Another thing that got me was that they had to use a willow tree as a female advisor to Pocohontas. Why not an elder woman? With a sense of humor? I think of the wonderful old women in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Spirited Away"".

7724642,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Beauty and the Beast's ""Human Again"" carries a cute scene between Belle and Beast but is ultimately unnecessary; The Lion King's ""Morning Report"" appears out of place and painfully disrupts the flow of the film; Pocahontas' ""If I Never Knew You"", however, is exactly what the movie needed to be complete.

A duet never should have been left out in the first place, ""If I Never Knew You"" is a melodically poetic, lyrically poignant exchange of singing dialog that authenticates Pocahontas and John Smith's feelings for each other, speaking of how lacking life would be if they never knew each other.  The reprise well placed near the end of the film also dose a great job at evoking strong emotions and adds power to the bittersweet ending of this courageous romantic tale.

If I had only one misgiving about this effort, however minor, it would be that the animation accompanying the beautiful music had some room for improvement.  There are a few moments there where the two leads look just a little bit ""off"" (not looking like themselves), especially in John Smith's case.  Other than that, the added sequences are simply stunning.  I especially love the segment where the ""camera"" moves from John Smith's looking up at the nightly sky to Pocahontas' paddling away towards Grandmother Willow's canopy.  Trying not to give away anything, I'll just say that it has a lot of magic and symbolic meaning while echoing an earlier scene in the movie.

All in all, this special 10th anniversary edition of Pocahontas is a marvelous venture worthy of the Disney name and the love and loyalty of its fans.  Now that I've seen this version of the film I will never go back to the original, for this is what it always should have been.",1116892800,3,1725,4.761744966442953
7724643,1,B01DTNVGYI,"OK, I am an 18 year old who loves Disney and most things that Disney does... but for once..I HATE THIS MOVIE!!

OK! I got the first Pocahontas many years ago and I absolutely love it! It is just my favourite Disney movie ""Two different worlds, one true love"" And I think we must all agree that John Smith is gorgeous!

So..Pocahontas 1 has a fantastic storyline , beautifully drawn, lovely music ""colours of the wind"" is like my favourite Disney song. Yes and it has many unforgettable characters like Thomas. And like I said before...it was beautifully drawn, all little details of Grandmother Willow...it was just beautfiul!!

After I watched the first one..I was like ""when will the second one come out?? I want to see Pocahontas and John SMITH getting back together! Because the ending is just so sad!""

Then FINALLY the second one came out and I was reading about it and JOHN ROLFE??????????? WHAT?????????????

So I was disappointed with the first 5 min of it..I am an Industrial Design Student and I have always wanted to work for Disney and just look at the pictures!! Everythings like 2D!!! It was 3D in the first one!! Badly drawn...best example - Grandma Willow..her skin is like smooth! She's an old tree!!!! And look at John Smith..he doesn't even look handsome anymore..which is disappointing. And when did he have orange hair??

No real good music like ""colours of the wind"" The movie wasn't funny...like everyone have said...they all changed their personality..John Smith wasn't like that!!!!!!!! They were in love! GRRR I am so angry!!! Smith and Poca. were meant to be together forever and ever!

So yes, I wish I have never watched this so I keep on thinking that they are still together in spirit like how the first one ended.

I really can't wait to finish university and apply for a job at Disney and maybe suggest a creation of Pocahontas 3!!LOL

7724644,5,B01DTNVGYI,"If you're looking for Pocahontas just for the kiddies, then it doesn't matter if you buy this edition or the older one.  But if you're an adult fan of Disney, you'll definitely want the 10th Anniversary DVD.  First, I compared both versions on in a high-end home theater with a 133"" projection screen.  The older DVD was very grainy and the colors were washed out.  On this edition, the picture was simply stunning.  It is crystal clear with beautiful colors.  This is a DVD to pop in and show off your home theater.  The audio is superb.  Second, if you are a fan of Pocahontas, then the added scenes are worth the price alone.  I can see why the song was originally cut.  It probably seemed odd to have Smith singing while tied up.  Those restored scenes really belong.  If you're a crier then make sure you have a box of tissues handy.  With the amazing quality and new scenes, it was like watching it for the first time.  Highly recommended!!!",1116028800,,947,4.461988304093567

Pocahontas' story in London was magical and wonderful, and acted perfect when she faced the king and the queen of England.

7724646,4,B01DTNVGYI,"This review is tough to write. Firstly, this dvd was sent to me ""free"" via Amazon for being the amazing reviewer I am:) Well, it was sent to me free, anyway, there is a such thing as a free lunch!

This definitely is not a dvd I would have purchased for myself. Not because I do not like animation, but because of the subject matter and from clips I had seen. However, I was surprised. Not overwhelmed, but surprised. The voice casting is very strong in the starring roles however the animal cast aimed obviously at the youngsters did sort of grate. The animation as far as backdrops were often stunning and are Disneys general level of perfection, not quite Lion King but still very good. The extra's are certainly more than I would expect from a movie not quite a blockbuster and pretty much nail all the loose ends fans of this movie could ever hope to see.

Still, having almost nothing negative to say I still get a feeling this movie is aimed at youngsters. There is an interesting story underneath but it is layered under an icing more suited for a young pallette. It goes without saying that if you are a Disney-hound or a small girl, this DVD set is a must, all others should wait... and hope.",1115856000,,1202,4.40990990990991
7724647,5,B01DTNVGYI,"History's most well known heroine of American history or legend known as Pocahontas is a free-spirited native American princess who has a demanding father but wants to follow her spirit of what would be her destiny and has the guidence of grandmother willow with the help of two friends, a racoon named Meeko and a hummingbird named ""Flit"". Settlers from England land on the shores of Virgina to find gold, but when captain John Smith is exploring around the place he falls in love with Pocahontas and she falls in love with him but soon war has begun between the two races as only love must conquer the war and hatred.

A visually stunning and breathtaking yet serious disney animated feature which is after the success of ""The Lion King"", many have accused this movie of being historically inaccurate but relax folks it's only a movie, not all movies ( animated or live action) have to follow exactly to history or a legend. This features of the voices of Mel Gibson, Beauty and The Beast's David Ogen Stiers, Irene Bedard, Russell Means, Christian Bale, Linda Hunt and Billy Connelly and stunning artwork with a great soundtrack by Aladdin's, Beauty and The Beast's and Little Mermaid's Alan Menken including the memorable ""Colors of the Wind"" song.

The new 2-Disc DVD is a slight improvement over the previous DVD but with better picture & excellent sound quality thanks to THX, it contains two versions such as the new 10th Anniversary special edition with a new animated musical segment that was cut out called "" If i never knew you"" and the original theatrical cut, with extras like games, audio commentary, art galleries, featurettes, multi-language reel, behind the scenes, Publicity and more.

The movie may not be as good as ""Mulan"" though for a Disney movie based on a legend, but it's still a must have for every animation collector's DVD library, this movie is guaranteed to make the viewer cry and laugh then have fun.",1115769600,5,1934,4.801801801801802
7724648,5,B01DTNVGYI,"In 1995, Disney released its 33rd animated feature, Pocahontas, having cut the song ""If I Never Knew You"" from the motion picture. Ten years later, the folks at the House of Mouse re-add this beautiful sweeping love ballad back to this masterpiece, and the result is a feeling of satisfaction complete with goosebumps, teary eyes, and the fulfillment knowing Pocahontas is now complete. This 10th Anniversary Edition makes Pocahontas better than ever, and after viewing it, I am proud to put Pocahontas back at the top of my favourite Disney movie list. I just hope that 20 years from now, this final and complete version of the film will be the one audiences will remember, the one Disney will be promoting, the one audiences will be watching time and time again. Of all of Disney's animated full-length features, the love story found in ""Pocahontas"" is the most intense, the issues the most real, and the animation and music the most breath-taking and beautiful. If you've never seen Pocahontas, or haven't watched it in years, give Pocahontas: The 10th Anniversary Edition a try, and you might end up asking yourself, ""If I never knew you...""",1115251200,6,1145,4.907216494845361
7724649,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Even with its minor flaws, this film still stands, in my opinion, as one of Disney's greatest achievements.  Following the phenomenal success of ""The Lion King"" the previous year, ""Pocahontas"" was considered a dismal failure in 1995, as it barely made over 100 million at the box office.  True, there was no room for hyenas marching in lockstep or lusting French candlelabras, but what the Disney artists accomplished was that necessary next step in the art of animation.  Also true is the lack of historic accuracy to what little is known of Pocahontas and John Smith, and the fact there is no proof they were ever romantically linked.  But if historic accuracy was the most important criteria in filmmaking, ""Pocahontas"" would have been nothing more than an animated documentary.

Some viewers may be missing the point if they try to compare this movie with other Disney gems like ""Snow White"" or ""Cinderella"".  Pocahontas is portrayed here as a grown woman, and not a teen or ""Little Mermaid"".  Her romance with Smith is a strong lesson that love levels all barriers, even racial ones.  To me, this film was Disney's first attempt at an animated film with more adult values, a concept that should make both adults and children happy (and I always thought ""Pocahontas"" was a great ""date"" movie).  The Disney Studio should be commended in their efforts in this regard.

The discs we have here are not as well filled as that of ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Lion King"", although Disney correctly included the half hour documentary, hosted by Irene Bedard (the speaking voice of Pocahontas), that was televised on the Disney Channel when the film was originally released.  Also included is a film commentary by the producer and the two co-directors of the film.

The big selling point in this release is the inclusion of the  song, ""If I Never Knew You"", that was cut from the theatrical version (which also reappears as a reprise in the final scene).  Artistically, the song is necessary to solidly reinforce how much Pocahontas and Smith mean to each other (besides being a most beautiful composition).  But the viewer may decide its inclusion is unacceptable.  So Disney has given viewers two film choices, with the added song seamlessly inserted in the anniversary edition.

The film has undergone some amazing remastering, with far brighter colors and sharper lines than before.  Heavy film grain was a major distraction at the theater, on the VHS tape, and the original DVD, with flat areas appearing to dance about like ants.  But now, the image is smooth and beautiful.  Clearly ""Pocahontas"" is now close to the perfection it never was in the past.  The sound has a bit more gusto when heard in surround sound (thanks to THX), but the new remastering is barely noticable when heard on the TV alone.  Compared with the original DVD, the video difference is stunning.  Characters' movements seem more fluid this time around, and the sharpness of the outlines emphasize facial expression better.

The previous DVD listed the aspect ratio as 1.66:1, which was incorrect - it was actually closer to 1.50:1.  For the new DVD, we are given the ratio of 1.66:1, allowing more image left and right, but neither DVD has presented the film in the theatrical release ratio of 1.85:1.

For anyone who already has the previous DVD of ""Pocahontas"", an additional purchase may not be deemed necessary.  But for everyone else, this immaculate new presentation is a must have.",1115164800,3,3466,4.890410958904109
7724650,4,B01DTNVGYI,"When ""Pocahontas"" was first released in theatres 10 years ago (damn I'm getting old!), I was still in my ""everything Disney is good"" phase and I bought the companion soundtrack to the movie.  My favorite song from was the CD was ""If I Never Knew You,"" sung by Jon Secada and Shanice, but I was curious as to why it was on the soundtrack when it wasn't in the movie.  Well a couple of years ago when ""Pocahontas"" aired on ABC's Wonderful World of Disney, they showed the deleted scene where Mel Gibson sings the song in the film.  It was wonderful.  I was so disappointed that the filmmakers chose to cut that scene because the song is great and it adds an emotional resonance that most critics accused the film of lacking.  (The scene occurs the night before John Smith's scheduled execution when Pocahontas goes to visit him.)  I was further disappointed when ""Pocahontas"" was released on DVD and Mel's song wasn't on it.  Well, ten years later, Disney finally got a clue and we'll actually get to see and hear the song in the context of the movie.  Granted ""Pocahontas"" doesn't compare to ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" but 10 years later it's still alive and kicking.  If you enjoyed the movie then, you'll more than appreciate Mel's musical contribution to the film now.",1115078400,3,1286,4.580786026200873

Well, Pocahontas dispelled that myth.  While this 10th anniversary edition was carefully put together, it does not hide the fact that at its core is a severely flawed and uninspired movie.  The movie's slow pace makes it somewhat difficult to watch despite the brilliant colors and awesome sound.  Disney fans are used to action and adventure appearing at expected and unexpected moments.  And there's always a love story somehwere.  Pocahontas, however,  is almost devoid of any action and really does not have a love story.  For that matter, there isn't much of any kind of  story.  I am sure that Pocahontas, a legendary figure in our history, deserved a much better treatment that this hauntingly weak Disney dud.",1114992000,10,870,4.890410958904109
7724652,5,B01DTNVGYI,"What's all the fuss about?  I was around 10 yrs old when I first whatched this movie and I thought and still think it's great. The animation was well drawn, especially the ""colors of the wind"" part. The musics were very strong (don't miss out near the end music, it really rises your spirit). And 1 or 2 songs of Disney's Pocahontas were really meaningfull. Overall it deserves a good rating.

But why all the complaints?

People that gave bad ratings mostly complained about the inaccuracy of the movie portraying the history. Even History itself is not true. History is just a recording made by us, even they who wrote it can alter it. For instance, our American History wrote about Columbus being the first to discover America; in fact he is the last, actually never did reached America. People who complained are scared that their children will get the wrong ideas of history. I first watched it before I learned the ""Truth"" as well, and now I'm 20 and well aware of the true history of Pocahontas, and no I'm not affected by Disney's version. I can manage to seperate history from fantasy.

And I realized how many complained about racial issue; Caucasians complained about the appearence of white people and that they are the ""badguys"" in the movie. Native Americans complained that the movie protrayed them as savages. In this movie I only saw 1 villian and of course it's Ratcliff. Now the movie titled Pocahontas, you can assume it's about the Native Americans. And that's why the movie focus the character appearence more on Native Americans than on Caucasians. As for most of Disney's movie; the main focused characters will always appear more pleasent than the sides or the villians. I bet no one will complain about racial issue if both versus are the same race. I also don't see any savageness portrayed in the movie both Caucasians and Native Americans. If you think about it, Ratcliff promised gold in the new land. Who wouldn't turn greedy hearing about it, espeacially being a peasant back in England. Therefore it's reasonable why the Native Americans felt threaten and set up a defense (You would be if someone you don't know move in with you, and not knowing their purpose). And so war came about b/c both don't understand each other's purpose in the land; where one wants gold and the other won't share land. When both don't understand each other they both consider each other savages.

To end myself, you would enjoyed it greatly if you set history and racial issues aside. Don't just consider your point of view but open yourself up. This movie actually brings meaning than controversy...",1114041600,6,2612,4.769911504424779
7724653,5,B01DTNVGYI,"I saw this film yesterday after buying the DVD, and boy was I impressed!

The story, the music, the colours, this whole film was simply spectacular and so beautiful! The lessons it teaches, and not just learning to accept other people different from yourself, but I felt particularly moved by Pocahontus's love of nature, and her closeness to the land in which she lives.

Colours of the wind is of course the perfect song to show this, and is so beautiful to watch.

This is truly a Disney classic, maybe more for the grown ups than little kids, but a classic none the less.

And oh yeah, for those who say the history was wrong and this had ruined part of history? what about just pretending that this is just another normal Disney film?

7724658,2,B01DTNVGYI,"When I first saw Pocahontas years ago as a child, I was entranced with its beauty and charming story.  I still am- but only with the former.  Pocahontas has arguably the most stunningly gorgeous animation of any Disney movie.  Unfortunately, beauty of any kind is rarely seen outside of the movie's backdrop.  Everywhere from beginning to end is fraught with violence, and while the violence never bothered me, it is the hypocritical way the stereotypes are played off of it that did.  The English are all cartoonish (granted, this is a cartoon but this is really excessive, similar to depictions of the Romans in paintings of Jesus), except for the heroically Aryan Smith.  Meanwhile, the Powhatan are proud and noble-looking with dream bodies.  Also, the Powhatan are displayed as peace-loving people who want only to be one with nature, but they are really just as ""savage"" as their British counterparts (for instance, even though they may sing about how seasons go and seasons come, steady as the beating drum, their happiness stems from a war victory).  Then, there are a plethora of historical innaccuracies, but to expect Disney to conform to the story of an eleven year old, somewhat unattractive native girl who later dies of syphillis and an exploitave white man who are nothing more than friends would not make for good movie-watching, so I wish that people would stop whining about this particular aspect.  All the same, the movie-watching isn't great for any conciensious adult.  The double standards and stereotyping totally belie the movie's message of tolerance.  While I understand that many tribes felt a special connection with nature, I don't believe anyone would go so far as to tell everyone that she heard a talking tree telling her to listen with her heart (not to mention that Smith can see the tree too, showing that her communication isn't solely with the tribe).  And the chief is hardly condemned for almost bringing a bloody death on a framed Smith, because the chief is just a poor victim of the vicious, greedy and suspiciously Jewish-looking Governer Radcliffe anyway.  The songs are all right but often preachy and, once again, stereotyping.

7724659,4,B01DTNVGYI,"For those who use history as the basis for hating this film, get over it.  Disney was not telling the history of Pocahontas, but the LEGEND of Pocahontas.  As with many historical figures, there are legends surrounding who Pocahontas was, so let's actually look at some of the other big complaints.

1.  They made Pocahontas look much older.  Well, duh.  Do you really want Disney to do a love story of a 12 year old girl and a 30 year old man.  How would that have gone over?  Of course, if they are going to tell the love story, they are going to make the main characters adults.

2.  The sequel shows Pocahontas marrying John Smith.  Apparently you slept through the sequel because it is clear that she chooses John Rolfe in the sequel. (Yes, historically she marries him, converts to Christianity, changes her name to Sarah, and dies before leaving England of syphillis.)  But again, do you really want to explain to your child that this American heroine died of syphillis?

3.  The animal companions/talking tree.  These are representative of the spirit of nature which is sacred to many Native American tribes.

Again, Disney does a really good job of telling the legend.  They never have claimed historical accuracy, because that is not the story they are telling.  Truthfully, the lessons here are wonderful lessons.",1104624000,12,1324,4.783185840707965

We used to have a movie near to dismissal time so as to keep the kids entertained while we closed it down for the day.  I have to say that it took every bit of my willpower to keep from ripping the tape out of the VCR and showing something else.

Who does Disney really think they are?  How dare they take our American history and ruin it?  I can understand sanitizing Grimm fairy tales for modern children (to an extent though it's nothing I am fond of), but sanitizing American history?!

Disney had no business doing this movie if they are so afraid to tell the story as it was. An entire generation of kids are going to grow up with the wrong idea about what really happened.

People need to look past the off-kilter history behind the movie and look at the amazing story of love, hate, and action that is portrayed.  This movie, along with ""Moonstruck"", made me cry.  The movingly wonderful message of how you do not love with your eyes, but with the wisdom of your great-grandma, who happens to be a tree, and also with your heart.  I'm pretty sure that Disney was not trying to inform you of Pocahontas's life and death, but merely of a lesson we all need to realize: the road to being respected by your father requires staying steadfast to your lover and to be somewhat dramatic and sacrafice your life for your convictions.  Though I am over the age of thirteen, I sometimes pretend I am Pocahontas, and sing catchy tunes and stand on top of rocks and wave goodbye to my lover.

Now, it wasn't the entire John Rolfe thing that bugged me. I'll admit that I didn't like him, but it wasn't because I'm such a huge John Smith/Pocahontas fan; it was because he was such a boring, humdrum character. The entire story was rushed and just felt so very unncessary. It lacked the dynamic, mood, charm, and heart of the first ""Pocahontas."" Coincidentally (although not surprisingly), it also lacked the good music.

The real kicker is, I can hardly remember anything concrete about this movie. I remember having seen it a few times and having absolutely hated it, but it's surprisingly forgettable. The only thing is that I can't forget that I actually watched it and that it nearly burned out my retinas and destroyed a few of my brain cells in the process. I oh-so-honestly wish that I could un-watch this heinous direct-to-video sequel (or that Disney would disown it and say they weren't at all thinking straight when they decided to create it), because it was so bad that it nearly ruins the original movie for me.",1100908800,10,1302,4.706140350877193
7724663,5,B01DTNVGYI,"I'll start by saying that ""Pocahontas"" is my absolute favorite Disney animation ever. Yes, it is different from Disney's other animation offerings, and this is what I loved (and still love) about it. It's a much more serious film and the so-called ""muted, dull"" colors used only reinforce this. It's supposed to be intense and make you feel something other than ooey-gooey waffiness. For Disney romance buffs, the love story between John Smith and Pocahontas unfolded... so beautifully, I get teary-eyed just thinking about it. It's a love based on mutual understanding and respect and watching it blossom is a treat in itself. The bitter-sweet conclusion only adds to the intensity of it all (and I'm still--after several years--trying very hard to forget about the steaming pile of turd that was ""Pocahontas II""). Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

The characters all had their own vivid personalities and I agree with those who've said that Pocahontas (Disney's Pocahontas, for all you ""history"" fanatics out there) is an amazing young lady. She's different from Disney's other, more light-hearted heroines. The film is different from Disney's other, more light-hearted ones. If this is not your cup of tea, then that's really a huge shame. However, I think that just about anyone can truly enjoy this film if they'd just throw aside any preconceived notions and just watch; just enjoy it for what it is.

A little aside: The people who've written enraged reviews saying that Disney's ""Pocahontas"" wasn't historically accurate and therefore dreck, should just get rid of their DVDs and never speak of this film EVER again (please, for the sake of my SANITY). What were the lot of you expecting, exactly? This is a Disney film, for crying out loud, not a blasted History Channel program. Also, those saying the racism in it was horrid/unnecessary/etc... well I'm sorry, but that's just about the entire point of this story; the message being that racism is BAD and that we should all try and accept differences and understand eachother, for nothing good can come out of hatred. This isn't even presented to the audience in symbolism, it's up-in-your-face clear. I just can't believe that it eluded so many people.",1100908800,5,2214,5.079670329670329

7724670,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Don't watch Pocahontas if you're expecting a historical lesson. As usual, Disney takes liberty with its adopted tale of the young Powhatan girl who saved the life of an English settler. In true history she was only twelve years old; in Disney's romanticized version, she is a beautiful woman who falls in love with the handsome, dashing John Smith. Historically inaccurate? Yes. A beautiful, highly enjoyable film? Absolutely.

 The film opens with a group of English settlers crossing the Atlantic to colonize Virginia, led by the greedy Governor Ratcliffe and the adventurous John Smith. We are later introduced to Pocahontas, a beautiful and bright young woman on the brink of adulthood, searching for her place in the world. A star-crossed meeting with John Smith forges a friendship between the two that will later blossom into romance. They explore one another's culture; Pocahontas introduces Smith to her love of nature in the film's most beautiful and breathtaking song, ""Colors of the Wind."" But Ratcliffe thinks Pocahontas' tribe is hiding mounds of gold and is determined to strip them of their riches, while the Chief Powhatan, Pocahontas' father, regards the white settlers as dangerous, invading demons.

 Though Disney has its typical boo-hiss villain in Ratcliffe, the film's conflict is not black and white; neither the Native Americans nor the white settlers are portrayed as evil. Instead, both are carefully crafted with their own hopes and dreams, as well as natural prejudices toward the opposing, unknown culture. The film's message of understanding and racial tolerance is a bit heavy-handed but otherwise inspiring, as is Pocahontas' love and respect for nature, beautifully expressed in the awe-inspiring, Oscar-winning song ""Colors of the Wind."" Pocahontas has bust but also brains, and the compassion and courage to make a stand for peace between her people and the settlers.

 Having always been a romantic, the high point of the film for me is also the most historically inaccurate--the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. What starts as simple curiosity in one another blossoms into love, culminating in the film's single but very sensual kiss. Though my opinion is not widely shared, I think this film is one of Disney's best in the romance department.

 The obligatory cute-n-fuzzy animals, a mischievious raccoon, pesky hummingbird, and spoiled pug, provide some mild amusement, but I personally think the film could have done without them. The music is good but not spectacular, the exception of course being ""Colors of the Wind"". The animation is rendered in soft, dreamy pastels of mainly green, blue, and gray; while not as beautiful as some of its predecessors, such as Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, it's a lovely effort.

 A beautiful, compassionate film, Pocahontas is a worthy Disney feature and, in my humble opinion, deserving of the title ""masterpiece.""",1090540800,4,2919,5.2312633832976445
7724671,1,B01DTNVGYI,"I wish my children had never seen this movie, but since I made the mistake of trusting Disney and since it reappears on TV frequently, I've used it as an opportunity to talk about the blatant (but politically-correct) racism woven through it.  My point to my children:  racism is wrong, no matter who it's directed at (a point that goes directly against the main theme of the movie).
In this movie, there is one and only one exception to the rule that all Native Americans are good and all English are bad.  John Smith is the exception that proves the rule - other than him, all British are evil (and crude, dirty, greedy, etc.).  The Native Americans aren't all quite perfect but all come around in the end, while the English are clearly rotten to the core, and the world would be a better place if they were all gone.
Get this movie for your children IF you want to teach them to use skin color as a way of predicting good versus evil.

allthough im not sure if the hole ball thing was actually a reference to hitory (i suspect not)i think that was completely FAKE and unrealistic. and since when has pocahontas been able to speak english?!? i know that in the first movie she and john smith could speak in the same languge but 1) you don't know what language that is 2)that was only because the tree did something weird.
was it js me or did pocahontas look completely hidious for a cartoon in this movie?
everyone was SO(...) mean to the little dog (what was his name?!?). pocahontas was hugin meeko all the time but she ignored the dog untill the end. meeko was just evil to the dog, apart from in the rare occasions that he was being sweet to the dog. bt i will admit that meeko (and the dog, and, yes, evan flit) was sooooooooooooo CUTE!
finally, the RUBBISH ending. firstly, pocahontas rejects john smith, who is like, the love of her life(in the first movie anyway)!!!!!! he was completely cool with it as well. she was like ""we walked the same path once, but no i know my place."" and he was like ""i hope you find happiness."" ok. im 13 and i definately know that my boyfriend isn't long term but evan if HE rejected me like that i would proabl slap him. and john smith was like THE LOVE OF HER LIFE. and then, to make it worse, she went with that pathetic excuse for an animated character JOHN ROLFE who had an unaturally posh accent anf ""falls in love with him"". THAT WAS  W(...)-R(...)-O(...)-N(...)-G(...).!(...)
and john smith was SO(...) SWEET to her throughout the entire movie. one of the fisrt things he said to her were ""ive though about you every day!"" that was soo sweet. and pocahontas still loved him at the begining. SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH JOHN SMITH!!!!!!! like ive already said THE ENDING WAS WRONG!!!! walt disney movies always have the same two messages
""friendship""
and
""TRUE LOVE""

Where to start with this movie?  The history, or lack thereof?  One could spend hours discussing Disney's shredding of history in this movie, and certainly, many previous reviewers have levelled ample criticism at Disney for the copious inaccuracies.  Suffice it to say, I do not approve of the idea that we should somehow whitewash history to make it more appealing to modern-day sensibilities.  What kind of message does that send to our children?  I agree that little kids probably aren't ready for the reality of European conquest of the New World; in that case, tell them the historical truth when they are ready to handle it.  Don't lie to them, and don't package those lies in some cutsey cartoon.
Was the historical inaccuracy of this movie my real problem?  Not particularly; I have come to expect such willful distortions from Disney in most of its ""adaptations"" of literature (Hunchback of Notre Dame), history & mythology (Hercules).  It really is par for the course with The Mouse.  My real problem comes from the fact that the movie is truly unbearable to listen to, thanks to the high-pitched caterwauling of Judy Kuhn (Irene Bedard having provided the speaking voice for the indian princess).  Sorry dear, but screeching high & loud with a wobbly vibrato does not good singing make.  It does make my head throb with pain, though.  It didn't matter where I was in the house, I could hear Judy screaming at me, as though she were stalking me.  This made for a particularly bad Disney soundtrack, which is indeed saying something.

7724686,1,B01DTNVGYI,"First off, I loved the first Pocahontas.  That is, until I saw this one.  Now I can never really enjoy it to the same level again, at least not until a few years from now when I've forgotten about this awful thing.
While it's wonderful that Disney attempted to set things right, they couldn't have done it in any worse way.  I hated Rolfe from the beginning; he never develops once.  That's pretty tough considering that he's the ""romantic hero""... and pretty much having a romance is an easy way to develop someone.  Not this guy, though, he's about as endearing as a steel pole.
I hate the tea chick, which is what I'm going to call her for lack of knowing her name.  The woman, to whose charge Pocahontas is placed, seems like a feeble attempt to make me like John Rolfe: ""Oh, he and this sweet if blundering old lady have an affectionate relationship!  He's a good guy after all!  Oh Pocahontas, soon you'll see that!""  BLECH, it was so painfully obvious that she was just an attempt at character development that didn't quite work.  The only thing she was good for was actually inspiring what was close to laughter... although that was only twice.  Wiggins in the first movie, however, puts the tea chick to shame.
I'm going to admit that I HATE the ending.  Who the heck cares if it's more historically accurate?  The point is that if you're going to be historically inaccurate, go all the way!  I absolutely loved the Smith/Pocahontas thing in the first movie because both were passionate, lived for danger and excitement, and had as much chemistry as people in animated movies can  have.  Their relationship is well-developed, as are both people as they kind of come to terms with each other's culture.
John Rolfe, though?  He is pompous from the beginning until the horribly forced ending.  I'm not sure if it was just me, but it really seemed like he only liked Pocahontas after she had become ""civilized.""  John Smith liked her for who she was, not because she was dolled up in a painful musically-challenged sequence that made me think of ""You'll Bring Honor to Us All"" from Mulan with sheer longing.  Speaking of which, I don't understand what John Rolfe was on--she looked HIDEOUS in that getup.
The animals also seemed to be an attempt to make John Rolfe more likable, because we're supposed to think ""Hey, the animals want them together, and they want what's best for Pocahontas so that must be what's best for her!""  Pfff, that just made me hate Meeko and Flit.
Actually, the whole London song made me think of a bad attempt to mime Bonjour from Beauty and the Beast.  I really think that Pocahontas would have found the city intrusive and smelly, because think of the change she would have went through.
And yes, I agree that John Smith was 100% percent, unadulterated, pure Out-of-Character.  I saw and agree with a previous review that stated that they seemed to want to make him a jerk so we wouldn't feel bad about Pocahontas ditching who had once been ""the love of her life.""  Disney, however, seems to have forgotten that they spent an entire movie making him likable and a worthy match for their almost overly-glorified heroine.  To just throw that away almost makes me sick; why bother watching the first movie with ""She's going to eventually screw him over"" hanging over your head.
Actually, I didn't like Pocahontas either.  She seemed OOC as well; certainly the Pocahontas in movie one would not have accepted a man who seemed to ring more of Radcliffe than anything.  And that Pocahontas would not have let John Smith go.  Then again, that wasn't really John Smith and it wasn't really Pocahontas either.  I don't know who these two were, but I certainly didn't like them.  I liked them more, though, than I liked Rolfe.  Which says a lot.
Oh, they needed some cameos.  Thomas, Wiggins (he would have made this movie worthwhile), etc.
I agree that Radcliffe was totally demonized.  I actually had some sympathy for him in the first one, since it was made clear that he was just trying to succeed at something and prove the others at court, who hated him, wrong.  Although he was villainized a lot in the first, it pales in comparison to the second.  I also agree that it was crazy that James believed him.  James, too, was a cartoony 2d character.  Poor guy, the movie insults him more than anyone.
And yeah, I also found it weird that Pocahontas knew about John Smith's death.
Basically, I'm just saying that you should either not watch this movie, forget about it, and/or just plain pretend that it doesn't exist.  I can't wait until I forget about this awful thing and can enjoy the first one and I used to be able to do.",1063497600,71,4654,4.603155339805825
7724687,5,B01DTNVGYI,"I was a very precocious child; when this movie first came out I was in elementary school and would rant to anyone who'd listen about the historical inaccuracies.  Even after seeing the movie in theater I carried that opinion, and it wasn't until recently that it changed.  So, for those of you who complain that your kids won't know any better... give them more credit.  Even if you do tell them, they probably won't care.  Why?  Because kids don't nitpick; if they like it, they like it.  I wish that I had been that way, it's a part of childhood that I never had a chance in which to partake.
Anyway, two weeks ago or so my AP US History teacher showed a clip of the movie in his class while we were learning about the London Company and so forth.  Before you have a chance to gasp over the horror that this abomination to history was actually shown in a history class, let me just say that my teacher told us that it was exaggerated but there was some truth to it (it was the Dig song)
In my opinion, that statement holds true for the entire movie.
First off, I can tell that Disney did take time to do research.  They didn't just make it up entirely.  I was most impressed with the references: King James, the Virginia Company, the idealism that the settlers carried, especially ""the white man's burden"" were all pretty true to history whether or not we can accept that.  The Indians were pretty much portrayed as every Indian is portrayed in these kinds of movies, but like everyone else in the movie were exaggerated.
As someone who absolutely abhors Hercules this may be hypocritical, but I think that we should look past the historical inaccuracy in Pocahontas, because the greater messages are true.  And I think that if you view it as a separate tale, one that didn't really occur, you'll like it a lot more.
I do not understand how people can criticize the music.  It's absolutely beautiful, and the constant background music adds so much to the effects of the gorgeous animation.  And as a huge Judy Kuhn fan, the singing was lovely.  The only thing with which I had a problem was Powhaten's singing voice (he was so much better as Rasputin's in Anastasia)... but you can't win them all, I suppose.
I used to hate the talking tree, now I don't mind her.  The animals are used in quite an interesting manner; almost as an allegory for what happens between the Powhatens and the settlers.  Of course there is a lot of slapstick humor between them for the kiddies' amusement, but older people should be able to look past that.
Seriously, though, I don't see anyone complain about how Aladdin butchered the Muslim tale on which it was based.  Probably because it was so well-done.  Well, I believe that Pocahontas was so well-done that people need to get off of their high horse and just enjoy a beautifully-told story for once.",1063497600,,2836,4.516634050880627

7724689,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Brimming with lush animation and an Oscar-winning score, Pocahontas is an emotional tale of love, greed, communal hatred and sacrifice. Along the edge waters of Virginia, Pocahontas, the free-spirited daughter of Powhatan, watches as the mysterious shipload of settlers arrive led by the greedy governor Ratcliff and the courageous Captain John Smith. Along with her friends Meeko, a mischievous raccoon and Flit, a feisty hummingbird Pocahontas develops a strong friendship with John Smith which soon transforms into love. But when tension mounts between their two very different cultures, she must find a way to bring peace between the two communities.

The wonderful voice talent and Alan Menken's excellent music help in portraying the magic of this movie. Mel Gibson is exceptional as the speaking and singing voice of John Smith. Irene Bedard is good as Pocahontas and Linda Hunt is the perfect choice for the voice of Grandmother Willow. Christian Bale, Russell Means and David Ogden Stiers lend their respective talents as the voices of Thomas, Powhatan and Governor Ratcliff. The songs are very melodious and well-written (by Grammy winner Stephen Schwartz); the `Colors Of The Wind' being a true masterpiece (which won the Oscar for the best song in 1995).

Although historically inaccurate, the movie is unique in its visual style and in the message it conveys to us about love and sacrifice. The emotional depth is something I have never before witnessed in an animated feature. There are scenes which will truly touch your heart. I am a full grown adult, yet tears sting my eyes every time I watch the end. I think the true beauty of the movie lies in the ending.

  One more thing, the movie is certainly not for kids or for those who like fun-oriented animated stuff like `Toy Story' or `Shrek'. Although it does provide some humor and light moments, the plot is completely adult-oriented and revolves around communal harmony, which I do not think that kids will like very much. So if you are a real appreciator of emotional and artistic beauty and know the value of true love and sacrifice, go enjoy this movie. As for me, I think it is truly a timeless masterpiece.",1059523200,5,2182,4.967123287671233

Let's watch it! Then she said, We both remember the first one. I think we have the second one somewhere, let's watch that! So, we popped it in, and stared in dismay as it got worse...and worse...and worse. The history, for one, destroyed it, since I tend to like accurate things. Then, Smith comes in and the other guy(Rolf?) is heartbroken. Mmm hmmm. And Pocahontas saves Smith in the first one, and chooses Rolf in the second, and Smith WALKS AWAY like nothing happened?

I enjoyed ""Pocahontas"" and I would recommend the movie to anyone who's in for a good hour and a half of fun.

Yeah, it's Disney.  Yeah, it's something in front of which brain-dead yuppies are supposed to be able to seat their larvae so as to keep the little weasels from messing with daddy's Sharper Image catalog while mommie goes through her aerobics routine, trying to wipe out those stretch marks.  Yeah, it's yet another one of those Great Amurrican Myths that we're all supposed to internalize, about the beautiful Injun princess and the handsome young English soldier.  Yeah.
Of course, the image doesn't get maintained once you take the kids on that week-end trip to the Jamestown historic site and they discover that the Tidewater stomping grounds of the Powhatan Confederacy consists of flat alluvial plains with no cliffs or picturesque waterfalls off which to make impressive dives, that Pocahontas was only the young lady's nickname (meaning ""playful"" or ""little wanton"" in Algonquinian), and that no matter what's just around the river bend, you wind up in the Chesapeake Bay.
You'll find that it grits in your wife's craw as you explain to your grandkids that when John Smith and Pocahontas met in 1607, he was about 27 and she was perhaps 10 or 12 years old, that they were friends but never fell in love with one another, and that her role in ""saving"" John Smith's life was part of a ritual of mock execution-and-rescue traditional among Algonquin tribes at the time.  Big romance, right?  Yeah.
""All this stuff in the movie is made-up Disney mush,"" you explain.  ""The English came here expecting to set up farms and develop a self-sustaining colony after an earlier attempt at Roanoke had failed because of a horrible drought.

If you read the biography of Pocahontas, you can find out the truths and untruths behind this Disney movie. The fact is, knowing Disney was going to do this movie should have let people know that it would be sugar coated and somewhat stereotypical. Explaining to a young child why a 40 year old would even be attracted to a 12 year old would be difficult. The basis of the story: John Smith and company arriving in Virginia in 1607 to find gold and then meeting with the Powhatan tribe, is there. Children can learn the disturbing treatment the Native Americans recieved later on in junior high and high school.  Disney does however let children know the value of talking out differences and seeing beyond color and outward differences to find what life and love are truly about. Not to be completely cliche, but, if nothing else, this movie does show children that it's what's inside that counts.

The point is, you shouldn't be completely focused on what's ""politically correct"" or not. The animation is the most interesting animation Disney has done (Eat your heart out, Tarzan!!) and the music is one word: SPECTACULAR!  ""Colors of the Wind"" definatly deserved a Grammy.  Anyways, this story depicts (not historically accurate of course) the tale of Brittish settlers first coming to soon-to-be Jamestown in 1607. The opening is just fantastic and really gets you excited. I can't help but watching this movie again again...I saw it 3 times in theatres!!  It has your typical cooky and crazy disney characters (Cute & playful Meeko the Racoon and Pursey the Pug, Mean and angry Captain Radcliffe & his funny and somewhat dumb assistant *the animals thankfully don't talk) and your typical disney love story (this time with Pocahontas and Brittish explorer John Smith *no relation to me, hehe*...and also portrayed by brillant actor Mel Gibson).  I really reccomend this to families who haven't seen it, for everyone will enjoy it. I saw it when I was in 6th grade so it's good for all age levels. And I'd be suprised if you don't get the soundtrack to it when you're finished seieng it, for the music will leave you singing along with it! Overall, Pochahontas is my favorite disney cartoon and definatly did not deserve a 3 1/2 Star rating...rather I think it deserves 5 1/2 and my grade for it is an A++.

7724701,5,B01DTNVGYI,"... since I'm one of those rare people who actually loved this movie, I'd absolutely give the DVD five stars.
As for the movie itself: a lot of people complain that it's very different from what sketchy historical information we have about Pocahontas herself, but if you really expect a Disney film to be a history lesson, then you've got a whole other set of problems that you should be dealing with.
The character animation, backgrounds, and coloring are all gorgeous.  The voices are excellent, and even if you don't like musical numbers as a rule (I sure don't) these are at least well-performed.  You certainly don't get the sense that they were written so that Disney could make a few extra bucks with a pop song.  The characters are wonderfully done; particularly the extras (Thomas and Nakoma in particular, as well as Kocoum, Ben, and Lon), who usually get the short end of the stick as far as development goes.  Not in this movie, though.  And while there *is* a talking tree, the requisite cute animal sidekicks don't talk, thank goodness.
As for the DVD: the transfer is good.  The extras are also fun to play with, even if there aren't many to choose from.  It's definitely worth spending the extra money to get the DVD version of this movie, rather than the VHS.
And for crying out loud, stop expecting ""Pocahontas"" to be like a documentary.  This film is no worse a bastardization of the real story than ""The Little Mermaid"" is of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale or ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" is of Hugo's novel.  Enjoy it for the well-animated, romantic movie that it is.",1021766400,3,1591,4.673835125448028

7724703,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Pochontas 2 is the continuing tale of what happens to Poca a few months(?) after the first one.  The time frame is a little hard to figure out.  The prologue takes place SOMETIME after the first movie ended, and then after the opening credits Pocahontas's friend tells her that ""much time has passed"" since the prologue.  It's never specific though.  The animation of this movie is not as breathtaking as the original, but considering the bulk of this film takes place in London and not the sweeping vistas of pre-industrial age America, that would make sense.
The songs are okay.  The first song in the film, ""Where Do I Go From Here"" is a wonderful song sung by Pocahontas.  It really rivals the original film's music.  The rest, however, I found a little off-putting upon first viewing, but subsequent viewing have shown that they aren't as bad as I thought they were (especially the ""white, white till he sees you"" song that John Rolfe's psychotic maid sings with her British accent providing a bit too much to the song).
Poca2's DVD is better in picture quality by leaps and bounds of the Poca1 DVD.  The story is also very interesting, not your typical Disney movie.  The ending is the only thing that floored me.  If you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it, but if you read the other reviews, you will be able to figure out what happens.
If you are a fan of Disney, or of Pocahontas 1 (to a lesser extent since the two movies are VERY different), then pick this disc up.  You shouldn't be disappointed.",1014681600,,1514,4.549815498154982

She is highly optimistic and can't wait to see what is around the river bend. Instead of taking the calm path in life, she actively seeks adventure.

Her father, Chief Powhata, believes it is time for her to take more responsibility and settle down. She faces an arranged marriage with a man she finds a bit too serious for her tastes. When she meets Captain John Smith, she feels she has finally found her soul mate.

Now, she just has to convince her father and to complicate matters, John Smith and Pocahontas are caught between a confrontation between the Native Americans and the English settlers.

Their love reaches beyond the feelings they have for one another and Pocahontas shows wisdom beyond her years when she helps to prevent hatred from taking the lives of her beloved people.

While this film is gravely incorrect as far as history goes, Disney has given us a new story that shows us what happened to Pocahontas and John Smith's relationship. Pocahontas' journey to England was a terrific idea, and from that the creators were able to mine endless possibilites. All the songs are catchy, and come close to matching those of the original (surpassing some). The ending might be disappointing to some, becuase it does an injustice to the original film.

I am not one who usually complains about such things. In fact, you won't hear me ranting and raving over the historical facts of the film. Let's face it, this is Disney and the story is written with children in mind. If anyone is going to take historical figures and turn them into a fairy tale, it is Disney. That is to be expected.

True, it is a sequel, but the animation here is no better than that which you would find in a Saturday morning cartoon.

7724714,3,B01DTNVGYI,"No Disney movie has ever been awaited with such anticipation as was Pocahontas. After the series of early '90's masterpieces--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King (which broke both box office and video records) everyone expected the trend to continue. I was wary before the fact that this one might be a letdown, and indeed it was. It didn't live up to the anticipation or the pre-release screening. The ""Colors of the Wind"" song was good enough to tantalize, but the rest of the score and songs are far from Alan Menken's best (seen in Mermaid and Beast).
Simply put, this movie was a disappointment after the Great Four. It isn't all bad by any means. I appreciate its good points, especially the fact that it didn't give us a predictable white=bad/all things Native American=good scenario and showed us the Indians' prejudices as well as those of the whites. That being said, however, the movie's heart-on-sleeve political correctness becomes very stifling indeed to the escapist joy we expect from even the most serious Disney animated stories. Aladdin proved that Disney animation can be both fun and appealing to adults at the same time. Pocahontas is seriously deficient in the fun factor.
It really was the beginning of the downturn in the latter half of the decade for Disney. None of the other films following it come close to the quality of the Great Four, even though ""Hunchback"" is undeniably powerful. Now, with the disturbing trend away from musicals seen in ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and ""Atlantis"" (which began as early as ""Tarzan""), it's hard to believe that Disney can catch the early '90's magic again. Unfortunately, Pocahontas is clearly the beginning of a decline.",999907200,,1720,4.955017301038063
7724715,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Walt Disney's ""Pocahontas"" could never be used in any classroom as a depiction of textbook history. But it is a tale of people learning to overcome their personal prejudices, and to enjoy the beauty of nature without always letting civilization take over. It offers the viewers a tale of adventure, greed, heartbreak, tradition, and sacrifice.
 What impresses me about the way many cartoon movie characters are drawn is the accuracy in capturing the features of the actors who give them their voices. Captain John Smith looks and moves like Mel Gibson (with the exception of the blond hair), with his classic features captured to perfection; Pocahontas looks like Irene Bedard, Powhatan like Russell Means, Grandmother Willow like Linda Hunt, Thomas like Christian Bale, etc.
  The musical score is intense, as is the final confrontation between the English and the Native Americans. Judy Kuhn's rendering of ""The Colors of the Wind"" is very uplifting . When I had a chance to view the edited version of ""If I Never Knew You"", I realized that Gibson's singing has potential; with a little training, he could handle the range of either Al Martino or Robert Goulet.-- I wouldn't write him off completely as a singer even though he does leave something to be desired there.
 David Ogden Stiers, is reprising his role on M.A.S.H. in a different medium as the snooty Radcliffe.
  The woodland cuties, Flit, and Meeko,and the bulldog, Percy continue the Disney tradition of giving the main characters a few animal sidekicks. The ending where a wounded John Smith literally beams at the site of the reconciliation among the animals is a delightful one.
  I would recommend this benevolent, politically correct tale to children of all ages. The younger ones can always deal with historical accuracy later.",999475200,,1797,5.047297297297297
7724716,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Sadly, people expect Pocahontas to be another Lion King, which it is not.  It's a much more quiet, serious, magical, more adult love story and of the recent Disney films, the one that touches me the most.  Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is terrible.
At least it's presented in widescreen, but on all other counts the DVD is sub-par.  The image is washed out, grainy and the colors seem to bleed a bit.  Plus the sound is a bit distant sounding at times.  I have the deluxe laserdic edition wich was a perfect transfer.  Why they didn't just use that for the DVD I'll never know.  There are a few extras included like the stroy book mode which lets you read or have the story read to you, 2 music videos, a short and simple trivia game and the obligatory trailer.
Reading through these reviews I don't understand why people expect this film to be historically accurate.  First of all this is Disney.  They even revise all their stories so they are more to their liking.  Secondly, it was said again and again in all of the offical information for Pocahontas that it was based on the LEGEND of Pocahontas.  Besides, it could never be historically accurate because historians themselves disagree on the actual events. Does all this mean that we should be deprived of experiencing a marvolous film that teaches compassion and the evils of bigotry?  I think not.
This film is Disney's first serious attempt at growing up and presenting deeper, more realistic emotions into it's films.  It was a courageous step taken in the most beautiful way.  The songs are wonderful and moving.  You're sure to be singing them long after the film has ended. My girpes with the film are it should have been longer, even more adult and the touching love song, If I Never Knew You should never have been cut.  But these quibbles are just that, taken as a whole, Pocahontas is an astonishing achievement for the new Disney, topped (posssibly) only by The Hunchback of Notre Dame.  Disney needs to grow to survive and this was an excellent frist step.  Do not let the naysayyers or the bad DVD transfer stop you from enjoying the greatest love story ever animated.

7724717,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Pocahontas is a good tale that deserves to have the Disney name. While far from the most entertaining in the Disney library, this one does have some of the most spectacular animation and imagery then any of them! The film is definatley not for the very young, there is much war violence (superficial, yes, but it's still there), including some blood-free shot wounds. The story is much more mature oriented, with Pocahontas trying to end the war between her people and the white-men for the sake of her love for John Smith.
The film has many songs, but only a few stand out - -Oscar Award Winner ""Colors Of The Wind"" is one of them,  ""Around the River Bend"", and ""If I Never Knew You"" is the other - -  the rest are catchy, but unmemorable numbers.
The ""Gold Classic Collection"" DVD edition of the 1995 film, has a mediocre picture. There is constant grain, and it is rarely perfectly clear. On the plus side, the animation is still able to be appreciated and the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is good.

7724718,5,B01DTNVGYI,"""Pocahontas"" was not exactly what I expected from Disney.  (For one thing, the princess doesn't wind up with the ""prince"" -- a little closer to Pocahontas' real life story).  That said ... the music, animation, and so on are all outstanding.  One of the real surprises in this film is Mel Gibson's talent as a voice actor and *singer* - he's extremely good.  Gibson describes himself as a ""shower-only singer,"" and I think that is a real misnomer.
Pocahontas has her amusing animal friends, Flit (the humming bird) and a truly humorous little raccoon whose name escapes me at the moment.  It is because of her friendship with these animals that she works so hard to convince John Smith (Gibson) of the importance of living in harmony with the land.
I think the film carries a couple of good messages, along with its high entertainment value.  The first is, of course, to live in harmony with the land.  The second is that ""savage"" is often defined by which side of the line you happen to stand on - people often see those who are different as ""wrong.""  ""Pocahontas"" goes a long way toward teaching young people the importance of shedding that viewpoint.",997401600,2,1153,4.673267326732673
7724719,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Audiences seem to be split concerning this movie, they hate it or love it. Personnally, I loved it much more than the original which I don't own. The animation is exceptional for straight-to-video release and the songs are as wonderful, if not more than those of the 1995 flick (I have a soft spot for ""Where Do I Go From Here""). This is also one of the first Disney movies I actually rented before buying it. This story, although still historically unaccurate (Pocahontas is supposed to die a few days after they go on the boat *There won't be another sequel*), is very cute and has hilarious moments. In my mind, it would have been a hit in theatres.
This movie is remarkable and well done compared to many Disney sequels. Let's go over them with my ratings:
The Return of Jafar: I hated it 0/5
Aladdin & The King of Thieves: Not too bad 3/5
102 Dalmatians: Same story as the remake, wasn't it enough!! 0/5
Little Mermaid II: Same story as the original except Melody (Ariel's daughter) wants to go the sea (Roles exchaged). 1/5
Lady And The Tramp II: Same story with Scamp (son of Lady & Tamp) agian with roles exchanged. Very poor animation! 0/5
Fantasia 2000: Lives up to the original although I didn't really like the pieces that were chosen, but for wonderful animation 4/5
The Rescuers Down Under: Good, I loved it when I was young. 3/5
Beauty & The Beast Xmas: Great holiday movie and wonderful songs 4/5
More Beauty & The Beast videos that weren't hits 0/5

Dumbo II
Cinderella II: Dreams Come True
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame II
101 Dalmations: The Animated Sequel (We have enough already!)

Why keep messing with our memories, anyway, we know now that Disney is just a company that's losing money and taking the most they can out of their classics by making sometimes-absurd sequels!

7724720,4,B01DTNVGYI,After the first film was left a little unfinished although moving me to tears I was desperate to know the future of pocahontas and whether or not it would be true to history. Now i know that all turns out well for my favourite disney heroine. At first I thought the conflict between the two Johns (smith and Rolfe) may ruin not only this film but any enjoyment of the original feature. Imagine then how delighted I was to find that John Smith was replaced with feeling compassion and with a character so easy to like in his short comings. Side characters such as meeko and the loveable tea lady mrs Jenkins added the comical relief and the good people at disney kept Pocahontas true to her disney roots even though the film was a little sugar coated to be historically accurate. The best disney sequel I've ever seen!! ***,997056000,,822,4.486666666666666
7724721,5,B01DTNVGYI,"To anyone expecting a historical and accurate presentation of envents, look elsewhere. But then why are you looking at Disney films in the first place? They are famous for sugar-coating fairy tales and myths, why should historical stories be any different?
That said, Pocahontas is a surprisingly real story even if it's events are complete fiction.  It's characters feel like real people, and the events are both tragic and inspiring, and, yes children, not all endings are happy.
What's wonderful about Disney is how they can make a heart-wrenching tale such as this and still include light moments that don't seem totally out of place.  The cute animal antics are great and show that animals don't need to talk to be funny. Such constant prescenses and Grandmother Willow and Wiggins add comic relief to what would normally be only serious situations.
The story is classic and teaches a good lesson. Who cares if it's historically accurate? Leave that for the history books to tell!  Disney's calling it historical merely indicates that it is BASED on history in the way that The Little Mermaid was BASED on a fairy tale. And I don't need to remind you that Ariel commited suicide in Anderson's original tale.
Anyhow, many people I know don't like this film cause it's too serious.  Most of the guys I hang around with need a good fight scene or perhaps an explosion before they'll acknowledge a film's greatness. Also the humor is a lot more subtle in Pocahontas than in many Disney films.  Others like the film but not the ending.
To me, Pocahontas is a masterpiece of artistic creativity. Sure it's historical balderdash, but it's a great story, has great characters, and has more depth than many live-action films today. While it is not my favorite of the recent Disney movies, it's a great one, and I love to see them trying different things!",994377600,3,1850,4.823343848580442
7724722,5,B01DTNVGYI,"It is a pity that this film didn't quite get the critical acclaim it deserved, as it is truly a classic.  A reason for its lack of popularity may be the fact that it is something of a divergence from the normal Disney formula.  Yes, it has the fatherless heroine, the cute animal familiars and the ugly villain (with the requisite baritone voice) but the glaring inconsistency is that Disney chose to have Pocahontas stay at home while John Smith returned to England, when in reality she went with him (she is buried in Westminster Abbey).  I believe that this is the main reason that some people didn't like the film, however, these people conveniently chose to overlook the stirring score (especially ""Just Around the Riverbend""), the heartrending dialogue and of course, the extremely pertinent social message.

That is the setting for ""POCAHONTAS II.""
This is an excellent sequel. I never thought I would be saying that about a direct-to-video movie. I was wrong and ""POCAHONTAS II"" is a strong testament to that.
The film is very faithful to the original characters all around. With the introduction of John Rolfe the story follows the historic Pocahontas as she crosses the Atlantic as the Indian Princess and emissary of her people to London to be received at court and be lionized by English society.
Eventually she confronts Governor Ratcliffe and the real drama begins. Ratcliffe is much more a villain in this film than he was in the original ""POCAHONTAS."" To give any more details would be inappropriate. There are many surprises along the way, but Meeko, Flit and Percy are featured throughout so it makes this excellent family fare. There are also at least five knew songs that I was able to count. They were very good and fit each scene perfectly.
I was really impressed by the artwork on this feature. This time we get to see the North American virgin land of towering forests covered with Winter's snow, frozen waterfalls and white covered cliffs drawn again with a freedom and energy that posses real power and reverence for the land. In contrast we get to see London congested with buildings and people, horses and carriages crowded in cobble stone streets. Most important to any film, it has a good story, which combines the settings and narrative perfectly.
The DVD widescreen picture quality and stereo sound is excellent. I highly recommend this feature. It went far beyond my expectations.",971913600,6,1853,4.848580441640379
7724728,5,B01DTNVGYI,"Meeko, Flit and Percy, these the are names of the animal friends who get in and out of mischief, befriend each other and accompany Pocahontas in the vast panorama of pristine North America that is the setting for ""POCAHONTAS."" No Disney animated film would be complete without these familiar looking creatures and rightly so. These are films for the whole family, but ""POCAHONTAS"" was a notch above many of the animated films from Disney over the past two decades.
""POCAHONTAS"" was a change-of-pace from the recent trend of animated films from Disney in 1995. This is one of my favorite Disney films and one of the best since the 1960s. It has substance and deals with real issues. We see the Native American Indians at peace and harmony with the land and nature. This is beautifully captured with the exceptional animation of vibrant green forests and flowing blue rivers. These scenes have a breath of fresh air about them that you can almost feel. When the European settlers arrive we know that it is only a matter of time before they begin to erode this paradise. The Europeans with closed minds did not realize how much they had to learn from the Indians and tried to impose their brand of civilization on them.  Their brand of civilization is to subjugate or annihilate the ""savages"" and ravage the land.
We see the two cultures meet in one of the finest animated scenes ever presented by Disney. Captain John Smith and Pocahontas come face to face by a waterfall. Smith lowers his rifle, as Pocahontas stands erect and unafraid. Their eyes meet and he no longer sees a ""savage"" but a human being. Their eyes tell us that they immediately fall in love. As Pocahontas  ""listens with her heart"" as Grandmother Willow has taught her they both communicate with each other. Soon their differences become apparent, but it is John Smith's ignorance revealed by inadvertently referring to Pocahontas as a ""savage"" that is the focus of the rift. He states that there is so much the ""savages"" can learn from the English. Pocahontas asks, ""If the savage one is me, how can there be so much that you don't know?"" During the ""Colors of the Wind"" sequence John Smith learns first hand the value and reverence of nature and that it should not be exploited out of mere human greed.
The message of ""POCAHONTAS"" is that European settlers leveled forests and imposed their own vision of a ""civilized"" society, whether or not it was welcome by the Native Americans. The corrupt Governor Ratcliffe is shown gleefully using cannons to level forests while his other men wield picks and axes in a mocking musical number. The brown piles of shoveled up earth stand in contrast to the majesty of the green untouched forest. When the settlers open fire on the Indians, they retaliate by capturing John Smith and prepare an execution for him. Only Pocahontas, who can empathize with both sides, can bring them to see their transgressions and teach them that violence only breeds violence.
The dramatic structure over which the film's message is delivered deals with her father's disapproval of the man she loves, because he belongs to a different race.  The film thus takes on more significance as it deals with ethnic discriminations as well. Her father wants her to marry a member of the tribe, who she dislikes because ""he's so serious."" A similar theme is taken up in ""THE LITTLE MERMAID.""
""POCAHONTAS"" is based on legend, rooted in murky historical events. In real life, Pocahontas was about 13 when she first met John Smith. Smith claimed in his journals that Pocahontas saved his life. John Rolfe was the Englishman that she eventually married. She did indeed get to go to England (See ""POCAHONTAS II""), where she was treated as a princess. She died in Europe, near 21 years of age.
What is particularly good about ""POCAHONTAS"" is the artistry of the animation. The virgin land of towering green forests, sparkling blue steams and rugged cliffs are drawn with a freedom and energy that posses real power and reverence. Very effective is the jutting rock that overlooks the landscape giving the entire film a feeling of sweep and grandeur. Anyone viewing the finale of this film can not help feel an emotional outburst as the ""colors of the wind"" blow past this precipice toward the horizon.  I know I did. The image is unforgettable.
The songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz include one unrestrained emotionally charged standout, ""Colors of the Wind."" This is an unforgettable song that can be appreciated on so many levels. It is a consummate example of melody and lyrics that make you ""Listen With Your Heart.""",971222400,14,4602,4.806818181818182

7724731,1,B01DTNVGYI,"When I first heard that Disney was making a sequel to ""Pocahontas"", I wondered if they would do it jusice, or butcher  it. Obviously, they got themselves in quite a predicament here. They  couldn't be true to the original without murdering history and they  couldn't be true to history (what gave them the urge to suddenly be loyal  to history, anyway?) without murdering the original. The brilliant  solution: murder both! Okay, let me put in more detail. First of all, they  took John Smith, who was my favorite of Disney's male heros, and not only  drained his brain, but drained his heart. He doesn't even care when he  finds out that Pocahontas fell for John Rolfe! Honestly!  And what's the  big idea of making Pocahontas fall for him anyway!  The Rolfe guy is a  total jerk,and suddenly Pocahontas loves him! They didn't want us to like  John Smith anymore, that's what it is! They didn't want us to say  ""Come on, Pocahontas, you know who you really love!"" No, they  wanted us to say ""You go, girl! Dump him! Dump him!"" So the movie  rushes by without any real emotion, plenty of scenes where a wisecracking,  swashbuckling John Smith uses his sword to show off, and a lame mix of fact  and fancy. Forget history, Pocahontas and John Smith seem like the LAST  Disney couple that would ""divorce""!  I refuse to believe that  this guy is the same John Smith that was in the original! It simply can't  be!  You remember ""Colors of the Wind"" from the original? That  was one of the most moving transformations that Disney ever cranked up! So  how was Pocahontas's influence on him only temporary!  The only logical  explanations would be that John Smith was posessed by an evil spirt, or  hypnotized between movies, or this is his evil twin! Although John Smith is  the most notable butchering of the original, it's not the only thing they  did to it. The animation is terrible, the songs are only so-so, and, with  all due respect to Native Americans, Pocahontas acts like a jerk. In the  final battle, she just sits around under Ratcliffe's sword, waiting to be  rescued by John Smith. Honestly!  I'm not a picky feminest, but that's  ridiculous! Also, so many things are left hanging, such as why does  Ratcliffe have such a strong influence on the  king when he came home in  chains? In short, this movie is murder. You can feel that Disney is walking  through the film on tiptoe, not wanting to upset anyone. Well they upset  me! Badly done, Disney!",966556800,45,2457,4.623255813953488

Historically, there is  nothing to be said that hasn't already been said about an original, suffice  to say that it's a fictional work based loosely on some historical  characters.
The greatest disappointment though is, in my own opinion,  the lack of that creative spark that lifts the feature from being  entertainment for children (which it certainly is) to being well rounded  family entertainment.  The plot is simple and well developed but  nevertheless predictable and weighed down more than it need be by unsubtle  political correctness and morality lessons that hinder the story's pace.

That feature always caught me.
Anyway, you either  like the animation or you don't.  The audio is very well done.  No major  sound effects but the music and the dialogue is the main things for this  film.  What about the video?  The video is a shock.  Where Tarzan bursts  with a radiance of colors, not Pocahontas.  What happened during the  transfer?  It's like a transfer from a video tape seen 10 times before.  Not acceptable with a DVD!  I can't believe the colors aren't superb.
Extras...well, I guess after the fans were upset that Disney didn't  include any extras in their previous releases, now they are with their  ""Gold Collections"".  I like how the DVD has the two music videos  especially ""Colors of the Wind"" by Vanessa Williams.  There are a  lot of trailers before the movies which you can fortunately skip over, a  trivia game and DVD storybook like the Tarzan DVD and a fun with nature  booklet which they should of added to the DVD.  Otherwise it's better than  what we got before from older Disney DVD's.  So, we have the movie at above  average, the special features in the C to C- range and the DVD Overall  probably a B-/C+.
Otherwise, for a DVD from Disney, this movie deserved  better.  A better video transfer and they could at least added the making  of Pocahontas or something.  (sigh)...

There have been  numerous jabs at the lack of the historical believability of this film --  rightly deserved for the most part -- but, when one watches Disney they  have to realize that sometimes that kind of accuracy takes a back seat to  story telling.  Disney provides its own historiography (writing of history,  that is).
The reason I rated this show at three stars has little to do  with the issue of historical accuracy, rather, I think that the villain you  love to hate (a la Cruella) never shows up.  Oh, sure, the governor is a  greedy rascal, but, I hated his dog more than I disliked him!  At the same  time, the heroine/hero combo was somewhat lackluster.  In addition, the  story didn't seem to really get going before it ended.
There was some  promise of development, though, with the Grandmother Willow character and  with the tribe member who wanted to marry Pocohontas.  I also liked Miko  and Flick -- my favorite characters in the show.
The strongest part of  this show was an environmental message, which encourages us to live with  nature, not in opposition to it.

Also the pop song If I Never Knew  You blew me away.  And two, the underlying soundtrack perfomed by Alan  Menken.  The music was absolutly riviting, as it has to be to convey the  serious emotions Disney was going for.  A bit depressing in it honesty of  hate and love, this movie shows that animated movies can convey more  emotions than just laughter.",961113600,11,758,4.621212121212121
7724746,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Coming after the four-film punch of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" and ""The Lion King,"" Disney had a tough act to follow: itself. As a result, many  critics were overly condemning of ""Pocahontas,"" dismissing it as  having lackluster music, altered historical facts, and less-than-stellar  animation.
Sorry, guys, but Disney scored.  The songs are quite memorable  and delivered well by non-singers Mel Gibson and David Ogden Stiers.  Both  actors do a credible job with their respective solo efforts.
Yes, there  were some liberties taken with the depiction of such a curvaceous and  liberated Pocahontas and the ready-for-the-beach Captain John Smith, but  this is just entertainment.  Remember ""Titanic"" featured  ficticious lovers, too, and we all know how much it grossed.
The conflict  between Native Americans and the invading ""colonists"" is glossed  over somewhat but is still presented in such a way to cause little minds -  with adult supervision - to ponder what really occured in Colonial  America.
Not a perfect film but deserving repeat viewing an ownership.",960768000,6,1097,5.402366863905326
7724747,1,B01DTNVGYI,"I was so disappointed in this movie.  And it has nothing to do with the ""historical accuracy"" of the movie...what really bothered me was the way Pocohontas and her man apparently learned to speak each others'  languages in about 5 seconds.  I know they've got to condense that part of  the story, but this is ridiculous!",960508800,11,320,4.660714285714286
7724748,3,B01DTNVGYI,"I don't think the problem with this film is the look (it is very competently made) or the music (decent Broadway stuff, if not exceptional) or even the historical accuracy (which no one should expect from Disney, or  even from Hollywood in general). It's the very aggressiveness of the film's  political correctness, which is so bold (to the point of self parody) that  it starts to swamp the good time that one expects to have watching a big  Disney summer cartoon. I mean, how many times do we have to absorb  ""Indians good, Europeans bad"" in one film? How much of the whites  grubbing for gold? How much of the noble, upraised profiles of the Indians?  Even the appearance of a pug as a main character (OK, that was a cheap one  - I own 3 of the critters) doesn't help. Even the pug is a little creep at  first! Must be from hanging around all those Europeans.... If you want  vintage latter day Disney, stick with ""Little Mermaid"" and  ""Beauty and the Beast"".",960336000,4,963,4.477011494252873
7724749,1,B01DTNVGYI,"I have most of Disney's Animation collection and look foward to the re-releases. Pocahontas on DVD is a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie.  However the DVD version is NOT good.  It is a bad  transfer. The DVD version is grainy and the colors bleed. At this poor  level of transfer, I would stick with the VHS version and wait for a better  transfer version to come out.",960249600,13,392,4.388888888888889
7724750,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Though this Disney musical does not have the pure fantasy and magic of their true classic films (Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, etc.), it is a beautiful and easy-to-swallow history lesson all the same.  The history, while embellished and changed to contain a love story and a  few forest creatures with sparkling personalities, paints a noble picture  of Native Americans, and is sure to engender conversation in your family.  As pure entertainment, the old Disney touches are here in spades, from the  omnipresent swirling flurries of colored leaves, to the gliding, hypnotic  romps through the rivers and forest, to the melody-soaked score, which  includes the hit Colors of The Wind and the equally lovely Just Around The  Riverbend.  Disney's Pocahontas is a true babe; an independent spirit and a  good foible for the bad guys, who of course show up sooner rather than  later.",960163200,,900,5.054421768707483

7724752,4,B01DTNVGYI,"Every animated Disney movie takes a stong moral theme and bangs it into with a hammer.  In this movie there are a few themes for kids to grow up on.  Racism is bad.  That's a major one, it's hard not to see that in this  movie.  Other themes include overcomming obsticles and ""cant we all  just live toghether in peace!""  The animation is good, but the music  is hardly memerable and even though the story is good, it is GROSLY  different from the true story (changed to make it rated G)
Bottom line,  if you collect disney animation or you have kids, this belongs in your  library.  But it's not a movie young boys (or older) will enjoy too much.",959472000,,647,4.3

7724756,4,B01DTNVGYI,"With beautiful animation, rich colors and much attention to detail (ranging from the backgrounds to the people--even the crew of John Smith's  ship have authentic Irish, Scotch, and British accents), and a fantastic  sound track, ""Pocahontas"" is certainly worthy of being included  in your family's home video collection.  There is much less violence than  you find in some recent Disney animated films, bloodshed is not blatant and  gory, and the people are just so darned attractive!  My three-year-old son  describes Pocahontas as ""prettier than a Barbie"", and she is,  indeed.  This work of historical fiction may stray a bit from the actual  facts, but is, overall, a worthy rendition of the tale of the famous Indian  ""princess"".",954288000,3,735,5.188034188034188
7724757,2,B01DTNVGYI,"I was so disappointed in this film. The animation is lovely, as always, but the ending was disappointing and the music was definitely mediocre. If you're gonna make an entirely fictitious film about a real life historical  character, would it hurt to have a happy ending? Instead, John Smith goes  back to England alone. What a bummer.

7724758,5,B01DTNVGYI,"i believe this cartoon to be much more in depth to real-life circumstances than other ones (ie., the little mermaid, etc.). it is very deep where racial tensions are exemplified and the conclusion of the story is no less  than dramatic and beautiful! the music in the story is also more than  wonderful to the ears and mind. this movie is one of the only cartoons an  ADULT can relate to.",951609600,5,388,4.436619718309859
7724759,5,B01DTNVGYI,"I don't understand why people expect this film to be historically accurate.  It was said again and again in all of the offical releases about it that it was based on the LEGEND of Pocahontas.  Besides, it could never  be historically accurate because historians disagree on the actual events.  Does all this mean that we should be deprived of experiencing a marvolous  film based on those events?  I think not.  This film is Disney's first  serious attempt at growing up and presenting deeper, more realistic  emotions into it's films.  It was a courageous step taken in the most  beautiful way.  The songs are wonderful, moving and you're sure to be  singing them long after the film has ended.  My girpes with the film are it  should have been longer, even more adult and If I Never Knew You should  never have been cut.  But these quibbles are just that, taken as what it is  Pocahontas is an astonishing achievement, topped (posssibly) only by The  Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to grow to survive and this was an  excellent frist step.  Do not let the naysayyers stop you from enjoying the  greatest love story ever animated.
