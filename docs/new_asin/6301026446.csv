7809382,5,6301026446,"Clever!  All through the pic, little twists; near the end, the leads are the ones who get surprised.  Quirky characters are throughout, and Michael Parks holds the picture together.  It never went to the theaters, but in the summer of 1987, it played on HBO and TMC with a 3 of 4 stars rating.  It's not a big picture, but worth watching.  The opening should hook you!",1328140800,2,368,4.432835820895522
