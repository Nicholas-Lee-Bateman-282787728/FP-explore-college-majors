5374202,5,B009ZIP9P4,"Jeff Novick takes you on a shopping tour of a supermarket, aisle by aisle. Using some simple nutritional guidelines, he shows you how to read nutritional labels and select healthy foods. Do you know that olive oil contains 14% saturated fat? I didn't. I also didn't know how easy it is to make a healthy, low fat, low sodium pasta sauce. That insight will pay for the course many times over. These are but two examples of the astonishing amount of information contained in the course. This is an excellent product, summarizing a lifetime of effort on Jeff's part. Highest rating.",1353888000,30,579,4.742574257425742
5374203,5,B009ZIP9P4,"I've been reading labels for awhile but having watched Jeff Novick's Shopping School, I am reminded that the nutrition facts are only one part of the information I need to read from the label.  The ingredients are just as important - maybe more important.  Jeff Novick show us how to really read the label - not just the front of the package which the manufacturers want us to do.  If you look at all of the cereals on the store shelves, you'd think that you could just pick up any box and be eating healthy.  Frankly, there are only a few that are truly healthy.  Look at all those grams of sugar, fat and added salt - no one needs that stuff!

You may find yourself taking notes and even watching it a second or third time.  The information Jeff Novick shares on the DVD is that important.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to shop for the best products available for healthier eating.",1377129600,3,895,4.349397590361446
5374204,5,B009ZIP9P4,"Excellent and informative video, alot of products are only available in the USA, but I have found many alternatives within Canada. Highly recomended.",1372809600,2,149,5.521739130434782
5374205,4,B009ZIP9P4,"Do you know to read labels and select the healthiest item on the shelf? If not, then this a great primer. Jeff Novick goes through reading the labels from the claims on the front of the package to the ingredients list to the nutritional value label.

This is focused on a whole food plant based diet so don't expect any guidance in the meat or dairy section except to walk by.",1369785600,2,376,4.295774647887324
5374206,3,B009ZIP9P4,"I got tired watching the first several minutes.  It may have been that I learned a lot from his previous videos about how and what to look for.  In all honesty, I will have to give this one a second chance.  Good information - moves a little slow.",1367193600,2,247,4.104166666666667
5374207,2,B009ZIP9P4,"I was disappointed with this DVD.  It is too bad that Whole Foods was used to demonstrate food choices.  We do not have a Whole Foods anywhere that we can get to.  The information is really basic and ""Forks over Knives"" or"" Engine 2 Kitchen Rescue"" are far better DVDs for shopping and food information.  I did appreciate the salt content information that was presented.  I have been a McDougall vegan for 30+ years and read the China Study a couple of years ago.  I found the DVD slow and tedious and not very informative.",1366502400,4,523,4.4526315789473685
5374208,4,B009ZIP9P4,"Jeff Novick gives a lot of practical advice for plant strong shopping. Five Stars for content. Unfortunately, the camera work is not the same quality as the nutrition information.

5374210,5,B009ZIP9P4,"It really is like being in a classroom and learning about how to properly shop for food.

8545680,5,B009ZIP9P4,"I found the information Mr. Novick provided VERY helpful.  I am new to the whole foods plant based way of eating and never really had anyone explain food labels to me before.  I went through our pantry with new eyes and tweaked it based on his recommendations.  My only complaint is that, like Vicki Spradling, my disc has no pdf files.
