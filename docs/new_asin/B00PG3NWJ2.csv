6798232,5,B00PG3NWJ2,"Just like I wanted Jeb Bartlett, CJ Craig, Sam Seaborn and all the rest of the West Wing cast to be real people, I am in love with the people of ACN! Aaron Sorkin is a voice desperately needed. The Newsroom is, hands down, the best thing I have ever seen. Cannot wait to see what Sorkin has in store for us next.",1418774400,140,312,3.9682539682539684
6798233,5,B00PG3NWJ2,"Aaron Sorkin's THE NEWSROOM is probably the most intelligent made for television series ever made. Though only six episodes long (and sadly the last of the series) the season has maintained it's challenging power throughout. This is truly an ensemble work with a cast of actors as fine as anyone has assembled. The season finale demonstrated what a genius Aaron Sorkin is. In the nexy to last episode the head of the station Charlie Skinner (Sam Waterston) dies of a heart attack. The last show takes place at his funeral and burial, but instead of being morose at the loss of a man everyone loved, Sorkin used this episode to explore the impact Charlie had on each of the people with whom he worked an dhow his motto of reporting the new with decency and truth was the main theme. This allowed us to revisit the romances of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels at hi best) and MacKenzie Harper (Emily Mortimer) - they are pregnant - , Jim Harper (John Gallagher Jr.) and Maggie Jordan (Allison Pill), and Don Keefer (Thomas Sadoski) and Sloan Sabbith (Olivia Munn) as well as allowing the return of Neal Sampat (De Patel) to the fold. Jane Fonda shines as Leona Lansing getting the new owner of the station Lucas Pruitt (BJ Novak) to see things her way. All of the initial season's threads are resolved or history shared.

This is a show that will be deeply missed. Aaron Sorkin is one of our finest writers: let's hope he has another series on his mind. Grady Harp, December",1418601600,20,1465,4.591603053435114
6798234,5,B00PG3NWJ2,"It's sad that such a brilliant show has come to an early end. That said, it was a fantastic end. I'm glad Aaron Sorkin & Co returned for one more set of 6 episodes to tie the story up.

***light spoilers regarding my opinion on the final season's direction, but no specific details.

The finale was absolutely beautiful, and re-framed the show in a way that I hadn't really considered, but also made it's truncated run seem like an intentional self-contained short story with an intentional beginning and end from the word go. The characters accomplished what they set out to do, found what they were looking for through each other, and no longer wonder if they're doing the right thing. They're now certain, and the show must go on.

I'd love to see more episodes, but after last nights finale (I'm writing this the day after the finale aired on HBO), I'm much more accepting that this is it. At least this show is ridiculously re-watchable. I've watched the first two seasons three times now, and I still look forward to another viewing. It goes pretty quickly, considering the entire series is only 25 episodes!",1418601600,81,1114,4.673469387755102

6798292,5,B00PG3NWJ2,"'Newsroom' season 3 has found it's legs, just when it us time to say so long. This series takes place in Atlantis Cable News and Jeff Daniels plays Will McAvoy. It is said his character is a take off of Keith Olbermann, late of MSNBC, though everyone denies it. Gruff exterior with a brilliant mind. He is taken off guard when his producer moves to a new show and takes his staff with him.

Emily Mortimer, plays MacKenzie, an old love and now his new executive producer. Mortimer is the one thing wrong with this show. I don't see the chemistry between she and Will. John Gallagher, Jr., plays James ""Jim"" Harper, a producer who was offered another job when MacKenzie's previous show was canceled but turned it down to follow her. Alison Pill, plays Margaret ""Maggie"" Jordan: an eager associate producer of News Night. She has complicated personal relationships, and she has just come back from Africa and a very difficult situation, and beefs to prove herself. Alison is a true spirit and great actress. Dev Patel plays Neelamani ""Neal"" Sampat, the writer of Will's blog and news scanner of the Internet. He becomes an ncreasingly mportant member of the team. Olivia Munn plays, Sloan Sabbith. She is an economist with a show on the network, and is easily the best of the group. Sam Waterston plays Charlie Skinner, the ACN news division president, and always upset or solving dilemmas. Jane Fonda has a bit part as the owner of the network.

Within the third year, we start out with the Boston Marathon Explosion and terrorists attacks. Neal receives a secret call giving him confidential info from the DOD. This proves to be a difficult situation which may leave Neal in jeopardy. The newsroom is in danger of being taken over, and all of the administration are working to make sure it does not occur. Mac and Will are planning their wedding, and putting out fires here and there. Not much is as it seems. Too many hands in the fire, but an e celkent send off. Enjoyed this year.

6798298,5,B00PG3NWJ2,"From it's first episode when ACN news anchor Will McAvoy, (Daniels), a Republican newscaster, rips apart the question posed by a broadcast student at Northwestern University, you know this might get good. Now, it's 2017 and I've watched this series, and introduced others to it, several times.
I'm very proud of the two degrees I hold, mass comm, and my MBA in finance. As a former broadcaster, (radio), I identified with the main characters need to be ""liked"". In the broadcast world you're only as good as your last ratings book, hence many viewers may find this show too ""highbrow"" for their tastes. If this is the case, please feel free to continue to keep up with the Kardashians and go on with your life.
If however, you'd like to see behind the scenes of what it takes to ""do"" the news, make sure to watch, at least the first episode, of this fantastic show. And remember, these people do this daily. To be civil in an uncivilized world is difficult, at best, and downright impossible sometimes.

**SPOILER**
I remember the Republican debate in 2011 when we had people booing an American soldier for being gay and him, the soldier, being worried that he wouldn't be allowed to fight for our freedom. I remember screaming at my TV that none of the candidates were actual statesmen, and NONE were qualified to be president because they wouldn't speak up against such reprehensible behavior. I was ashamed to be a Republican in 2012 because of that. And I thought then, ""Look how many candidates are on that stage, multiply by 10 million each. And that's how many votes Obama will win by"". l was a little short. In 2008 when the elderly lady called Obama a Muslim terrorist at a town hall meeting, John McCain spoke up and defended his opponent. He acted like a statesman should. We all must vote as our conscience tells us. But we don't have to be the playground bully,, Mr. Trump. Yes, I said it, chase me down and hate me forever, but as I said, conscience first.
Now here it is 2017 and once again the extreme right are acting like idiots. Of course, the Democrats aren't any better, but I haven't seen them boo a soldier fighting for them, for any reason, including the ones that would be worthy of such an offense.
I like that Daniels plays the everyman part. ""I'm a Republican, that means I support being able to defend ourselves, a smaller government, and fiscal responsibility. But by being identified as a Republican, it also means that I have to be a homophobic, gun toting, bible thumping, racist."" Most Republicans have some common sense, as do most Democrats. Then there's the crazies. Then, there's Don Quixote.",1490054400,9,2630,4.655913978494624

To my surprise, it presented a program that made me think, 'Hey, maybe that's what goes on at the news station I watch everyday.'  It incorporated the events of the staff's lives, and more importantly, it taught me a few things I didn't know.
I think I actually learned something during the times they discussed finances. Not to say it was a show based on educating views, but it was the type of show you couldn't help but learn from.
And yes, the last show was heartbreaking, and funny at the same time.
Originally when I decided to watch Newsroom, it was because I wanted something playing in the background while I cleaned the house. Needless to say, I found myself glued to my Kindle.

6798314,3,B00PG3NWJ2,"Seasons 1 and 3 were good. Season 2 was pretentious and annoying. Good characters. I would prefer more of a look into the news business and less of the silly romance stuff. Kinda cheesy. Basically, I enjoyed this and would have liked a Season 4 but overall I was hoping it would be more like The West Wing.",1486771200,2,306,4.293103448275862

6798316,4,B00PG3NWJ2,This third and final season of The Newsroom is shorter than the first two seasons.  It covers some strong topics and ends with a roller coaster of emotions.,1486684800,,156,4.571428571428571

6798323,5,B00PG3NWJ2,"Short and sweet, the third season still forgets the formula that made season one great, but somehow keeps an even keel as we deal with the entire world of our ensemble cast changing under their feet. A fine and bitter-sweet send-off to a fine series that could have been so much more, if only given the chance.",1486598400,,310,4.456140350877193
