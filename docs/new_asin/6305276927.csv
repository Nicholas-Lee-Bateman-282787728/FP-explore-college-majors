1003819,5,6305276927,"I still remember sitting around the TV excited when I sat down to watch my first live Wrestlemania. I was waiting to see Demolition get a rematch against Bobby Heenan's Collosal Connection. In my mind, there was no way that they could defeat the massive Andre who seemed to be squashing them at every event since they lost the belts. I still had faith in them though. Much to my excitement, they did just that.
This Wrestlemania had its share of other great moments to as Roddy Piper faced Bad News Brown, Jake Roberts took on Ted Dibiase for the Million $ belt, one of my other new favorites, Big Bossman faced Akeem, and most importantly, two of the WWF's biggest stars ever challenged each other in a match where both belts would be on the line.
I got to see Andre turn against Heenan, the return of Miss Elizabeth, and so many other big surprises in what I consider to be the all-time best Wrestlemania.",1062201600,,907,4.469879518072289
1003820,5,6305276927,"In 1990 the WWF was attempting to make the Ultimate Warrior the next Hulk Hogan.  Warrior had been mega pushed since he joined the company in 1987 and had already held the Intercontinental strap twice.  Going into this match, The Warrior was still holding the Intercontinental title and he was going to face the WWF Champion Hulk Hogan.  The WWF was making a big risk having Hogan job to The Ultimate Warrior but they felt it would all work out fine.  The truth is Warrior's world title reign was quite the disappointment and after ten months fans had had enough.  Warrior dropped the title and a few months later the belt was once again around Hogan's waist.  Although his reign was a downer the Toronto Skydome Wrestlemania VI event that commenced Warrior's lousy title reign is actually one of the best Wrestlemanias ever.
Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware- Not a great opener at all.  Martel was going under a decent heel push and Koko well he never won a big match ever so this should have ended before the bell rang. *
(Tag Championship) Colossal Connection (Champs) vs. Demolition-  The Demos are insanely over here and anything with Andre has always caught fans eyes.  Unfortunately Andre is in no condition to wrestle here and so his tag partner Haku takes on most the action.  This match could have been great but it seems awfully rushed.  It;s still decent and tyhe fans are extremely pully for Demolition and they of course did not disappoint. **1/2
Hercules vs. Earthquake- Earthquake is the WWF's newest unstoppable monster.  Hercules is a mildly successful baby face mid carder.  Earthquake crushes Herc.  'Nuff said. *
Brutus Beefcake vs. Mr. Perfect- Perfect is coming off his first loss (to the Warrior) here and Brutus is right in line for an Intercontinental shot.  Personally I felt Perfect needed the win here but whatever.  Bruti takes it.  Decent match. **
Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown- Brawl that ends in a count out.  Pretty pointless. *
Hart Foundation vs. Bolsheviks- The Harts are long overdue for a tag title shot here and prove a point when they squash the Russians in 19 seconds. *
Barbarian vs. Tito Santana- The Powers Of Pain had recently broke up and Barbarian (as well as the Warlord) was being pushed solo.  Tito is the one who has to job in order to put him over as a heel threat. **
Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire vs. Macho King and Sherri- Awful mixed tag.  To think Savage was once WWF champ here and Sherri and Sapphire gonig at it is just downright brutal. *
The Orient Express vs. The Rockers- Both good teams but another rushed match that ends with Marty Jannetty taking a count out after Sato throws salt in his eyes.  This could have been better. **1/2
Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo- Hacksaw wins it but it's Duggan so skip it. *
Jake The Snake Roberts vs. Ted Dibiase- Decent match here to a fantastic fued.  Jake takes a bad count out though and The MIllion Dollar man wins it. ***
Big Bossman vs. Akeem- Bossman and Akeem were tag partners but when Akeem took money from Dibiase the team was broken up and a fued ensued.  Dibiase jumps the Bossman before he gets in the ring and destroys him. Ted then feeds him to Akeem who dominates until Bossman catches him by suprise and slams him for an easy pin. *
Ravishing Rick Rude vs. Superfly Snuka- Snuka's WWF run here was meant ot put other star over.  Rude beats him with relative ease. *
(WWF Champ) Hulk Hogan vs. (Intercontiental Champ) The Ultimate Warrior- Champion vs. Champion!  This was a energetic emotional match and was suprisingly awesome regardless of the wrestlers who were involved.  A great moment in WWF history. ****
Overall  an excellent Wrestlemania.  The best showing since Wrestlemania III in 1987 for sure.  This was the first WWF ppv I ever saw so it holds a special place in my heart and to this day remains my favourite Wrestlemania of all time.  Highly recommended!",1057708800,,3886,4.614264919941776
1003821,4,6305276927,Wrestlemainia 6 can only be summed up in two words:Warrior Hogan. It was the most thrilling match ever. For close to a half hour two of the greatest superstars in wwf history went at it. In the end there was an outcome nobody expected at the time as the Ultimate Warrior beat Hulk Hogan for the wwf title. The rest of the card is mostly forgetable but this Wrestlemainia broke new ground in a lot of ways. This was the first time in wwf history two fan favorates did battle. This event also had the first ever mixed tag match as well as being the first ever wwf event held outside the United States. Buy it!,1031270400,,607,4.241379310344827
1003822,5,6305276927,"THE WAY THE SHOW FRIST STARTED WAS REAL COOL. THE HULK HOGAN AND THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR EVENT WAS NOT SLOW LIKE SID-TAKER,HART-SHAWN AND OTHERS.  I LIKE THE WAY THEY SHOWED THE BACKGROUND ON HOW THESE WRESTLERS STARTED THERE FIGHTS ON SHOWS LIKE WWF SUPERSTARS,SATURDAY NIGHT MAIN EVENT AND THE ROYAL RUMBLE.ALL TO TOGETHER THE SHOW WAS GREAT AS WRESTLEMANIA WENT TO THE 90S.BUY IT NOW OR RENT IT.ITS SO GOOD.

1003824,5,6305276927,"I thought that this has to be one the best Wrestlemania's right up there with WM 14. It had all sort of good matches. The most entertaing match is the mixed tag match between Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire vs The Macho Man Randy Savage & Sherri. If you like brawls, then watch Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Bad News Brown, it is hillrous how Piper looks when he comes down to wrestle for this one. This also features Andre the Giant's last wrestling match ever. But, I think that the event that stands out the most is the Main Event between Huld Hogan and the Ulitimate Warrior for the World Title. Both very popular superstars giving it there all in front of 67,000. It would've been nice to seen the Warrior's career to be better than that one title reign, but I would definitely recommend this tape. It would be a classic for years to come.",1020124800,,827,4.341935483870968
1003825,4,6305276927,WM6 houses the best mian event of the first 17 WM. Hogan vs. Warrior. Champion vs. Champion. Though; my favorite wrestler of all time falls this time; it is still a match for the ages. The undercard is a little lacking which is why it lost a star; but still isn't too bad. A must buy if only for the main event.,1019088000,,311,4.032258064516129
1003826,4,6305276927,"Some people say the Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels is the best main event in Wrestle Mania history. Some other people like me, would argue that Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior is a close second or number 1! This is this biggest epic in WWF history no doubt about it. The clash of the titans. Hulk Hogan the WWF champion. Ultimate Warrior the WWF Intercontinental champion. Battling eachother in the ring at Wrestle Mania! How can anything get bigger. If you are still a hulkamaniac or you love the Ultimate Warrior than I suggest you buy this now! Another good match is Dusty Rodes and the late Sapphire vs. Macho Man and Sensational Sharri. The reason I only gave it 4 stars because all the other matches were boring and aren't worth mentioning. Clash of the titans! This will go down as one of the best Wrestle Manias in history for sure!",1018915200,,838,4.519736842105263

1003884,4,6305276927,"This was one of my favorite wrestlemanias of all time. It took place at the Sky Dome in Toronto with the best main event of all time, Ultimate Warrior VS Hulk Hogan, and to top that it off it was also title for title which means who ever wins gets both the Intercontential and World Heavyweight Championships. I won't till you the end but I will say it has a surprise ending.",989452800,,375,4.222222222222222
1003885,5,6305276927,"This was definitely one of the better Wrestlemanias from a time when there wasn't a wrestling event on ppv every week.  Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior have the most surprising match on the show as it is actually watchable.  Neither man were ever known for their wrestling skill and if you want to see a Hogan-Warrior match watch this one, not their matches from WCW a couple of years ago.
  Wrestlemania VI was the second most successful WM up to this time and has more good matches than bad, but be warned that this is 1990 WWF not 2001 WWF and compared to today some of these matches move REALLY SLOW.  There are several people; Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Earthquake, in early WWF mid-card matches before they became mega-stars.  The funniest part of this tape has to be the Honky Tonk Man/Greg Valentine singing skit (wrestling fans keep a sharp eye out for former WCW wrestler Dallas Page who is there chauffer)
  Celebrites appearing here include Steve Allen and watch for Mary Tyler Moore who looks a little embarassed and uncomfortable to have been picked out by the WWF from the crowd.
  I believe this is also the last Wrestlemania with the announcing team of Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura.  This was in my opinion the best announcing duo the WWF ever had and present the matches on a level far above today's sophmoric level.",988502400,2,1343,4.648305084745763
1003886,5,6305276927,"I haven't seen a man hold two belts since Kurt Angle did before losing them at Wrestlemania this year. I was able to see this, though, because IC champ The Ultimate Warrior won a battle of strength and skill against one of the greatest, Hulk Hogan. With the victory, Warrior won the WWF title and held both belts at the end. But that wasn't the only thing I liked about WMVI, though. Rick Rude vs. Jimmy Snuka pitted two of the most talented WWF superstars ever against each other. Brutus Beefcake cut the hair of the Genius, much to the delight of the fans, after his victory over Mr. Perfect. I liked the rest of the card as well even though I don't remember all the participants, but it was a treat to see Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels back in their days with the Hart Foundation and the Rockers, respectively (whatever happened to Marty Jannetty anyway?). However, Honky Tonk Man should just stick to wrestling, because he can't sing for beans, and I was glad that the Bushwackers broke up his performance. Overall, this was an excellent card that was topped off by a match between two of the greatest of all time, The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan, battling it out for each other's belts. Buy it and you will see why this is the Ultimate Wrestlemania",976752000,2,1256,4.489082969432315
1003887,4,6305276927,"The first and only WrestleMania ever held on foreign soil.  This WrestleMania has a certain uniqueness mainly due to the main event which  featured Intercontinental champion facing Hulk Hogan for his WWF  championship belt.  The main event gets a little slow, but the rest of the  card is fabulous.  Andre the Giant turns face in his final WrestleMania  match when he and Haku faced Demolition.  WrestleMania VI was certainly a  marvelous event that should never be forgotten.",965088000,2,476,5.077922077922078
1003888,4,6305276927,"""Do you want to live forever"" what exactly the Ultimate Warrior and Hulk meant by this i am not sure.  But one thing is for sure if you don't you have to see this match before you pop off.  Possibly THE greatest  match i have ever seen (The recent Cactus Jack Triple H coming a close  second).  While i was watching this i literally had goosebumps with  excitement, i was on the edge of my seat, to say i enjoyed it deserves a  Gorilla press followed by a leg drop.  You MUST see this fight.  The  undercard was a tad disapointing especially Macho Man and Queen Sherri vs  Dusty Rhodes and Saphire. If you wanna know it went as follows: Hart  Foundation v Bolsheviks,  Koko B.Ware vs The Model,  Tito Santana v  Barbarian,  Hacksaw Jim Duggan v Dino Bravo,  Rockers v Orient Express,  Jimmy Snuka v Ravishing Rick Rude,  Roddy Piper v Bad News Brown,  Brutus  Beefcake v Mr. Perfect,  Big Boss Man v Akeem,  Hercules v Earthquake,  Jake  The Snake v Ted Dibiase,  Colossal Connection v Demolition.  But why would  you want to know this just fast forward it to Hulk v Warrior and be amazed.  In fact i'm gonna go watch it again.

7886651,5,6305276927,"The Ultimate Challenge! On April 1, 1990, the second biggest match in World Wrestling Federation history took place at the Toronto SkyDome.  Two of the most powerful forces in the universe came to clash for the most coveted prize in the game; the World Heavyweight Championship.  This match was the main event and pitted the Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior, against the world heavyweight champion, the Immortal Hulk Hogan.  Neither man had ever been defeated by a clean pin or submission throughout the course of their careers since becoming champions, and the wrestling world was in hysterics trying to guess who would win.  It was like Batman going up against Superman and choosing sides was nearly impossible. Nevertheless, the match turned out to be one of the greatest main events in WWF history and was accompanied by an unforgettable crowd.

Although the main event is what most people remember and discuss, the pay-per view as a whole is a very uplifting and enjoyable experience, and is still looked upon as one of the best productions in WWF history.  Other great matches from that night included:

The Colossal Connection vs Demolition for the tag team Championship- An insanely hot crowd for this one.  An entertaining bout which concludes with a bittersweet farewell to one of the all-time greats

Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase vs Jake The Snake Roberts - Another really entertaining bout between these two talented performers.  The crowd as you've come to expect was unbelievable

Mixed tag match - Savage and Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire

Rockers vs Orient Express

7886652,5,6305276927,"Koko B Ware VS Rick Martel: I love Martel as a heel and I wish WWF did more with this guy. A decent match but nothing special.

Demolition VS Haku and Andre The Giant: I'll never know why WWF pushed Demolition so hard. They were the WWF's answer to Road Warriors but in every WWF match ive seen of them, they sucked. Andre was in poor health and nearing the end of his career. Haku was a great wrestler but never used much.

Earthquake VS Hercules: Who cares?

Brutus Beefcake VS Mr Perfect: If Beefcake was not Hogan's best friend, where would he be. Perfect is fun to watch and Beefcake did have his moments. A decent match up with Beefcake getting the upset (in my eyes) win at the end.

Bad News Brown VS Roddy Piper: Piper paints himself half black. Other then that, this match was a crapfest with no clear winner.

Hart Foundation VS Bolsheviks: In the early years of WrestleMania it seemed the WWF tried to crowd as many wrestlers and matches on one card. Thats a good thing but most of the matches were short and ended quickly. The Hart Foundation wins in 19 seconds and talent is wasted.

Tito Santana VS Barbarian: Ive always liked Barbarian, even though he was anther bad guy with nothing to do but job. He put on a good match and the end looked vicious.

Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire VS Randy Savge and Sherri Martel: First ever intergender tag match in WWF history. This match sucked beyond belief and Savage deserved better.

Orient Express VS Rockers: These two teams had a great feud going, this match was not the best but still good. The ending sucked though.

Jim Duggan VS Dino Bravo: I don't care for Duggan or Bravo.

Ted DiBiase VS Jake Roberts: It went ok but the ending sucked. Roberts really never any success at WrestleMania and most of his matches sucked. DiBiase had the tournament and made it to the finals but he never did anything either. Wasted potential on two great wrestlers.

Akeem VS Big Bossman: While some didn't care for this match, I enjoyed it and the timing was good.

Jimmy Snuka VS Rick Rude: Match of the end, no matter how shocking it sounds. They gelled well together for a match that lasted then ten minutes.

Warrior VS Hogan: I don't care if a million people love this match, I thought it sucked. Hogan does his typical shtick and Warrior pins Hogans in the end.

Overall, just like any other WrestleMania. Good matches were short and sweet, alot of bad matches, and Hogan in the main event again.",1235865600,,2445,4.465168539325843

1. Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware 2 stars

2. Demolition Ax and Demolition Smash vs. Andre The Giant and Haku 1 star.. This match sucked...Andre's health was going downhill in this time of his life.. R.I.P Andre

3. Earthquake vs. Hercules 1 star.. Squash stuff

4. Brutus The Barber Beefcake vs. Mr. Perfect 2 1/4 stars.. Not good and not bad.. Borderline

5. Bad News Brown vs. Rowdy Roddy Piper.. 2 stars.. Piper deserved better for Wrestlemania

6. Bret Hart and Jim The Anvil Neidhart vs. Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov-- 1 3/4 stars.. Sorry Bret.. You're my favorite but Vince only gave you a minute..?.. Didn't have time to develop. Nor did Bret have good opponents......

7. Tito Santana vs. The Barbarian- 4 stars.. Yup you got me right.. This match was a great match.. This, in my opinion would be an excellent opener.. Of course Tito took the beating for Barbarian, made him look good, and basically carried this match.. Thats why Tito is another one of the most underrated wrestlers of all time.. Good match...

8. Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire vs. Macho Man and Sensational Sherri-- 1 stars.. This match is very boring.. Macho and Dusty deserved better.. This match is so boring that I've never completed this match without the fast forward button

9. Tanaka and Sato vs. Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty-- I give this match 3 stars.. I enjoyed this match.. And by the way Marty was the main attraction to the Rockers.. And the reason why Shawn took all the bumps is because Marty was older and always hurt.. Marty is another underrated wrestler.. Good match

10. Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo-- Sorry Duggan.. I like your gimmick... But this match gets a 1.. This was a waste

11. Ted Dibiase vs. Jake The Snake Roberts-- This match was sorry in my opinion.. It gets a 1 3/4.. The reason why is it had a few moments but then nothing.. Plus Dibiase is another underrated wrestler.

12. Akeem vs. Big Boss Man- How in the hell can this be the second to last match.. This match was the worse on the card.. So bad I give it 0 points

13. Jimmy Snuka vs. Rick Rude-- I did enjoy this match as well.. Snuka jobbed to another underrated wrestler in Rick Rude.. I give it 2 3/4 stars.

14. Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan-- Well well.. This was the best on the card.. Crowd was into it.. And Warrior ""wrestled"" good tonight and so did Hogan.. People say Warrior repeated moves.. Blah Blah. I say that he put on a good match.. The only thing is.. Warrior was consistently not a good wrestler.. Wrestlemania 7 with Savage beat this..

There was truly great creativity involved in this one, as it unfolded into a masterpiece, that has made legendary history, and is a great collecters item.",1115942400,,555,4.616161616161616
7886656,3,6305276927,"From the Toronto Skydome in April of 1990, this sixth rendition of Wrestlemania should be considered fairly solid entertainment, due to the presence of some entertaining matches mixed with several lackluster ones.  As a result, it ranks somewhere in the middle of the road when compared to other Wrestlemania's.

Here is our rating of the matches on a scale of 1 to 10:

1. Koko B. Ware vs. Rick ""The Model"" Martel: 7/10

A decent opening match -- Martel wins by submission.

WWF Tag Team Title Match:
2. Demolition vs. Champions the Colossal Connection
(Andre the Giant & Haku) w/ Bobby Heenan: 4.5/10

The match should more accurately be billed as Demolition vs. Haku.  As you may know, Demolition gets a three-peat as champions, but Andre grabs the spotlight as the crowd favorite at the end by disposing of Heenan and Haku after they blame him for the loss.

3. Earthquake w/ Jimmy Hart vs. Hercules Hernandez: 5/10

Hernandez's wily enthusiasm initially is entertaining, but the match ends as another squash for Earthquake.

4. ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig w/ ""The Genius"" Lanny Poffo vs. Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake: 8/10

Surprisingly good!  Beefcake snares the upset win over Hennig.  In the post-match shenanigans, Hennig heads for the showers while Brutus escorts the hapless ""Genius"" back to the barbershop.

5. Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown: 4/10

Despite some decent chemistry together, their wild brawl ends in a pointless double count-out.

6. The Hart Foundation vs. the Bolsheviks: 5/10

Comedian Steve Allen has some musical fun in the locker room at the Bolsheviks' expense just before they go out and drop a fast one to the Harts.  The only reasons we rate this one as high as a ""5"" is for Allen's tongue-in-cheek participation and that Bret Hart mercifully saved viewers from watching a likely terrible match by ending it in mere seconds.

7.  Tito Santana vs. the Barbarian w/ Bobby Heenan: 7.5/10

Much better than expected.  Despite a valiant effort, Santana's losing streak at Wrestlemania inexplicably continues.

8. Randy Savage & Scary Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire (with surprise guest Elizabeth): 6/10

Awful match.  The ""6"" rating is probably generous if only for Elizabeth's classy presence and the fiery Savage's valiant efforts to salvage what little spark he can from this tag team debacle.

9. The Rockers vs. the Orient Express: 7.5/10

Pretty routine stuff, but at least it is worth watching.  The Orient Express steal a surprise count-out victory over Michaels & Jannetty.

10. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo: 2/10

Have 2 x 4, will travel, as Duggan loses by DQ.  The Earthquake then makes a cameo appearance to squash Duggan for no apparent reason in this subpar brawl.

11. Ted DiBiase w/ Virgil vs. Jake ""The Snake Roberts: 8/10

One of the event's best matches ends in a count-out win for DiBiase, but Roberts then gives his nemesis a crowd-pleasing payback (pardon the pun) by stuffing a wad of cash in an ""unconscious"" DiBiase's mouth.

12. Big Bossman vs. Akeem: 1.5/10

After DiBiase makes a surprise appearance, it seems like a good time to make a break for the refrigerator.

** Rhythm & Blues (Honky Tonk & Greg Valentine) ""perform"" their new song before being interrupted by the Bushwhackers.  Also, look fast for Diamond Dallas Page driving the pink caddy, which brings the villains to ringside. 3/10

13. Rick Rude vs. Jimmy Snuka: 3/10

Rude wins in a dull filler match.

WWF Championship vs. Intercontinental Championship Match
14. Hulk Hogan vs. the Ultimate Warrior: 8.5/10

It resembles a plodding game of ""H-O-R-S-E"" watching Hogan and the Warrior trade their best moves.  Still, the match is exceptionally good considering the participants involved.  Hogan does deserve credit for appearing to surrender the WWF World Title with grace in the Warrior's shining moment.

Overall, if you can find ""Wrestlemania VI"" for a reasonable price, it should be worth your investment as long as you keep moderate expectations.

Also, as a note, beware of the cheap E.P. mode with this video: the picture quality will not likely hold up over time.",1115078400,4,4103,4.969117647058823
7886657,4,6305276927,"This Mania is in many ways very similar to WrestleMania V

Obviously the characters are the same, but the main thing is that both Manias have weak undercards and classic Main events, which are worth the price of admission.

The card

1. Koko B. Ware vs. Rick Martel - ok opener. 2 1/2 *

2.  Demolition vs. Collosal Connection (Andre and Haku)- match was so so, but Demolition gets the gold and Andre turns face so that's cool.

3.  Hercules vs. earthquake - next

4.  Brutus Beefcake vs. Mr. Perfect - Pretty good match.  Both wrestlers had some good moves.  only complaint might be that it was a little long.  3 1/2 * s

5.  Rowdy Roddy Piper vs. bad news Brown- what a waste of Piper's talent.  1 star

6.  Hart Foundation vs. bolshieviks - Next

7.  Tito Santana vs. Barbarian - 2 * clothesline as a signiture move ???

8.  Dusty Rhodes and Safire vs. Macho Man Randy Savage and Queen Sheri- just like it sounds.  Even Savage isn't able to save this

9.  Rockers vs. Orient express - dissapointment.  Probably Michaels Mania lowpoint.

10. Dino Bravo v. jim Duggan - Next

11. Jake the Snake vs. million Dollar Man - NEXT !

12.  Jimmy Superfly Sunka vs. Rick Rude - NEXT !!!!!!

13. Hulk Hogan the World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Champion vs. The Ultimate Warrior the Intercontinental Champ.

This match is one for the ages.  Both men give a great performance.  Hogan built up the WWF and Warrior put a surge of energy into it.  The match gets better as it goes on.  With the ref down Hogan and then Warrior look as though they'd have got the pin.  Hogan gets the Gorrila Press but kicks out of the splash.  In the end Hogan misses the leg drop and Warrior pins him with a splash.  GREAT STUFF.  !!",1112832000,2,1710,4.37620578778135
