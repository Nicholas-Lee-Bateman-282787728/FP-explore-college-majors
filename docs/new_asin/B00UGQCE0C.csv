8706393,5,B00UGQCE0C,"Friends and family of the four girls murdered in the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church remember their lost daughters, sisters and friends with grief that resonates as strong 50 years later as when it happened.  The quest for justice took far too long, and was incomplete when ""achieved.""

Their story is all the more powerful in this century, when certain politicians are actively trying to roll back the Civil Rights Act of 1963, gerrymander voting districts and prevent certain demographic groups from exercising their constitutional rights.  Hate groups have come out of  hiding to endorse their agenda of hatred and domestic terrorism. The legacy of Denise, Addie, Carole and Cynthia cannot, must not, be lost yet again.  They paid for our civil rights in blood.  Don't let their sacrifice be in vain.

Spike Lee has left us a powerful memoir to the four children who were murdered, and the wounded who survived.  This film should be required viewing for every government, Social Studies and American history class. Five stars aren't enough.",1483401600,,1063,5.068965517241379
