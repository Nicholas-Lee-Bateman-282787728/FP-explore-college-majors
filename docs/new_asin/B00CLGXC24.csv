5726013,5,B00CLGXC24,I have watched this drama so many times and to me each time I watch it its like I'm seeing it for the first time.  A really good drama.  If you like fantasy stories I think you will enjoy this drama.  On top of beautiful stars it has the best sound track ever.  I love time travel stories and its even better this time because it is done tastefully.  The subtitles are done very well.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  By the way I am a Lee Min Ho fan.,1370995200,29,457,3.7473684210526317
5726014,5,B00CLGXC24,I just got done watching this series and it's my new favorite.  Way better than Boys Over Flowers or City Hunter!  It was my first that dealt with Characters from ancient Korea.  I like the idea of a modern day woman getting thrown back in time. I was not much of a Lee Min Ho fan except in City Hunter but now hes definitely on my radar. It's an emotional roller coaster that has you wanting more.  The entire cast was great and many of the supporting cast were memorable and deserve to be recognized.  This is also a drama that has a lot of fight sequences for the guys while all the romance an intrigue a girl could want. If you love Korean Dramas this one is for you!,1369699200,8,671,4.130769230769231
5726015,5,B00CLGXC24,"I purchased this drama series for my grandma for Mother's Day because she loves Lee Min Ho.  It arrived on time with neat packaging. No complaints about the service. Thanks!!! I know this story is really good because I've seen it before, and the ending was nice. You can easily find a synopsis about it online if you wanna hear about the story. I think it's a wonderful drama! The setting and time period are interesting, Lee Min Ho was great, all the actors were cool...I recommend it for any age group, especially because the action aspect of it is pretty appealing.",1368748800,29,568,4.568627450980392
5726023,5,B00CLGXC24,"The Great Doctor is a fictional love story about a Plastic Surgeon who is kidnapped from a conference in 2012 and transplanted into a past time of Korea; to save the new wife of the King (Queen).  Believing that she, the Doctor, is from heaven many within the ruling class attempt to use her as a pun to gain power.  The General of the Kings guards becomes enamored with her and attempts to keep her safe until he is able to return her back to present time Korea.  Violent but filled with intrigue.

Everything about this drama is wonderful, from the beautiful story, the beautiful music, the beautiful cast, the great performances, the love story, the historic drama - just everything.  Lee Min Ho is the heart and soul of this drama - but the entire cast is just wonderful.  I have no issues with sub-titled movies.  It is so hard to not binge watch this drama - but now that I own it I can do better at this.  DVD works perfect with no issues.  Product came on time and as promised.

5726032,5,B00CLGXC24,"This is a fabulous piece of entertainment. When it was on Netflix, I watched it all the way through 3 times! My enthusiasm for it attracted my wife who subsequently also watched it all the way through three times. Now that it's gone from Netflix we bought it to watch again (and again). It is a beautiful production with something for everyone. There is wisdom, humor, two very different romances and lots of martial swashbuckling. It takes a little patience getting through the first two episodes, which include animation, time-travel and a lot of whining by the kidnapped doctor. But these two episode are critical to the plot, so stay with it and then relax and enjoy the rest of this elegant and exquisite historical drama.  The only other drawback is that sometimes they speak rapidly causing the subtitles to fly by too fast. So the first time through we needed to pause when that happened so we could catch all the dialog. It was absolutely worth it..",1473724800,3,958,4.7023809523809526

The advertise guarantee that is good quality and price is not cheap, so expecting but look as they are copy with bad one, otherwise the subtitle in English is very good.

After months of slowly making my way through, I was disappointed to find that some of the last episodes would not play.  I carefully examined the disc and discovered a manufacturing flaw I had not seen before.

5726045,5,B00CLGXC24,"This is a time-travel/historical drama that is both romance and fantastic! Although some of the martial arts are a bit cheesy, the story does more than enough to make up for it. A plastic surgeon from our present is brought back in time to the feudal era through a ""heavenly gate"" to save a dying princess. There is mythical powers and a major twist in the plot which makes it that much better! The ending is sweet and endearing. If you love Lee Min-Ho he plays a great character in this drama.",1451433600,,494,4.380434782608695
5726046,5,B00CLGXC24,"I've become a huge fan of K-drama, and Lee Min Ho, because of this show.  It takes a bit for an American viewer to get used to the way Korean dramas are written.  The good guys don't always win, and the bad guys get away with A LOT.  But if you can get past your Hollywood induced expectations, this drama is great.  The lead actors/actresses are very good at their craft which makes the characters come to life.  My only problem with the entire series was the actress playing the ""doctor"", who annoyed me through the first few episodes.  The other characters more than made up for this though.

I love the way this show was shot in such interesting and beautiful scenery.  The period costumes were fantastic.  Overall, it gave me a feeling of watching a slice of a culture I'd never seen before.  The story is part fantasy, but the main characters are actual historical figures in Korea.  I've been inspired to check out a lot of Korean history thanks to this series.  It's also lead me to explore other historical dramas from Korea and China.",1449187200,7,1044,4.49468085106383

I am surprise to learn that this is suppose to be a commercial failure, in my mind this one of the best Korean drama that was ever produce
i believe the audience the audience did not give it time to mature, but if you watch thru the end, you will realize the depth of the love between the warrior and the doctor. the ending was good, but I wish they added more scenes to give the viewers satisfaction of seeing more of them together
but in all, it is still an outstanding drama, the setting, the acting and even the soundtrack is superbly done.

It has enough light hearted moments to temper the grisliness of the era and still do justice to the seriousness of the character's situations.

5726063,5,B00CLGXC24,"I love HK cinema but couldn't get into Korean martial arts movies but this series completely got me hooked on K-dramas!!  I first saw it on Netflix but it's no longer there so had to buy it.  Each time I've seen it, the plot gets thicker & I appreciate more character nuances.  The bad guys are SO BAD and conniving & the Emperor & Empress so precious and tragic & the main character doctor is so hilarious & annoying but really grows as a person.  Even time travel & sci-fi-esque aspects, especially in the beginning.  Anyway, this was my first Korean drama & now I'm hooked:  I also highly recommend City Hunter, Coffee Princes, that's Okay it's Love & You're All Surrounded which I'm saving up for!!  Also great about this one & City Hinter is there is usually a fight scene in each which is pretty decent although not Donnie Yen the Koreans really know how to build tension & drama & suspense!  Real nail-biters and you can't stop at the end of the show, only when u collapse from exhaustion, so that's one disadvantage to getting the whole series at once, being late to work the next day....",1428278400,,1096,4.445

5726065,5,B00CLGXC24,"Fantastic series! My favorite K-drama. My whole family could watch this series over and over.

The subtitles leave something to be desired though. They leave out all the honorific titles you can hear the characters saying when they speak their lines like 'Prince of Court' or ""Woodalchi General'.  They also mistranslate the little bits of random English in the show like the word ""psycho"". It makes me wonder what else has been left out of the translation, or done incorrectly. If you are expecting the same translation used on Netflix, you won't find it on these DVDs. I'm glad I watched this on Netflix first so I know what was actually said!
The DVDs also had scratches on them in the 'factory sealed' case.",1426550400,,711,4.725806451612903

5726096,5,B00CLGXC24,"I watched this one recently on netflix and knew I wanted to own it. Unlike many Korean/Japanese dramas that end up with two or three men jealously fighting over the same girl, and her going back and forth trying to choose, a lot of the drama that happens in this story occurs when bad things happen to two people who are truly, deeply in love with each other. And though there might be a couple of suggestive love interests to try and take her away, in the end, she's just not interested in anyone but him. Another thing I like is that it isn't just the main characters, but the entire story has relationships that are pure of heart, including the one between the king and the queen. A lot of relationships in dramas can come off a little shallow at points, but this one is a lot deeper.

There is real chemistry between the hero and the heroine which makes it so believable. The action in it was exciting to watch! It's incredible the way they wield those swords!

There was great action and adventure.  I have so many favorite scenes but the one that sends me thrilling is when the character Choi Young played by Lee Min Ho leaps upon the wall and rescues the princess. He is fighting the enemies left and right. He is an excellent swordsman. I guess by the time this scene happens and the music is carrying me through it is riveting!  Lee Min Ho is such an attractive man but he is also a great actor. I first saw him in Boys Over Flowers which I thought he played that character well.

This drama is an enjoyable gift that I will watch for years to come.  The ending was sweet and definitely shows there is hope for true love or Faith.",1401408000,,840,4.148148148148148

It turns out that there are many so-called K-dramas. We've seen Empress Ki, Five Fingers, Arang & the Magistrate and then my daughter suggested this one as it sounded intriguing. This show is a winner from the start. Perfectly cast, lots of action, many facets as has been mentioned. You love it on so many levels because it is filled with romance, humor, action, mystery, tension, quirkiness. There is an 'arty feeling' about it also. I am reviewing this show because I love it so much and want to order it, but it's a bit expensive for me right now. Just a hint: Many of these K-dramas are available on Netflix and Hulu Plus - check for availability. I DO want to own this story as I plan on watching it several more times at least. I hope Lee Min Ho, the young actor who plays the warrior, expands his career to include English-speaking movies. He's so good, but as I said, you will be pleased with the whole cast.

5726105,5,B00CLGXC24,"I believe reviews of tv series on dvd should distinguish between the series itself and the particular implementation on that dvd set.

Series:
This series is my all-time favorite kdrama and the only one so far that I have purchased on dvd after watching on TV.  The music is great.  Female lead Kim Hae-Sun is adorable.  Kim Mi-Kyung is memorable (as usual) in a supporting role as Court Lady Choi.  The chief villain works -- he is so over-the-top he ought to be awful, but they pull it off and by the end you may even feel sorry for him.  It drags a bit in the middle (maybe it should have been about 18 episodes instead of 24) but they nailed the first episode and the 2nd half of the finale.  Choi Young's visit to ""heaven"" in ep 1 alone is worth the price.  The time-traveling doctor's use of English in the 14th century is great -- where else do you get to hear ""X-Men"" and ""FBI witness protection program"" (in English) in the Mongol era and have it make sense ?

References to future events are touching if you know enough Korean history.  Look up Queen Noguk & Yi Sung-Gye if you watch it.

It was broadcast in my area as ""Faith"".  As near as I can tell, that word only appears once in the series, near the end of the finale.  The word matters.

DVD implementation:
OK, nothing outstanding but no terrible flaws, just one LOL flaw.  The story summary on the back of the box (""tells the story of medical officer Gyung-chang"") has NOTHING to do with the actual contents.  Someone must have gotten confused with some other kdrama set in the Koryo period and featuring a doctor.  Whoops.

Has Korean & Mandarin Chinese soundtracks; Korean/Mandarin/Malay subtitles.  I went with Korean & English.  Not a lot of special features, just some ""previously on"" type bits at the start of some episodes (which I like) and some ""making of"" stills at the end of the finale.

Although it is supposed to be region 3 and not playable in North American players, and the box says ""ntsc 3"", it played just fine in my BD player.  I was prepared for a struggle with VLC region settings, but that wasn't necessary.  I believe the disks I received are actually ""all region"" with no copy protection.  I don't know what disks you might get, but it seems other reviews were also able to watch it ok.

Sad note:
Per Wikipedia, the series got decent ratings but cost so much to make that it was a financial flop.  People weren't paid, lawsuits were filed, and the show-runner committed suicide.",1400457600,,2472,4.47427293064877

5726111,5,B00CLGXC24,"The time travel film has finally reached Korea with FAITH, THE GREAT DOCTOR. This is a film that combines a host of genres: sci-fi, romance, historical costume drama, and philosophy. A modern day female doctor in Seoul is kidnapped by a 15th century warrior (Min-Ho Lee) to tend the wounds of a critically injured queen. From this brief summation flows numerous plot twists, most of which revolve around a 21st century doctor forced to use primitive technology to save numerous injured people. There is of course romance. The Great Doctor and her kidnapper slowly fall in love, both of whom know or fear that someday somehow she must return to her own time, which her warrior-lover refers to Heaven. Others too know of heaven, including an evil nobleman who wants to visit Heaven before he dies. There is plenty of swordplay and a surprising amount of what can only be termed Tai Chi mind control that comes off very much like magic. This was a magnificent cinematic experience that kept me totally involved for each of the 24 episodes. A similarly themed time travel movie called DR. JIN was released the same year; if you liked THE GREAT DOCTOR, you will probably appreciate DR. JIN as well. Both movies explore the infinity of possibilities when time becomes elastic enough to permit one to potentially change what must otherwise be seen as historical necessity. THE GREAT DOCTOR allowed me to care about characters who guessed that their pasts, presents, and future might have in store some unplanned events.",1394928000,,1512,4.88715953307393

The fighting was somewhat stylized and not too bloody, which I liked, and the blossoming love interests were portrayed in a very subtle and beautiful way.  The costumes and the music were beautiful too.  The English subtitles were interesting and even a little amusing at times when the word choices and phrasing were a little different than how we would say it. This series is clean and refreshing and can be viewed by the whole family.  I saw it first on Netflix, and it has become one of my favorites.

I was not familiar with this type of genre, but I decided to give it a shot, since I was pretty much tired of the  stuff thats on tv nowadays. Wow was I in for a great surprise! After going through the first episode I was hooked.  The plot line may sound cheesy and silly but the story is well written , and it is a very fun, clean entertaining mini series. This series is about a warrior from the Goryeo era whose  sent out to find a healer ( doctor) to cure the princess,  add some time travel, and you have modern day plastic surgeon from Korea brought to another time period.  I loved the characters, and the developing story lines within the series. This series has  a combination of pretty much everything, time travel, action, comedy, romance, suspense etc  At times it was a little hard to follow just based not he complexity of the plot and the multiple characters involved, but all in all it was really great. If you're into time travel/ historical kind of romance,  with a strong male lead, and with very independent and quirky female lead then you will like this series. I would def recommend it!
 I liked it so much that I bought DVD for it, just so that I could watch it anytime  without having to rely on online streaming.

Info on the DVD/ series:

5726119,5,B00CLGXC24,"This is the best K-Drama I have seen. The acting by Lee Min-Ho is far superior to that of any actor I have seen, especially the minor details of facial expressions and the expression of feeling that is so strong that you can't help but to feel what that character must have felt.  Some have complained about the English Subtitles beings sub-par but I would disagree. I first saw this on Netflix and then ordered it from Amazon, I watched it again as soon as I received it. The English subtitles are better than that which was used on Netflix. There were times on Netflix where the character would say 3 or 4 sentences but the subtitle would only show a basic sentence, giving you  the feeling you were missing a lot of detail in the story. When I watched it from the disc's I ordered from Amazon, the subtitles were very good and I understood the show a lot better do to the subtitles showing what was actually said instead of a basic summary of the conversation.

I also loved the relationship between the king and the queen, and all the funny scenes of the warriors.  Loved all the fight scenes too - some blood, not too much violence.

They aren't ""bad"", but they certainly aren't the best.  Why is it that the best subtitles are the ones online?  Whenever I buy a drama on DVD, they don't use the best subtitles.  Sadly.
I guess some people find this drama to be too slow moving.  I didn't - I enjoy the slow build up in the story.  I won't talk about the story, but it's definitely my personal favorite of Lee Min Ho's.  He is always very believable in any role he plays, and I've enjoyed them all.  But I have to say - he certainly looks his best as an ancient warrior.  :)
There are 5 discs in this set, and there are slots for 6 - which confused me for a second.  Also, I'm watching it on my computer, since I can't remember if my DVD player is a non-regional one - so if you're concerned about not being able to play it in your DVD player, you can always use your computer.

This is one of the most engrossing and emotional TV series I have ever seen---all 24 episodes, viewed almost non-stop. I could not pull myself aways from this stunning tale.

There are more plot twists, turns, heart-stoppers, and surprises than even I---a thrillers author---could ""take,"" or foresee, or ""plot."" I was constantly on the edge of my La-Z-Boy. This was a great premise, a great story, and the acting and strength of characterizations were amazing. I have never seen such well-defined characters and portrayals. I have never seen a stronger story spine, driving the action forward nmon-stop, even when in periods of supposed repose. The writing---from a writer's point of view---was just absolutely masterful.

I have seen better costumes, and way better subtitles, and the two ""twins"" were irritating, but after awhile you really don't notice.

See it! Buy it if you want, you will watch it again and again :)",1386633600,,924,5.065789473684211

When Queen Nogoog (Park Se-Young) is critically injured, Choi travels through a time portal to 21st century Korea and abducts the ""God's Doctor Eun-Soo (played by Kim Hee-Sun).
Loved the story of ancient, honorable warrior who meets and than slowly falls for quirky, modern day doctor. The chemistry between Lee Min-Ho and Kim Hee-Sun was great. I also enjoyed the growing relationship/love between the King and his Queen.

5726129,5,B00CLGXC24,"Avid Lee Min Ho fan...let's state that fact right up front.  Have watched his acting progression from Mackeral Run, I Am Sam, BOF, Personal Taste, City Hunder to FAITH.  While CITY HUNTER remains my absolute favorite Lee Min Ho vehicle, FAITH is a very, VERY CLOSE second.

Between the story and the sound track (also purchased), this drama hits all the triggers for me in a good way.  I've watched this drama 3x just this year (2013).  While my husband does not really understand my fascination with K-Drama's much less my 'fan-dom' for Lee Min Ho, he did enjoyed FAITH with me.  His favorite character was the baddy bad guy!  He got the giggles whenever the bad guy had some weird happen to him.  The look on his face was priceless.

While the abducted doctor is admittedly older than Choi Young, she is the perfect match for him.  Young-ah had to grow up fast in that time period, so the age difference was a non-issue.  She made him laugh and feel loved.  The pairing was perfect to me.  The action scenes with the music back-drop gave me chill bumps.  I would cheer, fist punch & clap along with the battle.  {Did I mention that I was weird for K-Dramas?}

5726131,5,B00CLGXC24,"I discovered this drama after watching it on Dramafever. After watching it there a couple of times, I decided I wanted to have my own copy. Korean dramas are very popular so it's easy to get fooled by bootleg copies especially if you're a Korean drama novice so I make my purchases carefully.

Since I was not familiar with this distributor, I immediately watched the entire DVD series as quickly as I could because I wanted to be able to return it if the product was inferior in any way. I am happy to say that this DVD series is high quality (no skipping or scratches, good sound) and I'm keeping it, so there! ;)

The subs were pretty good, although there were a few typos here and there. They use British style English so Americans might be a bit perplexed by some of the word choices and question their accuracy. Since they had more time to fine tune the translation, they should be better than the subs on sites like Dramafever, which have a very short time from the time the episodes air on Korean TV to post them to an international audience.

I am not going to review the drama itself, except to make a couple of quick points that will not give away the plot. This is one of those rare dramas where you are rooting for both main couples to have a successful relationship. The actors who played the King and Queen were especially cute.

If you watched Tae Wang Sa Shin Gi (The Legend) starring Bae Yong Joon a few years back, this drama is almost a 5 year Legend reunion. Several of the Legend cast members appear in cameos or significant secondary roles. Many of the filming locations will also bring dejavu to Legend lovers.",1378080000,33,1634,4.4186046511627906

He played the lead role in this drama - Choi Young, a real Korean historical figure. This is a historical-fantasy drama. The story starts out with a new Korean king returning to Korea (Goryeo) from Yuan where he has been held hostage for many years to take up his throne. Choi Young and his men are escorting the royal party. Assassins attack, the queen is dealt a lethal slash on her neck. Choi is sent through the ""Heavenly Gate"" to retrieve the Great Doctor who is alive and well in Korea 2012. The doctor turns out to be a down-on-her-luck plastic surgeon whose only goal is to make enough money to start her own practice. Here comes Choi, fearless and determined to fulfill his King's orders. He kidnaps Yoo Eun-soo (Kim Hee-seon), the doctor, and hauls her through the portal and back into the past. To her, Choi is a psychopath and Goryeo is only a dream or a modern day drama. I enjoyed this drama. I loved the sword play, the fight scenes. Lee Min-ho played the confident, intelligent warrior very well. I love watching him wield a sword and fight.

This is my favorite k-drama yet...right up there with City Hunter, Lee Min Ho delivers once again! :D along with the rest of the fabulous actors/actresses in this series",1373328000,14,700,4.563492063492063

8583077,5,B00CLGXC24,"I watched this series on Netflix several times, and was disappointed when Netflix ""retired"" it.  I kept hoping they would bring it back, but when they didn't, I searched for my own copy.  At first, it was difficult to find a copy that didn't have a disclaimer about only playing on certain machines.  Then, I found this copy without the disclaimer.  I was so pleased.  The discs played flawlessly and for the uncountable number of times I've watched the series, I am very pleased.  Love the story, although the main female character is a bit of a spoiled rotten brat who got on my nerves until she finally came around and started using her doctoring talents for good.  All the characters were well developed.  The side story of love and marriage between the King and his bride was lovely.  Even the bad guys were very well played.  Loved, loved, loved the action scenes!  If these people didn't do their own tricks, the camera hid it well.  Certainly a series that can keep the interest of a person over many weeks.",1498780800,,1015,4.5777777777777775
