1972067,4,B00015HX5E,"It's true that some child stars (Jodie Foster, Ron Howard, Shirley Temple) go on to successful, extraordinary adult careers, but there seems to be an unusually high rate of child stars who go on to do things that earn them tabloid front page coverage (the cast of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" comes to mind most easily, I guess). More than all the scandalous stuff, there's also that very simple question of how you succeed as a grown-up when you've already achieved the highest levels of fame as a child, and the very process of adolescence and maturity robbed you of what gave you that fame, when the cute little kid in that TV show becomes...(in this example) a guy who looks like David Spade? So, former child actors face that hurdle, and some choose to just get out of show business altogether (the ""Brady Bunch"" kids mostly did this, though some have since come back). This movie addresses all that in a very comedic way.
TV child star of the '70s, Dickie Roberts is now 35 and parking cars at a trendy Los Angeles resturaunt. Craving to regain the spotlight, he auditions for a role of a normal guy in the new Rob Reiner film, but the director quickly sees he is anything but normal. Desperate to win the part, Dickie hires a family to help him replay his childhood and assume the identity of an average, everyday kid.

This all makes for a very clever, extremely funny, and highly entertaining comedy. This is a cute film with Spade in top form--it's nice to see there are still roles for him. It's all very predictable, but makes for fun family viewing (despite some innuendo). Cameos by actual child stars add to the fun. Stay for the credits for a hilarious song about what it's like being a child star, sung by actual child stars themselves!",1056412800,,1744,4.5718849840255595

He joins a family with a mother grace, 2 kids sam and sally and a father who pays little attention to his kids and only hires dickie for his pleasure to be in a commercial. The kids call him stranger danger but they grow to really like him. He does some crazy things dye his nautrally blonde hair brown, make himself a water bed, ride in a baby stroler and offer the kids beer but it pays off the family puts on a fake christmas for him so he can pretend to get a bike he gets to be in the film. But also he falls in love with grace cuz her husbend ran off with dickie's ex girlfriend. When grace has no money at christmas for gifts there dickie is and he bought a lot of gifts.

1972151,5,B00015HX5E,"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is a 2003 comedy directed by Sam Weisman and stars and co-written by David Spade(Tommy Boy, Black Sheep). This film tells the tale of Dickie Roberts(Spade), a former child celebrity who once was the most popular stars of the early 1970's and now down on his luck. When he heard that Rob Reiner(who portrays himself)is looking for the lead actor for his upcoming film, Dickie would do anything for his carrer to be resurrected. At the advice of Reiner, Dickie re-live his childhood and moves in with a Los Angeles family and turns their lives upside down. The cameo appearances by Emmanuel Lewis(Webster), Dustin Diamond(Saved By The Bell), Danny Bonaduce(The Partridge Family), Corey Feldman(The Lost Boys), Leif Garrett and other former child stars was a ture treat for any fan of the classic TV shows. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the film, deleted scenes of the film, a Comedy Central special of Dickie Roberts, an extended version of the music video featuring a cast of former child stars including Erin Moran(Happy Days), Todd Bridges(Diff'rent Strokes), Tony Dow(Leave It To Beaver), Butch Patrick(The Munsters), and others as well as trailers for other Paramount film favourites.

As a child, Dickie Roberts was very famous and apart of a tv sitcom, but when he got older, he was washed up and nobody cares about him. He tries to make a comeback by getting into Rob Reiner's new movie. Rob tells him that he needs to relive a normal childhood in order to get the part, so Dickie hires the Finney family to adopt him for a month. It's edgy at first, but soon Grace, Sam, and Sally begin to like him. Will Dickie become a permanent part of the family, or try to become a star again? I highly recommend DICKIE ROBERTS: FORMER CHILD STAR!!!",1250121600,2,690,4.118518518518519
1972166,3,B00015HX5E,"David Spade's signature apathetic sarcasm gets my funny-bone every time.  I find his comedic style hilarious.  I think it's the tone of his voice, the way each comment rolls out of his mouth with this tinge of arrogance that makes him one of the funniest comedians working today.  Even when his films are ridiculous and utterly pointless (which, honestly, a lot of his films are) he is still on point and delivers the goods.  In `Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star' he fails to disappoint yet again, serving up one hilarious gag after another.  While there are parts of `Dickie Roberts' that don't fit for me, as a whole I actually think this comedy works rather well.  Sure, Spade has a lot to do with that, but plot wise too; it's actually quite an interesting concept.

The story is that of Dickie Roberts, you guessed it, a former child star.  Now all grown up and feeling the after effects of fame gone `bye-bye', Dickie strives to once again capture the hearts of the American public.  The only problem is that Dickie didn't have a normal childhood.  He was famous at a very young age, abandoned by his mother after his show was canceled and thus doesn't know what it's like to be a normal person.  That drawback makes it impossible for him to land any substantial parts because he can't play `normal'.  So, to fix this problem he does something so very un-normal and hires a family to `his' family so that he can get a feel of what it's like to be a normal kid.  That said family is the Finney's; George and Grace and their two kids Sam and Sally.

It's apparent right off the bat that, while the Finney's are kind of storybook they still have some real problems; clich&eacute;d problems if you will.  George is a workaholic who has become disinterested in his wife; Grace is the kindhearted `golden' mother, the kind that Dickie didn't have; Sam is the nerdy kid who's bullied at school and Sally is the slightly obnoxious little girl who has a heart of gold.

A lot of what happens in `Dickie Roberts' is predictable if not a little `out there' but it's all presented in a way that makes it easy and fun to swallow.  A lot of the gags are delivered effortlessly and are quite entertaining (the whole `demon rabbit' scene alone is worth the price of the DVD) and Spade is always one to keep his dialog (no matter how dense) fresh and funny (it's all about delivery).

David Spade really understands Dickie mostly because I think there is a lot of Spade in Dickie.  Mary McCormack is beautiful and sincere as Grace, but there are some issues I have with her character (mainly the whole `Dickie likes Grace, Grace likes Dickie' thing).  She's the picture perfect mother, and she is one major clich&eacute;, but she makes it work the best she can.  Scott Terra and Jenna Boyd do a fine job playing typical kids, if not a little exaggerated and Craig Bierko is pretty good as the very unlikable father George.  Alyssa Milano is hilarious as Dickie's ex-girlfriend Cyndi and John Lovitz continues to get laughs as Dickie's hard working agent.

The ending is very `Hollywood' but what else did you expect; you could guess the ending from watching the trailer.  I still give it a solid three, three and a half stars.  It serves up the laughs, plenty of them actually, and never grows stale.  With cameo's by a slew of former child stars not to mention some pretty famous faces, `Dickie Roberts' is funny, witty, entertaining and all around enjoyable.",1207094400,3,3450,4.587275693311582
1972167,3,B00015HX5E,"In DICKIE ROBERTS: FORMER CHILD STAR, David Spade took an idea he originally had for a Saturday Night Live sketch that never aired and revamped it to portray the title character, Dickie Roberts, a child star of a family sitcom in the 1970s who entered the phrase ""Nuckin' Futs"" into the American lexicon.  Dickie's success kept him from having even a semblance of a normal childhood and after the sitcom ended, he soon found himself down and out and unable to get cast in any worthwhile projects.  Dickie Roberts was just another child actor whose life became tainted by his former celebrity.  In his mid-30s he finds himself parking cars and competing in a ""former stars"" wrestling event just to pay the bills.  Dickie learns about a project, a movie, that he believes will help him re-launch his career.  The director thinks Dickie might be good for the role, but doesn't think he can relate to normal people.  Desperate to win the role in the much covenanted film, Dickie hires a family, the Finneys, to expose him to everything he missed out on in his childhood.  Mother Grace (Mary McCormack) isn't very excited about the venture, but Dad George (Craig Bierko) won't look a money-making opportunity in the mouth.  As for kids, Sam (Scott Terra) and Sally (Jenna Boyd), they aren't very happy at first about the arrangements either.  However, mother and children are able to overcome their initial hesitation and reluctance and find in Dickie a companion soul that's really just looking for the family love he never received while growing up.  Yet, even though the Finneys appear to be a normal family, they have problems of their own, problems that become exasperated by Dickie's presence.  Dickie has to decide to continue in his research or to help heal the wounds of his hired family.

Child actors have an incredible difficult time in life when they grow up.  Most grow up secluded from the world outside of Hollywood and by the time their shows are cancelled or they are no longer cute enough to be cast in movies, they usually have a difficult time adjusting to a world without fame.  It's a sad commentary about the evil of show business.

Yet, it's also an area that was ripe for being parodied.  I just wasn't sure David Spade was the right guy to do it.  After all, since the death of his partner in comedy, Chris Farley, David Spade has become an actor that tends to be more grating than he is entertaining.  He's made a few bearable movies since Farley passed away, such as JOE DIRT, but for the most part he has ruined every project he has starred in, e.g. 8 SIMPLE RULES FOR DATING MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER.  Of course, Spade does have a very fast and witty charm to him that ended up making him perfect for the role of Dickie Roberts.

The movie has a few clichs, yet it's basically a homage dedicated to all the former child stars of Tinseltown.  The movie parodies their lives, yet gives them a portion of dignity, too.  That's not to say the movie is all social commentary and not funny, because there are some very funny parts.  It's just that the movie comes off as being more of a humorous movie of affection rather than a disrespectful laughing shamefest.

I actually saw it for the first time on a cable movie channel, and I wish I had seen it sooner!  There are so many hilarious one liners tossed about in this movie, and Spade's delivery on those snarky one-liners is impeccable.  So much of the comedy is not in what's being said, but how it's being said.  This is not a change-the-world type of movie, but if you're looking for a light-hearted comedy with some heart, this one will deliver.

The film shows this dilemma in the grown-up former child star with simple signs, like the gloves he is wearing all the time. But how can such a grown-up who has had no childhood learn what it is to be a child ? The film is rather hilarious even if at times it is a little bit gross. It also reflects a little bit on what kind of straight jacket society imposes onto children, particularly about the famous four-letter words, forgetting that  nucking futs  are immediately translated by all kids in what they really are. At times though the humor of this film is a little bit simple like a grown up man in a perambulator. Why not in diapers ? Would you really let a grown man sleep in the same bedroom as an eight year old girl and a twelve year old boy ? Or maybe both of them slightly older ?

I was told that it wasn't that good and that it wasn't Spade's best work - not measuring up to Tommy Boy, etc... I will admit that Tommy Boy was more memorable, but Dickie Roberts was quite a bit better than I was expecting it to be. I wish I had seen it sooner.

David Spade is the perfect actor to play this role of a washed-up former child star on the skids. He believes that he's still part of the ""in crowd"", but he always finds himself on the outside. The side of Spade displaying his quick-witted insults and harsh nature serve him well in this part and he does an excellent job with it.

The storyline is rather ridiculous, as is the case with most movies of this genre, from the SNL crew, but again, it hardly seems to make a difference. The movie is entertaining and lighthearted - not meant to be taken too seriously. I thought it was hilarious. There are some great one-liners, which Spade seems to have built his fame upon.

I've always been a fan of Spade because he was that type of dry sarcastic humor that makes him unforgettable (kinda like Andy Dick) so when he's smarting off the the fat lady that lives across the street or messing with his ex-girlfriend he's at the top of his game.  The funniest scene in this film has to be when they think their dog has killed their neighbors bunny.  The whole scene is just hilarious and will have you laughing days to come...yeah that and the part when he's talking about the hot mom with her kids and he asks the son Sam ""just pretend she isn't your mother""...I was on the floor...This is a great fun flick to watch and enjoy.",1140998400,,837,4.346153846153846

Honestly, I had absolutely no intention of seeing this movie, but it was important to a friend of mine and somehow she convinced me to go with her. I like comedies, but I don't like things that are slap-stickish or that are geared solely for the pleasure of 12 year old boys.

I was pleasantly surprised with Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. This movie was incredibly funny and I loved watching Barry Williams, Leif Garrett, Corey Feldman, Danny Bonaducci, and Screech playing poker. Every game they play, Barry raises the stakes by adding souveniers from the Brady Bunch episodes telling them they can easily make money on ebay.

The movie is slightly absurd but it is hilarious. For me, it is funny because there honestly are people who think and act like Dickie does. They got so into the idea of fame that they would do absolutely anything to ""make a comeback"" even ride around in a baby stroller and go ""ga-ga goo-goo"".

I also enjoyed the children in the movie. They are so smart and witty and really hold their own against Dickie. They open up a whole world to him that he's never experienced before: a normal childhood. In the beginning, they hate him and make fun of him, but as they get to know eachother, the children learn from Dickie how to be self-confident and Dickie learns the value of love.

While some of the jokes are crude, they work for David Spade in a way that another actor would find it hard to get away with. David is able to combine a childlike wonder and innocence with vulgarity in such a way that you never completely dislike Dickie. There is enough hope and sincerity that you find yourself pushing for him even though he goes over the top to get what he wants.

Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is also filled with wonderful oddities like a celebrity wrestling match between David Spade and Emmanuel Lewis (of Webster fame), visits to AA and Lamaze, the Barry Williams poker games, and a witty song at the end featuring various child-stars from the 70's and 80's.

1972174,3,B00015HX5E,"Former child star Dickie Roberts (David Spade) was big in the 70's with a hit TV show.  Now, as an adult, he lands an audition in a Rob Reiner film to play a ""normal"" kid.  Unfortunately, he's anything but normal.  So Dickie hires a family to teach him a few things about being a kid.  He puts an ad in the paper and receives several calls back.  Dickie picks the ""low maintenance"" family, the Finney's.

This family includes a mom Grace, a dad George, their two kids Sam and Sally, and a dog named Popeye.  Grace is interested in interior design, and because her husband George dismisses the idea and makes her feel guilty about it, their marriage is on the rocks.  George is never home and probably knows nothing about his kids.  Sam gets bullied at school and Sally is in competition with the popular girl at school, and both are auditioning to be on a team.

Dickie stays with the Finney's for a month.  He teaches Sally a dance routine for the school talent show.  He talks to Sam and gives him advice to talk to a girl he likes.

There are so many great scenes in this movie.  One of my favourite scene is when the family dog Popeye digs up the neighbour's dead rabbit and brings it to Sam and Sally.  Of course, everyone thinks that the dog killed it.  They all bring the dead rabbit in the house and wash it and before the neighbours come back, they put the rabbit back in the cage.  The neighbours see the rabbit in the cage and cry ""devil rabbit"", and because of this, the neighbours move.

1972179,3,B00015HX5E,"'Dickie Roberts -- Former Child Star' starts with a wonderful mocumentary style, which cleverly uses the 'archives' of the title role Dickie Roberts (played by David Spade), who was a popular child star on TV back in the 70s.  Now, having lost everything, he dreams of the comeback, and today he joins in the celebrity boxing match with Emmanuel Lewis.  And Dickie  loses.

In spite of a good support from Jon Rovitz, the film then begins to falter because of its contrived plot with a sugary and predictable ending in view.  The film tells how desperate Dickie can be, trying to get a role in the new film by Rob Reiner (who appears as himself).  Rob kindly asks the former child star to 're-live your childhood.'  Which means, Dickie Roberts must learn to live a normal life in a perfectly all-American family in suburbia (with the mother Mary McCormack), and teach something about life to the kids, or be taught by them.

Now David Spade keeps the ball rolling anyway, doing impersonations of ... er ... jet-ski or motorbike, which are very energetic but unfunny.  Still, he carries the show pretty well though never showing better ideas than the opening sections, in which you can see several cameos including Tom Arnold and Brendan Fraser (Dickie insists on saying 'Fraijarr)'.  And you can also see Alyssa Milano (who was the little daughter of the star of 'Commando')

Perhaps you might be most interested in the end credits, where a group of real-life former child stars appear and sing a comic song.  You want to see the Brady Bunch kids?  Here they are.  And a bit of Corey Feldman or Corey Haim singing together.  But of course, it is the film itslef that really matters, and that is done by Sam Weisman of run-of-the-mill 'The Out-of-Towners' and 'What's the Worst That Could Happen?.'

I especially liked him as the voice of Kuzko in the Emperor's New Groove. Here he plays Dickie Roberts: (former) Child Star, a kid at the top, but a man at the bottom and absolutely desperate for a comeback.
His agent (John Lovitz) cannot find him any work outside of celebrity boxing, his girlfriend has dumped him and Dickie's main source of income is parking cars. You get the picture, he's a completely fallen star.
Rob Reiner has a role that Dickie would love to get his hands on but Rob won't touch him because it requires an actor who knows 'normal', someone who knows how to be an adult, someone who had a proper childhood. Desperate to get the part, Dickie hires an ordinary middle-class family (dedicated mum, workaholic dad, bullied son, wishful daughter) to look after him like proper parents.
Trouble naturally follows. But Dickie's hijinks lessen and his new family's tolerance increases. Yes, they do learn from each other and become better people (yadda yadda) but there is just so much fun and craziness along the way and some genuine character moments.
There are loads of celebrity cameos (Tom Arnold, Corey Feldman, Brendan Fraser, Dustin Diamond) and lots of biting satire and the movie industry but the bulk of the film relies upon Dickie learning family values and having fun with the kids, being a kid. Proof positive that he's still the best (former) SNL star.
The only bad thing I can mention is Adam Sandler's involvement as executive producer, something that seriously tarnishes the film and prevents it from having any real class.

Well through the first fifteen minutes or so my prediction was pretty much ""on the money"".  But then, things started to change:
Not only does David Spade's acting change during this movie, but many of the stars come to the rescue.
Jenna Boyd as Dickie's adopted sister ""Sally"" gave an amazing performance.  Look for this young actress to have a very promising career.  Her character could not have been played any better by anyone.
Scott Terra as Dickie's adopted brother ""Sam"" was also perfect in his ability to make the movie more believable.
Mary McCormack as Dickie's adopted mom also carried David Spade through-out the flick.
All-in-all, I enjoyed this movie.  I found the scenes with Dickie trying to learn how to ride a bike one of the funniest ""watch the guy get hurt"" moments in any movie I have seen.  If a person doesn't laugh at those scenes, they must be dead!

Add to this the flurry of 70s & 80s nostalgia specials airing daily on VH1 and E! and I began to look forward to seeing ""Dickie Roberts.""
But, sadly, the movie basically never gets off the ground.  The viewer knows right away that this is going to be a movie where the potential was wasted.  A brief send-up of ""The E! True Hollywood Story,"" which starts the film, has a couple of funny lines, but not nearly enough to indicate that the rest of the film will keep you interested.  Like ""Joe Dirt"" (and any number of SNL-alum movies), the central character in ""Dickie Roberts"" is basically a sad-sack who yearns for love from those around him, and most importantly, his own family.  However, after years of movies like this, in the year 2004, you're simply just asking yourself, ""Again?"" as the paperthin plot is revealed.
The movie *almost* redeems itself (kinda) with the ""We are the World""-type closing credits video, ""Childhood Actors of your TV,"" performed by the likes of Maureen McCormack, Barry Williams, Corey Feldman & Corey Haim, Screech (sorry, Dustin Diamond), and Haywood Nelson.  Haywood Nelson should get his own movie.  Who didn't love Doowayne?  Anyway, even this great premise falls flat, and instead of a laugh riot (which it very well should have been), it's cringeworthy watching Adam Rich and some of the other childhood actors recite their lines.
But, if you have seen and like this movie, I will recommend you getting the DVD as there are a lot of extra features, from commentaries, to deleted scenes, to an extended-video of ""Childhood Actors on your TV"" and more.  I give the movie 1 star, but the camp and train-wreck that I consider ""Childhood Actors on your Television"" to be gets 3 stars.  So, that's how I came up with my 2 star rating.",1078358400,4,1927,4.641176470588236

1972201,1,B00015HX5E,"I like David Spade and I thought JOE DIRT was his best movie.  This one is terrible.  I don't think I laughed once.  Spade plays a washed up actor who decides to pay a family to give him the childhood he never head, so he will have the experience to play a roll in a Rob Reiner film.  Spade cracks lame jokes throughout and ends up with the family's mother.  (The father was a creep and Spade behaved himself throughout, so no need to shelter the kiddies.)
The only good thing about this film was the appearance of former child stars like Leif Garrett, Danny Boniducci, and Barry Williams.  If they had had larger parts the movie might have been funnier.  At the end during the credits a large group of child stars assemble to sing a ""We Are the World"" type song.  The only reason I gave this POS a star.

The idea is really good but it is poorly executed and you feel like the actors are trying too hard for a laugh.  It does have maybe 4 or 5 parts that you will probably laugh at, but for the most part you will be trying to figure out who all the grown up, former child stars in the movie are.

1972203,4,B00015HX5E,"Many SNL alumni have made awful movies that unsucessfully try to inject sentimentality into a silly comedy, which results in a dull, uneven mess. I'm a fan of David Spade, but his post-Chris Farley movies haven't been up to snuff. However, ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star"" is NOT another ""Joe Dirt"" and it's second only to ""Tommy Boy.""
An eccentric former child star from the '70s (David Spade) desperately wants a comeback, but is resigned to parking cars at a restaurant. After hearing about a new Rob Reiner movie that's expected to be huge, he begs his ineffective but well meaning agent (Jon Lovitz) to get him an audition. When he finally talks with Reiner, Dickie finds out that his troubled past will prevent him from playing a normal character. To remedy the situation, Dickie decides to relive his childhood to live the life he should've had. He moves in with the Finneys, a family that seems sitcom-perfect but have a less-than-rosy life. Dickie only adds to their problems at first, but in the end the family learns from Dickie as much as he learns from them, and he discovers what he really wants out of life. The movie's premise is a little weird but it holds water; using past experiences to map your approach to a character and the character's emotional levels are vital to making an acting performance work well. It's not surprising that Rob Reiner thought that Dickie wouldn't be able to do it correctly.
For the most part, I can't complain about the acting. Dickie has Spade's trademark sarcasm mixed in with believable naivete, peculiarity, and sincerity. The father (Craig Bierko) is convincingly smarmy, and Mary McCormack is perfectly cast as the sweet, gentle mom. As for the kids, adorable Jenna Boyd plays Sally Finney perfectly, and is a young actress with a lot of potential. On the other hand, Sam Finney (Scott Terra) is a very flat character. Dickie describes Sam as a ""cool, funny guy,"" but we never get to see anything that resembles a distinct personality in Sam. It doesn't help that Terra talks too fast and mumbles his lines. Rounding out the cast are lots of funny cameos from celebrities and real former child stars, who are included in a hilarious music video at the end of the movie.",1076976000,2,2227,4.757105943152455
1972214,2,B00015HX5E,"With American soldiers fighting over in Iraq and problematic situations across the world flashing across American television screens everyday, it is no wonder why the comedy has become the genre of choice amongst the movie-going public. Sitting back in a comfortable theater seat and learning to laugh once again has such an enlightened quality that we crave so much now. If only the comedies that were offered were worth laughing at, in a good way. Spring offerings like Shanghai Knights, Bringing Down the House, and Anger Management weren't worthy of the moderate acclaim and box office dollars they brought in. The summer season had much more tempting features with the likes of Bruce Almighty and Freaky Friday with only the gross-out third installment of the American Pie series, American Wedding, really paying off in the long run. Now as the box office begins to slow down after the last hurrah of the summer (Labor Day weekend), one has to wonder if any new releases can resurrect this failing genre.
This is the story of Dickie Roberts, one of the most famous television child stars Hollywood had ever seen and how quickly he fell from the pinnacle of stardom. Dickie Roberts, at the age of six, became an over night sensation with his role on a charming television show thanks in part to his crooked smile and repetitive catch phrase ""That's nucking futs"". But once the hit television was cancelled by the network, Dickie Roberts fell from the mind of the public and lost his career in the process. Now thirty years later, he desires to have the fame and love he once had so long ago but being a valet for a restaurant doesn't get you too much publicity. When the role of a life time becomes available to the former child star, he is willing to do anything to get it including hiring a family to live out the childhood he missed. But when the ""perfect"" family he hires is less then enthusiastic about his stay, Dickie must learn not only learn to be a child again but must also learn to love again to help his ""foster"" family. The story of Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star makes a mockery of the E! True Hollywood Story. The fact that just one episode of the acclaimed series is ten times more entertaining then this film should come as an embarrassment to the filmmakers. The more embarrassing fact is that the parody song that plays during credits is more humorous then the other eighty-two minutes of this feature. No wonder they tacked it on at the end! They featured all those child stars in order for the hate mail to go to them and not the studio.
The cast of this live action film plays out much like one of a made for television feature, which is not always a good thing. Poor David Spade! The former Saturday Night Live! cast member, after the dud that was Joe Dirt, has become the John Lovitz of comedies. As an added bonus John Lovitz himself stars in the film along side Spade adding unnecessary emotional sadness to the film. But seriously for a moment, Spade, who is also a writer for the film, works out pretty well in the beginning but screeches (No pun intended for another former child star) around the half-way point. Granted he blurts out some humorous lines every now and again but he loses his charm and becomes corny and cheesy. Another sad sight in the film was Alyssa Milano's role as Dickie Roberts' on/off girlfriend. With such a wonderfully entertaining role on the WB's Charmed, it boggles the mind why such horrible roles are offered to her or why she even accepts them. Jon Lovitz isn't featured in this film as much as he probably should have and when he is seen, he really isn't funny. Now on to Dickie's ""foster"" family with each role being diagnosed instead of the performers as their names aren't recognizable (and with the film as it is, it is better for their careers that they aren't mentioned). The children are amazingly annoying from the beginning with crappy lines like ""stranger danger"" and ""schiats"" beings spoken by these sickingly cute kids every five seconds. More could be said about the family but nothing good, so better to take a breather from the constant ranting.
Overall, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is a horrible disaster from beginning to end. Though not as disastrous as The Hulk and 2 Fast 2 Furious, the film doesn't give too many good qualities to talk about. How can this feature be called a comedy when barely a snicker was blurted out during the film's nearly two hour run? Any slightly entertaining moment that does peek out has been used in every trailer and television ad so many times that all charm is squeezed out of it. The creators of this feature should not only be labeled as failures but as perverts as well with a disturbing scene involving a twelve year old girl (who had obviously not reached maturity yet) sexually dancing to ""I Want to be Bad"". Dickie Roberts does have its charming family moments but they are so few and far between that they really aren't worth mentioning. The bottom line is that Dickie Roberts makes a night watching Nick at Nite and TV Land look like must attend event. Here's hoping that the fall season isn't as disappointing as the first outing away from the summer heat.",1073692800,,5195,4.6355748373101955

1972217,3,B00015HX5E,"Dickie Roberts, Former Child Star marks the return to the big screen of the likable and talented David Spade.  Spade has made a career of playing characters that are somewhat petulant and childish, and therefore playing the part of a former child star seeking to return to his previous fame comes as no stretch to his acting talents.  He is though, sadly let down by a weak script that, after setting up an interesting concept, never quite delivers on it's promise. The plot is clichd and blindingly obvious, and yet manages to be strangely and unexpectedly touching in the end.  However, the middle part of the film grate as trite and pointless set pieces and one-liners are strung together in ever-increasingly ridiculous fashion.  An example of this lies in the treatment of the former child stars that the movie drags out.  As every clich about excess and vanity is spat out, the former child stars ham it up for the camera in a way that, while supposedly mocking the ""I'll do anything to be famous again!!"" streak displayed by many ex-famous people, instead appears to be a desperate cry of ""I'll do anything to be famous again!!""  It's demeaning, it's tasteless and in many cases (the sing-a-long at the end for example) it's just cruel, and painful to watch.  Someone should've put these people out of their misery loooong ago, and dragging them out every year to poke fun at them is as vulgar as it is unnecessary.
Overall Spade is good, watchable and likable, and the two actual child actors help him carry the film better than might be expected.  My personal advice is rent this one, or buy it and then give it to someone else for Christmas - I doubt you'll want to watch it a second time.",1071964800,,1699,4.621262458471761

Don't let that or the fact that this movie takes some time(not a lot of time mind you) to get going, discourage you from seeing this above average comedy. Dickie Roberts, once a childhood TV star is no longer famous.  Adopting a family seems like the logical thing to do to recapture a lost childhood and convince the viewer that Dickie is truly sad and feels he has missed out on something valuable.  In addition, the viewer must take another step in believing that Dickie hides his pain with sarcasm and indifference. Convinced on both accounts. I laughed quite frequently and ""teared-up"" once or twice(being of the male species I can't publicly admit to crying). Watching David Spade crash a child's bicycle into various objects was hilarious.  Done before in other movies? Yes, but funny nontheless. And watching Dickie Roberts slowly bond with the two children of his adopted family that initially despised him was engaging.  Again, done before in other movies.  But still nice to see.

1972234,5,B00015HX5E,"There's a scene in ""Dickie Roberts Former Child Star"" where Dickie, played by David Spade, is playing poker with a large group of former child stars. Being a fan of old 60's-80's television shows, I found that I did reconize at least more then half of those stars. And when Barry Williams, who played Greg on ""The Brady Bunch"", was giving away items from some of the classic episodes from the old sitcom, I was laughing away in my seat.
""Dickie Roberts"" is a form of comedy where even thought you know what is going to happen, it's still funny because of the way that it is brought out. It's done in a way that everything that you know will probally happen, happens when you least expect it. It's like watching a normal comedy, with everything happening out of order. Predictable, but surprising, if you could understand what I'm saying.
The movie opens like an episode of ""E! True Hollywood Story,"" where you learn a brief history of Dickie Roberts as a child star and Dickie Roberts as an adult. When he was a child he was the star of ""The Glimmer Gang"", with the famous catch phrase of ""This is nucking futs."" He never knew who his real father was, and once the show went off the air, his mother abandoned him. Now years later, Dickie is a thirty five year old parking valet, who wears gloves twenty four hours a day, who gets dumped by his girlfriend Cyndi. He finally decides to tryout for the new Rob Reiner film ""Mr. Blakes Backyard"", and he tries to get an audition from his agent, Sidney Wernick(played by Jon Lovitz perfectly.)
After meeting with Reiner, he decides that Dickie looks just like he pictured when he wrote the script, but he is afraid that Dickie will not be able to handle the emotional aspect of the film, because he never experienced the main function of adulthood, which is a childhood. Reiner tells Dickie that he is waiting a few months to decide who will get the part, giving Dickie an idea. He decides to put an ad in the newspaper and hire a family to treat him like a kid for about one month, so he could see what it was like to be a kid. After some horrible meetings with people, he ends up on the driveway of The Finneys. Car salesmen dad George has agreed to the plan without talking to his wife, Grace, of their two children Sally and Sam. None of those three like the idea of having a stranger living in their house, but they agree to let him stay and for the next few weeks, Dickie experences what it is like to be a normal kid, without the fame.
I like David Spade. I liked ""The Adventures of Joe Dirt,"" and I liked him on the now cancelled show ""Just Shoot Me."" So naturally I was excited when I learned that he was going to be in this movie. Everybody worked well in this. All of the actors and actresses looked like they were all having a good time, which is good. I feel that it is a shame that this movie did not make as much mony as it did. So soon, if ""Matchstick Men"" is sold out(read earlier review) go see ""Dickie Roberts Former Child Star.""",1063584000,10,2992,4.316163410301954

1972236,4,B00015HX5E,"Sometimes it's okay to have a little fun. Sometimes it's okay to laugh and snort a little. But should you admit it to the world when the film is DICKIE ROBERTS FORMER CHILD STAR? I'm going to but that's only because I'm a tad bit brave and I sure time will tell and many will come to embrace this fun movie.
Dickie Roberts (David Spade, The Adventures of Joe Dirt) was a former child star. At the age of 6 he had the whole world screaming ""This is Nucking Futz"" his signature line. After the show got cancelled poor Dickie was left out in the cold by everyone he loved. He grew up to be a valet at a trendy LA restaurant.
Now Dickie wants more out of life and he thinks that begins with a role in a new Rob Reiner film. So to make a long story short he hires a family, to relive his childhood, so he can prepare for the role. This is when the fun and frivolity begins.
DICKIE ROBERTS is the best thing that has come out of Happy Madison productions. It's smart and funny, and for the most part tries to keep the laughs coming. It's also the only Happy Madison film not to feature Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider. Hmm??
What works in the film far outweighs what doesn't. I loved the celebrity-boxing match with Emmanuel Lewis; the stilt dance, and even the slip and slide scene. They all work, and make you laugh. Spade himself brings that lovable sarcasm and caustic wit to the screen. It's the best he's ever done, without Chris Farley.
What doesn't work is that it gets incredibly bogged down with sentimentality. Who is the guy in Hollywood saying that these movies need all this fake drama? That the music needs swell, and lessons need to be learned? I just want a funny movie. DICKIE ROBERTS in not the worst offender, but it teeters pretty close to that line.
Mary McCormack (Private Parts) is delightful as Grace, the mother with a heart of gold. She's the kind of actress that lights up screens and is vastly underrated. She has so much charisma and raw power. I wonder why Hollywood doesn't use her more. If I were a power player she's would be making 20 million and Julia Roberts would be a supporting player.
Even the kids (Scott Terra and Erin Murphy) are pretty good. Murphy is far better than Terra but he has some really great scenes that work.
I do question a scene in which a girl, who can't be more than ten, slinks around like a slut. I understand why the scene is in the movie. I just thought it was tacky and went on far too long. It's made everybody in my party squirm.
But other than that, I recommend DICKIE ROBERTS for what it is. A fun movie, I also recommend you stay for the closing credits, you'll get to hear Marsha Brady well... I won't tell you. But the scene also shows Fred ""Rerun"" Perry getting down. Some of the best closing credit moments I've ever seen and it beats having to watch stupid outtakes.
If you're in the mood for a little light fun DICKIE ROBERTS FORMER CHILD STAR is a good movie for you.

Being disappointed with the mere gross-out comedy of Joe Dirt, I was hoping this would be a lot better (I'm a big Spade fan, but I try not to be an overly *biased* Spade fan....I don't love every single piece of his work).
I wasn't disappointed this time.
Dickie Roberts is a washed-up former child star who hangs out with the likes of Corey Feldman and Danny Bonnaduci for poker on Thursday nights. He longs for another shot at the spotlight; not necessarily for the money, but to regain the attention of his mother, who left him when his career did.
His only friend who's really stuck with him since he was young - his agent, Sidney - tells Dickie that there's a new Rob Reiner film called Mr. Blake's Backyard. Dickie thinks this could be his way back to stardom. He goes to see Mr. Reiner, who is sympathetic with Dickie, but tells him that since Dickie never had a real childhood or true adulthood, he would never be able to properly convey the character.
So desperate, Dickie actually hires a famliy for $20,000 to ""re-live"" a childhood. And so comedy ensues, as you could probably tell. Some jokes fell a little flat but for the most part it was hilarious. My boyfriend who was a little reluctant really ended up loving it.
But not only is it funny, it has heart. I really loved the family scenario that Dickie grew to love more than wanting to be a star. He learned what it really was to have love.

He really stole the show with his lines. If they had kept up that type of humor throughout this film, they would have had something really special here. Unfortunately they didn't so it falls flat in most every way.

This movie should have been right up my alley as a child from the 70's and 80's. Too bad the real former child stars were SO UNDERUSED. I mean, come on, Leif Garret? Danny Bonaduce? Corey? I would have LOVED to see them more and be able to remember their lines but they were so forgettable. Just SEEING an old familiar face isn't enough. Shame Shame Shame on the scriptwriters for letting go an opportunity to let these child stars give an actual performance. The potential here was astronomical but, yeah, I get it. David Spade's the star. And a pretty unfunny one, at that.

Too many slapstick scenes...the bike, the water wiggle. None of that worked for me. So obviously done by stunt men. I've never watched David Spade before and doubt I will again. He's just a little too cocky and smarmy. And the scene with the little girl dancing was such poor taste and went on way too long. Who really thought that was funny? Anyone? Poor taste all the way.

I found myself cringing at the end song. Another missed opportunity. Hearing Marcia Brady drop the F bomb really wasn't so funny. I was dying to see Nicholas Bradford but cringed again when he sang in a Mickey Mouse voice. Oh, I could go on and on about the atrocities in this movie.

My hope is that someday someone does this movie again and does it right.",1514160000,,1694,4.437299035369775
