8061987,1,B0009JOMVA,"I was going to order the 2nd volume of Mary Hartman only to find out: #1 It's not on DVD,  but VHS! I don't have a real problem with that since I have a combo-player. However, the reviews have showed that the tape is a rip-off! Missing episodes which obviously makes it harder to follow the story. Also, it is extremely short, timewise.  Why doesn't someone create a decent, professional Volume 2? Then, and only then will I by it!

8061988,1,B0009JOMVA,These are just the same episodes as released on sony volume 1 which I had already purchased. Total waste of time and embarrassment to me personally as I had bought it as a gift for my mother and she was eagerly awaiting the new episodes of one of her favorite shows. Turned out to be a complete bust.,1281312000,11,300,4.189655172413793
8061989,5,B0009JOMVA,"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman was an awesome series when it first aired in 1976.  It ran for 325 episodes and was a soap-opera parody as well as a legitimate soap-opera in its own right.  It was unbelievably popular during its initial run and became a pop-culture phenomenon.  It was definitely Norman Lear's most popular show, surpassing All in the Family in notoriety when it debuted on syndicated TV.  But for some reason that I fail to understand SONY Pictures and Columbia Tristar will not release this classic series on VHS or DVD.  At least we have the two volumes of The Best of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman to remind us how well-done this show was.  But the 6 episodes included on these tapes are just a tease.  Come guys at SONY!!!  You're sitting on a gold mine.  Bring back Mary Hartman.  It is long overdue.",1150848000,27,815,4.558620689655172
8061990,3,B0009JOMVA,"I was very disappointed at the short viewing time, not to mention the preview for other videos located at the beginning of the tape.  Also, there were episodes missing inbetween!  This was a continued series, and didn't make much sense out of order and missing episodes!",1120176000,26,270,4.8478260869565215
