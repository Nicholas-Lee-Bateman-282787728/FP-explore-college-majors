7897587,5,6305907900,"This is one of the best surfing movies I have ever seen!! Sure, there are the adrenaline movies like Riding Giants. This is not that kind of movie. Any surfer will love this movie because it gives us a warm and fuzzy glimpse into the days when there were still virgin waves to be discovered in the world. My favorite part is when they introduce surfing to Japan in a little fishing village. Needless to say, the local Japanese are delighted and blown away to see surfing for the first time!  Watching this film is nostalgic and full of warmth. It's a slow pace, but completely mesmerizing. In fact, I could watch this on a loop for a year and never get sick of it. Every time I watch it, I catch new little techniques I can try.  These guys had big heavy boards, but they surf like they are on floating on air. What a graceful style. STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!",1368489600,,864,4.327160493827161

If you are going to buy it, purchase it along with the 7 others in The Ultimate Summer Bruce Brown Surf Collection. Not worth it as a stand alone. (Just wanted to get a real review posted since the first one is so bad! IMHO of course!)",1297209600,,317,4.213114754098361
7897589,3,6305907900,"This is a must see.  Of course, what would go really well with rich French cosine?  A bottle of wine.  Well, the same analogy holds true with this movie.  To truly appreciate the vastness of the ocean, the killer waves, the surfers battling mother nature, and most importantly the hot bodies the actors posses, you need at least an oz of mushroom.  Incorporate the mushroom into your salad.  Italian dressing works the best.",977875200,,424,4.739726027397261
