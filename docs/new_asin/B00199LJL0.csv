I was passing through on my way to Corpus Christi,Texas at the time. I stopped there because I knew the town somewhat from my college days at Texas A&I University in Kingsville,Texas. I  stopped there to rest because I was battling the flu virus. I checked into a two bit , flea ridden motel for the night. I got bored and wanted to see if I could rent some videos and a portable VCR(remember those?) .I was allowed to rent the videos and VCR which I promptly took to my motel room and settled down to watch them. I was mesmerized by this movie! The music to begin with was awesome! It totally blew me away. For years I tried to find a copy of this movie with no luck. I was able to find a local video store that rented lots of old Spaghetti Westerns as well as other Itallian movies from the 1960s through the 1980s. Thanks for the memories!",1392681600,,986,4.216931216931217
