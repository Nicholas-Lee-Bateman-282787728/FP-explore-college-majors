5963566,5,B00F1W1SKI,"I watched this show the night it occurred live from the comfort of my living room, and it was an amazing night.  After 1/2 hour or so of recorded interviews with people talking about Jerry, the concert itself went on from TRI studios in front of a small but dedicated audience, with many guest musicians, featuring Bob Weir as master of ceremonies.  Over a period of 4 hours, Bobby took only a short break, otherwise he was playing the entire night.  Every song they played was a song Jerry himself sang, either with the Dead or his solo band.  I feel very fortunate to have witnessed this event live, I have nothing but praise for Bob Weir and TRI studios for hosting this event and other events for free on the internet, and for making this DVD available for us to enjoy in the future.",1382400000,4,787,4.406896551724138

Truly inspiring seeing, young singer's collaborating with Bob Weir. The two best songs of the evening for me was the ""Mission in the Rain"" and the ""Terrapin Station"" and both are on this official release. The day after this show was rebroadcast on Sirius/XM and I hoped that it would be released as a CD set but it looks like they did one better with this DVD.

Originally aired as a web stream over the internet, TRI edited the footage taken and released it as this video. I watched the stream as well, so I know all the differences. This isn't as much the streamlined concert that the web stream was, but the songs are split up a bit more and content is added between them.

5963581,1,B00F1W1SKI,"How to put this?
I fear the negative angel on my shoulder is winning so....

What the hell was that?

Let's start first with the cons:

1. Jerry Garcia Family LLC?
Can I go out on a limb here and say that LLC is all Deborah (No, she can't be that bad) koons' doing?
and while I, unfortunately, have Ms. Koons in mind: where was she during this film?
A film about her husband and she's nowhere to be seen? No reflection on Jerry she wants to impart?
Maybe I'm wrong about her intelligence--maybe she is smart enough to know she shouldn't show her face after all she's done after Jerry's been gone.
2. Phil, Mickey and Billy.
Apart from a token scene at the beginning with Phil on bass; why don't they play together in this 2 hour movie?
 A weak interview with Billy (Justin's K's (the Director of this tribute) dad, no less), a scene from a few years ago of Mickey at an event honoring Jerry--couldn't they have a sit down and reminisce?  I mean, this is for posterity for God's sake.
3. Donna jean.
Should have exited stage left - forever- after she and Keith left the band .
30 years on the road; all those different people who interacted with Jerry and how many people were interviewed to talk about it?
Carlos Santana--sounding head-up-his-ass as usual.
Jorma Kaukonen was at least coherent--poor Jack Casady looked barely there--who knows? he didn't say anything.
One of the guys from Los Lobos was a nice (short) touch.
It was nice to see Jerry's brother Tiff--would have liked to hear a lot more from him regarding his feelings towards his brother.
Surprised to see MG there; considering her relationship with Koons--didn't really say anything of any depth, but, Hell, at least she was there.
The most glaring absence, however, was the man who wrote the words to the majority of the tunes that Jerry sang--for close to 30 years.
A man who, along with Tiff, Phil, Billy, Bobby and Mickey, knew Jerry the longest.
Hunter.
My better angel, the less cynical of the two, tells me it's because he wanted nothing to do with a project that would benefit Deborah Koons in any way--good on him.
In reality, however, Koons probably banned him.
So, that leaves me with this:
 Bobby, what the Hell were you thinking?

pros:
The musicians were really good at playing and singing the songs they selected--the guy who sang Terrapin was great.
They played note-for-note perfect--maybe that was the problem.

Finally. I'm stuck with with image of big Bill Walton standing in the back, pseudo-heads ""dancing"" in front of him; he had the look of a man at a funeral--now, maybe he was just sad because he was remembering how much he loved and missed Jerry;
Or maybe he was thinking "" this just ain't right""",1428019200,5,2691,4.58004158004158

5963585,5,B00F1W1SKI,"Anything that tells story' s about Jerry Garcia , hopefully pre 1978 memories is fascinating . It is well made , production very good. I,m not a jam band guy. I,m a Jerry Head . He was/is a major creation unto himself . Cherubic , smiling , unconcerned with trivial nonsense that dictate to us our own lives !!  His sound will be in my ears when I slip away . I wish there was were versions of songs by Jerrry/Bob Marley , my two favorite outliers who were larger than life in this world . Two guys that could make society great if everyone thought about humanity like them . One side note . I am a Donna lover . I,m not interested in Mydlands plinkety plink keys and no more female back up singing. . I always wished the Dead crushed the industry and were insanely wealthy w/great management . Then (in my fantasy world ) they could have hired a staff of Doctors and nurses to look after Jerry , get him off cigarettes and even inject him with the right amount of heroin/opiate he needed to be comfortable ( This is a definite in the future .... rehab is proven failure and opiates are great for people who fall heavily into them , needing them due to permanent brain chemistry changes and lobbyists are only reason any drug users suffer anymore. All withdrawal and non high opiates exist in Big Pharma waiting until they make money ) Anyway , Jerry and the band , circa, 1974 could have stayed together until now , healthy ,happy ,performing nice mellower , more structured sets w/their fans happy as clams.  And The Jerry Garcia Band , my favorite playing small venues all over . My point about Donna on this dvd is she annoys whoever is singing by staring at them too much and too many hand gestures . She used to fit in on stage like one of the boys in 73 . She is great . Jerry Garcia has one of most unique sounds ever , can play about 27 notes in two bars and make it back for the changes/chorus /etc. and it  sounds like a beautiful cascade of sound. really incredibly gifted and unique.",1422662400,,1996,4.261213720316623

5963596,2,B00F1W1SKI,"Notice how many of the positive reviews dwell on the ""Good Ole Grateful Dead""-nostalgia trip hype? Of course the Dead's fan boys all like this tribute. But let's consider that Garcia squandered his otherwise prodigious talents by living a drug-addled life, and  the messy details of his private life were the stuff of legend. Yes, it is Jerry's image and playing with his former bandmates and his solo projects that remain the money-generator for the remaining Dead members and Jerry's relatives, thru the release of old concert tapes. They are cashing in on poor ole' Jer's legacy. It isn't personal, it's only business. He would be embarrassed by the shameless promotion attached to his reputation and legacy.
So here is a concert/interview disc with mostly covers of his material by other musicians, eh, I have heard my share of Dead cover bands, thanks. You probably have, too, but you don't realize that yet.

I can't know how much better the Blu-Ray might look, but the image on the regular was great.

The version of Mission in the Rain is absolutely fantastic, and made me an instant fan of Jonathan Wilson, who I have since researched and will be buying his albums.  Another artist I was not aware of is Jim Lauderdale, and I'm looking forward to picking up some of his work as well.  The only thing I wish they had done was maybe create as an extra a place where each contributing artist was spotlighted - name, band, etc. - because there are a lot of people on the scene, but only those who get interview time are named on screen.

This film is going to be for true die hard fans more than someone just getting into Jerry's music. I do recommend it to all but there will be those who love it and those that don't.

5963619,3,B00F1W1SKI,"This is a fun and interesting concert film with some good interviews, but Deadheads beware!  The list of stars of the film includes Bill Kreutzmann (who does not play at all, but contributes a couple good stories), Mickey Hart (who also does not play, but has one ~20 second comment), and Phil Lesh (who plays on one song only).  I think that the listing of these folks as stars is disingenuous, and an obvious ploy to get Deadheads to part with their well-earned money.  Having said that, I think that Bob Weir does a great job with the songs he is involved with, especially ""Days Between,"" which he has really taken the time to make his own, despite the fact that it will always be a ""Jerry song.""  I also enjoyed the interviews and a number of the cover songs are well done by the folks involved.

Some nice jams, some nice versions, nothing earth shattering. If you seen Ratdog or many Dead cover bands you've heard it before. It is very well recorded and mixed though so it is very pleasant.

The reason to get this is for the interviews with Jerry's family and a good story from Bill Kreutzmann but that is maybe 15 to 20 minutes. Phil Lesh is seen briefly, Donna has a couple songs she does vocals and has a short interview, there is a segment praising Bobby near the end and the rest is decent, above average take of Jerry songs.

Brilliant music, great memories, and smiles aplenty. No mourning, just reminiscing. Knowing that we are not alone in our heartache makes it easier to remember him without missing him so much. ""Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile.""",1385596800,2,391,4.9393939393939394

5963634,5,B00F1W1SKI,"Excellent tribute to Jerry on what would have been his 70th birthday. Justin Kreutzmann, son of Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann, has done a spectacular job putting this video together. Many of the players do not come from the Jam Band scene like you would expect, but each and every one of them does a stellar job of bringing something to Jerry's music.

Ironically I had just watched The Last Waltz before this movie, and the cinematography is strikingly similar. That speaks volumes for this movie since The Last Waltz is widely regarded as one of if not the best concert movie of all time. The camera angles, catching the performers as they are getting into the groove, and largely ignoring the audience are all great techniques that were employed here.

Much thanks and credit must go to Bob Weir for creating this dream studio called TRI. It was designed for digital broadcasting and recording so it was ready from the get go. Bob was also the master mind behind this gathering and served as the musical guru for the performances. Thanks Bob!

You'll be glad you bought this for your collection and repeated watching pleasure... I sure am!",1384905600,28,1141,4.752525252525253
5963635,5,B00F1W1SKI,"I have to admit that Im not into the Grateful Dead as much as many of my friends but I always liked their classic hits. Ill leave to to get the expert opinion of some other reviewers but will try to give you some useful info on this Blu-ray disc. (IMPORTANT NOTE: Amazon groups all reviews of ALL formats of a video together. This is a review of the BD. Note on each review WHICH format the reviewer is commenting on.)

The concert is presented is HD and runs just over two hours. But you should know that it is not just music. There are interviews inserted throughout the program. The BONUS material includes another 6 songs (including Friend of The Devil, Tennessee Jed and Ship of Fools. which were not in the broadcast version. This alone, makes it a must for fans who saw the streamed version.

I hope this addition info and review was both informative and helpful.

5963637,5,B00F1W1SKI,"A terrific concert film, with many of my favorite Garcia/Hunter tunes.  Also a great assembly of indie musicians who came together to drink from the wellspring of Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead.  Members of Phish, Furthur, Black Crowes and others join in.  Outstanding musicianship and great engineering from TRI studios, which streamed the concert live. My only regret is that the disk didn't include ""Ripple"", which would have been appropriate; but there are many other favorites, all played well, and with heart.

Bob Weir led the concert, with Phil Lesh and Donna Jean Godchaux joining in.  Interviews with Bob Kreutzmann and Micky Hart rounded out the rest.  Justin Kreutzmann directed, and discussed his introduction to directing through discussions with Jerry while on tour with his father and the Dead, and the ideas that led to the Grateful Dead movie.

This is also a warm look at Jerry the person, with interviews with Carolyn (Mountain Girl) Garcia and individual interviews with their kids, short clips of Jerry, and lots of photos. Rounding it out is a poem, authored by David Crosby.

I bought the blue ray edition, which has absolutely perfect sound in both stereo and surround.
