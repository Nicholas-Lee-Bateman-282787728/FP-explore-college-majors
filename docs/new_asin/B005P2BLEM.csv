4856379,5,B005P2BLEM,"All I can say is.....wow!
This companion to the audio cd is a must have. While none of the artists that are heard singing are in the videos,it doesn't really matter. The message in each story is what really shines on this project,how God dealt with each one of them as an individual,beginning with Adam and Eve in the song ""Good"",after sinning against God the fallen couple ask ""...must each tomorrow hold,such brokenness untold?"" and finally ask at the end ""...will it ever be the way it was before?"",somehow feels as if it us asking these same questions. Some of the songs deserved better videos in my opinion,whether it was budget,artistic decisions etc. but a song as brilliant as ""I'm With You""(RUTH AND NAOMI)could have used better cinematography,they are still great to watch.
Every song and arrangement on this recording is brilliant and on most videos it works excellent;
""I Am(CREATION)
""Your Heart""(DAVID)
""Be Born in Me""(MARY)
""When Love Sees You""(JESUS)
The rest are not bad at all,they just don't hold up as well as the others. I am positive that this video disc will bless your life over and over.
Kudos to the artists who's vocals really bring out the mesaage in each song and Nichole Nordeman and Bernie Herms for putting together one of the best projects of the year with their brilliant songwriting.",1320364800,36,1318,4.836283185840708

4856394,5,B005P2BLEM,"I love music videos and I love God, so this is the perfect combination.  Some are better than others, of course, and a couple used old time Bible movie footage that distracted from the music for some reason, but overall, a lovely experience.  I especially liked the actor playing Jesus in many of the videos--finally a man that looks strong enough to be a carpenter, older than 30, not Hollywood handsome, and Middle Eastern in appearance.",1398902400,2,439,4.7631578947368425

4856420,1,B005P2BLEM,Unbelievably inspirational. The music is so powerful in lyric and melody.  The video quality and special effects are stellar.  The viewer is immediately drawn into each message of The Story.

The music and videos are amazing, and what a worshipful experience.  I only wish they would go on tour again this year.  Now that I know the songs and have seen the videos (which they played during the production) I can only imagine how the worship would be. I just watch the video, sing, praise, worship and am in AWE at the word of God.  Thank you God for using Nicole and her husband in such a powerful way through the words and the lyrics.

4856432,5,B005P2BLEM,"I ran across one of these on YouTube and was amazed at the high quality of the video, the exceptional lyric content, and the careful attention to the biblical narrative. Thanks for those who contributed to this marvelous compilation. I sat down and watched the whole thing through and was deeply moved. I could see this as a great tool to share the biblical story of redemption to someone who loves contemporary music.",1334102400,,418,4.739726027397261
4856433,2,B005P2BLEM,"I heard so much about this being shown LIVE and so I wanted the DVD and I was so excited to buy it and watch it...but although brand new and still in the case with no scratches, towards the middle of the DVD, it was acting like it was already scratched.  It kept freezing and breaking in between......  So sad.....due to that I missed a few of the songs and videos and did not get the opportunity to enjoy all of ""The Story"".",1331596800,,425,4.108433734939759
4856434,4,B005P2BLEM,"Music from The Story features many excellent music videos that beautifully illustrate the the Bible's message of transformation and redemption. The dramatic footage used in many of the videos is very well done.

4856436,5,B005P2BLEM,I was moved by the music - each song told in the first person was powerful. It brought every story and every person to life and reality,1323648000,,135,4.037037037037037
4856437,5,B005P2BLEM,"I found The Story to be absolutely outstanding!  Nicole Nordeman, together with the top CC artists of this decade have created the best CD/DVD in the history, yes history, of Contemporary Christian music.  The only negative is you have to buy each separately.  But non CC music fans, don't avoid this compilation of original new release music because it is ""Religious"" or ""Christian"".  Musically it has several songs that no doubt deserve a cross over from the Christian label to the top songs in today's alternative music categories.  Peter Furler's No Compromise, sounds like it would fit as a cover for a Linkin Park cut, Brandon Heath's Bend has a Nickelback sound,  Dan Haseltine's  Empty Tomb has a solid ColdPlay sound,  Bart Millard's story of Moses has a U2 touch, and the song Joshua has an Evanesence sound that is closed out with an Eminem flavor at the end from LeCrae.  Amy Grant, Mandisa and Michael W. Smith have already earned their positions in the music world and for the in-the-know CC group all will be very pleased with what Nicole has produced with Chris Tomlin (also with a Linkin Park type song), Jeremy Camp and Matthew West to name a few on this release.

 For a 2011 Christmas gift to your fellow church goer or family member it is a definite winner.  To the friend who is open to an alternative look at the realities of the Bible and the characters lives brought to heart, it is well worth a gift they will appreciate. For the music aficionado, you will wonder what else you have missed, as I too was unaware, when hearing the talent and sound heard on this compilation.

Oh yeah, this is a DVD, almost forgot.  This is a full story set, aka ""concept album"" along the lines of The Wall and Tommy, but a much deeper storyline, so yes it will be mixed with some mellow starts and stops.  But unlike the typical 'music dvd' it has a full flow from beginning to end, and amazingly there are no live artist clips.  Why not I asked?  Well, it is The Stories of real people in the Bible from Adam & Eve to the very ending of Jesus' Disciples.  It depicts the affect God had on real people's lives. Their real struggles in life and the climatic, dramatic, and graphic (I think original filming, not positive) portrayal of what He did for all of those in The Story.  No need to bring the artists faces in.  It also reveals the heart of those willing to contribute to this epic release.  It is written and produced to open eyes, ears, and hearts.  Pick it up and give it a chance to affect your life and others you care for.",1323561600,4,2543,4.458874458874459
4856438,5,B005P2BLEM,"We saw the second of 18 dates for the live show of The Story.  It was a powerful, moving and innovative presentation of the Bible, and the DVD carries the water as well. Each song tells the story of one character in the Bible.  The music is terrific and the lyrics contain thoughtful perspective and nice detail. Each video also features a different style of graphics, including nature shots, drawings, old-time silent, sand art (our consensus family favorite) and footage from dramatic documentary The Story of Jesus. The songs are sung by a who's who of contemporary Christian pop artists. This DVD is meaningful inspiration for experienced Christians and a terrific introduction to the Bible for those new to the faith or wanting to learn more. Either way, The Story gets two thumbs up.

One tip: turn on the subtitles when you watch so you catch the full meaning.",1323043200,,867,4.805369127516778

Based on seeing the video for one of the songs, I purchased the DVD assuming that all songs would have similarly produced videos to accompany them but not so. Most of them use very basic images and editing for the songs and in my opinion, it was not worth my money although I would highly recommend buying the CD!
