8221343,4,6303829821,"This is a very good movie from Mexico's golden era. I have never found it on DVD. Features all songs by Jose Alfredo being sung by many stars Antonio Aguilar, Luis Aguilar, Javier Solis, Flor Silvestre, as twins,& Jose Alfredo Jimenez to name a few. The songs are all classics and Sara Garcia is excellent as always. This is one of my favorite movies for the songs and simple comedic fun. I recommend it to any fan of Jose Alfredo's music.",1331164800,,439,4.432098765432099
