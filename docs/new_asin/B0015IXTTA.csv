8258748,2,B0015IXTTA,"Yeah yeah I know, some of these guys are legends. I mean Deep Purple are here, Clapton and Joe Walsh too. Rainbow gets a nod (hey, Classic Rock put this on the cover of issue 104 - they are obsessed with the 70's and so of course Blackmore would be here somewhere), there is also Steve Hackett and Rory Gallagher (ditto my comment about Rainbow). A few different things are here, Black Label Society and Toto are probably at different ends of the spectrum and that breaks things up a bit. The Black Crowes are present and accounted for, after all they are the critics darlings.... funny thing is that the public never seemed so enthused past album #1 - which is the album the critics don't go on about so much.

All up this release was given out for free, so don't pay too much for it. There is some useful stuff here and importantly the disc is multi zone - it'll play NTSC and PAL and that's a bonus. No life changing things here and I only ever managed to watch it once.",1224547200,,973,4.2594594594594595
8258749,3,B0015IXTTA,"This DVD came free with an issue of Classic Rock, a UK rock music magazine. It's a nice DVD, but someone is trying to make a quick buck selling something they received for free.
For the record, the Deep Purple track is from the Morse-era, so you're not getting two Blackmore performances on this disc. The Rainbow track is from the Rockpalast show, so if you have that one already you've been warned.
The guitar performances range from mediocre to smokin', with the performances you'd expect from the greats being the best.",1223251200,,523,4.695652173913044
