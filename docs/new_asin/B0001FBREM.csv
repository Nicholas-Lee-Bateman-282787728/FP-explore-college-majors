8011618,5,B0001FBREM,"Out of a requirement to support our foster kids' heritage, I purchased this video. I found it very difficult to find anything at the library  that is appropriate and interesting enough for our kids. We have four kids from 4 year to 13 years so, we needed something that could appeal to everyone. I put the video on in our car not knowing what to expect and of course I was not able to see the video myself. To my surprise, all the kids became very quiet and engrossed in the video. I listened along to the stories and also found them rather entertaining. I would recommend this video to anyone either for the purpose of learning more about Native Americans or simply for the entertainment of these fun, fictional, stories.",1388793600,4,722,4.511450381679389
8011619,5,B0001FBREM,"As a middle school teacher in the Southeast, I use this to show my students, many of whom have Cherokee roots, that the Greeks and Romans aren't the only ones with a rich tradition.  My students love it and so do I, especially the story of Little Turtle! This is a great resource for anyone who would like to highlight the Native American tales.",1373155200,5,345,4.390625
