The (then) new material from ""Shadows in the Air"" holds up equal or better than the Cream standards. Vernon Reid does overplay a bit in the early part of the set, but from ""59th street"" on he is on fire, laying down perfect leads that make even the old songs fresh and new. Bernie Worrell adds some amazing Hammond color in all the right places. If I had to choose between this DVD and the Cream reunion DVD to take to a desert island, I would choose this one.  Though I like that one too!",1239062400,,610,4.083333333333333
7989121,2,B000094FE6,"Poor mixing somes up this otherwise good DVD. I was curious if Vernon Reid was actually turned on at one stage. Yes I know it was Jack Bruce's gig, but hey don't all the musicians deserve some recognition. Vernon was cooking, it was a shame though I couldn't hear him. This guy rocks.

If you want some live Jack Bruce material, get the Birthday Concert on CD. Well recommended.",1146614400,,378,4.478260869565218
7989122,3,B000094FE6,"Vernon Reid is my problem with this otherwise very good CD. His solos are completely unsympathetic to the material. The rest of the band is very good, but the combination of drummers is not as effective as one strong drummer. There isn't a lot of space left.

The DVD of Jack Bruce and Friends is more effective and if you don't own it, start there. I really do wish someone would release the Birthday Party concert footage as the CDs for that are great. The recent Cream DVD is superior.

I don't think this is a horrible DVD at all, and a good addition to your Jack Bruce collection. It just isn't my favorite DVD of Jack's.",1141344000,5,626,4.3418803418803416
