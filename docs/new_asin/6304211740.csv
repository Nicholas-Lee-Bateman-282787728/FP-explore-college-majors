William Hurt isn't Brooding/ Sardonic at all and the Atmospheric and Dramatic aspects are Lacking. Film feels Rushed and no On -Screen Chemistry from Jane and Mr. Rochester.

812745,4,6304211740,"This movie was an act of love on Zeffirelli's part.  It's a stunningly beautiful adaptation of Charlottes work. The settings are breathtaking, the score is outstanding, and the color palettet is wonderful. It is a rich and pleasing movie. Joan Plowright makes a wonderful Mrs. Fairfax, very close to the books version. I collect Jane Eyre movies, and this is my favorite JE to watch when I want a condensed version. Many say Hurt is sleepwalking though it, but I liked his interpretation of Rochester. I knew I would when I saw how  the scene where they meet was handled. It is true to the book with little shouting, not like some  other versions.  Also, there are scenes where the dialog from the book occurs in a new setting or is mixed around, I thought the choices were good. Added dialog fits in well.  I also like the ending where Jane talks of Rochester as a tree that plants will wind around because they find him so safe a hold. This is condensed from the book and this adaptation is one of few to include this wonderful line. Disappointing was the shortened stay with me scene. That scene is so core to the story.  Jane really stands up to her convictions here and I wish they had expanded it more. Jane is a bit more reserved than I like but Charlotte is able to show loves true transformation in her eyes. Wonderful stuff. The costumes were very good and added to the overall fine features of this movie.  It is a treat to have a movie when the director, screenwriter, and cast want to do their best to honor this great piece of literature. That honor and care is evident through the whole movie.",1462924800,2,1608,4.448979591836735

812750,5,6304211740,"This is the best JANE EYRE that ever made. But it's more then that. It's Franco Zeffirelli's one of the best movie too.
 I never had doubt that Franco Zeffirelli is a great director. His other movies like <Hamlet><Endless Love><Romeo & Juliet> are all masterpiece.
 He really understands classic tales and using great music as background sound to boost up his movie as wel.. Not only working with great musician with Ennio Morricone but also other musicions as well.
 In this movie, he works even better with Claudio Capponi and Alessio Vlad. They are making each important moment of the film so great that when the moment comes, I can feel my heart beating so loud.
 I knew that Charlotte Gainsbourg was a beautiful actress but she was more then that in this film. She was dazzling. She was fragile, shinning star, sometimes a rebel, sometimes a love seeker, unpredicable little creature that we cannot hate. With her hair mended and beautiful dress on, she was simply an angel that I want to hug her and just crash into pieces.
 William on the other hand was a poor beast who seeks for love, touch, who can understand and sustain his pain and anger. He lost his woman -not lost but she is mentally ill in his house and she is out of her mind. That is, she is there but doesn't exist- and constantly travels with his daughter in his gigantic house alone.
 When his wife finally dies in fire, and the love finally fulfilles, with the beautiful music coming out from the screen, we just can't put our eyes off the movie. We feel relieved, happy, just gaze at the title rolling till it says the movie is really over.
 It is an instand classic, a masterpiece that you should never skip.
 Now this is what we call a true love story. Whatch it or you are missing the greatest film ever made based on a great novel.
 Don't see other Jane Eyre which messed up the fine novel. This is 1996 version.",1457049600,,1890,4.47093023255814

Yes, huge liberties were taken with the story and that did bother me, but I really didn't like the part of the story when she was away from the mansion anyway.

There are two scenes that I could watch over and over.  The first is where they declare their love, and the last scene of the movie. My only problem with the film is that there is next to nothing that really shows the building of their love story other than a few hand holding and stares into each other's eyes.",1444694400,,482,4.239130434782608

This is not true to Ms. Bronte' s book by any means. I would give it 0 stars if I was given that option. The book is truly a passionate story full of soul crushing hurt. Toby Stephens did a much better job of displaying who Rochester was, and that version omitted alot. Also,  the actress who played Jane gave a much better description of Jane . This version is way past horrid. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Better yet, those dipwads who gave this a 4-5 star rating...READ THE BOOK. Then you'll see why this version is complete garbage. Whoever put out this crap, should be publicly horsewhipped for the deliberate butchering of an awesome story and classic.

Having said that, I have long been in love with the 80's Dalton-Rochester because there was some feeling of truth behind the relationship that developed between the main characters.
This one feels much more fluid. Much more believable. Rochester seems much more developed. Toby has done a great job of bringing Rochester to life and Jane is wonderful in this.
Even though I can only watch it on my laptop, I LOVE watching it. It's better than paying $90.00 than some other amazon sellers are asking.

When a filmmaker or anyone significantly revises a story penned by another but continues to identify that story as the original author's work, it's a crime in my opinion. They should have the decency to make the reader/viewer aware of their modifications.
I've run into this deception before with Andrew Davies' modifications of Charles Dickens'  ""Little Dorrit"" and ""Bleak House,"" and I've read that many prefer his versions (though I wonder if they've actually read the Dickens book{s}). Okay, fine, but let the modifier have the decency to identify them self as author, who's based his/her story on another's work.",1420156800,,654,5.169811320754717

813496,2,6304211740,"This is not a book that adapts well to a two hour film. I've seen just about every iteration of Jane Eyre that have ever been made and the only ones that stand up well are those that are treated as a two-partner or mini-series.

I totally understand that books and film are two different mediums.  And I realize that parts of Bronte's book are unfilmable (The gypsy fortune telling scene springs to mind)  But in an effort to condense the story to two hours, too much is lost in this version.  Jane and Rochester are in love just because we're told so. We never really see it develop, we never understand why.  In fairness, I will say that one thing they added that I do approve of is we see the softening of Mr. Rochester's heart towards Adele.  I always thought this relationship was never fully explored in the book properly -- perhaps because Bronte was already pushing it by implying that Rochester is Adele's father.

There's some chemistry between the leads, not a lot, but what little there is doesn't really develop properly because of the rushed pacing.  As far at the acting goes, it's amusing that Charlotte speaks with a French accent (not unusual as she was raised in France and French is her first language!).  And of course, American actor William Hurt speaks with an American accent, being born in America and all.  But they both give it a go and sort of work as a couple ultimately.  Joan Ploughwright is excellent, as always.

But it's the last third of the film where it all really falls apart in a rush to finish the story up.  Strangely, Jane returns to Gateshead, the place of her terrible childhood.  This makes no sense for the character, none.  I realize this is probably because the screenwriters didn't like the coincidence that Bronte came up with, or perhaps they didn't like the foolish decisions that Jane make in her grief (but wasn't that the point?  Everyone in this story makes foolish decisions, but they learn from them.)  But Bronte's choices are far more palatable than the idea that Jane would actually go back to the place where she was abused as a child, the one place above all that she felt threatened and hated.  There really wasn't even much point to having St. John in the story because he had no actual storyline here.  Which is another odd choice, because its his own failed love story that makes Jane realize she must be braver, that a life in hiding is not worth living.

It's not the worst adaptation I've ever seen (that dubious honor belongs to the more recent Michael Fassbender/Mia Wasikowska version.  If the chemistry here is a only 4 out of 10, that one is actually in the negative numbers!)  But it gives short shrift because of the time constraints and therefore it's not the experience it could be.",1409356800,2,2761,4.580448065173116

It is her back ground against the privileged yet unfortunate background (we don't know up front, but it unfolds) of Mr. Rochester that makes the interaction between them interesting.

The left out whole scenes and characters (seems like at least a third of the book was left out), added new scenes that weren't in the book, rearranged some of the scenes,and totally ruined it. The first five-ten minutes are fine, but after that, the whole movie changes.  The movie doesn't represent the book at all.  I love the book, and have read it, and listened to it on CD many many times, and thought I'd enjoy seeing it on screen.  Man, was I wrong.  There is no chemistry between Jane and Rochester.  You can't even tell he's falling in love with her, or her with him, until the scene where he proposes.  They ruin the fact that she ran away, and was found my relatives she didn't know she had.  They take out the whole part of her living at Moorshead, and becoming a teacher.  They end it just as abruptly.  UG.  Horrible.  Do not watch.",1398470400,3,888,4.315151515151515

I know it's a long story but if you're going to commit to a classic like Jane Eyre,you need to tell the story right.

Great acting, casting, character development, and following the original novel.  I did not like the newest version at all with Michael Fassbender.  I feel character development was very weak by both actors and directors.  When I thought that one was the worst, I then saw this one and now I think this is the worst of these two.  Much of the original story was changed, rearranged or missing. Important parts were missing, the actors were stale, and characters  were not developed well so I found them unacceptable.

I am not a Hurt fan. He seems the same to me in every movie; however, he shines in this role. He gave Rochester the perfect blend of anger, human, frail, caring, and desperate. You could easily see the growing admiration and love between the two main characters. ""Jane"" was sufficiently young and naive to see the huge disparity in their natures, stations in life, and experience. It made the love story all the more romantic. In this version the house, the moors, and the entire story isn't as dark as they are in some others. I think that is a plus. The Brontes sure know how to depress!

She is both genuinely self-assured and entirely vulnerable at once. Naive yet highly evolved, unassuming though precisely empathetic, humble as a nun and as intimidating as a lioness. She personifies desirability and intrigue in a woman by way of a revelation - that pure plainness can be more boundless in it's allure, and more engagingly, utterly sexy -- than ever it is unremarkable. Efforts by other talented actresses are appreciated, but they lie in a heap of inconsequence. See for yourself as you are drawn into this chemistry  again and again.

Rather than run away alone, as occurs in the book, Jane returns to Gateshead where she meets with St. John Rivers and his sisters.

Jane Eyre also grew on me over the years. As I aged I gained an appreciation for the emotion and depth of the story, all the turns and pitfalls, the love for the characters. And who doesn't love a happy ending?

So as I've perused through the many different film adaptations I've always felt something wanting. They never really captured the raw emotion of the book as well as the 2011 Focus Feature's version I watched tonight. I loved the way the story transitioned and the actors who played the parts.

814028,5,6304211740,"Franco Zeffirelli  brings an Italian flair to a British tale, with  French and American actors playing the leads, supported by a mainly British cast (along with Aussies).  It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film.  Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the-top expression of emotion; except perhaps for the music which
  brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad).  The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective.  It's a gothic tale, so the ""shadows are as important as the light"".  Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an ""india rubber ball.""  He sees  Jane as having a ""strange unearthly beauty"" .  He quizzes her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks her if that head on her shoulders has"" more of the same kind of furniture within?""  Jane must subdue her emotions because she is ""his hired servant"".
  Well, you get the idea as the film shows Jane's austere character.  I cannot criticize Zeffirelli for bringing the later parts of the novel to a compact finale. It strays cinematically to bring the film to a  compressed but satisfying conclusion.  And so, readers, ""I married him"" she announces,  but is it to the  flawed and
broken Edward Rochester or the handsome god-like St. John Rivers?  Zeffirelli frames his last shot on the pastoral scene.",1368489600,2,1342,4.981900452488688

Something that was integral to the book, which I have never seen in any film adaptation, was missing: religion, and the idea that God rewards those who live in obedience to Him.

814241,4,6304211740,"The story of Jane Eyre is classic, the tale of a young girl harassed by relatives, sent away to a harsh boarding school but manages to retain her sense of spirit, identity and independence as she grows up, is both harrowing but uplifting. Jane is not bitter about her circumstances. She is wise enough, even from a young age, to understand how things work and not embittered as a result. She grows up strong and fine, emotionally muted but not without her hopes and dreams. In Mr. Rochester, tempestuous, frustrated and trapped, does she find all that she's been seeking, and in Jane, does Mr. Rochester may truly find solace, but in the end, to heart breaking results.

Jane Eyre is one of my all time favorite novels and the various adaptations have always left me wanting. The most recent, and modern, version,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/B0053Q9DHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre</a>, from 2011 was an interesting albeit stilted addition to the Jane Eyre Movie Oeuvre but then I came across this older version, which delighted me. This version has the feel and restrained emotion that is present in the book. Of yearning and that touch and go between Jane and Edward that was so palpable and tangible though always slightly removed, as though Bronte wanted us to be close, on bated breath, but not too close. The 2011 version has that same sustained angst and yearning, its telling is still very choppy but the interplay between Wasikowska and Fassbender is riveting. The trick, becomes, how to play two desperate beings as one and every adaptation has its own interpretation and that's what's fascinating.

I've seen other versions:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/B000784WMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre</a>&nbsp;(1983, 11-episodes!), which was very low budget, almost theater-like but the mood/tone of the book is present, the 1997&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/0767020294/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre</a>&nbsp;version with Ciaran Hinds and disliked by most, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Theatre-Jane-Eyre/dp/B000LPQ6DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre</a>&nbsp;(2006) version that had more misses than hits and deviated too much from the book, while the 2011 version was more flash than content, too short and not as satisfying, though none are by any means insufficient. I enjoyed all the versions and all had their flaws and wonderful moments. For some reason, I've always passed on this version. Mainly because I didn't envision William Hurt as the ideal Mr. Rochester, nor Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane.

However, Hurt was controlled and perfectly on pitch, both explosive when needed and quietly aching when appropriate, though granted, not the Rochester usually so fiercely depicted. Gainsbourg was quite good, elegant and graceful, ethereal and haunting, yet ever so present but most importantly, exactly precise in her rendering of Jane, maintaining that poise and subdued emotions on the brink of erupting. Some while find this version too restrained and subdued, that the chemistry between Hurt and Gainsbourg is lacking. I didn't mind that interpretation and I loved the interplay between Hurt and Gainsbourg, who used their bodies and facial expressions to convey their feelings for one another. In the book, there is this sense that, from Bronte, the relationship and intimacy of Rochester and Jane is entirely their own, that the audience doesn't ever truly participate but watch from afar, as pure observers. In this version, the director does exactly that and it's so much more powerful. It's not too much acting or costuming or production though the editing was a bit pitchy at parts. Ultimately, this is a movie that needs to be watched a few times to really appreciate the actors portrayals of Jane and Mr. Rochestor, not just the primary ones but the secondary cast that brought more credibility to the overall feel and presentation of the story.

I think it would be very difficult for another actress to claim a better performance of Jane. The photography and music put you in the story immediately and they leave a deep impression.

814436,5,6304211740,"In this 1996 version; Jane is not charming because at a young age her hateful aunt slandered her, and sent her to an orphanage, where she was raised by a headmaster who also slandered her and was mean to her.

Jane grows up and becomes a governess; a live-in tutor for a little girl. Jane is not glamorous. However, the girl's widower, father notices Jane's goodness.

The film holds your attention. Filmed on location. Nice sets and costumes. The relationships are believable. This version moves at a better pace than other versions.

The 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson is a good version too. Its slow pace is redeemed by some excellent scenes. In the 2007 version; Jane has some charm and personality. Both Jane and Rochester are likeable. Women viewers will love the romance of the Masterpiece Theatre version.

The 1944 black & white version begins promising during Jane's childhood, because the headmaster is a true villain and Jane wins our sympathy. However, Jane's childhood is a brief part of the film. The main story of Jane's adult life centers on her relationship with Rochester. Orson Welles' Rochester is so harsh and unlikeable without any redeeming qualities that it is not believable Jane would like him. Rochester's house may be historically accurate, but it is so dark and dreary, with no daytime scenes of light to give any hope, that viewers are overwhelmed with depression.

The 1-star reviews of this 1996 version are all by people who have read the book. If you have not read the book; you will like this. Two people can read the same book and imagine very different characters. A reader with a vivid imagination will always imagine something better than any movie can reproduce. What this movie does; it does well. There is more of the story to be told in future versions. The 1996 version is a heartwarming film. It is a story about a plain girl who develops qualities a man can love.",1341705600,3,1929,4.7807807807807805
814437,5,6304211740,"Franco does not lie to himself in this screenplay. To adapt so rich a novel in under 2 hours is, of course, absurd. There are many versions in film of this story and, obviously, as many interpretations. Each, because they are adaptations, invariably become something quite independent of the novel. This version is no exception. However, this version doesn't so much ""take liberties"" with the story as it does retell it in a unique manner. Here, the focus is much more heavily placed on the tormented love of the two primary characters. Although William Hurt always appears stiff in scenes of embracing, he none the less delivers a fine performance. The casting for young Adele is sweet and very endearing. As for Mrs. Fairfax, one would have to search far and wide to find an individual who does not adore the talented and seasoned performance of Joan Plowright. Finally we are left to the performance of Ms. Gainsbourg as Jane. I have noted that if you are already a Charlotte Gainsbourg fan, you will like her in anything she does. This movie is no exception. Although even more subdued than Bronte's novel character, Gainsbourg delivers.

814439,2,6304211740,"Wow - this was the blandest version of Jane Eyre I have ever seen. After watching Jane Eyre with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson this was a complete and total let down.

Let's start with the performances.  William Hurt was just so awful - his portrayal was downright creepy.  The scene where he is declaring his love for Jane he is sitting down not even bothering to look at her. I could barely stand to watch him with his head down and his eyes looking up - he looked so grotesque.  No passion, no power - Frankenstein could have brought more fire to the role.

Charlotte Gainsborough couldn't be bothered to put any inflection into her voice- no passion - no emotion - nothing.  She was - sorry there is no other word but - ""blah"" to accurately describe her.  Jane is all about passion but Charlotte's performance lacked anything that remotely resembled emotion.  You don't get so much as a smirk on her face at any given time.

I didn't even like the two of them as a couple - I saw no discernable electricity or chemistry or fire probably because they were both decided to play their parts so flat and lifeless.

To top it all off they took some liberties with the plot probably in the interest of brevity.  I can handle this but their choices to do this were odd.  For instance: they cut out one sister of St John (not sure why - she wouldn't have taken up any extra time) Jane arrives back at Gateshead for a 2nd time???  She first meets St John at Gateshead?  All of it untrue and perplexing - why change these things?

First Jane is not supposed to be boring. Charlotte Gainsbourg never has any emotion on her face. She never smiles or shows that she is happy. That is not what Jane Eyre is like. She is supposed to show emotions, but Charlotte Gainsbourg does't. Don't even get me started on William Hurt as Mr. Rochester.
William Hurt is not the one who should've played Mr. Rochester. Also Charlotte Gainsbourg was not the one to play Jane either. But back to William Hurt. He should've had more emotion as well!! He was supposed to fall in love with jane slowly, but he didn't. One minute he didn't like her, then the next he was head over heels. There was just not enough story between him and Jane.
This version just is not the one to watch. It isn't. If you are a Jane Eyre fan, a big Jane Eyre fan, then do not purchase this one.",1324252800,6,993,4.344086021505376

In many moments, I didn't feel the passion/tension that define the character. Gainsbourg was ok, but she lacked the passion too, especially in the scene where she speaks all her feelings when she knows she has to leave Thornfield Hall.  The couple lacked chemistry, and what is more frustrating are the liberties the producers took while filming.  So much of the book has been left out, and worse, changed.  The Rivers didn't know who was Jane Eyre when they first met.  Futhermore, leaving no adequate description of the life changing encounter with the Rivers is just sinful.

Of course Joan Plowright ""is"" Mrs. Fairfax personified.  Adele is the right size and acts like Adele should. She is charming.

814540,1,6304211740,"You don't have to be a Jane Eyre fan to know that the casting of this adaptation is all wrong.
It begins with Anna Paquin, one of the worst actresses in recent memory, as young Jane. While she's not as abominable as she is in later roles, she doesn't start the show off with anything that would make you care about Jane.

While Charlotte Gainsbourge is a tolerable Jane, she's so sappy and spaced-out that it's fairly hard to empathize with her if you don't know the real Jane already.

And then comes William Hurt. Why anyone would cast a man with the emotive range of a cactus to play the dynamic, volatile Mr. Rochester is a mystery. He dribbles out the classic lines like a child who hasn't learned to control its drooling. I don't know how anyone could believe that a brilliant, passionate, and tortured mind could lay behind that deadpan face and dry-as-dust voice. The character should exude energy and brilliance through every move and gesture. I don't know if I can blame Gainsbourge for her flat portrayal of Jane when she had absolutely nothing to play off of.

My one complaint is not about the movie, it is about the quality of the DVD. I ordered, then returned and reordered it because at one particular point on the disc (the same place on each DVD)it ""freezes"" and can not be made to proceed without skipping ahead to the next section. I then have to reverse back to almost the point where the freeze up occurs, then I press ""Play"" again and continue on with the movie. This is most annoying. I have chosen to keep the second copy I got in the belief that returning it and replacing it with a third is unlikely to make a bit of difference.

This one is at the bottom of the heap. There are a few problems, but the most glaring is that William Hurt is profoundly miscast as Rochester. Hurt is a great actor, but his cerebral, detached style is inappropriate for the role of a virile, passionate, angry Byronic hero.

He also appears stiff and cold because he is not supposed to love the governess nor any woman for that matter. Rochester is deeply in love with a woman he can't have but loves her anyway and so he tortures her in his own way to push her to love him as well.  Jane is slim and young because she is slim and young in the book.  She has eaten very little in years and was always unloved and unwanted.  Jane Eyre is truly a wonderful story, I definitely would recommend this movie.  It would be great if Amazon would carry some of the newer versions as well.",1297123200,3,781,4.214765100671141

First of all, the girl who played Jane was timid and too young looking. My husband called her fragile and feared for her throughout the movie. Nothing like the book, where she is strong hearted and willed. She also looks about 14 and sticks her lips out like she wears braces... very distracting. The guy who plays Mr. Roschester only did slightly better. His acting was more spot on, but he obviously felt very little for his opposite and there were no sparks whatsoever. In fact the way they played off of each other it was just as much a surprise to my husband (who hasn't read the book) as it was to Miss Fairfax that they fell in love. Which brings me to Miss Fairfax, who was the only character worth watching. She fully became Mrs. Fairfax with her kindness and discretion. In fact her portrayal made me realize new things about her in the book that I hadn't noticed before. I don't want to blame it all on the actors... The screen writing/ directing was heartless and quick too. It sped through things with little emotion. I hope to find a better version.",1295481600,6,1197,4.470319634703197

814691,5,6304211740,"This movie tells the story of Jane Eyre beautifully; if not perfectly word-for-word matched to the book, it communicates the classic story in a manner that is both true, effective, and beautiful.  Bronte's story was one filled with pain and suffering, balanced by unspeakable joy and love; this film captures that (if I may be so bold as to speak for a world-class author who lived some two hundred years ago) just as she would have liked.  Gainsbourg portrays Jane Eyre with brilliancy: the gentle and compassionate schoolteacher/governess is harmonious with the passionate spirit, honest tongue, and fierce determination that Charlotte Bronte so masterfully implanted into her unusual heroine.
A word of caution to those who may prefer action movies and plots that rush along at ten thousand miles per hour:  This is a thought-provoking film and an intriguing mystery, and while there is a touch of the thrilling, it is NOT an action movie, and there are no swords. Sorry :(

814815,2,6304211740,"It is difficult for any true fan of a classic novel to love a movie version which truncates and/or reimagines the events of the story. But it can be done. ""Anne of Green Gables"" is one good example, as is the new Disney version of ""Prince Caspian"" (for me, anyway). This movie version of ""Jane Eyre,"" however, is not one of those remarkable films. As per most adaptations of the novel they chose to focus on the love story and left out the rest of Jane's adventures. I understand this was necessary in order to keep the film to regular feature length. But since the love story was the main focus you would think they would work hard to make it truly believable. Unfortunately it came off as completely incomprehensible. The problem? The flat performance of the actress playing Jane. No, she's not supposed to be pretty, and yes, she's supposed to be demure and quiet. But lifeless? Hardly. What makes Jane Eyre a beloved heroine of classic literature is her lively mind and how she unapologetically reveals it to those who take the time to look beyond her calm and proper exterior. The moments in the book where Mr. Rochester catches glimpses of the true Jane are what make their love story believable. This movie skips most of those moments, and when they do briefly show one, the scene is rendered ineffective by the flat, lifeless delivery of the actress. There is no spark of vivacity in her eyes, no indication that her words emanate from a deep well of emotion and intellect. Why would the Mr. Rochester of the movie have even the remotest interest in this Jane? I give the filmmakers props for taking on such a project and hoping to interest a new generation in this great story. But their rendering of ""Jane Eyre"" didn't even make an entertaining film in its own right, much less hint at the thrill of reading the full novel.",1264291200,5,1833,4.574468085106383

814911,2,6304211740,"This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it. So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel, the three short versions of '44, '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73, '83 and 2006, and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters.

This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned. Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky, of lonely Rochester standing on a rock, and of Jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life. In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester, and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse. There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane, each of them beautifully staged, but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other. We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences. Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Bront's superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out. What remains is just a glimpse of the novel, which does no justice to Charlotte Bront's masterpiece.

The cast is a mixed bag: While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed, Anna Paquin's young Jane is more an ill-mannered, pout Lolita than a lonely little girl, longing for love. The ever-reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable, but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix, and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking, hard-working Grace Poole. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine, however, is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre. Looking every bit like 18, thin and frail, with irregular, strong features, she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role. And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance. Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask. But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane's character any further. As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues, Gainsbourgh's portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. This is a pity, as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the '83 version.

But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane, there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays. Hurt, who has proven himself to be a fine actor in many good movies, must have been aware that he was physically and type-wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel. His Rochester, besides being blond and blue-eyed, is a soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy and quiet, slightly queer and eccentric, but basically good-natured and mild. He is so far from being irascible, moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, during many moments of the movie, Hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness. Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open. If you compare his Rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel, simply bursting with energy and temperament, it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt's performance. Still, he offends me less than the Rochesters in the '70, '97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones. Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so, whereas George C. Scott, Ciarn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could, but failed miserably, and I'd rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played. And I'd rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a Starbucks caf. Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure, but at least it is an inoffensive one, which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations. I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation: You will not find Jane Eyre, but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.",1231632000,7,5632,4.792181069958848

I am very disappointed with this version of the film (Hurt & Gainesbourg), so much so that I have not yet tried to watch any of the others.  Having read the book so near to the time that I watched the film, I was aghast that so much of the story was ignored!  Jane's time spent between leaving Thornfield and going back to Mr. Rochester was COMPLETELY skipped over.  Much of her childhood was likewise left out.  The cruelty that Jane experienced at the hands of her aunt and cousins was only briefly touched upon, and hardly any attention was given to the relationships she cultivated at Lowood School.  Perhaps most diappointing, the relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester was hardly developed at all.  There were no moments when the viewer felt an unspoken yearning or tension between them that would foreshadow their union.  There was simply nothing going on between the two characters that would hint at love or interest in each other, making the proposal scene (a very beautiful scene in the book!) very, very lackluster.  Furthermore, the actors, in my opinion, did not truly portray the characters as they were written.  While young Anna Paquin is quite talented, I don't feel that she gave the best portrayal of young Jane (this is probably the fault of those who counseled the actress), because she portrayed Jane as insolent, sullen, and mouthy.  The child Jane in the book is none of those things.  Charlotte Gainesbourg gave a fair performance as the adult Jane.  But, as much as I admire William Hurt's performances in his countless other roles, he was simply NOT Mr. Rochester.  Hurt displayed none of the dark brooding and sharp wit that the Mr. Rochester in the book displayed.  This adaptation is very disappointing, and I would urge those who love the story to choose another means in which to waste 2 hours.",1228262400,16,1971,4.789940828402367

I enjoyed the adaptation until halfway into the movie. Then everything went horribly wrong - Jane leaves right after the failed wedding to go to Gateshead? The Rivers family (minus one sister, I forget if it's Diana or Mary) live at Gateshead? She met St. John when her Aunt Reed died? Why take huge liberties with the storyline that are completely untrue to the story? I'm not a Jane Eyre purist, but the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg version was just as awful as the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version.

Bottom line:

1) If you've never read Jane Eyre, I would NOT recommend seeing this version before you read the book. Actually I wouldn't recommend this version on any level.

2) If you've never seen a film/TV adaptation of Jane Eyre, I'd recommend starting with the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version first and move on to the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version afterward. The TD/ZC version is 6 hours and does a fantastic job of keeping the integrity of the novel in tact. The TS/RW is 4 hours, takes a few liberties with the novel, but the two leads' performances are absolutely electric and this version is very well done. Enjoy!",1224288000,46,1356,4.733050847457627

I don't expect a film based on Jane Eyre to be totally true to the book (although, the Timothy Dalton version comes the closest) but I do expect it to at least tell, basically, the same story.  This film does not even come close.

Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) has one expression which never changes throughout the entire movie.  William Hurt is not appealing, in any way, and seems like he decides to marry Jane because he has nothing better to do!  In fact, in the scene in the church, where it is discovered that Mr. Rochester already has a wife, he leaves Jane standing there and takes off for home without a backward glance. But that's ok because she doesn't seem to care either way!

There is absolutely no connection between these two supposedly ""star struck"" lovers.  They both seem like they couldn't care less what happens.  Frankly, the viewer doesn't either.  I found it hard to sit through at all.  I kept waiting for something to happen that would draw me in and it never did.

Most of the interesting scenes in the book were totally cut out--not even a hint.  Instead of Jane discovering that she has family that she didn't know about (St. John Rivers and his sisters) they incorporated St. John into a sort of goofy parson on Jane's dead uncle's estate. Why bother with him at all?

If you have read Jane Eyre, you will be shocked that this movie even has the same name as the book.  If you haven't read Jane Eyre and are looking for romantic entertainment (or any entertainment for that matter) don't buy this movie.

If you want a stunning movie with beautiful scenery, awesome music and characters who seem to be living the part, get Masterpiece Theater's version of Jane Eyre with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre-Masterpiece-Theatre-2006/dp/B000LPQ6DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre (Masterpiece Theatre, 2006)</a>&nbsp;It is the perfect balance between being very accurate to the book but also entertaining and even more romantic than the book; not beyond some humor too.

815057,5,6304211740,This is by far the best Jane Eyre movie yet. I had to own this classic. My 13 year old Grandaughter was here for a visit this summer. We watched it together and now she has fallen for it too. My husband also agrees that is is very well done. Love it!,1217462400,,250,3.826923076923077
815058,3,6304211740,"Jane Eyre is one of my most beloved classics.  Everyone has different tastes and takes on Bronte's wonderful literary work, so when offering my review on this adaptation to it, its of course based upon my opinion and perception.

For me this adaptation lacks Bronte's Jane Eyre on so many levels.
The romance is tepid.  The passion is lackluster.  The gothic feel you get when reading the book and following Jane through the dark halls of Thornfield Hall is totally nil here.  Having a dark room lit with candles doesn't constitute ""goth.""  I don't recall a convincing scene of the budding romance either.

Mr. Rochester is a combination of so many extremes of emotion in the book.  He's funny, witty, mischievious, dark, brooding, tormented and quite the rascal - sometimes all within the same scene! William Hurt is none of the above in my opinion.

Jane in the book is quiet and reserved, but her mind is racing and moving with emotion and I just didn't buy that it was happening with Charlotte Gainsbourg's portrayal.  The book goes through extreme highs and lows which is why you can't put the book down once she meets Mr. Rochester. This adaptation never quite pulls that off and just flatlines for me from beginning to end.

My favorite version of Jane Eyre by far is the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version.  It is truly the book brought to life.  After that if pushed for second choice, it would have to be the more recent Masterpiece version.

83' Dalton/Clark version:

When watching the 83' Dalton version, AT FIRST you'll want to throw something at your TV because it is broken up into 30 minute episodes the way the series ran on television and is shown almost as a stage play.  But it doesn't take long to overlook the stagey feel of it because in filming it this way (whether intentional or not) you truly are transported into the dark ambience and mystery of Thornfield Hall. There are shadows at every turn and you find yourself becoming apprehensive as if you were walking those dark halls of echoing laughter along with Jane.

Also, a hearty pat on the back to the casting director of the 83' version for the absolute BRILLIANT casting of Timothy Dalton as the dark, passionate, poetic, tortured, mischievious and introspective soul that is Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Bronte would've been so proud!  He is no longer a character in a book when seeing this version because Timothy Dalton IS Mr. Rochester.
At first I couldn't understand the casting of Zelah Clark but was soon won over by her reserved but sharp portrayal and unearthly appearance.  She truly embodied Bronte's post-Helen Jane as she was able to assert herself without compromising her station and position the same way the book's Jane did. Her acting was incredible too because you felt her emotions as she went through stages of a wide-eyed developing crush, her attempts to supress her feelings for her superior, her fears of the mysteries of the dark hall, her pain when discovering the truth, her resolve not to rebel against her conscience, then following her heart.  Other more modern day Jane portrayals have been far too impertinent for Jane's position in that time period and way more experienced than a Jane whose life's experience consisted only of Gateshead and Lowood.  Bronte fans will truly appreciate and understand how this 25 year old version still stands the test of time.  You can literally open the book and follow it along and believe me, that is a good thing!  Bronte's beautifully written words are not at all lost in this version and Timothy Dalton's delivery is far superior to all Mr. Rochesters cast before or after him.

Masterpiece Theatre 2006

For a more overtly demonstrated ""passion"" that in my opinion defies the period and post Helen Jane, but is beautifully filmed is the Masterpiece Theatre version.  It takes quite the liberties with Jane's moral dilemmas. In some cases dismissing them altogether which when understanding the book's Jane, knows this changes who she is completely.  In this version, neither character really has to guess or question the other's feelings or motives the way you do in the book and the 83 version, thus not as suspenseful in my opinion. However, the actors (not necessarily Bronte's Jane and Mr. Rochester IMO) are still VERY good in spite of the rewritten material they were working with.

With all that said, this William Hurt version just doesn't do it for me - on any level.",1215561600,6,4435,4.8153034300791555
815059,1,6304211740,"I won't take a long time writting this review. Simply put, this film is horrible in my opinion because (1) it leaves out so many scenes that are vival to understanding Jane's passion, (2) its acting is far from superior, (3) its sets are no better than in the 1983 BBC Jane Eyre, and (4) the film costs as much money as many of the other Jane Eyre versions that are considerably more accurate and better produced.

Now, for people who have read the novel ""Jane Eyre"" by Charlotte Bronte, they realize that a man named St. John Rivers plays an important role in the novel. In this film, St. John and his sisters all but eliminated. The same situation of elimination occurs for many other minor characters. The dialogue from the novel that is kept is combined and changed from classic English to modern American. I am sorry if people have a problem hearing the long discussions Jane and Edward have together. However, for a literature fanatic, this Jane Eyre version is much to short - lacking in intelligence.

I personally recommend the 1983 Jane Eyre version starring Timothy Dalton as Edward Fairfax Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre. The BBC film keeps nearly all of the dialogue and many of the scenes. The BBC 1983 film is far more intelligent and insightful into the struggles Jane Eyre faces. For those who dislike Timothy Dalton playing Rochester, I recommend the 1973 BBC adaptation starring Michael Jayston as Rochester. It is also a powerful adaptation, and Jayston actually appears quite vulcan-like.",1209859200,24,1519,4.793893129770993
815060,3,6304211740,"Jane Eyre is by far the most modern and cinematic of the Great Eight novels by the ""Austen/Bronte Team"" simply because it boasts a woman protagonist who never leaves center stage, who has the grit, complexity, intelligence, and character to infuse any length movie with utterly fascinating rhythms. This movie seizes on one of those chords and strums it relentlessly. The result is a pretty good souffle but one that's missing a few key ingredients.

Anna Paquin as the young Jane is surprisingly emotionless and squinty; she makes clear that the film will keep Jane's passion out of the mix. We will get all the stoicism and forbearance imaginable. This Jane Eyre is a saint, one who endures all, overcomes all, and forgives all. She laughs only once when the young executor of her estate chases his wind-blown hat.

She falls in love with the self-centered and distractingly irritable William Hurt as Mr. Rochester as the result, it seems, of a handshake, and the movie is at great pains to convey the fact of her lovesickness in every scene thereafter.

Charlotte Gainsbourg, the adult Jane, is visually astonishing. She is at turns homely and forlorn, then radiant and winning. She always seems to be calling on some inner reserve of courage and strength, and as a result her acting is so restrained I wondered at times if she was still breathing.

Despite all that, I enjoyed the movie, was moved by it, and, most important, I did come to care about gritty Jane and her flawed but ultimately gallant beloved. It is a testament to Bronte's genius that the movie holds together while opting to explore only one facet of fascinating Jane Eyre.",1207526400,6,1645,4.8021201413427566

 This version of the movie addresses that problem. The drama is toned down just enough to make the characters completely believeable. The acting is great and the chemistry between Jane and Rochester is excellent.
 I have seen several versions of Jane Eyre. This is easily the best one. (Do not ever watch the George C. Scott version)!! This is the only time I can remember saying the movie is better than the book.",1192924800,,639,4.5964912280701755
815145,3,6304211740,"Franco Zeffirelli's 1996 version of ""Jane Eyre"" had all the workings of becoming the best adaptation of the fabulous novel. Zeffirelli is known for gorgeously lavish films based of the celebrated classics such as ""Falstaff"" (1964), ""La bohme"" (1965), ""The Taming of the Shrew"" (1967), ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1968), his most famous and beloved film, one of the best screen romances that made me feel incredibly close to its young doomed lovers, and many more.

Zeffirelli's ""Jane Eyre"" is the most visually beautiful color adaptation of four I have seen. The color palette for the scenes outside Thornfield Hall is delicate and romantic and creates the right atmosphere for the blooming romance of Mr. Edward Rochester, the Master of the estate and his young employee, pale, thin, ""almost un-earthy"" but determined and strong-willed Jane Eyre. Charlotte Gainsbourg, a talented subtle and intelligent actress whom I like in every movie I've seen her made a great Jane. Gainsbourg was surrounded by great supporting cast - Anna Paquin (young Jane), Geraldine Chaplin, Fiona Shaw, and Joan Plowright. Plowright gave the best supporting performance in all ""Jane Eyre"" movies as Mrs. Fairfax, a housekeeper of Thornfield Hall and she is one of the reasons to see this movie. Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax is kind, warm woman with sense of humor, intelligence, and understanding of human's nature. She cares about Jane and wishes her happiness but she does not believe that ""people like Mr. Rochester marry their governesses"".

Yes, Zeffirelli's film has a lot to admire but sadly there are some major flaws that spoil the film's charm and decreased it to the level of just an average period peace. One of them is miscast of William Hurt. His Rochester reminds more Richard Mason as Charlotte Bronte described him - passionless and blank-eyed. As good as Gainsbourg was, there was no chemistry between her and Hurt. Hurt neither looked nor played right for the part. He was a big disappointment. Another serious problem is the script. Too many important parts were cut out or strangely mixed together, and several scenes in the end of the movie simply did not make much sense. This is a shame - like I've mentioned, the movie had great potentials but did not realize them all.",1189987200,6,2261,5.01063829787234
815146,2,6304211740,"After reading the book Jane Eyre, I decided to watch every remake of the film that I could find - at least half a dozen. By far the best is the newest one with Rochester as Toby Stephens (what a marvelous flirtatious exchange between Rochester and Jane); another favorite is the Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke production. But this one with William Hurt (who I always liked as an actor) is so bad that it makes me cringe.

There is absolutely no chemistry or romance conveyed between Charlotte Gainsborgh and William Hurt; I could not feel or believe that they loved each other. The performances of both fall flat, flat, flat. I find myself even wondering if the two actors did not even like each other or connect in real life but felt compelled, due to signing their contracts, to play the role of lovers. But neither succeeded in summoning up any real feeling - it just doesn't work!

Joan Plowright is excellent as always, and Charlotte Gainsborgh does make a believable Jane Eyre, but there is no real fire in her, and as a result her outspoken moments feel heavy, as if she were depressed and exhausted and pretending to an energy she does not possess.

Another complaint about the film, probably not obvious to those who haven't read the book, is that the story is distorted and about 1/3 of it omitted. What happened to Jane's fleeing of Rochester and landing at the home of strangers whom take her in and with whom she lives for half a year? Perhaps because of time limitations, Sintjen's role was altered in this film, and the fire was portrayed as Jane was leaving Rochester, and not many months later.

Athough I have seen the 1983 BBC Production, the 1997 A&E Production (borrowed from the Library) but this 1996 Production is the one that I really enjoyed the most and the only one that I brought.
The 1983 BBC Production was in my option made on a small budget. When you are watching it, one feels like they are watching a play. I really did not enjoy it at all.
The 1997 A&E Production was an improvement on the 1983 Production however Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester I did not enjoy. It seemed as many other reviews have commented he spends most of the production yelling and shouting at Jane.
But on the other hand Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre was likable. I think the main reason I couldn't come to enjoy and like this version is performance by Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester.
Now the 1996 production I enjoyed watching it so much so that I have seen it four times already and I only got the DVD from Amazon on Friday 18th May.
Franco Zeffirelli has done a wonderful job. From the cast to the locations to the costumes to the music. Everthing in this version was first rate.
I much perfer William Hurt performance as Mr Rochester. One can see that he is not a happy man and he is diffcult to understand but he does not spend the whole production yelling or shouting.
Anna Paquin is a great talent and she is amazing as the young Jane.
Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the adult Jane. From the three versions I have seen her performance was the one I really enjoyed the most and one could sense what she is feeling.
One of many scenes that I enjoyed was when Jane goes back to see her Aunt Reed as she is dying and requested to see Jane.
Jane offers her Aunt forgivness for all that she has done to her. She pulls away from Jane. Jane then replys ""Love me or Hate me as you will,  you have my Full and Free Forgivness"" What a prowerful message.
To the people that have not seen this movie I say make up your own mind about this Production and don't base you decision on other reviews. If I did that I would of missed out on something wonderful.
To the people that are looking for family friendly production. This is one of them but I think that your children need to be a certain age before they can watch it.
This is a clean movie about Adversaries, Love and Forgivness. I found this Production of Jane Eyre a very lovely sweet movie one that I am happy to have in my own personal collection.

815149,4,6304211740,"""Jane Eyre"" seems like a slightly odd choice for the great Franco Zeffirelli, but he turned out a slow if excellent adaptation, full of exquisite scenery and picturesque gothic flavour. But what really makes it brilliant is a virtuoso performance by William Hurt as the tortured hero, even if his costar lacks the necessary passion.

Jane Eyre (Anna Paquin) was raised by a nasty aunt-by-marriage, and later taken to a cruel minister's boarding school for girls, where she was humiliated and treated badly. Years later, the grown Jane (Charlotte Gainsbourg) leaves the school behind, taking a job as a governess to a little French girl, at a remote Gothic castle owned by the brooding Mr. Rochester (Hurt).

But there are mysteries at the castle -- mad laughter can be heard from the upstairs, and Rochester is tormented by difficulties that have made him ""hard as an India-rubber ball."" Yet Jane still falls in love with her fiery, reclusive employer, and he falls in love with her strange, strong ways -- until the nastiest secret of his life comes out, and threatens to separate them forever.

Somehow I never expected this classic gothic novel to be the sort of thing Zeffirelli would have done. But he does an excellent job bringing Charlotte Bronte's story to life, and giving it an unearthly beauty -- lots of misty countrysides, sunlit graveyards, and a looming castle up on a hill like a medieval fortress.

It's rather slow-moving -- Jane's nasty childhood takes up a lot of time, for instance. But Zeffirelli builds up suspense and suppressed feeling, all of which climaxes in a literally burning finale -- a magnificently taut and terrifying scene. And he adapts Bronte's prose into intense, vivid dialogue (""Even she is better off here than she would be in a lunatic asylum, but I have spent the last fifteen years in TORMENT!"").

Gainsbourg has the required unearthly plainness that Jane Eyre needs, but she lacks the essential intensity and passion that the character possesses. During the movie's most intense scenes, when Rochester's secret is revealed, she doesn't even blink -- she just stands and stares. A young Anna Paquin has a lot more hidden fire early on.

But William Hurt is simply stellar as Rochester -- he's not young or handsome, but he has the dark, sardonic, embittered, sorrowful thing down to an art. He's especially great in the final lap, where he plays Rochester with all his bitter anger and love unleashed, and Rochester after a fire ravages his home. The final scenes are absolutely exquisite.

The movie suffers from some lackluster acting at time, but Hurt's performance and Zeffirelli's direction make ""Jane Eyre"" an excellent, watchable adaptation. Definitely a good watch.",1176422400,3,2719,4.988962472406181
815150,3,6304211740,"I'd better confess that I'm a Jane Eyre fan since I was a child, having read the book several times.  I can practically recite passages by heart.  I have a small collection of every version of this story I have found.  I keep hoping that I will find the right combination of actors and script... I'm still waiting.

Zeffirelli obviously had some money to spend on this production, and managed to get some very good people to play the respective parts - they LOOKED like they were supposed to look - but even all dressed up in good costumes with great cinematography, the movie doesn't go where it should.

Of course, it would be impossible to condense Bronte's novel into 2 hours and convey the stark psychological drama that is the major theme of the work.  The script is actually well done all things considered.  A friend who watched it with me and didn't know the book liked it well enough.  But there was a sad lack of passion in the grown up Jane and William Hurt just wasn't rakish enough.

I was also very disappointed with the ""meet the mad wife"" scene.  I don't think I have ever seen this rendered as it ought to be, a descent into Hell and damnation and horror.  Zeffirelli's  rendering was even weaker than others.  I suppose that the madness was supposed to be conveyed in the eyes or something, but it was lost on me just like Jane's passion and Rochester's recklessness was so absent due to under-acting.

As I said, Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt really looked the parts, they just weren't up to playing them.  Probably the best acting in the whole movie was by Geraldine Chaplin as Miss Scatcherd at Lowood school and John Wood as Mr. Brocklehurst.  They were really fiendishly evil.

815250,4,6304211740,"Oddly enough the Charlotte Bront's classic novel 'Jane Eyre' has had more cinematic transitions than almost any of the old novels.  The story is powerful but with the frequency of film adaptations, even the story grows tired, unless someone breathes new life into the interpretation.  In this case that breath comes from director Franco Zeffirelli who has engaged Hugh Whitemore to open the story as a screenplay.  The results give a different emphasis to the story and one that for this viewer works well.

In this particular incarnation the rags to riches heroine Jane Eyre is played with subtlety by the beautiful Charlotte Gainsbourg (with Anna Paquin as the younger version) and Rochester the master of the manor is a William Hurt, playing his character more for life and flesh than the usual darkly sinister keeper of secrets.  What results from the combination of cast and crew is a film that is far more a romance than a vapid mystery:  the fire between Jane and Rochester is palpable and is given more space and time than the other versions which elect to dwell on the mad 'wife' upstairs finally destroyed in the fire that brings Rochester down to Jane's initial stance on the social scale.

The cinematography by David Watkin captures the period beautifully as does the musical score by Claudio Capponi and Alessio Vlad.  As with all period pieces the cast of supporting characters paint the various aspects of the novel and here such luminous actors as Joan Plowright, Geraldine Chaplin, Jos&eacute;phine Serre, Maria Schneider, Elle Macpherson, and John Wood among many others offer fully realized portraits of the class distinctions that ruled the era.

815251,1,6304211740,"I have seen most of the versions of jane Eyre. and this has to be my least favorite. I wanted to like it.. I really did. The visuals were wonderful, the moodiness was there. What ruined it was William Hurt.. which I hate to say, because he is one of my favorite actors.
He was simply mis cast.  It ruined the whole film for me. He simply does not fit Mr Rochester's Torchered,anguished, romantic personality. He was too laid back  and seemed bored with no passion, anger, torture or feeling and did not give the comanding performance that the part needed to have. Charlotte Gainsbourg  who played Jane was okay, but she simply was not Jane. She did not have the very plain yet fairy like qualities so described in the book. She had a long neck of a giraffe, jowls not too unlike Marlon Brando in the Godfather and a lower lip hanging like Buba in Forest Gump.
 Good to  watch though..... infact I suggest people watch all the many movies and mini series of this famous story. Make you own comparisons.
This is not the best one to start off with. I suggest Orson Wells or Timothy Dalton's version 1st.",1160006400,11,1100,4.425742574257426

The book is a testament to character shaping destiny and of course a love that transcends and transforms their lives.

The movie fails at all levels and despite a good star cast, leaves the viewer betrayed.  That might seem like a harsh adjective to use but after reading Jane Eyre and being moved by Charlotte Bronte's excellent story, the movie is a complete let down.

The bright spark in this adaptation is Anna Paquin who brings young Jane to life.  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainbourg have no chemistry.  Her acting is wooden and Rochester looks like he would rather be anywhere else than Thornfield.  I don't blame him!",1150675200,12,794,4.794117647058823

Thus,expect a ""plain Jane"" in her role,whose beauty lives in her spirit and courage,rather than her appearance. William Hurt's portrayal of the tortured protaganist was surprisingly outstanding. He is both charming and inaccessible;witty and complex;vulnerable and strong. And most important,convincingly appealing,at least to a middle aged woman! The supporting roles were outstanding,especially the housekeeper. The mystery of the house is both suspenseful and intriguing--it will definitley keep you engrossed.

Beautifully filmed as all Franco Zeffirelli films are, we are taken on a journey of contrasts as Zeffirelli explores the darker nature of human suffering, regret and memory as played out against the lush, natural beauty of the English countryside.

William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg deliver wonderful, though rather subdued performances as the two star-crossed lovers and Anna Paquin is absolutely marvelous in her all too brief role as the young Jane Eyre.",1139702400,49,544,5.252873563218391
815408,3,6304211740,"I might very well call this ""the summarized version."" It just runs for about two hours. Most of the important scenes are here but not all. It has good sets, costumes and a very good view of the countryside. It also gives a good gothic feel on some parts. However, this adaptation I think lacks some soul into it.

Yes, Charlotte Gainsbourgh fits the physical description almost perfectly (only she's not that small). I just get a bit distracted by her accent. Moreover, in contrast to Anna Paquin, she fails a bit. True enough that the adult Jane is not as passionate as young Jane, but the adult Jane still has some spirit that Charlotte Gainsbourgh failed to portray.

William Hurt is not a very bad Rochester. Maybe he isn't given that much time to brood as Timothy Dalton. Due to the time constraint, he failed to develop as much as I wanted with Jane. As a result, his Rochester becomes only pathetic. He is not mad as Timothy Dalton. If one might not have read the book, one might surmise that Jane fell in love with him out of pity or something of that sort.

For me, this adaptation can pass. Yes, ""better than some"" but not that ""well.""",1138320000,8,1145,4.442857142857143
815409,1,6304211740,"I saw this version of Jane Eyre after watching the A&E version (having discovered both versions at our public library).  This version was very disappointing to say the least.  There was absolutely no ""passion"" between Jane and Rochester.  Jane showed no emotion and lacked personality.  The dialogue was delivered without any real feeling or emotion behind it.  As much as I love the book, I was bored with this movie.  I always imagined Jane, despite her Lowood schooling, to have a little fire inside her--able to handle Mr Rochester in his anger and not afraid to tease him a little.  This Jane seemed so melancholy and lacked any spirit.

Although I don't mind changes to a story in general, I found the changes in this story annoying since huge chunks of the book were rewritten:  return to Gateshead, St John and only one sister who take on a completely different role than what was written in the book, Thornfield burning....

If you are looking for a story with more accuracy to the book, I suggest the 1984(?)Timothy Dalton version.  It is a longer version and therefore includes much more of the original story.  Much of the dialogue comes straight from the book.  It is a bit dated and I feel like I'm watching a play rather than a movie, but it is still very good.  The A&E version with Hinds/Morton also makes many changes in the story but at least the characters show some ""passion"".  Neither of these versions of Jane Eyre are perfect but they are far more enjoyable to watch than this version.",1136419200,13,1509,4.6415094339622645
815410,4,6304211740,"This is a film that I continue to go back to over & over. The last time I watched it, I had just finished reading Charlotte Bronte's book (again).  The movie is faithful to the *spirit* of the book - it captures the essence of Jane's upbringing, her stoicism, & the troubled romance with Mr. Rochester.

Why do I like it?

* It's a good adaptation of the book.  (For Bronte fans, I stress the word adaptation.) It doesn't get bogged down representing all the details of the book (for example, St John Rivers is a minor character in the film), but does capture the spirit and the essence of the book.

* It's got a great cast. Charlotte Gainsbourg is a ""dead ringer"" for Jane Eyre/Charlotte Bronte - if you're a fan of the book, this is the person who is in your imagination. Geraldline Chaplin, Amanda Root, Anna Paquin (the young Jane Eyre), William Hurt and Joan Plowright are perfectly cast. Even Elle MacPherson is ably cast.

* Zeffirelli's films are a visual treat - the landscape, the costumes, the scene setting. My favorite scene is when they morph the story from young Jane to grown Jane. Another favorite is when William Hurt first sees her and falls from his horse. The sweeping shots of the countryside are breathtaking.

* The music (I think it's original) is wonderful too!

Why would anyone else like it?

* My husband & I just watched it with my mother-in-law over the holidays. My mother-in-law is a huge devotee of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and the older film versions (think Greer Garson) of their books. Despite her preference for older films, she couldn't find fault with the film (I consider this a huge victory). Even my husband liked it and he is neither a devotee of older films or classic romantic English novels. He hasn't read Jane Eyre.

* The DVD has extra features that are interesting, e.g., interviews with Joan Plowright (who grew up near the Brontes' parsonage) and with Franco Zeffirelli which provide additional background on Jane Eyre and the film.",1136073600,25,1992,4.64957264957265
815491,4,6304211740,"I had avoided watching this version of Jane Eyre for almost 10 years for one compelling reason:  the thought of William Hurt as Rochester gave me a physical pain.  I couldn't imagine a blond and pasty Rochester with a tendency to squint and whine.  Mr. Hurt's American-ness also seemed like a colossal drawback in portraying a staple character of English literature, particularly as he was the only American in the cast.  I had visions of another laughable outing ala Kevin Costner as Robin Hood.  Having finally viewed it on a night with nothing better to do, I'm pleasantly surprised-He didn't bollocks it up!  I saw the classic version long ago with Orson Welles, and while his portrayal is hazy in my memory, he remains my image of Rochester as he was physically depicted in the novel.  However, with Hurt's blond hair darkened & sporting unflattering mutton-chop sideburns, he is transformed into a much rougher-looking version of his usual somewhat effete self, and so his interpretation of Rochester is not as ridiculous as first imagined.  To his credit he did not attempt a British accent; Bronte's dialog is quite stilted enough in a straight reading and that would've only made things much worse.  Paired with Charlotte Gainsbourg, he makes a surprisingly effective, if unconventional, Rochester.  His habitual pained expression actually serves the part.  Charlotte Gainsbourg steps into the part of Jane with a near-perfect fit.  She embodies Bronte's heroine in every detail but one: her distinct French accent is rather jarring in this most English of English girls.  She is most effective when she is still, and the camera lingers on her austere yet compelling face.  She lacks the spirit of Anna Paquin as young Jane, who is excellent in her all-too-brief role, but she nails Jane's solemn watchfulness & pride.  The transition between the two actresses is cleverly and plausibly handled as they suggest one another physically, even if they don't look exactly alike.  Gainsbourg and Hurt manage an awkward chemistry together which is appropriate, though they fail to solve one of the greatest mysteries of English literature:  Why exactly is 20-year-old Jane, whip-smart & nobody's fool, so drawn to this moody, brusque lout who is old enough to be her father?  Bronte never really explains it, so a movie adaptation can hardly hope to.  The movie, as the book, ends with Jane in the arms of her scarred, misanthropic boss, and we cheer, I guess . . .even though the smart move for Jane would have been to take her newly-inherited money & move to the Riviera or some other less-gloomy place.  Director Zeffirelli has assembled an all-star cast of heavy hitters to lend support, including Joan Plowright as Mrs. Fairfax, John Wood as the cruel & Dickensian master of Lowood School, Geraldine Chaplin playing against type as a cruel headmistress & Maria Schneider, in a tiny & essentially non-speaking part, as the crazy wife in the attic.  She is notable for just how changed she looks from her ingenue days in 'Last Tango in Paris'. Also deserving mention is the charming little French actress who plays Adele. All in all, a successful rendering, even Mr. Rochester..",1130457600,18,3183,4.990530303030303
815492,4,6304211740,"As someone who has both read the book and also watched 4 different adaptations at this point (this one, and the Samantha Morton, Timothy Dalton, and Welles/Fontaine versions), I can say definitively than none of them is genuinely ""true"" to the book.  But that should not be a surprise to anyone.  How do you take a book that is told in the first person, with Jane as our narrator, and expect things NOT to change the moment the camera forces you to the cool distance of third-person storytelling?  The Dalton version comes closest to a literal scene-by-scene reenactment, but it fails (in my opinion) largely because of the wooden performance of Zelah Clarke, who is the wall you see Timothy Dalton talking to.  And how true is it to the book to have Timothy Dalton simply sitting there staring, for what seems like an eternity, at the pivotal moment his ""Jane"" is purportedly bearing her soul to him?

This film, like the other three non-Dalton versions, strays far from the book's storyline in at least one significant way. (I know other reviewers seem to think the characters' heights and hair colors are ""significant"", but personally I mean only the highly altered St. John Rivers part of the story).  That story change is truly annoying just because it makes no sense--Jane wouldn't run away to Gateshead Hall, because it would be the first place Rochester would look for her.  But let's remember that Bronte's actual story also strains credulity here:  in the novel, Jane runs off to God-Knows-Where, and preposterously (though conveniently) ends up at her first cousins' house.

We forgive the book for that, because the point of the book lies not there, but in its dealing with the interplay between love and the social code.  Morality and responsibility without love at worst results in Brocklehurst and Aunt Reed, and at best only in the cool proposals of Rivers that are based more on duty than on affection.  But (the story tells us) you can't just follow love without any regard for anything else, which is what Rochester would propose.  Jane's quest is to find love that does not conflict with virtue and duty, and the reason I like this film version is that I believe it best captures, in Jane's face, the perils of her quest.  The beauty of this version, despite its annoying St. John Rivers' variation, lies in the chemistry between the youthful Gainsbourg and the older William Hurt.  Of all the versions I've seen, this is the one where the performances come closest to evoking the characters' relationship in the novel, and the balancing act they play between their duties to others and society and their love and regard for each other.  Yes, there are departures, but the emotional core is there, every time Hurt and Gainsbourg appear together on the screen.  Fastforward through the Rivers portion if you must (and I do, sometimes) but don't pass this up just because of it.",1124928000,5,2896,4.796780684104628
815493,2,6304211740,"Let me first say that I think Zeffirelli is a great director and he has done some wonderful things for opera (I love his otello with Domingo). Also I understand that every director and script writer has his/her own interpretation of a book. But it does not justify the cutting to pieces of the main story, juggling with the characters in the book, leaving out three quarters of the story and changing plotlines so much that if this movie had not been called Jane Eyre, I would hardly have recognized it.

Now for the actors, I think there were some serious miscasts here. Gainsbourgh is a very romantic Jane, nothing of the passion a Jane Eyre should have, nothing intelligent.

William Hurt I really loved in the Big Chill, but this was the worst miscast. He does not seem at ease with the role and was just too sad and too romantic, nothing exacting or fastidious. I always imagined Rochester as a little bit sad but also angry at fate and life in general.

The two stars are for the filmic qualities and the music. The movie itself is very much confusing as it tends to 'hop' from one scene to the other. It is too fragmented to be enjoyable.

Just stick to the Dalton/Clarke BBC mini series which is now available on DVD and at a very good price too.",1124323200,7,1254,4.415584415584416

A special thank you to him for doing so - it is extremely important to treat masterpieces with such care.  He was the perfect choice for this movie.  If I were going to say anything bad about this film, I would have to say that the performances of the other actors seem to be a struggle in comparison to that of Mr. Hurt.

William Hurt was excellant as Mr. Rochester and it was easy to see why Jane would fall in love with him. I also very much liked the actress that played Jane Eyre. She did look the age and looked plain and depressed (like I think anyone with Jane Eyre's life would look). The look of the film was also excellant. Anna Paquin as the young Jane Eyre was also an excellant choice. I prefer this version over the 1997 Samantha Morton version. That version Mr. Rochester is far from appealing, Jane is not so believable and it is hard to believe the two would have an attraction for each other. The 1997 version's Mr. Rochester is very ugly (uglier than I'd imagined Mr. Rochester), mean, rude and very demanding/commanding. He doesn't reflect a tortured soul, but rather a plain old grumpy and mean one and his portrayal of passion and attraction is rather poor. There were no sparks between the two, only poorly delivered lines. William Hurt, on the other hand, is able to portray both the sarcasm, wit, poor manners and inner turmoil of Mr. Rochester. He is also far more capable at portraying passion and love (as is the actress that plays Jane) than comparted to the 1997 Samantha Morton version.

I cared deeply for all of the main characters in this film and was able to connect with the story. I will be adding this film to my period romance collection.",1107820800,8,1510,4.531135531135531

William Hurt is tolerable and although he is too mellow being Mr. Rochester, it seemed that he had tried hard to create some kind of chemistry between himself and Gainsbourg.

In fact, the version starring Timothy Dalton, in passion, plot and character development, and faithfulness to the book far surpasses all the other versions available on DVD today.

Jane, thoughout the novel, is so delicately molded into a fun, teasing, and brilliant young lady and Mr. Rochester into a passionately devoted man.

 The glaring error of this version has to be William Hurt as Rochester. Although Mr. Hurt is a capable actor, he doesn't look at all the way Mr. Rochester is portrayed in the novel. Rochester should be a dark haired, brooding character. He has been far better represented on film by Orson Welles and Timothy Dalton. I personally prefer a British actor to be in this role, as well.

Blanche Ingram is supposed to be black haired. Although the average reader would not know why, this is a very important part of Victoriana. Black hair in this time period was considered the apex of beauty. Blanche is supposed to be the most beautiful women in the town.

I didn't care for the omissions of plot or character, either. The whole section where Jane meets the Rivers family is rushed. We never find out she is their cousin.

I loved how he acted it, if only they could place his talent into another body. The scenery was gorgeous, just as I might have imagined it. It adheres to the story MOSTLY (the parts it did tell, that is). The music was astounding as well. Now, for the cons of this movie. First of all, it just simply left out SO MUCH of the story for it to be impactful! It also changed so much after Jane left Rochester to something less dreary than what really happened to her.

To me, he IS Mr. Rochester. The only negative thing I have to say is the storyline strayed from the book... a lot. But we must keep in mind the book is very long and this movie isn't a big Hollywood creation. A smaller budget combined with time constraints force the writers to come up with a creative way to jam the story into 2 hours. I think they've done a nice enough job of making sense so those who've never read the book won't be left with too many questions. Those of us who are familiar with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre can fill in the spaces quite nicely with our imaginations. Recently I watched the A&E version of Jane Eyre.

815776,5,6304211740,"I have been a Jane Eyre fan since high school and have seen almost all of the different movie versions. This one is my favorite.  Why?  Most importantly, this is the only Jane Eyre film with a ""plain Jane.""  Her unattractiveness is absolutely fundamental to the story.  The other cinematic Janes, Joan Fontaine and Suzanna York are drop dead gorgeous, Samantha Morton is very pretty and Zelah Clark is cute, chubby and perky, nothing like the ""real"" Jane Eyre of the book.  When this book was published in 1847, it was absolutely unheard of to have a plain heroine, but Charlotte Bronte felt strongly about her heroine's plain looks and the book became a phenomenal best-seller in its day.  Despite plain-Jane's best-seller status, most 20-century film adaptations still can't handle the idea of a plain heroine.  Well, this film can and did!
(Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance has been criticized in other Amazon reviews as being less than passioned.  But by the time Jane meets Rochester, her natural passion had been repressed, both by her lengthy austere circumstances and her own strong will.  Her passion therefore, for most of the story is internal.  Charlotte Gainsbourg does a fine job of portraying a Jane Eyre whose turbulent emotions are hidden below a firmly self-controlled surface.)
Secondly, the age difference between Rochester and Jane is fully realized in this film.  They are supposed to be 20 years apart.  All the other Jane/Rochester's look like they are approximately the same age, while William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg don't even look like they belong together -- exactly the point of the story.

Thirdly, there are a few little scenes and lines straight out of the book that I haven't seen in any other adaptations but this one.  For instance, there is a small but key moment in the book -- Rochester smoking a cigar in the garden just before he declares his love for Jane.  In the book, she smells his cigar and tries to escape before he notices her.  To have William Hurt puffing on a cigar at this point in the film is a nice true-to-the-book touch.  There are many other such incidents and lines in this film that I haven't seen in any other versions and haven't had the pleasure of meeting since I read the book.
Of course, given the time limit of this movie, there is some unavoidable tinkering with the plot line.  If you want more of the actual text and plot, get the Timothy Dalton version, but try to keep William Hurt in mind while you watch it. Yes, I know -- he's blond, but he gives an excellent performance.  His good looks are toned down and he manages to be the most compelling Rochester I have yet to see on film.  Timothy Dalton is tolerable in his portrayal but too thin, handsome, and too high strung; his acting is difficult to watch at times. Hurt's portrayal is also far superior to the one actor who has the closest physical resemblence to Rochester -- Orson Welles, whose performance is a string of ridiculous screaming fits.  Watching Cirian Hinds' portrayal is like getting too near a snake pit or a steaming pot of boiling oil; he's way too tortured and it's not a pleasant sight.  Yes, Rochester was a tortured man, but he usually kept it in check and below the surface.  The nuances of this complicated character are lost on most all of the the actors that have attempted to play Rochester; all of the actors that is, except William Hurt who brings to his performance all the irony and subtlty the others are sorely lacking.
William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg are as cinematically close as you will get to the physicality of this famous couple of literature.  Although the superiority of this film can be measured by the plainness of it's leading characters, I must conclude by saying that it is beautifully shot and includes a gorgeous soundtrack.",1072224000,8,3815,4.745454545454545

I thought the beginning of the movie depicting Jane's childhood (I am not referencing it back to the text for authenticity, mind you) was quite good.  I watched this with interest.
I rather liked the young Adelle and the other characters at Thornfield.  However, the grave dissapointment came from Mr. Rochester.  While I am sure this gentleman may be a fine actor elsewhere, he was not suited for this role.  His coloring, his non-accent, his build, his mannerisms, all of these things gave him a large hurdle to overcome, and unfortunately he never did.  I found him to be very weird... not dark and peculiar like the true Mr. Rochester.  Because of this, I did not find myself longing for the ultimate union of the two characters in the end.
The black and white version was far better.",1061683200,3,1064,4.587301587301587
815778,2,6304211740,"The book Jane Eyre was assigned to me this year in 10th grade. It has moved from a homework assignment to my second favorite novel. Our teacher allowed us to view this film in class. In the beginning it is very good, the interpertation of Jane's traumatizing expericence in the red room was very well portrayed.  I believe that the actors were casted very well. Jane, Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Reed, St. John, all looked VERY similar to what I imagined them as. (The only thing that bothered me about Jane Eyre was her teeth. She seemed to have an overbite of somekind and one would think that she has braces or desperatly needs them.) The actors, Jane and Mr. Rochester, made the best out of the script they were given. They were very well paired. I do have several complaints though, I know that one can not transfer a book to film perfectly, but they should follow the story line. (spoiler-if you havn't read the book don't read this) The meeting between Mr. Rochester and Jane when they confess there love is to short and lacks the passionate speach and playfullness that the book has. When Jane is leaving Thornfield catches on fire, this happened later. Also in the film Grace Poole dies, this contradicts the book. Also they don't really explain how she hears his voice and how he heard her calling back- this makes the book seem less gothic. Also in the end Mr. Rochester only regained partial sight in one eye, not all his sight as in the movie. Besides the details the movie is resonable. I have only seen this one, but I have seen the beginning of the older black and white one which looks quite good. This movie is resonable. The settings are good , oh they also left out one of my favorite scenes when Mr. Rochester talks to Jane after they first meet in a chair and he tells her to move closer and pull up her chair.",1053561600,3,1824,4.428571428571429

William Hurt's performance as Rochester is one of the weirdest, and worst, ever put on film.  He plays the role as if Rochester was afflicted with narcolepsy, and is having an especially hard time staying awake.  Hurt's characteristic mumbling and bizarre attempt at an English accent don't help matters much.  I don't see what on earth possesses even that poor governess Jane Eyre to find him even at all attractive.  Weren't there any hunky stableboys she could be dallying with?
There's a far more effective version starring George C. Scott, who is similarly untraditional in his outlook on Rochester but manages through sheer intelligence and acting ability to make it work.  Seek out that version for an entertaining and moving version of this story.",1050364800,2,950,4.974683544303797

This movie effectively mangled my favorite childhood novel. First of all, the casting. Charlotte Gainsbourg does a passable Jane Eyre, but a BLOND ROCHESTER?!.... I think that it would help a lot if whoever were casting an adaptation of such a well-known (and well-loved) book would actually READ the novel...
Another thing that I could not abide--they removed all the romantic/gothic scenes from the movie. ""Stripped of the romanticism"", you call it? I would say, rather, that they took out the most interesting scenes in the novel, including the wonderful Rochester-dress-up-as-a-gypsy scene, where you first begin to believe he loves Jane and not Blanche. And what about the dread that the woman in the attic inspires *before* she appears? For instance, they dispensed with the scene when Bertha walks into Jane's bedroom at night and rips her veil. Gosh, I remember the feeling of impending doom and gloom these chapters inspired--when Rochester is telling Jane that it's only a dream, and you begin to believe him, and hope he's right--until she holds up her torn veil! How could they simply cut them out? Jane Eyre, for all its social significance, is a GOTHIC novel, and such scenes are absolutely important! Without these scenes, it is just another governess story--it certainly is not the Jane Eyre I remember... I say again, ugghhh. Not good...",1045699200,14,1510,5.044
815907,4,6304211740,"This is a fine version of JANE EYRE, and I loved the soundtrack and the actors...most of them.  Elle MacPherson must have had a connection somewhere to have scored the role of Blanche Ingram.  She doesn't cut it as a blonde, and certainly not as a high-society gal of the 1830's.  This is sometimes what happens when supermodels insist on acting.  Charlotte G. as Jane was totally believable.  She was plain and stoic enough to carry it off.
The sequence of events in the beginning was very rushed.  Within the space of a two days Jane fights with her cousins, is spirited away to Lowood School, foments a friendship with Helen Burns, and is with Helen on her deathbed.

Then, as in most cases, i went out and rented the movie, expecting it to as beautiful and intricate as the book. BOY, was I ever wrong.
It was so horrible, I have to admit that the begining was very well portrayed, until we came to the part where Jane had to leave Gateshead. After that, it was all down hill. What really irked me was that Rochester was blone, and didn't seem to  have the complexity of the original character of the book. Also, Blanche was BLONDE! She was supposed to be dark haired, almost raven like, but was she nooooo. The ending was the worst, as it rushed along the introduction of Jane's cousines, and left out the entire point that St. John needed Jane. Uhhh.

The actors were very good, but i wasn't much for their appearances. They did leave out some great scenes from the books, but overall it was a very good film. I would suggest seeing it even though it wasn't a perfect movie. I think even the book readers still might take to it.",1025568000,,540,4.41
815911,3,6304211740,"Out of the four versions (that I know about) of Jane Eyre in movie format, there was only one that truly stood out as being completely representative of the book, and that was the Timothy Dalton version in 1971.  I thought he overacted a little, but that played with the character, so I can pass over that negative...however the interaction between him and Zarah (Black?) was much too unbelievable and strained.
If you want a version to cuddle up with on a rainy Saturday afternoon, then either the William Hurt (1996) or the Orson Welles version in the 40's would be splendid.  The 1997 Samantha Morton/Ciaran Hinds version is my favorite though, being that it really pulls the viewer into the romance of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, even though it cuts and manipulates many of the scenes and actions so as not to be completely recognizable to book enthusiasts.
I have loved this book from the first time I read it, and it is on top of my all time favorite books.  At first, I was disappointed with all the film versions, but after taking the time to really sit down and review and compare each of these (with waaaaaay too much time on my hands in college) I realized what these different versions were trying to do and grew to appreciate all of them for what they are.
No one can recreate the literary masterpiece on film, as is true with almost all classics.  I recommend this film for those who like symbolism over blatant scene recreation, but for those who want the cliffs notes version of the book in form if not fact, try the A&E version (1997).  If you like pouty acting with great record-scratchy sound and the visual depth that only black and white film can give you, Orson Welles is your man.  However, if you are a true book enthusiast, the BBC miniseries with Timothy Dalton is the most true to form and will get you an ""A"" on your book report ;)",1024444800,13,1863,4.480825958702065
815912,2,6304211740,"That simple remark of mine was all I had to say when my friend Norma wanted to know why I didn't like this version of ""Jane Eyre"", which she was preparing to see herself. ""What kind of comment is that?"" she had to ask. But once she had seen it, she understood.
Ever read ""Jane Eyre""? Jane is a small insignificant-looking person who conceals a tumult of emotion smoldering within. She used to be a real wildcat when her aunt was raising her, but when Jane got shipped off to Lowood, an awful boarding school, she met up with two individuals who tamed her. One was a fellow student Helen, and the other was a favorite teacher, Miss Temple. So Jane adopted a quiet mien, but inside was still the tumultuous nature. She lets it out again only once, when her new employer Mr. Rochester plays with her emotions, pretending to be engaged to the wealthy Blanche Ingram when all along it's Jane he is going to propose to. She rages and storms about how she has a heart as great as his, even if she is only a little governess. Since he's a  raging and storming guy himself, this is language he understands.
Well anyway, this Jane is usually hard to convey in a movie. The latest A&E version is just awful; that Jane just thought she was all that. She didn't even act like she had an employer, which is very untrue to the book. Joan Fontaine did a convincing job of acting like she was a working girl having to answer to higher-ups, but lacked passion. However, she did convey littleness and insignificance. Now THIS Jane, at a height close to Mr. Hurt's, couldn't convey anything except monumentality. She was just much too tall! How could such a tall woman ever feel insecure? She didn't convey those feelings, and she must on some level. Actually, they had a good candidate for Jane in the movie, and let her slip by them; the actress Amanda Root (of ""Persuasion"" fame) plays Miss Temple. She really would've been marvelous. I suppose they felt her too old already for the part, but I would've forgiven her that for everything else I know she'd have brought to the role.
Other things I found wanting concerned the lighting. ""Jane Eyre"" is a great Gothic romance, and Gothic romances are usually in dark places. This version had far too much light and lots of pretty garden strolls; not authentic in feeling. William Hurt is too amiable and blond for the brooding, dark, antisocial Rochester. And what about Joan Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax? Did she have a large percentage or something? I ask because every time I looked, there was some sort of slave camera shooting her reaction to whatever was going on. You'd have thought she was the protagonist, and not the governess. One thing she learned from her late husband Laurence Olivier was how to ham up a scene if necessary.
So, another disappointing ""Jane Eyre"" for the records. Perhaps one day, the perfect Jane will dawn on the horizon, but until then, make do with Joan Fontaine.",1023926400,2,2922,4.576335877862595
816013,3,6304211740,"This movie is an ok movie to watch.  If you have read the book then you can see why I lowered teh rating.  This adaptation of the novel Jane Eyre leaves out primary parts.  This occurs especially in the beginning where you see practically only a minute of when she is at home with her aunt then she is fastily whisted off to Lowood.  The time she spends at Lowood is even shorter.  The relationship between Helen and Jane exceedingly lacking.  They hardly even know each other if you watched the movie and she cries and is depressed when she wasn't even really an intimate friend with her.  In the novel she was an intimate friend with her.  It makes a lot more sense in the book.  In the movie they hardly even have a relationship.  She's very fastily sent away and is even faster at Thornfield.  When they were at Lowood it was probably the most, according to the book, correct.  However,  they still take out one primary scene before they leave and when Rochester's wife comes into her room.  The acting was done very well but there was so little of the original novel.  If you haven't read the book then it would seem like a good movie but to people who have read the book they lacked many important things from the book.

816015,2,6304211740,"Let me start off by saying that this movie production of Jane Eyre bares little resemblance to the classic novel by Charlotte Bronte. The beginning is rather slow in comparison to the rest of the movie, while the end is needlessly rushed. It's almost as if Mr Zeffirelli began making the movie with extreme gusto and then got fed up of it halfway through and decided to finish the project hurriedly, which is a pity because Jane Eyre is a wonderful piece of literature and certainly does not deserve such carelessness.
Now on to the main problems with this movie. Firstly, although Charlotte Gainsbourg makes a competent Jane, she lacks the maturity of the Jane in the novel. Perhaps this is because Zeffirelli did not really show her as a protagonist - we don't get to see things from her point of view all that much, and sometimes the other characters overshadow her. Also, her expression rarely changes throughout the whole movie (she always looks like she has her teeth clenched), which is quite a drawback because Jane is supposed to have a lot of emotion in her, even though she looks plain and grey on the outside. This vital trait of Jane is something that Gainsbourg unfortunately failed to bring out.
Rochester is by far the biggest mistake in this movie. If you are a true admirer of the novel, I suggest you avoid watching this movie, solely for the fact that the Rochester of the book has been completely and utterly destroyed in the movie. Most readers would agree on what Rochester should look like: tall, dark and almost gruff, yet somewhat attractive. Here, Rochester has been transformed into a lilly-livered, waterey-eyed blond zombie who bears absolutely no similarity at all to the Rochester of the book! Sacrilege! This was without a doubt the *biggest* disappointment of the movie for me. He almost looks clownish when he falls off his horse in his opening scene!
While I'm at it, another character which has been completely ruined is Blanche Ingram. In essence, she is supposed to be elegant, dark-haired, slightly dark-skinned and somewhat arrogant, but still with a lot of flair and beauty, i.e. an absolute contrast to plain Jane. I certainly wasn't expecting to see a somewhat quiet, blonde, boring Blanche with her hair in two bunches! Although she is one of the less important characters, the contrast between her and Jane is important and should be brought out. Sadly I did not see that here.
Apart from the bad casting, as I mentioned earlier the beginning is slow while the end is rushed. There is hardly any balance in this production. Zeffirelli did Jane's childhood rather well, with Reed House and Lowood School being quite similar to the way most readers would imagine them. However, after the point where Jane leaves Thornfield, Zeffirelli clearly did not care to finish the movie properly: Jane suddenly wakes up in the Rivers household (totally out of the blue), learns that she has inherited a large sum of money, learns that the Rivers are her cousins, finds out that Thornfield has been burnt down, hears Rochester calling her name, goes to him, marries him and there's the happy ending! Blink and you'll miss it.
Well, in Zeffirelli's defence, Jane Eyre *is* quite a long book and is more suited to be made into a mini-series rather than a movie. But still, I was rather disappointed by this production of the novel. I strongly advise true fans of the book *not* to watch this movie. I can confidently say that you will be disappointed too.",1022457600,8,3485,4.781094527363184

They decided that the REAL story would not sell and the that the author was obviously wrong in every decision she made as far as plot, character and theme. Basically, it doesn't seem like the people who made this movie even LIKE ""Jane Eyre"" or even READ it. The plot isn't even reminiscent of the novel's tone and message. Jane Eyre is transformed from a strong, moral woman to a wishy-washy girl and every single supporting character is massacred cruelly. How can anyone who liked the book like this movie? This adaptation takes the deep psychological journey of Jane Eyre and turns it into a boring, dark and superficial romance tale. I don't think it could've been any worse. Jane's childhood is, granted, done pretty well. But every single change made to the original (and there are tons) makes the movie that much worse and is an attempt to mass market the sensational parts of the story and downplay the intellect.

He plays the elusive, eccentric country noble Mr. Rochester exactly the way he should be played. He's quietly passionate, sexy, and smoldering, while still exhibiting signs of being a real stuffy gentleman. Inwardly tormented, Rochester is perfect.
Charlotte Gainsbourg takes on the challenging role of the title character, petit and plain Jane Eyre. Gainsbourg's unearthly prettiness adds immeasurably to her character, but she represses some of Jane Eyre's passion that we find in the book. The chemistry between Gainsbourg and Hurt is tense and shaky - exactly how it should be.

A large part of the pleasure of this ""Jane Eyre"" comes from its sense of being a throwback to lavishly-mounted prestige pictures of yore which, unlike such productions today, featured a more authentic sense of romance and less bombast.  Zeffirelli doesn't drag the show on; his editing is quite brisk, without compromising the lushness of his visuals (his Baroque sensibility expresses itself with almost evangelical power when Helen Burns unleashes her red mane--the gift of beauty which the Lowood puritans would strip away).  Esteemed cinematographer David Watkin is in at least Oscar-nomination-worthy form here, managing the occasional touch of soft-focus diffused morning light without making the picture look frilly.  As ubiquitous as badly-done gold tones have become, it's a great relief to look at a film with such a lush sense of the barren.  But best of all, Charlotte Gainsbourg is absolutely hypnotic as Jane.  To paraphrase another Bronte: ""Nelly, she IS Jane!""  It's amazing to behold such an unconventional beauty-- praise the gods for Zeffirelli bringing her to an English-language audience.  Her brooding manner, her sense of merit scorned, her hidden yet bound-to-burst amorousness--Gainsbourg ravishes with her quiet luminescence.  And the set of her mouth is one of nature's masterworks.  I could never forget her face in the mirror--she manages to incarnate the literary Jane's patient capacity for self-blame with tear-inducing force.

Case in point: I've been haunted (pleasantly) by its breath-taking scenery shots and its beautiful background music.  I've watched this film three times since I bought the tape-and I bought it just two days ago!!
I must confess that I did not take to Gainsbourg's Jane immediately; I found her a bit too reserved.  But cold and stony, as some people find her to be?  Never, for I warmed up to her soon enough: I was drawn by her serene manners, her soft-spoken and intelligent words, and her somewhat otherworldly beauty.  And surely William Hurt's Mr. Rochester would easily fall in love with a woman of such qualities, no?  This is why I must strongly object to the observation that there is no chemistry between Gainsbourg and Hurt.  I see plenty to love in both Gainsbourg's and Hurt's characters.  Why, the scene where Mr. Rochester says good-night & shakes hands with Jane after the ""midnight fire"" incident positively sizzles!!! (But doesn't EVERY scene where the two appear together feel so?)  This is not a dramatic film in which grand passion oozes from every scene, but it's not over-the-top, either.

The actress playing Jane showed no emotion throughout the entire movie -- not when Edward was professing his love for her or when she found out he was already married. Throughout the entire movie her expression didn't change once. And, William Hurt as Edward was not much better. Throughout the movie I could find no reason why Edward would be drawn to Jane or vice versa -- there was absolutely no chemistry/intense feelings/passion between the actors/characters. Even during Edward's speech about there being a string between his and Jane's heart, he doesn't even look at her! They're not even close -- he's sitting down looking away and she's standing up. I will admit that the supporting cast was good, with the exception of Anna Paquin as young Jane. I don't think she did a very good job of conveying emotion. The girl who played young Jane in the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version was very good. If you want to see passion, then please check out the version I mention.

Still, this version COULD have been better. Charlotte Gainsbourg  did look very much how I imagined Jane, but she always came across as so  cold. It's true that in the book Jane does not always express how she  feels, but she is not as stony as Miss Gainsbourg portrays her.
William  Hurt wasn't the best Rochester, either. I don't know what they were  thinking, casting a blonde, conventionally handsome actor to play the dark  and brooding Mr. Rochester! It even says on the back of the box something  like, ""Jane Eyre falls for her rich and HANDSOME employer..."" I'm  sure Charlotte Bronte would have been insulted that her character was  changed to the point of blasphemy. Elle McPherson as Blanche Ingram was  pretty bad too.
I did like Anna Paquin as young Jane though, and the  elderly woman who played Mrs. Fairfax was perfect.
It's not just the  acting that bothered me...I think they ruined three of my favorite scenes.  The first is the scene in which Mr. Rochester dresses up as a Gipsy woman  to find out if Jane loves him. This is a WONDERFUL passage in the book, and  every version of Jane Eyre I have ever seen always leaves it out! I have a  feeling that they originally filmed this scene, but they ended up having to  cut it so the movie wouldn't be too long. So I was disappointed about  that.
The second scene I didn't like was when Mr. Rochester proposes to  Jane. When I read it in the book it brought tears to my eyes, because it  was so beautiful and passionate, but in this movie it just falls  flat.
Mr. Rochester: Duhhh, I love you. Will you marry me? Jane: Mmm,  sure, why not.
OK, so maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but that's how it  felt to me. That scene was severely downplayed; it didn't move me at all.  And why didn't they film it in the garden by the big tree, like it is in  the book? I thought that was an important detail.
I also thought it was  cheesy how they showed Thornfield burning down JUST when Jane was leaving!  Please, she just walked out the door and she doesn't even stop or notice  when the mansion catches on fire? I think this was done for dramatic  effect, but it came across to me as ridiculous.
Still, I give the movie 2  stars, because although Mr. Hurt didn't really look his part, he did an OK  job of playing it. And I did like how they did the scene in which Mr.  Rochester admits to having been married before, and presents Bertha Mason  to everyone who was attending his and Jane's wedding. That was pretty well  done, and pretty faithful to the book. I'd recommend this movie for that  scene alone.
I think that above all, if a movie version of Jane Eyre is  to be made, it MUST be faithful to the book. The novel is wonderful enough  that they wouldn't have to change anything.",968371200,17,3042,4.370304114490161
816147,3,6304211740,"I rented the movie and watched it many times.  Then, I ended up buying the movie sound-track.
I definitely agree with those reviewers who thought  Franco Zeffirelli had picked badly to cast Wiiliam Hurt as Rochester.  Hurt  did not possess the dynamic charm of Rochester.  He was too excessive in  terms of Rochester's melancholic nature and lack of the explosive desire  that Rochester sometimes exercised in the book. I do not see how Hurt's  Rochester could be madly in love with Jane.  However, for the rest of the  cast, they did an excellent job and the Thornfield Hall situated in the  movie had the atmosphere of the book.
My gratitude in this review is  actually addressed to Alessio Vlad & Claudio Capponi, who are the  composers of this movie sound-track.  Their music has given me the spirit  of Jane Eyre.  The composition of this sound-track matches perfectly to the  important plots of the book.  With some imagination and the help of this  beautiful music, I have my own Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre in my mind for a  moment.  That is enough.",967248000,5,1057,4.697802197802198

816150,2,6304211740,"Recently I have finished reading Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. I was so entranced by the story. I ran to the movie store to rent the video after I was finished the book. In short, I think the movie made the story lose it's  flare. Yes, of course, the main points of the story were covered. Yet, the  parts that helped greatly to things such as character development and the  passion of the story were left out! The scenes between Edward and Jane were  so short in their dialogue. Those scenes that were shortened were important  to the development of the relationship between Jane and Edward. Not to  mention how the end of the story was dulled down to nothingness. The actors  that portrayed Jane and Edward were different. I liked the performance that  William Hurt gave. Though he seemed too gentle for the character sometimes,  he did have his many moments. The actress who played Jane, Charlotte  Gainsbourg, was dull. Yet, it was not her fault. In the book, Jane has so  much vivacity because it is told from her point of view. In the movie  Jane's thoughts were not touched upon, so Jane seemed a dull character. So  it is not Gainsbourg's fault, but the fault was to choose not to narrate  her thoughts. That does seem difficult to do, but it is some what important  to lure people to Jane's character. For those who have never read the book  but wish to later, I would advise against this version. You will know plot  during your reading, and that shall spoil the book as it adds charm to your  known plot. For those who have read the book, I would also advise against  the movie. You'll probably nit pick it too much as I am currently doing.  For those who have never read the book and don't plan to, you might enjoy  this film.",932083200,3,1738,4.453968253968254

Upon hearing that it is also a movie, my teacher recommeded this version, and I was impressed. Of course, they changed a few things, but that always happens when novels are make into movies! My only critism is the way it ended. The ending was like that of the novel, however, it seemed to fly by in the movie! About the last 100 pages of the book only took up about 12 minutes of the movie! Also, like some of the other review say, it can be pretty dull if you haven't read the book. So my advise, read it first, then rent the movie.",928800000,4,704,4.1838235294117645

7865385,2,6304211740,"You could probably find worse screen adaptations of the novel, but this is not one of the better ones. I was pretty perplexed as to why they forced the last third of the book or so into 15 minutes, when they could have easily cut out some of Jane's childhood without harming the story at all. My guess is they did that just to give Anna Paquin more screen time. (She's listed in the blurb, since--ooh! she's an Academy Award winner!--even though she played a relatively small part.)

However, this prioritization of the early events makes the ending confusing and a little ridiculous, I think. It's like um...why is Saint John proposing to Jane? He doesn't seem like a remotely important character, so why throw that in? He's going to be a missionary? Okay, that's mildly interesting...but what does it have to do with anything else? And why the heck is Mr. Rochester still living in a burned-out Thornfield Hall? It just really seems like a less-skilled director than Zeffirelli could have found a more sensible way to tell the story, less important events to cut out. I don't usually demand that movies slavishly follow the books they're based on just to follow them, but I do like more even and understandable story-telling than this.

A lot of reviewers seemed to dislike William Hurt as Mr. Rochester. I thought he was okay, for the most part (not great--more angry and less broody than I thought he seemed in the book. And he didn't look the way Mr. Rochester was described at all, but I think that's less important than behavior.) Charlotte Gainsbourg, on the other hand, was absolutely wooden. It seems like it would have been easy to find a better Jane than her.

Overall, not really worth your time, IMHO. If you're looking for a good screen adaptation of the novel, I recommend the 2006 miniseries with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stevens. I recognize it's a lot harder to fit everything into a theatrical film than a four-hour miniseries, but they really could have done a better job with this one.",1517270400,,2003,4.684659090909091
7865386,5,6304211740,"I read reviews, with interest and some perplexity.  I own this version and the one with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samantha-Morton-and-Ciaran-Hinds/dp/B00L8O2QVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds</a>, love them both, for different reasons.  I hadn't read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-book/dp/B0082RHRHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the book</a>&nbsp;in years but just did, to refresh my memory.  I had strong feelings about it.  I bookmarked passages that I found especially powerful or meaningful, included below- just skip them if you're not interested.  I watched both versions again, to compare them with the book.

***SPOILERS FOLLOW BUT NOT OF THE ENDING***  This version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt is by far the closest to the novel.  There are many scenes straight out of the book that are omitted in other versions, e.g., Jane's skill as an artist.  Much of the dialogue, Charlotte's prose, is word for word intact in many scenes.  As an aside though, something I've noted in general about adaptations of novels is that there isn't always a close correlation between cleaving to the narrative and dialogue of a novel, and the characterization (actors' affect, performances, context, etc), which highlights the influence the director, actors and others have (and thus can put a very different spin) on the finished product.  I read partly in reaction to criticisms relating to such issues in negative reviews.

In terms of characterization, I've long thought Ciaran Hinds was closer to Rochester as described in the book, e.g., age (39), appearance (dark, grim), having a big head, his wide girth, demeanor, being out of control emotionally, capricious, unreasonable, even dangerous (there's a scene in the book where he comes very close to doing her real harm).  He's difficult, a BAD BOY, a type irresistible to some women, like catnip to a cat.

William Hurt's Rochester, whom I also like very much, is quite different- more conventionally handsome, aloof, enigmatic, etc, intriguing in a different way (Ive been a fan of Hurts for many years, e.g., in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doctor/dp/B004UP3D4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doctor</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Altered-States/dp/B0012DQZLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Altered States</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Accidental-Tourist/dp/B001N3FDX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Accidental Tourist</a>, one of my all-time favorites- I admit Im biased).  Jane later meets St. John (pronounced ""SIN-jin""), who is the polar opposite of Rochester, a fair Adonis, appearance-wise, but cold as a fish (except in his love of the Lord), and contrasts the two (more so in the book).  He is very well-portrayed in this version by the marvelous Samuel West.  One reviewer likened the Morton-Hinds version to Beauty and the Beast, and I got that vibe too (though I don't find Ciaran Hinds beastly in the least).

And while I'm at it, I'd forgotten how MARVELOUS this book is.  It's incredible in its intelligence and arch feminism.  Would someone tell me why in every film version I can recall it's Mr. Rochester who puts out the fire in his bedroom, while a frightened Jane stands by helplessly?  In the novel it's JANE who puts out the fire, is unable to rouse Rochester (overcome by smoke) until AFTER she's extinguished the flames and saved his life.  This version is no different, but even so, Charlotte Gainsbourg turns in a powerful, bravura performance as Jane.

In comparing Charlotte Gainsbourg with Samantha Morton, at first I thought the latter a mite too personable, that she smiled too often, but in the novel Rochester mentions these aspects of her demeanor again and again.  In re-reading the novel I realized I'd forgotten her sass, her secret amusements, her good sense, her strong opinions, and most of all her passion and deep desire, as expressed in the novel, and Morton captures those aspects very well. Indeed, Rochester observed early on ""...you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.""  But Gainsbourg radiates more power, more self-possession- shes a force to be reckoned with.  (I've seen her in many films, particularly French ones, a very fine actress, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Petit-Amour/dp/B073SGGLTZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Petit Amour</a>, for example.)  Bronte published Jane Eyre under a masculine-sounding nom de plume, but it didn't take long for the news to leak that it was penned by a woman.  She was then criticized for being ""coarse"", a euphemism for passionate or lurid.  As I recall this was the first book written in first person singular from a female protagonist's point of view, and readers were stunned by the desire and passion expressed by Jane Eyre, as well as the adult subject matter.  A middle aged man, describing his affairs and mistresses in detail to a young woman in his employ?  Unnerving, and yet- a very fine character study of two people, and the dynamic between them.  Example:

Rochester:  ""Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me [in sin].

[Jane]:  This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  Oh, comply! it said.  Think of his misery; think of his dangerlook at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despairsoothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for you? Or who will be injured by what you do?

Later that night:
I would have got past Mr. Rochesters chamber without a pause; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was a heavena temporary heavenin this room for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death, and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of this.

Then:
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wanderingand oh! with agony I thought of what I left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him nowin his roomwatching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and be HIS.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforterhis pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his self-abandonmentfar worse than my abandonmenthow it goaded me!  It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had injuredwoundedleft my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.

(At the end I'll include another quote from this same section, shortly before Jane and Rochester part for the last time, in which he tells her of the effect she had on him at their first meeting.)  What a romantic and wonderful book, and one that cries out to be a mini-series because so MUCH has been left out of film versions to date (those I've seen, anyway).

One critical reviewer said that the Morton-Hinds version departs most significantly from the book.  I compared word for word the crowning glory of the film for me, the ending, which I find extremely moving and thrilling in that version- brings me to tears and makes me want to cheer at the same time- and yes it does deviate, but again, I believe it is truest in spirit to the OVERALL narrative (which is passionate and dramatic).  But I also like the ending of this version- which includes more actual dialogue from the book.  Bronte is quite matter of fact at the end, so in the strictest sense the ending of this one is truer.  In terms of being true to the end of a book, for me both Jane Eyres are vastly superior and in marked contrast to Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley, in which the film struck me as utterly untrue to BOTH the spirit and marrative of the novel- re: heavy breathing, heaving bosoms, sweat, passion and desire on steroids, NOTHING like Jane Austen's sensibilities.  Bronte, on the other hand, was nothing if not passionate and dramatic.  Those who have loved another utterly will recognize themselves in these characters.  And a secondary theme I love in the narrative is that of love as salvation, that saves both, that engenders ""the better angels"" of their natures (as Abraham Lincoln said).

My own feeling on differing film versions of favorite novels is that each (of the good ones anyway) rounds out the overall experience, fleshes out the book and complements the others.  Rarely does any one production capture all the nuances of a book- a different- deeper and broader- medium, duh.  Mini-series tend to do a better job, of course.  But even so, individual screenwriters, directors and actors bring their own foci and sensibilities to bear on the production.  This has been my experience many times, e.g., with the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-and-South/dp/B016JMT5T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North and South</a>&nbsp;by Bronte's friend Elizabeth Gaskell, both the splendid but low-budget&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/made-for-TV-version-from-the-70s/dp/B00H2QNTBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">made-for-TV version from the 70s</a>&nbsp;with a young Patrick Stewart, which is truer to the events of the book (and for me Stewart IS the iconic Thornton), and the gorgeous, atmospheric&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2004-film/dp/B004EF65QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2004 film</a>, which deviates substantially from the book but is inspired and inspiring nonetheless.  Likewise, for me the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Morton-Hinds-version/dp/B00L8O2QVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Morton-Hinds version</a>&nbsp;of Jane Eyre and this Gainsbourg-Hurt one complement each other very well, I love them both and watch them alternately.

Here's one last excerpt from the book, from their first meeting, which suggests the spark of their personalities (both contrary!) and their instant attraction to each other (captured very well by Gainsbourg and Hurt):

As Jane reports, she's walking along at twilight, and a man on horseback speeds by-
""...only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of What the deuce is to do now? and a clattering tumble arrested my attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.""  She asks him if he's all right, he's rude and tells her to stand aside. She describes his appearance, behavior, and bad humor. He's clearly injured, she offers assistance several times, which he shuns dismissively, and she muses: ""...if this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced  I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.  He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before.""

Mr. Rochester describes this encounter later in the book, before they part for the last time:

""...let me come to the point.  Last January, rid of all [my] mistressesin a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely lifecorroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came back to England.  I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace  no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as negligently as I did the willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life  my genius for good or evil  waited there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of [the] accident, it came up and gravely offered me help. Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped onto my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would NOT go: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.

When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new  a fresh sap and sense  stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf must return to me  that it belonged to my house down below  or I could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or watched for you. The next day I observed you  myself unseen  for half- an- hour , while you played with Adle in the gallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adle claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time.

When at last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet ! There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to say  My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.

You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight. Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence.  [He sensed an] ...unusual... perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  YOU.  I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more.  [And]... I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find it out...

And find out he does!  There's not a wasted word or scene in this film- it succinctly captures the novel's main themes, includes more of Bronte's wonderful prose, and the ending is very satisfying.  HIGHLY recommended.",1516665600,3,17044,5.045340949660836
