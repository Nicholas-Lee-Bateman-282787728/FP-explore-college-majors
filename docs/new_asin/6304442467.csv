Emily Watson is charming/heartbreaking/naive/childlike/honest/painful and so very gifted in the role of Bess, the girl from the small cultish Scottish Presbyterian town who falls in love with and marries an outsider. Her descent into delusion is as stunning as it is wretched.

We watched it on a Saturday night on a whim, because Nic Sheff had mentioned watching it in rehab in his memoir, and we realised it was sitting on our Amazon watch list. The other alternative was Louie, so you can see we were ill-prepared for the weight of this film. Bizarre (but cool, somehow) musical interludes between chapters aside, this film is like slipping slowly off the face of a cliff. I cried (x3). I grabbed for my boyfriend and made him agree (x4) that this was one of the saddest and most disturbing films we had ever seen. I cried again. By the end I felt hollow and sure that the God that she prays to through the film could not exist (or is a total jerk).

876580,4,6304442467,"""Breaking the Waves""(1996) is directed by Lars von Trier (Melancholia, Antichrist) and stars Emily Watson. After reading the other reviews I was expecting something even more devastating. And despite the fact that it is a dark film I think it is the humanity and hope of Emily Watson's character (Bess) that pulls one from the depths, even while her character spirals into inexplicably darker terrain towards the last part of the film as she drags herself through one self created misery after another. Eventually she is rejected by most everyone for her behaviour, including her church and mother. However after she is savagely beaten and laying on a stretcher, she still manages a faint smile as she admits that she may have been wrong about thinking that having sex with any given strange man would magically help her crippled husband. It is perplexing to watch this story about someone who could be so ""good"" and stupidly naive as to take this extremely self-abusive path. And even though it was her husband's request that she try to live out a sexual life without him there is a tragic disconnect between what is his hope for her and her interpretation of how she think he wishes her to live out her life as a sexual being. She tells him tales but it is doubtful he even believes her seemingly fantastic stories as is the case when she tells of her affair with the doctor which he says isn't true, and to which she admits of its falsehood. But from then on it is like a little game that they are playing with one another, each with their own motives, so as to hold onto something that they once had, however given that she actually is playing out these games in real life they have dire consequences for her. It speaks of her misguided and delusional outlook on life which however also serves as her source of inspiration. This story is at once poignant and sad, but somehow always hopeful, despite the misery, right to the very end with its magical ending.",1420934400,,1962,4.624641833810888

876614,5,6304442467,"Though it's a very heavy movie, I recommend seeing it more than once. I find this to be true of many Lars von Trier films - especially Dancer in the Dark and Dogville. It can be frustrating to watch this director put his lead characters through the ringer - you feel helpless and a bit manipulated the first time around. But watching a second time (or seventh time - as I have with this one), with the ending being known, you'll experience in a much different way. Breaking the Waves portrays characters with differing views of spirituality, religion and love and puts them all in an impossible situation. Upon second viewing, it feels more like a parable and the story challenges you to consider your own beliefs, ethics but with an incredible love story to make the whole thing redeemable. It's so well-crafted, you might not even notice how absurd some of the plot turns are - or that von Trier masterfully merged Scandanivan drama with plot elements borrowed from soft core skin flicks. It's a high-wire act with a wallop of an ending.",1412812800,3,1039,4.6521739130434785

876618,4,6304442467,"There may be spoilers.

This is another controversial film by Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier who also co-wrote the screenplay.  It was the first film of Von Trier's that received some attention in the U. S.  It won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes and was the film debut of Emily Watson who also garnered an Oscar nomination.

In the film Watson plays Bess, a ""simple"" woman living in Scotland with her parents and a member of a strict Christian church.  The term ""simple"" is used by von Trier in the movie and by his own account suggesting Bess can function well day to day, but when life gets complicated, she struggles to understand and can become emotionally distraught, sometimes on the verge of a breakdown.  This is a key element in the film.

Bess, a virgin, marries the rugged Jan (Stellan Skarsgard), who works on an oil rig off the coast.  The film is set in the 1970's and is sectioned off by chapters, named by von Trier and begun with some cool pop songs of the day, by artists like Elton John, Rod Stewart and Leonard Cohen.  There is no score or soundtrack beyond those chapter starters.  We see Bess's frailty early on as Jan must depart by helicopter out to the rig for an extended period of time.  His near collapse is bolstered by her dead brother's widow, Dodo (Katrin Cartlidge).  They are best friends and Dodo has pledged to take care of the young Bess.

Bess is not only scarily in love with Jan, and he with her for that matter, but also talks to God.  Literally.  Bess's voice becomes deep and stern in tone when God asks or answers a question.  She has several of these conversations with God which increase after Jan is severely injured on the oil platform and is paralyzed.  Jan, believing he will die and heavily medicated most of the time, suggests that Bess have sex with other men and provide him with the details.  Her conversations with God suggests that He doesn't object.  The inexperienced Bess reluctantly goes along with the suggestion but her inexperience and awkwardness is difficult to watch.  Watson is a marvel in this role, uncomfortable as it at times to watch.  Lars von Trier's films are always complicated, a bit muddled and full of innuendo and metaphors.  This is no exception.  The church the family belongs to is male dominated, exclusionary and full of ancient doctrinaire.  While they bury patrons, those that sin in their eyes, are condemned to Hell.  As Bess continues her wayward ways, believing she can cure Jan, it causes problems for the standing in the church and with her family.

This isn't an easy film to watch at times and will likely leave many viewers frustrated if not angry.  And certainly the ending will have many shaking their head.  But for me it fits the story.  The film isn't perfect.  It is long at 2  hours and uses hand held cameras most of the time.  But there is no denying its impact.",1403222400,4,2876,4.556640625
876619,4,6304442467,"The 90's did many thing to us. They bought us closer to long hair of the English renegades, to that feeling of Bittersweet Symphony playing in our earphones as we walk down the streets of the world, those lockets which were in and having a tattoo meant just a small thing that had your dogs name written on it. Perhaps I never lived these moments but in films, we live on for ever and ever.
Breaking the waves is EPIC lucid dreaming.

Breaking The Waves begins with a very weak protagonist who has no idea what is going on around her. She has probably never seen tv or never seen others behave a certain way and she is always bordering on breaking out into fits of insanity. Her character is always on the edges, you cringe and she'll make you maybe shriek inwardly once or twice as you'll sit gawking at your screen as she has her talk with GOD. I think the most empowering scenes in the film involved her absolutely losing it and then bringing herself back by speaking with GOD.

The acting is solid. The film is ruthless, gutless, the dialogues are spoken without any predictable apology as to whether the viewer will get what is being said or not but the film moves with its body (video) more than audio because it is graphic, engaging and ultimately rewardingly shattering.

I loved it to bits and recommend it as one of the more stoic films you are likely to see in your life.

One of the best films ever created. You won't watch this one again for sure. So you best enjoy your first viewing.",1401667200,2,1498,4.377697841726619

876621,5,6304442467,"It's not unusual for me to watch 10 or more movies per week, especially now that I'm retired. Been a true film fanatic all my life, so friends will ask me what my top 5 or 10 or 100 movies are. Top 100 is fairly easy, but when it comes to Top 5 or 10, I usually have to say I can only provide that if they let me break them down into genres. Nevertheless, if pressed I can come up with my Top 10 or even 5. And it is rare that I have to make room in either of those lists for something new. Well, after watching ""Anti Christ,"" ""Melancholia,"" and ""Nymphomaniac I & II,"" I've started going through all of the films von Trier has made. And of course, I read reviews of every movie I watch, and somewhere along the line, I read a review of ""The English Patient,"" one of my favorites (Top 50 maybe) that mentioned that, although very good, it didn't stand up to ""Breaking the Waves."" Hah, I thought. We'll see. So I rented this, and it instantly took its place into my Top 5 (maybe I'll identify all five someday). This is one of those works of art that literally changed my life. It is transcendent: spiritually, emotionally, artistically, even physically. And Emily Watson's performance was literally out of this world. I wasn't able to sleep for a full day after watching it. I think this movie actually accomplishes what Mel Gibson wanted to do with ""Passion of the Christ"" but failed at so miserably. I'm not a religious person, but I do have a strong sense of the spiritual. My best friend calls me an ""Agnostic with Possibilities."" ""Breaking the Waves confirmed why I hold onto those possibilities. ""Breaking the Waves"" is not an entertainment; it's a life experience, and although I'm interested and at times highly impressed by these other von Trier movies, none of them come anywhere close to ""Breaking the Waves.""",1398470400,14,1819,4.449101796407185

876663,5,6304442467,"Von Trier misogynistic?  Tell that to Emily Watson, Bjork, Catherine Deneuve, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Lauren Bacall, and on, and on  all masochistic shrinking violets, certainly.  Ahem.  How could a woman-hating director attract some of the most creative, boundary-crossing actresses of our day?  This Danish auteur offers actresses roles the likes of which are seldom seen in movies today, roles where the basest and the highest human impulses are thoroughly honored.  They're irreplaceable.

Yes, you must be on von Trier's wavelength to appreciate his genius.  But this doesn't distinguish him from, say, Bergman or Fellini.  Von Trier is plowing the field of a gothic sensibility.  The literary equivalent  also quite controversial  is Flannery O'Connor.  She created characters of dubious mental balance and set them in bizarre, often violent situations, simply because she felt that extremity was the necessary quality of art in our day to awaken deadened souls.  So, von Trier.  His Bess rubs our face in ultimate questions of faith; we can't avoid deciding whether her path is perverse or sanctified, or considering what we would do for love.  Certainly her spirituality has at least as much dignity to it as the desolate sacerdotal obsessions of the church elders, hardened as they are on the anvil of contempt.  And her determination to follow the lead of her love in spite of every obstacle, even unto the gates of hell, overrides any impression of her malleability.  Von Trier's unyielding dedication to melodrama wears us down into a fully conscious submission to his art  if you'll let it.

""Breaking the Waves,"" like virtually every von Trier opus, is perverse, irritating, and brilliant.  You will come through it with your sensibilities twisted and stunned and stretched.  But if you stick with it, you will, at least in some small way, experience a dark, richly colored epiphany.  This is one of my favorite films.  Five stars.  Don't miss it.",1395187200,5,1989,5.179245283018868
876664,5,6304442467,"Emily Watson gives a performance so astonishing, so breathtaking, so overwhelming that it will arguably be rated as the greatest film performance ever recorded on celluloid in the history of motion pictures by anyone who is knowledgeable about cinema.  She is powerful beyond all comprehension in Breaking the Waves and she will simply sear your very flesh, tear out your heart, and clutch your soul in her hand by the conclusion of the film.  Indeed, you will sob uncontrollably through a great deal of the movie, laugh uncomfortably through parts, and gape open-mouthed at what you are witnessing during some scenes.  Never before has any actor given of herself so completely to her art, pummeling the viewer with her brilliance and leaving audiences staggered by the enormity of her stunning gifts.  This is an actress who is the most talented thespian of our time in any medium and this film, while not to everyone's taste, is a showcase for her genius.  That she was denied the Academy Award for this role renders the Oscars completely meaningless and to be totally disregarded.  In order to grasp the incredible beauty of Emily Watson's work in Breaking the Waves, one must experience it for themselves because there are no words to describe what she does.  She redefines the word actor and will forever overshadow all others in the profession, not simply through this film in particular but in role after role after role.  She shines like the most brilliant star in the heavens and audiences are blessed to bask in the glow of her art.  Once she takes you with her on her amazing journey in this motion picture, you will never be the same again.  No one can see her in Breaking the Waves and not be changed.

The film makers realizing, I suppose, the absurdity of that premise are forced into making the wife, Bess, insane, as if to say a woman would have to be insanely in love with her husband to have sex with other men just because he asked her to.  [Trier must lead a very sheltered life.]  Film is a visual medium, so when a blurb tells me that the wife is going to have sex with numerous men, I expect to see said sex--there is none.  There is only one very brief non-sexual nude scene.  And finally, the movie ends clumsily.  Bess goes on board a ship to allow sadists to, ostensibly, rape and torture her--off camera, of course--yet when she is taken to a hospital, on the verge of death, she is still fully clothed just as when she boarded the ship.

It's incoherent and pointless.  It's just a sick Sirk-like (as in Douglas Sirk) melodrama that changes tone somewhere in the middle, as the director apparently likes to do.  It's adds up to nothing and it seems rather obvious that this writer/director wouldn't have it any other way - he makes smirking little facsimilies of art products, not actual art products.  This is like a bad parody of Fassbinder's take on Sirk's movies.

The lead actors are great, and Von Trier is technically just fine as a screenwriter and as a director.  But don't be fooled into thinking that he's furthering cinema in some way with movies like this.

876729,5,6304442467,"One of the best films of 1996, this is a story of love that knows no boundaries, and of sacrifice. Emily Watson gives the performance of her career as Bess, a simple woman who has just married Jan, played by Stellan Skarsgard. Within the boundaries of their marriage, Bess discovers the gift of physical love that she had never known before. From this moment on, she cannot bear to be away from her husband and constantly cries when he is away. Bess is also a devout Christian, and is always praying to God, asking him questions and turning to him for comfort.

When Jan is the victim of a tragic oil rig accident that leaves him paralyzed, he is no longer able to make love to Bess. He then asks her to do something very sketchy: he asks her to go out and make love with perfect strangers, and then come to him with all of the details. His motivations for this seem sort of strange, and it is never quite clear why he asks her to do this. However, being the simpleton and the loving individual that she is, she fulfills what he asks her to do. In her mind, she believes that it is her duty as a wife, and so she becomes something of a prostitute. She believes that her actions will heal her husband. As a result of her promiscuous behavior, she is cast out of her church and abandoned by her family. The children throw rocks at her, and the townsfolk want nothing to do with her. All she has from this point on are God, her husband, and her overly protective best friend. Still, she presses on with her mission, which she believes is God's will for her life. It all leads to a tragic - yet extremely powerful - ending.

While I do not believe for one second that God would ask one of his children to sacrifice themselves in that fashion, that really is not the point of this film. Lars Von Trier has given us a strong message here. Bess puts her love and her life on the line, just as Christ did for all of humanity. See this film and try to look beyond the disturbing, graphic material to see the bigger picture. When I first read about this film - being a fan of Lars Von Trier's work - I was extremely reluctant to view it.

876796,5,6304442467,"What a powerful cinematic experience!  BREAKING THE WAVES, directed by the always-controversial Lars von Trier, explores the concepts of love and faith with more poignancy and more intensity than any other film that I can think of.

The movie opens with Bess (Emily Watson) trying to justify to the elders of her church why she should be allowed to marry Jan, a comparatively worldly outsider.  Bess is from a very small and insulated Scottish community, and the church she belongs to is VERY conservative and traditional (not to mention patriarchical).  It is with some reluctancy that the old bearded men finally approve her marriage.

Although Bess is not quite as rigidly backward as the church elders, she is a deeply faithful woman.  In fact, as the film progresses, the purity of Bess's religious beliefs transforms her into a saintly, if not Christ-like character.

Next to Bess's devotion to God (perhaps even surpassing it), is her devotion to Jan.  Bess loves her husband completely, unquestioningly, almost madly.  In fact, Bess is at first hesitant to tell her husband how deeply she cares for him, for fear that he will be angry with her for the intensity of her feelings.  Fairly early on in the film (and I don't think I'm revealing too much by saying so), Jan is severely injured in an oil-rigging accident.  This is when Bess's love for him is put to the test in surprising and frankly disturbing ways.

As with any Lars von Trier film, BREAKING THE WAVES is not for the faint of heart.  The story is difficult, and there is a lot of frank sexuality.  I think any thoughtful viewer, though, will recognize that this film is far from an exploitive shock-piece.  After viewing it for the first time the other night, I found myself (and I'm not religious, by the way) contemplating some profoundly spiritual questions.  What does it mean to love unconditionally?  Do any of us really have pure faith, or are we all too jaded?  Why was it necessary for Christ to sacrifice himself to save us?  Is this morbid, or is it the ultimate demonstration of love?

The film is generally heavy, but there are also several light moments.  One of the most delightful aspects of the film is Emily Watson's performance.  While the acting was excellent across the board, I couldn't take my eyes off of her face.  I was reminded of Giulietta Masina in LA STRADA.  Both actresses are extraordinarily expressive and have a sort of wide-eyed naivety that breaks your heart.  Actually, I believe the similarities between the two roles extend beyond the actresses' facial expressions, but I'll leave that for you to contemplate.  First, you've got to watch this movie.  I highly recommend that you do so.",1165795200,13,2697,4.806521739130435
876797,5,6304442467,"Breaking The Waves is quite possibly one of the best, and most powerful film of the 90's. It is considered one of the films in the Dogme movement started by Danish filmmakers including this film's director, Lars Von Trier. The Dogme movement was started in 1995, and is a set of rules, that director's can follow which allows the filmmaking to be at it's purest for cheapest, with no special effect and no big budget, this allows the filmmakers to focus more on the story and the actor's involvement with their characters. Although this is not a proper Dogme film, it does follow some of the other rules Lars Von Trier vowed to keep. This is Emily Watson's first feature film and definately is one of her finest roles to date. She achieved an acadamy award nomination for best actress as the leading character Bess, and the film also won the grand jury award at the Cannes Film Festival, along with best film of the year at the european film awards. The film was written by Lars Von Trier, Peter Asmussen, and the uncredited David Pirie.

Breaking The Waves is set in the early 1970's and is about a faithful young woman named bess, who lives in a small town in Scotland. Bess is a very faithful person towards her religon and has a previous mention of being at a psychiatric hospital. At the beginning of the film, Bess is confronting the townsmen who are incharge of the church she attends and is asking their permission to marry an oil rig worker named Jan, who is played by Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgrd. After Bess and Jan get married, Jan has to go back, and Bess' world ends once he leaves to go back and work at the oil rig. Bess' caretaker and sister in law Dodo, encourages her to live a normal life while he's away, and that she shouldn't just stop living. Jan phones his wife every day and doesn't neglect her. Bess prays for her husband to come home, although he would be returning to her in ten days, she can't wait that long, and prays for him to come home immediatly. Jan has a fatal accident at the rig and forces him to come home to attend the hospital. Bess soon finds out from the doctor who's a good friend of her's that he's parralized for life. She soon starts to feel guilty that her beloved is parralized because of her, that she prayed for her husband to return quickly, and thinks that she caused the accident to happen. Jan realises that he can't ever touch or make love to his wife again, and encourages her to find a lover and tell him every detail so that he can never forget what it feels like. Both of them are deeply in love, and Jan pleads her to help him never forget, so that he, as he claims, may still live. Bess beleives that this whole fiasco is a test of her love for him.

The key highlight of the picture is Emily Watson's truly amazing performance, and is one of the main reasons you should watch this film. But, there is not one poor performance in this film by any actor.  Skarsgrd is absolutely sensational as the crippled Jan, and gives a very detailed and heart breaking performance alongside Emily Watson. Other brilliant performances come from Katrin Cartlidge as the nurse Dodo and sister in-law to Bess, and as well as Adrian Rawlins as the caring Docter Richardson. Von Trier is known to be hard on his cast, but is rewarded with truly heartfelt performances from the cast and excellent direction. The cinematography is what you expect from any Dogme film(one of the rules is to only use handheld cameras), the handheld camera gives us the personal and intimate moments of the characters, it's not only stylish and unique, but it also gives us a feeling that we are one of the characters in the film, that we are a spectator of the events that are taking place, and that we are in their heads, that we are experiencing what they are feeling at that precise moment. The film features an exilarating 1970's rock soundtrack, that has mostly glam rock, the music is only played at the introduction of each new chapter, and only once, during actual footage, T-Rex's rollicking Hot Love. The script is very well thought out, and very meaningful dialogue with heart pounding story.

Overall, Breaking The Waves is a definate knock-out, and rightly deserves the praise it got from critics and cinema goers. But, it isn't for the average movie watcher and would only appeal to avid Von Trier fans and art house viewers. The film should most definately not be missed by anybody who is looking for a tale filled with love and faith. The end result is one of the most powerful films of all time and one of the most depressing films ever. The ending is an absolute tragic event and gets all of the character's emotions thrown at us with devestating results. This and Requiem For A Dream are possibly the most powerful films and saddest films I've ever seen. This is a very tough second viewing, and won't reccomend to the sensetive viewer. The film contains explicit sex, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. But, for everybody else, a film to see on a cold rainy day, infact, any time of the day will do.

There are absolutely no special features on the region 1 disc, I own the region 2 disc, it hardly has anything extra, but specialy selected chapters with comentary from Lars Von Trier and other crew involved. The film: 4.5/5 The extras: 2.5/5(R2), 0/5(R1)",1154908800,8,5315,4.532291666666667

Afterwards, things definitely don't stick to an standard plotline.

876802,4,6304442467,"Breaking the waves was a sad, fantastic, unrealistic film with fine acting by Emily Watson and costars. Trouble is the film's faulty premise that abundant love no matter how misguided overcomes all.

In real life such all consuming love is self serving, loving to be loved back, and suffocating to most recipients. Such love in real life invites abuse, abandonment, and eventual scorn from the massive egos created by the backfiring love. The husband and friends portrayed in this film unrealistically accept, adorn, and appreciate this love instead.

So are we to believe Bess' love was pure or Christ like that this love had a different effect on people? Was it the director's intent to make us believe so with the bells ringing at the end of the film? No Bess was mentally and emotionally ill. Afer all Christ didn't cry every two minutes over some trivial incident.

So do the mentally ill go to heaven. Doubt it! Most mentally ill cause as much or more suffering to their family and friends as they suffer themselves. The husband and friends of Bess suffered alot because of her - that part of the film was true. So why should she go to heaven?

876879,4,6304442467,"The reviewer below says she was offended as a devout Catholic. I'm a devout believer in Christ, as well, and understand why the sex scenes and the degradation the character endures are offputting.  Stop to consider, though, that the story, whether the director intended it or not (and it's so obvious, he must have intended it), puts the main character in there as a Christ figure. She lets herself be abused and killed for the sake of love and to ""save"" another, her husband. Sound familiar?

Bess's character reminds me of the Scriptural teachings on how believers must come to God as little children--trusting, open--and that what's in our heart matters to God. He sees the heart, not just the outward pieties.  Bess is a guiless woman and a gentle dimwit. She's ""stupid"", she says and others accept. But in her foolishness, she nevertheless has ongoing dialogues with the Creator, who let her be born thusly. When she does evil things (the promiscuous sex), she does them out of a childlike impulse of faith and a good motive (healing). (The opposite of the Pharisees, btw, who were told off by Christ for doing their good acts out of selfish and prideful motives and with hard hearts, trusting in their own holy actions, rather than standing humbly before a gracious and merciful God who sanctifies those who trust wholly in Him.)

There is a moving and well-done scene during an inquest. They're trying to decide on Bess' state of mind to understand her actions. What the doctor originally wrote about her had to do with ""psychotic"" and ""neurotic"" and a compulsion to perverse sexual acts. The doctor says he would rewrite his opinion, and he would say about her that she was... ""good."" This stuns the judges. ""Good?"" And it's an awkward moment for everyone there, even the doctor who is struggling to understand exactly the nature of Bess and her actions. It's a fascinating moment of insight. Earlier in the film, Bess herself mentions Mary Magdalene, who though a prostitute by traditional accounts, went on to become, as Bess says, ""beloved"" of God.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!

It's no surprise, then, that as Christ had to die, brutally, abused at the hands of those who couldn't perceive his goodness and mission, Bess, the suffering-servant-savior type here, dies as well, misunderstood by the community, labeled a ""sinner"" and damned by the elders of her very strict Scottish sect. Interestingly, her grave is empty.(Hear the gospel echoes?)Her husband, with the aid of his colleagues, steals her body to bury it at sea.

Bess's death has not been useless. It has powerful effects: illumination in the doctor who loved her and the friend who tried to guide her, and divine healing to her dying husband. We, the viewer, are shown in no uncertain terms, that heaven is pleased with Bess's faith, love and sacrifice (if not her methodology). The bells of heaven ring miraculously over the oil rig where Bess's widower stands listening. We know her soul is in Paradise.

The reason why this is shortened is because of the strict censorship rules in South Korea.  Why this DVD has been advertised as uncut here and on Ebay remains a mystery.  The cuts don't necessarily hurt the story, but then again there are the staunch filmgoers (like me) who prefer to see the film the way a director intended it.

It also kind of hurts that there are no English subtitles on this DVD, and it plays without sound.  The audio track on your DVD player has to be changed to hear anything.

His wife Bess now must do everything possible to get him out of his coma.  Even if that means acting against her strong religious Christian faith.  Jan requests that she sleeps with other men to help save him and so she can still feel pleasure like it's he giving it to her.  Miraculously, revolutions with his health start occurring.  However, Bess's reputation is in jeopardy.

Danish director Lars von Trier, also known for 2000's ""Dancer In the Dark"" starring Bjork, is well known for creating films that entail someone who acts terribly or against their morals to save their loved ones.  Those acts become heroic.  Beyond the low-budget camera work are some of the most heartwrenching stories known to cinema.  This effect allows the story to express itself more emotionally without any distractions.  ""Breaking the Waves"" is no acception.  He proves that films do not need fancy effects to be eyeopening.  His unique work unfortunately remains overlooked.

""Breaking the Waves"" amazingly maintains its emotional value throughout the film.  This acceptional plot distinguishes the love story and the heroism beautifully.  It deeply explores the characters' backgrounds and emotions, which shares why this story reaches such emotional levels.  Despite the sexual acts not being acceptable in society, Trier amazingly maintains the heroism theme without labeling Bess as unfaithful.  The storyline creativity is beyond imaginable.  This is one of those few films that successfully maintains audience interest with mostly dialect and little action.

Emily Watson received her first Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her role as Bess.  Her remarkable talents express the film's emotional value to unimaginable levels.  She was truly one of the best actresses of 1996.  Her research of the character was revalent.  Her challenging performance never loses it touch, considering almost every scene is difficult acting.  Though all the other actors performed will, Watson's performance states itself the highest.

Those looking for an emotional film should watch ""Breaking the Waves"".  This is sure to please many audiences.  Lars von Trier's other films are recommended to those who love this film.",1116892800,8,2494,5.2748091603053435

It is the best example (in film) about the gospel of love. Forget the Passion of the Christ, this movie, more than that one by Gibson, best exemplifies the words caritas and agape. It is as if Von Trier took the first book, 13th chapter of Corinthians in the New Testament and built a film around it. Bess is a living saint, and in the end beatified.

It is the finest example of love in cinema. Now buy it and see it.",1103241600,6,539,4.084905660377358

876887,5,6304442467,"A very moving film on true religion: unconditional love.

Jan loves that slightly mentally retarded but attractive and lovable young lady Bess, also he is very interested in sex. Bess warm-heartedly loves him so much back, disregarding all the obstacles his profession implies working away on an oil platform for long times. Both are strong in their trust in each other, they do not bother about arrogant hypocrits being envious of their innocent happiness.

Then after an accident which leaves Jan in bed paralyzed probably for the rest of his life, Bess does not leave him, though he is rather rude in his depression.

He begs her to have sex with others, so that he can accept her staying with him as he cannot satisfy her in that respect anymore, sex being so important in his male imagination and self esteem, not so much for her, however. First she does not feel it necessary. Then, just for him, she really gives her body away, playing prostitute, a sacrifice for her love to him, telling him about her adventures, so that he can live that lost part of life in his imagination.

But being prostitute is tough and dangerous, she gets hurt, but still works on, though in the end she is even killed.

""Nobody has more love as someone who gives his life for a fellowman"". This is the heart of religion, not living strict man-made rules that strangle soul and body alike, but believing in love, so that heaven touches earth, simple people may be transformed into something greater, which violence and death cannot stop (and thus leave me crying...-)",1100563200,2,1551,4.708487084870849

876946,5,6304442467,"This is the story about love.  Everyday we experience this breathtaking emotion with both inanimate objects and with other souls.  It is when we finally find true love that nothing else in the world seems worthy or good.  We work as hard as we can to continue this warmth that we feel in our hearts when true love exists, and sometimes that means going to a level we never thought imaginable.

That is the central theme of Lars von Trier's epic, Breaking the Waves.  Love has no boundaries as we watch Bess do everything possible (and more) to keep the relationship with her husband together during the roughest of times.  Emily Watson controls the character Bess giving her best performance ever.  The emotion and serenity that is felt, not only behind the character of Bess, but also behind Watson's eyes is phenomenal.  It is not often that Hollywood is able to capture this sort of raw emotion, but Watson pulled it off with incredible talent.

Outside of Watson's character, there is the story.  Lars von Trier does a spectacular job of continually building on the foundation that he has begun.  Watson is his foundation, and Trier builds this amazing world around her.  In this film, everything from talking to God to reverberating stories to her husband while he is in the hospital only helps build the story to even higher heights.  I will be honest; I shed tears at the end of this film.  It will pull at every heart muscle that you have and really make you look at your significant other and truly feel the power of love.

This is a love story, but not like one we have seen in a very long time.  I don't think we will see anything similar to this again.  It will be hard for Hollywood to emulate such raw talent, groundbreaking direction, and life-changing story.

Thank you Lars von Trier for your imagination and passion for love.

As you can see this little speech can give you an idea about the relevant meaning of this powerful film of Lars von Triers who shows once more his enormous talent, following the glorious heritage of Carl Dreyer , the most important dannish film maker ever .

In this case , the film deals with a complex drama as the background . Inmersed in the real essence of the most ravishing puritanism and sense of religious behavior , Bess and Jan get marry .

But the film is not about them, it is about Bess, and about her love for God and God's love for her. What happens to her in the movie is not God's torture of her, it is human free will being exercised on a pure spirit, and the beauty is how her spirit always remains pure. That is why God loves Bess. God does not sugarcoat the world, and all who wish to follow him go through trials. Bess made it through those trials, and this is, as such, a TRUE CHRISTIAN FILM.
Not to mention it is cinematically the best film I have ever seen, as Heilman says, it is transcends words and descriptions. Do not let any review scare you away, if you don't like graphic sex turn it off, but this is a film about the love God has for all the how beautiful a pure spirit is.",1087516800,3,903,4.078651685393258

The movie is at times beautiful and at times clearly an exercise in self-indulgence on the part of the director, Lars von Trier. What I found absolutely inexcuseable was the final, very final shot. Without giving the ending away, hearing the bells was beautiful. It was transcendant. It made up for the length and leisurely pace of the whole movie.

876950,5,6304442467,"Bess McNeil (Emily Watson) is a naive woman who was brought up in an oppressive environment with patriarchal Christian believes where Christian rules are worshipped above all else.  Nonetheless, Bess gets the Church elders approval, after some hesitation, to marry an outsider.  This outsider is Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsgrd), an oil rig worker on the North Sea.  Bess and Jan are so much in love that Bess declares her love for Jan in the bathroom of their reception by saying ""You can love me now!"", which leads to Bess loosing her virginity.  This is the beginning of her sexual transformation as her love expands for Jan and in appreciation she thanks God for the gift of love that he has given her.  However, the honeymoon must come to an end as Jan must return to the oil rig to earn a living.  On the oil rig Jan is seriously injured in an accident, which leads the audience into a relentlessly tragic story about faith, loss, and love.
Breaking the Waves is broken up in different chapters and in between the chapters von Tier uses scenic shots that are artistically enhanced.  These shots cue the audience on the upcoming chapter as it deals with different issues around Bess and Jan's relationship.  The film is shot in a Dogma 95 style that von Tier introduced to the public in 1995, which adds to the realism of the story.  In addition, the cast performs brilliantly as they help paint the true vision of Lars von Tier in a brilliant cinematic experience that some will love and some will hate as the story forces the audience to choose a side.",1082937600,44,1555,4.605072463768116
876951,4,6304442467,"The subject of this daringly emotional movie is faith, and it demands to be taken on. Von Trier's blurb on the DVD has him suggesting that this was a simple love story, but it absolutely isn't. It may be set among a simple people, but the questions it raises will have you thinking for a while.
FIRST HALF: MARVELLOUS
In a bleak Scottish village dominated by a rigid Christian sect with a profound distrust of outsiders, a childlike god-fearing young woman named Bess marries an oil-rig worker named Jan, a hearty, worldly sensualist. They hurl themselves into marriage with a reckless, carnal joy that is unnerving to behold.
This first half of the movie contains some of the most passionate mosaic of love scenes I have seen in a while. Von Trier, together with cinematographer Mueller, creates an atmosphere of dizzying immediacy and evokes some vivid performances from the actors.
SECOND HALF: MIXED BAG
After all that wondrous love, the film suddenly takes a bizarre dip when the husband gets paralyzed and fears that he will never be able to make love to his wife again. So he asks her to find a lover and tell him the details about it, as a vicarious sexual existence. He tells her that this is the only way he can live, and without it, he will die. She refuses, but when his condition worsens, she ultimately succumbs.
This bit I felt is where the film comes a tad undone. While it is VERY moving to watch, I began to question the leaps of faith we are supposed to take, as this strange mix of religion and sexuality smacks either of being too simplistic or too far-fetched. The husband's notions of depraved sexuality as salvation come across as illogical and ineffective.
BUT, SO WHAT, IT'S A MUST-WATCH GEM:
Despite my gripes, this is a fascinating film to watch (and own!) I have seen very few movies that take such huge risks, it is absolutely high-wire filmmaking, without a net of irony. Like the movie, the performances of the stars will surely leave you shaken, off balance, haunted.",1081814400,8,2000,4.668555240793201
876952,5,6304442467,"Please do not get me wrong: Trier means most of the things he says with this movie: and he is propably one of the 9 greatest filmmakers in history. I am just not sure that people realize how much this movie is a rebellion against certain turgid, self - important elements in Danish culture. He uses clich&egrave;s and sentimentality to express ideas that are quite complex and clever: and even passionate. Its something Danes usually do not admit to be, but are actually quite good at: just look at that other Danish catholic convert, Niels Steensen.
(Not that i am that much for Catholicism, but it does make for some fine stories).
Two minor points:
1): I know people might ""blank it out"" due to ingrained stereotypes (""Footlose"" was a charming movie, but its theme mayhave become slightly, well, over - used?): Triers main villains are NOT the Presbytarians: he establishes their supiriority to id - driven types pretty early on in the movie (its the ""liberated"" types who end up killing the main character too, come to think of it).
2): no, the movie is not ""misogynist"": yes, she actually knows what shes doing. People do, sometimes: even women (though a lot of people seem not to think so).",1081641600,3,1196,4.7
876953,5,6304442467,"Child-like, devout, not quite right in the head, Bess gets married to Jan and is immensely happy. When he has to return to the oil rig where he works, she is devastated and prays to God for him to come home. And so he does, on a stretcher, after a serious accident at work has paralysed him. Now it is guilt that devastates Bess. Jan meanwhile begins to have some, ultimately well-intentioned, thoughts that she should free herself up from him, taking a lover perhaps, as he has little prospect of ever making love to her again. She won't hear of it. So now he urges her to do this not for herself but for him. And indeed, his own mental balance shaken by his physical condition, he places the thought in her head that by having sex with other men she can somehow help him to recovery. The deadly seriousness with which she takes this makes her an outcast in her small Highland community and leads to her ultimate destruction.
This film is set in the Scottish Highlands. Film lovers the world over, hearing that, may immediately think of the rather fey, whisky-soaked and carefree landscape of ""I Know Where I'm Going"", ""Whisky Galore"", ""Local Hero"", etc. If you do, now is the time to forget these cosy images. The Highlands here are a cold, difficult place where small inward-looking communities are dominated by the ministers of a cold and unforgiving Presbyterian faith and where, out in the harbour, in the ""big boat"" there lurks a lawless and dangerous world of psychopathic sexual sadism. It's a bleak picture indeed though I doubt that von Trier intends it to be a particularly realistic picture of a Highland community. The brutality and ugliness of Bess's environment is simply intended to represent the brutality and ugliness of the world quite generally and indeed von Trier may intend a certain irony in providing his story with a setting so often viewed as a place of escape from such things. (Despite this setting, von Trier's first English language film remains also unmistakably Danish and reviewers who profess to see here the strong influences both of Soren Kierkegaard and of Carl Dreyer are surely dead right.)
Two things destroy Bess. One is her love for her husband twisted into madness by her grief and mental weakness. The other is the unforgiving cruelty of her community who, at a moment in her life when she most needs their compassion and understanding, turn their back on her with freezing contempt in spite of their ostensible adherence to a religion of love and forgiveness. In horrible scenes late in the film, Bess's mother shuts her out of her house; she is chased, jeered at and stoned in the street by the local schoolchildren; the local minister (a great chilling performance by Jonathan Hackett) finds her unconscious at the church door and simply walks away. This lost and hopelessly corrupted world fails, in von Trier's eyes, adequately to see that the love and goodness embodied in Bess, for all her innocence and self-destructive foolishness, offers it its sole hope of redemption. Unmistakably this is a profoundly religious film, the work of a director who recently before converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism. But it is a religious movie that is certain  to - and I have no doubt is purposefully designed to - shock and distress most religious viewers.
Indeed, in a whole bunch of ways, it will shock and distress just about anybody. The events of the second half of the movie are profoundly harrowing, disturbing and painful to watch. (Not least because Emily Watson turns in a performance so brilliant that it is very easy to forget we are only watching someone acting.) And it is hard viewing. Though not officially a Dogme95 film, it goes a good distance in respecting that school's self-denying ordinances in favour of location shooting, hand-held camera work, lack of incidental music (except here for the occasional ""chapter"" headings accompanied by 70s style rock music), etc. But none of this prevents it from being an extraordinarily compelling, altogether unique movie, one that nobody who cares about good cinema should even think about missing out on.",1077148800,3,4118,4.857752489331436
876954,4,6304442467,"My first experience with Lars Von Trier was Dancer in the Dark which was intentionaly lacking in production values and minimalist acting.  There is truly a connection between these two films. The heroine is very naive and simple, but sweet and powerfully convicted and emotional about her goal in life. Both are faced with making a profound sacrifice for someone they love. But unlike Dancer in the Dark which decidedly dark, this film is more optimistic and magical almost to a Spielbergian degree. You have to ride through the entire film to understand. But it all ties together in a lovely way.
I quite loved this film and considering that it is filled with mental illness, sex, perversions, and disfunctional religious relationships it ends up being very endearing and sentimental in a way not quite unlike a Capra film like It's a Wonderful Life.
So if you tend to dislike arthouse films this might be one you would like. Its very disturbing while at the same time leaving you with a good feeling. I was caught offguard by this film's willingness to entertain the whimsical when its seems so tragic.

Bess, beautifully portrayed by Emily Watson, is a completely naive yet totally sexual human being who literally lives for the man she loves.  Despite the fact that she becomes a prostitute, you have no problem seeing her as a heroine and the church elders as villains.  Her faith in God, her willingness to give of her self and her ultimate downfall make her small character appear bigger than life.
Stallan Skarsgard exudes sexuality and sensitivity, but does not come off as the manly yet sensitive charicature we have come to expect from movies.  Like Bess, and like us all, he is very multi-faceted.  He loves his wife dearly, and in fact tolerates with much good nature her child like ways, but battles his own demon when faced with paralysis.  Despite the vile request he makes of her, it is impossible to dislike him.
The symbolism shown in the frigid waters, the unyielding sea and the church reach our very soul.  The musical interludes between each chapter serve to further grab at your heart.
There are no heros and villains in this movie.  Just honest humans who we come to understand and grieve for.  This movie will stay in your heart for ever, provided it finds the depth it needs.",1069632000,4,1272,4.647321428571429
877048,5,6304442467,"""Breaking the Waves"" is certainly as far away from the Hollywood movie etiquette as you will likely get for a film of its class. Mainstream movie viewers would do well to avoid like the plague. It has all the hallmarks of a bad production - terrible shaky camerawork, bad lighting, non-linear plot line, disjointed editing and low-budget all to the tune of a 70s soundtrack. The fact is that this is the film that birthed a new type of independent movie that uses film making standards ""now known as Dogme with some revised areas"" to approach film making from a new perspective. ""Breaking the Waves"" is not Dogme but did get that whole concept up and running. There is an overall air that the film makers are there on the scene, making a sort of documentary which can be distracting for many but this is what the films sets out to achieve. It almost resembles a Reality TV type of show.
Basically the film is set in the 1970s in the northwest coast of Scotland. Bess, (Emily Watson) is a shy quite girl with frustrating sexual and psychological problems who marries Jan (Stellan Skarsgard) an oilrig worker which is not entirely appreciated by her family and friends. He leaves to go back to the offshore rig and she is left alone to spend the days without him. Basically there in an accident which leaves Bess seeking out other men which she has sexual relationships with to help her come to terms with the accident. There is a real shock ending twist and the film does surprise.
All in all this is advanced art filmmaking with a great performances. Just remember that there are a lot of new film making concepts involved in this film and it does have a massive running time of 2hrs and 30mins. The film is also strong in sex, language and can be quite violent at times. Only for brave movie lovers who really want to see a great film that challenges the movie system with hyper-realism.

The bleak northern reaches of coastal Scotland are a perfect match for the 'single camera, no set, no artificiality' style of von Trier and the Dogma mandate...
You can also check out two other good Dogma offerings in 'Mifune' and 'Italian for Beginners.'  Both worth your while.

877052,2,6304442467,"This review is somewhat biased, because I generally prefer films that move faster and take less time to establish the characters than this one (call me brainwashed by modern Hollywood cinema, but this is how I feel).
I appreciate Lars von Trier's effort to establish Bess (Emily Watson) and Jan (Stellan Skarsgaard) as unique characters, but the film ultimately fails because of its slow pace. Unlike other films that have desperate characters (the mindless ""Rules of Attraction"" comes to mind), I feel what Bess does is justified, given her husband's inexplicable request and the extremely conservative nature of her church. These characters (and the performances) breed empathy and compassion; von Trier's skill and the actors' talent are much evident. However, I honestly could not sit through the entire film without hitting my DVD player's Fast Forward button several times, and finally stopping the movie early because I could take the sluggish pace no longer. Forty percent of the movie could be cut, and the story would suffer none.
My other gripe about this film is the pointless and unnerving ""chapter"" stops which occur every fifteen minutes throughout the movie. While the film itself plays with mostly no background music, the eight or so chapter marks last way too long. Furthermore, loud rock music plays during these segments, which breaks the mood of the film, making the otherwise quiet film very noisy. These chapter segments inappropriately disrupt the flow of the film, and had me scrambling for my remote control several times to turn down the volume.
If the film could be re-edited without the protracted and inappropriate ""chapter"" segments (or even if the disturbing, loud rock music could be removed), then it might be tolerable.",1039910400,7,1755,5.161403508771929
877053,5,6304442467,"Where do I even start with this insane movie that I can't even believe got released? One thing I'd like to stress first is just what a great parallel to ""Dancer in the Dark"" it is. The two characters Bess and Selma are extremely different from one another yet they both share a common bond of simply being incredibly ""good"". ""Breaking the Waves"" is primarily about sex and God, whereas in ""Dancer in the Dark"" God never gets mentioned and there's not even sexual tension, the focus being on motherhood and a beautiful kind of introspection. Bess talks to God on a regular basis, Selma has no one to talk to. But damned if they're not exactly like each other! Anyway, if you pay attention while watching this movie you'll notice just how much care and precision went into every scene, every single camera shot. It's almost creepy because you really do feel like Von Trier is trying to work his way into your brain, in a way that's very subtle but all the more disturbing for that reason. I think the people who give negative reviews to this movie do so because they don't understand that it's just a really simple story whose main focus is on how f---ed up the world is and how good people - the best among us -  tend to be misunderstood and cast aside. I mean, do you really think someone's going to spend five years making a movie that makes fun of its protagonist? Just watch it again and don't assume you know what the director is doing. It's a lot easier to say ""Oh, that was a stupid movie because it's sentimental"" than to empathize with characters who endure things that most people would let break them.",1039910400,7,1611,4.4425675675675675
877054,4,6304442467,"How you react to Lars von Trier's epic love story will depend largely on your response to Bess (Emily Watson).  If you attribute her strikingly self-destructive personal faith to the unfortunate combination of mental imbalance, a brutal Calvinist upbringing, and a life of limited scope, then you're likely to feel enough sympathy for her to turn this story into a heartbreaking masterpiece on the redemptive power of love.  But if, on the other hand, you attribute her behaviour to an irritatingly irrational religious enthusiasm bordering on willful stupidity, then you're likely to find her cloying naivet - and the rest of this film - almost entirely unwatchable.

Coming back to it a day later, and paying more attention, I found Bess far more sympathetic and began to appreciate this film for its craft as much as for its themes.  Lars von Trier's ""dogmatic"" approach doesn't always play, but here it pays off in spades: hand-held cameras and available light add realism to a story and characters which might otherwise seem woefully contrived.  Moreover, the documentary style contrasts wonderfully with the evocative beauty and music of the ""chapter title"" inserts and the glorious, climactic epiphany.  For my money, von Trier's ""Dancer In The Dark"" is a more successful effort, but this one still packs a mighty emotional punch.",1039046400,4,1451,5.046025104602511
877055,2,6304442467,"This movie impressed me in such a negative way I feel that
I must write a review. I have certainly noticed that about 7/8 out
of 10 reviews I've seen are quite positive. Movies are very powerful
and evocative, and what rankles me no end is that crass movies like
this play on cheap emotions and sympathies about how we are all
victims, how life is so unfair, and thus we must feel compassion for
the less fortunate who martyr themselves for (among other things) ""love,""
no matter how outrageous their actions are.
  There was a movie that came out some years ago about a millionaire
who offers a desperate couple a million dollars if he can have an affair
with the wife. The promoters of the movie were able to create a small
stir, really a bunch of gossip - should they or shouldn't they accept
the offer? Fortunately I never saw the movie because the idea struck me
as nonsense, the bait of money that ""everyone"" supposedly wants, etc.
And just like the other movie mentioned above, I see that ""Breaking the
Waves"" has also caused a stir among professional and non-professional
reviewers. Is the love of the lead character, Bess, so pure that she
becomes a Mary Magdalene-like prostitute to satisfy the ""inner needs"" of
her paralyzed husband, and thus, as she believes, keeps him alive? Or is
she so innocent because she is somewhat feeble-minded, and thus the
""victim"" of the hypocritical church elders (incl. her grandfather), who
predictably excommunicate her, which results in her being cast out by
her own family, and hastens her demise.
  The handling of these issues in ""Breaking the Waves"" is trite,
unbelievable, and as I wrote above, the movie very disingenuously and with
amazingly exaggerated self-importance plays on human sympathies about
so-called ""love."" One of the biggest problems with the movie that contributes
to its negative effect is that almost the entire footage is done with close-ups.
The constant close-ups are annoying on TV; on the big scene I can only imagine
what the effect would have been! The constant close-ups force a reaction, scene
after scene, for almost the entire 2 1/2 hours.
  The first hour of the movie, like many European movies, really drags for
a viewer accustomed to American movies. While sometimes the slower pace creates
a richness of plot and character development, here it only underscores the weak
themes and characterizations in the movie and foreshadows later events that are
easily predicted. The final travesty is the quick wrap-up at the end, when
Bess supposedly ""martyrs"" herself (it is so contrived I was aghast when I saw
the scene) and then with no explanation at all her husband is suddenly healed,
and then we are expected to believe that she goes to heaven and ""manifests""
church bells above the oil rig where he works!
  A real tragedy of ""Breaking the Waves"" is that some very fine performances
are almost totally wasted. The actors who play Bess's sister-in-law and the
young, concerned doctor are believable and touching, and show the kind of
potential the movie might have realized had it not been so contrived, excessive,
and poorly written for the lead character, who herself gives a performance
that is also excessive and self-indulgent.",1023580800,20,3216,4.877289377289378
877056,5,6304442467,"Breaking the Waves, written and directed by Lars Von Trier Dancer in The Dark is a film with such poignant sentiment. The 1996 dramatic movie is about the confines of strict religion, mental illness, confusion, prostitution, and the power of love and healing.

Bess McNeil, deeply loves, obsesses and marries Jan (pronounced Yan) an oil rig worker. When an accident brings him back paralyzed, presumably forever, her pure nave innocent and childlike happiness takes an unspeakable turn with devastating consequences. Emily Watson gives a persuasive portrayal as Bess; veteran actor Stellan Skarsgard plays her husband Jan; and Dodo Katrin Cartlidge is excellent as her real true friend and sister-in-law.

Jan convinced of his demise, unable to make love to Beth and orders her to have sex with other men and to come back and tell him about it. This, he says, is the only way he can make love to her and to further stipulate, he says he will die if she doesn't.

There aren't any clear answers as to why Jan asks his wife to do this. Is he delusional, perverted, or does he really feel Bess will be better without him? Does Jan really love Bess so much that he is willing to set her free, or is he thinking of only himself when he embarks his innocent wife into hell, cast out from the church, her family, the town. Is he telling the truth when he believes he can make love to his wife via another man's pleasure. Does he sincerely realize that Bess is mentally incapable of handling this request? Did he realize where she was going, what might happen to her? We don't get those answers.

During chronological sequence breaks, you will hear the soundtrack - songs from the 70's, Jethro Tull's Cross Eyed Mary, Procol Harum's Whiter Shade of Pale, Elton John Your Song, Yellow Brick Road.  The music is set to picturesque scenes.

Same as von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, the camera angle can have that dizzying effect especially when it pans the length of a room.  You'll adjust as this intriguing conflicting plot develops. Again, the movie is long, two hours. There is graphic sex and nudity, both male and female. It isn't advisable for younger audiences.

He tells her to carry out his sick fantasies. There you have it folk, that's basically the story.

Your heart will break. Entering the church where women are not allowed to speak, she finally finds the voices in her head a little to quiet! She has something to say about her crippled husband asking her to have sex with other men, her mother calling her weak and stupid, her best friend coddling her, her own paranoia spinning out of control finally consumes her and turns all of her misconceptions about life into reality!
The actors are marvels to behold! Watson resembles a broken china doll but the star is here to me is Katrin Cartlidge; she is more than Bess' best friend but her conscience and wanna be savior. When religion is lumped into the same heap as moral standards but topped with power by the towns Elders the movie goes into heartbreakeing over-drive! The final chapter will leave you crying on end.

I put off seeing this film for one reason or another for a while and when I finally saw it I was I was surprised at how it affected me.  Breaking the Waves is alive in a way that few films are.  It is a film that asks difficult questions about faith and love and compassion and doesn't have easy answers for those questions.
The central question or conflict in the film comes when Bess's new husband Jan is injured while working on an oil rig.  Bess is told that he will never walk again.  While in the hospital Jan asks Bess to find a man to make love to and to come back and tell him about it.  It is hinted at that his mind may be affected by all the medication he is on.  Bess loves her husband so much that she does this for him, believing that the power of love through this gesture might make Jan better.  When she does this Jan's condition improves.  Bess believes that her sacrafice causes this.  Bess is soon banned from the church and from her town.
The question is:  Did her sacrafice really help her husband, who was not expected to even live at one point, survive?  The movie doesn't tell us, it lets us come to our own conclusions from our own life experiences.  The movie takes us on this emotional journey and doesn't make it easy or pleasant.  It certainly doesn't play down to its audience.  Breaking the Waves is powerful, emotional, spiritual, totally unconventional and a deeply satisfying experience.",1012089600,8,1545,4.409893992932862

I wish more American filmmakers would step up and make a 'real' drama (w/ real actors) - involving the difficulties of living.

877120,5,6304442467,"I don't know if this will be stating the obvious, but I'm just going to give my idea of what the film is about, seeing as the majority of the comments say that the film is beautifully
filmed, or the characters are one-dimensional and don't really elaborate in terms of the meat and potatoes of the film itself.
First of all, I don't think that Bess is retarded or has a learning disability like some people
have stated.  I think that when Dodo says to Jan that she's not right in the head, I think that
she is referring to a breakdown that Bess suffered after the death of her brother.
I'm not a religious person, but I don't think that the film is blasphemous like some religious
people have said.  If you watch the ending it is far more about the grace of God and how
He not only sees all, but understands a great deal more than we give him credit for.  I
found the ending to take a very pro- religion stance even though the action leading up to it
could be construed as anti-religion.
I also think that the town depicted here is a rare one.  I don't think Von Trier was trying to
depict a typical Scottish town.
As for the reason why Jan asks Bess to go with other men, my opinion is that he believed
he would be stuck in that bed for the rest of his life and he wanted Bess to experience sex,
knowing how much she enjoyed it and how much it altered and obviously affected her the
day of her wedding.  He thought that she would never do that, until Dodo says to him,
""You can get her to do whatever you want.""  Then he knew that if he told Bess to do that,
she would, because he remembered how much she adored him.  But, that said the reason I
think that Von Trier doesn't tell us why Jan has made this request upon his wife is because
she doesn't question it, and so neither should we.
Also, the reason why Bess eventually goes where she does (in the sky) is because she is like
a saint.  Her gift, or so she says, is that she believes and she believes until the end, and God
understood that she believes.  He saw her praying and He saw he evil deeds, but Bess -
unlike the old churchies who seem as if they talk to God like they know more than He does
- believed and that is the most important thing.
Now, I don't know how Emily Watson approached her character, but she seems to act on
instinct like Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant rather than a mapped out plan, and for those
who have said this film is one-dimensional specify why.  I didn't find it that way at all.  To
me the viewer can see that things are working behind the eyes of the characters.  Also for
people who have said that the film doesn't really show the daily lives of these characters, if
it did the film would be pointless because that's not what it is about!",1010707200,3,2734,4.147448015122873

Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find this film to be sad or to have a sorrowful ending.  Did they not watch it through to the very last, I wonder?

877163,5,6304442467,"Emily Watson's debut performance carries this superb reworking of Carl Dreyer's Ordet. Von Trier's direction is bold here. The film is completely, unabashedly melodramatic. It manages to hit heights that few films can, since it fearlessly risks alienating us. It's not the director's best film (Dancer in the Dark) but it's easily on of the top 20 films of the 90's.
One interesting thing that I read the other day regarded the use of the chapter headings in the movie. Von Trier called them rather offhandedly ""God's point of view"". Certainly, in light of that they become really relevant to the film. They are all gorgeous & shot on a normal film stock. If they're taken to be God's point of view, we can see all along that the events that take place are all part of God's plan. Furthermore, the scenes that aren't from God's POV are bleached out in color. this suggests only God can see the beauty in the world (and Bess' actions). Until I thought of them this way, they were mildly problematic for me. Of course until you see the whole film, there's no way to really come to this interpretation on your own, but it's food for thought.
If you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading and seek it out. It's best seen if you know little about it, as the film provides some of cinema's most transcendent moments, and those are best experienced without dilution.",1000080000,5,1361,4.604938271604938

Her waif-like innocence belies the eagerness to which she gives herself so entirely without resrevation on her wedding night.

Some of his Danish works, which are less well known, like a strange film called Idioterne, are positively shocking. Breaking the Waves is more mainstream but by no means conventional. The story tells of a nave and mentally unstable young woman named Bess MacNeil (played startlingly by Emily Watson). She has been reared in a very conservative and religious community (women are not allowed to speak in the church, people are judged harshly by the church, and they can easily be shunned for their activities. Outsiders are not easily welcomed into this community). Bess marries an oil rig worker named Jan (an excellent Stellan Skarsgard. He is an outsider to the community and is not easily accepted. The beginning of the film tells the tale of their marriage, Bess's exploration of sexuality with her new husband, Bess's childlike innocence and mental instability... and how she copes (or does not cope) with Jan's frequent absences. Eventually Jan succumbs to an accident on the oil rig and has to return home. He is hospitalised and is paralysed, and it is thought that he will be paralysed for life. He cannot bear to see his wife especially knowing that he cannot perform his husbandly duties, so he convinces her to go out and experiment sexually with as many men as she can. He convinces her that this helps him when really he is trying to do it for her. Not to add that he is doped up on pain medication. Soon the town learns of her activities and she is shunned from the society. The end is heartbreaking and the ironic twist at the end is painful.

I had to force myself to watch it, hoping that somehow something redeeming would transpire.  Two and one half hours later I can say that it did not.  I wish I could say that this was a great work of art, but it is not.  It is a sad, very sad commentary on the madness of human beings, a twentieth century ""tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.""  Particularly depressing were the church fathers in their beards and their stupidity.  And be forewarned, the sexuality is degrading, and the very essence of human love is willfully and repeatedly perverted.
In making this movie, Director Lars von Trier no doubt sought a kinship with the tragedies of Shakespeare and the Greeks in which the fates destroy the protagonist because of a so-called ""fatal flaw,"" a flaw the protagonist cannot help.  Bess's fatal flaw was her childlike nature twisted by circumstance.  In the great tragedies the essential purpose is to bring the audience, through its involvement and its identification with the protagonist, to a catharsis, a catharsis that cleanses the emotions and allows us to see the world as it really is, free of self-delusion.  But Von Trier's bizarre and pathetic ending with those ridiculous bells in the sky was closer to bathos than anything else, and steered us not toward catharsis but into a kind of emotional limbo where not even emptiness is felt.",984528000,11,1574,4.8

Jan's behaviour when he is paralysed is, quite frankly, risible.  The film is far too long and the camerawork repetitive and boring - the cinematography is, however, a highlight.

The film is shot as a documentary, but Von Trier makes that work very well.  The film tells the story of Bess whose love has no limits and knows no boundries.  Her decisions are always influenced by her own definition of her own faith.  Emily Watson is extraordinary in the scenes where she talks to God.

It happens and then begins a whirlwind of events which sets her life spiraling out of control. Jan goes away to sea only to return paralyzed. Depressed because he is unable to make love again, he makes a pact with his young bride. Go and have sex with other men. Tell me about and I will live. Who but Satan would make such a pact to an innocent naive woman child?
  Breaking the Waves is a brilliant story detailing the chapters of Bess's life as she tries to live up to the pact of the man that she truly loves. This picture can be interpreted on many levels of good and evil. Our setting is a place that is cold and brutal. Its people follow suit. Forgiveness, love and joy are foreign words in her small religious sect. Repression, being strong and doing one's duty are their gods.
  You will also find a heavy display of sexism and control of women in the movie. These episodes range from the elders of the church, Jan, the doctor and the sailors. All feel the need to contain the voice of women. Bess can't shut up. She is to good. Her determination to please out of a sense of helping the one she loves defies all logic. Her role playing as god's voice is harsh at times and very judgemental but through that playing she is able to bring some sense to her situation. Bess steps into a world of madness in her attempts to please and be that good girl?
  The cast of characters did a fine job in weaving together a story that is surreal and highly complex. Such a psychological drama challenges women to claim their own voice.

She reminds me so  much of Falconetti in her monumental performance in 'Passion of Joan of  Arc'. I enjoyed Frances McDormand in 'Fargo' a lot.

The chapter breaks, whose pictures could do well  starting-off scenes like more professional films do, are very out of place  to a person that expects the continuous flow of well-done movies.
This  film also doesn't live up to Amazon's plot summary.  The ""erotic  discovery"" doesn't appear any different than would occur for couples  whose first sex is after marriage.

877268,4,6304442467,"A fascinating but not entirely successful fantasia that owes just about all of its power to Emily Watson, making a stunning film debut. Watson is the mentally unstable Bess, who talks to God (God seems to talk back in her  voice). Bess, a virgin, marries the burly but sensitive oil-rig worker Jan  (Stellan Skarsgard). Once she tastes the joys of sex, Bess becomes  delirious with love for Jan. But soon he must return to the oil rig, where  he has an accident that paralyzes him. The erratic and heavily medicated  Jan takes it into his head to ask Bess a favor: she must sleep with other  men, and tell him about the encounters, to keep him alive. Both Jan and God  seem to want Bess to go through with it.
It's a mistake to take this sort  of fable literally, but director Lars von Trier makes everything seem  realistic with artsy touches like handheld camerawork, jump cuts, and  saturated photography (by Robby Muller). He also, for whatever reason,  divides the movie into chapters, and the chapter headings are surreal  landscapes with sometimes grating '70s rock songs played over them. You nod  and understand all the points von Trier is making, but everything is so  symbolic and predetermined that it seldom truly reaches you. The film is  haunting but mechanistic and, in its last third, borderline ludicrous --  the meaningful masochism gets to be more than a little much. Yet Emily  Watson, who's in almost every frame, very nearly puts the entire gigantic  daft movie across all by herself. Her elastic face is a playhouse for  violently conflicting emotions, and she's never less than touching. With  anyone else in the role (like Helena Bonham-Carter, who was going to do it  but dropped out), the movie would probably collapse.

877271,5,6304442467,"If I had to pick two films in this world that express my view and feelings on the western religion, they would be Scorsese's ""Last Temptation of Christ"" and surely, Lars von Trier's ""Breaking the  Waves"".
Von Trier's film revolves around the actions of a young girl  named Bess Mcneill (Emily Watson) living in a remote Irish coastal village,  controlled by a Calvinist Order. The town and its people are snagged like  dogs to the conservative ties of the church, and Bess (who according to her  sister: ""isn't right in the head"") seems to quell a rebelious  silence within herself; the need to feel something real. She discovers this  in her new husband Jan, who intrigued by her innocence and intensity,  offers her unconditional love packed newly in a sensual form.
Sure, like  many movies ""Breaking the Waves"" is underlyed by how we should  question the right of an institution to inform one what to be told and how  feel, but ""Breaking the Waves"" really questions who would care  about us in life.
Who would feel at a loss if you were to sacrifice for  something or someone? It's the closing note at the end of Von Trier's film,  as Bess is given a funeral by the Calvinist elders, in which she will be  ""sent to hell for her ghastly sins."" Later, Bess'body is stolen  by Jan, who miraculously rehabilitated, grants her a proper death at sea  amongst the swelling waves. And the scene that follows is the most  beautiful piece of cinemascope I have ever witnessed.
It's this that  seperates the ones who actually cared about Bess (Jan, her sister in-law,  her docter [strangely enough her mother doesn't shed a single tear of  grief]) and the one's who just couldn't or wouldn't understand.",962582400,7,1695,4.697278911564626

877340,5,6304442467,"The place is a barren,grim and ugly town in Scotland. Bess(Emily Watson), a seemingly retarded and meek girl is in a state of euphoria becuase she, against all expectations, is getting married. The groom is an oil-rig  worker Jan (Stellan Skarsgard), and as an outsider, the locals look on him  with great suspicion. But Bess is so in love with Jan that she can't wait  to get home to consumate their marriage, at the wedding she pulls him into  the lady's room where they have sex. Their relationship is deeply  passionatte, but tragedy strikes when Jan is injured and paralysed from the  neck down. He then asks his loving wife to perform sexual acts with  strangers and tell him about it.
  It is not clearly explained why he  asks her to do this, but my guess is, that deep down he really believes  that her sacrifice could actually save him. That God really could trade her  standing in this closed community for his life.
  I once watched two  fifty year old men sit down and debate weather it was allright from a  Religious stand point to blow air on soup inorder to cool it down. Was it  allright? Or will this lack of patience offend God? The elders of Bess's  community are similar, they ""love the word and love the law"",  they consider their Bible to be a manual for living effectivly reducing the  Faith to physical action. ""How can you love a word"" Bess asks  them.
  The film is anchored by an incredible performance by Emily  Watson as Bess. Yes, she is mentally challenged but not without a sense of  humour or a certain insight. ""I was always stupid, but I have one  talent, my talent is faith"" she says. And the way director Lars Von  Trier shoots the film gives it a faux documentary feeling. His style  breaksdown the barriers of film, making the characters that much closer to  the audience. He is adhering to the Dogme 95 manifesto he drafted with a  few others Danish film-makers which allows him only handheld cameras and  available light, but he is a liar when he claims that cost is the reason  for this. His upclose style is emotionally exhausting and grimly beautiful.  His willingness to show explicit nudity only adds to the realism of the  film, no strategically placed objects here.
  It is strange when you  consider what ""religious"" people do around the world, they claim  to understand God. Perhaps life's strangest irony that a good number of  ""the men of God"" do the Devil's work. Only Bess with her big  heart understands that a God who created the universe couldn't careless  weather all not you blow air onto soup.",961891200,,2554,4.586666666666667
877341,5,6304442467,"It's always amusing to see ads for dreck like ""Where the Heart  Is"" and ""Here on Earth"" with (usually) out-of-context  reviewers' quotes promising ""sheer emotional power!"" and ""a  more moving experience you won't find on the big screen!"" Because the  fact of the matter is, calling any of those films ""emotional""  after ""Breaking the Waves"" is like calling a firecracker  ""loud"" after an atomic bomb test.
It's difficult to believe,  but this was Emily Watson's debut performance (taking over after Helena  Bonham Carter backed out), and it's impossible to imagine anyone else in  the role. The camera's lingering close-ups of her perpetually wide eyes --  always focused, seemingly, on something just out of the view of any other  character in the film and, indeed, the audience itself -- recall the best  work of Dreyer (to whom the film owes an obvious debt). But the film also  has a style all its own, the hand-held camerawork (a direct antecedent of  the ""Dogme"" movement Von Trier would later co-found) giving it  the immediacy of a home movie. Coupled with Watson's brilliant performance,  only the most cold-hearted viewer cannot help but be moved by the trials of  poor, simple Bess.
The above description probably makes the film sound  like one of those blatant tearjerkers, the kind that makes most folks go  ""aww!"" and the more cynical groan at the obvious sentimentality.  And to a certain extent, you're right, but to a greater extent, you're  wrong. Bess is, to a large degree, responsible for the fate that befalls  her, although her handicap (she's quite obviously mentally retarded in some  way, although few reviews and plot synopses seem to mention this) makes it  difficult for the viewer to chastise her behavior. Bess is a good-hearted,  somewhat naive girl -- barely a woman at all -- who is unable or unwilling  to deal with the mitigating circumstances her life takes and retreats into  a world of delusion.
But is it a delusion? Or is Bess really helping her  husband and not just thinking she is? The miracle of ""Breaking the  Waves"" is that it manages to explore faith without ever questioning it  (the existence of God is never really in doubt as far as the plot is  concerned, in spite of Bess' unstable mental condition). Is believing  something enough to make it manifest? This is an important issue in our  cynical modern world, yet is so rarely dealt with in cinema. Compare this  with the only other recent film to tackle this question -- the middling  Steve Martin comedy-drama ""Leap of Faith"" -- and it's obvious  what a treasure ""Breaking the Waves"" truly is.",960508800,6,2599,4.853881278538813

I won't go too  much into the plot, because descriptions of this film can hardly touch on  the actual experience of watching it for yourself.  But I can say this  much: Emily Watson deserved the Oscar that was taken away from her in favor  of Frances McDormand (I guess a fakey Midwest accent can go a long way).  Her portrayal of Bess is unforgettable and heart-wrenching.  You think you  are actually witnessing this girl's descent into madness and pain, instead  of watching some actress go through the motions.  I cannot think of another  actress who could have done this as well as Emily.
The film's visual  style is not like 'normal' cinema, and at times seems like it was made on a  camcorder rather than a 'movie camera.'  Rather than feeling like a Blair  Witch camcorder feeling, you feel more like a witness of what is going on,  a silent character who just absorbs everything that happens.
There is no  score, except for the pieces that pop up after chapters in the picture,  which move you further into the picture.  These chapter breaks are rather  stunning scenes of nature with 70's music playing in the background.  This  may detract a bit from the picture if you are overly critical, but I  consider them to be short breathers between the drama that unfolds in the  film.
Be forewarned, though: This film has quite a bit of sexual content.  People who do not like that should probably stay away.  Everybody else  should watch this film.",959385600,3,1729,4.595394736842105
877344,5,6304442467,"'Breaking the Waves' is heartbreaking - a really sad film.  Set in a distant, isolated village in the Scottish highlands, it's the story of an innocent, devoutly religious young woman (the brilliant Emily Watson) who  falls in love with, and soon marries, a more wordly Danish oilrig worker.  Despite a lack of money and Bess's husband's need to stay away from her for  extended periods because of his job, their relationship seems to start off  well.  However, it is changed forever when the husband (called Jan) suffers  a near-fatal accident while working away at sea, and comes back unable to  participate in a physical relationship with his young wife.
This is where  the real tragedy of this long, lyrical film begins to unfold: Jan persuades  Bess to seduce strangers for sex, then tell him stories of the encounter  soon afterwards.  She unhappily obliges, and we witness many sad scenes of  Bess attempting to play the seductress.  Her situation gets worse and worse  - eventually she takes on the dangerous job of selling herself to  potentially violent foreign sailors illegally docked in ships off the  Scottish coast.  This really is a beautiful film - the deepest sadness  stems from the fact that Bess believes her actions are sanctioned by God  and will somehow help her husband to recover.  Needless to say, the story  ends far more pessimistically than Bess herself would have hoped.

Myself,  coming from the islands, a place where neighbours take an interest and care  for each other's well-being, where both Presbyterian ministers and Catholic  priests do the rounds of the house-bound and dying, this film is an  enormous insult to the values that they hold.

The documentary like  approach, coupled with the storyline (which is essentially a fantasy- note  the chapter headings and the final image, which, though jarring because of  its incongruity with the rest of the body of the film, actually serves to  tie the whole film into a cinematic storybook) make for one of the most  emotionally draining and cinematically rewarding films  I have ever had the  fortune of seeing.

877385,5,6304442467,"It was very odd watching this film the first time. I'm a Kierkegaard freak and the plot and the a lot of the motifs look like a wholesale rip off of ""Fear and Trembling"" and other books of Kierkegaard's works. This  impression was overwhelmingly confirmed by the ending. Then I discovered  the screenwriter-director is a native of Kierkegaard's hometown in Denmark,  which convinced me even further. This, of course, means that I think the  movie is intensely religious, that Emily Watson's character is a saint,  that the movie is essentially about religious sacrifice. Religion is,  ultimately, involved in the the transcendence of routinized religious  authority (represented by the deacons of the local Kirke).  They  hypocratically condemn souls to Hell, based on visible criterea, when a  God-relationship is invisible. This means they must condemn the saints for  being closer to god than they are. This problem provides a central focus of  the film.  There is also the moment, as Emily Watson's character dies, when  she reflects that she might have been mistaken in her understanding of god.  This moment reminds me of the cry from the Cross in Mark's Gospel: My god,  my god, why have you forsaken me. It makes the final triumph stand even  more starkly.",944956800,3,1264,5.028985507246377
877386,1,6304442467,"First 30 minutes of this movie really bored me to death. I expected more from it just because a lot of critics agreed that this is a good movie. Even siskel and ebert gave this movie two thumbs up. This movie is all  about a woman who was so in love with her husband. But, what I think is,  she was obsessed with him. She thinks that she was trying her best to make  her husband happy. She prayed every time and every time she would talk to  herself and pretend to be god. I mean.....give me a break.....she needs  more life!  I think that she should have been the one who got paralyzed  instead of her husband. I think you guys need to rent this video first  before even buying it..",944956800,7,683,4.121212121212121

7871146,3,6304442467,"Breaking The Waves simply did not resonate with me. I love that von Trier makes women the lead characters in almost all of his movies, and Emily Watson displays her exceptional acting talents in attempting to bring life to Bess, a simple, newlywed, piou young woman, living in a tiny Scottish village where she is treated as an outcast. Yet her faith never waivers, even when her husband, played by von Trier favorite, Stellan Skarsgrd, is paralyzed in an off-shore oil rig accident. Sadly, for me, despite the fine acting, and beautiful cinematography, writer-director von Trier never sold me on the story, and totally lost me on the ending. To say that von Trier is avant-garde is an understatement, so maybe I just missed what he was trying to do in this movie, and others may get it. But, it will require some attention and thought.",1477612800,,836,4.732876712328767
7871147,1,6304442467,"I would give this boring and pretentious movie a 0 if I could.  Yes, Emily Watson is a good actress.  The nudity and sex didn't bother me as I am no prude.  However, the story was so ridiculous as to strain credulity.  The girl who was mentally ill and retarded was unhealthily obsessed with her husband and her husband was making unwanted demands of her in order to feed his sadistic, selfish, sexual gratification.  He knew she did not possess the sexual experience or mental stability to negotiate sexual relationships with strangers.  He showed no concern for her safety in making this request especially given the state of her mental health and the expressed ""I can't"".  This is not love on either of their parts.

For those of you who say one needs ""experience"" to understand this film I call BS.  I chose not to get married until I was 34 and have been married almost 30 years to my best friend.  We have built a long history of love between us in spite of all the vicissitudes of marriage.  I am a health professional and have practiced in adult, pediatric, and neonatal intensive care as well as the ER and Psych unit.  I have witnessed cases that would rake your soul but also scenes of great love.  I am not confused about what love is.  I have seen many examples of real love.  This movie was not a representation of it.

Furthermore, while I am not a Christian and have seen a few atrocious things done by so-called Christians, I find Christians are human like all of us.  Even though I myself was sexually abused by a deacon of the Baptist Church when I was 7 (turns out he had sexually abused an elderly woman and 2 other little girls as well) I know that like most people Christians do not condone cruelty.  I think this film went too far in the depiction of the harshness of the Church's treatment afforded to a mentally ill daughter who grew up in that church.  While I have a problem with the evangelistic aspect of any religion or cult, it felt to me as though the writer and director had a bone to grind with religion and overstated their case to the point that they lost credibility.

In closing, I have to say that I found the film so sluggish as to be incredibly boring.  I actually fell asleep while watching it and had to rewind when I woke up.  It turns out I shouldn't have bothered.",1477094400,3,2311,4.3882352941176475
