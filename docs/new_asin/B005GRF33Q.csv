8472229,4,B005GRF33Q,when buying these I'm looking for something I might of missed.  I should say that I do not expect to like all the movies or even half of these sets when i buy.  I'm hoping for 2 i might like enough to watch over again . an a couple worth a first watch. It is better to me then buying one movie for 5 dollars i might not like.  this way i feel i get more for my money.,1373500800,2,367,3.6202531645569622
8472230,1,B005GRF33Q,They put you to sleep within the first 5 min.  Intro way too long. I'm hoping to get my money back.  Not even worth the $5.00 I paid for it at Walmart.,1317254400,3,151,3.6875
