8151490,4,B000JK8O9K,This is a great dvd which opened my eyes to the importanc of using the forward roll more than i have in the past. It doesnt really get into much of jens style. I think its worth the money,1476835200,,187,3.8205128205128207

8151493,5,B000JK8O9K,"i bought this to get Jens' take on his songs. I got much more than that - he just plain enjoys making music on the banjo and I found his philosophy on arranging music to be more valuable than the tablature themselves. Plenty of information on technique, etc., but for the most part I think his sincere approach is just incredible.",1390176000,3,330,4.426229508196721
8151494,5,B000JK8O9K,"Jens appears with his guitar playing brother and his bass player on this nicely organized DVD. Although most of the tunes he play are originals, he uses them well to show technique. What I like the best is that he uses the banjo to show many musical techniques that are not usually demonstrated on the banjo, and I really like what he is showing.

You can also play along with the DVD, and he even has a spot where you can play along and improvise with his brother and the bass player. This is really awesome because I have never personally met the Kruger brothers--so it has been my only chance to sit and play with them in my own living room--although, since they are on DVD--it is like having a jam session with holigrams of the Kugers where I feel like I am jamming with them, but, of course, they do not see or hear me or even know I exist--so there is no interactive interplay if I come up with something fun--they just keep playing the same chords--but hey--it at least allows me exposure to them in the only way I have access, and I am improving my musicianship because of my contact with this DVD. I love Jens patterns of chord progressions as they are more European than American, so it allows me to open my mind to incorporating some of this sound into more traditional playing.

I have several banjo DVDs--I mainly bought them to see what was available and how they were set up--as I have been considering authoring an instructional DVD soon. Although the others were interesting to preview to see what was in them and what worked and what didn't--Jen's was the only DVD that I didn't fall asleep watching, and actually incited me to pick up my banjo and play along.

The menu is straight forward and easy to navigate. There is a booklet of tabs to the tunes which would be helpful for folks who enjoy learning tunes note for note.
