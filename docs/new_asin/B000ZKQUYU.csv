3042537,5,B000ZKQUYU,"This is a nice collection of three different tales, with each being about 30 minutes long.  Each story starts out with a sweet lady (real action) who is writing a letter (the tale) to a child.  It appears to be England in the 19th century or early 20th century.  It's very calm, with nice music playing as she sits down to write the story.  Then the movie transitions into the cartoon which is her story.  They are all pretty cute and benign and my kids love them.",1296518400,21,464,4.287356321839081

3042539,5,B000ZKQUYU,"Great music, almost haunting. The animation is just like it walked off the books. My little girl loved it at age 2 or 3. At that age, we did need to skip some of the live action scenes between the animation, and she was a bit scared of McGregor! Calm and great for quiet time. Only thing I did not especially like was the scene where the neighbor whips Peter and his son with his walking stick. Kind of old school and a little shocking to see by today's standards, but no reason to avoid the whole thing because of it.",1293494400,11,518,4.138613861386139

It is entertaining, but calm with no obnoxious music.  I read the Beatrix Potter books to my children, but this DVD is a nice occasional treat and seems to help them make sense of the language in the books.

3042544,5,B000ZKQUYU,"Ever since I was a little kid, I've always greatly enjoyed Beatrix Potter's lovely artwork, and her, arguably, most infamous story, ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit""  (and it's sequel starring his cousin, Benjamin Bunny). Years ago when the Family Channel still existed, they ran an animated special based on the story, and to this day, I watch it every Easter (to the point that my VHS taped off of TV is becoming greatly worn out). So you can imagine my utter joy upon discovering two things:

1.) That the animated special was put on DVD.
and 2.) That the BBC made a whole slew of these episodes based off of Potter's fairy tales.

This collection features three episodes, each comprised of two stories.  ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny"" is the most famous of all--the classic story about a mischievous rabbit who becomes lost in Mr. McGreggor's garden and has to escape before he's caught and put in a pie. His cousin then mounts a mission to return to the garden and get back his lost clothes and other items, while running afoul of a cat.

""The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs. Tittlemouse"" takes place a few years after ""Peter Rabbit"", in which Benjamin Bunny's children are nearly eaten by Mr. McGreggor. The incident also helps a small mouse deal with a problem of getting rid of a bees' nest in her house.  (Just an FYI, however--it's said that Benjamin, when he grew up, married his cousin, Flopsy (one of Peter's sisters).  I realize that these stories were written many years ago in the olden days, when such a thing wasn't out of the ordinary.  None the less, I thought it fair to give warning, for those who might raise some eyebrows at that sort of thing.)

And finally, ""The Tale of Tom Kitten and Jemima Puddle-Duck"", in which three troublesome kittens have a hard time obeying their mom, and a duck who wants nothing more than to have children, leading to a sly and hungry fox taking advantage of her desperation.

Although I was familiar with Peter Rabbit, Benjamin Bunny, and Tom Kitten, the other stories were new to me, so it was a treat to see more of the cute and pleasant animal world that Beatrix Potter created. Each episode begins and ends with a live action segment, in which Beatrix herself opens and closes each story.  And whatever animation studio worked on this series deserves a medal--the characters and backgrounds look almost EXACTLY like Potter's artwork, as if each storybook magically came to life. You can easily tell that a lot of love went into making these shorts, and it makes me want to track down the other episodes now.

For those who love springtime, or are fans of Beatrix Potter's work, definitely try tracking down this lovely series. With great animation, a laid back atmosphere, and decent morals, it's the perfect thing to watch at Easter time.",1458172800,3,2810,4.654545454545454

3042565,5,B000ZKQUYU,"this is absolutely wonderful. It is mellow, non add-inducing (as a lot of cartoons are!) and just really positive. The music, the whole way of doing it, is positive and gives a very nice ambience to the house when it is on. It also connects several of Beatrix Potter's books into one and flows very cleverly into each one, overlapping a bit in a very tastefully done way. Nothing feels too far off her original books, which is a real treat. It's watercolors come to life! Highly recommend this dvd.",1385856000,4,498,4.544444444444444

3042574,5,B000ZKQUYU,"My 1 1/2 year old really enjoys watching this.  She is in a bunny phase, so we couldn't go wrong with Peter Rabbit.  The soft colors and slower pace of the videos doesn't wind her up either, it is a nice way to help her unwind...not as good as reading a book but sometimes you have to shake it up a little.",1356048000,4,306,3.9193548387096775
3042575,5,B000ZKQUYU,"I got this from the library expecting ""immature"" rendering of the story, as some cartoons are when adapted to video. I was pleased to see animals in realistic and high detail, playing true to the temperaments and quirks of their species. The gardens and woods plants were similarly well represented. The animals live in appropriate homes: Ms. Tittlemouse in a clean dry warren,the bunnies in a hill, the ducks in a farmyard.

All of the animals move realistically, mostly - the kittens have a bit of trouble standing upright, and prefer to scamper on all four! The puddle ducks waddle and ""bill"" things, they do not develop fingers in their wings.

The stories are told with a female narrator, who begins the tales for BBC, as if she is writing to a friend and telling her stories each time. Then the cartoon episode begins. These were a series for Tv, not one continuous movie nor steps in a series that must go in order. I like that - if I want to hear one tale, I have a complete little story beginning thru end, and it doesn't matter if I watch the rest the same day.

NOTE - some liberal minded people may be offended by these stories, because they have traditional values. They portray spanking disobedient boys by a male authority figure, women as sensitive and more emotional than males, mothers and daughters in domestic roles, boys as reckless and risk-taking while girls are quiet and responsible by comparison.

NOTE - these same qualities make conservative, traditional values minded folks very happy.

It's wholly unlike modern cartoons, which largely portray violence, sexuality, rebellion, revenge,criminal behavior, occultism, and contempt for authority. Something to do a social studies/psych project on, hmm?

Meanwhile, enjoy.",1344470400,9,1746,4.962328767123288
3042576,5,B000ZKQUYU,"I purchased ""The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends"" for my friend's daughter along with the book,  ""The Tales of Peter Rabbit"".  Apparently her daughter loves this dvd so much that her mother reported that she watches it ever day and will not watch any of her other movies after being introduced to Peter Rabbit.",1341878400,4,312,4.654545454545454
3042577,5,B000ZKQUYU,The stories and the animation were simply charming! Also loved the fact that the narrator had a British accent. I know my grandson will love watching this.,1336435200,2,155,4.777777777777778
3042578,5,B000ZKQUYU,"""The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends"" is part of The Beatrix Potter Collection (there are three DVDs in the set) and I'd advise anyone who is contemplating buying this to consider buying the entire set (which I did). All three DVDs contain the entire series of animated features based on the stories of Beatrix Potter and produced by the BBC. The animation is faithful to Ms. Potter's illustrations and everything about this production is of superior quality.

Each episode is introduced by a beautiful score and a little segment featuring an actress portraying Ms. Potter going about her daily life, whether it be painting on top of a hill overlooking the scenic Lake District, posting mail, or back at home with her real-life bunny, Peter, sitting by the fireplace and sketching out something for a friend or relative (Ms. Potter was after all a great correspondent).

This DVD features three episodes:

The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny
The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs. Tittlemouse
The Tale of Tom Kitten and Jemima Puddle-Duck

The episode runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.",1336003200,69,1175,4.889447236180905
3042579,5,B000ZKQUYU,"This collection was exactly what I expected and the collector's box is worth keeping to hand down to the next generation.

3042580,5,B000ZKQUYU,"I am not a fan of a lot of children DVDs out there but this one is one of our favorites! It begins by showing a woman with her dog painting and shows lots of animals on their walk home in the rain.  The music is calming and lovely and then the story begins.  I like to sit with my children and watch it together.  My 2, 3, and 4 year old just love it.",1301875200,9,351,3.6533333333333333

3277068,5,B000ZKQUYU,"I read Beatrix Potter books to my children, and  am now reading them to my grandchildren. I have a collection of the books, and love both the wording and the beautiful drawings. This CD uses most of the original words, and the animation is so much like the original drawings. We have watched it over and over. I highly recommend it!

3277069,5,B000ZKQUYU,"This DVD was as entertaining to the adults in the room as it was to the children.  The animation is well done, and we loved the way the live action segued so easily into the animation.  Small children might be frightened by Farmer McGregor -- that would be my only concern for children under the age of three or four.",1359849600,6,317,4.266666666666667

3277071,5,B000ZKQUYU,"My 1 1/2 year old really enjoys watching this.  She is in a bunny phase, so we couldn't go wrong with Peter Rabbit.  The soft colors and slower pace of the videos doesn't wind her up either, it is a nice way to help her unwind...not as good as reading a book but sometimes you have to shake it up a little.",1356048000,4,306,3.9193548387096775
3277072,5,B000ZKQUYU,"I got this from the library expecting ""immature"" rendering of the story, as some cartoons are when adapted to video. I was pleased to see animals in realistic and high detail, playing true to the temperaments and quirks of their species. The gardens and woods plants were similarly well represented. The animals live in appropriate homes: Ms. Tittlemouse in a clean dry warren,the bunnies in a hill, the ducks in a farmyard.

All of the animals move realistically, mostly - the kittens have a bit of trouble standing upright, and prefer to scamper on all four! The puddle ducks waddle and ""bill"" things, they do not develop fingers in their wings.

The stories are told with a female narrator, who begins the tales for BBC, as if she is writing to a friend and telling her stories each time. Then the cartoon episode begins. These were a series for Tv, not one continuous movie nor steps in a series that must go in order. I like that - if I want to hear one tale, I have a complete little story beginning thru end, and it doesn't matter if I watch the rest the same day.

NOTE - some liberal minded people may be offended by these stories, because they have traditional values. They portray spanking disobedient boys by a male authority figure, women as sensitive and more emotional than males, mothers and daughters in domestic roles, boys as reckless and risk-taking while girls are quiet and responsible by comparison.

NOTE - these same qualities make conservative, traditional values minded folks very happy.

It's wholly unlike modern cartoons, which largely portray violence, sexuality, rebellion, revenge,criminal behavior, occultism, and contempt for authority. Something to do a social studies/psych project on, hmm?

Meanwhile, enjoy.",1344470400,9,1746,4.962328767123288
3277073,5,B000ZKQUYU,"I purchased ""The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends"" for my friend's daughter along with the book,  ""The Tales of Peter Rabbit"".  Apparently her daughter loves this dvd so much that her mother reported that she watches it ever day and will not watch any of her other movies after being introduced to Peter Rabbit.",1341878400,4,312,4.654545454545454
3277074,5,B000ZKQUYU,The stories and the animation were simply charming! Also loved the fact that the narrator had a British accent. I know my grandson will love watching this.,1336435200,2,155,4.777777777777778
3277075,5,B000ZKQUYU,"""The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends"" is part of The Beatrix Potter Collection (there are three DVDs in the set) and I'd advise anyone who is contemplating buying this to consider buying the entire set (which I did). All three DVDs contain the entire series of animated features based on the stories of Beatrix Potter and produced by the BBC. The animation is faithful to Ms. Potter's illustrations and everything about this production is of superior quality.

Each episode is introduced by a beautiful score and a little segment featuring an actress portraying Ms. Potter going about her daily life, whether it be painting on top of a hill overlooking the scenic Lake District, posting mail, or back at home with her real-life bunny, Peter, sitting by the fireplace and sketching out something for a friend or relative (Ms. Potter was after all a great correspondent).

This DVD features three episodes:

The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny
The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs. Tittlemouse
The Tale of Tom Kitten and Jemima Puddle-Duck

The episode runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.",1336003200,69,1175,4.889447236180905

3277077,5,B000ZKQUYU,"I am not a fan of a lot of children DVDs out there but this one is one of our favorites! It begins by showing a woman with her dog painting and shows lots of animals on their walk home in the rain.  The music is calming and lovely and then the story begins.  I like to sit with my children and watch it together.  My 2, 3, and 4 year old just love it.",1301875200,9,351,3.6533333333333333
