I would be willing to pay big bucks to have the entire series (all 120 episodes) on DVD.  If that ever happens, I hope it will include bonus materials to tell us how it was done--who wrote the scripts, did the music, manned the characters, did the voices, etc.

Every episode had warmth, humor, and charm, and taught good values.  This show appeals to adults as well as children.  The songs were fabulous.  How did the actors make those puppet heads convey such emotion and how did they synchronize the voices with the facial expressions?  The backdrops and scenery were beautiful also.  What an amazing bunch of talented people worked on this show! I watched Welcome to Pooh Corner with my sons when they were little and now with my granddaughter.  I wish I had recorded every episode from the Disney Channel, but I only got 9 of them.  Then I bought the 6-volume tape series.  But all my videos are worn out from repeat viewing, so I would dearly love to have this on DVD.  All 120 episodes, please!  I would buy copies for grandchildren and friends, as well as myself.  This is too good to fade away into obscurity.  Please bring it back!

Volume 3 contains these episodes:  ""Piglet Pride,"" ""Roo's Great Adventure,"" ""Eeyore Talks to Himself,"" and ""Snow Falls on Pooh Corner.""",1230940800,9,1424,4.605577689243028

(My favorie episode of this set is the one with Roo, because it's fun to see how he is presented in the old show.) All in all, a great purchase.",1171584000,3,291,4.12280701754386
