5736472,5,B00CS1N1XC,"So many comics these days rely on sex and curse words in order to evoke a laugh.  Not so with Trevor Noah.  While not adverse to using a curse word - sparingly - and making sexual innuendos - with taste and real humor - Trevor Noah relies on observation and imitation of things we Americans take for granted but are ever so strange to those who come from other parts of the world.  There is a real intellect at work here.  His observations are on target, brilliantly realized, brilliantly executed, and thus really, really funny.  Don't miss this comic.  He's a genius.",1377388800,2,569,4.529411764705882
5736473,5,B00CS1N1XC,"I loved Trevor because he demonstrated that you don't have to use crude and vulgar language to be funny. Evidently, he believes it doesn't belong in comedy and I agree. He was able to hold my interest and wonder what's next, and he's really cute.",1377216000,,246,4.488888888888889
5736474,5,B00CS1N1XC,"Most comedy these days tends to be inflammatory and loaded with vulgar.  Trevor Noah's brand of comedy, on the other hand, is very intelligent and insightful.  I tend to liken his style to that of Franklin Ajaye, Jerry Seinfeld and even Sinbad.

On this particular video, much of what he talks about relates to his trek from South Africa to America and his perspectives between the two.  There are keen observations about culture, ethnicity, and society which are delivered with wit and which will leave you laughing out loud.

I actually watched the video yesterday afternoon and found myself with tears in my eyes.  I liked it so much that I watched it again when I returned home in the evening.  During this second viewing, I still found myself laughing although I knew what was coming up next in Trevor Noah's presentation.

I don't think Trevor Noah is yet a big name on the US comedy scene yet.  However, based upon what I saw in the video, I sense he's got a bright future ahead of him.",1377129600,,993,4.564971751412429
5736475,5,B00CS1N1XC,Trevor's routine was wonderfully fresh and amazing. He kept me hooked throughout the entire performance. Hilariously awe inspiring takes on controversial issues will make you laugh at his jokes and at yourself. Brilliant!,1376006400,,221,5.7272727272727275
5736476,5,B00CS1N1XC,"This is awesome. He's so funny and doesn't curse to make it FUNNY!
Kids appropriate comedy.
Never a dull moments with him.",1375574400,13,122,4.590909090909091
5736477,5,B00CS1N1XC,"This review is of AFRICAN-AMERICAN stand-up show only.  We haven't seen any others yet!

We watched this show over the past three nights and laughed until tears ran down our cheeks!  We are 55+ so this really appealed to our older sense of humor!  This man is so talented it's not funny.  He speaks at least 6 languages, is extremely intelligent, articulate, humorous, and doesn't use filthy cuss words for shock value or for a laugh!

He takes the part of the other person that he is talking to in his stand-up act, which really makes it quite hilarious! We respect, admire and LOVE this adorable guy!  So, unless you have zero sense of humor, you will laugh your socks off during his African-American show! He covers dozens of different topics so don't think it's only about that! We are getting this for our kids so they can enjoy it too!

I'd say if you watch his stand up, you shouldn't eat or drink during as you may choke to death from uncontrollable laughter!

5736478,5,B00CS1N1XC,"Brilliant. Fresh. Intelligent. Insightful. Hilarious.

5736480,5,B00CS1N1XC,I only knew of Trevor Noah from him taking over Jon Stewart's role on the The Daily Show. I was so used to Jon Stewart and I never really gave him a chance or thought he was that great.

Laughed and cried. Then I sought to watch his other shows which were just as enlightening but lighthearted and funny. Ecstatic that someone with his vision was chosen to fill Jon Stewart's shoes I was confident he could bring us even broader views. Always a Daily Show watcher, now it's needed badly.

He has an amazing talent for imitating American accents, from Southerners to the Hood. He imitates both men and women. He seems to genuinely like America and Americans, but there are also things that puzzle him about how Americans pronounce words, and certain uses of words that differ from how they are used in South Africa and other places. Puzzles over, for example, how America-centric our news and interests are vs. South Africa insofar as they are aware of what is going on in America and American television and Americans know little or next to nothing about South Africa.

I thought he was witty and entertaining and it was a fun experience. I urge everyone to take a look and find out more about this person.

Except that even a cursory etymological search would reveal that lb is short for the latin ""libra,"" from which ""libra pondo"" (pound weight) was abbreviated.

It's this sort of poorly informed joke that he tosses about in his standup, and just doesn't appeal to me.  This man is not only no replacement for Jon Stewart, he's just not funny.

He didn't seem very comfortable with the audience enough times throughout the performance that it was even uncomfortable from my living room, as well. Many of the jokes where America (or Americans) was held lacking in comparison to the rest of the world didn't really go over well with the audience, and it seemed to be a theme for much of his routine.

Noah presents as a sweet yearning kid in a candy store. What a delight to hear tales of my home country which you rarely appreciate from a foreigner's eyes. He details many comic interpretations of our customs and language and delivers in a serious hilarious manner.

I have greatly diminished my view of the USA as powerful, mighty, and enchanting. However, this young man envisions a country that I was once familiar and then instilled what remaining pride I had into overwhelming joy. Albeit the strong arm policies were duly noted and appreciated. He wants to fit in and his praises may be overstated but I welcomed them nonetheless.

Replacing Jon is going to present a major challenge and after watching this talented handsome man with a broad variety of accents and cheery demeanor, he just might make it work. Best of luck to you Noah!

5737229,5,B00CS1N1XC,"I am a South African living in the US (7 years) so I am a little biased, but this is pretty damn awesome. Comedians depend very much on personal preference, but as long as you are cool with someone playfully taking the piss out of the US attitudes towards race and global politics you should enjoy it. Easily better and less predictable than 95% of the comedy I am exposed to these days.",1398556800,18,387,4.315068493150685
5737230,5,B00CS1N1XC,My sister recommended this comedian to me and I'm glad she did. He's pretty funny and intriguing. It's always interesting listening to someone who isn't from America talk about their experiences here. He also has other shows that involve other places he's visited but obviously me being American found this one very entertaining.,1398211200,3,329,5.226415094339623

5737234,5,B00CS1N1XC,Trevor Noah's comedy is not just your typical standup routine. He is amazing at fusion of how the rest of the world sees America and our culture.

5737248,5,B00CS1N1XC,"I was introduced to Trevor Noah via Netflix and I am glad I was. He is hilarious. Everything he says is right on point. I love hearing the perspective of an outsider on America delivered in a genuine way. If you don't find him funny, hit mute and just watch. Did I mention he is also fun to look at? If he ever comes to Kansas City, I will be first online buying my ticket. If he goes to Chicago, ROADTRIP! I have told everyone I know that loves to laugh about this man. He is fantastic. I am on Amazon trying to buy the DVD. All I am finding are streaming copies. Boo Amazon!...There is also a documentary that follows Trevor leading up to his first one man performance in South Africa before he exploded that was filmed in 2009 by an American college student and this was his thesis project. It has been released and I highly recommend it. You will fall in love with Trevor all over again.",1389225600,2,891,4.216374269005848
5737249,3,B00CS1N1XC,"I have to say that I was already a Trevor Noah fan before I watched this video. I had seen him on Youtube and watched a bunch of his videos multiple times, laughing hard every time. He is extremely clever and has an amazing ability to imitate accents. You will be amazed at how this South African can effortlessly sound like a White businessman, Black rapper or a Puerto Rican. That's in addition to his own native South African accent, an LA Valley girl and even a Japanese man. Fantastic and very entertaining! If you check him out on Youtube youll see that he is hilarious doing Aussie, Brit, Indian and different South African accents as well.

This particular routine was hit and miss in a lot of places though. When he talked about being mixed race as a one way street (you can go from Mixed-Race to Black but never Mixed-Race to White) that was funny and insightful. He pointed out a racist contradiction but I didn't feel judged. I just laughed and thought Wow, hes right!. Other jokes (the US doesnt use the metric system, African Americans are not African, Italian Americans are not Italian, etc.) made him sound like a whiny, smug European. Trevor Noah is a very funny man but this is not his best performance.",1388966400,4,1221,4.55

especially from South Africa. Funny with lots of humor.",1387670400,,277,5.0
5737258,5,B00CS1N1XC,"He is incredibly funny.. Really puts a spin on things that we as Americans sometimes just don't think about.. He is very Diverse giving us  African, Japanese, Chinese, Puerto Rican , Arab, Jamaican, Latino, Iranian, Caucasian, and African American accents, and impressions. So many of his jokes are so real and so funny.. I saw this show on TV one night and just adored him so much that I bought this DVD on amazon. After getting it I didn't get a chance to watch it because I was letting all of my friends borrow it left and right I didn't get it back for almost two months and everyone who borrowed it loved it.. I even had a get together at my house and played this DVD. Imagine 15 plus people of all races in a living room cracking up glued to the TV, I loved it.. People were asking me who is this guy he's hilarious.. So I later bought a second DVD in fear of loosing this one or it getting damaged from all the use..

The bar was set fairly low because of what's out there nowadays. This comedian raises the bar in so many ways. This is a relatively ""clean"" show, with a few curse words here and there, but like Sinbad, he's so gifted at what he does, cursing is unnecessary. I'd give this show 10 stars if I could.",1383523200,16,474,4.163043478260869
