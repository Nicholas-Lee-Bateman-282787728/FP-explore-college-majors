8245975,4,B0012HIDFE,"I recently purchased this DVD from Amazon.  yes the first movie cut and the second one played.  When I left the review Rays Music who I bought the movie from contacted me immediately and expressed there regret that I was unsatisfied with the movie.  They not only refunded my money, but they also sent me another one to see if that one worked.  I can see by the other reviews that all copies could be bad.  But the character of this company to trust the integrity of there customers.  The stars goes out to them, plus it is a good movie.  The second one, if your bored watch it, but the first one is a must see,.",1291680000,,612,4.17948717948718
8245976,1,B0012HIDFE,"DO NOT BUY this version of these movies.  The biggest problem is, the ending of Fearless Hyena 1 is *completely missing*.  The movie cuts out after Jackie gets his hat handed to him by the bad guy.  If you're worried about missing out on Fearless Hyena 2, don't be---it is nothing special, it's a remix (some might say mishmash) of the first movie with other bits added.

Just to be clear I returned this product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fearless-Hyena-Fearless-Hyena-2-Jackie-Chan-Martial-Arts-Double-Feature/dp/B0012HIDFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fearless Hyena + Fearless Hyena 2 (Jackie Chan) *Martial Arts Double Feature*</a>

Additional:  The ""Platinum Series"" version of Fearless Hyena is what I got to replace it:

And that version does have the entire movie.  Unfortunately right this second that product is listed for almost $70, while I only paid $9 for it, so YMMV---you might have better luck with one of several other editions of the same movie, just make sure you check the returns policy.",1265241600,,1209,6.51875
