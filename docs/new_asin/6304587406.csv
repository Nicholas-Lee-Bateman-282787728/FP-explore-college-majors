7874732,5,6304587406,"This film continues to permeate my mind, eleven years afer the first time I had the honor to see it, in its full glory, in the movie theater.  This very important story is a character study of the role of the young wife in the culture of Satyajit Ray's Bengali-speaking society.  (I wish I could say what region of India this film was specific to.  There is such a diversity of cultures in India, it would be unfair to generalize this role, in saying that this is the image that the entire nation has of Indian wives, and their responsiblity to their husband, as well as to the hearth.)

Doyamoyee (Sharmila Tagore) is the beautiful, seventeen year old bride of Umaprasad (Soumitra Chatterjee).  When Umaprasad must go away for an extended period of time, Doyamoyee is left to stay with his family--that includes his father, Kalikinkar (Chhabi Biswas).  A prophetic vision comes to Kalikinkar, while he is dreaming.  He sees Doyamoyee as the healing goddess, Kali.  Once that imagery lingers in his mind, he is convinced that she has been annointed as the second coming of the goddess, and has the power to heal the sick in their community. That said, she is made to sit on an alter, day in and day out, and perform healing rituals for the afflicted.  Umaprasad arrives home, to discover, this, and is more than skeptical.

This is a cautionary tale at how far visions will drive people, to realize--quite literally, in this case--their dreams. Ray poses this important point, through beautiful storytelling (through his use of cinematography, direction and wonderful acting).  They really need to re-release in the theaters.  Satyajit Ray is one of the most important directors of all time, in my opinion.  The newer generation needs to see his films, to fully appreciate his artistic genius, as a storyteller and filmmaker.  This is a great introduction......Also reccomended:  ""Two Daughters"" and ""The Stranger.""",1140134400,6,1915,4.922118380062305
7874733,5,6304587406,"A Ray masterpiece. Made in black and white with tremendous use of shadows and use of the color black, this movie is one of Ray's most artistic. With deft touches on his canvas, Ray has painted a horrific picture of religious mania, irrationality, the fraility of the human mind and the overwhelming power of suggestion. Extracting excellent performances from his stellar star cast, Ray builds the story at a fast pace culminating in an explosive climax that is as shocking as it is deeply symbolic.",1102550400,,498,4.870588235294117
7874734,5,6304587406,"Based on a story by Prabhat Kuman Mukherjee, this 1960 Indian film was written and directed by Satyajit Ray, one of his many accomplishments in a long and distinguished career.  It's in the Bengali language with English subtitles, which were a bit hard to read on the black and white film, and some of it wasn't even translated. However, I had no trouble getting interested in the story and following what was going on.
I could feel the love and devotion between a young married couple as they separate for a month because the husband has to take exams in a distant city.  He's modern and has become a Christian and rejects his father's old-fashioned religion and old-fashioned ways.  The wife, Dona, who is only 17 years old, goes to stay with the father who absolutely adores her, much to the jealously of his other daughter-in-law who lives with him.  One night the old man has a vision and declares that Dona is the incarnation of the Goddess Kali and falls at her feet to worship her. How this all plays out leads to a conclusion that is open to interpretation.
The actors are all wonderful, and when Dona opens her huge eyes, outlined in kohl, she has the ability to make one look speak volumes.  A lot of the film is in shadows, but there is always light on the whites of the characters' eyes.  This is a story about changing values and about faith and the whole production is wrapped in this kind of aura.  There is always a background of sitar music, which adds to the atmosphere. One of the best things about the film, however, was that it transported me to India and into the hearts and minds of a culture that is not mine.  I can now understand why Satyajit Ray has received so much international acclaim.  Recommended.",1045267200,7,1731,4.50479233226837
7874735,5,6304587406,"It is heard that none other than the legendary,nobel-laureate Bengalee poet , Rabindranath Tagore gave the storyline of Devi to its writer Prabhat Mukherjee. It is also heard that,Tagore was not particularly happy with the story when it was completed by Mukherjee.
  Whether the story was wish-fulfilling to Tagore or not,I guess Ray was definitely happy with the story as it gave him  the right amount of conflicts to make a good drama.

The storyline is simple:the father-in-law(Chobi Biswas) beleives that his daughter-in-law(Sharmila Tagore) is an incarnation of Goddess Kali and some coincidental incidents strenthen his belief. The son(Soumitra Chatterjee) is an educated youth who comes home from the city and compleately denies the whole fact. The conflict is now between the outdated father and the modern son. The innocent daughter-in-law is caught in the vortex of this conflict. See for yourself where this conflict ultimately culminates in.
 Ray paints these conflict scenarios with his characteristic mood-setting and  brilliant camera actions throughout the film.
One example of mood-setting of a nighttime in a countryside  could be that scene where the couple's kiss behind a mosquito-net is  shot in a scantily-lit set with shrilling crickets and howling jackals in the backdrop.
Talking about how Ray used his  movie-camera to instill a picture in your mind one just  has to remember that very  long shot of thousands of people making a beeline to see the incarnation or ""Devi"".
To sum it up,this movie made way back in 1960 is still strikingly relevant and definitely is a grand treat to your heart, to your consciences - a work of masterly direction and some superb acting by the casts. You must see it.",1016064000,11,1724,5.14336917562724
