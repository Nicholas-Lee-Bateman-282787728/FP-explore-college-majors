2043321,5,B0001YJ420,"No other children's programming will keep my 2 1/2-year-old occupied for 30 minutes than Oh Wow! Cows! He even likes to narrate as he watches, telling me when the horse will run by or pointing out the cow with horns. What's amazing is that it also draws my 13-month-old like a magnet when he hears the intro music start. This show teaches kids some basic facts about cows, but what's really neat is it teaches them how to spell six words.",1082073600,6,438,4.419753086419753

2043335,5,B0001YJ420,"My two year old absolutely LOVES this video.  I would encourage anyone with a child who loves cows to purchase this video.  Also, my son has recently taken a real interest in letters.  This has just the right balance of music, spelling, and of course...cows!  I'm about to purchase the horse one right now!  I wish the company would have made more...I need one about ducks!",1308787200,,373,4.590909090909091

2043337,3,B0001YJ420,"My kid LOVES cows and is just 2 now.  He loves his ABCs and is curious about trying to learn to spell.  This DVD was great in that it meets both needs.  For some reason he only likes half of the DVD.  As they get to the end he wants it out.  Seems like the content at the end is not as appealing.

The downside to this DVD for us is that the portions of the DVD that contain graphics to teach the kids how to spell by showing letters don't work on my DVD.  The screen simply goes blank.  (2003 Tahoe OEM DVD)  All other DVDs work fine in our vehicle.  It does show well on more modern DVD players in our house so I am not sure where the issue is.

In summary I expected a DVD that he would love and he really likes the first half.  When the screen goes blank he is sure to tell us it went ""off"".",1263945600,,795,3.7804878048780486
2043338,5,B0001YJ420,This video is awesome!  My son is 20 months old and has grown to love cows.  He asks to watch this 2-3 times a week and will hold his attention for a good 15 minutes; long enough to get his cow fix.  I HIGHLY recommend this product if your child is into cows.  Totally worth the money!,1232323200,,285,3.9473684210526314
2043339,5,B0001YJ420,One of the most beautiful dvds for children I have ever seen. Lovely classical music with video of gentle cows & calfs grazzing happily in their pasture. It makes you just want to reach out and pet them !! In the  video the children learn simple words like C-O-W or M-O-O.Then back to the cows grazzing. Looking forward to buying more videos by this group!,1194307200,3,356,4.476923076923077
2043340,4,B0001YJ420,"My 21-month-old son is fascinated with cows, and this video keeps him occupied for the whole 30 minutes (Well, mostly - he still takes breaks to play with toys, but it keeps him from needing my attention for the whole 30 minutes).

The music is beautiful and peaceful, and the voice of the female narrator is pleasant and unobtrusive - I can read or study while my son watches it :) It also teaches the words ""Moo,"" ""Cow,"" ""Hay,"" ""Milk,"" ""Farm,"" and ""Calf."" After watching it 3 times, ""hay"" has been added to his vocabulary and he's trying to spell ""M-I-L-K"" with the narrator! He's not old enough to really know what he's doing, but it's impressive all the same, lol.

There are only 2 things I don't particularly like about the video. 1) at the begining, the narrator says ""When God created the animals, he made Cows"" - this is, however, the only reference to such things in the video, so it's tolerable; 2) during the ""milk"" section, it shows cows at a Dairy being milked by machines. I would much prefer it to show cows on a farm being milked by humans. Still, not a huge deal.",1181174400,,1081,4.42713567839196

8018370,5,B0001YJ420,Awesome....my 16 month old grandson absolutely loves this.  So I then ordered the one called Horse of Course also by God's Creation Video and it is a great one as well.  I only wish they had more of these types of videos.  I have looked but did not find any more of other animals by this particular company.,1501459200,,307,4.258620689655173
