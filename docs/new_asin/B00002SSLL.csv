7916170,3,B00002SSLL,"I am a retired SFPD Inspector. I recently purchased and viewed this tape. The tape gives a fairly good account of the Zodiac cases in general, but there are numerous factual errors in the details of the cases. It seems that many who make movies, create websites and write books on this subject rely on information from newspaper accounts and early books. as a result certain myths have evolved about the cases. The tape is a good primer for a new generation who know nothing about the cases. Also the acting is rudimentary. However, the original taped scenes and interviews with investigators made at the time of the incidents make the tape worthwhile. I think Lawrence Block is a high point for the tape. He is amusing and at the same time provides intrigue to the story. The material is somewhat dated, but nothing really significant has occurred in the cases since the vid was made. Despite the deficiencies, I recommend the tape for people who are new to the investigation. For those who are knowledgable on the cases, there is nothing new for you here.
And for Arthur Leigh Allen buffs, just remember that Allen had THREE search warrants served on his places of residence, one on his trailer in Santa Rosa and two on his mothers house in Vallejo. Not a shred of evidence was found connecting him to the Zodiac cases. Allen took and PASSED a polygraph examination. Boxes full of his handwriting was analyzed by both Sherwood Morrell AND Lloyd Cunningham. Both handwriting experts stated positively that Allen's writing was NOT the Zodiac's. A DNA examination of a confirmed Zodiac envelope showed not a single marker matched Allen. The fingerprint found on the cab at the Stine crime scene did NOT match any of Allen's prints. At this point, these cases will only be solved through physical evidence, positively connecting a suspect to the crimes. Not speculation about circumstantial ""evidence"".",1451174400,,1900,4.867283950617284
7916171,4,B00002SSLL,"The zodiac case reopened, is a very well done documentry, although Lawrence Block, should hire someone else to do the tags to each segement, his bland non emotional comments leave you saying, get this guy out of here  and let's get back to the program.  Being a child during the time Zodiac  was at the height of his reign of terror, I can remember the school taking  extra percautions with all of us, I remember them talking about it in a  very sensored fashioned, only telling us go straight home and do not talk  to strangers etc.  This video left me wanting more. I have read Robert  Graysmith's chilling book and wished that the video could have delivered  more on that level, however I enjoyed the old film footage and was  impressed with how each of the re-enactments were staged. I was surprised  how one segemnt was left out, where Zodiac took a young mother and her  child on a ride, where she was taunted and told she would be killed,  luckily she escaped!  All in all, a beginner on the case will definatley  catch the Zodiac bug from seeing this video.",949276800,6,1065,4.473958333333333
7916172,4,B00002SSLL,"Despite the horrible acting of a terribly misplaced Lawrence Block as the host(he has the onscreen presence of a corpse), this is a fine overview of the Zodiac case.  Both newcomers to the case and those familiar with it  will be fascinated by this informative video. I myself happen to be one of  those Zodiac-case ""buffs"", and I truly enjoyed the tape,  especially the news footage from the Zodiac era. I particularly enjoyed  seeing clips of an interview with main suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. I lent  the tape to a fellow true-crime buff who had no knowledge of the case at  all and she came away with her curiosity piqued. Needless to say, she is  planning on purchasing Robert Graysmith's excellent book  ""ZODIAC"". Buy and enjoy!",947462400,12,734,4.761904761904762
