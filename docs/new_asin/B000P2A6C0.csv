2807785,5,B000P2A6C0,"I am someone with a low tolerance for weird or silly things, and I didn't expect to love this show - I was watching with my husband who had seen them before on television and wanted to see it.  Flight of the Conchords is extremely funny - the wry sense of humor and excellent writing make up for the lack of reality.  The three main characters, Jemaine, Bret and Murray are so sweet and earnest and appealing that I look forward to seeing the show each week and will definitely buy the DVD.",1187049600,34,490,4.258064516129032
2807786,5,B000P2A6C0,"Wasn't expecting much from HBO comedy after Ali G.  I mean, how could you possibly compare or compete with Da Ali G Show?  I never thought I could fall in love all over again but guess what?  These virtually unknown guys known as Jermaine and Brett have me laughing every week and also groovin' to their music.  The show is so funny - even the opening credits are funny.  These guys are truly amazing and they make it all look so effortless. Part of me hopes they stay unknown so we fans can have them to ourselves but they are just too good.  These guys will become well known soon enough.  Love you Brett!",1187049600,12,607,4.271929824561403
2807787,5,B000P2A6C0,"The show follows the lives of a two man digi-folk band from New Zealand who frequently bust out into song. Bret McKenzie (ryhmenosaurus) and Jemaine Clement (Hiphoppopotamus) are the two members of this hilarious duo who move to New York in hopes of being discovered. The other regulars on the show are their equally funny band manager Murray who's real job is working at the New Zealand consulate, their one obsessive fan or fan period Mel who is the president, treasurer, and secretary of their fan club, and Dave, Bret and Jemaine's friend and advisor

It's hard to describe how Flight of the Conchords is so funny in the same way it's hard to describe how certain faces Dwight, Jim, Or Pam make to the camera on The Office are funny. There accents and mannerisms alone are hilarious.

I'd recommend checking out HBO's website click on Flight of the Conchords and check out the lyrics to some of the songs on different episodes, also funny stuff.
I think fans of Seinfeld, The Office, and This is Spinal tap will really enjoy and anyone who gets subtle humor, looking for something fresh.

Flight of the Conchords airs Sundays on HBO at 10:30 following Entourage.

2807792,5,B000P2A6C0,"*****Seriously, what's up with Season 1 Episode 9??? While streaming this episode on Amazon Prime, it didn't play Flight of the Conchords for me, it played a music video of Cookie Monster singing about food... Amazon, FIX THIS PLEASE!!! THANK YOU!!!*****

On to the review... I adore Flight of the Conchords! Seriously, if you haven't yet seen it, go watch their episode on HBO's One Night Stand, Season 5 Episode 4. It's possibly my favorite 30 minutes ever recorded for television, and it was the first thing I've ever seen them in. A hybrid mix of standup comedy and comedic songs, it also demonstrates how really talented they are as musicians... which is easy to forget considering how much they make you laugh. You won't regret watching this! If you do, you have no sense of humor! :)

The first time I tried to watch this series, however, I was disappointed, quite frankly. I just couldn't get into it... it seemed like dull & boring bits interspersed with their awesome music. Well, I'm rewatching it now, and I am thoroughly into it! The humor is very dry, very surreal, and very, very deadpan. And also very smart and clever! I particularly loved a moment when Jemaine was reading a note from Bret that read ""I have gone far far away... to Coco's house."" At face value, it was funny because Coco's house was, clearly, not ""far far away."" But with the added knowledge that the delightful actress Sutton Foster, who played Coco, also played Fiona in Shrek the Musical... then the line takes on a whole new meaning, and it's comedy gold.

Additionally, the music on this show really is outstanding. I love listening to their music on the way to work, or any time I need a pick me up. Their song ""Carol Brown"" (which was nominated for an Emmy award) is absolutely brillliant... so beautiful and so truly funny! :) I just cannot recommend them highly enough!",1490140800,2,1863,4.656534954407295
2807793,5,B000P2A6C0,"Loved it. It does get childish at times but give it a try. The ""Business time"" music video in Ep. 5 was my favorite but there were plenty of other moments of genius and hilarity throughout both seasons.",1489449600,2,202,4.342105263157895

2807881,5,B000P2A6C0,"My love for this show knows no bounds. To start, it's hilarious. Also the characters are endearing and exceedingly likable. And finally the songs are fantastic. I had a friend who has great taste in these things try to get me into the show when it first aired years ago but I was reticent and never gave it a shot for whatever dumb reason I had. I was looking for something - anything - to watch not long ago and another friend recommended ""What We Do In the Shadows"" so I rented that and ended up buying it, making it only the 3rd movie I've ever bought, along with The Big Lebowski and Citizen Kane. I've since added 2001: A Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove to the list, but I digress. Anyway after finding out a bit more about ""What We Do..."" I discovered that one of the guys involved with that movie was one of the guys in ""Flight"" - I'm bad with names, mostly because I don't much care about movie/celebrity types, but anyway... returning to ""Flight...""; I wish they made more, needless to say. I could stand a few more seasons. It is incredibly well written, some of the framing of shots approaches art and in general everything about this show is well done. The characters are never parodies nor ciphers or reduced to one dimensional jokes intended as fodder for a plot device or what have you. Even the minor characters are fully fleshed-out and seem like they'd exist outside the boundaries of the show. All the actors give great performances, from ""Mel"" as the single, devoted fan to John from the Mugging episode (one of the best 30 minutes of viewing I've ever had, that episode specifically.)

2807958,5,B000P2A6C0,"This is by and large, one of the greatest shows to ever grace humanity. For me, it ranks in my interchangeable Top 3 Greatest Shows of All Time, along with the original Twilight Zone series and Game of Thrones. These fellas are comedic and musical geniuses. I have seen them live as well, and they are even better in person. Whenever I'm feeling down or my heart seems to be in a bad place, I watch Flight of the Conchords and my spirits are instantly lifted. Never fails. The comedy is different than what most Americans are used to, I suppose. Nothing very in-your-face or over-the-top. Just mainly dry, absurdist humor. It's crazy silly, but at the same time intelligent. I love everything about it. Except for Mel's Dreams song. Song was good, her performance, not so much. It's the only part I ever fast forward past.

I love these guys (and Murray). I wish they would have continued the series, but I understand why they decided to call it quits, and I love them for that, too. They are still doing great things, both together and as individuals. I suggest you check out what they've been up to; you won't be disappointed. I can watch any episode a million times and it never gets stale. The Bowie episode is easily my favorite. There is no reason this show should be rated anything below 5 stars...",1474588800,4,1305,4.529661016949152

It's sort of a cross between shows like The Office/Parks and Recreation and Tenacious D, while keeping a distinct tone of silly humor mixed with well-crafted cringe humor. Not quite The Office (UK) levels of cringe, but definitely in the same vein.",1474502400,,400,5.153846153846154

Bret and Jemaine act like clueless 15 year old boys trying to navigate their way through the big bad city. Despite being on HBO, the show has a sort of innocence about it. They rarely (if ever) swear, and they basically act like teenagers in their quests to get girlfriends and grow their fan base (which consists of one person). It's really funny!

New Zealanders, Jemaine (Jemaine Clement) and Bret (Bret McKenzie) are struggling musicians / flatmates, trying to make it in New York City. With their heinously inept manager, Murray Hewitt (Rhys Darby), and the -rather creepy- one and only member of their fan club, Mel (Kristen Schaal), Jemaine and Bret endure the untold trials of life outside Kiwi-land. FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS is a subtly zany comedy series, packed w/ suitably absurd situations and silly characters.

The NZ accents alone are worth it--I think they could recite recipes and still be funny. The subtle and not so subtle digs at Australia (""Did she steal your wallet"") are also funny. This is very dry humor that doesn't always have an obvious punchline, so if you like your comedy broad, this is not the series for you. But if you enjoy dry humor, references to all kinds of pop culture heights and follies, plus a big dose of self-deprecation, I highly recommend Conchords.",1429488000,,602,4.532110091743119

2809082,4,B000P2A6C0,"Wasn't sure what to make of this show at first, but after eight episodes it's really grown on me. Brett and Jemaine are clueless musicians even more down on their professional luck than the Monkees, entirely not making it in New York, New York and not likely to under the aegis of their equally clueless manager, Murray. All three are from New Zealand, a not incidental feature, since Brett and Jemaine seem to suffer from permanent cases of jet lag and culture shock and cling to Murray as their one guiding light in an environment Murray is just as lost in. One would think guys like this would go under fast, but the New Yorkers in the part of the city they inhabit aren't paragons of achievement themselves, and the humor comes out of how everyone is pretty much living day by day. When the show engages with issues like crime and racism and gender roles, the set-ups are unabashedly contrived to lead into goofy musical numbers. And if you like outright weirdness, it's hard to beat Jemaine's James Mason-esque impersonation of David Bowie.",1425945600,,1045,4.684782608695652

Be aware you will find yourself talking like Brett and Jemaine for days after binge watching this show.

It's very funny and if you have a mind to you can re-watch it and pretend that Mel (their fan and loyal stalker) is grown up Louise from Bob's Burgers.

It's a sweet and oddly gentle sitcom, nothing too dramatic happens, just fun and relaxing and will crack you up at unexpected times.

We watched the whole show a few years back when it first came out and enjoyed binge watching it just recently.

2809120,5,B000P2A6C0,"Absolutely hilarious.  The show follows the exploits of the two men that make up the titular band.  Flight of the Conchords is a show about two men from New Zealand that make their way to New York City to follow their dreams of being a big-time band in the United States.  Unfortunately, success never find them, and they perform ""gigs"" in oddball places, such as the New York Public Library, attended only by their homely, married ""groupie,"" Mel, who openly flirts with the guys in front of her husband.  Their manager, Murray - portrayed by noted comedian Rhys Darby (a man who knows nothing of the music business or musicians in general), works in the New Zealand consulate, which is noteworthy for being a small office in a tiny office building located above an ""All Asian Massage"" parlor, and provides the framework that establishes much of the plot of each episode.

Most of the situations that the main characters find themselves in are hilariously unbelievable.  Neither one of the guys are particularly exciting as actors, even though both have had measures of success outside of FOTC (Jemaine Clement was Boris the Animal in MIB:3, and voiced the cockatoo in Rio, and Bret McKenzie appearing as ""Figwit""/Lindir in 4 of Peter Jackson's LOTR/Hobbit movies).  All of that aside, however, most of what makes FOTC so entertaining is the somewhat subdued and subtle nature of the jokes delivered by Bret and Jemaine, and the enthusiastic, naive jokes by Murray, and the way they play off of each other.

The budget for the shows is low, or shot so as to appear poor quality, and almost bears a resemblance to some of the ""mockumentary"" works, such as ""This is Spinal Tap"".  The acting is not very good.  The plots are thin and unbelievably odd.  But somehow the show works.  My recommendation, check it out.  If at first you don't like it, watch a couple more episodes.  It'll grow on you, and soon, you'll find yourself scouring youtube looking for FOTC songs.",1424995200,,1965,4.775147928994083

Those music videos remind me of the type of humor and creativity seen in Beastie Boys videos. Sad to see this show only went for 2 seasons but a lot of people probably didn't give it a chance.

My girlfriend has them downloaded on her phone and we listen to them on all our road trips.  Bret is a genius songwriter and Jemaine is just funny.

They are low-key, very low key, and their talent as musicians (as these 2 characters are played) is highly questionable.  They struggle under a pathetically inept and inexperienced band manager, and a stalker / adoring fan (the only fan in their fan club) -- but then, worked into each episode (at least once, sometimes more), are ""pop-out"" musical numbers -- often starting out in the form of the characters drifting off into something like an inner monologue at a particular moment in the story -- in *those* musical numbers, there's no denying the talent these 2 men bring to the show...  Perhaps as the characters they're playing, then, those characters IMAGINE themselves to be this good, in their minds... These pop-out musical numbers are gems, often parodying a recognizable artist or song or genre, and they deserve close listening (and re-listening) for their funny lyrics, visuals, etc.

The whole cast is awesome. It introduced me to the incredibly talented Kristen Schaal, who I have been following ever since. Everyone with the accent is instantly likable, and they constantly make fun of themselves. There is a cameo by one of my favorite stand up comedians of all time, Demetri Martin.

The random songs they break into are usually emulating a popular song from whatever genre fits at the time. They are incredibly witty, and often include subtle jokes you don't even realize are there, and sometimes miss from laughing at the previous line. The great part is, these songs seem to be mostly imagined by one or both of the members, and the music they actually play at gigs is purposefully bad.

2809603,5,B000P2A6C0,This is one of the funniest shows I've seen that really make you dig outside the box and find humor in the ordinary.  It follows two fellow New Zealanders who move to New York to try to make it in the music industry. Their manager is a good hearted guy who's efforts always seem to fall short. You see their struggle not only as muscians but also foreigners in New York. This makes for a great plot but it's their music that really is the cherry on top. I'd recommend anyone watching this.

The humor is so sly, and so dryly delivered that it took me the 2nd time thorough to catch all the brilliance of the comedy. But that makes it even more enjoyable the 2nd time around.

Besides the brilliance of Bret McKenzie & Jemaine Clement, Rhys Darby is hilarious as Murray, the band's hapless manager. And Kristen Schaal, as the desperately trailing Mel, steals almost every scene she's in - much like she does now as the voice of Louise on ""Bob's Burgers"".
There are so many great moments in Season 1, but one of the best has to be the episode, ""Girlfriends"". From the very start of the show where Jemaine wants Bret to go into a bakery with him so that he isn't seen buying a croissant on his own, to when the guys tell Murray about their new girlfriends and he objects, telling them that bands shouldn't have girlfriends, citing Wham! as an example, to near the end of the show when Bret's girlfriend Lisa, who is pressuring him to have a physical relationship, tells him that she's in Delta Force, and she's being deployed to Fallujah tomorrow, that episode was well written from start to finish.

Always living in their own world but pontificating about the world around themtheres that insight conundrum again.  Funny stuff.  I love the Jagger thing Jermaine Clement brings intentionally (he feigns being cocksure) and unintentionally (hes got the bone structure and lips naturally). You gotta love the poster in their managers (for the fan base of 1) office:  New Zealand - Dont Expect Too MuchYoure Gonna Love It!!!

2809621,5,B000P2A6C0,"When Amazon asked me, ""How many stars would you give 'Flight of the Conchords: Season 1'?"" I simply responded (out loud but to myself so everyone could hear) with an interrogative as well, ""Can the stars equal the number of tears of joy that streamed down my face when I saw that FIGWIT had speaking lines before the Elves passed into Grey Havens?""  If they can then I would like to request that Amazon make a Mobius graphic to show the corollary.

I do so miss those brilliant Kiwi musicians...and I mean musicians who are Kiwis (native to New Zealand) and not musicians that play kiwis...but that would be a site to see for sure.

Anyone who has control of all their faculties should take time to watch the whole series.  They will not be disappointed and if they are disappointed then I believe they may have lied about having control over all their facultiesso do more tests!

2809656,5,B000P2A6C0,"One day, on a bus in Ecuador when I was feeling more than a bit sick from traveling, one of my traveling partners had me listen to ""Business Time"" by Flight of the Conchords on her iPod. That did the trick to cheer me up, as we bounced around hairpin corners in the Andes Mts, and I have been a fan ever since. I saw them last summer and laughed for their entire show, even though I knew most of their routines.

I don't have HBO, so only got to see their HBO shows recently after I got Amazon Prime. Wow, it was worth every dime (for this and many other reasons - my shameless plug for A-Prime). I laugh out loud at least 2-3 times during every episode. The plot line is that these two guys from New Zealand play themselves as starving musicians who come to America to try to make it big. They have a type A business manager who is also from New Zealand, and just a single female fan in their fan club who is stalker crazy and gets all dreamy eyed around the boys. Both have made an appearance in every episode thus far (I'm up to episode 6) and I can't wait to watch more. Look for a new poster of New Zealand in Murray's office during their weekly band meetings. The dynamics are great between the guys, and they always play one or two songs to match the action that is going on.

So, if you are looking for some hilarious folk parody that is LOL funny, then give these guys a shot. ""Business hours are over, baby ....""",1402099200,,1422,4.129963898916968

This show will be an acquired taste. If you get the humor you will love it, if not you will hate it. I was introduced to this many years ago by my twenty something daughter and my college age nephew. Think something like Mad Magazine the Musical. Made me blush at times. Bawdy language in and out. But in the days before Glee, it gave me my music fix. The songs are simply hilarious and I think I love the show more for the songs than the plot ( what plot???)

When the series first debuted on HBO in 2007, I was firmly in the ""love it"" camp due to its somewhat twisted yet sharp, dry humor.  I find the songs to be entertaining and witty, the band meetings with Murray to be funny, the acting to be spot on (with a great cast), and the writing to be hilarious.  Interactions with Mel were definite highlights of the show.

2809697,5,B000P2A6C0,"Flight of the Conchords was completely unexpected.  The series tells the story of Bret and Jemaine, two musicians from New Zealand trying to make it in New York. They are not very successful.

Unlike the case in most sitcoms, they live in an apartment that appears socioeconomically appropriate for two struggling musicians.  They are (poorly) managed by a fellow Kiwi whose day job is at the New Zealand embassy.

The series mixes in magical realism and musical interludes, with Bret, Jemaine, and other characters breaking out into plot-related songs and scenarios.  The songs all have a humorous bent, and are exquisitely well-done.

To say that we love this show would be an understatement.  To put it into perspective, I typically do not like musicals, and my favorite musical is 'The Blues Brothers'.  However, I love Flight of the Conchords.  The two leads are engaging and believable, the writing is razor sharp, and the show hit the ground running, and is enjoyable from the first episode of the first season to the last episode of the second season.

Bret and Jemaine pulled the plug on any remaining seasons, and given the amount of creativity poured into the first two I can understand them wanting to take a break before they ran out of steam.  I hope they find a way to come back for more, but in the interim I highly recommend this series.",1376352000,5,1354,4.76824034334764

I'm not good at reviewing, but I thought that this show about the guitar-based digi-bongo acapella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo (fourth most popular in New Zealand...or so they were) and their manager, Murray, were worth it. I didn't like this show too much at first, but I found it very compelling.

So I guess I liked it but I didn't like it at the same time. Like, I watched it, but I didn't want to watch it, but I also didn't want to do anything else at that moment. This is usually how I feel about something (totally conflicted, quite dramatic) before I end up really liking it.

After going back to it for the umpteenth time, I suddenly realized how much I enjoyed it.

2809711,5,B000P2A6C0,"The very first episode is gritty and low budget, but it has a charm to it that you come to miss in the second season.  If you are a fan of music (old R&B, Prince, 80s New Wave) then you'll absolutely love the first season.  The comedy is very subtle, but as you get to know the characters you'll slowly become tuned into the world FOTC.  I've watched the first season many many times over and years later I'm still enjoying the music.  The other characters in the story have just as brilliant comedic timing.  Mel (Kristen Schaal) and her husband are extremely funny and awkward.  Murray and his assistant Greg have a hilarious dynamic between the two of them. Dave (""you're a legend Dave"") is very funny and even brings his own touch to some of the music.  Oddly enough one of my favorite characters is the landlord Eugene.  I've seen him do stand up and its some of the funniest **** I've ever heard.  He's offensive without you having to feel offended because he looks and sounds harmless and yet very intelligent. Anyway his role in FOTC is small, but he makes the most of it.  It just feels like everyone is in tune with the story and world created for them, like they are all just as much apart of FOTC as Brett and Jemaine.  And to top it off the music is very funny and extremely catchy.  I own most of the music as well.  Prince of parties, Kiss is not a contract, Business Time, Ladies of the World all brilliantly funny and yet you can't help but sing them multiple times a day like an idiot.
Off topic: The second season came about after I was already used to the style of music and casual storylines (having watched them over and over) that it took some time to fall in love the second season.  The episode would come on HBO and I'd have to watch it, couple days later watch again, and once more before the next episode would air.  While the story is superior in the first season (yet simple), the music is still just as addicting.  When I say I prefer the first season to the second, thats really just a comparison of steak to lobster.  They're both better than most of the liverwurst that is on TV (or was on).",1332547200,,2125,4.298994974874372

2809727,5,B000P2A6C0,"Jermaine and Bret are a pair of New Zealand musicians, living in New York City and hoping to hit it big. Yeah, ""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete First Season"" sounds like a terrible generic sitcom, but instead this series is one of the most hilarious comedies of the last decade -- a quirky, weird, tongue-in-cheek little show with hilarious dialogue. Think a musical version of ""The Office.""

Folk-pop group Flight of the Conchords is Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (played by themselves), who came all the way from New Zealand to New York. They are being managed by the ineffectual New Zealand Consulate official Murray (Rhys Darby), and they have exactly one fan/stalker, Mel (Kristen Schaal). They don't have many gigs, and even fewer successful ones.

As they chase elusive fame'n'fortune, the guys have to deal with girlfriend woes (dating the same girl, a ""Yoko"", a girl who just wants to use Bret for sex), Bret getting a job, muggings, body image problems, anti-Kiwi racism, a problematic band rock'n'roll tour, two new fans with impure intentions, a semi-professional actor/compulsive liar who makes Murray think they've got a multimillion-dollar deal, and a bongo player who threatens to divide the band.

If I had to come up with a description for ""Flight of the Conchords,"" it would be that they're the folky New Zealand love child of Spinal Tap and ""The Office."" No laugh track, rambling dialogue, and the main characters tend to spontaneously break into song-and-dance at pivotal parts of the plot. And it's brilliant.

The writing is brimming over with effortless weirdness, as the guys encounter everyday problems (threesomes, girlfriend woes, racism) which soon turn into hilariously surreal situations (the disturbing children's show, ""Albi the Racist Dragon""). The dialogue is amazing (""She's a pastry chef and a sniper""), and full of rambling conversations that just get stranger with every line (""Have you ever had a threesome?"" ""Nearly."" ""What do you mean, nearly?"" ""I've had a twosome"").

The songs are gutsplitting as well, since they're all about homicidal robots, mermaids, hermaphrodites (""Oh you sexy hermaphrodite lady-man-ladies""), and the hiphop-potamus. Not to mention ""Frodo, Don't Wear the Ring"" and its accompanying music video, which are a nod to McKenzie's role as the elf Figwit.

But none of this would be even half as funny if it weren't for the actors -- Clement's self-named chatacter is stoic and kind of weird (he writes a song about putting a wig on Bret), while McKenzie's is more childlike, naive and likes to sit in a cardboard box. Darby rounds out the cast as their harried, rather pathetic manager (who isn't even supposed to be managing a band), and Schaal is also quite funny as a woman who has a creepy sexual fixation on the guys.

""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete First Season"" is one of the rarest kind of comedy out there -- steady, hysterical, and only gets better with repeated viewings. Too bad there's only one more season.",1273622400,,3001,5.038306451612903

The wit is similar to British or Australian comedy and seems to go over the head of some American viewers. Season 1, on HBO, is fresh and unique. The group has a tough time creating new material in Season 2 -and seem to be too self-aware. This is one of the brightest comedy/pop culture performances in the last decade. Concords effectively poke fun at the superficiality of dating, romantic ideals, the fetishization of consumerism, artistic angst, pop culture, quest for fame, and often produce better songs than get played in the top 40. It's a great alternative to that raunchy, superficial, male-fantasy BS in Entourage. I'd rather hang out with the Concords any day.",1265068800,3,792,4.788321167883212

2809735,3,B000P2A6C0,"One dimensional juvenile humor good for a few laughs..., but the show is admittedly redundant after watching 4 or 5 episodes. There is plenty of humor to explore in the story's basic plot of two naieve and slightly incompetent Kiwi musicians trying to make it big in NYC...but alas, the same 18 to 25 year old guy jokes and accompanying situations repeat themselves. Every episode. Every episode. The writing becomes complacent, and with it, there is little character development or drive in this show. Ultimately, the viewer ends up waiting for the odd breakout into song, which is the brilliance of Flight of the Conchords. It's hard to care about the two main characters Jemaine and Bret. I'd rather just watch their kitschy, hilarious (and memorable) 3 minute dittys on a variety of inane subjects.
The 2 disc set offers no bonus features, and so the band/show's best parts are ignored. Take FOTC for what it's worth and you won't be too disappointed. I just wonder: can these guys go back to New Zealand with their heads held high...or do they sneak back through Aukland anonymously? I can't imagine real Kiwis who are impressed with this show.

Unfortunately I've only seen three of them, one re-run over and over and two others that just knock me off my feet.
But that's not a problem anymore, just seeing three shows I mean, because when I get paid, if i don't get laid off of my 27 year teaching career in sunny CA, I can order.
And what I ESPECIALLY like is that everything they did was put into the show-with no deleted scenes. I hate DVD's that I have to wade through all these cut scenes wondering if I now know something that went on behind a door I wasn't supposed to sneak up to, put a glass to, and go ahead and listen in, to find out something generally icky or just too much. It usually just leads you to shake your head and know now you know too much through means sideways. If it was supposed to be there wouldn't it be there? I don't know.
Anyway this is free of all that confusion. Watch what you missed on HBO. Order today!

Now why do I love it? Fair enough. Let me count the ways.... Well firstly the characters are so off, so unlike the boring stick Happy Days unfunny predictable  joke comedy of network TV with reference to the same 15 things a group of smelly/smarmy/smarty track going, cigar chomping, aggressive, dank old ""listen to my ego"" driven comics do in doing re-runs of the first few days of TV ...ah...I like it's ""not that."" Nothing like that. There is almost none of that I like. Almost none. Feel sorry for that kind of comic. Smell like my grandma's suitcases. I may be old but we moved on for a reason. That' isn't to say that they didn't do their thing well-Red Skelton I loved. Once.  I like it is driven by something where it might be about how being poor is a drag, people are very quirky, you bought a 2nd cup for your broken down apartment, went over-draft and now have all the power shut off.... laughs aren't necessarily punches in our face with an 18 minute laugh track. It just has this lovely little musical thing going. These two have an excellent ""folk"" act that translated to this form so well. They crack on themselves, America...characters  and love. It's really funny.
It's just funny.
Ok....funny...in the way of why I laugh at kids in a classroom, and passing through things in my days, like the absurdity of a bird flying in the room, kids shrieking, inspectors watching you teach ""to the test"" in the first two days, and a child yelling out ""It's only a bird, it isn't a bat or a dinosaur, relax, if it was a pterodactyl we'd be so dead by now.""
It's kinda like that. Only with a New Zealand accent, agent, songs that are always insane and a very light feel.

I want to order both seasons, man I hope it's renewed. I think the show is brilliant. I'm actually ordering to watch at work, after my class is long home sure, and I'm working late or weekends and want to watch something but do not want to forget to laugh about it all.

Anyone who appreciates the naive and witty character humor of The Office will undoubtably love Flight Of The Conchords.
Two New Zealanders in New York City, struggle to make it big with their band ""Flight Of The Conchords"" under the woefully pathetic direction of their band manager, Murray.  Obsessive fan Mel and clueless friend Dave add just the right touches of quirkiness to this well casted ensemble.

The best part is definitely when Bret and Jemaine break into song!  The songs are wonderful because these guys are actually real musicians, so these are actually good songs.

The fourth, I had to turn off half-way.
Two-dimensional characters (or maybe one-dimensional), the same shtick between those characters, plus juvenile plots and sophomoric development of said plots.

Every single episode that I've seen is half boring, a quarter funny and a quarter annoying.  It seems that that is the recipe that HBO likes to follow for their ""breakthrough"" shows.  The humor here is average, you know that rare moment when SNL gets a sketch right and you chuckle a little, that's the best moments of this show.  Nothing that will make you and your friends cry with laughter hours after the show.  As musician comedians, usually not a fan, the songs are completely hit or miss.  Some of the songs have decent melodies that will stay with you a couple days but other songs are just awful, same goes for the humor, some songs are funny and others have you wondering how they could think they were funny.

I know a lot of people that think this show is awesome, my brother and his friends, and that's fine, but why watch this when you can watch the old HBO Tenacious D episodes, or Mr. Show, or Upright Citizen's Brigade?  On another note, Season 2 is even worse.",1234569600,,1073,4.406091370558376

It is hard to pick a favorite episode since all are so well done.
My only complaint (and it is very minor) is that there are no ""extras"".
It would have been nice to just see the music videos or have access to them without searching through the episodes.  Perhaps in the Season 2 set?  If not for that it would have received 5 stars easily.",1233619200,,544,4.113207547169812

2809779,4,B000P2A6C0,"""Flight of the Conchords"" is a quirky, deadpan HBO series about a pair of New Zealanders, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement, trying to break into the New York music scene. The duo is more funky than any folk singers have ever been, and find themselves in a variety of Spinal Tap-esque situations involving the band, their one fan, Mel, and their incompetent manager, Murray.

The humor here is very dry and delivered in an extremely deadpan manner, so fans of broadbrush or slapstick comedy may not find this to their tastes. People who like wry and intelligent humor will love it. I was especially amused by the episode where the guys were discriminated against by a fruit cart owner because they are New Zealanders (""I don't want our customers complaining that our fruit tastes like New Zealanders."") It couldn't have been resolved better than when the vendor discovers that he was confusing Australians and New Zealanders, ultimately befriending the guys in a horrible case of mistaken identity. Another favorite was the episode where Bret was haunted by visions of David Bowie in his sleep with hilarious results, and the final episode featuring a guest spot by the wonderful Demetri Martin.

Each episode features a couple of short music videos, all of which are over-the-top funny, and are the antithesis of conventional musical productions (thank goodness). The DVD set is well worth owning, but a major complaint is the total absence of extras in a series this recent. If you like offbeat, bizarre comedy, ""Flight of the Conchords"" is well worth checking out.",1227484800,3,1567,4.977099236641221
2809780,5,B000P2A6C0,"This is a hilarious and innovative comedy by two upcoming stars from New Zealand. Their dry sense of humor highlights (and exaggerates) much of what goes on in the male mind.

The two main characters from New Zealand, Jemaine and Bret, try to make it big in the music business in New York.  They deliver an understated, deadpan performance that'll have you itching to re-watch all episodes just to catch the nuances.  Particularly funny is the notable absence of profanity, which is replaced by expressions such as 'mutha uckers' or 'flippin'. These boys disect just about every musical genre out there, not just in their sound, but also in their presentation.  The band, their 'videos' and lyrics are so bad that they're good. What amplifies the show's qualities are all the other characters.  Murray, Mel, Dave - no one can do justice to their contribution in a simple review.  You really have to just watch it.

Since you'll probably love the show if you think the songs are funny, I suggest you youtube it and watch the clips (try Inner City Pressure for starters).

Some of the musical numbers are fantastic especially the Hippoputomus vs Rhinaosurus (spelt wrong I know), which just hits the mark in so many ways.

I recommend picking up a copy of their CD as well as it has 80-90% of the songs featured in the show.

All my friends absolutely love them, though I have a hard time seeing people much younger or older than that going for this kind of humor.

Along with their sense of humor, the fact that they come from New Zealand and play music makes the show all the more appealing.
Even though I don't get HBO, I guarantee that if you're a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm (which I am, by the way) or are simply looking for a laugh, give Flight of the Conchords a try and trust me, you will not regret it.

2809812,5,B000P2A6C0,"My daughter demanded that we watch this series and I have to say that I'm delighted that she did.  This is a truly funny series headed (mainly) by three very, very funny men.  Both Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie are great comedians and good musicians.  In the episodes they never cease being musical while being funny, and never cease to be funny while performing some truly enjoyable songs.  But even so Rhys Darby has a pesky habit of stealing scenes as their manager Murray.  The main cast is rounded out by Kristen Schaal, who plays their ""fan base"" aka Mel.  As the founder of the Flight of the Conchords Fan Club (and apparently its only member) she is wonderful as she paws and openly fantasizes about them, usually in front of her husband, who drives her about as she tracks the adventures of our heroes.

There really is not a lot to the show.  The stories are simple.  The cast of characters small.  But each week they manage to create enough of a pretext for Jemaine and Bret (not to mention Murray) to stage some very, very funny scenes.  Both Jemaine and Bret maintain a very subtle style of comedy, both highly skilled at deadpan humor.  Definitely take the time and effort to give these discs a viewing.",1213401600,,1221,4.5504587155963305

Their musical diversity is amazing and their lyrics are outrageously funny. The first time I watched I laughed so much that I missed half the show and had to go back and watch again.

We eagerly awaited delivery of the DVD set with interest piqued by the abundant clips of their videos to be found in the wild, and boosted further by locating CDs of the guys from abroad.

When it finally arrived, the show was everything we hoped for, and more.

However, this DVD set contains only the show, presumably cut just about as it originally aired. What it is missing is any sort of bonus or extra material. Even a gallery of production stills would be welcome. Nearly every other TV series set I've come across has at least one episode with an interesting commentary track, or a blooper reel, or at least one behind the scenes documentary.

Despite that urge to see more, I still can't bring myself to rate the set at anything other than all five stars.",1211500800,2,905,4.608695652173913

I didn't originally catch these episodes as they were broadcast because I didn't know when it was on and never bothered to look.  After watching the first couple episodes on DVD, I became a fan.

The two Conchords are so sweetly dim that you can't help but love them.  Jemaine Clement is a standout as ... Jemaine Clement.  The way he manages to be so deadpan in every scene makes the character (though even he seems on the verge of losing his composure once or twice.)  I'd probably be disappointed to see him laughing and carrying on in real life.  Not really.

If the show just featured Clement and McKenzie, it'd be good enough but we're lucky to get an amazing supporting cast.  Rhys Darby and Kristen Schaal are comic gems, and Arj Barker as Dave makes idiocy adorable.

I'm glad to hear that HBO will be having a second season. Will it match the hilarity of the first?  I have confidence.

2809820,5,B000P2A6C0,"Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement are two New Zealanders who, together, make up Flight of the Conchords, New Zealand's fourth most popular folk band. In truth though, their music is of the novelty kind that imitates pretty much everything out there, though not all at once and not as blatantly as someone like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic (though he is awesome too!). Their new HBO hit comedy series, which shares the band's name, follows the guys as they try to make it big here in the States. Helped little by well-intentioned New Zealand consulate employee Murray acting as the band's inept manager, naive Bret and desperate Jemaine never seem to have any luck increasing their fanbase beyond one member, the possibly dangerously obsessed Mel, or finding love of any kind to be happy about. The witty banter and awkward situations bring regular laughs throughout the series so far, but the real highlights are undoubtedly the musical numbers. In fact, this is truly a musical TV show. Every episode sees at least two hilarious songs performed as part of the story. Now renewed for a second season, I certainly hope the boys can keep this fantastic show up to the level of its first. The episodes in this complete first season 2-disc DVD set are:

Disc 1:

Sally: Jemaine finds himself dating Bret's old girlfriend, who is really too hot for either of them. Especially funny songs in this one. A fantastic first episode.
Bret Gives Up the Dream: Bret gets a sign holding job because the guys need money, but Jemaine feels Bret is turning his back on the band.
Mugged: When Jemaine and Bret get mugged, Bret manages to get away, causing everyone to look down on him for leaving his best friend behind.
Yoko: Jemaine and Murray consider Bret's new girlfriend from work to be a threat to the band's unity.
Sally Returns: Jemaine thinks he is getting back together with Sally, and her return to their lives causes Bret to want another shot at her too, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend.
Bowie: A depressed Bret begins dreaming of an advice giving David Bowie from various incarnations in his career. Truly, this is one of the best episodes, as others have said.

Disc 2:

Drive By: Murray falls in love with the leggy tech-support girl and gets to sing his own hilarious ballad while Bret and Jemaine have a race war with a racist fruit vendor across the street.
Girlfriends: Bret and Jemaine get girlfriends, amazingly, but it turns out they are only interested in one thing. Well, one of them isn't interested in the guys at all. Love the French song in this one, and I'm sure I've seen the sexy blonde in some of Cinemax's after hours stuff.
What Goes on Tour: Murray takes the boys on tour and discovers just how ""rock 'n' roll"" they really are.
New Fans: When Bret and Jemaine get two new fans who are a bit on the wild side, the guys have to decide just how far they are willing to go.
The Actor: Bret and Jemaine hire an actor to pretend to be a record producer and boost Murray's self esteem while simultaneously rejecting the band. This backfires, of course.
The Third Conchord: Murray brings a third wheel into the band, and the Conchords soon split into two pairs, separating Bret and Jemaine. It doesn't last long, of course, but the end is still quite a surprise.

His heart is in the right place, but he's not much of a manager. He works for the New Zealand consulate and holds the band meetings in his office, and doesn't get them many gigs, or gets them really bad ones.

There are some extremely funny moments, and the songs are funny as well and very well filmed as well.  It's not the greatest thing ever made (as some of its fans have said), but it's a hell of a lot funnier and creative than most dreck you see nowadays, and it's never boring, despite its low key style.  Some of the jokes are so subtle that it took me a few minutes to realise that there was one, but when I did, I laughed quite heartily.  It's also nice to see something shot in NYC that's not restricted only to Manhattan.  I live in NYC, and I get tired of all the Manhattan-centric TV shows and films.  The boys live in Brooklyn, and honestly, most struggling artists in this city live in the outer burroughs, as Manhattan's rents are ridiculously high (bring back rent control!).

The dry, deadpan humor of Flight of the Conchords is balanced out brilliantly by the creative and zany situations the characters find themselves in each episode.  And then there's the music.

The show is technically a musical, with an average of 2-3 songs in each episode.  The songs, for the most part, are figments of Bret and Jemaine's over-active imagination.  They are the real gems of the show.  Each song is quirky, brilliant and captures the true essence of every genre of music they emulate.

The characters are fun and you get the impression that the actors behind their characters aren't much different.  There is a quasi-linear plot that ties episodes together, but you're never sure where each episode will end up taking you.

I personally love this show, but hesitate to recommend it to everyone.  I watched a few episodes with my in-laws over the holidays, and it was clear that they didn't ""get it.""  I think there is a definite generational gap in the humor here and I'll go out on a limb and say I wouldn't recommend this to people over 40.  There are exceptions of course, but you have to be pretty familiar with dry humor and often times bizarre, nonsensical situations.

2809852,4,B000P2A6C0,"Like Arrested Development, this simply a great show that is grossly underrated.  The show takes place in NYC with them playing dumbed downed versions of themselves and the adventures they have in NYC trying to break into the music scene with their inept manager, Murray, and their one obsessive fan, Mel.  Flight of the Conchords however, are more of, you either love it to death, or you don't get it.  As the former I think this is one of the most funny shows on last year, and while I hear they are signed to do a second season I sure hope it happens, though sadly I can't see the show lasting longer than three seasons.  However, if you have seen any of their act, via, YouTube, or whatever, the show is like that, but 10x better.  All of the episodes are written with the songs in mind and every episode they will leave a situation related to a song and break into the song, which is even more funny in a visual context.  The downside of this two disk set is the complete lack of bonus materials of any kind, including their songs as just audio files, or any commentary or interviews, which in my opinion would have made this a 5 star product.  Most people buying this I assume would already be fans of the show, and would probably like the additional bonus of extra features,  however this is an amazing show, and all 12 episodes over two disks are excellent.

2809855,3,B000P2A6C0,"Maybe I am showing my age, maybe I just don't get it, but I was rather disappointed with the ""Flight of the Conchords"" season one.  For starters, I had never heard of this show prior to receiving an email from Amazon offering this to me based upon my prior choices.  The brief review that was posted with the offer had glowing reviews of the show and I must admit it did sound clever, funny and different.  But that was not what I found when I started the DVD.
I went into this with an open mind and a rather high expectation.  After watching the first two episodes I could sense a pattern coming on and it never breaks out of the two or three sub plots that run throughout each episode.  Bret and Jermaine both want to totally consume the girl that they are with but will not let the other guy be with a female alone....what is that all about?  If I am not completely mad, or senile, young guy's live for young girls...period....They are totally consumed by the thought of girls.  Murray is much too simple and predictable.  Why is their one and only fan so openly fawning over the two guys in front of her husband?  And why does he not get what is going on.  Funny once, but 3 times a show, it loses its humor.  I enjoy the way they intermingle the music into the situation, in fact if there was more of that I would have enjoyed this more.  In fact, that is the one and only endearing feature of the show.
Like I said, I think that I may be too old to get this (a 58 year old that feels and acts like a 25 year old) the way it is intended.  Most people think that I criticize movies two much because I expect a certain amount of reality in them (obviously, action, si-fi, comedy's and such don't qualify).  But this one is just too stupid and predictable for me to really enjoy.  Yes, it did not cost a lot of money, but I think that money could have been better spent.",1203552000,3,1872,4.161111111111111

If you love well written comedy such as Seinfeld and The Office(UK)or standup in the likes of Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais then you'll probably love this too.

Brett and Jermaine(the ladies man)are too loveable characters as is their optimistic Band manager/NZ cultural Attache,Murray.
The support characters are excellent too from Mel ""the fan/stalker"" to Dave ""the friend""...everyone is given great rolls and funny lines.

Every episode has at least one song, and they are all classics...get the music too and put a smile on your face.

We re-watched a couple of episodes the other night with some friends visiting from Australia who had not seen FOTC ...at the the end of the first episode we watched(New Fans) my Australian friend looked across at me with tears down his face and said  ""F%*#!, that was funny!""....

The casting really makes the show -- the band's supporting cast mates are very loveable and they play their roles with just the right amount of understatement at times or with just the right amount of schtick when appropriate.

I'm glad that I got this because HBO is not airing the episodes regularly anymore.  Some were on On Demand but that had been inconsistant as well.

2809868,5,B000P2A6C0,"After seeing just a single episode, I knew this show was brilliant.

After seeing the entire first season many times over now, I can say without a doubt it is one of my favorite shows of all time. It's especially strange that the show has had so little marketing behind it -- it feels more or less like an afterthought from HBO -- when in fact it's one of the best things they've produced in years.

Flight of the Conchords are, of course, most famous for their YouTube fodder 3-minute musical sketches -- but I think those only scratch the surface of their comedic talent. The interstitial sketches are hilarious, and stories from episode to episode are universally golden.

There isn't a weak performance in the bunch. There's little to say other than that if you like sardonic, idiosyncratic humor, you won't be disappointed.

The episode ""Girlfriends"" is my personal favorite.

2809869,5,B000P2A6C0,"My favorite thing about this show is that they let you figure things out for youself.  There are recurring themes and situations, but they are subtle and are left for the viewer to figure out.  Like in one episode we learn that Mel is a junior professor of psychology, and that her husband used to be the senior professor of psychology at the same university.  Several episodes later, we learn that Mel met her now-husband when he was her prof and she his student and that she fell in love with him and stalked him.  As she puts it, ""I always get what I want,"" and we can now infer why her husband is no longer the senior professor of psychology at that university...

Also, Jemaine and Bret are hilarious and their squabbles in Murray's office are hilarious and the songs are priceless.  I especially love the song ""If you're into it,"" which is able to be sweet at the same time as it is, well, lewd.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Distant-Future/dp/B000SM7QSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Distant Future</a>",1201478400,,1059,5.127906976744186

The show is comic genius (granted, the humor style may not be for everyone). It's a different kind of humor. If you are not too keen on the Monty Python stuff, this may not be for you.

My beef with the DVD is that all you get are 12 episodes. No Extra Features. No Commentaries. No Deleted Scenes. No information about how the series came about (watching the mini documentary on the ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" DVD was very interesting. I would have like to see something like this here too). You would think that some of their taped live performances would have made it on this disc, but no. This is incredibly disappointing because when they do their songs live, it's even funnier than the show. There's nothing but subtitles and alternate language soundtracks. I would have expected more.

Also, as you get to the last episode, the Conchords obviously ran out of material. I heard a rumor that this season used most of their existing material, and it shows in the last episode. It's also fairly obvious that a lot of the working in of their material was a little forced. Still funny, but forced. What I would like to see in the next season is that they would write some material specifically for the show, and not force existing songs into a story line. I think that this would make the show even funnier than it is now. Hopefully the next season (which I hope there will be one) will be even funnier and quench our thirst for bonus features.

2809891,5,B000P2A6C0,"Flight of the Conchords follows the lives of two NZ musicians (Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie) who are trying to create a life for themselves in New York. The band doesn't have their act quite together, their managers ""real"" job is at the NZ Consulate (conveniently located below ""All Asian Massage""), the band has one fan and they are hoping for a gig at the aquarium. The plot is humorously intertwined with fantasy music videos that parody the 1980's and 1990's MTV music video hey day. (Think Flashdance).

The humor here is quite kiwi, which is excellent, but over the head of people who can't find NZ on a map. This show is going to appeal to the same kind of people who like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extras-The-Complete-Series-Includes-Series-Finale/dp/B000YI99IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extras - The Complete Series (Includes Series Finale)</a>&nbsp;or have traveled a bit. The show quite rightly points out in a humorous way that a lot of Americans don't understand anything about NZ beyond&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>. Promotional posters on the wall of the NZ consulate proclaim ""NZ-It's Not Part Of Australia"" because many Americans confuse the two countries. (Watch for clever details like this in this show because they are a real joy.) My favourite episode has Jemaine and Bret fighting a race war with a fruit vendor who leaves a piece of stabbed kiwi fruit on their door on top of the note ""Die Kiwi's"". When they discover that the fruit vendor actually hates them because he has them confused with Australians (""you're accents are so much the same""-they're not) , the group makes up by running past the Australian embassy giving the building ""the bird"" much to the dismay of the Australian guard. It's a hilariously funny way to illustrate the fact that NZers are tired of living under the Australian shadow. I think Flight of the Conchords is only going to add to the trend of NZ coming into its own.

Kudos to HBO for once again creating an excellent show. Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie have said they couldn't get this show made in NZ and now they are glad because TVNZ would have just ""tvnzed it""-made it bland. The show was apparently ""too kiwi"" for TVNZ. The only shows TVNZ makes are copies of American TV shows. It's true that NZ has a long history of neglecting its own talent which is why so many NZ artists don't object with they are labeled Australian ( Keith Urban&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greatest-Hits/dp/B000WM72IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greatest Hits</a>, Sam Neil, Russell Crowe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Crowded-House/dp/1423452704/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Crowded House</a>-all kiwis labeled Australians by the American media). But in all fairness this show wouldn't have been made at any of the major American networks either. I can imagine the guys at ABC saying ""we can't understand their accent"", ""we won't be able to sell it on the Australian aftermarket because it makes fun of Australians and the advertisers won't like it"", etc etc.  HBO and HBO only has the guts to bring this sort of witty and truly funny series to the screen for which I am grateful.

That being said, HBO didn't bend over backwards to give anything extra to fans in this DVD collection. You are buying the show only here. No commentaries, interviews, or out takes. You could have recorded this on your digital recording device. I still love owning it, but would have liked to have heard some witty commentary over some of the episodes. I think it would have been hilarious to hear Jemaine and Bret talk about some of the scenes. I've also wondered if any of these experiences are based on the experiences of Crowded House and was hoping for some clarifying interviews with this DVD, but alas, you get nothing.

Until that's released, you're pretty much stuck with this.

On the other hand, for someone who's never heard the songs prior, this is absolutely hilarious...

2809905,5,B000P2A6C0,"The first exposure I had to The Flight of the Conchords was a youtube clip of their stage performance of ""Business Time"".  By the time I'd watched all their songs (at my computer) from their concert performance sitting on two wooden barstools with acoustic guitars, I was hooked.  Discovering their HBO series on this DVD set was like finding a treasure.  Seeing them perform all these songs (a total of 27) as full-length music videos in every genre of music under the sun (from rap to salsa) with full production value and effects was even more hilarious than watching them sitting on two bar stools singing (which was pretty hilarious in itself)...  Featuring some surprise players (like Eugene Mirman as their landlord, and the B-52's Kate Pierson in a brief appearance as a club owner), the music videos are reminiscent of Michael Nesmith's (of The Monkees fame) entertaining solo video releases from the '80s (check out his video release ""Elephant Parts"").  The Flight of the Conchords is worth the price of admission for the songs alone, but the dialogue and the characters in the series keep me watching these episodes over and over, and it never ceases to be funny.  While the occasional storyline might be best suited for the over 15 age group (a couple storylines include drug & sex references), my 17-year old novelty musician son has found a kindred spirit in Brett and Jemaine.

2809947,3,B000P2A6C0,"I'm sitting here, feeling just ever so slightly empty.

""Flight of the Conchords - The Complete First Season"" arrived last night, pried from the cold, clammy embrace of Amazon.com into my loving grasp due to a pre-order fixation I have when it comes to television offerings I find life-affirming.

""Flight of the Conchords"" was easily my sole Must-See TV show of the past twelve months. To those inclined to listen, I describe the HBO series as what would happen if you gave Wes Anderson a sitcom, and told him ""by the way...also make it a musical.""

Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie have been performing as Flight of the Conchords (""New Zealand's fourth most popular folk-rock act"") for several years now, but it took the 12-episode series to throw me head over heels in love with the brilliant, dry wit that seems to flow so effortlessly from much of their material. If you're not familiar with their music, a quick pop over to YouTube will lead you to dozens of clips, both performed live and from the show itself.

Songs like ""Beautiful Girl"" and ""Jenny"" (the latter not used on the sitcom) are terrifically well written. The ease with which Bret and Jemaine throw off lines like ""Looking 'round the room/I can see that you/Are the most beautiful girl in the..."" (pause) ""...room..."" (pause again) ""...In the whole wide...room"" with impeccable timing is really quite remarkable. But these aren't throwaway tunes: the music itself is crafted with sure pop precision. Give them some sappy lyrics instead of their hilariously deadpan ones, and the licks and hooks of either song would surely make them hits for some faceless rockster who took life far more seriously than the Conchords ever would.

What really defined the show, though, was the surreality with which the songs were slipped into the episodes. New and inventive, many segues were great to watch simply for their own sake. The addictive faux-French pop of ""Foux De Fa Fa,"" for example, begins when Jemaine simply asks for a croissant at a New York Ciy bakery, and dissolves into a dayglo world of 60s/70s Paris the moment he repeats the order. Fabulous.

The Conchords' ""naifs in New York"" schtick works well for them, and isn't a huge stretch from the calculated cluelessness of their on-stage personas. The opening dialog of the first episode neatly set the tone for nearly everything that was to follow:

Jemaine: Man, back in New Zealand I was getting it on with lots of chicks.

Bret: Who?

Jemaine: Well, ah, Sarah Fitzpatrick...Michelle Fitzpatrick...Claire Fitzpatrick... the list goes on.

Bret: That was all of them.

Jemaine: Well, triple figures.

Bret: No that's not triple figures. That's three.

Supported by equally off-kilter secondary characters (Mel, who makes up their entire ""fan-base""; Murray, their manager; Dave, their best friend), the Conchords created a series that was innovative, quirky and hilarious. In short, I almost yelped with glee when I found out the series was renewed for a second season.

Sure, a few notes fell flat every now and then. But ten of the twelve episodes remained on my Tivo long after they crammed my Tivo's memory to the bursting point (Yes, I was cheap when I first got into Tivo, and unwisely bought their least expensive model. Steam-powered, I believe, my machine has the hard drive capacity of shiny new penny).

Hence, picking up the First Season DVDs meant I could empty my Tivo and finally record, say, something more substantial than the occasional Long John Silver's commercial.

It was with no small amount of geeky glee that I feverishly ripped open the package yesterday, wanting to pop it right into the player to surprise the Lovely and Talented Judith when she got home. (We also finally installed the ice-maker in the freezer, but I thought the Conchords should take top billing for the day's achievements.)

Yet, minutes after looking quickly through it...and playing it just to make sure...the collection left me gutted, if only in a teeny, tiny disappointed whiny fanboy kind of way. The way you really never want to get because of a mere DVD.

To the point: there's not a single extra on either CD.

Let me repeat that: not...one...single...extra.

No commentaries. Not interviews. Not even a single song from the ""One Night Stand"" special the duo did for HBO, which, goodness knows, they should have had the rights to toss in there. Even Mel's video blog, updated regularly on the web site, could have been chucked in there as a bone. C'mon, guys...we're dying for new material here!

Of course, the situation was actually worse with another DVD I'd recently been anticipating: ""Anthony Bourdain No Reservations,"" which not only contains nary a single extra, but on its four (!) discs offers a scant eight episodes - not even a full season's worth! Now, if there's anyone's commentary I'd love to hear, it would be Bourdain's behind-the-scenes takes. In the immortal (and somewhat appropriate) words of Bluebottle, however, there's not a sausage.

Do entertainment companies owe us extras? Have we become so spoiled by the likes of ""The Lord of the Rings"" that we unrealistically expect more, more MORE from each and every new release? Does our Supersize Culture extend to expectations that our DVDs, likewise, should be bloated with bonus footage?

Lord knows, there have been releases where I could have done without the ""deleted scenes."" I mean, let's face it: for the most part, they were deleted for a reason.

Still, I'd have appreciated even a modicum more thought behind the DVD of a show as fresh and original as ""Flight of the Conchords.""

So here I sit, enjoying every second of what's on the discs, yet wishing there was more. Loving the duo that created such classic bits as ""Business Time"" and ""Boom King,"" yet also -- as has been already stated -- feeling ever so slightly heartbroken.

And wondering what it is we should realistically expect from entertainers we give our hearts and/or minds -- if even only occasionally, at any rate -- to.",1194480000,38,5999,4.903162055335969
2809948,3,B000P2A6C0,"First of all: let me start by saying I give the actual show, and these guys 5 stars. This show is hilarious, and I love it.
The reason I'm only giving the DVD 3 stars is that there are NO extra features AT ALL! Nothing! The stuff on the DVD is exactly what was on TV, no extras, no deleted scenes, no commentaries, no nothing.
This came as a bit of a disappointment, for a fan who's been awaiting this release so we could get MORE Conchords!
What about some interviews? Extra footage? Life of Murry? Maybe even a snippet (or perhaps the whole thing) from the appearance they did on HBO's One Night Stand, which was amazing and funny and is available nowhere.

I mean come on... nothing? Really?

So if you've never seen the show, or missed a few episodes, if you do not have HBO and just want to see what you've missed - by all means: I highly recommend this series.

Actually live in the same town (the capital city -- Wellington) that these guys ply their trade in when they're not doing their thing in NYC. Saw Bret when I was walking home from work the other week -- very cool.

It's amazing that they've had to go half way around the world to make it because Jermaine Clement has been part of the New Zealand acting scene for years now.  They've obviously hit their pay dirt with Conchords and good luck to them.  We totally crack up watching these episodes which are showing for the first time over here in late 2007.

It's great to see so many Americans giving them positive reviews.  I hope they continue their excellent writing and mad, brilliant songs in the 2nd season which I believe HBO have granted to them.

I particularly loved the episode where the Indian guy mistakes them for Australians and is racially prejudiced towards them.  Kiwifruit nailed to their flat door -- hilarious.  Kiwis would probably have to be the race least likely to suffer racial prejudice, hence the joke.

Hope you guys enjoy the next season as much as we're looking forward to it down under.",1194307200,2,1187,4.556603773584905

BUT - the redeeming factor is that, this show is a bit of an underdog - so to purchase it would send a message that we definitely need MORE FOTC.  So I bought it anyway.",1194307200,14,382,3.858974358974359

The songs are straight up funny, but most of the other laughs simply come from the interaction between Murray, Bret, and Jemaine.  They are clueless in the ways of the world thinking that leather suits, goatees (Murray doesn't like it but he thinks it makes him more ""rock and roll"" which caused Jemaine to tell Murray he looked like a goat), and getting whacked-off on drugs are cool.

What makes this a brilliant show is the understated nature of the two stars and the transformation of their personalities when they break out into song. The music is well-written and quite varied in style and genre, the acting first-rate and the scripts beyond clever.

Dry, wry, witty and just downright fun. Buy it. Watch it. Listen.",1191542400,6,402,4.826086956521739
2809959,5,B000P2A6C0,"I have watched every episode of this wonderful HBO series probably 15+ times (through the joy of On Demand) and still want the DVD for my very own. The combination of dry, clever wit and hilarious, innovative music parody is perfect.

Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (the real-life and TV-ized FotC), along with James Bobin, have created a charming, sweet look at two naive Kiwis trying to make it as a band in NYC, throwing in just enough raunch and innuendo to make it appetizing to Americans.

The Conchords wisely surrounded themselves with a wide array of NY comics who pop up in just about every episode: their best friend, Dave (the beautifully off-color Arj Barker); their lone fan (played perfectly by Kristen Schaal); their gorgeously intrusive landlord (Eugene Mirman); and special appearances by the likes of John Hodgman, Demetri Martin, Todd Barry, and Will Forte (the weakest appearance, but still in a great episode).

Their band manager, Murray (the lustrous-haired Rhys Darby), deserves his own paragraph. Rhys steals just about every scene he is in. He and the Conchords have a great chemistry and play well off each other. His band roll call never gets old.

Woven throughout their rather mundane (but entertaining to the viewer) existence are music videos, most exhibiting the actors' inner dialogs. While it may sound a little hokey, the transitions from reality to music and back are expertly done for the most part.

Dry, sometimes quirky humor may not appeal to everyone, but if it appeals to you, you should check this out!",1191369600,7,1551,4.972972972972973

2809962,5,B000P2A6C0,"This is, unfortunately for me right now, one of those shows that you just need to see to understand. I recommend checking out some of their live stand-up/music routines on YouTube to get a taste of their humor.

The show itself is  sort of a unique sitcom with comedic music videos mixed in to the story. For me, the funniest scenes are actually during the dialog scenes, and not so much the music (even though the music is hilarious). The writing is extremely clever, and the acting is even better. It's hard to sit through a scene with Jermaine, Bret and their manager Murray without laughing - the chemistry is perfect.

I'm excited to see this coming out on DVD so soon and for so cheap. Flight of the Conchords made my summer, and this DVD is probably the best $20 you'll spend this year.",1190937600,,793,4.455172413793103

Instead, they remain innocent and likeable, which is one of the main attractions to the show.  I wish I could give season one 5 stars, but unfortunately, as if they started to run out of material, the show began to bottom out and became less and less funny (although still creative).",1189728000,9,506,4.239583333333333
