5168261,2,B008JENBLO,"With the increase of sightings of the Mokele Mbembe in the Congo, a group of British adventurers and scientists take out to find them. Jonathan (Richard Dillane) is the leader of the group, while his undisciplined electronic whiz son Luke (Matt Kane) comes along as a stowaway. Natasha ""tank top"" Loring provides some early eye candy. Amara (Abena Ayivor) is their local guide who knows more than what she tells. There are others too.

On their way to the location, their helicopter is taken down, as it seems they are not designed to withstand an impact from a single pterodactyl. Once on the ground, more CG critters are encountered.

On the plus side we get to see the dinosaurs early in the film and don't have to wait until the last frame. The CG dinosaurs are a cut above the rubber head ones previously used in that Area 51 downed plane film. There are still problems with the hand held genre. Luke's at home stationary mounted camera shakes, zooms, and pans on its own. I think this would have been a better production if they were to have a limited use of this hand held genre within the film. It just doesn't work.

The acting wasn't that great as I found myself yearning for the return of Jeff Goldblum. I kept hoping a dinosaur would bite the head off Matt Kane as I grew weary of his facial close-ups and idiotic comments. The day after the crew was attack by dinosaurs, Luke uses his camera to lament about his relationship with his father. HEY LUKE! You were just attacked by dinosaurs!

Writer and director Sid Bennett squandered a great opportunity to make a quality film.

Parental guide: No f-bombs (for a change) sex, or nudity. Not worth the rental fee.",1364083200,,1674,4.566666666666666
5168262,3,B008JENBLO,"At first sight ""The Dinosaur Project"" looks like a modern-day version of Conan Doyle's classic ""The Lost World"" shot in a found-footage style, but the truth is the UK film is more like a rehash of ""Anaconda."" Directed by Sid Bennett (""Prehistoric Park""), ""The Dinosaur Project"" (his feature debut) is a mildly entertaining adventure film, though I suspect the film would have been better without the narrative device that has been overused in the film industry these days.

The story is a standard one with stock characters you have seen somewhere else. A British expedition team led by an adventurous zoologist Jonathan Merchant (Richard Dillane) travels deep into the Congo jungle looking for ""mokele mbembe,"" legendary creature that has been recently sighted. (The legend itself really exists.) However, an accident happens, and the remaining members including Jonathan's trouble-making son Luke (Matt Kane) get stranded in the middle of the jungle.

""The Dinosaur Project"" employs a shaky documentary-looking style, trying to increase realism, but I think the film does it too often. The on-location photography (shot in South Africa) is beautifully done, and the special effects of creatures are decent, but the story is uninteresting and the direction uninspired. Characters, especially annoying Luke, sometimes do incredibly stupid things. Feeding a little dinosaur is not something you are supposed to do when lost in the Congolese jungle.

The film is mindless fun, but obviously it needs something more than clichd storyline. The camcorder-type shooting alone is not enough to make a truly interesting adevnture movie when most audiences are getting more and more cynical about the technique. To be a more successful adventure film (like ""Troll Hunter""), ""The Dinosaur Project"" needs something else, like more humor and much more suspense.",1363478400,,1849,5.413194444444445

I had expected a ""Jurassic Park""-style action movie of some sort, all I was treated to was a British afternoon drag. Too much talking and slow motion, not enough action. The somewhat realistic dinosaur computer graphics saved this movie.

5168270,5,B008JENBLO,"This is definitely the best dinosaur movie since Jurassic Park.
J.P was the first step in making the ultimate dinosaur movie, both intelligent, with perfect give-away atmosphere and those movies are an eye-candy. This movie was the best of the rest. Nothing took Jurassic park movies from it's 1st place, but the second place is definitely for this movie.

The story was okay, because it is hard to believe in a place where dinosaurs somehow survived. Not just one or 2 of them, but plenty of species, including flying ones. And as soon as we have them it is hard to believe that this will remain a secret for long. The movie has a potential, and there could be done a second sort of chapter for the movie.

Acting was great and actors were good. Did not fell in love with any of them and I think the son and father relationship was a little too much. I mean I did not like it. Sure that shows a picture of who is who, but I still think it was just too much.

Dinosaurs models are just good, not just some bad CGI models, but they are really good, when comparing them to other dinosaur movies.

I would give the movie 4 stars if not the twisted (sort of) ending. I found myself with lots of questions on what will happen next, and I enjoyed the twist (the last 10 minutes) more, than the rest of the movie. It sort of got me right there.

Also there is a relationship with dinosaur, that really made the movie stand out. It's not something I expected to see and like. Usually it's bad CGI models that I see in other movies, but here it was not the same.

I'm upset that this movie is not on blu-ray yet or even dvd region 1 (though I use region 1 &2 dvds). The reason for that is that even though IMDB gave it a low rating, like plenty of times before I find myself in situation when I either believe the ratings and miss the movie or I watch it anyway. I am glad I did not look at IMDB ratings before I finished the movie. I suddenly got really upset when I saw them.

Do yourself a favor and do not read any ratings and reviews for the movie. Just buy it and see for yourself.

I am an experienced movie watcher. I love plenty of movies, and when I say this is not a bad movie, I really mean it.",1350691200,15,2197,4.128805620608899

The cast was good considering I didn't recognize them, the technology of the filming was better than almost any ""found film"" I've seen and the sound was very good. The captioning was off quite a bit but that's what happens when the captioner doesn't have the same accent as the actor ( saying whatever instead of white water), but that is very minor.

5168327,3,B008JENBLO,"After a couple of days of binging on $30 worth of B dinosaur movie DVDs, I have to say that this one was the best of the lot. Compared to the others, the actors could actually act, the dialog wasn't stilted and choppy as in most of the other productions, the storyline was clear (to me), and the filming was remarkably good. Yes, for some viewers, the film technique of using body-cams is distracting but I felt that the black-out periods and electronic noise added to the realism associated with that technology.
If you are looking for a Spielberg productionthis isn't it but, with the exception of a couple of scenes with the larger dinosaurs, the animation is rather believable. Contrary to what the jacket depicts, there is no T-Rex stomping around in this one but that is to its credit as it isn't attempting to be Jurassic Park. One of the films that I screened yesterday ripped-off bits of dialog, word-for-word, from Jurassic Park and even had a scene where the dinosaurs (velociraptors) cornered the humans in a commercial kitchen and one of them tried to hide in the walk-in freezer room.

5168330,4,B008JENBLO,"The Dinosaur Project is a fictional documentary along the same lines as the Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity concerning mini personal camcorder equipment showing all the visuals in the film, except it's more of a thriller with dinosaurs running around instead of ghosts, not to mention much MUCH better and suspenseful than either of those two films.  The timing of watching this movie is pretty good considering the recent extraordinary success of the new Jurassic Park movie (called Jurassic World) and the fact I'm celebrating 10 years of owning/playing Dino Crisis 2 on the Playstation, one of the greatest video games ever.

Some of the dinos we see while watching the Dinosaur Project are really aggressive and dangerous while others have a compassionate, almost dog-like way about their behavior.  This makes it interesting whenever the British explorers encounter dinosaurs, because there's suspense and wonder how they're going to react to people.  Also it's worth noting that the British explorers aren't all on the same page.  One of them is secretly crooked with his or her own agenda.  I won't spoil who!  That's another quality and surprising element to the writing.

I was originally *extremely* skeptical to watch this movie based on the whole documentary/thriller blend that's (thankfully) not become the norm in movie writing.  There was a time I was really worried the Blair Witch Project and the like was the wave of the horror future.  I'm glad it's not- we need traditional horror movies too.  Not that the Dinosaur Project is a traditional movie since the whole ""documentary meets thriller"" genre is quite unique, but it's done here way more remarkably than most.  Anyway the Dinosaur Project has its share of suspense and decent characters.  The main characters involve a father and son.  Basically the son is boisterous and can't wait to go on the adventure, but his father understands the dangers and tries to encourage him to stay home.

Visually this movie has its stunning moments, and this is one of those rare occasions where blending documentary elements with fictional writing creates some fascinating and bizarre effects such as when the plane carrying the explorers notices the pterodactyls swarming in the distance.  They look VERY believable and even deceiving because form a distance they look like regular birds until they fly closer.  Awesome moment there, as was the first moment the bigger dinosaurs impressively and intimidatingly make their presence known.  You just know the outcome through this Congolese jungle isn't going to be a smooth ride for these brave explorers.

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the Dinosaur Project.  It's a short movie anyway at just around the 80-minute mark.  It's a new way of taking the dinosaur genre to a new level, though of course the Dinosaur Project just has to be fictional because obviously there's no dinosaurs roaming around anymore, and also I really don't think they possessed the smarts to understand human behavior like they're presented here which isn't believable because they've never seen humans before so what are the odds they'd be able to adapt and interact with them like a dog?  Not very good.

Still, to capture a short glimpse of what it might possibly be like to see dinosaurs and people sharing the same land and interacting is a joy to watch on screen even though such a thing is impossible.  Excellent film.  I'm just surprised how the dinos reveal themselves similarly to how they do in the Dino Crisis 2 video game I mention above (except in the game I don't believe the pterodactyls appeared until much later).",1435622400,,3627,5.045302013422819

This film doesnt give you a moment to be bored with the usual camera tricks that are common with found footage film due to the intense action and total fatality of the characters storylines. The movie feels like a complete misadventure that is believable. I almost forgot the this was a fictional account due to the back and forth between choppy footage and hand held camcorder style the movie uses. The dinosaurs in this film are vicious, unnatural predators that bring the nightmare home and yet there are small moments when the story shows a playful excitement of new discovery of a species thought to be extinct for millions of years. This isn't a fun carefree film like Jurassic Park  but it isn't suppose to be that kind of film. The Dinosaur Project is a pleasant surprise as far as being intense and chilling.

If you DO like this type of movie, or if it makes no difference to you, then I think you'll rather enjoy it if you give it a chance and don't turn it off after 10 minutes, as apparently some people have done. It has a good story, interesting characters (except, perhaps, for the almost stereotypical bad guy who meets his rather predictable end), and the dinosaurs look more real than the ones in Jurassic Park. OK, there's no T-Rex (fortunately I didn't know there was one on the cover when I rented this movie; so I wasn't disappointed), but those things are overrated anyway. The movie was appealingly done, and I found myself enjoying it and rooting for Luke.

For those of you who keep saying they leave you hanging about Luke's fate at the end, you are WRONG. SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ THE NEXT SENTENCE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!.....The very LAST scene before the credits roll is of Luke AND HIS NOT-DEAD FATHER as seen through the satellite phone that Luke has just finally repaired again.

The dinosaurs were exceptionally well done, but the tyrannosaurus on the box cover is nowhere in the movie unless it appeared briefly during one of the several mini-comas I fell into during the film's 83 minutes. The whole shaky-cam approach didn't help. I kept seeing South Park's Randy Marsh videoing giant guinea pigs; I swear, the plesiosaur made the exact same noise as those damned guinea pigs!
  The male members of the expedition not only run like little girls when their camp is attacked by pterosaurs at night, leaving Liz (looking almost as spectacular as the dinosaur effects) to fend for herself, they really have no reaction at all to her death in the attack.
  Besides the great effects and a very attractive blonde, the film offers two more bright moments. It depicts bipedal dinosaurs swimming, a much-discussed possibility within the paleontology community. It also set up an obvious rip-off of Jurassic Park with a frilled, spitting dinosaur, but took an interesting and unexpected turn when its dino-phlegm was revealed as marking its territory (thereby protecting the protagonist) rather than a neurotoxin as in JP.

I thought (hoped) that horrible craze would have died out by now, but no, as this latest entry proves, it hasn't.  I guess it's hard to put to rest a worn out gimmick that has definitely worn out its welcome.  What makes this copycat even worse, is the inclusion of many cameras (one is even strapped to a dinosaur!).  At one point, you have a guy filming a guy who's filming a team at work.  They also over peppered the opening sequence with a series of news reports slapped together in a half hazard fashion.  Add to this barrage a kid who loves to film himself while he talks to THE world.  He even films himself stowing away and getting caught stowing away!  Naturally, this whole mess is ""found"" footage riddled with blackouts no less.  There's nothing duller than many dark moments.
I can understand the need for a film crew to film this luckless expedition, but explain the unwanted kid who just happens to have a ton of these little cams that apparently can stick to anything and record.  That's either providence, an overblown ego desperate to film every inch of his life, or lousy/lazy scriptwriting.  The sad thing is, without the unnecessary stunt of found footage, this could have been a nice little adventure movie.
The trouble with found footage is the inherent difficulty of getting around a single viewpoint.  Hammering the film with a bunch of little cameras filming many vantage points, makes one wonder, who was editing this footage as they went traipsing through the jungle?

I would have kept this movie had it not been just another crappy found footage joke.  Instead, it just put me in a foul mood.....immediately.....making it impossible to enjoy anything after that.  (Although the few dinosaurs we glimpse are nicely done.)",1364601600,,1826,4.826366559485531

So, I guess if you're here reading this, and haven't seen the movie yet, you probably are asking yourself if it's worth seeing, or possibly is it worthy of sitting on your shelf next to Jurassic Park? The answer is ...*drum roll*.... nope.

If you where like me, and noticed the trailer showed very few scenes of dinosaurs, and mostly showed a few long shots with flying bat-o-saurs in the distance, then noticed the one close up shot for a brief second showed some lame CGI creations, then you probably did or will go into this movie with low expectations. Let me tell you now, if you already have those feelings, you won't kick yourself for defying curiosity and just skipping this movie all together.

So the plot is a team has been sent into Africa somewhere to find out if random sightings and stories about Dinosaurs roaming the jungle are true, or just a hoax. The team consists of the usual candidates... the leader explorer guy who has a million missions under his belt and expects to find nothing. The kid who wasn't supposed to go, but tags along anyway and causes the usual ""I wanted to come, but if I didn't, there would be no interest for the teenagers to possibly watch this film"", the one who says, ""We can't go there, it's forbidden and cursed blah, blah, blah, and of coarse a bunch of nobodies who get picked off one by one"".
So the helicopter this group is being flown into the jungle with is knocked out of the sky and luckily everyone survives. How convenient. Even more convenient is it crashed almost on top of their destination. A small village where natives live. But something isn't right, no ones around, but heck, don't call for help or anything, just stay the night in those huts and wait for what did it to come back. They do! That's not a spoiler tho, as you can probably guess this is not a movie where a group of explorers stay in small huts and wait to die. After some running and screaming, things settle down as the group gets deeper into the jungle, find a few puppies and feed them candy and what not... always good to make friends with a new species as you never know when they will help you out of the danger that you brought yourselves. I'm trying not to expose a spoiler, but WHO THE HECK DECIDED ONE OF THE EXPLORERS SHOULD GO NUTS AND TURN MICHAEL MYERS ON EVERYONE?

Anyway... the start was interesting, the middle was OK, the ending was awful. I don't want to reveal spoilers, but had the ending not have been what it is, it might have been somewhat decent. If they wanted to end it the way it is, then maybe they should have shown it as the Dinosaurs where not there, they where ghosts and they didn't show up on film, people there just thought they saw what they saw, that at least would be somewhat of a twist and a clever-ish ending, but instead they did what they did here, and it's a lame, cheap way to end a cheaply made movie.

I won't give the movie 0 stars; It's watchable from start to finish, the acting was not that bad, the shots where bearable, even on the handheld views, and no, it's not the CGI i'm saying makes it lame, it was the plot of this thing that creates lame characters you don't care about, and lame events that just bring the movie down more and more as it goes along until you just hate the ending that stops short with no big climax to finish it off. I think what it is that I didn't like the most was the balance of what it was doing and trying to do, but not working one bit what-so-ever. They introduce a part here, that sets up a part there, but not in a clever way, nor does it pay off. Then this happens here, and what's it got to do with the rest after that? It's like they attempted to make little connections here and there, but the pay off to see it, well, ya couldn't care less and it was a major let down if you even did tie them together.

By the way, what the heck are the flying things in this? They looked like something made up on a computer rather than something based on an actual dinosaur. What where they, giant prehistoric bats? When you go into a dinosaur movie, you at least want to see a dinosaur that is modeled on a real one don't you? Not a bunch of things that looked like a vampire transformed halfway between a bat and a Wizard of Oz flying monkey. Speaking of let downs, check out the cover of this movie. If we're seeing the same one, the one with a T-rex behind 3 of the actors of this film.... well, if you expect to see that T-Rex, boy will you be sorely disappointed. In this whole thing, I think 3 or 4 species of supposed Dinosaurs are used. However if you loved Yoshi from Super Mario Bros (movie) then you are gonna love the CGI insults of that creation, with their big kitten eyes and wagging puppy tongues. Oh how cute... no, wait, in a thriller Dinosaur movie? This isn't Barney... I expected one of the Dinosaurs in this film to grab a frying pan and whack someone over the head with it and say in Elmo's voice, ""Not da Momma"". Probably would have earned the film a 4 star rating had they done that! Least I'd know they knew they weren't making a serious film to be respected for realism.

Overall; many people will dismiss my review because they want to see it anyway, but then, when you do, you can remember this review and heed I told you so.
You will then probably kick yourself if you purchased this movie in anyway. Ain't worth seeing again, ain't a keeper either. Certainly far from the worst movie of all time, I mean, you can watch it from start to finish with only a few hesitations of thinking maybe something is better on TV right now... but a second time viewing? Nah, not without some personal reason to check out something no one else but yourself cares about.

5168377,2,B008JENBLO,The dinosaurs in this film are a cut above those in Asylum films. That said the overall quality of the film suffers from the technique used on such cult hits as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield both of which I personally found unwatchable. Rent this if you must and watch it by fast-forwarding to the dinosaurs.,1364515200,,318,4.5964912280701755

5168379,4,B008JENBLO,"I went into this movie with negative reviews in my head that I had read but decided to give it a chance.  I liked it.  It wasn't fabulous but it was entertaining and I thought the few dinosaurs we did see were terrific; not completely accurate maybe, but well done and very ""real"" looking.  I loved the baby one and would not mind seeing a sequel to show me what happened to the young dino and the boy.  I was quite surprised by the ending and liked it.  I  adore old scifi movies from the 50's forward and I am very happy to have seen this one to add to my collection of fun scifi movies. I look forward to Syfy originals (you know you do too!!!) and I think this fits in with the qualilty of some of the better offerings from that terrific channel.  Don't go into it hoping for fantastic, but do get it for fun.  I do not feel I wasted my money at all.",1364515200,2,854,4.011834319526627
5168380,2,B008JENBLO,"With the increase of sightings of the Mokele Mbembe in the Congo, a group of British adventurers and scientists take out to find them. Jonathan (Richard Dillane) is the leader of the group, while his undisciplined electronic whiz son Luke (Matt Kane) comes along as a stowaway. Natasha ""tank top"" Loring provides some early eye candy. Amara (Abena Ayivor) is their local guide who knows more than what she tells. There are others too.

On their way to the location, their helicopter is taken down, as it seems they are not designed to withstand an impact from a single pterodactyl. Once on the ground, more CG critters are encountered.

On the plus side we get to see the dinosaurs early in the film and don't have to wait until the last frame. The CG dinosaurs are a cut above the rubber head ones previously used in that Area 51 downed plane film. There are still problems with the hand held genre. Luke's at home stationary mounted camera shakes, zooms, and pans on its own. I think this would have been a better production if they were to have a limited use of this hand held genre within the film. It just doesn't work.

The acting wasn't that great as I found myself yearning for the return of Jeff Goldblum. I kept hoping a dinosaur would bite the head off Matt Kane as I grew weary of his facial close-ups and idiotic comments. The day after the crew was attack by dinosaurs, Luke uses his camera to lament about his relationship with his father. HEY LUKE! You were just attacked by dinosaurs!

Writer and director Sid Bennett squandered a great opportunity to make a quality film.

8528595,2,B008JENBLO,"The casting was acceptable and the cg acceptable too. Especially for an indie movie. One of the better indie movies in terms of production quality. But this film became stupid the moment the folks were surrounded and not one person attempted a night fire before retiring and no one had a weapon to defend themselves [I won't give away more than that]. Unrealistic. Could not watch beyond that point. I grew up hunting, fishing, backpacking, camping, as well as living on a small farm in a forested area. Slept many a nights under the stars in the wilderness. No one enters a forest without guns and survival gear including items to start a fire. Every pack has survival gear in case one or more pack gets lost or damaged. Experienced woodsmen and women know this. And no, survival gear would not be tucked away in metal cases. Such items would be readily available in case of emergency. Insulting to think we viewers wouldn't know this too. I might give it another try. But for now moving on to something else hopefully less insulting.",1530316800,,1035,4.66120218579235
8528596,2,B008JENBLO,"I had read this  is  the best Dinosaur movie since Jurassic Park. NO WAY. This is done in a pseudo documentary style. We are suppose to believe that some lost recordings of a group of dinosaur explorers was retrieved after they disappeared in the jungle. There loads of shakey camera work and long moments of black blank footage  that are a part of the recordings. I feel the producers just wanted to fill out an hour and half of time and pad their production. This technique only frustrates the viewer. I wonder how many minutes of black footage I had to endure to get to see dinosaurs. There were a few dinosaurs, mostly small ones. The dinosaur scenes are all to brief, and nowhere near as vivid as Jurassic Park or any of the sequels. There are other better dinosaur movies to be purchased. Do not expect a great view of dinosaurs, this film does not have it.",1528934400,,863,4.449367088607595

8528599,5,B008JENBLO,"Okay, so I hate flicks with so-called, through the camera, POV experiences, but I was desperate for some entertainment, so I gave it a shot. So many of these kinds of films have such poor storylines or no story at all, or worse actors who can't act. This one, however, surprised me. I actually had to leave to run an errand and when I got back, I finished it. I read a number of the reviews here and I have to say, they're too hard on this little flick. It had good acting; a storyline and believable monsters. No...it's not a blockbuster movie, but it ain't half bad for entertainment...unless you're a movie snob. I liked it. And that's from a guy who worked behind the scenes. I gave it five stars as a decent ""B"" flick, to offset all of the smarmy reviews who seem to think they're Siskel and Ebert.

8528601,2,B008JENBLO,"Did I watch all of it?  No.  I got bored and skipped ahead.  Any movie that makes me do that gets two stars.

Typical elimination by dino movie, only with hand-held cameras that are usually being held by an epileptic on a very bad day when you actually want to see something.  Saves on the costs of special effects, I guess.  It could have been at least OK, but the found footage nonsense, the actually rather boring presentation (you know what's going to happen anyhow, why wait?) and the uneven pacing just said, no.

I had more fun with another dino movie that was actually more poorly acted, with poorer production values that was so over the top, it was funny.  This didn't even have the decency to be a half-way good drinking-game movie.
