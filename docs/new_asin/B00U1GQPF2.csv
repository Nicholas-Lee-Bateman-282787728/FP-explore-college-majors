7027207,5,B00U1GQPF2,Kids love the octonauts!! :) thanks to this show my 4 year old knows more about sea animals than I do!,1436745600,6,102,3.9047619047619047
7027208,5,B00U1GQPF2,I have a 5 3/4 year old granddaughter & a 2 year old great grandson & they both LOVE Octonauts! I have all of the DVDs for them & They are entranced by them. The Octonauts not only entertain them but they teach them about the oceans & seas & all of the life in them in such a way that they learn without even knowing that they're being taught! What a great way to introduce our up & coming generations about the importance of the Earth & Seas & the importance of protecting them!,1436659200,,479,4.052631578947368
7027209,4,B00U1GQPF2,"My son who is almost 3 loves the Octonauts, so it was no surprise he enjoyed this DVD. However, our DVD came flawed. The disc freezes in between the episode and Creature Repprt portion so you have to press fast forward at this point in every espisode. Not being able to let the disc play through is why I took away a star. Since none of the other reviewers mentioned this problem I'm assuming it wasn't a widespread issue.",1436659200,,422,4.3544303797468356

7027211,5,B00U1GQPF2,My grandson loved this DVD.  He's watches it frequently.  He plays with the octonauts toys imitating the DVD.,1433203200,,109,5.0
7027212,5,B00U1GQPF2,"I will say it again, NCircle has done it again with the Octonauts!! Our entire family enjoy watching the Octonauts and this movie did not fail. I love that it is educationally based and that you are constantly learning new facts and new information about a new sea creature every episode. I like that at the end you always see real life pictures of the animals you are learning about. The songs are fun and catchy and the characters are well diverse with unique traits individually. The crocodile's were my daughters favorite due to the fact that she has recently started learning about them in school. I think NSider does a wonderful job mixing learning with fun and this gets an A+ rating in my book!",1432598400,,702,4.579365079365079
7027213,5,B00U1GQPF2,"The Octonauts have done it again! My kids and I enjoy this show so much. You get adventure, laughs and lots of learning packed into short episodes that hold their attention and leave them wanting more! This show never has a dull moment, and even as a parent I usually walk away with new knowledge about a sea creature that I may or may not have even heard of before. :) This is such a cute show that disguises learning in a very fun package. My kids get so excited every time we receive a new Octonauts release. If you're searching for an entertaining show to watch with your kids, look no farther!

*Disclaimer: My family received this DVD from NCircle for the purpose of giving a review. The above is my honest opinion regarding this release.",1432080000,,744,4.430656934306569
7027214,5,B00U1GQPF2,My son is almost 4 and still loves the Octonauts  and this dvd has been one of his favorites so far! The adventures they go on are so cute and small kids can easily follow along  the storyline and understand. I would recommend any of the Octonauts dvds for any child that enjoys sea life animals and action packed exploring missions!,1432080000,,333,4.442622950819672

8703823,3,B00U1GQPF2,We love the octonauts! This is a great DVD my reason for 3 stars is too many advertisements in the beginning that you can't fast forward through plus it doesn't start up on its own you have to push play at the menu after all the advertisements for other movies. When playing in the car DVD player that makes it hard for the driver to do with kids buckled in. Not such a big deal when home on TV.,1450137600,,395,4.012658227848101
