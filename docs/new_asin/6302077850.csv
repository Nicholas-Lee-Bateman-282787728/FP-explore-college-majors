422154,4,6302077850,"Debbie Reynolds was so cute in this film.  If you don't know the plot it's about three girls that audition for the same leading part.  Three men involved with the show each favor a different girl. Of course Gower picks Marge Champion.  Bob Fosse plays a young stage hand? (not sure what his job title is) and wants Debbie, who he seems to like, to get the part. I never saw Bob Fosse in a role like this before. Stanley Donnen had a difficult time with the dancers in this film.  Bob Fosse went along with him, but the Champions didn't.  The Champions ended up doing their own choreorgraphy, and Bob did the numbers that he was in.",1178150400,4,631,4.313559322033898
422155,5,6302077850,"i think this film, Give a Girl a Break,"" is very good, and the choreography alone in it, makes it well worth watching.  Debbie Reynolds does some lovely dance numbers.  Also Marge and Gower Champion really shine in this film and in my opinion do some of their best dance numbers in it.  It doesn't have the most interesting plot, bt is worth it for the song and dance.  I think any fan of 50's musicals would enjoy it.  It's colorful and a fun film to watch.  I have to nore, the costumes are first rate, some of the lovliest I've seen in musicals.",1031011200,39,548,4.221153846153846
422239,5,6302077850,"""Give A Girl A Break"" offers an insightful experience in the early work of Debbie Reynolds, and the major break-through contribution of Helen Wood. However here more importantly is work by Ira Gershwin, Marge and Gower Champion, Stanley Donen, and the early film-work of Bob Fosse. You need this film if you are striving for a career as a writer in musical theatre.  Myself a gypsy-writer and sometime-actor now retired from my day-jobs and with my Master's work in Playwriting done. However, my degree-program did not include musical theatre. It's had to be self-education. And herein enters this film. With every stage performance in Straight-plays, American Musical Theatre, Gilbert-and-Sullivan, Ballet, Opera, and the eras of Modern Dance, that I can manage, there were still voids and this movie offers one essential to be filled. You also must read ""Fosse"" by Sam Wasson and ""All His Jazz"" by Martin Gottfried, both of which also offer deep insights into the making of musical theatre and films.  Also ""The Fosse Style"" by Debra McWaters, foreword by Ben Vereen, and the works of Richard Kislan, including ""Hoofing on Broadway"", which includes a chapter on Marge and Gower Champion. Cheers! I hope I've offered something valuable to you. If you're piloting your own career through these waters, I recommend this movie, ""Give A Girl A Break"" to you.",1395014400,2,1355,5.071748878923767
422240,5,6302077850,"A gentle fun musical starring Debbie Reynolds, eclipsed by her better known films Singing In The Rain, I love Melvin and The Unsinkable Molly Brown, this is nevertheless a nice little film. It has prominent roles for the exceptional dancing team of Marge and Gower Champion. If you are fans of these stars(I am) it is well worth a watch.",1391904000,,337,4.633333333333334

422244,4,6302077850,"This is not one of the greatest film musicals of all time, but how can one go wrong with such a panoply of dance stars:  Marge and Gower Champion, Bob Fosse (who would become a Broadway legend), and Debbie Reynolds at her perkiest and cutest.  It was genuine, and comes across that way.  She parodied herself on Will&Grace decades later, but this was the real McCoy.

The Warner Archive collection of nearly-forgotten films are treasures:  lovingly produced with beautiful, commercial-quality, picture and sound.  Wide-screen.

Definitely worth a look, if you are a dance or musical fan.",1338940800,4,587,5.052083333333333
422245,4,6302077850,"This is a great dancing musical.
My only complaint to Warner Brothers, is that it would have benefited from a better digital transfer.
The colours are muddy, and there are a few blemishes that were inherent on the Technicolor positive.",1311379200,2,235,4.9
422246,5,6302077850,This little MGM musical dropped off the radar and has been missing for years. Thankfully it is now available and to MGM musical fans a 'must have'.,1272067200,,147,4.481481481481482
422247,5,6302077850,"GIVE A GIRL A BREAK is one of the best MGM musicals, and should be among the 10 best list of Hollywood musicals, and not in the last place. Imagine: Gower Champion, Bob Fosse and Stanley Donen together, plus charming Debbie Reynolds and brassy Marge Champion. I suggest the number four of MUSICALS OF THE DREAM FACTORY with GIVE A GIRL A BREAK, INVITATION TO THE DANCE (Gene Kelly directing and dancing), YOLANDA AND THE THIEF (Astaire and Minnelli, what else?), LOVELY TO LOOK AT (Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, the Champions), I LOVE MELVIN (Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor and a terrific score) and perhaps SMALL TOWN GIRL because there were Ann Miller and Bobby Van. You can't miss that, for sure!",1252627200,2,713,4.804878048780488

7820902,5,6302077850,"Ok folks, this is a cute Debbie Reynolds movie. About a young actress and dancer trying to make it in show business. Debbie Reynolds is adorable and the dance routines are amazing! Especially when Bob Fosse is actually in them! Fosse is truly one of the BEST dancers and choreographers of all time! I think every hair on him has its own set of muscles that move just glide and move with every music note. If you're a dancer, you'll love this movie. If you enjoy dance musicals, you'll love this movie. This isn't the typical Astaire and Rogers or Gene Kelly style of dance....but was revolutionary and inventive for the times.

 I never realized how cute Fosse was! I'm familiar with his works, but now I have his actual face to go with his name! I've even spotted him in a few movies, but couldn't find him in the credits....occasionally he's listed in the credits of a few movies with the other extra dancers. Or I spot him with the dancers, but he's listed as choreographer. I think he was pure genius! I enjoy this movie. It's happy, upbeat, no violence or technology. Just pure entertainment!",1457222400,,1097,4.563451776649746

7820904,3,6302077850,"The movie is pretty good, but not enough singing and dancing for me especially not enough by Debbie Reynolds.  Not worth the $8.99 I paid to view it and buy it.  They must have made it in one week.  Bob Fosse is really the main dancer in this which saves the film.",1438905600,,264,4.038461538461538
7820905,4,6302077850,"Although its not a classic like Singing in the Rain or others, still this has an excellent cast, fun songs and comedy, and excellent dancing. The best parts are they way they film the dancing, and those half dream, half imagined musical sequences MGM could create! Even better, this is the first on-screen appearance of Bob Fosse, who only a year later is to become an acclaimed choreographer on Broadway in The Pajama Game. Although its not his choreography here, it is fun to see him dance. Watch 'Kiss Me Kate' for a short duet he does with Carol Haney for his first on-screen choreography.",1431993600,,593,4.6571428571428575

7820907,3,6302077850,"After just reading Debbie Reynolds' new memoir (2014), called UNSINKABLE, I became interested in revisiting some of her old films.  She gave interesting little bits of information about her co-stars in various films.  This was one of her very earliest, and while it wasn't great, maybe, by today's standards, it was entertaining to see her singing and dancing at such a young age.  You could see her star power blossoming even then. A bit of Hollywood fluff, you might say; but if you love the old films, as I do, you will be happy to see this one.  The extra special draw for me, and the real reason that I purchased this DVD, is that her co-star and love interest here is a very young Bob Fosse, one of my idols for his choreography & contributions to the modern jazz dance world.  He was SO young here, but danced up a storm.  Again, it was fame in the making.  The main dance stars billed in the film were Marge and Gower Champion, but I only had eyes for Fosse.",1404864000,,966,4.363128491620111
