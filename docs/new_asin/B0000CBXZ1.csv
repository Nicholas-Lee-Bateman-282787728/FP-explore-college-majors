1918207,5,B0000CBXZ1,"This movie was absolutely wonderful. I was a bit taken aback at first because I thought it was a western but it opens in modern day NY with Edge one of our protaganists robbing an old lady's home. Once over my shock I settled down and watched one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was the most original, intelligent movies. An amazing, masterful piece of art. This is not however some arthouse drivel but an exciting and moving film that will appeal to anyone who has a love of cinema and a good story. I highly recommend it!",1082937600,4,531,4.267326732673268
1918208,4,B0000CBXZ1,"How to begin.... I purchased this movie looking to find other films starring David Wenham (besides LOTR) and was truly blown away.  The style of the film was quite unexpected and the way the story unfolds was completely original. (I don't want to give antyhing away!)  This movie is difficult to categorize - it's not your typical western, not your typical family drama, not a typical anything.  The acting is superb, especially David Wenham.  While there isn't a huge amount of dialogue in his scenes, he is able to convey such a range of emotions with is face and body language that he doesn't have to say anything.  The relationships in the film are gritty and real and the violence, while significant, doesn't seem overdone - it's appropriate for the tone of the movie and the life the characters lead.  The cinematography is breathtaking - Manchevski's story and directing are gritty and beautiful at once and David Wenham is raw, harsh, ruthless and, of course, stunning!",1074038400,7,977,4.855421686746988
1918209,5,B0000CBXZ1,"Dust is a dynamic mixture of love & hate, attack & defense, power & helplessness, reality & fantasy, lust & rejection, expectations & cruel reality, belief & skepticism, boiled all together in a furnace up in the Macedonian highlands, powered by unimaginable greed for gold and power. It is an adventure which will take you back in time, when people could loose everything in a split second, and then back in present, just enough to help you re-evaluate what you have just seen with today's sense and criteria... Real artistic refreshment from the all-present commercial & worthless Hollywood plastic. Five thumbs up for this excellent movie from Milcho Manchevski!",1071100800,12,665,5.110091743119266
1918210,1,B0000CBXZ1,"Wow, did this miss the mark. You can get the basic storyline for this film from the Amazon review. Sounds intriguing, right? Well, the filmmaker desperately wanted to make a different kind of movie, and the desperation shows. This film tries so damn hard to be full of ""interesting characters"" that everything comes off like a student film. This is most obvious in the flashback storyteller, an old woman named Angela, who we are supposed to think of as cool and vaguely hip because she can talk trash with the black kid that breaks into her house. Good Christ, this was a bad movie. Obvious and superficial. The director's so-called ""homage"" to various film genres are just simply poor rip offs. Sort of like the rappers talking tonelessly over former hits. I guess if you have no talent, an ""homage"" is as close as you're going to come.",1069632000,7,838,4.668918918918919

1918219,5,B0000CBXZ1,"If I say my favorite character in The Lord of the Rings is Faramir, the answer I receive isn't ""Oh! I love him, too!""  Or ""I can't believe they changed him from the book!"" No it's usually, ""Who?""  If Faramir is so under appreciated, what does that say for his actor? Beloved Australian actor David Wenham is so little known in the US, I've had to search long and hard online for Region 1 DVDs then wait weeks for them to arrive.

Such was the case with Dust. The 2001 western also starring Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love) was only $6 on Overstock. Cheap and I've always loved westerns! Besides, it looked good-and more importantly-was a Region 1 release. Three weeks later, when at last the DVD was out of the mailer and into my laptop, my first shock was that it wasn't a tale of the Australian west. This is the American west, yet it takes place is contemporary New York City. Stay with me!

We open with Edge (Adrian Lester) a down on his luck hood who's breaking into someone's apartment. The crone inside (Rosemary Murphy) however is much more than Edge bargained for. The feisty old woman holds Edge at gunpoint and tells him a story. If Edge wants her wealth and hidden gold-he is going to listen to Angela's tale of the old west. When cowboy brothers Luke (David Wenham) and Elijah (Joseph Fiennes) both fall for Lilith (Anne Brochet) trouble brews. Seeking thrill and adventure, Luke travels to Turkey and becomes a mercenary in the Ottoman War-ever trying to escape gospel sprouting Elijah.

Both storylines presented by director Milcho Manchevski (Before The Rain) seem simple and overplayed at face value. Young black guy and white old woman bond over feuding cowboy brother love story. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Strange it is, though, that these two types of stories are together in one film. The flashbacks, humor, and characters break the time and place divides between them, and the action moves seamlessly between events. It seems almost absurd to start, but once belief is suspended, you become invested in the characters. You simply must see how these stories conclude.

Naturally you can't go along with people you don't like. David Wenham's Luke is the main character of the film, yet his dialogue is next to nothing. Strangely Joseph Fiennes is billed first even though he's only a handful of critical scenes. In most cases, Crone's narration speaks for them both. Occasionally annoying as narrators are, Angela's voiceover here makes her own storyline better-and it saves us from Wenham's odd American accent. He tries, but it's somehow off; a mix between Southern, Texan, and set back one hundred years. Wenham, however, excels in facial expressions, and his non-vocal performance speaks more than most. Not just in looks and glares, but physically Wenham takes on the rough cowboy bumps and bruises and pains. You look at Luke and just know that had to hurt. Wenham's heart and soul is onscreen, and regardless of what you've seen him in previously he is Luke here.

Pleasantly surprising in Dust is Adrian Lester (Hustle) as Edge. He excels beyond his witty dialogue and sarcastic remarks. I must admit I know nothing of him, but his banter with `Crone'-the nickname he gives Angela, the physical action and pain, he's a great tough guy mixed with despair. It's not tough to see how the parallels between Edge and Luke come about. Both characters end up different from where they started. The relationships between Luke and Lilith and Edge and Angela do not take the traditional road. It's odd that Dust was hyped as a western romance on the cover when in fact very little romance or Old West action takes place. Am I complaining? No.

One sore spot in Dust is Joseph Fiennes. His work prior in Shakespeare in Love and Enemy at the Gates has not impressed me, nor has he here. Where his real life brother Ralph Fiennes takes on varied roles and genres (The English Patient, Red Dragon, Harry Potter), Joseph seems to play the same one dimensional character over and over. Elijah is supposed to be a God fearing wronged husband with a vendetta against his brother, but we don't see that in what little we see of him. With a different angle on the script from Manchveski, Dust could very well be Elijah's movie. As it stands, Elijah is the very definition of a supporting character-merely reacting to Luke's courses of action.

On the other hand, Dust's small supporting cast does a fine job; The crooked cops chasing Edge, the Ottoman mercenaries and army leaders on both sides. They look the part. Anne Brochet is pretty run of the mill as Lilith, but Nikolina Kujaca's portrayal of the pregnant guerilla wife Neda is beautiful, exotic, graceful, and poised.

Dust brings to light an obscure part of history for me. Truly, had I known the movie was more about the Ottoman wars, I might not have tuned in. The Old West scenes are standard and brief enough, but they serve their purpose. Where Dust really sells itself is in the contemporary New York abode of Edge and Angela. It's odd to say, but the New York City captured in Dust no longer exists-the pre September 11th city. Today we like to paint New York as a new and rebuilt, revitalizing the American Way! Dust, however, captures what many New Jersey folk like myself thought of New York pre 9/11; Dirty, dark, heinous violence and crime. Edge is every bit a child of his society, as Angela is hers. We want to see her pass the torch to him before it is too late. We want Edge-the violent offender in the film's opening scene-to make it. The storylines come through and circle together. I suspect it's where the title comes from; ashes to ashes, dust to dust. And hey, while I'm on a sappy note, Dust does offer a few handsome shots of the World Trade Center.

Dust's European scenes were filmed on location, and Manchveski succeeds in setting up his exotic locales and foreign conflicts. The action is unfortunately a bit confusing sometimes. When we first meet our friends and foes in Turkey, it's tough to tell who is who. Perhaps a few characterizations are not politically correct today, but it's a movie dramatizing a specific time, and Edge's commentary on the past events keeps things light hearted. Manchveski's interview and behind the scenes features on the DVD also shed light on the story, characters, and locales; Seeing his thoughts and philosophies add to this unusual tale. Unfortunately, there's not much else to supplement the DVD, but with a film such as Dust-where performance and story are more important than action-there isn't much to add. Dust speaks for itself-no extras needed.

I've seen far more avant-garde films, but fans of the offbeat, period piece, or artsy film should pick up Dust at the first chance you can get. The violence and sexual situations are not meant for children, and guys looking for chicks won't find them here. David Wenham fans have no doubt already discovered this movie, but for American audiences looking for a film with substance, Dust is a must see.",1229299200,4,6989,4.757425742574258
1918220,2,B0000CBXZ1,"Dust is NOT your typical western.  It is impractical that a dying, elderly woman would befriend her apartment trashing/thieving thug, especially after he coldcocks her.  Equally as rediculous is that this same thug would have genuine feelings for her at her dying bedside, a day after placing a gun to her head making demands....just stupid!

This movie can be gorey also (ex: shooting and slitting the throats of sheep/goats, disembowelment, decapitation, etc.)

Not sure I understand the positive reviews but that's just me.

Not recommended.",1196035200,3,544,5.352941176470588
1918224,5,B0000CBXZ1,"Thought as many probably did, that Dust was a sleeper of a Western Outlaw kind of film.  Dust is not that, it is so much more!  Dust starts out in modern day NYC where a young man breaks into an apartment, looking for something.  As he ransacks the place, something from the past is soon discovered.  The film bounces back and forth from the present day to a day nearly 100 years earlier in which two brothers fought their way over dangerous ground.  The scenes depicting the Turkish soldiers are gritty and bloody, and as the film rolls along it does not get deep with mystery, but strong with storytelling.  I do not want to give away any more than that, but I will say this one really surprised me.",1188086400,,701,4.3538461538461535
1918225,4,B0000CBXZ1,"I picked this up because I recognized the stars and because, according to the dust jacket, the director had done some worthy work in the past.

I didn't mind jumping from here to there with only a gossamer thread to cling to. I'm not generally opposed to body count. I thought the suckling sucking tobacco was gratuitous, but that's me. I guess the point there was: 'this ain't Kansas', morals and values were completely different.

One thing this movie taught me: watch the 'extras' first, a thing I have mostly avoided. The director's explanation of his intent made the movie make sense.

I will buy this movie, what's more I will buy another to give as a gift.",1125273600,4,663,4.601694915254237
1918226,5,B0000CBXZ1,"OK, obviously some of the people writing the reviews here don't know a thing about the history of the Balkan region, and most of them don't care, so they condemn the movie as a bad, bloody or nuisance, but in fact, this people have no clue what they are talking about.

I can say this movie is full of emotions, full of realistic facts and real scenes... As far as I can see some people asked where is the movie happening?!? I mean, c'mon...  if you give this movie a chance to take you places, you should know where it's taking you: The great little country Macedonia. And if you want to see a part of Macedonian history from the turn of the century, well this is it, and it's as real as it gets, although there are things even more horrible than what is shown in this movie that the Ottoman Empire soldiers were doing to the people. So enjoy the agony (as some people called the horrific scenes) and learn from the history...

I would say you need to watch this movie not with a bag of popcorn in your lap, nor with a bunch of buddies around trying to make themselves interesting, you need to see this movie with an open mind.",1116806400,8,1128,4.2372093023255815
1918227,4,B0000CBXZ1,"Finding and trying out DUST from my local Blockbuster was like finding a piece of gold.  If you like classic style spagetti westerns in the same vein as Clint Eastwood and Sergei Leone - then this one's for you.

I don't know who this Polish-sounding-like named director is, but he and his film crew managed to make one hellava one-of-a-kind western.

And it shows from the get-go.  Starting out in modern-day New York, DUST is a tale that unfolds with twists and turns that will keep you watching on, wondering where this is all leading, and how this strange old woman has possession of old artifacts, from an old pistol to gold coins.

And how does she know about the life and tale of who they belonged to?  An American cowboy gunslinger who left America, traveling to foreign shores and making history out of his destiny.

The look and feel of the film is phenomenal, gritty and lovely in a myriad of ways.  The overall details was not lost in the making, thus pointing out to me the director's awesome vision for this film.

Sure there were a few things that could have been better, but still in all, DUST was truly unique, and well worth a look at.  Somewhat unforgettable in some ways.",1105747200,7,1191,4.5233644859813085
1918228,2,B0000CBXZ1,"From what I see so far, my thumbs down for this movie is definitely a minority opinion, so do scroll up and down to read those who gave it 5 stars.

I said fantastic premise, and it is true, DUST has a premise that is fantastic. This is a beautifully photographed movie, melting from black-and-white into color then back into black-and-white, jumping back and forth between fetchingly photographed contemporary New York and back in time, somewhere in the Ottoman Empire ca. early 1900s -- well, I said ""somewhere"" but that's because the movie does not make it clear exactly, where, it could have been Bulgaria, Greece, or Albania, but from other reviews I read that it's supposed to be Macedonia, so it contains a touch of the fantastic (time travel, destiny, dizzying coincidences, iconic symbology, etc.), which would've made it my cup of tea, alas it's such a hodgepodge of a hard-to-follow plot that it left me frustrated in the end. I know that if I watch it a second time I'll pick up on the many nuances that I've missed, on the other hand, it's so terribly cruel and bloody that I can't put myself through such an agony again. The film is littered with shots of (a few among many nauseating takes)of sheep, that was halfway shorn, with its pelt dangling, being shot and tossed around, a child who pauses suckling on mom's breast to smoke a cigarette, a surrealistic mishmash of people shooting at each other, you really don't know who's the enemy, who's the good guy or the bad guy (though it's hinted that the Ottomanis are the baddies) and you simply get tired trying to understand the plot, and the mind of the director who strung this whole thing up.

That said, yes it's the story of two brothers who feud over a woman in the Wild West, then the loser takes off for the Ottoman lands in order to earn gold for killing people, his other brother follows him and lordy! FINDS him in the middle of a butcher-style battle, and while none of the twists/turns/motivations make sense, the last minute bond depicted between the 90-year old elderly woman (revealed to be the little girl born in the middle of a battle field while everyone around her was getting killed by everyone) and the black man who has entered her apartment to steal her money to pay off the corrupt NYPD cops who're threatening him with shooting off his kneecaps, is quite touching (even believable).

Pheeewwww! I am breathless just trying to tell this tale and keep up its pace.... Nevertheless, there is a sensitive twist to the story (the friendship between the old lady and her would-be mugger), as well as the above mentioned beautiful photography. So if you don't mind blood, gore, and a convoluted plot, go ahead and rent it.",1105660800,7,2709,4.651356993736952
1918229,4,B0000CBXZ1,"DUST is your typical western set in rebellious, turn-of-the-last-century Macedonia, with the two western heroes portrayed by a British and an Australian actor; equally typical is the interwoven story of a modern day burglar falling in love with his nonagenarian victim while occasionally tearing her apartment apart in a search for hidden gold.  Okay, maybe ""love"" is too strong a word.  Let's call it a sympathetic bond.

  As a story about storytelling DUST is much more successful than it is as either a period western or a modern crime thriller.  I enjoyed its quirky, skitterish ways (with emphasis on the word ""quirky."")  Fans of spaghetti westerns should get a kick out of the over-the-top, exploding blood pellet fight scenes, with Turkish Nationals replacing Federales as the army that couldn't shoot straight.",1099785600,16,819,5.206106870229007

It involved so many different layers of emotion.  Especially the brutality and realism the accompanied the scenes in Macedonia and even New York.  Violence hurts, something that Hollywood likes to gloss over in most movies.  When you get shot it hurts, you bleed and death is painful and full of not very pretty shakes, rattles, defecation and screams. Overall this movie was about re-establishing a connection to your own humanity.  You will either love or hate this movie.

1918231,1,B0000CBXZ1,"Not since the pretentious art house flicks of the 1960's have I seen such schlock parading itself as great art. Art is art. This is far from it. This film stretches credulity to the breaking point. A petty crook breaks into an elderly woman's apartment, she gets him at gunpoint, and (insanely) insists that he listen to her story about 2 brothers in Macedonia. Please. He keeps coming back for more of the story because he's trying to find out where she has hidden her money, but eventually he wants to hear more of the story. Why? The characterizations are extremely thin, and the director is so in love with jumpcuts and presenting a thickly textured background for the story that the story is lost. The ONLY reason I watched this through to the end was because I had paid for it, not because the story was at all involving. Even the Making Of documentary that comes on the DVD is skimpy.

7998816,3,B0000CBXZ1,"What seems like a confused mess is actually a Balkan fable, in classic mythic style, mixing warrior-bandit heroics against the Turk with spaghetti-Western overtones and a US urban crime subplot.  Milcho Manchevski has specialized in this sort of thing, synthesizing Macedonian folkways with modern visions.  Since these are the kinds of American films most familiar to East European moviegoers, it seems natural to mix their motifs with traditional folklore.  The period recreation and details of early 20th century Macedonia are spot on (that of the American West less so).  The battle scenes are realistically grisly even if unbelievable (the cowboy American conquers, it seems, a regiment of Turks with a minimum of reloading.)

I just think it would have worked better played straight: an American outlaw who finds himself - in all ways - in the middle of the Macedonian uprising of ca. 1908.  As this is a period and locale of European history largely ignored by the screen it deserved a better treatment.  The old immigrant lady who spins the yarns of her youth to an adopted ""grandson"" completes the cycle of epic myth, as well as making the film more marketable to a US audience having little patience with subjects outside its cultural blinkers.
