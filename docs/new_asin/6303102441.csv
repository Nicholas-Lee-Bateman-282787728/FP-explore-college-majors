563644,4,6303102441,"French officer Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) marries an American officer  Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) - he actually has to marry her three times -  only to find that he has nowhere to spend his wedding night. To make  matters worse, the only way he can travel with her to the US is as a war  bride. The movie alternates between the subplot of Grant trying to find a  place to sleep and trying to get on his wife's ship to the US as her Male  War Bride.
The movie is not as funny as some of the other Grant films  (i.e. ""Operation Petticoat"" or ""Arsenic and Old Lace""), but that is  partially due to the fact that he makes such outstanding movies that just  Good appears inferior. Grant carries this film from beginning to end, but  it would have been better if he had more support. However, there is no  question that it is still worth watching. Plan to laugh out loud some and  smile a lot.
The transfer to video is not as good as it could be. The  scenes appear faded and sometimes the words are indistinct. The colonized  version may improve the picture quality.",968025600,2,1065,4.340101522842639
563645,5,6303102441,"Ann Sheridan is a perfect match for Cary Grant in this romantic comedy that involves a French army officer (Grant) and an American WAC (Sheridan)  who share a mission in post-WWII Germany. Their relationship moves from  mutual antagonism to love.  The situation becomes complicated when they  decide to marry & return to the US with Grant as the war bride.
Two  aspects of the movie, made in 1949, stand out - Grant, as a French army  officer who speaks not a word of French, and the on-location filming which  adds tremendously to the overall impression of the film.  It is very  similar in this respect to Roman Holiday made four years later with Audrey  Hepburn and Gregory Peck . A studio-bound version would have possibly  turned this from a classic comedy to a forgettable farce.
Highly  recommended. One of my all-time top 10.",966124800,6,833,4.748251748251748

563818,5,6303102441,Great movie with Cary Grant of what happens when something different changes the norm. What makes it funny is when Grant tries to follow his bride who happens to be an Army Officer who is ordered back to the USA from post war Europe and he happens to be a recent discharged French Officer.  When all the war brides are on their way to their GI husbands and he happens to be the only male bride in a system not setup for such a person.  This movie still holds up after all these years and kind of shows the aftermath of a world war in Europe.,1485561600,,541,4.09433962264151

As luck would have it, my sister and I were both sick and home from school the week that I Was a Male War Bride was playing on the Million Dollar Movie.

We must have seen that film a dozen times during that week and didn't get tired of it. We were both delighted when it came out on DVD. It is a classic. Cary Grant and Anne Sheridan have great chemistry together - two smart, pretty people - and the film is just wonderful.",1414627200,,575,4.0

564503,4,6303102441,"It is hard to go wrong with Cary Grant movies, and when he is starring in a screwball comedy, well, then it is almost impossible.

This movie is an early entry in the gender-bender genre of comedy. While it doesn't have much in the way of cross-dressing, a'la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Some-Like-It-Hot/dp/B004TJ1H1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Some Like It Hot</a>, it does have a very interesting take on the gender roles issue.

See, Cary's character is a French national, and he ends up marrying a female United States soldier, and she wants to bring him back with her to the states. Enter the comedy. The United States military and government DO have rules and laws in place to provide for married spouses of overseas soldiers to sponsor their spouses back to the United States -- however, those rules and laws were written from the point of view of a MALE soldier marrying a FEMALE foreign national, and all of the language in the rules and laws is from that point of view, but the law itself is gender neutral.

So, we get to watch Cary and his bride fight door to door, and clerk to clerk, trying to get him home with her via U.S. military resources. The results are quite amusing in a typical Cary Grant, long-suffering, sort of way.

Watch it, you will enjoy it :)

564904,5,6303102441,"I Was A Male War Bride pairs the talented Ann Sheridan and always effective Carey Grant in a comedy whose freshness is able to transcend the now seventy year old subject matter that its situation is based on.  The comedy involves an unlikely pair who are thrown together on an assignment, stemming from the exigencies of war, become romantically involved, and unexpectedly must
cope with the red tape and regulations of bureaucracy of wartime when they decide to get married.  That's the plot, but the fun begins when the American officer learns that a foreigner can only return as their spouse if they are a ""war bride"".  Naturally most of the war brides are women, so one odd circumstance follows another as Carey Grant's character, a French officer, becomes, of
necessity, designated as a ""war bride"".  While the plot is steeped in a World War Il background, the situation comedy that ensues
should delight any viewer today.  Carey Grant and Ann Sheridan make a great complimentary duo in the situation driven comedy
with Sheridan playing straight to Carey's complicated string of misfortunes.  A light, but very diverting, comedy outing.",1368748800,,1141,5.01058201058201

While my husband was stationed at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), in Belgium in 1980, Mr. Rochard was teaching a class for the branch of the University of Maryland on base. Mr. Rochard told the class they had made this movie based on his story and, since my husband expressed interest, he gave my husband a copy. I'm very sorry to say that it was lost in one of our many moves.

When I saw this film for the first time I was much younger and laughed myself silly over scenes with the wig. Having watched it again after all this time I can't really say, already knowing the movie so well, whether I would find it that funny viewing it for the first time now, but I must say that the novella was even funnier than the film (and didn't require the wearing of a wig).

Cary Grant was one of my favorite comedic actors and this was one of my favorite films along with Bringing up Baby and Arsenic and Old Lace. They're rather silly, breezy little films that make me smile. Hope you try it, and enjoy!",1357171200,,1107,4.342995169082125

Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) and U.S. Lt. Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) they decide the only thing the can do is get married. All this would be fine except for one thing. The U.S. government forms for bringing a spouse back to the U.S. assumes the spouse is female (hence bride.) After several attempts to correct this oversight it is apparent the there is only one way to get on board the ship. A horse is missing a tail and a lanky spouse is having problems with high heals. Will this work or is it just the beginning?

There are many great one-liners. Also misinterpretations and some slapstick moments. Through all of this you get the Grant expressions. The film itself was made in 1949 in several locations in Wrttemberg, Germany.

It was likely filmed in post world war II Europe as there is a lot of destruction in the background, but the movie doesn't specifically address the sadness of the era, just the post war government red tape that plagues anything involving moving between countries.

565180,4,6303102441,"I was a Male War Bride(released Aug/49),starring Cary Grant and Ann Sheridan,is set against the back drop of a post war Europe,specifically Germany,when it was divided into zones and run by the allies. The starkness and devastation of the countryside and people is quite evident all through the picture. With this as a bleak backdrop,the comedy doesn't flow as naturally as it otherwise would have. But there is no denying Grants ability in the comedy department as Hawks gives him every opportunity to shine,whether he is fighting with his extremities laying on a chair or in a tub or dressing in drag. One particular gag that stands out is a page taken right out of the Laurel and Hardy play book. Instead of Oliver Hardy this time it is Grant. It is later in the day and they both are exhausted from a long ride and lost. There is a signpost but Grant cannot read it and Sheridan tells him to go over and look. He does but still cannot make it out. Sheridan says:""Well,climb up and see"".Grant does but still can't tell what it says as it is in German. Sheridan finally turns around and catches what it says and starts to snicker. Grant slips back down the signpost and realizes,because of the nice white streak down his front,it must have said wet paint. This gag was originally done on film in the 20s then reprised in the 40s by The Boys. Grant would many times slip into a Stan Laurel or Oliver Hardy-ish mode in his films,and I have often wondered whether Grant and the Boys ever met and talked,because there is a definite influence there.
The plot involves Sheridan who is a lieutenant in the American WACS and Grant is,of all things,a Captain in the French army. If you can wrap your head around Grant,with his accent,being French,you know you will like the film. And in typical Grant style,he pulls it off,but for the life of me don't ask me how. It's a Grant ""thing"",I guess. The two characters have obviously worked together before and Grant is sent on a mission to a town in Germany. Who is ordered to accompany him but Sheridan. In fact Sheridan is Grant's driver,on a motorcycle yet;regulations you understand! Eventually,through alot of frustrations and faux pauxs,like that painted sign post,the two somehow fall in love and marry. But as things are atypical in this plot,Grant becomes a war bride to Sheridan,who is being sent home to the States for discharge. And of course the American chain of command just can't wrap their collective heads around Grant being,well,a guy. There are alot of trips and turns as a result,but in the end it is all good. Watch for ""Red"",a seaman aboard the ship,played by Ken Tobey. When Hawks went on to make his Sci-Fi classic in a few short years,The Thing from Another World,he remembered Tobey and put him in the lead.
Extras include some special footage of Army personnel visiting the set during its making,with no sound and the trailer. The picture is clean and clear.
All in all a good film. When the comedy comes it is good but it is off and on throughout,as the stark background of a war torn Germany really acts as a damper on things. But Sheridan and Grant are a good team on screen and they seemed to be having fun. 3 1/2 -4 stars.",1334880000,,3193,4.593695271453591

Humor was off as was some of the pacing in the story and some blame female lead Ann Sheridan for that one. Probably unfair as the movie just had a number of issues.

Directed by Howard Hawks

Howard Hawks directed this classic farce about how love attempts to triumph over military red tape after the close of World War II. Capt. Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) is a French officer who is assigned to put a stop to a black market operation in occupied Germany with the help of Lt. Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan), an American WAC. While their initial meetings are hardly harmonious, in time Rochard and Gates find that opposites really do attract, and they fall in love.

The two decide to get married, which seems simple enough, but the moment Gates receives orders to return to the United States and Rochard wants to join her, they soon discover just how complicated the U.S. Army can make things. While the Army has a strict protocol for dealing with ""war brides,"" there is no similar routine for men who marry female Army personnel, so in order to follow his new wife into the States, Rochard has to disguise himself as a WAC. From this moment on, nearly everything that happens to Rochard is an affront to his dignity and/or his patience, from his inability to share a bunk with his new bride to his discovery that Army regulations prevent him from driving a motorcycle (Gates has to take the handlebars, while her husband is forced to ride in a sidecar).

Wonderful Direction, Wonderful Cast and Super Screenplay!

The chemistry between Grant and Sheridan is priceless, one laugh after another.

565186,1,6303102441,"Although it's not initially obvious, there's a history between Cary Grant (as French officer Henri Rochard) and Ann Sheridan (as Lieutenant Catherine Gates), and it's all bad.  They've been on missions before and they've all ended poorly.  Frenchman Henri wants nothing to do with ""that American"" woman and the feeling is mutual.  So, to prove their dislike, they bicker, and snipe, and shout at one another, endlessly, viciously.  They carry this verbal abuse through most of the movie; it's clear they hate one another, they even say so.  Now here comes the confusing part, this movie is billed as a romantic comedy.  But.  I kept waiting for the romance and the humor to kick in, where was it?  Instead, this tedious couple keeps up a steady flow of putdowns as they try their level best to humiliate and one-up one another.  Before this story of disharmony creaked to an end (that I figured would result in the murder of one or the other), snap!  He takes a nap, wakes up, and calls her darling, and two seconds later, they want to get ""hitched, not itch.""  When did sarcasm and disrespect turn into foreplay?  It's been my experience that when people have that level of hatred for one another it's neither funny nor the sound basis of a good marriage.  Yet, they marry 3 times: in German, in French, and by the army.
I was stunned when I learned this was based on Henri Rochard's biography, I Was An Alien Spouse Of Female Military Personnel Enroute To The United States Under Public Law 271 Of The Congress.  One has to assume then that this was a true story (except for being French, Henri Rochard was Belgian).  If true, I can't help but wonder how long that marriage lasted and was it perfectly harmonious from that point on?
At any rate, I didn't/couldn't enjoy this movie because the level of anger was too off-putting to be considered funny.  I don't enjoy watching ill-treatment of anyone by anyone and certainly not for entertainment sake.  Unless this was a promotion for anger management or marriage counseling, I don't see what purpose it served.  I'd rather watch His Girl Friday, The Philadelphia Story, or anything Grant did with Hitchcock (multiple times) then put myself through this again.  Not a keeper and I'm actually sorry I watched it in the first place.",1313452800,4,2282,4.717171717171717
565187,5,6303102441,I enjoyed this movie even more then I did before. It's too bad that the current movie makers can't make good movies like this.,1300233600,,126,4.291666666666667
565188,4,6303102441,"This is based on a true story, believe it or not. In postwar Germany, French Army Captain Henri Rochard (Grant) and American WAC Lieutenant Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) fiercely don't get along, only they keep getting paired up on missions. Still, no one will be flabbergasted to learn that Henri and Catherine eventually fall in love and decide to marry. We get a hint of what Cary Grant is in for when the happy couple must undergo three marriage ceremonies, one dictated by German civic regs. Back in the day, in an era in which movies culminate in wedding vows, their getting married halfway thru the film was a fresh twist, even subversive.

On her wedding night, when Catherine's new marching orders call for her to report back to American soil, is when the film really puts Grant thru his paces. Seeking a way to pass thru the U.S. border, Henri, a foreigner, finds a loophole in the shape of a Congressional Act called Public Law #271 which regulates the immigration of war brides. Of course, the closed-minded military assumption is that since Henri is the spouse of a U.S. Armed Forces officer, Henri by default must be a woman.

1949's I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE isn't the best Cary Grant screwball comedy, but it does offer plenty of really funny moments and a pace that moves. Never mind that Grant doesn't even try to affect a French accent. Grant owns whatever film he's in, and it's no different here. This iconic guy was celebrated for his patented urbane demeanor and his knack for physical slapstick, for his classic good looks and his distinctive line delivery. But, to me, what made him so awesome were the sublime expressions that crawled across his face as he reacted to whatever zany stuff was going on around him. No one pulled off looking bemused like Cary Grant, at least not in such a way that you break out in hysterical giggles. Director Howard Hawks relished undercutting Grant's dignity, and with great comedic results - for further demonstration, I submit BRINGING UP BABY and HIS GIRL FRIDAY (but stay away from MONKEY BUSINESS). This time around Grant is subjected to ever-deeper humiliations thanks to the obtuseness of military bureaucracy. There's something quite funny about Grant spending much of the film filling out forms and looking really irritated doing it. You'd think that the sequence in which he disconsolately wanders from billet to billet in search of a bed to sleep in would be the lowest experience for our guy. But that's only until the war bride ship won't allow him on board, this then inspiring an off-screen quick change into drag. Oh, Farce, thou art the hair off a horse's bum.

And the love interest? I'm not that familiar with Ann Sheridan, but she nicely fits the mold of the sassy, fast-talking Hawksian heroine. Sheridan matches Grant banter for banter, which is what counts most in a screwball romp. I thought she was great.

This review's drinking game: take a shot each time Grant declares: ""I am an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the United States under Public Law 271 of the Congress."" He says that a lot.",1297036800,2,3096,4.738404452690167

Neither like each other then (of course) fall madly in love (in a hay stack, of all places). They get married, mix ups ensue, they have to get him legally in to America but all the rules are written for war Brides (not war Husbands). Cary Grant has to get aboard the departing ship to America but can only do it if he disguises himself as a war Bride. As handsome as he is, he does not make a good looking woman!

565246,2,6303102441,"I'm always game for a Cary Grant movie.  I've found that he is very good at comedy, romance, and, somewhat, drama.  This movie is definitely in the comedy class and Grant does well enough but the movie suffers from two insurmountable shortcomings; a bad script and a bad straight man (in this case, in keeping with the role reversal theme, a straight woman).  A lot of people don't appreciate the value of a good straight man but most comics in a situational humor setting can't really succeed without one.  Ann Sheridan may be the B Movie answer to Rita Hayworth but she seems to have no sense of how to deliver her lines in ""I was a Male War Bride"".  What makes things worse is the punch lines and supposedly comical situations aren't much to begin with.  For example, the movie adds a few unneccesary moments to try and work in a version of the old Wet Paint gag.  It came across as a speed bump in an already slow-moving film.

 I will acknowledge that things pick up towards the end of the movie when we get a good set of sequences on military red tape and its' inability to deal with anything unexpected.  However, by the time that began to emerge, I was already wondering why this movie was taking so long to end.  I see lots of great reviews on this film so maybe your sense of humor jump starts a lot quicker than mine.

565353,5,6303102441,"Howard Hawks's ""I Was a Male War Bride""(1949) is one of the most funny movies with Cary Grant I've ever seen. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most hilarious movies ever. The story is set in a postwar Germany, with ruins on the background, but the life seemingly coming more or less to normal. Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) is a French Captain from the French Economic mission, who is often supported in his missions by the US Army Lieutenant Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan), a sharp-tongued female interpreter. From the very first scene in the movie, when Henri finds Catherine in her office to (quite publicly) return her very personal belongings he'd gotten by mistake in their previous trip, one can see a certain level of attraction, masked by a fierce, but very funny bickering on the subject of their previous work together. As fate would have it, for his new mission Henri is slated to go with Catherine again. The news does not seem to bode well with Henri, who seemed to have had a certain share of mishaps during their previous missions together, which he fully attributed to Catherine. However, he does not have much of a choice and off they go on a search for a skilled lens grafter in Bad Neuheim to save the poor man from the clutches of the black market and put his services to the benefit of society. Catherine's no-nonsense attitude does indeed put poor Henri into some very precarious situations from time to time, but it's not intentional, and Henri gradually comes to realize that. What's more, they grow more and more attached to each other during that trip until they realize that they love each other and want to get married. That's where the most oddball part of the movie begins. Since Catherine is still an officer of the US Army, the marriage has to be approved through the Army channels, causing a lot of consternation and anxiety to the two love birds and really testing their intent to marry. With the marriage finally happening (three times!) life should be full of roses for the newlyweds, but the Army had to have a final laugh and Catherine is ordered to go back to the States right away. Henri is an alien and it would be a matter of a long time before he gets all the papers allowing him to join her in the US. They are running around the bureaucratic offices, trying to secure Henri's departure with her, but it's all in vain, until one of the officials gives them an idea to use the congressional Act granting wider opportunities for the war brides to enter the United States. The only problem is Henri's not a woman! They do manage to get him the war bride status, which leads to more hilarious situations - like poor Henri filling in the questionnaire, where one of the standard questions is whether Mrs. So-and So is pregnant and how many months along! All this finally out of the way exhausted Henri and Catherine reach after all the last obstacle on their trip to the States - the Navy guards are not letting Henri on board the ship and the ship is just about to leave. In a sudden stroke of inspiration, Catherine disguises Henri in the uniform of the Army nurse and they sneak on board of the ship past the sailors. They do get caught eventually, after a hysterical episode when Henri is called upon to fulfill the nurse's duty during childbirth, but the ship is already at sea and nothing can be done about it. They do get to see the Statue of Liberty together after all.

The DVD picture quality is not all that great, just tolerable - apparently they could not do much restoration on it. The special features include the usual Still Gallery, the original trailers, Cary Grant Theater feature - about his other famous films - and a couple of short mute documentary reels on the making of the movies and its first release.",1134259200,4,3770,4.535976505139501
565354,1,6303102441,"To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that ""mean streak"" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, ""Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..."" but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on.",1130630400,3,1717,3.9768115942028985
565355,5,6303102441,"This is a cool, quiet comedy that floats just below the radar of what we ordinarily consider comedy to be (actually, this is very similar to the British Ealing comedies of the same era).  Cary is a master of subtle comedy.  He can say more with a straight face than anyone since Buster Keaton, and he is perfectly cast with Ann Sheridan here, who matches Cary's every nuance of subtlety and intelligence. The movie deftly skewers that oxymoron we all know and loathe: ""military intelligence"".  There are some priceless lines throughout, like the Permission To Immigrate To The US form that Cary must sign, which asks hilariously inane questions like ""name your father's gender"".  The military is so shortsighted and inflexible, poor Cary ultimately has no choice if he wants to get into the US - he not only has to lie about his identity, but his gender as well.  I first saw this movie some twenty-plus years ago and was amazed at how ahead of its time it was in terms of being a `gender-bender' comedy.  I was also amazed that it had never been as popular as some of the other comedies of the period (the French caught on early, and they still embrace this film as one of Hawks' best).  It has gradually been discovered and embraced by newer audiences, and it's about time.  It's not as wild or raucous as say, ""Some Like it Hot"", but it covers as much distance.  And I don't care what anybody says, Cary does have sexy gams!  [hubba! hubba!]",1115596800,33,1444,4.54054054054054
565395,2,6303102441,"I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one. The storyline itself is funny, but not the antics. To sum it up, I found it slow moving and dull.",1112400000,,164,3.7142857142857144
565396,3,6303102441,"Compared to such classics as Bringing Up Baby and Mr. Blandings Build His Dream House, Grant is not in top comedic form here. I agree with a previous reviewer that the pacing of the movie is off and lacks that true screwball energy. But it is still pleasant and fun. Be ready to suspend your disbelief, too, because Grant is about as French as Tony Blair.",1101513600,,355,4.393939393939394
565397,5,6303102441,"They don't make 'em like ""I Was a Male War Bride"" anymore. Hawks made this wonderfully silly flick when such masters of comedic direction such as Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges and George Cukor were at their peak; the great Ernst Lubitsch had passed on just the year before.

Yet, Hawks had a sense of comic timing that probably died with him as a trade secret: You don't even need to see the titles to a Howard Hawks picture -- his fingerprints are all over the pacing, the quick banter and the editing. Even in such diverse movies as ""The Big Sleep"" (film noir melodrama) and ""El Dorado (Western), Hawks always directed with the light touch: Never imposing, but always keenly felt. ""I Was a Male War Bride"" is no exception.

The screen chemistry between Cary Grant as the French Army officer Henri Rochard and Ann Sheridan as American Lt. Catherine Gates is electric, even better than Grant and Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby.""

The ridiculous plot was conjured by two of screwball comedy's great screenwriters, Hagar Wilde (""Bringing Up Baby,"" 1938) and Charles Lederer (""His Girl Friday,"" 1940), both of which were directed by Hawks. Still, this movie is so deftly made that audiences can't get enough of the attraction masquerading as repulsion sexual tension between the love-struck leads.

This movie is also a real hoot for anyone who's ever served in the Army in Germany: It was shot on location, and watching Cary wade through the military acronyms and red-tape in triplicate rings true.

If you want to forget your troubles for a couple hours and take a fun romp through postwar Europe, this is your ticket. Ann Sheridan is hot, and there's a cute scene where Cary massages her shapely gams for that nice gratuitous touch Hawks always gives. Sure, casting Cary Grant as a Frenchman is even more of a stretch than watching Chuck Heston play a Mexican in Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil,"" but so what! There never has been any actor who could touch him with a ten foot pole in the screwball movies. He was a great physical comedian and watching him get flustered is always priceless.",1097712000,4,2086,4.735537190082645
565398,5,6303102441,"This film was destined to be a ""classic"", after all Howard Hawks had been responsible for both, Cary Grant's masterpiece of the screwball comedy ""Bringing Up Baby"" (opposite Kate Hepburn) and one the fastest-paced-dialogue-comedies ever, the great ""His Girl Friday"" starring Grant and Rosalind Russell.

It's a pity that Cary Grant and Ann Sheridan weren't ever teamed up again, because it's such a wonderful and great chemistry that develops between these two stars!; I'm short of words in praising their talent, especially since at the beginning of the picture they have to ""work-out"" this weird ""love & hate relationship"".

Grant plays a french captain on duty in Germany, after World War II, who's had shared too many missions and lots of ""experiences"" together, with American lieutenant (Sheridan), but in this last mission together, they're going to have (unknowingly) one of the greatest adventures of their whole lives, with exhilarating results!!!

It had been a time since I had laughed so loudly with a movie, `cos, especially, the second half of the movie is plain ""irresistible"", if you don't get a kick out of this film you might be well dead. I cannot praise enough this pic!

565399,5,6303102441,"I saw this movie on TV for the first time a couple years ago. I have been looking for a copy of it DVD ever since. Thank goodness it's finally out.
When I saw this movie for the first time, I laughed harder than I had for any other Cary Grant movie (Or any classic movie for that matter). This movie is seriously funny and I would stack it up against any comedy by any actor to date. I will admit that it isn't Grant's best performance. He has done so many great movies that a lighthearted comedy like this isn't going to go down as another of his oscar-caliber performances. All that aside, this is a hilarious movie and well worth the purchase.
The storyline for this movie is just terrific. It gives Grant plenty of room to be flustered. Being flustered is something that Cary Grant does better than any other actor in the history of film. If you thought you had seen the best of it in ""Bringing up Baby,"" you really need to take a look at this one. Cary Grant endures every imaginable calamity with his classic poise.
If you want to see Cary Grant endure abuse from a woman he can't stand (ie Father Goose, Bringing Up Baby) only to fall in love with her in the end, this is your movie. I know that might sound a little formulaic (especially for a Cary Grant movie) but this one is a cut above the rest. As stated before, this isn't going to be remembered as one of the greatest movies of all time, but for a movie that you can just sit down and enjoy, this is one of my favorites.",1084838400,3,1485,4.177700348432055
565400,1,6303102441,"Howard Hawk's ""I Was A Male War Bride"" has become a benchmark in screwball comedy.

In this wonderful film which is based on a true story, and set in Germany just at the end of WWII, Cary Grant plays slightly cranky, but ever so charming French Army officer Henri Rochard. Ann Sheridan plays the American Army Lieutenant Catherine Gates who is sent on several assignments with him for the French Economic Mission.
They have a seemingly hate/hate relationship (on a previous occasion she pushes him into a vat of blue dye - in fact some part of him is still blue, but we are not told which part!)
In true screwball comedy fashion they set off on a motorbike on their mission and it is only after they end up in the middle of a haystack that they admit their true feelings.
Having decided to get married, they discover that they are tied up in a whole roll of military red tape, and have to forego their wedding night to travel back to the States. BUT - the only way Henri can gain entry to the States is as a warbride - well, you can imagine the comic possibilities to be made out of that one!
He is unable to get on the boat until he dresses up as a female American Army officer, complete with a very fetching bob made out of a horse's tail. He makes a horrible woman, but oh what a gorgeous man!
I loved this film. It is a brilliant, sparkling comedy that leaves you with a big smile on your face for ages afterwards. The barbed banter between Cary Grant and Ann Sheridan is spot on. Some of my favourite scenes - Henri trapped in Catherine's bedroom and how awkward and uncomfortable he looks trying to sleep on the chair (he never seems to be able to get a decent bed for the night!), the scene where he is filling out the form which is patently designed for female warbrides - the question ""Any female trouble?"" is met with a terse ""Nothing but, sergeant""!

565402,4,6303102441,"Cary Grant stars as a French officer looking into the black market in postwar Occupied Germany.  He is assigned American officer Ann Sheridan as an assistant, a woman with whom he has had a previous relationship which appears to have ended badly. There are obvious sparks between them, and as they endure a series of misadventures (usually at the expense of Grant), they become close again, marry, and then face another series of misadventures as they try to find a way to get Grant back to the U.S. as a ""war bride"".  Grant is in good comedic form here, although a little sour as the Frenchman who finds the road to romance filled with more than a few potholes.  Sheridan, sometimes wasted in her earlier roles at Warner Bros, is warm and engaging and has very good chemistry with Grant.  There are a number of good lines and fun situations for the twosome, and the sight of Grant in drag, with the worst wig imaginable, is well worth a good laugh.  But I did find the pacing of the movie to be off a bit, which surprised me given that the film was directed by the great Howard Hawks.
