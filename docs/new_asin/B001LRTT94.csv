I didn't know the title (and got no help when I called Air France), but was able to track the film down through the biography of one of the actresses whose name I did remember.  It's a haunting story, and based on a real life experience. This is one of my favorite films!!",1453420800,,332,4.171875
8319757,5,B001LRTT94,"I really like the two main actresses, and they don't disappoint in this movie. This subject is not often covered in cinema, and they made a great job showing it in a realistic and believable manner. Watch it, you will not regret it. I should probably watch it again now that I know how it ends, however, I want to leave enough time between viewings not to spoil the impression left by the first one.",1396742400,,399,4.333333333333333
