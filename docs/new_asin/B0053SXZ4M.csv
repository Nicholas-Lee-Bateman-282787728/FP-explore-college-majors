The instructor is very clear, specific, and there are no distractions...just pure yoga moves for kids. My 22 month old loves it!",1324252800,,270,4.645833333333333
8455623,5,B0053SXZ4M,"I purchased this DVD with hopes of doing yoga with my 27 month old daughter.  I figured I would be getting some exercise AND entertaining her at the same time.  This DVD is *excellent* for beginners and those with experience.  In fact, I think of all the years I spent wasting $20/class on yoga classes when the routines on this DVD are practically the same!  The pace is excellent, and the instructor makes it fun and easy to follow for both kids and grown ups!

Obviously, I enjoyed this DVD very much.  My daughter is warming up to it after watching me do it a few times.  Usually she will be playing around me while I am doing it... stop once in awhile to join in... and then start running around me playing again.  I can't really expect much more given her age and attention span.  However, I have no doubt that she is taking it all in and learning the poses as I am doing them around her.  I expect in a few weeks she will be participating more and more with me as I make it our routine!

My one and only complaint is I expected to see more children doing the yoga (as the DVD cover shows).  I thought seeing other toddlers would inspire her to want to do it as well.  I was pretty disappointed that the children are NOT doing it along with the instructor.  But the good thing is the set is nice and clean and white, and the instructor is wearing bright pretty colors with a very nice smile so overall it is still appealing to children.

I can't emphasize more how wonderful this DVD is, even as a basic yoga DVD for beginners and those we want some daily routines.  Before this DVD I purchased several books to teach toddlers yoga (I don't like my daughter watching TV), but it was too difficult without the actual visuals.  I will probably make my tough motorcycle riding husband join in as well.  It is THAT easy and comprehensive for anyone who wants to learn yoga!",1312588800,2,1875,4.293447293447294
8455624,5,B0053SXZ4M,I love how much my 2.5 year old loves this video! She does yoga at daycare and now has a chance to learn from a skilled instructor whenever she wants at home. I can't thank this DVD enough for teaching her a great way to channel her energy at such a young age. The instructor is fabulous to watch and I even find myself doing the routines along with her! Fabulous fabulous!,1308700800,3,373,4.194444444444445
8455625,5,B0053SXZ4M,"This DVD helps young ones to ""do yoga"". Is age appropriate for 2+. Believe 5-6 year olds would be engaged. Great for both boys and girls DVD features just the instructor and her yoga mat NO DISTRACTIONS! My 3 year old grandaughter loves it!
