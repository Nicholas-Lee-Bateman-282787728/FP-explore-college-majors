7383950,5,B0145UQS1A,"Finally, Dairanger is here!
Prerelease:
Note: I'll do a full review when the set is released, so don't reply with ""this isn't a real review.""
Gosei Sentai Dairanger, I've heard, is a good Sentai season. Being the source footage they used in MMPR season 2, where they took the mech & white ranger footage & repurposed them for MMPR. Now, this DVD won't have special features, which I'm fine with. Zyuranger only had that 1 special feature because Power Morphicon was last year. They could've tried to port over some of the special features from the Japanese DVD releases, but that might've driven up the price of the thing even further, so I'm fine with it. Hopefully they'll get the movie out eventually. I'm not expecting the set up to be much different than the Zyuranger release, 50 episodes, 10 discs, subtitles, all that stuff. It's looking good for this release.
Post Release:
I watched almost the entire first disc & it isn't bad. The video & audio quality, minus most of the episode previews, are very good quality. Apparently Toei gave Shout! a slightly different kind of master for the episodes than Zyuranger, but it's hardly noticeable, if at all. The subs, I've heard, are also a bit better with quality & consistency with terminologies they decided to use, so if anyone had any qualms with the Zyuranger release subs, there you go. So, yeah, 10/10 as far as I'm concerned.
There aren't any extras on the release, which is completely understandable for multiple reasons, so no big loss there for me.
Another great release. Your mileage may vary, as with everthing, but if you're yearning to see the source material to MMPR season 2, I'd definitely recommend this set.",1440288000,4,1680,4.776632302405498

7383955,5,B0145UQS1A,"This was the first series of Sentai that I watched all of the way theough, and it is the best I have seen so far. The characters are spot on, the villains are a legit threat, and the visual effects are very well done given the time and budget of the series. At first I was unsure of Kou the Kiba (white) ranger, but he grew on me to become one of my favorite characters in the show. Everything in this series is spot on; it is humorous when it needs to be, but it is also dark and at times shockingly violent, so keep that in mind before purchasing this for a child, because there is blood in this show. With a great story and great characters to go along with it, Dairanger is one series of Sentai to not be missed.

If you consider yourself even a passing fan of Power Rangers from the good ol' days of the 90's, then you owe it to yourself to at least give Dairanger a shot. Chances are high that the 90's nostalgia will combine with the top-notch martial arts action and have you marathon the entire show.in huge chunks. What's more, if you like it at all, you'll probably like it enough to rewatch the show over and over; it's THAT good.

Zyuranger was amazing and I loved it, but then I watched Dairanger and loved it even more. This show is much darker than Zyuranger in both theme and story. The story and characters are so well thought out and well written that you are so captivated by the events in each episode, especially the ones with Kou (Kiba Ranger); they are so intense and yes there are times where I was bawling my eyes out. I absolutely FELL IN LOVE with Dairanger. Even after now finished watching Kakuranger, which is also great, I still think this show was the best I've seen so far. It's just too good not to love. I recommend every ranger fan to buy this series, you will love it!

7383979,4,B0145UQS1A,"Gosei Sentai Dairanger is a favorite season of mine in the Super Sentai series and might have my favorite opening song of any Super Sentai. It has a great story influenced by Chinese epics and amazing fight choreography. Coming after the rather goofy Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger, the antagonists here are often much more menacing and sinister. The Dairangers themselves are a lively bunch, benefiting from the decreased focus on little kids of the day that Zyuranger had (although Kazu never quite comes into focus and gets the least amount of development). As a kid I had a fear of faceless people, so the cotpotros are the creepiest Super Sentai combatants for me with their smooth white faces, the only feature being small lips. The appearance of a new, unrelated antagonist for the Dairangers to deal with was a brilliant twist that shook things up a little. I love the shameless Star Wars ripoff, compressing The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi to an episode each. The music is some of my favorite ever in Super Sentai.

It has its problems, most infamous being Ko and his sexual harassment of Lin (an element thankfully dropped a few episodes after his introduction), and the old man marrying a much younger woman is rather creepy (and the Dairangers agree). Unless you think Kazu is gay for being a hairstylist and slightly effeminate, the only LGBT character seems to be the offensively camp General Cactus who minces around with pink fingernails and dresses little girls like dolls (maybe he was made so camp so it wouldn't look like he was molesting the girls, although he does get touchy with one of the girls' fathers). The Bird Cage Vagabond is one Mexican stereotype after another and was wisely dropped from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The Gorma Monsters themselves aren't the most inspired Super Sentai monsters in general, mostly being a humanoid combined with an inanimate object or a concept, often with a single eye; they look weak compared to the fanciful Dora Monsters of Zyuranger. In fairness, this was probably so the stunt actors could fight more believably given the Chinese martial arts theme of the show. The giant robot fights aren't very impressive either; once the Gorma Monsters grow huge the Dairangers have no trouble at all killing them.

For all the problems I listed, I love this show and would have given it five stars were it not for Shout! Factory's flawed release. Some of the translation choices were rather strange, the biggest being that Kirinranger was translated into Mandarin to become Qilin Ranger but none of the other Dairangers were translated in this way; Ryo's still Ryu Ranger instead of Long Ranger, Lin's still Houou Ranger instead of Fenghuang Ranger, and so on. Why is Kazu the only one who got this? Similarly, kiryoku is translated as ch'i power but yoryoku is translated as yo power instead of yao power. All of the Chinese characters' names are left in Japanese so we get Kaku instead of Jia Xu, Guhon instead of Yu Fan, etc., obscuring that they were named after real figures in Chinese history. There was one bit where the translator didn't know the Mandarin word laojiu (fermented drink) and left it in the phonetic Japanese raochu.

The translation problems don't end with the Chinese elements; a bit of the Japanese is inconsistent and mistranslated. Jin Matoba's style is called Hyogaryu, meaning ""panther fang style"". The subtitles translate this as Hyoga style at first, then abruptly switch to Glacier style (the Japanese word for glacier is also hyoga). OK, so we don't see Hyogaryu written anywhere in the show so the translator just made a guess, but the kanji for Hyogaryu is quite common on Japanese fansites; a quick Internet search would have corrected this mistake.

Finally, the Dairanger movie isn't included. It's not great and feels more like a Zyuranger episode, but it really should be here for the sake of completeness.

All in all, I do recommend this release for all the problems I have with it. None of it will seriously impact your viewing and I want more official Super Sentai releases (and I really hope that one day Kamen Rider and Metal Hero will be translated too). Looking forward to Shout! Factory's edition of Ninja Sentai Kakuranger!",1460332800,,4242,4.869806094182826

Dairanger is a fun little romp with its motifs of Chinese mythology and martial arts and unique approach to story and action in a Sentai series.
The fact we got Tommy back in MMPR for his White Ranger powers and the ""Thunder Zords"" by using footage from this series makes this a must own to make sense of things in the edited footage  that didn't add up originally or just for laughs and crowning moments of awesome!

GO FORTH! Purchase! The fate of Super Sentai in the USA rests within your wallet, and we are getting to the really good stuff!  (And really, WE want the good stuff!)

7383994,4,B0145UQS1A,"Most US viewers probably have started their Super Sentai journey because of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and got the Zyuranger set to compare and contrast the differences between the two shows.  With Dairanger, it's a different story.  Most people know the ""zords"" and the ""white ranger"" made the transition, but nothing else.  And I'm sure a good many of you are wondering ""why?""

This show doesn't answers these questions, and almost gives you some new ones.  The Dairanger costumes are great, the fight scenes are on par with Zyurangers, and the premise of using Chinese mythology as a theme works.  Sooo why not use the footage?  The answer can be a bit confusing, but let's just say that if you came into Super Sentai because of Zyurangers, you won't be disappointed with Dairanger.

Of course, for Sentai fans beyond the Power Ranger fanbase, finally having something on DVD instead of having to watch it on Youtube is great.  I'm very appreciative to ShoutFactory for releasing these, though I can't say Dairangers was one of my favorites.  Still I want to support them as well as start collecting Sentai shows.  It's nice to watch them via DVD over a grainy online video.

The translation can be a bit off though, but only on minor things.  Most of the changes are for honorifics and some japanese cultural context that wouldn't translate well into English.  (Such as a man calling another man kawaii or -chan as an insult, or calling the character by their name instead of ""big brother"".  That sort of thing).  The original intent is still there, it's just worded or phrased different.  I wouldn't say this hurts the show, but purist will definitely notice it.

Overall this is a 90s sentai show, so don't expect Shakespeare.  Still, as a Sentai fan, I sat down and watched this with my sister who had only seen Power Rangers, and she was engaged.  It's so wacky and but plays it straight, for anyone who loves the cheese factor to these shows, it's great.  I was shocked that she wanted to continue watching it beyond the first few episodes, as she didn't even have familiar costumes to relate too.  And really I think it's that curious factor.  She wanted to know how the Japanese did it over the US.

ANYWAY, I'm not sure if this review helped.  Sentai Fans are going to buy this regardless, and casual fans?  Well I guess they might if they are curious, but I'd imagine they are just waiting for Kakuranger.  Please Shout Factory, keep these coming!",1452384000,18,2463,4.69392523364486
7383995,5,B0145UQS1A,"Dairanger is simply a phenomenal series in the Super Sentai franchise with a lot of great story arcs and very little filler (only 6 episodes in fact).

Even the villians, and the monsters du jour have fleshed out (albeit unusual) personalities.  Over 50 episodes, we learn the story of the centuries-old war between the Dai and Gorma Clans...complete with a very shocking revelation at about Episode 40, propelling the series to an exciting and satisfying conclusion.

7384002,5,B0145UQS1A,"I have been a Power Rangers fan for over 20 years. Gosei Sentai Dairanger is one of my top favorite Sentai seasons. If you are confused about Dairanger, I will give you an hint.; KibaRanger, the kicka$$ mechas, and the monsters. BINGO, they are adapted for the second season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers due to its popularity. Dairanger is one of the darkest Sentai seasons, so Dairangers had more episodes than Mighty Morphin Power Rangers season 2, some of the villains will experience love and friendship from the Dairangers even the villains betraying each other. For the first time, a kid will be a Ranger in this Sentai season. In this season, the six Dairangers are fighting an evil army called the Gorma Tribe who were lead by a cruel commander named Shadam or Earth will be doomed. If you are a fan of Power Rangers, I recommended Dairanger. I wish Shout Factory to release more Sentai seasons like Jetman, Maskman, Liveman, Fiveman, Sun Vulcan, Turboranger, Flashman, Kakuranger and Ohranger. TENSHIN DAA!",1447372800,6,1018,4.890173410404624
7384003,5,B0145UQS1A,"I don't like Power Rangers.  Sure, I grew up with it, but it never really stuck.  I liked the suits, the kicks, the lasers, blah blah blah.  I saw the Power Rangers films in theaters, but aside from Tommy (the cool one), Kim (the hot one), and Billy (the dork and best character), I can't recall anything from my childhood of watching PR.  About a year ago, I was sick for two weeks and decide I was going to nostalgia binge while bedridden.  I ran through the entire original series during that time.  Growing up hasn't done it any favors.

Super Sentai, though?  Probably the greatest superhero franchise of all-time.  And Dairanger here, after the good-but-not-great season that is Zyuranger, is an excellent example why.

Greatest superhero franchise of all-time?  Yeah, it's an opinion, but let me explain.  Super Sentai demonstrates, better than any franchise, what it means to be a hero.  Superman?  Naturally gifted, basically no chance of losing, essentially a god.  He's not relatable at all.  Batman?  Bought his way to being a hero, inspired by revenge.  Hires ""sidekicks"" superior to him to play second fiddle, to primarily boost his ego.  Bruce Wayne isn't all that heroic.  Iron Man is a alcoholic, womanizing business tycoon, the X-Men are more peaceful resistance group than heroes, Spider-Man is INCREDIBLY selfish, I could go on all day.  The Super Sentai?  The only superheroes with everything to lose, and the willingness to sacrifice it all for others, for their world, while having the doubts and fears about such lofty expectations placed upon them.

Rangers are replaceable.  Sure, they're ""special"", but they're not the only special ones.  A new team has come each season for nearly 40 seasons, facing new struggles every time.  Because in the real world, a hero doesn't fight forever.  A real hero selflessly passes the torch when the time comes.

Rangers die.  Not every year, but with a great enough frequency that your favorite characters never feel invincible.  Heroes die.  It's a sad reality.

These values are packaged into a children's show.  Super Sentai is a show that teaches young people to idolize great people.  Beyond that, no superhero franchise has captured the sheer variety of human emotions that Super Sentai does.  Watching all the seasons plays out like watching an alternate version of human history, with fantastically silly monsters, unlikely friendships, villains with understandable motives, and much, much more.

Out of the almost 40 seasons, Dairanger is almost definitely a top 5 season, a large step above its predecessor Zyuranger.

Perhaps the most important difference between Zyuranger and Dairanger is the quality time spent on the characters.  With Zyuranger, the characters always seemed out of reach of the audience.  They were resurrected ancient warriors, out of place and out of time with the world they inhabited, which caused the series to feel stilted.  With Dairanger, the characters are all modern young adults (and one modern child), who all receive their own arcs and rivals, fleshed out with aspects of comedy, tragedy, romance, and a healthy dose of legitimately solid martial arts action (even out of costume).

I really don't want to spoil what is a truly special show, so I won't say much more, aside from that if you have never seen a Super Sentai, this is an excellent one to start with.  While not my personal favorite, this is probably the most well-rounded of all of the seasons.  I can't think of a better entry point.  I implore you to give this franchise a chance, regardless of whether Power Rangers is your thing.  Shout! Factory will bring more excellent series stateside if this sells well, and these 50 episodes are worth every penny.

7384005,5,B0145UQS1A,"I watched Gosei Sentai Dairanger online a few years ago and was hooked, I am excited that Shout Factory is releasing this Super Sentai Series on DVD because it is really great to see the origins of Power Rangers.",1446854400,2,212,4.461538461538462
7384006,5,B0145UQS1A,"Our second released Sentai into the states by Shout! Factory and man is it a good season. It's awesome to see the origins of the second season of MMPR (mainly the Monsters and the Sixth White Ranger we all know) as of course it has many differences. Even without any special features nor the Dairanger movie (which honestly the older Sentai movies aren't any longer than a normal episode) this is a fantastic release! Sound and Picture quality are DVD transfers from Japan so their wasn't too much to do then add subtitles which are very good in my opinion for this release. I feel overall I enjoy this season a little more so then Zyuranger and I'm sincerely hoping it does well so we can get ""Kakuranger"" into the states as well. Otherwise definitely worth owning if you enjoy Power Rangers/Super Sentai and wish to have more seasons be released  in the near future.

P.S I ordered from Shout! Factory's website and they shipped it two weeks early which is why I wrote a review now",1445990400,9,983,4.548022598870056

My thoughts on official Super Sentai releases in North America: personally, I wish that some of the Showa-era shows would be considered for distribution, especially Himitsu Sentai GoRanger.",1440547200,8,645,5.262135922330097

8729786,1,B0145UQS1A,I love Super Sentai BUT I hate SHOUT Factory for releasing Dairanger.... This cost way too much and on top of that the subs are not even good. It feels like they literal translate and not even use colloquialisms. Also it feels like it was put through Google translate. I would not support something that is poorly translated and not done properly. I have seen better subs from Fan subs than this. #SorryNotSorry If they took the time and used better subbers then I would have said it was worth it but....,1524960000,,504,4.489130434782608

8729788,5,B0145UQS1A,"For anyone that has been a Power Rangers fan in the past should watch Super Sentai.  If you want probably one of the best to ever be released on DVD you can't go wrong with Dairanger.  The stories and characters are solid and the conclusion (the last 2 disk from this collection) are so amazing it makes for great TV.  This is definitely my in my top 5 of all Super Sentai. The first being Jetman (which if this could be released in the states I would be so happy).

You have many satisfying storylines and each character has a certain charm.  The theme is my favorite of all the series to come out. Tenshin daaa! (Woh Woh Woh Woh) Kiryoku daaa! (Woh Woh Woh Woh)  You know you're in for a great time watching this.

The villains are goofy simply because of the leather gear and it's just so freakin' awesome.

If you are a new fan this should be in your collection. You won't regret it.",1521504000,,887,4.238095238095238
8729789,5,B0145UQS1A,"When I was a kid, I remember being a big fan of the Power Rangers when it was Mighty Morphin.  I stopped watching the show after Season 2, losing interest in the show, as the second half of Season 2 seemed to go downhill.  At the time, I didn't know they were using footage from a Japanese T.V. show.  Power Rangers started out with Zyuranger footage.  After Zyuragner came Dairanger, they use footage from this show in Season 2.  The zords were from Dairanger.  Some of the monsters we see in Season 2 were from Dairanger.  Though, they kept their original Zyuranger costumes during the 2nd Season in Power Rangers, minus Tommy the White Ranger's.  I'm sure very few American kids knew back then that the White Ranger/Tommy was originally played by a Japanese kid, Kou/Kibaranger.  We also get a new villain in Season 2 of Power Rangers, Lord Zedd who was American, while they kept Rita and her henchmen.  Rita was Bandora in the Japanese counterpart.  In Dairanger, the villains are The Gorma.  After watching this show, I feel they should have just changed the Power Rangers costumes during Season 2 since they changed their zords.

Anyway, there are a lot of entertaining things that come from Japan.  Let's think about it, a lot of the video games we have played.  Iconic video game characters like Mario and Luigi along with Zelda.  We think of Japanese anime.  I've been a big fan of DragonBall Z.  Pokemon is also Japanese.  A year and a half ago, Pokemon Go was very popular.  Dairanger and Zyuranger are Japanese, Super Sentai and we've been familiar with their Power Rangers counterpart.  I'm familiar with a totally awesome Metal Heroes Japanese T.V. show that aired from 1988-1989 and was dubbed in Portuguese for Brazilians called Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya.  That show was awesome.  I find a lot of these Japanese shows more entertaining than high budget American Super Hero movies.  I'm going to list what they do better.

1.  More Perspective (My Friend Agreed With Me On That).
2.  More Relatable (The Things The Characters Go Through Both Main And Side Characters Seem More Relatable).
3.  More Focus On Characters (There's Even More Of A Focus On The Villains Story We Don't See In Power Rangers).
4.  Characters Are Better At Showing Emotion (That Makes You Feel More For Them).
5.  More Suspense (That Keeps You Watching).
6.  Frequently Having Scenes Of Nature And The Simple Things Of Life (Including Flowers And Animals, Focusing On Real Things).
7.  Coming Up With More Unique Interesting Things (When Power Rangers First Aired, This Was New And Unique To American Audiences).
8.  Often Times More Action And More Violence (This Show Has Scenes Of Characters Spitting Out Blood).
9.  Focus On Martial Arts (I Feel Like A Lot Of American Super Hero Movies Including Power Rangers Focus On Super Power And Not Martial Arts).
10.  Show More Character Development And Getting Physically Stronger.  (D.B.Z. Shows Lots Of That).
11.  More Variety (Think Of How Many Pokemon There Are And Their Different Powers)?
12.  Songs Played For Different Scenes (I've Noticed Japanese Music Comes Up With New Songs That Occasionally Play During Certain Scenes Besides The Opening Song, In Dairanger It Would Be ""Kaze No Senshi"").
13.  Character Stances (Stances They Make While Fighting).
14.  More Focus On Storyline (I've Seen People Complaining About American SuperHero Movies Focussing More On The Action And Special Effects, And Less On The Characters And Storyline.  The Storyline In Shows Like Dairanger Are Entertaining And Keep You Watching).
15.  Often Times Easier To Understand  (I Have Trouble Understanding A Lot Of American SuperHero Movies, But These Japanese Shows Feel Easier To Understand).
16.  Better Direction (I've Heard Of People Complaining About Plot Holes And Bad Direction In Highly Rated American Super Hero Movies, These Japanese Shows Seem To Have Better Direction).

If you watched Power Rangers when it was Mighty Morphin, and saw Zyuranger, then definitely watch Dairanger.  I'm sure you'll be entertained.  In Dairanger, besides Martial Arts they also focus on Ki and interesting Super Powers.  I also ought to say that with the anime I mentioned, DragonBall Z, everybody who has seen that show knows it has long battles and takes numerous episodes for things to occur.  But, Dairanger is a 50 Episode series with better direction and where it isn't like 30 episodes to defeat a villain, like 2 at the most.  I've seen all 50 episodes, and was totally entertained.  Thanks for reading all this.  I wanted to say what I like about these Japanese shows that I feel are better written than even Harry Potter, which I like but feel is overrated and not as well done as Dairanger.  I could write more, but I'll stop here and wanted to give my reasons I find this and other Japanese shows more entertaining.",1520380800,,4843,4.885749385749386
