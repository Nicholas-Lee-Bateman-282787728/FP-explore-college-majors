8308704,1,B001HDXHQ8,"This documents the fanfare around the release of Episode 1 in 1999.

What I saw was a BAD documentary.
Bad editing, bad sound capture, bad lighting and bad directing overall.
The interviews were awkward. VERY awkward.
The director jumps around for no reasons during the narration.
The narrator doesn't have a good grasp of film history.
I had to sit through watching fans get harassed, fans fighting/cussing with Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Corrolla.
Some fans didn't even know the movies well.
Had to watch Star Trek protestors.
Some interviews were just plain offensive to Star Wars fans.

What I heard was obnoxious fans and their music, including opera music and bad rapping.
Had to listen to awkward interviews about peoples daddy issues and religious beliefs or lack thereof.
Had to listen to disappointed fans after they watched the movie mixed in with ignorant Lucas supporters.

In the end, I felt like the documentary was a waste of my time.
The way it ended was empty and the narrator didn't even seem to get his own documentary.

I put this DVD in the trash as soon as it was over. I recommend The People vs. George Lucas or Jedi Junkies over this movie.",1439683200,,1160,4.727722772277228

8308707,4,B001HDXHQ8,"A GALAXY FAR FAR  AWAY is a documentary about the STAR WARS phenomenon / fan base, ranging from the fanatical (waiting in line for 42 days to see PHANTOM MENACE) to the completely bonkers (STAR WARS as life / philosophy / religion). While it contains several interviews w/ fans at various conventions, along w/ comments by Roger Corman and a therapist, it also has quite a few celebrity cameos by the likes of Meat Loaf, Andy Garcia, Robert Logia, and Joe Pesci. AGFFA examines not only the fans, but also the mythology, merchandise, and mania of the STAR WARS sub-culture. My favorite part is the confrontation between Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Corolla, and the fans. Kimmel and Corolla cut in front of the line, causing a lot of anger! Also, the Trekkies protest is hilarious! Worth checking out...",1400544000,,793,4.788321167883212
8308708,5,B001HDXHQ8,"Like any documentary, it has it's ups and downs. But this documentary is an amusing look inside of a fandom that is full of overly obsessive fanboys and girls. And I say this with all the love in the world, seeing as I am one of those fangirls.",1360108800,,244,4.104166666666667
8308709,1,B001HDXHQ8,"Cinematography that looks like it was shot by a 5 year old, terrible audio and a message that basically says there's no God. How did this turn into an athiest documentary about star wars fans. The worst video I've seen all year.",1318723200,,228,4.4523809523809526
8308710,2,B001HDXHQ8,"I would not recommend this movie.  Few subjects are more interesting than Star Wars, and yet somehow the filmmakers struggle to put together an entertaining movie.

First of all, I would not even call this movie a ""documentary"".  Sure, the filmmakers interview fans and bring cameras to a few events.  But a lot of it feels staged or rehearsed.  Also, the filmmakers seem to focus on the biggest geeks and weirdest people they could find - at one point the narrator even insults the intelligence of the fans, stating that they ""aren't playing with a full deck"".  I would have also liked to have seen and heard from some more of the casual ""mainstream"" Star Wars fans.

From a pure filmmaking point of view, this is a low-quality production.  Obviously the filmmakers were working with a low/no budget, and that is fine.  But there is no reason why they couldn't have cleaned the camera lens.  Also, keep in mind that this movie is just over an hour long - and yet it feels that they only had about 10-20 minutes of interesting and relevant footage to work with.

If I could throw the movie a bit of praise, it comes toward the end where we get a sense of why people love Star Wars and how it has affected their life.  In this segment, many of the interviews seem to be more authentic and honest.",1318204800,,1295,4.463829787234043
8308711,5,B001HDXHQ8,"""A Galaxy Far Far Away""  is a documentary about the fan craze surrounding the motion picture ""Star Wars.""  In 1999, as the country eagerly anticipated the release of ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace,"" director Tariq Jalil decided to explore why ""Star Wars"" strikes such a mysterious and powerful chord across all races, genders, and generations.  The DVD features interviews with hundreds of fans, movie executives, and high-profile celebrities.  Jalil brings his camera to ""Star Wars"" conventions, nationwide premieres, the homes of dedicated collectors who show off their treasures, and on the lines to interview those who spent 42 days just to be among the first to see ""The Phantom Menace.""  Interviews and archival footage include Samuel L. Jackson, Joe Pesci, Roger Corman, Meat Loaf, Andy Garcia, Jimmy Kimmel, and ""Star Wars"" alumni David Prowse (Darth Vader), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), and Anthony Daniels (C3-PO).  Most amazing is the tunnel-visioned devotion of so many folks from average walks of life to the sci-fi franchise.",1241395200,,1057,5.375757575757576
