8351555,1,B00260LDT4,"First off, this movie draws you in with a fake review of the movie on the back and the cover of the movie is an absolute lie. This movie has nothing to do with racing at all. It's about some teens going around dealing with the dredges of life. The main ""hot chick"" of the movie, the main characters girlfriend, starts the movie a few months pregnant. She is then promptly replaced a few scenes later by a ""hot crackhead chick"" just because the main character almost runs her over and she tells him that she loves him when he gets out to help her to the sidewalk. He is ""stalked"" all through the movie by some guy in a black car who ends up sleeping with his chick who has had the kid by now. Makes you wonder where the baby is while they are both out screwing around on each other. Either way, pass this movie over if you're looking for something dealing with races. The only ""race"" scenes it does have, the cars aren't even going over 20mph.",1247097600,,942,4.209944751381215
