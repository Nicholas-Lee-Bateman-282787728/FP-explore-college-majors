3140368,5,B00153ZQSM,"Indeed, each Word World DVD is a hit (except Happy birthday Word Friends). My son watch it over and over and now he's 4 and a half and knows how to write at least 30 words with consonant-vowel-consonant and maybe 10 words made of 4 letters. That's a really good show for children learning English as a second language and native English speakers!",1277683200,,346,4.507936507936508
3140369,5,B00153ZQSM,Word world offers a bright and colorful viewing experience for my toddler.  She loves the characters (particlarly duck) and I love that she is starting to recognize the letters in their bodies.,1249603200,,193,5.03125
3140370,5,B00153ZQSM,"My toddler was a Diego junkie, heaven help me.  Luckily, we have no cable, so we could only watch on library DVDs or the few we bought ourselves.  A friend turned us onto Word World, and my little one switched cold-turkey from a Diego-holic to Word World.  We've bought several of them -- these are great to watch when you just need to make a phone call or whip together a recipe, and want to keep the baby busy.

I like the voices, I like the characters, the songs are *not* like Dora's ""I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the MAP!"", the visuals are clever, and the stories are funny.

Anyway, I am really strict about TV time, and Word World makes the grade.  Thanks, PBS -- this is a surprise hit.",1240704000,6,721,4.151079136690647
3140371,5,B00153ZQSM,"My 8 month old daughter loves this show! She claps and dances to the music and is just fascinated with it. We are collecting all of the characters right now for her - she loves to pull them apart and then stick them back together. They are great learning tools ... we use them to point out letters, the sounds they make, the sounds they make when they come together and then the word itself! A great association tool. I hope to have many more DVDs to come!",1235692800,4,456,4.193181818181818
3140372,5,B00153ZQSM,Good learning tool for young children. Helps identify letters and how they go together to form words in an entertaining format.,1229385600,,127,5.095238095238095
3140373,5,B00153ZQSM,I am a fan of this series of dvd's from public service television. My 2 year old really enjoys them and I think its great how they can keep her entertained but help with word cognition as well. It is a cute series. I hope they continue to make more. Highly recommended.,1229299200,,269,4.1923076923076925
3140374,5,B00153ZQSM,"We have all the Word World DVDs and will buy more as they come out.  We got hooked on the program on PBS and bought the DVDs so the kids (2 1/2 and 1 1/2 years old) could watch anytime.  My kids love it.  They dance to the music and they ask for the show by name.  After repeated viewings, the show doesn't get annoying.  The music is fun and the characters are cute.",1229212800,2,367,3.9054054054054053
3140375,5,B00153ZQSM,"We love WordWorld in our house- great quality, and my kids learn their letters- what more could you want?
As for the reviewer that doesn't like the Hopla clip- give it a chance.  Yes, Hopla is a little different, but my kids really ended up liking it.  They really get into talking to the TV and guessing the outcome of the games and different situations.",1219968000,,355,4.446153846153846
3140376,3,B00153ZQSM,"WordWorld is great, and the DVDs for my two-year-old are awesome. She says ""Woof"" when she wants to watch this DVD because Dog is so cute, and she spells along with the animated Build-A-Word sequences. The content is top-notch!

What I have a problem with is the ""Hopla"" trailers that run automatically at the end of the WordWorld disks. It's pretty sneaky to piggy back another series for toddlers at the end of a series this good. It's just an unwelcome commercial, which I shouldn't have to deal with since I *bought* the DVD. I definitely DO NOT want my daughter to watch the inane Hopla series and would never buy it. Unfortunately, the jingle is permanently stuck in my head after hearing the first few seconds three or four times in the background before I could stop the DVD.",1219881600,2,783,4.5928571428571425

3140379,5,B00153ZQSM,My 2 year old loves Word World and this is just another great DVD to add to his collection.  There are four episodes on the DVD which is listed in the product description.  My son has definitely learned his letters and sounds through watching this show.  Fantastic learning tool!  And not annoying to watch over and over again.,1395964800,,327,4.586206896551724

As a preschool teacher with a master's degree I would definitely recomend them. Watching them over and over is much better than seeing them once on a cable channel. I bought every Dvd available for Levi. Tv is mind numbing for kids unless you carefully monitor the programing.
