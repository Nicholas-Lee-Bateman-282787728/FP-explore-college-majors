7923616,4,B00004U0D4,"A new series continued on from the older series, Sol Bianca, is a action-adventure packed anime.  The space style adventures captures all the  space lovers out there.  Equiped with the latest technology, guns, missles,  the space pirates go on different missions.  One thing the new sol Bianca  series has is that it's a completely digital visual and audio presentation.  The girls have never looked sharper with character designs by Hiroyuki Ochi  who is also responsible for the look of Armitage III.
Although the  visual image is great, the background can be quite a distraction because of  the digital camera pan which gives everying a 2 dimensional look.  Overall this anime was done pretty well, and the audio is excelent.  This  series is for all age groups and I reccomend all anime fans give this anime  a try.  I'll bet the graphics will blow anyone away  =D",965520000,2,868,4.842465753424658
