4884970,5,B005SH63U6,"Love the anime great music, great character interaction with a plot that thickens and gets more epic by the episode. Only down-fall to this series is that they don't finish it.",1397174400,,176,4.709677419354839
4884971,4,B005SH63U6,"For over 400 years, it has been up to the clan of Kekkaishi, barrier masters, along with their supernatural dogs, to guard the region called Karasumori and exterminate powerful supernatural creatures, Ayakashi, that appear every night. Karasumori School just happens to be setting on that supernatural land.

Yoshimori Sumimura is an overconfident and determined 14- year old boy who attends Karasumori School. He's also the 22nd Kekkaishi of the Sumimura clan and is trained by his strict and short-tempered grandfather. Yoshimori is always competing against his older rival and crush, Tokine Yukimura. She is also a Kekkaishi, and a strict and hard-working one at that. She's known Yoshimori since childhood and even lives next door to him with her smug grandmother. Both Kekkaishi, especially their grandparents, are constantly arguing about who is the rightful heir as a barrier master.

Yoshimori's goal is to continue to work hard to become the best so he can protect the ones he cares about. But it won't be easy. The most extremely powerful Ayakashi are showing up on the Karasumori site with an evil goal in mind. Yoshimori and Tokine can't defeat them alone and have to get help from Yoshimori's older brother, Masamori, the Chief of the Night Troops. This group is an interesting bunch with unique, but burdensome powers of their own. But having the Night Troops around also causes some problems with the Kekkaishi. Will they ever learn to get along?

This is an entertaining and exciting anime. The show gets better with each episode. There are many likable characters in this interesting and creative story. There are great magical, action-packed fighting scenes, along with dramatic twists and turns and surprises as well as lots of comedy. It's a great show that will keep viewers watching. (52 episodes all together in the 4 DVD sets)",1389657600,,1850,5.078947368421052
4884972,5,B005SH63U6,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
4884973,5,B005SH63U6,This set is filled with action. The main arc isn't 100% resolved but there is still a satisfying ending to it.,1370217600,,110,4.285714285714286
4884974,4,B005SH63U6,"Great series and I wish their will be more.
Our nation is cutting back on anime and you better get them while their still there.",1369612800,,128,4.16
4884975,5,B005SH63U6,"After the death of Gen, Yoshimori is determined to become strong enough to kill Kaguro. Meanwhile, the Night Troops come to Karasumori to defend it along side Yoshimori and Tokine. The Ayakshi make one final attempt to take Karasumori. During the fight, Yoshimori allows himself to be captured. He hopes that this will give him the opportunity to fight Kaguro one last time. The thing that he didn't count on was Tokine following behind him. In Kakuboro they experience many strange, difficult, and unexpected eventualities.

This anime got better after every episode. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all the same quality as in the previous sets. This volume gives some of the back stories for all of the main Ayakashi. This makes the story a lot more interesting. This is the most intense volume in terms of violence and language. It's still pretty PG though. This is one of those rare animes that doesn't rely on fan service and violence to keep your attention. This show is completely story driven. There is plenty of action, and more drama than in the earlier episodes. That's a good thing though.

It stands to reason that if you're looking at this DVD, you've probably seen the previous episodes if not all of them. If that's the case, I'll tell you that this only gets better. I definitely recommend it to anime fans over the age of 10 or so. I really like this show, and I hope you do too.",1358121600,2,1413,4.670682730923695
4884976,5,B005SH63U6,"The whole story for this collection, I found to be very well done. It follows them from there early beginnings as children, there teen age years of how & why they need to protect the school.  They portray the young characters as just friends,but they give a nice hint that there might be more going between the two then just being friends.  I hope they follow this line of thinking. I think it will add some more twist to the story more then just leaving them as just friends.",1347148800,,476,4.337078651685394
8485024,4,B005SH63U6,"The Kekkaishi are spiritual warriors, kind of like Buddhist monk fighters.  They use special barriers, Kekkai, to trap and destroy ayakashi.  They are spiritual creatures from Japanese folklore.  These creatures aren't supposed to interact with the human world and cause damage, so the Kekkaishi vanquish them.

Its an interesting action show that starts with two completing/cooperating Kekkaishi families as young kids, skips some years, and then after a few episodes or so gets to mid-teens somewhere for the rest of the show.  The leads Yoshimori and Tokine butt heads sometimes but find unique ways to beat strong enemies as the hone their skills throughout the show.  Its a bit unique and worth the watch.

Theme Songs 3/5
The show has a solid well-fitting opening. The endings eventually cycle between a few.  They were okay.

Ending 3/5
NO spoilers, the end completed a big story arc.  It left things as basically as now lets keep on keepin on. It was fine.",1527552000,,964,4.96875
