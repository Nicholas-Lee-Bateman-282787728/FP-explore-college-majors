7076212,1,B00V3IRWJ0,Worst movie ever! Doesn't make any sense. No plot or character development. Seriously don't waste your time!,1453248000,,108,5.411764705882353
7076213,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"I was really pissed after seeing this movie. The preview is so misleading, even the synopsis on the DVD package got it wrong when it came to describing the movie. It does not even start out good. This was a kiddy film, really! Hard to believe someone expected this to make their money back, really? Save you money and your time. Oh, and if you can figure where the plot line is leading, good luck!",1452729600,,397,4.306666666666667
7076214,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"I thought Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was bad, until I saw this.  Ranks right up there with Lars and the Real Girl and American Fusion... except worse.  No plot, no objective, just lots of horrible acting.",1452297600,,207,4.5675675675675675
7076215,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"How do films like this get made?  I'm sure that I'll never know.  But somebody spent a fair amount of cash producing this nonsense.

The good: It's short?

The bad: Everything else.  There is no discernible plot of any kind.  The characters actions make absolutely no sense.  There's no exposition, no climax, no goal to achieve, and it ends as a cliffhanger.  The acting is unforgivable.  No part of the story makes the slightest attempt to follow a thread of logic.  Kids are beating up/killing adults at every preposterous turn.  The fortified camp of survivors on the planet's surface is essentially a ring of shopping carts pushed together with some cardboard for extra reinforcement.  The dialogue is embarrassing for any genre regardless of expected audience.  The special effects don't even make sense (is the ""skyark"" a few hundred feet above the ground hovering or in orbit?  You'll never know; you'll never care).  As a distraction for sitting through this dreck, I tried to think of a worse film that I've ever watched; all I could come up with was ""Ski Patrol"" ... maybe, but Ski Patrol at least had a dog that could fart on command which exceeds any of the talents in Battle for SkyArk.

The verdict:  This is not worth your time, money, or effort to make sense of.  It's simply one of the worst movies that has ever been made.  It has absolutely no redeeming virtues.  Nothing that could have been done to this film could possibly have made it worse - it is the low marker for judging movies.  Imagine the worst anime that you've ever sat through being turned into a live-action film by a group of 5 junior high school students with a handicam... that is better than this by a factor of 100.  Run away!",1436054400,19,1717,4.6158940397351
7076216,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"SPOILERS IF POSSIBLE

This is another kids save the world film. There is a Skyark where all humans reside In what amounts to shaky plot points. Some were sent back to earth which we destroyed, but apparently not fully. There are monsters or human mutants there. They are cannibals who feed off of exiled children of the rebels. We discover that Skyark is some sort of prison for all of mankind, apparently some kind of metaphor for government control/regulations. They also manufacture the monsters and put them on earth so people will want to remain in Skyark whose orbit is either in space or it hovers low in the sky, depending on the camera angle. Apparently another metaphor for government creating situations that would make the people want more government.

The film was low budget and the child acting was far from good. The lines were as confusing and ill delivered as was the plot. It appears as if they made a film from a video game where plot details are meaningless with killing obstacles and achieving a goal is the whole point.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Violence with minimum blood. Go watch ""Maze Runner"" or ""The Giver"" or something with Tom Cruise instead.",1433376000,6,1184,4.737864077669903
7076217,3,B00V3IRWJ0,"This is a kids movie, how do I know, my kids loved it.  Anytime a movie will get them off of XBOX or YOUTUBE for an hour and a half and they are quiet, mesmerized even, must be interesting for them.",1463184000,,198,3.8292682926829267
7076218,2,B00V3IRWJ0,The story was ok. The actors were ok. The backstory was weak as was the script. The film was mildly confusing about what was going on but it was so ponderous you could figure it out as you watched. The ending looks like a setup for another film which will actually be the battle for skyark.,1462665600,,290,4.196428571428571
7076219,2,B00V3IRWJ0,"okay movie, didn't like how it left you hanging.",1462579200,,48,4.444444444444445

7076221,5,B00V3IRWJ0,"Well its a low budget horror film .  What did you expect.  film quality and cutting was excellent for any film.  Yes story is weak.
but ITS A LOW BUDGET FILM .  It appears from directors info its his first film .",1459900800,,212,3.9761904761904763
7076222,1,B00V3IRWJ0,Wast of money my this video has a lame storyline and poor visual effects. It is almost as a 10 year-old kid directed and edited this video.,1459814400,,139,4.185185185185185
7076223,4,B00V3IRWJ0,fun movie for popcorn,1458345600,,21,4.5
7076224,3,B00V3IRWJ0,Just okay,1457913600,,9,4.0
7076225,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"To me ,  the best  CGI  effect in the entire movie  is the ""SKYARK "" space station  hanging above the Earth .  Either it  is hundred of miles across or in a real world it would be  falling to Earth. I purchased this Dvd just on the cover photo and after  watching it wished I had left it at the store . The oldest  actors  range from about  19  ? to middle school  age  . The major action  takes place either  in the  junk yard or  a  dark abandoned building where the  ""MONSTERS ""  live. When the Monsters can out  act the  children , well it is not a good movie .  There is better acting in any  film Bruce Campbell has ever appeared in . To me the scariest thing in the entire move is just before the credits start to roll .  They appear to be ready to make a sequel. Now that is  true Horror!",1456617600,,796,3.867088607594937

7076229,2,B00V3IRWJ0,don't waste your money or time. The girls were cute.  The story and the effects were lame. It might not be even worth two stars,1455667200,,127,4.08

7076231,1,B00V3IRWJ0,Bad acting. Terrible cgi.,1455580800,,25,5.5
7076232,4,B00V3IRWJ0,"Good, not great, movie. It center around a handful of youth and young children who are banished to a dying planet where they face ""monsters"". One is proclaimed by prophecy to lead a revolt against Skyark which is the city in the sky where everyone now lives except those banished to the planet for various offenses. Entertaining and should keep your interest. It has a couple of interesting twists.",1454976000,,398,4.782608695652174

7076237,3,B00V3IRWJ0,"This is a good beginning for a TV pilot. I'm a kid at heart, and enjoyed watching it. Yes it was bad in some places, but otherwise ok.
We need more imagination, then the cops/robbers in movies these days.",1454112000,2,204,4.256410256410256
7076238,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"Waste of time. Trying to cash in on mad max, hunger games, maze runner/ youth against evil system. Wouldn't watch it for free.",1454112000,,126,4.521739130434782
7076239,1,B00V3IRWJ0,Terrible movie,1454025600,,14,6.5
7076240,3,B00V3IRWJ0,"It was okay... Seems like they should have been a previous movie that led into this one.
Acting was mediocre... Character development was short and not involved... So when you figured out what was going on didn;t really feel for the characters.",1453852800,,244,4.833333333333333
7076241,1,B00V3IRWJ0,I can't believe how terrible this movie is it makes no sense and has no continuity whatsoever. I am only sorry the lowest rating is one star.,1453680000,,141,4.2592592592592595
7076242,1,B00V3IRWJ0,Terrible acting and special effects. The story premise was good just poorly filmed.,1453680000,,83,5.461538461538462

7076244,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"No,no,no.........don't watch this. The premise was interesting - Earth cannot support Life, so an ""ark"" is docked above to live on. But there is something sinister going on.......and that's where this falls apart. Everybody just keeps starting to do something, and then comes back. They're in trouble, then not. They are heroes, then no they're not! I watched this movie, and I don't know any more about it than before I watched it.
Hey, pass on this one.",1453507200,3,455,4.846153846153846
7076245,3,B00V3IRWJ0,"It's better than what I thought it would be. Worth watching,  but just alright.",1453507200,,79,4.642857142857143

8708998,1,B00V3IRWJ0,A terrible movie with so much potential. It made little sense and left out parts of what must have been the back story,1534118400,,118,4.173913043478261
8708999,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"This is certainly geared toward the prepubescent teenie-bopper crowd.  I'm afraid I passed that looks life marker about 45 years ago.

As someone said, it's as if someone's 12 year old niece or nephew wrote this.  Lame, lousy and crappy sum this up.",1502323200,,249,4.744186046511628
8709000,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"OMG, there is really no redeeming quality to this movie! The acting is horrific, the writing and dialog honestly sounds like something a 10 year old would write. The plot is clunky and it jumps and skips through things that you just can't ignore as creative license. There is NO battle for the SkyArk and anyway, why would any society ship its kids off to die on an abandoned planet, especially when the kids did nothing wrong?!? Wtf!!!",1484352000,,436,4.602564102564102
8709001,4,B00V3IRWJ0,The movie is good but it needs a beginning and a ending of how thing happen to the earth. But in all it is GOOD !,1479859200,,113,3.3846153846153846
8709002,2,B00V3IRWJ0,"Probably OK for early teens, but I don't recommend it for older groups",1478476800,,70,4.461538461538462
8709003,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"What? How did this make it to release???? the entire plot makes absolutely no sense the acting is just awful no no no complete waste of time, I can't believe i just lost 88 minutes of my life watching this dreck one star is being generous the one good thing I might say about this drivel is the box art which is what sucked me into watching this film,  I feel ripped off now and a little annoyed that I was tricked so easy I should have looked for reviews before hand. Bottom line Don't waste your time like I sadly have Run away from this nonsense.",1468195200,,549,4.130841121495327

8709006,1,B00V3IRWJ0,"PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE for the new generation. Really, I'd give it ZERO stars if I could. After watching it, I let a co-worker have it and I dared him to watch more than 15 minutes of it.",1464220800,,188,3.8461538461538463
8709007,4,B00V3IRWJ0,"It's  not a great movie, but fair. It's  more for early teenagers. Other for older adults. It has action, a bit of mystery, the earth in the future, is in ruins, the landscape is liter with scrap of the old world. And the last remanded of humanity live in a floating city. Called skyark. And the children of the rebels are sent to the earth. And monsters appear on the earth.",1464048000,,375,4.267605633802817
