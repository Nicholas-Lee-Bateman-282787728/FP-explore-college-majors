2471507,3,B000CRR3ME,"3 extremes is a one-off epic feature length omnibus that showcases 3 short horror films by 3 prominent directors (Takeshi Miike being the most renowned), each hailing from different Asian nations.

The series commences with 'Dumplings'; a subterranean tale that speaks of a desperate middle-aged woman's pursuit for an age-defying remedy.  Dumplings exploits the most pressing and easily offensive themes and gruesome imagery of the three shorts.  Even though Dumplings may be considered insensitive and vulgar towards its culmination, the stylized cinematography and the spine-chilling minimalist score successfully evokes a very disturbing atmosphere and the director's talent in the genre of exotic horror in undeniably unique.

'Cut', in my personal opinion, is the weakest and most tedious short by comparison.  The premise is cliched and uninteresting.  A crazed man breaks into the mansion of a rich young director who previously cast him as an extra in most of his films.  He holds the director and his wife hostage in his living room where he tortures them in a long dialogue driven showdown which quickly grows tiresome and is somewhat reminiscent of scenes in earlier American thriller and horror films with a charismatic villain, such as 'Silence of the Lambs' - but the extensive scene in Cut closely resembles 'Saw'.  The conclusion is far-fetched and offers the viewer very little in the way of explanation or exposition.  The performance of the villain is laughable which is possibly half intentional but in no way scary or provocative.

Takeshi Miike's Box would be the only short most Eastern cinema-goers would skip to first.  Box is closely linked to 'Audition' as far as style is concerned.  It is slow-paced, atmospheric and contains vague minimal dialogue.  Emphasis is placed on objects and locations which are touched upon further as the narrative progresses but much of the supposed context is left to interpretation.  Box contrasts against the other two shorts as it is a lot darker and mysterious but its ending is most odd.",1139097600,,2052,5.216463414634147
2471508,4,B000CRR3ME,"I have had this film for several months now, as I purchased it as an all-region import disc.  The film is actually an omnibus of three films, one film each directed by Takashi Miike of Japan, Fruit Chan of Hong Kong, and Park Chan-wook of South Korea.  Of the two, Miike and Park are no doubt well known here in the U.S.  This is my first exposure to the work of Chan and based on his contribution, I look forward to seeing other of his films.  The first film is ""Box,"" directed by Miike.  This is some of the most strongest, recent work done by Miike.  I thought that ""Zebraman"" was okay, and I was impressed with ""Izo"" though it did tend to be repetitive.  ""Box"" however, is visually impressive and calls to mind the work of David Lynch.  The brief running time also seems to have made for a more coherent and focused story.  I don't want to give too much away, but like Miike's best work, ""Box"" is disturbing and unforgettable.  Chan's ""Dumplings"" follows next.  Now, this film is not only disturbing, it's haunting and a bit gross.  ""Dumplings"" isn't gory though.  Let me just say that when you find out what the filling in the dumplings is, you may begin to feel a bit queasy.  There is a full-length version of this film as well, and I really would like an oppotunity to see that version.  Bai Ling is actually pretty funny in this film.  She should definitely do more overseas work.  ""Dumplings"" has probably one of the most haunting last shots you will see.  Very good film, arguably the best of the three.  The last film is ""Cut."" This is my least favorite of the three.  I've seen Park's other films and this one comes across as very light weight.  With it's excessive gore the film plays like a ""Grand Guignol.""  Park even appears to satirize his revenge trilogy.  Pay attention to the words spoken by the son of the villain of the piece.  I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.  I don't think you will be disappointed.",1137715200,10,1930,4.445714285714286

2471528,5,B000CRR3ME,"Three... Extremes lives up to its name- it's three VERY extreme horror stories that take place all across Asia.  It's stories like these that prove to me without a shadow of doubt that Asian horror is exceptionally good at atmosphere, storytelling and allowing time to develop characters correctly.

Do you like apple dumplings?  Chicken dumplings?  How about fetus dumplings?  Of course you don't like those!  The crunchy ones are apparently the tastiest and healthiest, hehe.  The first story is about a woman who meets up with a crazy cook lady who has a secret recipe in her kitchen.  When the invited woman wants a way for her skin and youth to remain intact so her husband can continue finding her desirable, well the crazy cook has just what she's looking for!  She invites the lady to take a spoonful of this sometimes slimy but always crunchy meal.  At first the woman's facial expression reveal she's a bit turned off by the crunchy mysterious dumplings, but eventually -after obtaining some vital and knowledgeable information about the long term benefits of such a delicious food- she learns to appreciate and even enjoy the taste (YUCK!)  I won't spoil much more, but this story gets really gross in a few spots (especially whenever the female cook describes in really fine detail how to properly cook fetus dumplings to make them extremely delicious).  I like the family gathering at the dinner table segment near the end.  Yes that meat smells and tastes funny for a reason!

The second story is my personal favorite.  It's about a filmmaker who once hired an extra (a guy to fill in for his movie roles) but now this extra is out for revenge.  Though his reason for taking out his aggression on the rich Asian man seem to be nothing more than jealousy because the extra himself never had the life of luxury and riches that the filmmaker has, and he even acknowledges the filmmaker is a good person which adds more to the mystery surrounding why the extra targeted this guy of all people.  The extra goes on to discuss his rough childhood in tremendous well-written detail along with his past successes in films.  The detail that went into telling this particular story is just staggeringly awesome.  The extra ties up the filmmaker to a rubbery pink rope in the living room just out of reach of his wife (who's tied to the piano seat screaming for her life).

Every 5 minutes the extra does something horrible to the wife, and it's up to her husband to somehow stop this horrific violence even though it's obvious the extra has revenge on his mind to the point he doesn't care what happens to anyone.  Sometimes the filmmaker needs to be honest about some of the choices he's made in the past much to the dislike of his tied up wife, other times he needs to entertain the extra or else more punishment will be inflicted on the wife.  That's not all- there's also the proposition that if the filmmaker would go through and kill a child that the extra kidnapped and brought over, the wife wouldn't be harmed.  What a tough situation to be in!  I honestly thought when this story started that it was leading to a really creepy ghost story since we hear the sound of the green gunky blender drink being swallowed and we then see the blender empty afterwards.  It was a trickily written segment.  The emotion, excitement, extremely graphic violence, lies and deceit, the never knowing if the filmmaker is being honest about the ""mistakes"" he's made or if he's just fed up that his wife is being tortured so he resorts to saying anything out of desperation... his attempts to actually go through and kill the child... this is the best story without question!  Just fantastic!

The third and final story takes the horror in a lighter, more atmospheric direction.  It's about a sister who accidentally and regretfully burns and apparently kills her twin sister out of jealousy while inside a circus tent doing dance and stretching tricks for the male audience, only to find herself coming back to the tent as an adult and perhaps looking for resolution only to realize that her past is coming back to haunt her in a BIG way.  The performance instructor (an adult man who I believe likes these girls in a more personal way besides just trying to bring out the best in their athletic performances based on his mannerisms) is another major character to this story as well.  This particular story leaves a lot to the viewers imagination- is her sister really dead?  Was it all a dream?  Maybe this was all part of a story the sister wrote since she is a novelist after all.  There's actually a few different parts to this story that could be interpreted as the woman's imagination running wild or perhaps it's all real and she's confronted with a tough ordeal.  I personally think everything taking place in this story is just old ghosts/inner torment haunting the woman due to tremendous guilt, hence the feeling I get that the horror we see in this story is mental torture instead of the physical torture we see in the previous story.  This one's a slow mover, but worthwhile and enjoyable.

Overall, well truthfully reading subtitles on the bottom of the screen isn't my favorite thing to do because often times I'd rather listen to the characters speak English.  Even if a bad voice actor is providing the voice work and accents that don't match up with lip movements, hey, I'd take it anyway.  This is how horror SHOULD be done though- no question about it.  All 3 stories are VERY different creatively and mentally, and the atmosphere is simply splendid since it's constantly inviting viewers to wonder what's going to happen next.  How many American horrors keep me interested?  Well there's several older ones that do, but lately it seems like I'd rather watch what the Asian countries are doing.  Great movie.",1423353600,,5822,4.705824284304048

Dumplings was, and will always be, remembered by me as something that made my boyfriend sick to watch it once he realized the special ingredient in the dumplings in question.

Dumplings seemed to be the most stomach clenching, and even that eventually felt like a flu you kept expecting to come back, as in you knew it was bad (upsetting) and knew it would return but you became used to its presence. On the whole all films were well done but not mind blowing. 3 Extreme's fails to live up to the hype it places on itself but remains a powerful film.

2471573,4,B000CRR3ME,"Overall, this is a great collection for any horror fan, especially any fan of Asian horror, mostly as it covers the range of three large countries in the Asian horror industry: China, Korea, and Japan; as well as three distinct and prominent aspects of the horror genre in general, namely shock, dark humor, and psychology.

In my opinion, Box was by far the strongest film, followed by Dumplings, and finally Cut. Perhaps that is my subjection favoring more ambiguous and cerebral psychological horror. Personally, I thought Box had an amazingly intriguing plot and near perfect cinematography and directing with a strong message. It was done in a creepy way that didn't rely on gore, shock, or cheap scares. In my opinion, this one short film is worth the price of the whole DVD. I very much wish Takashi Miike would have made it into a feature-length film as it is among his best. I would award this a 5/5.

Dumplings was great too. It succeeded as a great shock movie with an intriguing plot and a great breaking of taboos. I really enjoyed the grotesque nature of the film and found it very unique; it will certainly shock any first-time viewer. I would give this a 4/5.

Unfortunately though, I found Cut to be boring, pointless, and overall just a bad story. I doubt my opinion here is particularly biased either, for I do appreciate dark humor a lot, but nevertheless, I found little value in the story itself, and thought the message was poorly presented. Not to mention, the ending didn't really make a whole lot of sense, and not in the intricate, ambiguous kind of way characteristic of Asian horror films (e.g. Box); plainly, it didn't make any sense to me in the context of the story. I would give this film a 2/5 at best.

Overall, a great collection, with one weak film, and one amazing film. Of course, that is just my opinion based on my personal taste in horror, and many people may find their opinion differs from mine greatly. Certainly, then, buy this film; it is a must-have for any fan of horror, and any fan of Asian horror will definitely not regret it!",1325548800,2,2079,4.610810810810811

Cut: Well it was ok. I liked the plot. I am surprised how many people don't get the ending when I understand what was going on in this one perfectly. It's very linear.

Box: Getting faaaaar away from linear here. It is the most beautifully shot, but it's also the hardest to understand. I had to read spoiler reviews to actually get it.",1315008000,,584,4.398148148148148
2471575,5,B000CRR3ME,"When I first bought this film I had already knew the plot and most of what happened in each movie. But it never failed to keep my interest. The first film,'Dumplings', would have to be my second favorite of the three. I think this movie was meant to be a way for Fruit Chan to express how he feels about the Chinese policy and the way women are desperate to stay youthful even in old age. With China's one-child-to-a-home policy, abortion probably wouldn't be out of the ordinary(though Taboo to speak of) but I think what Chan was trying to say is with this film is ""If this isn't wrong, then why is this wrong? If this isn't going too far, then why is this too far? Why is this so important that you are willing to take it to the next level?""(Sorry If this is giving too much of the film away)But, I found this movie to be nicely put together and well rounded. I give this film a 4 out of 5. Can't wait to see the full length version of 'Dumplings'!
The second film, 'Cut', was the least favorite of mine, though it was entertaining and the most violent and gory of the three films. I feel that too much of the film was done in a comical way and had a lot of unnecessary elements to it. I was expecting a lot from Park but I felt that it was a great effort being his first installment into the horror genre and when all and all each film were ""different depictions of how each director thought a horror should be"". Also, like most Korean films and dramas, the ending of this film didn't fail to disappoint me. Though, I do kinda understand the ending. I think this story ended the way it did for one reason, spark of insanity. Second reason: In the end, he called his wife ""kid"" and look at the kid as though talking to his wife. I thought that since before where he had to choke the child in order for them to be free, maybe it was easier for him to kill his wife who he actually had animosity toward than an innocent child. I give this film a 3.5 out of 5.
The last film, 'Box', was my favorite. I liked the artistic element and superb direction and production value. Though slow paced, It doesn't fail to keep me interested. As Takashii mentioned in the commentary that this 48 minute film could've been told in an even shorter amount of time. While I agree, he does a great job of adding the element of surprise. Though some wouldn't classify this as a horror film, I believe it takes it a little further than just blood, knives and senseless killing and actually makes you think and feel. It blurred the line between what was a dream and was reality as you might notice at the end of the film. Also loved this film because it was, how should I say, oddly(and possibly unexceptionaly) erotic, which I loved the most. I rate this feature a 5 out of 5.
Over all, I give this film a 5 out of 5 with the exception of 'Cut'. Buy it!^_^",1306281600,,2836,4.205504587155963
2471576,4,B000CRR3ME,"An anthology of three films by noted directors of Asian horror, Three...Extremes takes us on an inventive, mesmerizing journey. Each plays with reality in a different way, asking what extremes one would go to for love, for beauty, for freedom. The middle story, ""Cut,"" is probably the weakest of the three, relying too much on accident and being too clever for its own good; the other two represent some of the best work by these directors. An interesting cross-cultural look at horror.

Three...Extremes opens with ""Dumplings,"" directed by Fruit Chan. Mrs. Li was once a famous television star, but age has made her less attractive, to audiences, and to her husband. In desperation, she seeks out a dumpling-maker, Aunt Mai, who makes the best, most expensive dumplings in all Hong Kong. They have a rejuvenating quality, she claims, and it certainly seems so; Aunt Mai looks years younger than her true age.

As she makes the dumplings for Mrs. Li, a sinister gloom descends. The knives are too loud, too sharp; the bowl of flour is dropped on the counter with a bang that makes us jump. And all along, there is a creepy, creaking sound in the background. Just what goes into these dumplings? Mrs. Li knows, for when they are served, she looks upon them with trepidation. Aunt Mai says, ""Think of the results. Not what it was."" But what is it?

The second offering of Three...Extremes, directed by Park Chanwook, is a surreal fantasy of horror. It opens with a vampires feeding off a frozen victim; the blood makes her ill, and she begins to retch. But as the camera pulls back, we realize we are on a soundstage, and nothing is real. Or is it.

For we float in and out of movieland. The director goes home, to a house that is identical to the set. He plays a cd of the score for his movie, and it becomes the score for this movie. Except one thing is out of place. There is a maintenance man in the house; the lights go out, and the director loses consciousness. When he awakes, he's back on the soundstage.

His wife is there, strung up with piano wire and chained to the piano, her fingers poised over the keys like a puppet. The maintenance man is really an extra, has been in every movie the director ever made, and still he does not recognize him. Worse yet, the director is rich and a good man--being a good man is the worst thing of all. So, the extra sets him a task; kill a little girl sitting on the couch, and he will let the director's wife go free. Fail to kill, and every five minutes, he will take one of her fingers. She is a pianist, so this is a true horror to her. Will he kill for her?

The final installment of Three...Extremes is Box, by Takashi Miike, the most mesmerizing, puzzling, and artistic of the three. Kyoko is a writer whose reality and fantasy are deeply intertwined, asleep and waking. Her story of her life is this: she and her twin sister, Shoko, were performers in a circus, contortionists in a magic act. Their master, who takes the form of the current-day Kyoko's editor, is a kindly father figure, but always gives more praise to Shoko. In a pique of jealously, Kyoko locks Shoko in one of the contortionist boxes. When an oil heater is accidentally knocked over, Shoko is trapped and the master dies trying to save her. Kyoko now lives with the guilt of wanting her sister punished, of not saving her.

In the present-day, Kyoko dreams of a relationship with that same kindly father figure, but something stops her. She can never have him, for her demons always hold her back.

But there is something strange about the whole tale. The two girls are identical to the point of being indistinguishable. Their bodies are bent and twisted into grotesque shapes to fit inside the master's boxes. Such images repeat throughout, with dolls as well as the girls. And Kyoko seems too dysfunctional to exist even as a lonely recluse writer. You won't find out just how twisted Kyoko's life is until the very end.

Together, these tales form a coherent set of stories that are as much art as they are horror, that will keep you thinking and replaying them, again and again.",1295395200,2,4106,4.545331529093369
2471577,4,B000CRR3ME,"Just like in literature, the art of short movies is tough. Plot, settings and characters need to quickly acquire depth and credibility. In ""Three Extremes"", all three directors (from Japan, Korea and Hong Kong) manage to fit in the format with original yet distinct works that differ from one another in both theme and format.

In ""Box"", the story is about ghosts -read, culpability and grieving. Horror comes in oppressive flashes and mental projections, blurring the limit between reality and dreams... er... nightmares.

In ""Cut"", horror is more ""first degree"". A couple is kept prisoner in a mysterious, modern art-like house in which a maniac threatens to cut off the spouse's fingers one by one unless the husband agrees to do what's required, no questions asked... The movie's about setting personal values straight once and for all.

In ""Dumplings"" -my favourite, for its acute relevance with today's societal issues- a beautiful yet vain executive woman is doing whatever she can to preserve her beauty and youth to maintain the grasp on her husband. She calls upon a mysterious lady whose magical dumplings are said to have just such properties. But there is a price to pay to preserve beauty and youth. Dumplings is in the end about the uphill battle against age... with its cohort of other attributes such as selfishness and vanity. Top notch...

BOX (Japan, directed by Miike Takashi)- A woman is haunted by nightmares of her twin sister. Many eerie and ghoulish goings-on. Much of the film is dreamlike, giving a sense of unreality. A great ending helps this one! 3 EXTREMES is an excellent anthology for lovers of Asian horror, or horror in general. Well worth owning... P.S.- The 2-disc edition has the full-length feature version of DUMPLINGS. Highly recommended as it fleshes out the story, as well as providing a more thorough narrative...",1282435200,11,983,5.15

The trio was created in three different countries - Japan, China and Korea. Each are subtitled in English and the video quality is excellent. The first feature... is called ""Dumplings"" (It gets all 5 stars). The second is ""Cut"" (It, too, gets all 5 stars). The third is ""Box"" (It gets all 5, plus an extra one). I just bought the sequel (Part 2) and will watch them in the next week or so. This set was made for the true fans of chilling horror...like me. Highly recommended.  And, not to put down other reviewers, these flicks are quite extreme...maybe not as graphic as some would like, but there's plenty of blood, pain and emotional frenzies...just the way horror should be delivered.  For the price, you're getting THREE top notch horror movies.  Wait till after dark to watch this...around dinner time.  It's a great three-course meal.",1281139200,,999,4.858823529411764

  This movie did not frighten me in the least. It was so painfully obvious in the first story what the dumplings are that it kind of ruins the entire thing. The second one has many social connotations I am sure but that really isn't my thing.
  I found the third story to be creepy in some parts but at the end I guess I just didn't understand what had happened. I don't consider myself to some movie genius like many of the reviewers here but I usually am able to understand...this just kind of jumped to what they thought might be a creepy ending but made very little sense.

2471594,1,B000CRR3ME,"I barely made it through this dvd and when it was over I rolled my eyes and shelved it.  The trilogy of films on this dvd are just plain silly.  ""Dumplings"" is ridiculous.  It's a story about a fetus-munching woman.  The slow, deliberate 'crunch, crunch, crunching' of fetal bone is over emphasized and almost comic.  The second story has the usual twitchy Asian lunatic torturing and punishing.  And the third story is forgettable.

Please do not waste your money or your time on this DVD.  If you want to watch truly incredible Asian films, I recommend A Tale of Two Sisters, OldBoy, Dark Water and The Eye 1 and 2.  If you want to watch a movie with truly vile moments in it, watch Audition.  If the sight of a lovely young woman vomitting into a dog dish and feeding it to a starving man she keeps tied up in a burlap sack doesn't make you queasy, I don't know what will.  And that's just ONE of the nauseating scenes in Audition.  Don't watch it if you have a weak stomach.  Seriously.

3 Extremes II and III are mostly boring with little or no shock value, with the exception of the story ""Going Home"" which is on 3 Extremes II.  It stars the incredible Eugenia Yuan (Memoires of a Geisha, The Eye 2) and is a complex and bittersweet story.  If you want to purchase one of the 3 Extremes movies, I recommend 3 Extremes II because of ""Going Home"".  As for 3 Extremes III, I was not scared, disgusted, or moved in any way by this dvd.  I am amazed at some of the other reviews that give this DVD a 5 star rating and comment on how horrible and frightening the 3 stories are.  Guess those reviewers haven't watched OldBoy or Audition.

2471595,1,B000CRR3ME,"These three movies are supposed to be like Asian ""Twilight Zone"" episodes but were just three very bloody disturbing movies.  The first was Chinese and was about the extremes to which a woman would go to remain young and beautiful...(the secret's in the dumplings).  It was actually well made but just plain gross.  The second story was Korean and was about a young rich director (who happens to be a really nice guy) who is kidnapped by a man who tortures the director's wife in order to get the young man to confess to a sin.  There must be some Korean philosophy here that doesn't really translate to the West ---that a rich man cannot be a good man...so if good man is rich, then he must be lying and hiding an awful secret.  I didn't get it, but it was extremely violent and bloody and in my opinion had no point to it.  The third story is Japanese and is about a woman who lives with the guilt that as a child she unintentionally caused the death of another little girl whom she was jealous of.  It was a beautifully made movie and had a couple of eerie scenes in it, but there was absolutely no point to it.  It was disturbing because the adult trainer of the girls (they were acrobats) seemed to be sleeping with the little girl he favored and gave her a necklace...but it seemed to imply that the other girl was jealous because she wanted the same 'attention' from the man (as well as a necklace).  There was of course a twist at the end, but it made no sense.  This DVD was a BIG waste of time and money!

2471596,3,B000CRR3ME,"One thing about the horror genre is that it is so difficult to define.

Viewers expecting supernatural ghost stories or vampires and werewolves might be disappointed with ""Three...Extremes."" What any good horror film does however, is hit (or sometimes pound) on a key that deeply disturbs us inside.

Three...Extremes is one such film and is comprised of three shorter films, the best of which being Dumplings (Fruit Chan). Though utterly disgusting and hard to watch, it is done right, for it does not rely on gore alone. Rather, it delves into the human psyche and exposes a darker side of humanity-- thoughts and perversions we'd rather not think about. To what length will one go to obtain what she thinks she wants?

The other two mini-films, although not as good as ""Dumplings,"" are decent. ""Cut"" would draw comparisons to ""Hard Candy,"" and perhaps ""Saw."" The third mini-film (Miike), entitled ""Box,"" is somewhat unique, perhaps too abstract to be truly chilling.",1184803200,,969,5.04375
2471597,3,B000CRR3ME,"*3 Extremes* is an anthology of 3 Asian directors giving a short film.

The first one was ""Dumpling"" and I thought this was the most gruesome of them all.  Let me forewarn you not to eat, especially Chinese food, while watching this particular short because that is exactly what I did.  I had to put down my food until this movie was over.

Anyways, ""Dumpling"" is about a woman who is known for her dumplings that seem to bring restorative powers of youth.  An aging actress has sought out this woman for the dumplings.  Over time, she starts to notice that she gets a little younger.  Of course, there is a price attached for wanting to become younger.

""Cut"" was ok.  It was the least favorite of mine.  Maybe I overanalyze this one but I felt that the ending ruined the whole point of the movie.  Anyways, a movie director is captured and imprisoned in his own set that he was currently filming.  On his right is his wife who is ""stringed"" to a piano.  On his left is a bound and gagged girl.  The kidnapper is deranged and wants a confession out of the director and wants him to strangle the girl to death.  For every 5 minutes that passes and the girl isn't strangled, the wife loses a finger.

This one is sort of like watching ""Tales from the Crypt"" because something goes awry towards the end.

""Box"" was interesting.  A woman gets this strange recurring dream and then she gets a visit from her dead sister.  Then, you're taken back to the time when the woman and her sisters were little girls.  They were acrobatic dancers for a man at a one-tent circus.

One evening, a girl decides to tease her sister by locking her in a box.  When that is done, an argument ensues between the girl and the man.  During the argument, a fire breaks out and quickly engulfs the box with the trapped sister.  The man jumps into the fire but he never makes it back.  The girl runs away, never looking back.

Years later, the woman is having dreams about her past.  Plus, someone is sending her reminders of the past.  If you really pay attention, you can probably figure it out before the ending is revealed.

Overall, I thought this film was alright.  Nothing really scary or suspenseful.  Just gruesome...with ""Dumpling"".  I was telling a friend of mine about this.  He told me there is an extended/completed version of ""Dumpling"".  So, I'm curious to check that out.",1181520000,,2361,4.477647058823529
2471598,3,B000CRR3ME,"You know how it is with anthologies - they're always hit and/or miss, even when you get top directors.  This one really has good names.  I was wary of this film when I learned two of the three directors were Park Chan-wook and Takashi Miike.  I saw their previous movies and they freaked me out.  Miike, especially, really traumatised me with ""Ichi the Killer"". All three mini-movies are beautifully shot and there are hints the directors really are trying to be extreme but trying doesn't mean that they are. It was really surprising that non-horror director, Fruit Chan, is the one who comes closest. His ""Dumplings"" - a tale of abortion, cannibalism, dumplings and beauty supplements - is the only one truly worthy of the price of admission.  It's uncomfortable, disturbing and macabre, all the more by relying on suggestion and being relatively gore-free. Ironically, Park's and Miike's segments are the weaker ones. Park's entry, ""Cut"" is silly psychobabble nonsense while Miike's ""Box"" is too bizarre and incoherent to be horrifying. There's a lot of fluids,body parts and mad people but that only makes it icky, not extreme.",1179964800,,1131,4.99468085106383

2471620,5,B000CRR3ME,"""Three Extremes"" is a 126-minute tour-de-force of horror, intensity, and striking visual imagery, composed of three mid-length tales from Asia.  Each segment hails from a different country, a theme that's becoming a bit of a trend in Asian anthologies and that I wouldn't mind seeing continue, possibly expanding in the future to offer more anthology segments originating from the more 'undiscovered' (in terms of their movies making it to an international audience) countries like The Phillipines and Malaysia.

  The first tale, the Hong Kong Extreme entitled ""Dumplings"", is about a woman who prepares 'special' little pastries with seemingly miraculous health benefits, and the secret ingredient that gives them their potency.  Included in an alternate, much longer form on the second disc in the package, the gruesome ""Dumplings"" creeps across some of the most disconcerting territory imaginable.  The nature of the dumplings's unique ingredient is revealed early in the tale and with virtualy no buildup, and could have been even more shocking if the segment had been structured so as to bring out the revelation closer to its conclusion.  As it is though, it guarantees a constant state of very unsettling discomfort throughout, and allows the piece to act as a kind of social commentary.

  The Korean Extreme - ""Cut"" (also known as ""Peach"") is in more traditional horror thriller territory, but taken to more of an extreme (no pun intended) and put together with tremendous flair.  It's about a movie director and his wife taken captive in their own home by a psychopath, and it excels in both psychological and visual aspects.  It does more with sights and cinematography than you'd think a piece taking place almost entirely in a large apartment could.  The wire trap has a strangely beautiful symmetry whose asethic effect is strikingly at odds with its purpose.  Unpredictable from the start, ""Cut"" gets Very strange at the end, with a weirdly cryptic last few minutes.

  The Japanese Extreme, ""Box"", is a major mystery, and for most of its length you don't know what exactly is going on, except that it deals with an emotionally troubled woman and memories of a very sinister box.  To say too much of what it's about would kind of be a disservice, because it's better to let it unfold and reveal its subject matter in its own time.  Perhaps the most outstandingly produced of the three segments - which is saying something - ""Box"" is haunting in every way.  For much of the segment it's almost a silent piece, with only occasional, subtle sounds.  The use of color in the outdoors winter scenes is extraordinary, giving ""Box"" a wonderfully ghostly feel.  This tale is directed by Miike Takashi, and at times its overall style is reminiscent of his brilliant and legendary ""Audition"".

  Taken together the combination of the three tales gives an unusually intense and rather intimidating experience.  An excellent whole.",1178409600,,2935,5.0625
2471621,3,B000CRR3ME,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer ... unless you are an ardent fan of Asian horror, I'd begin my collection elsewhere.

""Dumplings"" is well cast. Both actresses engage the viewer fully. And, by all means, the topic is deeply taboo and evokes a visceral response. (I'm willing to bet the crunching of baby-bones  has caused more than one viewer to swoon). And the conclusion, well, it was a good as could be expected ... perhaps even better. (Though the tongue thing has me at a bit of a loss). The eye-contact with the viewer in the final seconds is smart ... as if to say, ""Would you do anything different for beauty?"" I guess, I just wish Fruit Chan had made this a full-length film! 4 out of 5 stars.

""Cut"" has a thoroughly post-modern spin. It is clever and visually stunning. It is, a bit predictable; however, the director's ""playfulness"" easily compensates for the obviousness of the film-short. I really enjoyed the cyclical nature of the piece. It is uncanny, to say the least. Technically speaking, it is a 4 out of 5. As far as story-telling is concerned, a 2 out of 5.

""Box"" was the most disappointing. I am a huge Takashi Miike fan (""Audition"" and ""Happiness of the Katakuris"" are two of my most beloved Asian films!) Still, even he could not work his usual magic on this unpredictably ""predictable"" piece (as in, when it concludes you are like, ""Ummmmm, really?! How painfully 'Twilight Zone'!!"") (And, yes, the director is quite familiar with Western works). Why this piece may interest fans of the director is his treatment of women. Much like ""Audition,"" the viewer encounters a young woman who (seems to) have endured a strange, unpleasant childhood. It haunts her adult years. Only, there is a wretched spin at the very end (which you may or may not find amusing. You be the judge). Visually, the short film is a 4 out of 5. The story 1 out of 5.

So, if you are a fan of the genre, definitely watch it. There are many gratifying moments for enthusiasts! But, if this is one of your first forays into Asian horror, return to this collection once you have a firmer foundation. (I'm not insinuating that you will fail to understand this collection ... I think anyone can understand these film-shorts ... I am just afraid that they will not make the best impression with you!) Try ""Audition,"" ""Ichi the Killer,"" or even ""The Eye"" and then return to this one.",1174780800,,2385,4.589201877934272
2471622,2,B000CRR3ME,"I was not familiar with Fruit Chan prior to seeing this but was excited to see both Takashi Miike and Chan-Wook Park in a single film. Well, the idea was way better than the result.

""Dumplings"" is quite genuinely disturbing actually, so perhaps I should be more complimentary towards it but I found it too annoying and offputting in its precious style to really like it; so I guess I have a certain cerebral admiration for this episode but I just wouldn't particularly want to go through it again.  Chan-Wook Park's episode ""Cut"" was a startling disappointment to me.  It was so completely deranged and aggressively over the top (and not in the good way) as to almost make me question my love of his other work.  It had that kind of highly theatrical exaggerated formal gimmickry that a lot of very tough to sit through late 60s/early 70s ""ART"" films have (especially fellini inspired trippy movies about movie-making); a kind of frenetic jumbling of avant-gardisms and artificiality that can just push you away from the screen and make you recoil.  While Oldboy, say, has its excessive attention-drawing formalistic elements, they never pile up and become distracting or egregious; maybe this short film was intended by Park as a kind of extended joke about criticisms made of his other films but I can't really tell for sure.  I prefer to tell myself that ""Cut"" just does not exist and will continue to think of Chan-Wook Park as a director that I like.  Miike's installment, coming after Park's is strangely quite subdued and has a sort of dreamy Lynchian feel a bit like Gozu did. While I thought there were some nice moments to it and some striking visuals, it's really not all that essential to see in the rather complicated Miike-landscape.

So, I can't really see much reason to recommend getting this.  I'm not even sure if I could recommend a single viewing, given that I somewhat regret having seen ""Cut"" at all and given that ""Dumpling"" is so fundamentally unpleasant in nature.  But then, perhaps, my reaction to those two installments should say something about what true ""horror"" is really about (?) and maybe there is more to this omnibus venture than I am willing to admit. If true ""horror"" is about feeling repulsed and unhappy, then maybe these two segments really nailed it in fact, but I tend to think it's not as simple as that and so easy.",1173571200,,2363,4.7274939172749395
2471623,5,B000CRR3ME,"`3 Extremes' combines three short (about 40 minutes each) films, `Dumplings' by the Chinese director, Fruit Chan, `Cut' by the Korean director, Park Chan-Wook, and `Box' by the Japanese director, Miike Takashi. What makes them so amazingly good is that they rely on neither supernatural agents, extreme monsters (can we say `not another `Godzilla' send-off, please), or excessive and elaborate pain-inflicting gadgets (can we say please no `Saw 4' or another `Texas Chain Saw Massacre', please). Oddly, this makes them strongly akin to some of Stephen King's best horror stories, even though King does rely on the supernatural a fair bit (especially in his best, such as `Carrie', `The Stand', and `The Shining'), he does it with such attention to the ordinary, you hardly notice the spooks in the house.

One thing in common with two of the three, `Box' and `Cut', is that the filmmaker introduces extreme circumstances, and makes them easy to believe (and therefore be all the more scary) by showing them as part of either a dream or a staged event. Chan takes things even further and may be the most successful of the three in that the horrific device is so unusual, it comes as a genuine surprise. In fact, the story of `Dumplings' before Chan lets the cat out of the bag appears so benign, it almost seems like a segment from that great Japanese foodie movie, `Tampopo'. Even the soft core pornographic scenes are entirely consistent with many of the scenes from `Tampopo'.

Of the three, `Cut' is the most visually violent, and yet this violence is quite restrained when compared to the `Saw' flicks, `...Chainsaw...', or `Hostel'. The violence and style of restraint is almost mannerist, and definitely sedate when compared to these American bloodfests.

All three films are in their original languages with English subtitles. Only the third film, `Box' has a director's voice-over commentary, and I didn't feel this added much to what I got out of the movie; however, it was a worthwhile reason to watch the piece a second time. I strongly agree with the director that when you watch this piece, do it without the commentary turned on first, since such an important aspect of the film is the ABSENCE of sound and dialogue.

This collection is eminently successful, in that it has definitely encouraged me to see the other films made by these three directors, and to be quick about it. If they can do this good a job with 40 minutes, I am anxious to see what they can do with 90 to 120 minutes!

Of course, Asian filmmaking and actors have a style all their own, and it is NOT the style of Akira Kurasawa and his Samurai film copycats. It is far more like Kabuki or `No' dramas, very heavily mannerist, almost like classical ballet. But, this detracts not one wit from the excellence of these pieces.",1172534400,,2807,4.791322314049586
2471624,4,B000CRR3ME,"This is the perfect jumping-off point
for anyone curious about diving into Asian Shock Cinema.
It contains 3 Extreme Tales,
that encompass the brunt of what Asia has to offer.

For those interested in creepy gross-out fests;
Fruit Chan's ""Dumplings"" will deliver.
For those interested in tales of vengeance;
Chan Wook-Park's ""Cut"" will leave you in pieces.
And for those seeking a ghost story;
Takashi Miike's ""The Box"" will haunt you.

I personally ordered this flick twice from Amazon;
- once for myself
- and once for a friend of mine who also loves Eastern Horror

To both my suprise and delight, this is a 2-disc set
The second disc containing the full version of ""Dumplings"",
which quite honestly, is worth the purchase alone.

Anyways ... on to the movies:

Fruit Chan's ""Dumplings""
is easily the most extreme of the 3.
It tells the tale of a woman, whose Home-made Dumplings can restore the youth of anyone who can afford them.
Subsequently, she also runs a clinic out of the back of her shop, where she aquires her youthful ingredients.
Needless to say:
This one is not for The Feint of Heart or Weak of Stomach.

Chan Wook Park's ""Cut""
is the most intense of of the 3 Extremes.
More than once it had me on the edge of my futon.
Another tale of of retribution, from the man who masters in the subject.
This tale concerns a POMPOUS director,
who is kidnapped by a demented extra he once employed.
Tied up with a giant rubber-band, that allows for minimum movement,
he must make the most dire decision of his life.
Is he willing to take the life of a little girl to save his wifes?

Takashi Miike's ""The Box""
is the most artistic of the 3,
yet sadly, it's the least extreme.
For those who know his work, you will be thoroughly disappointed.
For those who don't know his work (good for you, you may enjoy this)
he is the most extreme of the extreme.
So Extreme ""Showtime"" wouldn't air his episode of ""Masters of Horror"" due to graphic content.
(Interesting Side Note:
""Showtime does however play ""Ichi the Killer"" & ""Gozu"" - Go Figure)
Anyway he's a cult favorite in both America and his native Japan.
The guy practically screams ""extreme"" from hemisphere to hemisphere,
so naturally, he seemed like a shoe-in for this project.
Regretfully though, his installment is totally not ""Miike""
But since you don't know of his work, it should be fine.
Whatever the case may be....
This ghost tale revolves around 2 Sisters (Sound Familiar?)
Both of whom fall in love with their dance instructor.
The one sister becomes jealous when she finds the other is intimately involved with the trainer, so naturally she locks her sister in a box to keep her safe. (Sounds Rational)
- Loads of artsy atmosphere, gorgeous settings, and enough chills to keep you on ice; but ulimately none of that could save me from the impending confusion, and dare-I-say, boredom that ensued.
- Maybe if you've never seen a ""Miike"" film before you'll enjoy this one, or maybe if you still like ""Ringu"" you'll get a kick out of it.
But for me..........

Dumplings is one movie that made me want to actually throw up. Pretty sick and twisted. The full-length feature film is where it's at though. I don't really think you can grasp the entire story in only 40 minutes, so I'm glad they released this with the DVD.

Cut simply blew me away! In this movie, you never know what's going to happen next. Just simply brilliant! Chan-wook Park did such an amazing job with this movie, I'm actually looking forward to seeing more from him.

I was pretty dissapointed with Box. I actually had expected alot from Takashi Miike, but unfortunately I was let down. Probably the worst of the three and I could probably go on with the rest of my life without seeing it again. Creepy at times, but just doesn't deserve to be in this film.

Mike takashi is just an amazing director however, Fruit chan definitely had one up on him in this trilogy. For the die hard J-horror fans definitely pick this one up it outdoes the Grudge and the Ring in my opinion. More unique story lines instead of the same old stuff america keeps stealing from Japan. If you can't afford to buy both blockbuster video is now selling them each for 9.99 used. Definitely check it out.

The full length version of Dumplings has so much more information in it, but regardless the short version of Dumplings in the Extremes isn't that bad, it just leaves alot out.  So if I were you and wanted some beautiful creepy culture I'd buy this for Dumplings and Box.  Box is a movie I'm still trying to get, because the end is a conclusion that you can take in two different ways.  But keep in mind Box is as enjoyable as Dumplings.

If you're not, well, don't buy/watch it, because this trilogy is incredibly cruel and unrelenting. It plays as a single feature divided into three sections: ""Dumplings"", directed by Fruit Chan of Hong Kong, ""Cut"" directed by Park Chan-Wook of Korea and ""Box"" directed by Miike Takashi of Japan. Each section is like a dissertation in horror, although ""Dumplings"" could also be classified as an exploitation film.

All of them are beautifully produced and directed, and I especially found ""Box"" to be quite lavish in sets, costumes and atmosphere. They each show a lot about the culture of the respective countries they were made in and also provide new takes on the terrifying and the appalling. They are each original in their own right, although ""Cut"" could be compared to the ""Saw"" or Hannibal Lecter franchises in that there's a psycho who's trying to get a message across by way of murder and mayhem.

I don't want to give away details on the plots of any of them because I think that viewers need to experience them for themselves with no preconceptions going in, but what I can say is that ""Dumplings"" has the most plot and is probably the one with the highest ""squeam"" factor, ""Cut"" covers a rather familiar premise but with lots of fun moments (you'll see) and ""Box"" is more of an artistic endeavour with not much of a plot, but for some reason I was enthralled and couldn't look away; it's the one I liked the most.

This segment takes turn for the wierd in an almost Twilight zone fashion  when one of the twins gets trapped in the box and is set ablaze. the rest is even stanger than that.

2471673,2,B000CRR3ME,"Bad news from the Eastern front!

If this dull little horror anthology is the most extreme terror our three Asian Masters---Takashi Miike, Park Chan-Wook, and relative newcomer Fruit Chan---can cook up, then I'm afraid the J-Horror cauldron is sorely in need of some spice.

I really *wanted* to like ""Three Extremes"", which made the anthology's bumpy mediocrity sting all the worse. Maybe it was high expectations, maybe it was a few bad tuna rolls earlier in the day, but this little outting left me bored, bummed, and with a sour taste in my mouth, to boot.

Episode 1 is ""Dumplings"" by Fruit Chan, which takes the dubious distinction as having been the only anti-abortion horror flick I've ever seen.

Chan proves he has a knack for direction and a few moody, creepy shots, but the guy knows nothing about setting up what should have been a surefire Chinese pot-sticker of Grand Guignol ghoulishness. I mean, for Lolth's sake, it's about a chick who decides to roll back the years by chomping down on crispy aborted foetuses.

No joke, crispy aborted foetuses.

Fruit Chan might want to take his talents on the road to the increasingly popular food-TV circuit, since he manages to make the little tender vittles (with finges and hands and toes, and crunchy little craniums!) look yummy.

Anyway, talk about Pro-Choice: the only choice here is between having the little buggers sauteed in blood broth or served up pan-seared. Equally tasty is luscious little Ling Bai (Auntie Mei), who does hard duty as a kind of East End (wayyyyy East End) version of Sweeney Todd's Missus Lovatt, who midwifes her little tasties out of the uterus and right into the kettle, and with a little culinary legerdemain into her yummy, chewable meat-pies. Ling Bai can cook my dumplings any day.

Next up is Chan-wook Park's balefully dull ""Cut"", the tale of a director (Byung-Hun Lee, who looks for all the world like an Asian version of McCauley Culkin all-growed up) caught up in an orgy of vengeance orchestrated by an astonishingly unmotivated stage extra (Won-hie Lim, whose purring, nasty lisp is the scariest thing in the flick).

There are a few truly delicious moments here that kept my finger off the FFWD button: the Director's wife lashed to her grand piano by a spiderweb array of catgut and piano-wire, her face a wild tomcat Kabuki-mask of tears and ruined mascara. Or the Trap itself, carried out on a studio set identical to the Director's house, a set whose garish colors and peculiar angles call to mind the nightmare landscapes of Dario Argento.

Oh, and there's the jolly spectacle of the Director himself, lashed within his little labyrinth by a bungee chord. Haven't seen *that* before.

But Park does nothing with it: nothing that hasn't been done a zillion times before by the most conventionally commercial American serial killer flicks. ""Hannibal"", at least, for all its tedium, at last got the blood up: ""Cut"", by contrast, just drones on and on until it wheezes out beneath its deadly dull weight.

And then there's Miike's ""Box"", arguably the best of the pitiful bunch. Like the rest, you've seen it all done before, and done better: it's the tale of a travelling circus performer and his two twin daughtes, who strut their stuff on the boards as adorable (if spooky) little contortiontists and have an, erm---complicated---relationship with Daddums. One gets jealous, something nasty happens, and the rest of the show is all about tying up loose ends, so to speak.

Miike is a deranged genius, but here he underplays it: the shock scenes are filmed at a distance, so the effect is muted. That actually works to ""Box""'s advantage, though, in that the horror is almost sublime, and for that reason all the more effective.

It's a nice touch---and a testament to Miike's self-confidence---that he didn't go in for the kill with a close-up on the nasty, matted, red-gooey horror that peers out of the box for an instant: that marvellous little moment alone merits this otherwise dismal collection its two stars.

In the end, though, ""Extremes"" loses out because it's just not all that extreme. The weirdness level is about 20 gauges below that of David Lynch, the gore (crispy fetuses notwithstanding) is set on LOW, and the terror-factor is pretty much non-existent.

The real shock is the number of missed opportunities---what about using all that catgut to slice big bloody chunks out of the Director's wife in ""Cut"", rather than riding the rails to Dullsville by just chopping her fingers off? What about having one of those baby dumplings wriggle around before dinner, maybe turning one of its malformed little black shark-eyes up to its wilfully vain diner?

Nothing that cool happens, and that's what's wrong with ""Extremes.""

Three extremes? Nah---try Three Stooges. Pass.

Miike's ""Box"" is the best of the bunch, a surreal psychological portrait of guilt with a startling image at the end.  Chan's ""Dumplings"" is an obvious, simplistic morality play with an ending I could see from a mile away.  (I wonder if it plays better for Chinese speakers.  It occured to me that this segment could function as a commentary on China's ""one child"" policy, but this is not evident from the subtitles.)

Now this short is not for the weak at heart and I think some folks just will not make it thru this bad boy. I loved ever sick minute of it and think the presentation can not be beat, from acting, sets, effects to directing it is flawless in my eyes.

The third story is a little bit of a let down to me and the suspension of disbelief just was not there for me. The acting, camera work and sets are grade A and it is be no means a waste of time, it's just so hard to hold a candle to the first to stunners.

2471676,4,B000CRR3ME,"Three...Extremes (Fruit Chan/Chan-wook Park, and Takashi Miike, 2005)

Take three already well-proven Asian directors forty minutes each and you're liable to wind up with the best thing since the Chinese buffet made it to American shores. It's also likely to be a bit inconsistent, but that's probably going to be a minor concern.

Three...Extremes fits the bill in both cases. Three stories, one directed by each of three of Asia's most respected directors. Fruit Chan weighs in with Dumplings, Chan-Wook Park with Cut, and Takashi Miike with Box. All three are interesting and engaging, though not all of the directors really brought their A game.

Dumplings is a horrific little tale of a woman (Love and the City's Meme Tian) who senses that she's losing her husband (The Lover's Tony Leung) as she grows older, and will do anything to regain her youth. Cut is the story of a jealous actor (Won-hie Lim, recently of Funny Movie) who kidnaps a good-hearted film director (Everybody Has a Little Secret's Byung-Hun Lee) and tries to find ways to corrupt him. Box introduces us to Kyoko (TV actress Kyoko Hasegawa), a young, successful novelist whose twin sister Shoko (Yu Suzuki, in her film debut) and their guardian died in a tragic fire when the girls were adolescent, who is now being visited by Shoko's ghost.

Fruit Chan turns in the real winner here. Dumplings is just about perfect in every way. Well-acted, well-plotted, and most importantly, it fits perfectly in its time slot; forty minutes gives you just what you need to be satisfied with the tale. The same can be said of Cut, but its ending, while undeniably powerful, falls apart somewhat. There's a fine line between ambiguous and confusing, and Park goes a little too far over it. Box, on the other hand, ultimately comes off like a Reader's Digest Condensed Edition; you know there's a lot more to this story, and the bare bones end up unsatisfying. While the film is probably the best of the three technically, and the acting, script, and direction are all up to Miike standards, it seems as if pieces are missing-- those little details, the seemingly insignificant scenes, that make a Miike film truly great. The end result is proficient but unsatisfying.

Three...Extremes is worth it for Dumplings alone. The other two are just icing on the cake. *** ",1153267200,,2326,4.875949367088608
2471677,4,B000CRR3ME,"I actually sat down to watch this DVD without knowing that it was a trilogy of horror tales, so it was a bit of a surprise to see the credits for the first segment start rolling and to have watched the climax of that first story without knowing it was the conclusion.  But the description of the movie that came with the disc only talked about the first story and helped perpetuate my error.  In point of fact, ""Three Extremes"" (""Saam gaang yi"") is a trilogy of horror stories from three Asian directors from three different countries.  This might not be everybody's cup of tea, especially when it comes to their taste in horror, but this certainly is an improvement over most of the horror anthologies we had to endure during the 1960s and 1970s.  What you need to know is that it going beyond what we have seen in the past, some viewers will find this film goes too far.

The short that will push limits and buttons alike is the first one, ""Dumplings,"" directed by Hong Kong's Fruit Chan.  It takes a familiar theme in horror shows, the desire of a woman to maintain her looks and youth.  Ching (Miriam Yeung Chin Wah) was a television star and while we would think she is still attractive, she is no longer working and has no doubt it is because she is losing her looks.  So she seeks out Mei (Ling Bai) who makes dumplings in her crowded apartment and who maintains they are the secret to her own youthful appearance, because she claims to be a whole lot older.  So Ching tries the dumplings, and, damn is they do not appear to be working.  That means more dumplings, but the process is too slow for Ching and she is willing to try something more drastic, so Mei says she will see what she can do.  Now I could let you know more about what else Mei does in her little apartment and what he secret ingredient turns out to be, but it might shock you, offend you, and possibly make you physically ill.  But, hey, that is what peole WANT in a horror film, right?  In that regard Fruit Chan comes up with a situation that will truly horrify you and a final scene that could well make you close your eyes and vow never to take a bath as long as you live.  You will not forget this one and you might not forgive the director.

Next up is ""Cut,"" by the Korean director Chan-Woo Park (""Oldboy"").  A director (Byung-hun Lee) of horror films wakes up on his set to discover that his wife (Hye-jeong Kang), a pianist has her fingers super-glued to the keys of a piano.  On the couch sits a young child who has been bound and gagged, while the director finds himself at the end of a tether that restricts his movements as to what he can and cannot reach.  This strange situation has been created by a stranger (Won-hie Lim), who has appeared in all five of the director's films, and hates the director because he is everything the stranger is not.  The stranger's goal is to bring the director down to his level by forcing the man to do something evil.  Again, telling you what he want the director to do would be giving away too much of what happens, but the multiple meanings of the title given the circumstances will point you in the right direction.  Suffice it to say that things get bloody, a lot bloodier than the first story, and even then it is not over.

Finally, there is ""Box,"" from the Japanese director Takashi Miike (""Audition"").  Given his track record (the ""Dead or Alive"" trilogy), the biggest surprise on this DVD might well be the restraint and almost surreal approach he takes in telling this tale, because after the first two I was not sure what sort of horror show was being saved for last.  The story is about a novelist, Kyoko (Kyoko Hasegawa), who is having nightmares about what we assume is her past.  Once upon a time there were twin girls, Kyoko (Mai Suzuki) and Shoko (Yuu Suzuki), who worked in a sort of magic act with their stepfather (Atsuro Watabe).  The girls were contortionists, who would fold themselves into small boxes.  Darts are thrown at the boxes to make them spring open and reveal flowers where the girls had been.  But the stepfather, who cares more for Shoko, albeit in clearly disturbing and ominous ways, makes young Kyoko jealous.  So she comes up with what may or may not be a bit of childlike payback that has fatal results.  Now as an adult, Kyoko is not only having recurring nightmares, but she has also received a letter telling her to return to the circus for a reunion.  The ambiguity of the situation, where she could be just dreaming or totally insane, is hardly resolved by the ending of this one.

I have discovered two interesting things about ""Thee Extremes"" now that I have actually watched the film.  First, ""Dumplings"" was originally a complete film on its own that has been cut down to less than half its original length for this exported version.  Second, Lions Gate changed the order of the segments for the U.S. version.  Originally it was ""Box,"" and then ""Dumplings"" followed by ""Cut.""  That would certainly make a difference to viewers.  I have to say that starting with the least offensive tale rather than the one that could compel viewers to hit the eject button on their DVD players is an interesting tactic to take.  But I take some small measure of comfort in noting how many people knowing full well that the opening segment could be too much for some viewers still refrain from letting the cat out of the bag and allowing others to make up their own minds.",1151625600,4,5431,4.4539939332659255
2471678,5,B000CRR3ME,"so, this review is for 3-Extremes, which in actuality, as all the neurotic fanboys have pointed out, is the 2nd volumne in the series.

""Dumplings"" by Fruit Chan:

To start things off we have the shortened version of Fruit Chan's ""Dumplings"".  The twist, which in this day and age might seem a bit trite, is still incredibly effective in it's portrayal of the levels of desperation people, be they men or women, in this case a woman, will sink in order to achieve eternal beauty.  The scene where Bai Ling is retrieving and eventually chopping up the main ingredient to her prized dumplings is disturbing, and I have seen some sick, depraved things in films before.

Rating: 5 out of 5

""Cut"" by Park Chan-Wook:

""Oldboy"" director Chan-Wook Park serves us up a piece of symbolic dreamlike horror with his installment.  I think, from the other reviews I've read, that this segment gets an unfair amount of flack.  Park is a man who uses symbolism in his films, so there is a lot more to this story than just a bitter extra trying to teach a supposedly ""always nice, perfectly flawless"" director a lesson, that everyone can be a horrid monster.  I could go into the details of every little thing that makes this the perfect bit of cinema that it is, but that would take far far too long.  There is a great, intelligent, insightful discussion about it on the IMDb boards, so I suggest, if curious to look into that.

Rating: 5 out of 5

""Box"" by Takashi Miike:

A total psychological mind-**** from Audition director Takashi Miike.  It focuses, or so we're lead to believe, around a young isolated woman who suffers deep regret for ""accidentally"" killing her fellow circus sideshow sister at a young age by trapping her in a box and stumbling into a lantern, casuing the tent to bo up in ablaze. (if this part is accuare I'm not sure, I actually haven't watched the film since February.)  This is, although a short film, probably Miike's most spectacularly shot film.

2471691,4,B000CRR3ME,"I'm feeling lazy tonight, so perhaps this will be a short one.  '3 Extremes' is, unsurprisingly an anthology of three short horror films, one Korean, one Japanese, and one from Hong Kong.  This sounds like a good idea to me, cause lots of Asian horror films don't have enough material to justify their length.  I  should point out that the term horror is used pretty loosely here, with none of them really qualifying as a conventional horror film, even by Asian standards.

The first film is 'Dumplings', directed by Fruit Chan.  This film is, to be blunt, disgusting.  I mean this not as a criticism, just as a simple observation.  The film centers on a peculiar sort of dumpling which can reverse the aging  process.  It's impossible to discuss this in any meaningful way without giving away the meat of it, so here it is:  The dumplings contain human fetuses.  Now, I was not especially impressed or disturbed by this premise when I first heard it, but actually watching it it proves to be very nasty.  The film doesn't have that much going on in terms of plot, though it does note the fact that anyone who is willing to eat aborted fetuses is liable to do some other unfortunate acts.

'Cut', directed by Chan-Wook Park is next, and it's my favorite.  Park directed the great 'Oldboy', and here he again sets himself apart from most Asian directors I'm familiar with by displaying energy and wit.  So much Asian horror is unrelentingly slow-paced and dreary, it's nice to see something with lotsa camera movement and over the top acting and so on.  This film centers on a home invasion by a disgruntled actor who assails a prominent horror film director and his wife.  It has an interesting twist however, in that the actor is not just jealous of the director's success, but he's also a good, upstanding man.  (He says something like, 'My life sucks, and I'm going to hell.  Where's the justice in that?)  His goal is not just to torment the director, but also to degrade him, make him compromise his morals.  The actor is very amusing to watch, pretty funny, very full of life, likable in spite of it all, and he's matched by the energetic camerawork and cluttered, brightly colored set.

'Box', directed by Takashi Miike, is the last and most conventional film of the bunch.  It is very slow moving and elegant focusing on mood along with a few surprises.  The plot concerns a grown woman who used to be part of a sideshow act where she and her sister would perform, culminating in their curling up within a box.  Turns out something rather bad happened to her sister, and she's now haunted by memories and dreams.  This film isn't terribly compelling, but it's short enough that it never gets boring, and it is pleasant to look at, and has a number of effective creepy scenes.  The final revelation is not especially impressive, but it ain't too bad either and doesn't feel like a cheat or that it's needlessly tacked on, so it works alright.  I don't doubt that this film would be interesting to view a second time simply for the sake of looking at it all in a new light.

Yeah, I'm done.  None of these films is brilliant, but they're certainly interesting, and they combine nicely in spite of their difference from one another.  Worth a look, definitely.

2471692,3,B000CRR3ME,"Three short films by three different Asian director that seek to be, according to the commentary track on Takashi Miike's ""Box,"" `what a horror story is supposed to be.'  The answer, as evidenced by these three short movies, is macabre suspense story, heavy atmospherics, demented lead characters, surrounded by occasional touches of graphic gore.

 The first movie, ""Dumpling,"" by Chinese director Fruit Chan is the best.  It's about a woman who will do, and eat, anything to retain her youthful beauty.  Genuinely suspenseful, although the movie tips its hand early on explaining what exactly it is she eats to stay beautiful.  This feels like an old, old story, a twisted nursery rhyme without a happy ending.  Most pleasant of all is the beautiful Bai Ling as the procuress in all this.  She's got a fresh, young-Shirley MacLaine thing going that keeps this one from sinking under its own grossness.

 ""Cut,"" by South Korean director Chan-wook Park, is a whole lot less compelling.  Weird movie extra kidnaps good-guy director and his wife and slowly tortures and torments them on a deserted movie set.  Talky, static, and pointless.

 Miike directed the last entry, ""Box.""  A young woman has strange dreams and painful memories of her childhood.  Lot of boxes in this movie.  Has an O. Henry surprise ending that detracts from the overall effect.  With suspense and eerieness the objective here, you can imagine how slowly this one, like `Cut,' moves.

The longer the director goes without killing the boy, the more fingers the psycho cuts from his wifes hands. By the way his wife is a pianist. It ends with thew wife biting the man to death. But then the husband kills her becuase he is confused and thinks his wife is the boy, and the boy is his wife. There was no reason or explanation offered for his confusion or maybe he did it on purpose because he wanted his wife dead all along. Regardless I didn't think it was a good ending.

 The last story is ""Box"". This one I thought was just flat out boring! There are some scary moments in this one but it's not interesting and it has another stupid ending that makes no sense.

All in all, I think ""Dumplings"" is worth seeing. ""Cut"" is OK but certainly not a must see, and ""Box"" is all fast forward material!",1143504000,2,1562,4.231543624161074
2471695,4,B000CRR3ME,"I have an iron gut. I have seen the sickest flicks out there. I love getting movies like that because Hollywood has been a joke for years now. Remake after remake and unoriginal ideas that just suck ass. I love the asian horror and twisted movies they do and thats why I have foreign and indy films as my favorite right now. Anyways.....the iron gut thing. I have seen Salo, Necromancer (which almost crossed the line with me), Sweet Movie,Cannibal Holocaust, etc. Those movies are cool because they are more original and well, gross as $h*t. Three Extremes was original and awesome. Why only 4 stars? The extreme short film Dumplings. This short flick might not have bothered me a few years back, but now that I am a parent I could barely stomach Dumplings. I vurped (vomit burp) a couple times thru it but I made it thru in the long run. The short film Cut was awesome and unexpected and that one was the best. The Box was an O.K. short but not to thrilling in my opinion. And Dumplings was a cool story , one I would definatly rank as top notch sick $h*t but like I said , as a parent it crossed the line for me.",1141603200,3,1115,4.289099526066351
2471696,4,B000CRR3ME,"Stuff like this makes me question if it's possible it could ever be made in America.  Sure, we have David Lynch, Guy Maddin, even David Cronenberg, adding to our wonderful world of extremely disturbing for the sake of disturbing filmmaking, but could they go to this level?  Or am I being unfair to say that this is a different level?  It could be the same intent with a different approach...

We have three segments, each ""extreme"" in their own way.  The first, a shockingly gross-out horror film involving foetophagia (pardon me my neologism if there happens to be a real word for said consumption out there), is about all the wonder in blood and gross biological matter you can possibly compress into gut-churning madness.  Too bad it doesn't really have much more to it than that, because honestly once you get over the initial ""gut"" reaction, there's not much more to care about... no spectacular cinematography, nothing really amazing in performances... no real reason to be a movie as opposed to a photograph, a written story, a bad tale told over candlelight.  I'll just pretend it's all symbolic of the current issue over stem-cell research and leave it at that.

The second segment, by the wonderful Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame, gets a little better.  Our little friend Park has an eye for torture, I see, as now it involves a movie director and his wife tied to his own house-like set, a disturbed extra putting him through physical and emotional turmoil.  This one has no long-winded development of psychological torture-by-hypnotism, this is straight out lose-if-you-do, lose-if-you-don't.  The focus on the stagelighting and the levels of truth and deceit make it an interestingly post-modern look at spectatorship, as now these characters are forced to look at each other take up and remove their costumes in a twisted dynamic.  Too bad that theme isn't really developed much more than just being there, because again, this film has a little bit less in terms of cinema.  It has some neat tricks here and there, just nothing to write home about.

The third segment, and my favorite, is from my man the amazing Takashi Miike of Ichi the Killer fame.  A much more atmospheric and involving film, indeed, this is the story of a woman who dreams fitfully about her accidental murder of her twin sister at the age of ten, with a slightly more complex plot invovling a circus performer and pedophilia.  Mostly films that turn out to be ""just a dream"" are kind of disappointing, but this has something fresh to add to the group.  It also has the most to offer cinematically, with real care put into editing, production design, imagery, juxtaposition, and whatever possible to embellish mood.  Of all the segments, this is the most artsy and lovely, and really a good end to round up the features we've been subjected to.

Overall, don't expect to eat comfortably after viewing this film.  Not gonna work out well.  I wouldn't expect the most amazing stuff awaiting you, but on the other hand if you're the type to be absolutely fascinated by the places the human mind will go, see how you handle this.  The Marquis de Sade would be proud.

2471697,4,B000CRR3ME,"As said in the other reviews, this full is an omnibus of three shorter films by some of Asia's most talented horror directors. Park Chanwook, Takashi Miike, and Fruit Chan are the three contributing directors.

  The first film, in the American release, is Fruit Chan's piece, and as a whole, it is the most accomplished film. The story never drifts into murky terrirory, and the characters' motivations are never far from clear. Oh, and this is also probably the hardest piece to watch. You will cringe at the sight of dumplings for some time.

  But what makes this film so great is that it is a true representation of what a horror film should do: shock while making a broad social commentary. Here, the commentary seems to be about the stagnant culture in China, of men who view women as objects, and what the women will go to to redeem themselves in the men's eyes. One of the characters in the story, the leads husband, has an affair behind her back. On the surface, this is just about the least reprehensible act in the whole movie. But stop and think. What must be noted is that it is this character's acts that lead every other plot point to fruition. Even though you may be disgusted by the last scenes, try to remember the husband, and where everything started.

  The second film is the worst, although that isn't necessarily saying much. Park Chanwook, best known here for Oldboy and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, is assuredly not at his peak here. Still, his penchant for flashy cuts makes this a far more interesting piece than it would have been in the hands of another director. It begins promisingly enough, with essentially a debate about the class struggle in Korea mixed with torture by way of piano wire and some nast bits of fingers chopped off. But soon, it slips into territory where the characters are no longer justified, and their actions have no connection to real life. By the end, it can only be called confusing and repugnant. To bad that a talent such as Park's should be wasted on this.

  The last film, by Takashi Miike, is indeed strange. Descriptions will hardly do it justice. Most importantly, it should be mentioned that as an actual film, it is a failure. It is obvious that the director has some overwhelming message here, but unlike Dumplings, where the message was obvious, or Cut, where it was clear that the dialogue would convey the message and the plot would simply be gory excess, this is neither. In fact, dialogue is close to minimum. This should come as a shock to Miike fans. It is vastly different from his other films, like Ichi the Killer. The closest it comes to is Audition. But this film has a minimum of violence. Instead, it is a haunting allegory for childhood terror. Miike himself has claimed that he was trying to convey his own fear of being trapped in his body by symbolically having the title character trapped in the box. Still, this is far from satisfactory. You must draw you own conclusions.

  And if you just want to see some of the most shocking stuff the screen has to offer, this is as good a place as any to sit down for an hour or two. Maybe you might even start to think about the social commentary, too, while you're at it.",1139443200,2,3203,4.546086956521739

8101189,1,B000CRR3ME,"Again, no English dub, no watch.

I'm not 100% opposed to watching movies subtitled.  I can't tell you how many countless Anime I watched subbed back in the day due to the limitations and format constraints of the time (VHS was only able to offer one audio track).  But once DVD's were introduced (then Blu-ray, streaming, et al), I find no excuse not to offer/create multiple language tracks in any territory studios provide movies in.  I do not want to divert my eyes from the cinematography to read lines of dialog.  And for those who don't mind this, and are so good at it that it doesn't take away from their movie watching experience, great for you.  You can consider yourself better than me.  I'll stick to my dubs, thank you.  And for those who feel I'm missing out on some great films due to a limited viewpoint, take comfort.  There are more movies out there than one can watch in a lifetime, other great movies, in English, or dubbed in English, and I'll spend my time watching those instead.  I'm entitled to my own opinion and preferences, and I'll continue to support film studios who demonstrate care for my enjoyment, providing English dubs.

Amazon needs to do a better job of labeling movies that only offer English subtitles with no dub.  They do so on some, but not on others; why?  One only has to read other similar reviews on countless movies on their site to see that this frustrates many of their customers, not just me.

As for the movie, if they make an English dub, or offer one in the future, I'll watch it and adjust my rating.  Until then, the one star is for Amazon's lack of clear labeling.",1494720000,,1623,4.491467576791809
