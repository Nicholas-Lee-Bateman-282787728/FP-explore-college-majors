8602329,2,1929588208,"When reading about this video I was lead to believe it would delve a little deeper than other ""catching"" videos. My son is 11 and learned almost nothing from it. There are no drills to enforce the skills that a catcher needs to have. I feel ""Play Ball the Major League Way""-(Pitching and Catching) does a much better job. (And it's cheaper too!!) At [price] ""D&D"" is a ""Major League"" rip off.",974160000,6,392,4.458333333333333
8602330,5,1929588208,"I have written more detailed reviews for D&D's other videos so I just wanted to say a little tid bit about this one.  As a catching instructional this tape is hands down the best that I have seen. I was most  impressed with the way the Pros teach young players a sense of leadership  and self confidence.  I hadn't realized that a catcher is similar to the  quarterback in football.  He has to take control at times and make some  very crucial decisions.  D&D did an excellent job of making a tough  position sound fun and easy.
