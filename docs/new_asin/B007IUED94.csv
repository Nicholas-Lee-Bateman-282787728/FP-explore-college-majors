5089846,4,B007IUED94,"The story starts with a girl who witnessed a murder is being hidden by the government in its witness protection program, it then continues with her experiences. The story was I thought was better than average. The writer had taken some care in thinking out many of the problems that such a girl would face. Some of the people around her were interesting characters.

The acting itself in parts could have been better. Probably, the best I thought was Jeremy Sumpter performance.

It is not a big-budget  movie so the actual filming is not spectacular, but I think it was good enough.

Overall, a watchable movie.",1341014400,5,612,4.745283018867925
5089847,1,B007IUED94,"This is just one of those run of the mill, boring, direct to video fare that translates to a bunch of junk at the end of the day.  I don't really understand the fist review here as it was written a month before the product came out so it was unlikely he was able to get an advance copy or maybe he's just associated with Dolphin Entertainment as they are located in Florida...

anyway, you might as well avoid this one.  It's not worth anyone's time....anyone at all.  the trailer for the new aimee teagarden in front of this movie looked just as bad.",1340841600,,551,4.269230769230769
5089848,5,B007IUED94,"Bought the Blu-Ray today having seen Ana's work on stage previously as well as her incredible singing. All I can say is what an incredible talent, not to mention her co-stars Jeremy and Tyler. These young actors are the next wave to hit Hollywood with a BANG! What an incredible journey for Ana, by far the best young actress I have ever seen! The passion, the drive, the talent...all I can say is WOW. Can't wait to get this in!

5089861,1,B007IUED94,"This movie is HORRIBLE!!! There are spoilers in this review so you have been warned!!

SPOILERS DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT IT SPOILED

So ""Jo"" as we know her is in the protection program, due to some mafia stuff Jo is now a key witness to a trial. So until the trial happens ""Jo"" is whisked away to somewhere with ""more cows than actual people"". okay seems ok so far.
problem #1. the 3 cliched ""popular blonde girls"" everything about them is annoying. to make it quick and simple the lead blonde girl is jealous of Jo because of an ex-boyfriends interest in Jo. Now commence cliched ganging up on the new kid. Now does Jo have some cool come back to dumb cliched blonde girls that are in every movie. No. She just uses simple ""leave me alone"" lines.

oh but the main blonde girl is supposed to be first in her class.... with a 3.9 GPA [Apparantly the producers have never heard of honors and AP classes, Like where an Ap class can range from 5-6 depending on where you live]

So even though Jo's life is in danger and she isn't supposed to do anything that could give her away, She decides to send someone from her past flowers on her birthday [which is of course how the ""bad guys"" find her] which is so infuriatingly stupid I want to punch her. Like ""oh it's dangerous to talk to anyone who used to know me, but it's their BIRTHDAY something so important, I should definitely risk my life for it!!!""

And in her cover story she lived in Chicago but it's insulting to the police who would have trained her because Jo doesn't take the time to learn anything about the city she was supposed to have lived in. So when people ask her about where she used to live, she just gives a blank look.

Then there are the two guys she can't decide between. Yeah the annoyingly overconfident jock (who really isn't that cute and main blondes ex-boyfriend) and the art guy who has more in common with her than candy and sugar. which one does she give the most attention to? The jock. Which one does she flirt with? The jock. Which one does she ask for help? The jock (okay I would have asked the jock for help too because he was the one with a car.) Which one paints tons of paintings of chicago to make her feel less homesick? Art guy. Which one uses cheesey pick-up lines and looks like he's undressing her with his eyes? The jock. I think you get the point.

So when we're at the climax and a ""bad guy"" has shown up, she does the first smart thing out of the whole movie. She calls a cop. and the first thing he tells her to do is to STAY RIGHT THERE. and she leaves the school and goes to a car.

overall a lot of the lines were predictable, the jock was the one she spent most time with, and she made really stupid decisions repetitively just to add tension and loop holes to further the plot.

I really wish I could give this movie negative stars...",1403740800,2,2844,4.222836095764273

5089863,1,B007IUED94,"My daughter loves movies like this, she loves two of the actors in this movie.  She couldn't finish it.  It was simply awful.",1367625600,,125,4.391304347826087
5089864,3,B007IUED94,"One of my favorite actors, Jeremy Sumpter, leads a mostly unknown cast in the new direct-to-video drama, Hiding. I liked the concept behind this movie, but I don't like the part of the story they chose to focus on. The writers spent too much time on the present, without telling us enough about the past. While we have an idea of what happened, watching the beginning of this film is like arriving at the theater fifteen minutes late and having to play catch up the whole time. Joe (Ana Villafane) witnessed a murder in her home town of New York City. Being that she is the key witness against a major crime family, she is put into the witness protection program, given a cover story, and put into a new life in the middle of nowhere. The film begins with Joe being dropped at her new home, with a very vague description of what happened, what's expected of her, and how long she'll be there. From there the film kind of turns into a CW teen drama, which wasn't very appealing, however the filmakers used flashbacks and side angles, to stop it from turning into Dawson's Creek. Sumpter plays one of two guys interested in Joe, as always he was dynamic, but here he was also funny and charming, a clear opposite of the other love interest, who just seemed to drone on and on. As for the lead, in her debut role, Ana Villafane was nothing short of terrific. This is not the kind of movie I go for and the focus was not on the part of the script that interests me, but the combination of Villafane and Sumpter, along with flashbacks and side stories did keep the film going. My description probably sounds quite dull, but Hiding keeps on moving and keeps your attention by using some pretty unconventional methods. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was most definitely entertaining.",1361491200,2,1792,4.483180428134556
5089865,2,B007IUED94,"Slow moving, predictable and not the least exciting.  Really, this  is at most a made for TV fill time movie",1347494400,,108,4.35

5089867,3,B007IUED94,"Ana Villafae stars as Josephine Russo, a NYC woman placed in the witness protection program. She finds herself in the small town of Longview, Montana where she is given the identity of a teen under the care of social services. She has flashbacks to her instructions as to no contact, no cell phones, and no speaking Spanish, although when angered Spanish pours from her mouth.  The high school she now attends has a group of girls similar to ""the plastics."" They are introduced with their own swagger music, and for a moment I thought this was going to be a pretty cool movie...but it didn't last long.

Josephine takes a liking to a boy named Jesse (Tyler Blackburn). Of course the head plastic (Kelcie Stranahan) doesn't like Josephine because her ex-bf is hitting on her too.

It isn't hard to figure out what is going to happen, if it didn't there wouldn't be a film.

The movie has a made for TV quality to it, down to the cliche script, second tier acting, and cheap soundtrack.

Ana, who was an artist in the film, sings a song during the closing credits to my surprise. Clearly this film was designed to showcase her talents. Too bad the script didn't support her.  Teen movie all the way.
