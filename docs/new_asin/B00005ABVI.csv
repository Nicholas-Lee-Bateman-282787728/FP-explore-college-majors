1413756,5,B00005ABVI,This double feature from SWV is one of my favorites. The specials on this are funny as hell and The Beast that Killed women is a great cheasy flick. There's tons of funny 60's nudity of women with thick brooklyn accents and it's only 60 minutes long which is a great length for a cheasy movie. The Monster of Camp Sunshine is funny but incomprihensible and takes away from the chease but is almost redeemed by the last 5 minutes of WW2 stock fotage (if you can get there without falling asleep). All and all a must see for SWV fans.,1071964800,4,532,4.2772277227722775
1413757,3,B00005ABVI,"Where to begin?? ""The Beast that Killed Women""is about an ape that has escaped and terrorizes(?)a nudist camp..Well actually he only kills one girl that I remember,but anyway...It's a fun movie. Look for the bonfire go from high to low and back and forth..some continuity problems??  As far as ""The Monster of Camp Sunshine"" goes it has to be seen to be believed. Why?Well,there is more music,less dialogue,too much padding and the so-called ""monster"" doesn't really do anything,except run around with an ax and only hurt 1 victim..The ending is laughable....It's not bad for what it is though..A movie that doesn't take itself seriously....The rest of the DVD has some pretty neat extras...",1046390400,6,691,5.115044247787611
1413758,3,B00005ABVI,"Of the two movies, The Beast is better than The Monster. No full frontal nudity in the movies (there is in ONE one trailer), but loaded with T&A.  DVD package well designed with tons of extras: trailers and vintage short nudie movies from the early century (the 20th that is...) Warning: no story and no acting !",1038009600,4,312,4.473684210526316
1413759,5,B00005ABVI,"This movie is so unique, or should I say movies? They both take place in nudist camps, the Monster From Camp Sunshine is just some retarted fat man in an old creepy house, the ending is so funny you need to see it to belive it, they take war footage from military movies and insert it into the movie to makw itr look like they are actually all attacking the man, but it's just one fat man, and they need the entire US army to take him down? Yea I guess that was the plan! The Beast That Killed Women is more of a gorilla creature, both movies contain alot of nudity but no sexuality, there are tons of trailers for other ""nudie cutie"" films. So many trailers it's worth the buy, the movies are so strange they are really fun to watch.",1025568000,2,734,4.13986013986014

7935366,5,B00005ABVI,"This is my fourth or fifth Something Weird DVD. Once you get a thing for them, it's hard to stop. That being said, I don't watch these films for their aesthetic cinematic value. These DVDs work as a snapshot of an era - an era, mind you, in which I wasn't alive yet...but it's fascinating stuff. And this stuff is never gonna be restored or updated to Blu-ray, so buy them up now. Besides, there's a certain joy to watching scratched, spliced, mold-damaged films on a top of the line HD TV.
Unlike other reviewers, I'm gonna talk about the extras first. They are always the hidden joy of SW DVDs. Firstly, the whole dvd has this drive-in vibe, with 20 minutes or so of drive-in ad reels including: ads for Sprite, Vespa, Ed McMahon hawking Budweiser, as well as a slew of ""Please Visit Our Refreshment Stand"" ads.
Their are several nudie shorts included, covering from the 1920s through the 50s. ""Bring Em Back Nude"" even includes the ""drop another dime"" breaks from when it ran in peep booths. My fave though is ""Back to Nature"" the one from '54. Firstly, it is oddly heat damaged (making it largely magenta)...but also several lovely women in it - proving that it wasn't all cottage cheese and sucking in stomachs in the 50s. And looking for hidden agendas - whoever filmed this one had a thing for the pubescent blonde - she's in most of the shots, and definitely not legal. My favorite part is where this older guy is barbecuing, and he just keeps staring at this redheads woman's butt instead of cooking. Can't blame him...Hell, just throw sauce on her, guy!
I usually don't much care for the exploitation art with audio oddities feature, but this disc has a good batch....I wanna see ""Massage Parlor Hookers"" or ""Little Whorehouse On the Prairie""! And the movie posters are insane - can you imagine a triple feature of ""Last House On the Left"",  Bava's ""Twitch Of the Death Nerve"", and the brutal Inquisition film ""Mark Of the Devil""? Wow!

As to the features, they're enjoyable. ""The Beast That Killed Women"" is a naive low budget joy. With it's Florida-level talent and bright Eastmancolor photography, it reminds me a lot of ""Blood Feast"". Red just drips from the film....hair, skin tones - makes it more garishly enjoyable for me. Just watch the scene where the two girls are jumping for a towel - the color just POPS! Granted, 50% of the movie is topless girls standing around talking about how scared they are, but is that a bad thing? And keep an eye out for a young Juliet Anderson (aka 70s porn star Aunt Peg) as Ms. Johnson, the bait the police use to trap the beast. What, don't know who Aunt Peg is? Never seen ""Taboo""? Oh, you kids... Although it's interesting: the one woman in this who later went on to fame in the adult industry, and she doesn't take her clothes off!

""Monster Of Camp Sunshine"" is a real oddity. The Pythonesque opening credits, the fact that a lot of it runs like a silent film (intertitles included), edited and photographed by Motley Crue (no, not those guys). The lead, Claire, is a stunning brunette who disinterestedly strips out of her clothes several times. A particularly striking scene is where she has a topless shoot on top of the Flatiron Building in New York. The ending of the film defies description but I'll try: a mutated hillbilly, our nude heroines, WW2 stock footage, a civil war (?) battle, a paratrooper to the rescue, an Army captain who looks like Borat, and a man with a gun wearing the worst-looking pair of tighty whities you've ever seen. And the minute-long recap at the end is amazing - it's like the movie is saying ""what, you expect me to be serious about this?"". It runs like an inept art film that happens to be a nudie with a sense of humor. It is 3 or 4 films on a collision course, and it's a joy to watch!

So, three hours of 60's nudie strangeness - go for it, people!",1415232000,2,3848,4.508595988538682

7935368,3,B00005ABVI,"Ultra cheesy, bad acting and a weak story line.  Pretty much sums this double feature up.  But if your like me, a lover of the old school B rate movies.... you should enjoy this dvd.",1356825600,,182,4.171428571428572
7935369,5,B00005ABVI,"Fantastic trip down memory lane. All natural women. Bee-hive hair-dos. Cars with fins. Smoking in a hospital bed, one that only feeds you jello and saltines. Ugly orange frames on all the pictures, off centered on the wall. The movies themselves are horrible. I suggest watching the second feature first as it is in black and white. It has Ed Wood elements as it splices in some war footage.

The first feature is in color. I would watch it second as to avoid a let down. The camera is careful as to prevent any fur from entering the film. In fact it was Austin Powers' comical. Women would walk away from the camera nude, but would return facing the camera with a strategically placed towel. Was there a towel factory off camera? In the volley ball scene, women facing away from the camera were bottomless, those facing the camera had on bottoms. What was that dance scene?

The extras is what makes the DVD. There is a silent soft core movie which includes ""dime deposit"" messages. The camera angles were less discrete as the main features. There are some actual nudist camp scenes, which jolted my ""Blind Faith"" album cover memory. They are interesting from an historical point of view, but I suspect in the future their reproduction may be restricted.

No f-bombs, just plenty of nudity.",1328486400,,1291,4.6784140969163
7935370,3,B00005ABVI,"The common denominator for this week's double-bill from Something Weird is that they both take place at nudist camps.  However, you want to have the complete Something Weird experience with this week's DVD.  Remember all the stuff they used to show in between movies at the drive-in?  Well those are more than covered if you push the right button to start the festivities with this DVD.  There are ads for goodies from the snack bar and trailers for the first feature, ""The Beast That Killed Women"" and other films set in nudist camps including ""Goldilocks and the Three Bares,"" the first nudist musical in ""Seymourscope"" (think about it).

""The Beast That Killed Women,"" directed by Barry Mahon in 1965, takes us to a nudist camp where people are forever walking away from the camera thereby providing an endless supply of naked bottoms.  The camp members are playing volleyball or jumping up and down trying to get a sundress at the top of a stone wall while pleasant music plays before it is time to go to bed, at which point the ladies get semi-dressed.  What a shame a beast is going to interrupt the fun.  Then everybody who is still awake gathers in front of a fire on the beach.  They are all dressed and are watching a young woman dressed in short blue skirt and top dance to the beat of the drums in what would be the most sensual moment of the film, when suddenly a gorilla with a dark blue face appears in the bushes.  Once everybody is in bed (with the lights on) the beast goes on the attack.  Expect lots of screaming and the beast carrying and dragging struggling (dressed) women around and not much else.  Also expect to have a hard time understanding what people are saying at times in this movie (then you do and they are talking about ""an ambulance coming downstairs"").  The framing device is the police questioning a survivor of the slaughter, so he gets to provide narrative details that allows us to skip what must have been the really boring parts.

Not really, because when the ambulance comes downstairs to get the first dead body we follow the entire procedure like we have nothing better to do (or look at) for several minutes.  My favorite part is when someone assures the police it really was a gorilla and not somebody dressed in a gorilla outfit.  The most important thing is that despite the attacks that most of these people stay at their nudist camp (which, I must point out, is integrated).  The trailer fooled me into thinking that the beast was going to kill a lot of women, but that is not really the case.  But maybe that is the point as we celebrate the return to order as the police leave the camp and return to the real world of inhibitions and confining social mores.  To be fair, this does make nudists look like ordinary people and the guys wear swim trunks when they dive into the pool to keep the film clean

Then we get to the Intermission.  ""Nude Ranch"" involves badminton played by women in cowboy hats, bandanas, and half skirts (just in front).  Then we get suckered by ""The Great Train Robbery"" into a series of ads for food that moves tantalizingly slow across the screen for minutes without end.  Nostalgia has nudity beat on this DVD, even if it is the 1961 trailer for ""Nudist Life"" and the short ""Bring 'em Back Nude"" which is way older and in which sis makes herself at home in her brother's apartment while he is away and reads in his diary about an encounter with a couple of white goddesses in Africa. I think they spliced footage from Tarzan movies or National Geographic into this along with another guy in an ape suit.  As soon as we get to the naked goddesses we are told to ""Drop another dime for the next attractive subject,"" which tells us something about how you got to see this silent bit of cinema (you needed 50 cents for the complete narrative experience).  Not surprisingly, the ""Beauty and the Beast"" short that I had seen on a previous DVD pops up here: it involves a dancing girl (i.e., stripper) who eventually gets attacked by (you guessed it) a guy in an ape suit.  Then there is the trailer for ""Eves on Skis,"" which involves natural girls basking in Alpine splendor, ""Nudes on Tiger Reef"" is the playground of the stars apparently, and ""The Expose of the Nudist Racket"" which puts nudism in the same class with Darwinism, Buddhism, Baptism, Natziism (sic), Journalism and dozen more -isms.  By the time you get to ""Back to Nature,"" which is in color, you just want to get to the second feature film.  Then you can come back and check out the ""Gallery of Drive-In Exploitation Art with Trash-O-Rama Radio-Spot Rarities.""

It is hard to have expectation for ""The Monster of Camp Sunshine, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Nature,"" directed by Ferenc Leroget in 1964, especially when we are told this motion picture is a ""fable"" because there are many nudists and only one monster (whereas life is generally the other way around).  But the title credits look they were done by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python's Flying Circus, which is a pleasant surprise.  A young woman heads away from New York City to Camp Sunshine where she enjoys the simple pleasures of her new found life.  The problem is that a scientist dumps some toxic stuff into the river.  Hugo, the rather simple fellow who is the gardener at the nudist camp, drinks the water and turns into a monster.  This is similar to the first film in that we have mostly shots of the nudists sitting in the sun or having fun flying a kite and then suddenly there is a monster.

You can really make an argument that this would be a better film without the monster.  Watching a woman in a revealing bathing suit pose in front of the Empire State Building is more memorable then anything at the camp until the laughingly over the top conclusion.  Hugo has his share of problems as a monster but that is what provides the narrative arc for this film because otherwise these people go Camp Sunshine and do the same thing week after week during from Memorial Day to Labor Day.  This also allows for increasingly tacky title cards to help make up for the lack of a compelling narrative until the situation is resolved by a guy in his underwear who has not only a gun but dynamite and a Tommy gun, a helpful skydiver, and a captain who shows up with the U.S. army (along with the U.S. cavalry, a large amphibious force, and long range cannons from both World War II and the Civil War) to save the day and make Camp Sunshine safe once more for Americans to take off their clothes and embrace nature.  Then there is a brief summary of the supposedly good parts in case you missed them.  Really.

""The Beast That Killed Women"" (a.k.a. ""The Beast That Molested Women"" and ""The Beast That Ruined Women"") gets rated two stars but ""The Monster of Camp Sunshine"" (a.k.a. ""Monster at Camp Sunshine"") gets rated three just so you know which one is better.  The extras, as is usually the case with these Something Weird DVDs, are the best part of your three-and-a-half hour late night experience and would be four stars (talking strictly entertainment value).  Do the math and then divide by three because dividing by two would be just too darn cheeky after watching all these nudists.  Be sure to join us next Saturday gang, when we try for a different genre of exploitation cinema with ""Just for the Hell Of It"" and ""Blast-off Girls.""",1112400000,,7359,4.534039334341906
7935371,1,B00005ABVI,"First off, I apologize for the pun in my title, but it is unfortunately descriptive. As a disclaimer, I generally like Something Weird DVDs, but this one is terrible. The biggest sin of both these films is that they are stunningly boring. I was looking forward to the dreadful, nonsensical plots, bad acting, and silly extras, but in this case the entire DVD was so boring as to be virtually unwatchable.

Some of the Drive-In advertisements were modestly entertaining (I am still grossed out by the ad for ""Toddy"" a delicious chocolate drink in a can that is great hot or cold, or so they say...) but the two features were uninteresting in the extreme. There are only two positive things I can say about these features: first, the gorilla in ""The Beast That Killed Women"" is the worst man in a gorilla suit that I have ever seen (possibly exclusive of ""Queen Kong""); and second, the credit sequence for ""The Monster Of Camp Sunshine"" is a hilarious piece of animated lunacy.

Of the two I liked ""The Monster Of Camp Sunshine"" better, as it was the cleverer of the two, although the monster is extremely lame. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Marta (the only not unattractive cast member) gets pushed out of a New York high rise window by some sadistic laboratory mice. I found the conclusion of the film which involved a paratrooper in pajamas and an ascot, as well as stock footage from the Normandy invasion, and (apparently) a re-enactment of the battle of Gettysburg, to be a mite confusing. The best idea was the last minute of the film which featured a one minute (or so) recap of the feature. You can feel free to watch that and not feel like you missed anything. (You didn't.)

The short titled ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a truly stunning piece of musical mayhem. It is the only portion of this DVD I can really recommend.",1094601600,7,1839,4.583586626139818
