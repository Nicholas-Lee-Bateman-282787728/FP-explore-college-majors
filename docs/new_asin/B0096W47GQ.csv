8537032,5,B0096W47GQ,"Great collection of dog films, though many of the movies themselves are terrible. :) Hope Gaiam will do another canine-themed pack!

The Retrievers - 3 stars, originally an Animal planet movie. Cute story about a family moving to a new home and finding a pregnant dog, then trying to take care of the puppies. Good for kids, but nothing special.

Dog Gone - 4 stars, better than expected. Much too long and ridiculously predictable, but the relationship between the boy and the dog is great.

Aussie and Ted's Great Adventure - 4 1/2 stars, best of the collection. I had very low expectations for this one, and the talking teddy bear is pretty silly, but was surprised by the production quality and the mostly clever storyline. It's nothing new (a sibling rivalry/new baby angle) but well-told through the eyes of a Beagle from Australia (living with a family in San Francisco). This one makes the whole collection worth the price.

Cop Dog - 1 star, ugh. Absolutely ridiculous, and not because of the ghost dog. Awful film and inappropriate for young or sensitive kids to boot. If you're watching with kids, skip this one.

Miracle Dogs - 2 stars, originally an Animal planet movie. A cute premise, inspired by a true story, and there the fun ends. Bad script and boring, slow plot for any age.

Miracle Dogs Too - See previous.

The Gold Retrievers - 1 1/2 stars, not actually about a dog and questionable to include on this collection. There is a dog in it, an adult yellow Labrador Retriever, not a puppy, as shown on the cover, but the dog is a sideline to a poorly written, poorly acted, and very silly story.

First Dog - 3 stars, one I had really wanted to see and a surprising disappointment. As with Cop Dog, this one is not appropriate for younger kids. It's very long for the genre (could have half an hour cut) and deals with a lot of scary, adult situations (kidnap, substance abuse, theft, smuggling, and other issues). The dog is interesting and the little boy is wonderful in First Dog, but, overall, this film is sadly a miss.",1375401600,4,2044,4.596153846153846
