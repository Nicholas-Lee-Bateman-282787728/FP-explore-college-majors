8623043,4,B00GGZEZRW,"Very good, insightful DVD. Argus always was my favorite Wishbone Ash album so it's especially interesting to hear the behind the scenes stories about the making of the album. But I can't figure out why Andy Powell is on the DVD cover when he is not even included in any of the interviews. He was a vital member of the band. Not that it matters in the quality.",1481760000,,359,4.294117647058823
8623044,5,B00GGZEZRW,"Be forewarned-this is a critical review of the Argus album by Wishbone Ash, not a concert show.  Probably not for those who are unfamiliar with Wishbone Ash, but for true fans like myself, it offers and in-depth review by rock journalists and musicians.",1459123200,,253,4.883720930232558

8623047,4,B00GGZEZRW,"Unlike many of the titles in this series, this one actually features some excellent insight into not only the Argus album, but the first three Wishbone Ash albums. The history of the band is covered and their legacy is discussed. Founding member bassist/vocalist Martin Turner plays the original master tapes, mixing down various instruments to point out overlooked parts or explaining how they recorded certain things. Original guitarist Ted Turner makes an all too brief appearance, but with two original members participating, this is a rarity with this company. The bonus tracks are superb, with three tracks from a US TV appearance in '73 as well as two tracks recorded for the BBC. This is as close to a documentary on Wishbone Ash as you're ever likely to see, and with five songs by the ORIGINAL band, you can't go wrong. Check it out!",1339804800,,843,4.861111111111111
