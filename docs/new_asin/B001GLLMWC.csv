I watched this movie on television long time ago but I loved the content of the movie... the love the Paris which I have visited many times with my sons and husband and I love fashion .... of course I watched it again and walk with you in Paris and wondered ????  Mr. Springfield is a wonderful actor and musician and  you can see his heart is  in his role and he sing from his heart ... my son Christopher  saw him in Las Vegas few years back. me and my sons loves Rick Springfield.... Hope to see another movie... or music

I just got another movie Hard to Hold  God... my son Christopher and me loves it and now my son Daniel took it from me before I had a chance to watch it... so you can see how we love it no fight in the house as yet ... those are my purchase but I love my sons enough to let them borrow it...

All the best to Mr. Springfield and his family.... with love and respect Marcelle",1338768000,,922,3.9782608695652173
3614596,5,B001GLLMWC,"HARLEQUIN DOES IT AGAIN; THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE; ROMANCE, INTRIGUE, THE LIFE OF FASHION AND THE LIVES OF TWO TWINS WHO CHANGE LIVES TO HELP EACH OTHER  AND ONE FINDS LOVE WHERE SHE LEAST EXPECTED IT.",1317859200,2,198,4.351351351351352
3614597,5,B001GLLMWC,"Put aside realism for a moment and enjoy this movie. It had glitz and glamour with a bit of intrigue and suspense thrown in. The gorgeous Andrea Roth plays both Kim and Kate ""Domenique"" Jameson, and the duel role showcases this actress' wide range of acting as she alternates between the bookish sister and the glamorous sister in the early part of the movie. The scenes where the twins are together are very well done.

Rick Springfield as Philippe looks older and a little worse for wear when up close, but no woman in her right mind would say he isn't still handsome. He has perfected the soap opera look from his work on General Hospital and he gives a fine performance of a distrustful hero with a painful past. I must admit I have a soft spot for Rick, who comes from my hometown of Sydney. And who can forget his hit song from the 80's, Jessie's Girl?

The first-rate supporting cast includes the beautiful Stephanie Beacham (Dynasty) and classical actor, Ian Richardson, who appeared in a wide variety of films throughout his career. Add to the mix magnificent buildings, grand architecture and stunning art. Music with a trendy background beat gives the movie a liveliness that complements the cosmopolitan storyline. A really enjoyable movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Society-Seduction-Silhouette-Desire/dp/0373730659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High-Society Seduction (Silhouette Desire)</a>",1289001600,6,1456,5.554054054054054
3614598,3,B001GLLMWC,"Twenty-something Kimberly is as different as night and day from her identical-twin sister Domenique (both parts played by Andrea Roth). Kimberly is a dedicated scholar working on her Ph. D. in art history, and Domenique is a successful model based in Paris. Kimberly hasn't seen her sister in years when she suddenly shows up on Kimberly's doorstep in the U.S. It is obvious Domenique has a major drinking problem, but she has been unable to check herself into a rehab facility for fear her career will tank in the ultra-competitive world of modeling while she is out of commission for 28 days. When Kimberly expresses concern and states she wishes she could help her sister, it suddenly occurs to Domenique that with a bit of fashion and grooming help, Kimberly could be a dead ringer for her and actually take her place in Paris for a few weeks while she gets medical help. Though Kimberly protests strongly at first, it is clear that her sister's very survival is at stake and she ultimately gives in.

Life as a model is far more challenging than Kimberly could have imagined, but what truly takes her by surprise is the powerful attraction she feels toward Philippe (Rick Springfield), the co-owner of the famous fashion house where Domenique is scheduled to participate in a huge, glitzy fashion show--in spite of the fact that it's no fun to be on the receiving end of the disdain that the handsome and sophisticated Philippe clearly feels for Domenique. On Philippe's side, he is amazed to discover that the flighty Domenique he's previously viewed as a drunken mess has amazing depths he never previously suspected.

For fans of Rick Springfield as a talented actor, this movie will be a treat. But fans of Rick as a singer may be disappointed that he doesn't sing, as he did for the fun movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-to-Hold/dp/B00009AOBL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard to Hold</a>, filmed 10 years before this one at the height of his fame as a rocker. This movie isn't a romantic comedy either, as is HTH, but it is a pleasant, light drama for those who want to spend a relaxing hour and a half enjoying the interaction of two attractive, appealing romantic leads and the exciting sights and sounds of Paris.

For those who read Harlequin Romance novels, you will notice that there is not nearly as much emphasis on the romance as is the case in the novel the film is based on. The focus in the movie is much more on the relationship of the two sisters initially, and later on the ""fish out of water"" tale of Kimberly dealing with the various messes her alcoholic sister has gotten herself into prior to Kimberly taking over Domenique's life. The romance doesn't get warmed up until well into the film. But Rick does a good job as the male romantic lead once it begins.",1282953600,8,2839,4.873706004140787

3614600,5,B001GLLMWC,"As I stated in another review of harlequin turned movie, I enjoy these simplistic movies. I really enjoyed this one. I thought it was rather good and I am not sorry I made the purchase.

3614602,1,B001GLLMWC,"I'm a HUGE Rick Springfield fan, but even given that, I can not recommend this movie.  It's pretty amateur-ish.  It's also poorly acted & just not good.  I've actually already donated it to Goodwill!",1245456000,,199,4.794117647058823

3614604,5,B001GLLMWC,"Interesting romance movie with romantic tension and intrigue and an interesting twist in the story.  If your looking for a ""take me away"" movie and one you want to watch over and over this is it!!!!  At least in my opinion.  Nothing like a Harlequin movie.  Love a great romance with romantic tension between the characters!!!!  Why can't American romance movies be made like this, especially without all the psychological drivel or the ding bat fluff!  Canada has made the best romance movies in my opinion.",1243036800,13,508,4.848837209302325

3614625,5,B001GLLMWC,Love this movie. I saw this movie a very long time ago. I didn't know where to find it. A family member discovered it for me on Amazon.com. So I bought it. Boy!! I was so happy to actually own it and can see it whenever I want. That's great!!  Thank you.,1501113600,,254,3.8846153846153846
3614626,5,B001GLLMWC,"A Change Of Place starred Rick Springfield, with great support from the fine actress Stephanie Beacham. She makes anything worth watching. A romance story that many will love. Fans of Rick Springfield, and Stephanie Beacham will like this the most.",1489017600,,248,5.225
3614627,5,B001GLLMWC,"rick is a little restrained in his acting on this movie which fits with his character. all the actors and actresses did a great job. they could have used another few pages of plot though.  .the villain was that easily fooled into giving up ALL his evidence for blackmail  and she easily walked away from him though he threatened to kill her before..  also the designer who time and again says he takes care of his girls like family but has the costumer in tears and is over eager to fire her on the flimsiest of circumstantial evidence and wouldn't let her explain .thank god the heroine stepped in for her in time . I wouldn't want him in my family. it could have used a little more in the romance  ,noticing she's changed  stuff. it was too abrupt and he accepted and fell in love with her a little too quickly..
I liked the movie and will watch it again later on.",1460764800,2,866,4.288343558282208

8305908,5,B001GLLMWC,"This is a wonderful film and Paris is a star of it.  The beautiful sites of Paris are highlighted in the film:  The Eiffel Towel, in all its majesty, The Arc de Triomphe, The Champs Elysee, The Artists' Walk, the streets of Paris and its outdoor cafes. Magnifique!  Paris is a magical city.  I have been to Paris four times, and loved every minute I spent there.  This film brought back such fond memories of that magnificent city.

The film also highlights the fashion world, showing gorgeous outfits, as beautiful models walk down the runway.  The thrust of the film is about twin sisters who exchange places, one of whom is a high-fashion model who has to go into rehab for a drinking problem, and the other a brilliant scholar, well-versed in art, who takes her sister's place on the runway.  What ensues is a romance.  What also ensues is a jealous competitor who employs blackmail to try to steal sketches from the famous fashion house the twin model is modelling for.

I enthusiastically recommend this film.",1525651200,,1015,4.68361581920904
