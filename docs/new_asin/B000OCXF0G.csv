8184238,5,B000OCXF0G,"My granddaughter picked signing up right away with the signing safari DVDs we checked out at the library. She learned enough signs by 13 mo  to have a conversation with a representative from the Signing Safari Education Team who visited the library.  We never went to the classes, just watched the cool videos and learned a fun new skill.  She taught her younger brother and sister baby signs when they came along.  Now there is a fourth sibling and I just decided I had to have my own set of DVDs for him. Surprising and fun scenarios.",1430092800,,536,4.494845360824742
8184239,5,B000OCXF0G,"This DVD stands out from the crowd! The rhymes are catchy, the kids are adorable and the concepts apply to everyday life with children. I find it useful for grandparents who like the idea of sharing a ""secret"" language with their grandkids. Let's face it, those little voices are getting harder to hear, so it not only helps them care for the kids' needs, but encourages their hands to move (good for arthritis) and gives their minds something new to learn!",1220572800,,457,4.654320987654321
8184240,5,B000OCXF0G,I attended the Signing Safari classes and they were very helpful along with having the video.  I started teaching my daughter signs at age 8 months and she picked it up right away.  She's now almost three and knows over 100 plus signs and is now putting three words together.  It's amazing.  She loves it.,1176681600,2,305,4.490909090909091
8184241,5,B000OCXF0G,"This stuff really works.  I started taking the Signing Safari classes with my daughter at 4 months old.  She is now 11 months and signing ""eat"".  She loves to watch the video... it definitely keeps her attention.",1176595200,2,212,4.675675675675675
8184242,5,B000OCXF0G,"This DVD is amazing...I started taking the Signing Safari classes when my son was 4 months old and bought the DVD when our session ended.  He is now 11 months old and we are still taking the classes and he LOVES the video.  He is already signing back to us with ""milk"" and ""more""!  This is amazing.......",1176595200,,304,4.298245614035087
