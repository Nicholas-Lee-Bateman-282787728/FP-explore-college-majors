1649901,4,B00005QW5Y,"I saw the movie on TNT.  I loved it because it told the Authurian tale from the womens perspective.  It had all the scandal,betrayal and love that molds a great movie.  The movie inspired me to read the book by Bradlay (which was great also)and look into the pagan rites and rituals.  Being from celtic lines it definatley interested me and entertained.  KUDOS to TNT for bringing history alive to all",1006128000,2,401,4.591549295774648
1649902,3,B00005QW5Y,"Yes, it is a TV movie of the best book I have in my collection, I drooled over this for months. But when it came time to actually watch it.... At first I hated it. They left out some of the best parts, the parts that explained things, and the good parts, like when Lancelot was fooled by Morgaine and Elaine... It was so disappointing. The changes in the plot I didn't like either, like when Viviane was killed, not by the son of the woman she helped to die peacefully, but by Morgause? That didn't make sense...
Then I read around on the internet, read some reviews by other pagans, who brought up good points- that it had to be suitable for the masses, that it had to be interesting enough for people of the traditional religions to want to watch it, but not be offensive to them, which I'm sure the book would have been. The ending had nothing to do with the book either, but I liked it, it worked.
Hubby was getting quite frustrated with me as I kept interrupting the movie: ""It wasn't like *that* in the book.."" and he'd have to pause it and listen to what was wrong with the movie.. Thank Goddess he's patient. :}
Don't watch this if you want a faithful retelling of the book- it's not like that. And don't watch it and never read the book- there is a world of difference between them.

1649903,3,B00005QW5Y,"Visually beautiful, musically enchanting, perfectly cast, this movie drew me back again and again.  I was transported by the misty lakes, green hills, and evocative soundtrack, yet the enjoyment was purely superficial.  The movie is not MZB's ""Mists,"" but a poor adaptation that reproduces selected events and characters without capturing the novel's spirit.  Condensing 876 pages to four hours, with half the time spent on the first 250 pages, completely undermines a thorough understanding of Paganism and its conflict with Christianity.  I was disappointed that Christianity was repeatedly shown to be the sole refuge for those seeking peace and forgiveness, while the Goddess religion was reduced to fertility rites.  The characters, though brilliantly portrayed, lack depth and seem more like the proverbial cardboard cut-outs than human beings.  In addition, the makers of this film did not concern themselves with story continuity. Many events were changed, but other events and dialog were not modified to reflect those changes, resulting in numerous inconsistencies.  Igraine is shown wearing a crescent, marking her as dedicated to the Goddess, yet she is married to ""Britain's greatest Christian warrior"" and he to her.  Morgause performs a certain ritual and tells her husband of it, yet later the two speak as though it never happened. Viviane is shown early in the movie to be an active, powerful force for Pagan preservation, yet later does nothing when it falls out of favor at Camelot.
 I sincerely hope that another, truer version of the book will be made by someone who loves and understands it as much as Peter Jackson loves ""The Lord of the Rings.""",1004400000,10,1669,5.2209737827715355
1649904,1,B00005QW5Y,"...then you throw yourself on it.
Such is my impression of TNT's ""The Mists of Avalon"". MZB's book upon which this retelling is based is one of my favorite books of all time. When I heard that TNT was making a movie ersion I was excited... ooOOooooh, the same people who did ""Animal Farm"" and ""Moby Dick"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" (all of which I thoroughly enjoyed) were going to adapt a book which I have read and reread several times since my senior year in high school. I watched TNT looking for previews, commericials, anything in which I could see the appropriatley beautiful and haunted-looking Juliana Marguiles (as Morgaine) and the iron-faced Anjelica Houston (as Viviane) shine in their roles. And ooOOOOoooh the ads tempted and teased me. They showed a movie that was carefully constructed and lovingly filmed in perfect locations with the perfect mood.
Well, they lied. What else can I say?
When The Day finally arrived to watch, I was glued to my TV, and as time progressed I was still glued to my TV waiting for the movie to really ""start"". Six hours (or was it days?) later TMoA finished and I was left feeling hollow. This was it? What were they thinking??
It's... well, it's cheesy (when it should be dignified); it's banal (when it should be sexy); it's simple (when it should be subtle); and it's bland (when it should be interesting).  There was no meat in which to sink my teeth..  no emotions for anyone (maybe for morgaine)..  no anger at the hypocrisy of people...  *sigh*  It's another example of how A Good Book Can Go Bad on Film, which is sad because TNT had been doing so well up until then.
Told from the viewpoint of Morgaine (Le Fey), the history of Camelot is laid out as Christians and Druids vie for control of Dark Ages England by supporting the High King Arthur, each trying to ensure their survival in England's future. But here it really boiled down to a love story between Arthur and Gwenhwyfar, Gwenhwyfar and Lancelot, Lancelot and Arthur, Morgaine and Lancelot and Morgaine and Arthur. No real political or religious strife was shown; but ironically no hearts really seemed to be broken. All the passion of Camelot was dropped for the beauty of the image.. no one got dirty, the colors were way too bright, the moods were shallow and, honestly, for as much gold as Gwenhwyfar was decked out in I'm surprised she could stand up. Poor frail thing. Avalon was full up with veiled-women (which reminded me of Paradise Island in the Lynda Carter Wonder TV series) and magic that was uninteresting to say the least - where was the awe of the Goddess?  The horror of The Sight? And what was going on with Joan Allen's eye make-up?? That star-burst design was distracting in the least and Cleopatra Schwartz in the extreme. And why were all the Christians so clean?  Thomas Aquinas himself eschewed bathing in favor of fleas whom he referred to as ""my little brothers"".  I doubt there was that much yellow in the world back then.
To be fair, though, I *was* touched two times during the movie - when Arthur and Morgaine were separated as children; and when Mordred was told his destiny was to betray his father Arthur. There was real emotin behind those moments. Sadly, they were brief. I also have to applaud TNT for not backing down form the incest issue, as it was integral to the plot.. even if they did A.) beat it over our heads, and B.) never really explain WHY Morgaine had to have a child with Arthur. The idea that Mordred would be raised to be the next High King as he was from two royal bloodlines (Pendragon and Avalon) was lost somewhere, so the incest in the movie just became kinda... well, gross. Noble effort, bad follow through.
I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. Sorry, guys, I didn't.",1004140800,48,3754,4.584202682563339
1649905,4,B00005QW5Y,"Ancient Britain. The Romans have abandoned this outlying colony, leaving the inhabitants to defend themselves against repeated waves of invasion from the barbarian Saxons.  Britain itself is divided between adherents of the new religion Christianity and the pagan followers of the Goddess.  The mysterious island Avalon, ruled by the High Priestess (also called the Lady of the Lake), is the magical seat of power for the pagans.  Along with their wizard ally Merlin (played by Michael Byrne), the Lady (Angelica Huston) and the Queen of Lothian Margause (Joan Allen) believe that the Brits, both Christian and pagan, can be unified - but only by the right king.  Their prophecy indicates that this king must be conceived by Duchess Igraine (Caroline Goodall) and fathered by the powerful and popular Uther Pendragon (Mark Lewis Jones).  Igraine is reluctant to fulfill such a prophecy, as it will mean breaking her vows to her husband, the Duke of Gorlois (Clive Russell).  Nonetheless, the deed is accomplished, with Arthur as the result.  While still a boy, Arthur (Edward Atterton) is separated from his parents and his half-sister Morgaine (Julianna Margulies), to be tutored by Merlin.  Morgaine is taken by the Lady of the Lake to Avalon, to be brought up as a priestess to the Goddess.  But prophecy has a price - great sacrifice and suffering result as these players try to find happiness and fulfillment during dangerous times.
TNT's two-part miniseries is based on Marion Zimmer Bradley's classic ""feminist retelling"" of the King Arthur legend.  It's a complex tale, with at least a dozen major characters and various interweaving plots.  Unlike many feminist fantasies, in which the women are portrayed simply as the victims of brutal and oppressive men, The Mists of Avalon depicts powerful women both good and evil, as petty and exploitive as the men with whom they involve themselves.  From the trickery which leads Igraine to break her marital vows, to the unwitting manipulation which causes Arthur to commit incest with Morgaine, to the cruel brainwashing of Morgaine's son Mordred, the priestesses of the Goddess are the true drivers of history in their world.  Huston and Marguiles - indeed, all the cast - deliver excellent performances in a story as tragic as any Shakespeare ever told.  This 4-hour miniseries is beautifully filmed, with a wonderful soundtrack by Loreena McKennitt.

1649906,3,B00005QW5Y,"Could have been much better though some of the scenes in this film are worth watching...if you've read the book.  Throughout the scenes depicting Morgaine's training...well, lets say those are the most worthwhile ones.  Juliana Margulies was perfectly cast in this role.  Joan Allen and Anjelica Houston also give great performances.  However, if I were to have had my hand in the making of this movie, I would have added at least an extra two hours to it so that it didn't seem to be moving so fast.  I also would have (and pardon my saying so) recast Mordred, Arthur, Lancelot, and Uther.  The women did fine...the men...well, lets say they need dialect training and some acting lessons.
Oh, and as a side note, the music (especially Loreena McKennitt's Mystic's Dream) is fantastic.  Go get the soundtrack.",1001894400,3,809,4.861313868613139

1650213,5,B00005QW5Y,"The Mists of Avalon deals with the delicate and controversial question on- via scriptwriting-between what a people may want in their life versus their destiny.  The special features of the Mists of Avalon dvd list some of the following actors and actresses; Anjelica Huston as Viviane High Priestess of Avalon and Lady of the Lake, Juliana Marguiles as Morgaine, Joan Allen as Marguise, Samantha Mathis as Gwenhyear, Caroline Goodall as Igraine, Edward Atterton as Arthur, Michael Vartan as Lancelot, Michael Byrne as Merlin, and Hans Matheson as Mordred.  The character of Viviane has the difficult task of somehow  bringing together Uther (Mark Lewis Jones)and Igraine while simultaneously helping Morgaine live up to outline of her destiny (while also preserving the spirit power of Avalon and enlisting the help of Merlin).  The movie also shows what happens when Morgaine decides to go without Vivianes counsel for a while (which unexpectedly gave me the idea to eventually look into asking a life coach for help in 2016).  Anyhow, Morgaine is close both her family members Arthur and Lancelot.  Arthurs wife Gwenhwyfar means well but is conflicted in her marriage due to her unexpected romantic interest in Lancelot.  The Mystics Dream song by Loreena Mckennitt plays in part of the movie. Despite my interest in screenwriting, I must avoid getting too much more into the plot for concern of giving too much detail away especially with the controversy of how Mordred is conceived-which is equally shocking on the level of the movie Excalibur. Anyhow, some of the special features attributed to the Mists of Avalon dvd- Costumes (Shows the Design Costume Sketches of various characters), storyboards And Additional scenes. The following Are some of the Additional scenes; roundtable scene involving Uther Pendragon, Morgaines father, And the other knights of the roundtable, Morgaines sword dance, Ravens mystical prayer, Viviane And Merlin discuss the future, Morgaine Attacked in Cottage, Mordred Arrests Arthur, Morgause lobbies for Mordred to be king.

It did not work, I made sure it wasn't my mistake, before I said anything. But, after explaining to customer service, they helped find a way to adjust the situation.

If you allow for fantasy worlds to have other gods and morals then this movie will be a lot easier to enjoy.

1650372,5,B00005QW5Y,"There are some pretty disappointed fans of the book writing here.  But, as this was my first exposure to the writer's story I was extremely impressed.  It was the first film I have seen that exposed the takeover of the Goddess religion by the patriarchal church.  There also was an attempt to bring the two strains together which I felt to be far seeing.  This is hopefully where we are headed: to a balance between the Feminine and the Masculine energies in a healthy way.  I look forward to reading the book, but I loved the film!",1428364800,2,532,4.443298969072165

1650645,1,B00005QW5Y,"You can't even call this an adaptation.  The only thing this film and book have in common are the names of the characters.  The beauty, magic, profound tragedy and majesty of the book are completely missed.",1403654400,,206,4.694444444444445
1650646,5,B00005QW5Y,"If you are expecting the book, ""Mists of Avalon"" by Marion Zimmer Bradley, Then you are bound to be disappointed. What can you stuff in a three hour presentation? Everyone has a different idea of the characters and laces.

The movie its self was an intriguing production. I especially like the inclusion of the song ""The Mystic Dream"" by Loreena McKennitt as I have many of her albums. The photography was excellent; if they make a Blu-ray version in the future I will buy it again.

We not only get a new story form the book but a few anomalies. We catch Igraine (Caroline Goodall) spinning flax with her distaff. The spinning wheel was not invented until 13th century Asia. It did not get to France until the 18th century. Author was around the fifth century.

All the actors played their parts well and did not outshine their characters.

There may have been a few liberties with the tale. However I enjoyed it to the end.

Get another take on the story with Le Morte D'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory and William Caxton.",1403222400,,1020,4.551912568306011

Extremely interesting take on the usual Camelot story - that women were the true power yielders, working often behind the scenes to set up and ensure certain things would happen, or not happen.  Loved Julianna Margulies, Joan Allen, Angelica Huston, all the women in the film - they all did a marvelous job at bringing their characters alive, and inhabiting them with power, purpose, and human frailties.  I'd love to see another film done in this vein, say, 10, 20, even 50 or 100 years later in the timeline...",1403222400,,738,4.7952755905511815

1650689,5,B00005QW5Y,"The Mists of Avalon is an updated retelling of the King Arthur legend.  What is new is the typically unrecorded female point of view.  But incorporating the feminine perspective as a whole new dimension to the often flat action-adventure myths that were handed down by generations of male story-tellers.

By re-framing the story from the points of view of the important female figures, insights, ironies, and the interplay of cross motivations spin a yarn every bit as complex and fascinating as the most elaborate Celtic braiding.  Having spent years of my life in the presence of powerful, competent, intelligent women, I think it is high time that they are credited with their potential for wisdom, intrigue, and screw-ups, just like the men.

On the whole, I find this spin on the legends to be more believable than the offerings of ""Excalibur"" or ""Merlin"", or any of a dozen other films on the subject matter.  The performances ranged from a bit stiff, to really well done.  But the overall production value is what one should expect from made-for-television mini-series.  Still, I was entertained, and given a new perspective that I personally find quite marvelous and satisfying.  I couldn't ask for more.",1402876800,,1212,5.02

1650760,5,B00005QW5Y,"I read the book, it is one of my favorites, but I also enjoyed the movie.  I have come to expect that movie makers rarely do justice to a great book the size of Mists of Avalon.  There is just too much of the book to really make a movie that will please everyone, especially in a mini series, but despite that, I found the movie acceptable.  I especially like the way they were pretty accurate in re-creating a believable atmosphere (with the exception of Camelot) of the era of King Arthur.  Fictional character or not, the historical events diplicted in the movie were accurate as were the clash between the Christian movement and the long standing ""pagan"" beliefs.

If we held every movie reproduction of a novel with the scornful intolerance I've read in the 1 star reviews, we would not be able to enjoy any book based presentations.  One needs to realize the screenwriters had an almost impossible job in re-creating this very large, detailed book that had so many profiles...I think they did a good job...the movie was well done, entertaining and filmed in beautiful country.

I think some people forget the book is a work of fiction and historical knowledge of what is called ""paganism"" is about Druidism...not Lady of the Lake and Merlin and female priestesses who live beyond the Mists of Avalon.",1392768000,12,1306,4.701754385964913

Finally, I managed to get my hand on the book and have read a number of other Zimmer-Bradley books from this series.
As someone who saw the movie first, I'll admit I'm partial to Igraine living through to see Morgaine again.
I am a bit disappointed however with the lack of Kevin/Nimue, Accolon, and even the Grail. Why cut such rich story lines???
On the upside this dvd has some extended scenes that are quite enthralling.

The movie misses it almost entirely. Arthur's sister Morgan tells us the story as if she were little more than an observer. The other women characters are one dimensional.

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

Mists of Avalon (T.V. Miniseries) - We own the DVD and watched this TNT made for T.V. movie back in 2001

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
Throw everything you know about King Arthur out the window as this Marion Zimmer Bradley epic novel turned into a T.V. miniseries refashions the legend to `dispel the lies' which we all know and love.  Viviane - The Lady of the Lake and High Priestess of the Goddess (Anjelica Huston) is charged with keeping the Old Religion alive during a period in England's history when the new faith was making serious inroads to expel any who followed the peaceful way of The Great Mother.  A series of king-making marriages are arranged beginning with Irgraine and Uther, The Great Marriage (a magical rite to bind the new king and the land) between Arthur (Edward Atterton) and a mysterious priestess, who turns out to be his half-sister, Morgaine (Julianna Margulies) much to both their surprise, and Arthur to Gwenhwyfar.  Viviane's plans are frustrated by family squabbles, ruthless rivalries, and Christian priests who seek to stamp out Goddess worship for good.  King-craft is messy business and this retelling of the famous saga seeks to show the powerful women who helped shape the age of Camelot.

Here at the Thomason Family Society for Movie Goodness we have a few rules - we do our best to not compare the MOVIE to the BOOK.  It's never fruitful because with few exceptions the book is always going to win out.  This particular book, a household favorite, is hard to keep to that restriction because of the indelible mark the book has left in our minds.  Marion Bradley's feminizing of the epic saga was so well done that it left this Movie Dude wondering if perhaps she really was `setting the record straight' and filling in the gaps in the story.  The book would earn 5 stars without a doubt, with that said...

Naturally the story has been watered down and simplified (overly simplified at times) and the production levels are what you'd expect from a good episode of Xena but the flick does get the basic story on the screen.  There is such a clear difference in the level of acting which Anjelica Huston and Julianna Margulies where able to render compared the relatively b-grade performances of the other cast members... whatever money they paid Anjelica and Julianna was money well spent for sure.  This warbling of quality is evident in the cinematography as well with some scenes showcasing some genuinely beautiful shots and others being average T.V.-esque.  One solidly built component was the soundtrack which contained a haunting ditty by Loreena McKinnett ""The Mystic's Dream"" - as a matter of fact the soundtrack was so well put together this Movie Dude bought it along with the movie (and on a side note, it might say something that the SOUNDTRACK was $5 more expensive than the MOVIE itself... hmmmmm (snicker)).  All things considered it was a valiant effort for a T.V. mini-series to undertake as I'm not sure a big budget Hollywood blockbuster could have done much better with this complex tale (but I sure would love to see them try).

One thing I loved:
<~> A genuine feeling story-line which brought a more truthful and balanced feel to the Arthurian legend

One thing I did NOT like:
<~> A script which left serious quantities of Bradley's masterpiece behind - half way through script writer Gavin Scott turned from the original and never looked back (like, a real bummer man)

1650934,4,B00005QW5Y,This was a made for TV movie and I saw it when it played the first time. Did not think I'd like it from the title and its period drama look but I was pleasantly surprised. Watched it with my mom and she also enjoyed it. The story line started out a bit slow but once the main characters grew with the story line it just took off from there. After watching it I'd classify it as more of a fantasy genre film than period.,1376611200,,419,3.9411764705882355
1650935,4,B00005QW5Y,"It was a good mini series, just as I remember seeing it on TV. Item arrived in excellent condition.

1650941,5,B00005QW5Y,"The legend of King Arthur predates recorded history, much like the Illiad & the Oddessy it was written down after years of oral telling's. This is the 6th dvd I have of the Arthurian tale's & I love them all for different reasons. When I first read the description of this movie I was a bit put off it sounded like a feminist version of the Arthur myth & I thought it would be a soften version of the story. This is not the case I was pleasantly surprised to find it has all the violent swordplay & action you would want from a sword & sorcery adventure. They did a great job depicting the original inhabitants of Briton the Celt's & Pict's & their religious beliefs. The costumes were great showing the Boar head standard's & armored warrior's wearing wolf head cloak's This is a great movie for the Arthur fans or the average sword & sorcerery fan to add to their collection's. I can't say this is my favorite version of the King Arthur mytho's but I can say I am happy to add it to my collection, Oops I forgot Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"" & The animated Disney version's I guess ""The Mist of Avalon"" makes 8 D.V.D.'s of the King Arthur Mytho's. I admit I am a certified sword & sorcery nut !!! As I also have 6 version's of the tale of Beowulf!!! Crap I also forgot ""Merlin"" & ""Merlin's apprentice"" so I guess that's 10.

Time moved on and so did I. My new husband urged me to buy it, happy to watch it with me. We watched it all the way through two days in a row at Christmastime and parts of it twice since then. I know we'll watch it several more times. It is intriguing and thought-provoking. I believe in Christ, but I have a suspicion there is more to it than what the patriarchy of the churches and governments would allow us to believe. It touches my soul.",1358035200,2,610,4.177966101694915

It is an exploration of Celtic/ Pagan religions and ancient goddess worship, with beautiful cinematography.  Great performances by  Juliana Magruiles as Morgaine, Angelica Huston as Lady of the Lake and Joan Allen as the evil Morgause.  The themes are decidedly adult -- it was nice to see a more sophisticated version of King Arthur that was not specifically 'made for kids'.

1651070,5,B00005QW5Y,"This is a great movie. Just love the story it tells, and the feeling you get when watching this movie.",1349654400,,102,4.15
1651071,4,B00005QW5Y,"The legend of King Arthur has gone through many, many permutations. The Mists of Avalon is probably one of the more unique. It tells the tale of Arthur through the point of view of the female characters. Overall, this movie works far better than most fantasy movies - certainly better than the current fantasy hit Game of Thrones.

The characters in this movie are complex and rich - or at least the female ones. Unlike most incarnations of Camelot, none of the female characters are one-dimensional. We see them suffer and cry, but we also see their strength. They're not whiners. Some of the women use sex as a tool of influence, but they never come across as whores. The actresses do a capable job portraying their characters, something that can't be said of all TV movies.

That said, the men are inherently less interesting. Arthur is a bit too callow. We barely meet the famous Merlin before he dies. Lancelot is eye candy. We don't get to know the other Knights of the Round Table at all. Mordred shows some complexity, but his character is sometimes overacted. I wouldn't say this undermines the movie too much, but it would have been nice if the movie spent a bit more time developing the male characters. Then again, at 3 hours long, this movie is already quite long.

It's worth noting how this movie uses sex. With so many strong female characters, sex inevitably comes up. This isn't a family friendly version of King Arthur. However, unlike, say, Game of Thrones, Mists of Avalon uses sex artistically, not crudely. The sex scenes are subtle but filled with emotion. I commend the director for smart choices.

My biggest critique of the film is that it doesn't have a well defined plot. The movie follows characters, not a story. I think it works, but it would have been nice to have had some sort of goal or threat giving some shape to the story. Viewers accustomed to action films will find Mists of Avalon boring.

Overall, I definitely recommend this movie for fans of fantasy movies. It probably has less resonance for viewers who aren't intimately familiar with Arthurian legend, but still has a lot for viewers who appreciate character development.",1344988800,2,2169,4.727513227513228
1651072,4,B00005QW5Y,"The legend of King Arthur has gone through many, many permutations. The Mists of Avalon is probably one of the more unique. It tells the tale of Arthur through the point of view of the female characters. Overall, this movie works far better than most fantasy movies - certainly better than the current fantasy hit Game of Thrones.

The characters in this movie are complex and rich - or at least the female ones. Unlike most incarnations of Camelot, none of the female characters are one-dimensional. We see them suffer and cry, but we also see their strength. They're not whiners. Some of the women use sex as a tool of influence, but they never come across as whores. The actresses do a capable job portraying their characters, something that can't be said of all TV movies.

That said, the men are inherently less interesting. Arthur is a bit too callow. We barely meet the famous Merlin before he dies. Lancelot is eye candy. We don't get to know the other Knights of the Round Table at all. Mordred shows some complexity, but his character is sometimes overacted. I wouldn't say this undermines the movie too much, but it would have been nice if the movie spent a bit more time developing the male characters. Then again, at 3 hours long, this movie is already quite long.

It's worth noting how this movie uses sex. With so many strong female characters, sex inevitably comes up. This isn't a family friendly version of King Arthur. However, unlike, say, Game of Thrones, Mists of Avalon uses sex artistically, not crudely. The sex scenes are subtle but filled with emotion. I commend the director for smart choices.

My biggest critique of the film is that it doesn't have a well defined plot. The movie follows characters, not a story.

1651074,4,B00005QW5Y,"It's been so long since I read the book (probably time to do it again) that I can't say how well the details stick to the original, but the overall tone is clearly what Marion Zimmer Bradley had in mind. None of the actors are famous, but they are well cast and do an excellent job of bringing this enormously complicated story to life. Now when I go back to read the book again, I will have faces to populate it for me.

The story is the traditional Arthurian legend told from the point of view of his pagan sister, whom we call Morgan le Fay and whom Bradley calls Morgaine. It would not surprise me in the least if Bradley had it right, in that she is a scholar of Celtic and other ancient cultures of the British Isles. As most of us realize, the Arthurian story sits on that borderline between fiction and fact, between myth and history.

Viviane (Anjelica Huston) is the high priestess of Avalon, an island that exists in some middle world through the mists near Glastonbury. Her underlying plan is to join the powers of the Druids to those of the Christian church, and thereby unite Britain under a specially nurtured king. That king, of course, is Arthur. Morgaine, his half-sister due to a relationship engineered by Viviane, is taken to Avalon to learn to be a priestess of the Druidic Goddess. Arthur is taken away by Merlin to be raised by his other aunt.

I'm terribly glad that the special features of the DVD include a family tree arrangement of the characters, as it is enormously complicated. At times it seems that everyone is in love with everyone else, and mostly near relatives. That most of these loves are engineered by Viviane in the name of the Goddess is clear enough, but exactly what she is up to it far less clear.

If anything, the end of this story should be a warning to those who are involved in magic that it does not pay to interfere in other people's lives and expect things to go as you planned. I'll say no more about the plot, because it really is unique and deserves to tell its own story.

The landscapes, costumes, settings and events (the Beltaine ritual being a high point) are magnificent and, as far as I know, pretty authentic to historical concepts. There's plenty of romance, battling, emotional upheavals, and details of who is lusting after whom to fill the three hours the movie takes. I cannot remember a single minute I would consider dull or irrelevant to the progress of the story.",1337126400,,2437,4.504524886877828

I'm not a historian so my knowledge of Arthur is limited but I'm sure this sensationalizes the love affair between the characters more then it's said originally.

1651077,1,B00005QW5Y,"Unfortunately, the movie production of this absolutely amazing book did not do the story justice at all!  I was sorely disappointed and got upset while watching the movie.  The director's interpretation of not only the characters, but the story as a whole, was so far from the reality of the book he blew it.

First, this book should have been made into a mini-series, not a simple couple hour movie.  This production took so many liberties with the storytelling and how the characters interacted that it put a negative slant on what the story was truly about. This story needs all the background information on the characters to make you truly in tune with who they are and why they behave as they do.  There were some scenes altered so horribly that it completely ruined the plot, not to mention things in the movie that never happened in the book!

The actresses did a wonderful job, but some were terribly mis-cast. Viviane and Morgaine were slight and small, not tall and majestic as the actresses in the movie. Yes, the costumes were gorgeous, but not realistic either.  The priestesses of Avalon wore simple un-dyed or blue linen, not all the colorful and elaborate dresses shown.  They made Raven look freakish and slightly off, too.  Also, this adaptation made Viviane out to be cold, calculating and uncaring, while in reality yes, she could be quite controlling, but the director never carried the story far enough to make you understand what actually drove her to her actions. She sacrificed here entire life to keep Avalon alive and a part of the world, fighting against the manipulative priests of the church who denounced as evil and wrong all religions that did not conform to their beliefs.

Igraine was a strong character in the book, not a bumbling, indecisive fool as portrayed; and while Morgause was always power hungry, she was not the evil black sorceress as shown in the movie. As far as Arthur and the rest of the men, the director did not even break the surface of developing their amazing characters with all their inner torment between right and wrong, loyalty, friendship, etc. Mordred  was not constantly full of hate and pure evil, but the movie made him look like Satan himself.

Overall, I would have to say this movie ruined the book, but I am so glad that I actually read the real story of The Mists of Avalon instead of relying on what the movie showed.  Honestly, if a director and producer cannot keep to the story as written, they should not cut corners and re-tell the story the way they see fit. I would give the producers and directors a D for their efforts, and the only reason it isn't an F is because the scenery and costumers were beautiful.",1330128000,2,2688,4.669491525423729
1651078,4,B00005QW5Y,"I loved the movie version of Mists of Avalon and watched it the weekend I got it.  I read the book many years ago, as I am very interested in the Arthurian legends.
The movie shows how Britian changed from Druid to Christian during Arthur's reign as well as the story of Arthur, Morgaine/Morgana/Morgan La Fey and their son Modred.  Very detailed with each character including Lancelot, Guenivere, Uther and Ingraine.

Mists of Avalon is told from the women's point of view, and the only thing that didn't ring true was how much Morgaine and Vivienne were able to travel in what was really a very brutual time for everyone.  Their characters were very strong women and that is what the writer wanted in the book, and it came through in the movie.

1651132,1,B00005QW5Y,"I have read ""Mists of Avalon"" almost yearly since it first was published.  I had not seen the movie made from the book, and so, after reading it again this spring decided to treat myself.

After watching this DVD I feel the producers and directors took a giant cleaver, chopped Marion Zimmer Bradley's book into pieces, threw the pieces in the air and without reverence or thought pieced them back together again to create a made for television farce.

I realize how daunting it might be to put such an epic novel to the television screen, but they might have tried to at least stay true to the story as written!  I do not know what the screen writers hoped to accomplish, or what audience they were writing to capture.

I, like the women of Avalon, am a daughter of the Goddess.  And, I was appalled by the treatment given the book from which the movie was made.  The book, ""The Mists of Avalon"", pays homage and tribute to the Goddess, her mysteries and her priestesses.  The movie gives a Disney like feeling to what was written in the book.  No, I think Disney would have been more respectful and true to the written word! In talking with others, of like mind, about the movie we wonder if the screen writers were pandering to a largely fundamental Christian audience and wanted to skirt the more beautiful and devout pagan aspect of the story.

I could begin listing inadequacies of this movie as it tries to capture ""The Mists of Avalon"", but they are too many.  The only way this movie is even remotely connected to Marion Zimmer Bradley's book is in the title and the naming of the central characters.  And, even that becomes rather loose and recreated by the screen writer.  Very bothersome was the way the sequence of events, from their childhood to the inevitable conclusion, was seemingly ignored. Events that happen at the beginning were shelved to the end, or completely ignored.  Too many important aspects of the main characters lives were excluded to give any continuity to the story.  I found myself often rewinding and asking ""whaaa"", and not finding the answer, because some vital information had been excluded.

The actresses chosen to play the lead women are strong and powerful actors, whom I admire, and they did as well as could be expected with what they were given.  I would have liked to see what such strong women might have done with a screen writer and director who followed the book!  The main male actors were weak and I do not feel they were not given much to work with in the way of character development.  We all have ""pictures"" in our head of the characters in a novel.  These men, for me, were not even close!

I have seen mini series made that take weeks to air.  It would have done well to stretch ""The Mists of Avalon"" over many more weeks and present the story as written.

All in all, it was a very disappointing movie, because I wanted to SEE ""The Mists of Avalon"" brought to life.  Perhaps another day another director, producer and screen writer will try again and stay true to the written word, and see the beauty of keeping the movie sequentially true to the story.",1306454400,5,3113,4.547576301615799
1651133,4,B00005QW5Y,"I had first seen this on television and was really surprised at how good it was. Then I decided to buy the dvd years later and watch it again. I had the book for a few years and one day needing something to read there it was. I had a great time reading this. The characters were so full blown and I actually came to care about them. The relationship between Lacelet and Arthur, Guenivere and Morgaine. Sometimes you'd like Morgaine other times not. Morgause was a little more complex. Great fun these women and then there was Kevin who was not in the movie. Such a rich character. All in all a great movie and still greater read.

Although strong and irrational feelings are very much a part of this movie, they are shown quickly and as part of the plot. The one thing that I didn't like about this movie was the odd pagan culture of Avalon, which could be a bit over-dramatic and silly at times. Another strange quirk about the story is that there is always a special reason that forces the characters to make love, which seems a bit too fanciful but makes for an interesting plot that is so enjoyably complicated that I consider it close to Shakespeare in greatness. The acting was superb except for the last bad guy, but no big deal.

A film would have to be a good twenty hours to even hope to encompass enough of the story to be comprehensive, and needs to be done by a woman so the perspective does not get so skewed as it did in the making of this film.  The movie is nothing like the book, and some of the characters could have been cast much better, not to mention the women in the film came across with much less strength in character than in the book.  If you look at the movie as a movie by itself with no relation to the book, it is decent, but so much was changed and left out from what is in the book that the film really ends up being a completely different, and deficient, story overall.",1297468800,,856,4.017647058823529

1651167,4,B00005QW5Y,"You know, I loved movie - which I was attracted to when I was younger, trying to escape Christian child/torture/sacrifice/woman-hating stuff I was raised with. I was thrilled with the Goddess themes which was like medicine for a young woman being insulted and abused by male supremacists for a long while. I wonder sometimes if we escape one predator wolves to fall into the hands of predatory bears however.

As a story or fantasy it's lovely - high adventure, the magic, priestesses of Avalon, sisterhood of Goddess worshippers - fighting for power while threatened by a male-dominated, aggressive Christian take-over, seemingly a dream come true for a secret Goddess worshipper. As I've gotten older and seen horrific abuses of women, children, animals in both pagan, Christian and many religious traditions I become more leary and horrified by religion each passing year. Jonestown, my own suffering at the hands of Christians, education about many religious animal torture and human sacrificial rituals worldwide has just turned me off big time. While I still love this story for Deep Play and fantasy, there's an element to it that repels me and that's the scene where Morgaine is tricked into a religious ceremony where she is to have sex with the ""stag King"" - not only do they kill a stag - symbolic of killing everything that's ""dear"" to you - deer, get it (as well as dear to the deer!)? They also kill all that's dear to our heroine, because they trick her into having sex with her own brother! Which not only amounts to rape, but is a trauma she'll probably never get over. It has come to my attention that many religions are abusing children's trust in horrific manners in real life and we need to really check this cruelty. Emotional and mental torture and anguish is some of the worst you can go through. To have your own sisters and mother harm you this way is..... I don't know that it's possible to get over it. It's child abuse at it's worst. Though Morgaine is of age at this point, she is still in these women's trust. I've had something similar happen to me and we must fight religion used as physical, mental or emotional abuse. You can't imagine the anguish, it's indescribable. Secret sects, religious groups etc... all are potential predators no different from rapists or child predators. I really wish that religion could be regulated in terms of regulating breaking laws with religious excuses which seems to be the case in many religions - strange how what's against the law, suddenly becomes acceptable in a religion, like child abuse, rape etc...

Having said that, this story, purely for entertainment or pretend is still one of my all time favorites, unlike a lot of readers I liked the movie adaptation, I thought Morgaine was beautiful, Angelica Houston was really good in her role, and all the sisters were good. The costumes were great, a scene or two specifically on Avalon itself could've been better designed set-wise, special effects, etc....  but all in all. The music was well chosen and I enjoyed the experience of watching it. Occasionally it has the cheesy feel of old sword and sorcery movies, but the scenes with the sisters and mother make up for it. The music is haunting and beautiful. The magical elements of aspects of animism, moral truths in nature etc.... although the worship of predators is always inherently immoral, tribal religious people have always tried to sort out reality by sorting out and deifying/copying natural elements. It's natural for primates to learn this way, because we are natural mimics. I hope we can grow beyond this because Nature is actually less a mother and more a brutal pyramid scheme of predation. I also have doubts to whether, you can choose conveniently between cruelty and kindness whenever it suits you. I hated when one priestess succumbed and became a nun at the end of the movie, but probably realistic. It was done poetically though, with a sad melancholy at the loss of the ""Old Ways."" They're not really lost however, people still practice all sorts of religious freedoms and usually go underground when Christians begin to torture them etc...",1296259200,2,4144,4.858557284299859

1651172,5,B00005QW5Y,"I have read the amazing and sprawling epic by Marion Zimmer Bradley, on which this movie is based.
I believe that despite deviations from the novel, which would be impossible to avoid given the scope of the novel and its many characters, angles, events and turns, the movie is the most engrossing and best of the movies yet made based on Arthurian legend.
It centers on Morgaine (Juliana Margulies-enchanting and perfect for the role) , Arthur's dark and bewitching half-sister. Unlike many versions , she is given a sympathetic portrayal here. She is determined to preserve the legacy of Avalon and it's pagan religion , against the growing Christian faith.

It succeeds in capturing the magic of Avalon, the passions and turmoil of the main characters, the wonder that was Celtic Briton and the conflicts between Chritianity and the Ancient Paganism.
Brilliant casting and effects. A stunning visual presentation.
You will be spellbound by the Celtic magic rights, the visions of Morgaine , the swordplay and battle scenes, and the costumes.
Sop poignantly captured are the young Morgaine's (Tamsin Egerton)first vision and the terror she experiencing, her parting from her brother when they are both taken by the high priestess Viviane (Anjelica Huston) from their mother Igraine (Caroline Goodall), Morgaine;s turmoil at finding out the man she made love to as part of the pagan ceremonies organized by Merlin and Viviane was her brother Arthur, the reunion of Morgaine with her mother outside Glastonbury Abby, and the murder by Mordred of Viviane.
The evil of the soreceress Morgause (Joan Allen), the villainy of Mordred (Hans Matheson), the majesty of Arthur (Edward Atterton), the gallantry of Lancelot (Michael Vartan) and the turmoil of  Gwenhwyfar (played by the sensual Samantha Mathis) are brilliantly captured.

1651173,2,B00005QW5Y,"I remember watching this 9 years ago on TV when it premiered. At that time I had just finished the book and was in love with the story. It disappointed me then. I just re watched it and when I would have given it 1 star 9 years ago, I give it 2 now. I realize 2 stars is not much of a rating, and if I were not comparing it to the book, perhaps I'd give it 3 stars.

There are many problems with this film, such as missing characters, change in plot, actors chosen to play characters. I think Anjelica Huston, Julianna Marguiles, and Joan Allen are all very good actresses. Their spirits do fit those of the characters, but other than Julianna, I don't feel any of them really look the part. Vivianne is a short woman, who has Faerie blood in her, Morgaine as well. In the novel, they are never considered necessarily beautiful, except to those who love them, or when they empower the Goddess.

There was no Kevin the Harper. That disappointed me a lot, because he was very important to the story.

I understand this was a movie made for TV, but I think a story such as ""The Mists of Avalon"" deserves an HBO adaptation, or a Showtime adaptation, if not a full length film. The story can be done right in the limited time allowed. The way I see it is, if ""The Lord of the Rings"" can be adapted into beautiful films (despite their changes), then there is no reason ""The Mists of Avalon"" cannot.

I do suggest, that if you plan to read the book, do so before watching the film. There is much more depth and it fills in a lot of blanks. It's also more emotionally driven.",1287187200,,1567,4.213333333333333

It also made me think what if the Saxons would not have succeeded in their conquest of The Briatain Islands...Will we ever overcome this urgent instinct of territoriality, simply grabing disregarding prior rights or occupancy? All this surrounded by this sense of overcoming power by the force of love and spiritual prevalescence untainted by the hand of Man.

I had forgotten it until I ran across it while skimming through Amazon. 9 years later, I have the DVD. This movie is full of adventures, conspiracies, magic, religious battles between the ""Old Way"" and Christianity.

At one point, the future King Arthur is in a burning building with his dying father. He father dies, then he calls on the Goddess of the Earth and the God of the Heavens. His sister, Morgaine, had told him as a child that he could serve both higher powers. Well, when he asked for assistance to save his life, it's very telling of ""which"" higher power answered. If you've never seen this movie, you might be quite surprised. It is certainly something worth starting a discussion over. Great purchase. I'm thinking of making the Merlin movie (if I can find it)a part of my King Arthur collection: this movie, Excalibur, and Merlin.",1264723200,4,968,4.627906976744186
1651236,2,B00005QW5Y,"Let me start by saying, I like this film but only on it's own. It's NOT the book - not by a long shot - and I'm surprised they were even able to call it ""The Mists of Avalon."" So many flaws! Where to start! Viviane killed by the wrong person entirely. Igraine alive when she should be dead. Actually, Morgaine hated Arthur when they were little. No Kevin the Bard. No Nimue. No faeries (the book has faeries). No mention of dragons. No mention of Atlantis. No magical sheath. No giants. Handles Christianity with kid gloves. And not enough sex.

Look, I'll make this simple for you. What more could a movie ask for?! WAR. SEX. VIOLENCE. SEX. LUST. VIOLENCE. MAGIC. SEX. PAGANISM VS. CHRISTIANITY. VIOLENCE. CAMELOT. SEX. AVALON. VIOLENCE. DRAGONS. SEX. GIANTS. VIOLENCE. FAERIES. SEX. ATLANTIS. AND SEX. Oh... and spirituality. Oh... and personal struggles. Oh... and women rock. Who couldn't sell that movie!?!?!?!

Is that the movie they made? No. Absolutely not. THAT movie wouldn't have to be made for TV. And since The Mists of Avalon is a HUGE work, you could easily make an attention-grabbing trilogy out of it on the scale of The Lord of the Rings. I'm still waiting for THAT movie. The problem is that so much of the casting for THIS movie was well done. All of the main female characters were perfectly cast (IF! you ignore the changing or ignoring of the characters ages), even if poorly directed with a crap script. Uther and Accolon were also very well cast though not given enough attention in my opinion. And... you will never get that cast again in another version. I adore Anjelica Huston but she's just too old to play Viviane again. Even Julianna Margulies couldn't reprise her role as Morgaine.

This movie is basically only useful when you're craving a certain mood/theme because it's hard to get anywhere else. Like it or not, Pagans are the fastest growing religious group in the country and we want good films that aren't just fantasy but really speak to a Pagan's soul. Maybe someone smart will make a proper version of this film some day. Until then, read the book. You'll be glad you did.",1258502400,3,2115,4.664879356568365

I counted down the days and even through a party to celebrate the first night of the mini-series. And, from that first night on, I was terribly disappointed. The actresses do NOT capture the spirit of their characters. Angelica Huston's Viviane is cold and very nearly mean, so unlike Viviane in the book. The spirit and meaning of the book were completely lost in this mini-series. I would not recommend it to anyone. If you haven't read the book, READ IT! Don't watch this. And if you have read the book, don't watch this because you will be sorely disappointed. A pathetic re-telling of Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece.",1252195200,4,782,4.7153284671532845

Morgan Le Fay is usually portrayed as an evil sorceress who tricks Arthur into committing incest with her and then has a child who ultimately kills Arthur.

But in this story, she is an innocent and is known as Morgaine le Faye.  It is her story.  She tells of the treachery of Vivienne, Lady of the Lake and priestess to Avalon along with Merlin.  They conspire to have the child ,Arthur, born of Uther, a believer in the Old Ways, which they desperately want to preserve so Avalon can be safe from disappearing for good. Then, they commit an abomination against both Arthur and Morgaine is the pursuit of their quest. But, I will not give that information away.  You'll have to watch to find out how.
 Before this and during the whole movie are her good times as well as bad. She tells of how she was separated from her parents and her brother at a young age so that they might begin their educations and separate lives.  She falls in love with the Sisterhood of the Goddess and becomes a priestess.  By then, the magic of Avalon has done some damage and continues through the lives of Lancelot, Guineviere and all in Camelot.
By the way, the soundtrack is incredible!!

The Mists of Avalon is a mixed-bag of a film that sometimes achieves a high level of audience investment in the characters, but at other times showcases the poor direction and hokeyness that have come to define ""TV Movies""; it's mainly interesting so you should check it out if you like King Arthur stories, but don't expect art.",1236124800,,347,4.688524590163935
1651284,3,B00005QW5Y,"How often do you see a movie adapted from a book you've read and liked, and walked away disappointed?  That is almost always the case, and this is no exception.  I thought the movie had good potential, but you cannot squeeze 876 pages that span years into a three hour movie. Needless to say too much was left out and too much was changed.  For example, at the beginning of the book Morgaine is a very small child.  She appears to be around 10 or 11 at the beginning of the movie and doesn't age one bit from this point until Arthur is 6 and they leave their parents!  The child who played young Morgaine was perfect for the role.  They just should have found someone younger for the beginning scenes.  Speaking of people not aging, Morgause was supposed to be a teenager in the beginning, but in the movie she appeared to be about 25.  She never aged either.  Igraine was just plain weird and Uther was not the handsome knight one would imagine.  Also, I was really jarred by the appearance of Raven.  She looked like someone from another planet(seriously).

If you expect a good retelling of the book, this is simply not it.  Since it was only loosley based on the book, this movie might just as well have been any old retelling of the Arthur legend .  As a matter of fact, one might want to watch the movie and then read the book since the movie doesn't give much of the book away.  If nothing more, it might be a good introduction to Arthurian legend and the book.  That doesn't mean it wasn't somewhat entertaining.  The scenery was beautiful and I loved Julianna Marguilies as Morgaine.  I had nothing better to do Saturday night and it was a decent way to kill a little time.

Originally a TV  mini-series on TNT when watched without commercials holds your attention fairly well. It tells the story of King Arthur from a woman's perspective. And not only that put tells it from a pagan woman's perspective. Something not often done.

The acting here was pretty ok. It wasn't anything outstanding, but it wasn't horrible either. The plot of the story can kind of get you confused if you don't really know the story of Arthur that well, and there are some who don't. The costumes are a bit...out there are some points, but this movie isn't trying to be historical, but more of a fantasy with a semi-historical setting.

I mean really! Just where do they get off by totally changing almost everythin that was/is contained in the book, into what was/is presented??? I'd sure like to know.

Although, I do applaud all the actors involved. Givren what they were given, they truly triumphed. And I do agree with the other poster on the ""Heighth Issue"", except, my research into this issuue, has led me to think/know, that they weren't ""Fariy"" born, but rather ""Elven, or remanants of the Tuattha de Dannan, which ruled Western Briton, Scotland, and Wales, long after theie immigration from Atlantis (which cntinued as Avalon, in several locales in the Britiish Isles, on/in a bridge between the 3'rd and 4th Densitys/Dimensions), and after their expulsion from Ireland, both befoor, during, and after the Roman occupation. Avalon being aligned with The Goddess, and the Temples of Isis, was spared and embraced by the Romans, yet reviled by the early Christian Church authorities. And Avalon was aslso a place of refuge for some of the more circumspect Druids, as well as a protectorate of the Picts, against the romans... Which is alluded to in MZB's book, as the Lady of the Lake, freely crosses Hadrian's Wall, whenever she goes to the Orkney's, and to, but not mentioned by MZB, Avalon's sattellite locale in the Allan Water's area of Stirlingshire, Scotland.",1222041600,2,1615,5.022388059701493

1651325,3,B00005QW5Y,"To be honest, I did not think that 3 hours could encompass the incredible depth and complexity of Bradley's masterwork.  But I got this out of curiosity and because my kids would probably enjoy it.  I am sorry to report that this film barely sufficed to hold my interest - I constantly thought back with disappointment to the book I read (and vividly remember from) nearly 20 years ago, which had phenomenal character development and covered every aspect the Arthur myth from a new point of view.  Nonetheless, I feel that this film requires a careful review on its own.

The theme of the story is the collision of two religions, one the pagan earth goddess and the other christian monotheism.  Morgaine, long portrayed as an evil heathen, is the most sympathetic actor in this version, both a victim of political machination and also a fighter to preserve the old religion.  Julianna Margulies is a truly wonderful Morgaine, too beautiful perhaps, but she really gets the character.  The problem is that the film if too short to chart her evolution, from acolyte to rebel to leader, all the time recognizing the tragedy as it unfolds so inexorably.  The same can be said of Huston, who is a wonderful Viviane (ruthless, loving, desperate, majestic), and Allen as the cold and ambitious Morgause.  The only way they could have succeeded would have been to triple the time of the film.  The film also succeeds in placing the men on the side - less aware of the forces at play than as men of action.  The male actors, all of whom are lesser known than the three female stars, are all very good.

That being said, as it progresses, the film is less and less faithful to the novel, again in part because it has to truncate the plots, shrink back the themes, and eliminate characters.  For example, in the book, Merlin is succeeded by a crippled musician who becomes Morgaine's lover for years; he then concludes that the religion is finished, hands over the pagan chalice that is transmogrified into the holy grail in a transcendently sad scene of religious vision, and his punishment is death.  That is such a rich episode that you could make an entire film just of that.  There is another scene in the book that I recall, in which Mordred and Lancelot duel in a tournament, which exhausts and humiliates the aging Lancelot, signaling a passage that the witnesses instantly recognize.  Again, this kind of character development is impossible in the short time available.

In the end,  I would recommend this version to those who have not read the book - but only as way to get them to read the book.",1217030400,9,2596,4.668131868131868
1651326,2,B00005QW5Y,The first half of the movie was great and followed the book pretty well. Unfortunately I realized that it had only covered about the first quarter of the book. Ted Turner obviously decided to solve the problem by completely changing the ending and thus the entire tone of the movie. If Bradley were alive I'm sure she'd be very disappointed in what was done to her book. The actors were not at fault and did a credible job but the writers should be hung. This should have been at least an eight to twelve part mini series not a three parter. It's a shame someone with a little more intelligence like Peter Jackson hadn't gotten the movie rights instead of Ted Turner. This man produces nothing but pablum. Bradley's book is every bit as great a novel as The Lord of the Rings and it deserved as good a treatment in the movie. That's what happens when an egomaniac decides he knows what's best.

I had hoped that my residual bitterness took a hike and I could watch the series again without getting completely upset, but that's probably not going to happen, so...
Okay, first thing's first: I realize that not everyone who has seen this movie/series has read the book... but when I say 'the book is better', it's a complete understatement. Really, the book is leagues better than this...production.
The movie would have been good would it have had some decency for the book itself, because the book was a good story, and the series was not. I don't even know where to start with my whining complaints. Casting? Fine. Morgause, a fourteen year-old girl, being played by Joan Allen ? Are you kidding me? I love Joan Allen, but she is not a young woman. Joan Allen looked older as Morgause than Igraine. Anjelica Huston was actually great, in my opinion, as Viviane, though she didn't 'look' like the book's Viviane. But she was kept somewhat weak and in the background. Her bond with Morgaine did not show. In fact, Morgaine's character in the series was more attached to Igraine, which is so WRONG. It just defeats the purpose of the tale. It's not just one thing, the whole production is full of these holes. Some may call it a 'artistic license'. I call it complete and utter disrespect and disregard FOR the artist.
The book supposed to be all about the female perspective of the Arthurian tale. As I said before, it's not historically accurate, but it's fun to read, and a great story.
But there's been someone doing some serious done snipping here with this project...where is Kevin the bard? Where is Nimue? Where is Niniane? Where is ...stop me now...
I can't stop though.
The blatant disregard for the book really angers me. Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote a great book. Not a historical book. It was a fantasy, and it was very sympathetic to the Druids, and critical of 'early' Christianity. It wasn't a historically accurate book, but it was a very engaging one because of the complexity of each character, and because of the masterful epic intrigue it provided. The movie/series is completely stripped of intrigue, and it looks like it was done on a shoestring budget. Every penny seems to have spent on costumes (which were quite beautiful) and music (also beautiful), but a few more ounces would've made a coherent, interesting story...as it is, the way it is now, the series is a complete joke. And I am not laughing.
There are just far too many reasons to list as to why I was not satisfied. Others have pointed it out, I can't. I'd never shut up.

In contrast, this TV Film version makes many changes with characters, settings, timelines, and is dark in nature and appearance.

The first blow comes in the cheesy production values overrunning the film, from the camera work (zooming in close ups when Igraine meets Uther), sets (mostly soundstage, nothing like the book describes), costumes (sparkly baby-blue robes and dangly earrings for Viviane, who never would have worn such things), and music (New Age-y for Avalon, strings and drums all over the place otherwise). If that weren't bad enough, the movie takes out so much of the story--and leaves in such an altered version of basic events and character traits--that it's nearly unrecognizable from the novel. Several of the performances are good, and in certain moments the movie faithfully represents the book--like when Morgaine is given in marriage to Uriens and not Accolon--but they are vastly outnumbered by the many re-writings and omissions in the plotline.

I disagree with other reviewers who wrote it was an ""introduction"" to the book. I would never have read the book if I'd seen this first. It's admittedly a tall order to turn a nearly 900-page masterpiece spanning 50 or 60 years into a three hour movie, but I can't even give this an A for Effort.

If another mini-series of ""The Mists of Avalon"" is made (and a remake is desperately needed), it sould be made by the BBC who never fail to maintain a high level of authenticity and quality in their 'books on TV' miniseries.  The screenwriter should be the same guy who wrote the screenplay for the first Harry Potter book -- stick to the book and be authentic with the actors and production.

This Turner version plays like half bad battle movie and half bad soap opera, which is really sad because the original story (MZB's book) has so much potential.

But the story is only based on the Arthurian legends...much has been twisted or changed, the most obvious being that it portrays Morgana as the poor girl who is taken advantage of at every turn, though she is in the original (Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur) one of Arthur's main enemies.  The story being told from Morgana's perspective would have been a great idea, if she had remained the wicked foe she used to be.  It is not really boring, but nevertheless very lacking.

I'm only one hundred pages into it now and I'm telling you this is one of the best versions of the King Arthur legend that there are. I know; I attempted to read the unabridged version of ""Le Morte De Arthur"" and it sucks. Perhaps if there's an abridged version out there it would be better but I'm not even going to bother boring myself with it. Bradley's writing comes from years of research into the Arthurian Legend so she could probably be considered an expert on the field. As is true of most movies which are based upon books it is always the same, the movie sucks compared to the book. It'll probably be the same with my book, ""Tamara's Journey: The Purging Of A Tyrant"" when it comes out in film. Anyway, if you've seen the dvd and you thirst for more information as any true minded soul does then by all means get the book. It's 876 pages but don't let that scare you. It will take a little time to read it but it'll be well worth it. Then you can get her other Avalon series books and then there's a few books she wrote about Atlantis too.

While I have loved the Arthurian tales all my life, and particularly the stories of Malory in all the grand knightly language, I enjoyed delving more deeply into the complex female characters and their struggle to endure.

This movie introduced me to two people who have led me to things I'm passionate about.  The first is Juliana Margulies, who, as a miscast and lacking Morgaine (I still love her in this movie), led me to ER.  The earlier seasons (the only ones I watch), featuring her as the well-cast and well-acted Carol Hathaway are my favourite bits of television.  The second person probably changed my life.  That would be Loreena McKennitt, whose enchanting song 'The Mystic's Dream' is featured in this movie.  To make a long story short, her music is one with my soul, and I can't help but thank this movie for completing me.

Anyway, this is a miscast and lacking movie that has infectious qualities and is based on the most wonderful book I've ever read.  Read the book.  Love it.  Watch the movie.  Scoff at how little it follows the book.  Learn to laugh at it and love it for what it is.  Good times will certainly ensue.",1187654400,,1130,4.355769230769231

As was the actress who portrayed Morgaine (Morgan, Morgan Le Fey, Morgana, and many other names she is known by in legend), the sister of King Arthur.

1651474,1,B00005QW5Y,"Where do I begin?

I had just finished reading the book.  Marion Zimmer Bradley produced a masterpiece.  It is the tale of the Arthurian legends told from the women's perspective.  It also brings to the fore what most medieval stories won't broach - the transition from pagan beliefs to christianity.  I was very happy that this, along with the women's viewpoint was tackled.  Unfortunately, the movie failed to deliver.

In the book, there were a lot of subtle details that the author included.  They all had a reason.  For instance, Vivian and Morgaine, both of fairy ancestry, should be shorter than most people, not taller, as with the movie.  Also, the women of Avalon, when riding abroad, wear men's breeches.  There's a reason for this.  Morgause is not an evil sorceress.  Neither is Mordred an evil person.  The term Merlin is a title, not a name.  The priestesses of Avalon do not dress in gaily colored clothes.  The sacred well is actually sacred, and not to be treated like some weathered magical artifact. There are numerous other details, others not so subtle that have either been altered or cut out altogether.

I agree with a previous poster about how the true victims were the actors and actresses of this movie.  The scriptwriter probably had to acquiese to either the producer, director, or studio managmenet.  How else could any writer, novice or professional, think to leave out or change some of the most important parts of the story?  Nothing worked.  Not the love between Igraine and Uther.  Not the love between Lancelot and Guenivere.  Not Arthur's love for Guinevere and his companions.  Not Morgaine's love for Lancelot.  Not Viviane's commitment to the Goddess.  Not the Merlin's or Raven's devotion.  Not the sanctity of the Beltane rites.  Not the sacredness of Excalibur, of the Holy Regalia of Avalon.  Not even Mordred's inner conflicts.  He's not evil, only conflicted.  Imagine being the son of the High King and not being acknowledged for it because some priests consider it heresy.  Imagine the pain the High priestess of Avalon, the Lady of the Lake, had to endure in order to keep Avalon alive.  The ""solo"" passage through the mists should have been the culmination and greatest test for any priestess.  Lastly, who in their right mind would change the ending to any great book?  That is the utmost in presumptuousness.

I am very dissappointed with this movie.  Many points and details in the story have either been changed or altered.  I do not blame any of the actors or actresses.  They did their best for such a mediocre production.  Like the Lord of the Rings, Marion Zimmer Bradley's adaptation of the Arthurian legends should have been broken up into three separate movies, each about three hours long.  Maybe then can we all  truly enjoy the story of The Mists of Avalon.

This movie was not The Mists of Avalon.  It is a different story altogether.  How I wish I hadn't seen this under the pretext of MZB's book.  If you truly want to enjoy this story, please read the book instead.  This movie may have been made for TNT, but that doesn't excuse it's poor quality.  We should never lower our expectations for any story.  We should hold storytellers, print or film, to the highest standards.

I've read the book, and loved it each time. Yes, the first time i saw this i remember thinking "" Egad this is all messed up!"" The main dtails from the book are still basically still there.

What I Liked:Julianna Margulies was a great choice as Morgaine. I've heard several people say she's too attractive to be Morgaine, and that she doesnt age at all, whereas at least the other actors in the movie are made to age. In the book, it was remarked several times that she and Viviane were of the Fairie people, and they don't age until one day, they just suddenly appear old. Also, i think that was used to set Morgaine apart from the others.

Theother actors seemed well chosen, except for a few.

My gripes:Viviane. Her motives, to me, seemed a tad unclear sometimes. Angelica Huston is a good actress, but sometimes you didn't get the sense she was a prietess who would sacrifice everything for Avalon. Could be the scriptwriters fault though.

Joan Allen: personally, as Morgause was supposed to be 14 when the story started, she should have been used as Morgause got older, and a younger woman earlier in the film. I guess that was done so as not to confuse viewers?

1651491,5,B00005QW5Y,"I was absolutely entranced with this movie when it aired on television and read the book soon after. Having studied Arthurian legend in college, I found Morgaine's version refreshing and far more absorbing than some of the rather dry tales I read in school. While the female perspective of the story shifts the meaning of some of the events, I found it far more striking that this version brings Christianity's squelching of the Old Religion to the forefront. This may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with nature based faiths. Those who have studied or practice these religions will spot this immediately.  Although Viviane has let power go to her head and misuses that power, other glimpses into the practices of herbalism, shamanism and divination are quite accurate. The film also portrays Arthur as quite the marshmallow, a side of him that had not struck me so strongly in other tales.

The acting is flawless, the scenery is beautiful and the story is one to get lost in.  Although it is told in a different voice, it still contains all of the juicy elements we love in medieval tales.

I highly recommend reading the book after seeing the movie, if you haven't read it yet. After seeing the movie, you'll understand the 900-plus pages better and will be able to visualize the story.",1132963200,4,1302,4.747787610619469

Now, the movie was marketed as a look the legends from the female perspective, but this is a tad understating it.  In fact, the movie suggests that it was in fact the female characters in the whole spiel that were the key figures.  Needless to say, some of the females who traditionally had certain negative attributes are in fact not all that bad after all, and it's only because of the workings of certain corrupting males that they happen to do bad things.  I'm sure this is the reason why the movie (and I suppose the book, which I haven't read) is seemingly so popular among females.  But while the traditionally bad female characters have been vindicated, interestingly enough the whole story hinges on one female's--Vivien, the head godess--ruthless attempt to save Avalon from the onslaught of the Saxons and their male-dominated religious belief, Christianity.  For the head-goddess of a belief system that is supposedly more peaceful and egalitarian, she doesn't conduct herself in all that pleasant of a manner; she ruins lives through manipulation and coercion, and if anything, actually assures the demise of the belief system that she cherishes so dearly.  Evidently it doesn't occur to her that in the course of her ""doing everything"" in her power to perserve the old ways, it's men who are expected to do the fighting; there are no female warriors in this story, and no indication that the women were even inclined to take up arms for the cause.

The absence of certain less plot-crucial characters in an epic's transition from page to screen is understandable, but rewriting the course of events is unforgiveable.

Clearly some folks here are simply too young and have grown up with a lot of really poor quality television programming and made for TV movies which are just plain BAD.

Excalibur was one of the best films to come out that decade and is now a timeless classic. It was extremely well done and if you'd check out all the reviews on that movie, you will see it garnered almost top ratings, unlike Mists of Avalon. Excalibur is plainly a much superior film in direct comparison.

I haven't read the book, but imagine the book would be far better than the film as the book was written by an excellent author!

Merlin was also an ""ok"" movie. But again, it came across as a slightly cheesy made for TV movie. All in all, I thought is was fairly entertaining.

Just because he was afraid it was his fault that the Queen couldn't have children.

So. I wouldn't say having the Queen sleep with your best Knight was the way to go. Especially as Quinevere was allegedly supposed to have been burned at the stake for the accusations thrown at her for sleeping with Lancelot. Its horrible the way history will be distorted all for hearthrobs.

The sets are decent although most of the water scenes are done using green screen technology and unfortunately it shows. The cast is well chosen and the women's costumes are done very beautifully. I would LOVE to see this movie portrayed on the BIG screen as there would be a lot more depth to the overall production and maybe it would be closer to the original story line.

It would seem that many of the reviewers here lose sight of the fact that this is an ADAPTION of a book that is nearly 900 pages in length--too long to squeeze into a 3 hour miniseries on cable. It was bound to have plot re-writes due to the time constraints. This movie does well as a stand-alone but I would highly encourage people to read the book as well, as it covers more ground and gives more insight into the characters.

As for the ""incest"" (Morgaine and Arthur are only half-siblings) aspect to this movie, many people don't realize that in some ancient cultures, cultivating the purity of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance, it guaranteed that there would be no dilution.

The brief glimpses of deity worship and Sabbat celebrations in this movie should not be used as a true gauge by which to judge Goddess/Celtic/Druid practices.

Not to say the worshipers of the goddess come off any better, what with their prediliction for causing in-family breeding abominations and such, but at least the goddess answers sometimes. It's all about the women in this turgid feminist fantasy.

The one who doesn't reckognize that magnificent masterpiece as THE, Ultimate, and basically ONLY real film about Arthur (worthy of mentioning at least), gotta be dumb, def and blind and probably insane as well!

The Mists of Avalon is a TV-film. That about says it all. It's decent... and even if the actors or directing is spectacular (which I can't remember that it was), that really wouldn't matter, cause it just doesn't have that ""magic"" or ""power"" of a cinema-movie, nor the positive aspects that a longer running authentic TV-SERIES could have.

This is just in the middle, like all other films of this kind (Hallmark etc.) - it's their curse: They don't matter, can't be taken too seriousely and will not be remembered (except for by die-hard fans who have nothing else but these realizations to cling onto).

As for King Arthur, anyone who LOOKS FORWARD for a Jerry Bruckenheimer production gotta be truly stupid, mindless or merely extremely superficial in his/her taste of films.

For being a JB-production, it actually wasn't too bad, that one. The theory that inspired the story was serious and interesting (and very probable in my opinion), but the script itself was pretty thin, sure Kiera Knightley (or however you spell it) was great, and Stellan was cool as the Saxon chief, and they actually tried to make it authentic with the Woads speaking their old toungue etc. but it has nothing on the original: EXCALIBUR (!!!), neither does THIS film.

I haven't read the book(s), but I don't think I would be too impressed by the film if I had (thinking of how popular the books are they can't be too bad) - I'd probably just watch it cuz I was happy they had made a filmatization of my favourite book (if it WAS my favourite book now, that is).

Are we clear now?

Okay.

Maybe I'm too harsh. As a TV-film, this is pretty good.

I just wanted to point out that it (or any other) by far can't live up to Excalibur.

1651561,4,B00005QW5Y,"I dearly love this movie. The atmosphere, the scenery, the music, the cast, and the sense of romance have led me to watch it many times. I have plenty of other DVDs and tapes I cannot say that about, and wish I had just rented.

Comparisons to the book abound, but I read the book too long ago to be able to do a detailed one fairly. I will just say that as movie adaptations go, it is not all that awful.

As retellings of the Matter of Britain, the book and the movie are both jokes. The pre-Christian Britons were polytheists; there would have been no predominant cult of a Great Goddess, and certainly no matriarchy. In any case, it is very likely that they were already overwhelmingly Christian by the time of the Saxon invasions. Both book and movie completely ignore the influence of Roman culture, which would have been hard to miss for an observer who was privileged to be present at the time. Arthur, if he did exist, would have been a commander of Roman-style heavy cavalry, which could very well have been responsible for the respite that the British tribes gained from the Saxon depredations at that time. He also might well have been Christian, or just possibly an initiate of Mithraism.

What finally brought Celto-Roman Britain down in the 7th century was the same thing that doomed other tribal peoples: their inability to set aside intertribal conflict and unite against a common enemy. In fact, the leaders of the various British tribes would not have even thought in those terms; to them, an enemy was an enemy, whether a neighboring kingdom of long standing or an invading force.

All that said, it was a good thing to tell the story from the point of view of the powerful women who helped to shape it. It is a worthwhile counterpoise to the usual tale of big smelly warriors on big smelly horses, and is more true to British culture than the medieval romances were. Having the story set in a religiously diverse milieu is also a worthwhile corrective, even considering that all the details are wrong, since the Church did not fully control religious life in England[1] for another two centuries or so[2].

Suspending disbelief of all the laughable history and theology, the movie still has a certain grandeur. The sense of an enormous brooding fate which neither individuals nor the island as a whole can long escape make it a powerful experience and a worthy piece of literature and cinema. Just forget Arthur's Britain, forget the Roman Empire, forget what little we know about Druids and Celtic religion, and enjoy a fine fantasy enacted by a cast of beautiful and charismatic actors.

1. I have been careful to use ""Britain"" as the name of the island prior to the Anglo-Saxon conquest, a distinction that the scriptwriters failed to observe on one occasion in the dialog. It always makes me wince when I see Morgause refer to it as ""England"" while her people are still defending it against the Angles after whom it was later named.

It feels more like an over imagined version of Atlantis. The costumes and characteristics of the people are very far removed from the original. However the worst thing about this production is the reinvention of the basic story which was so beautifully written. Obviously a book of this scale cannot be kept intact (as we have seen with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) however it would have been better to drop a lot of the background and concentrate on a simpler story which was more in keeping with the original.

Not only do we have this, but also Merlin, Excalibur, Lancelot and Guinevere,Knights of the Round Table, Prince Valiant, Merlin of the Crystal Cave, Quest for Camelot, the awful First Knight and the apparently even worse (and imaginatively titled) King Arthur.

Mists of Avalon is the best I've seen so far. After the rather childish Merlin and the just plain weird Excalibur I was pleased that this film was more grown-up and with better characters who you can actually connect with.

I've not seen Julianna Margulies in anything else aside from Out for Justice (yay!) and Ghost Ship. But damn, she was totally gorgeous as Morgaine, a character previously portrayed as a villain.

Though I have the book by Marion Zimmer Bradley, I have not yet read it (I'll get round to it). But I can tell you now that her version of events tells it from the point of view of the women and how their conspiring and unloyalty brought about the end of Camelot. For a legend with so many incarnations this angle was quite refreshing.

It's far from a woman's film though. It does, however, a lot of love story in it. But it's the kind of love story where you know what the characters are thinking and what they feel rather than just something rudely stapled on to appeal to the women.

Mists of Avalon is also wonderfully shot and has many scenes of unique atmosphere. All of this, obviously, is backed up by Lee Holdridge's utterly beautiful score. A dozen great themes and moods played out to various emotions. Definitely one of the best scores ever, methinks.

Like I have said, there are loads of movies to choose from regarding this legend. But Mists of Avalon is the best I have seen so far. So I recommend that you choose this 'un.

The strange triangular relationship between Morgaine, Arthur and Gwenwyfar was thrown aside for the more lurid and ""sexy""? incest aspect. Morgaine's influence on her brother Arthur was only hinted at; this destroys the idea that pagan religion really influenced British Christianity.  I thought that Bradley's book had really shown how Avalon was a ""real"" place, where real people lived, worked and worshipped.  In the movie, however, we are shown an Avalon that has alien looking, bald women, seemingly gliding about by some magical powers on an island that looks like something out of Dune or Star Wars.

There is no true hope offered in this movie and only cold comfort if any.  I didn't watch the movie to get depressed, but this one sure tried!

Julianna Margulies portrays Morgaine adequately, while Joan Allen as Morgause does a superb job although at times can be a tad bit too sinister---due again to the compact format of the film version which does not give her enough dialogue to be sinister and subtle at the same time.  Angelica Houston, as Viviane, the lady of the lake, I believe was miscast---she conveys power, but none of the softness and reluctance that Zimmer Bradley's north country girl displayed in the novel.  Caroline Goodal's performance is perfect as the aging Ygraine, but her younger portrayal lacks the spark and with of the Ygraine depicted in the story.  Alas so many of the novel's most wonderful characters are omitted for the sake of brevity---what a loss!  What a truely vibrant panaroma of personalities this film could have depicted.

Bottom line:  this film is the novel in its weakest most diluted format.  The actors don't have enough material to give fully fleshed out and nuanced performances worthy of the characters developed in the novel.  Nevertheless, it is a good story which hints at the changing of the guard as Britain relied first on paganism and then increasingly on Christianity. too bad it could not have been 10 hours or more.",1094601600,6,1669,4.800699300699301
1651594,4,B00005QW5Y,"Don't compare this movie to the book.  Like all adaptions of books, the movie doesn't come close to the brilliance of Bradley's gem.  However, the movie is a definite companion to the book.  It really doesn't stray far from the plot or the personalities of the characters.  This movie does the book justice.

I did feel that Qwen should have been portrayed in a more nagging or religious obsessed manner but I loved Julianna Margulies as Morgaine (Clooney's gal from early ER episodes).  The rest of the cast were amazing.  The costumes and scenery were perfect.  The beauty of avalon was captured brilliantly.  You must watch this movie (although I reccommend reading the book first).  The experience was nothing short of pure enjoyment",1092873600,4,737,4.91869918699187
1651595,5,B00005QW5Y,"But the screen version of Bradley's timeless classic does its best. An excellent visual version of the exquisite novel for the time allotted. Read the book, though, to get the full power of Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterwork.",1092009600,2,225,5.108108108108108
1651596,4,B00005QW5Y,"I haven't read the book. I watched this movie without any expectations whatsoever, or any knowledge of the plot. Honestly, I didn't even know it was about the legend of King Arthur.
The movie was far better than any of the other Arthur films I have watched. It surpasses Merlin in terms of believability, Camelot in terms of maturity, and almost equals Excalibur. Julienna Marguiles portrays a very convincing Morgaine. The whole story is told from her point of view, and indeed it was a gorgeous retelling. For once, we are given the refreshing view that Morganne was humane, and good. We are given new explanations for the incest between Arthur and Morganne, as well as the blackness of Mordred's character, which is now blamed on Morganne's aunt, Morgause.
What intrigued me about the movie was the portrayal of the Pagan and Christian society, and most interestingly, about how the Pagan goddess still lives on as the Virgin Mary (I still find that interesting, although I don't quite agree with it). Certain things, like having Excalibur return to the goddess and fading off into the silhoette of the Christian cross puzzles me a little to what the symbolic meaning behind it implies. This intermingling of both religions - the link established wasn't as clear as it should have been.
Beautiful performances from Anjelica Huston (The Lady of the Lake), and Joan Allen (Morgause). I didn't really think that Samantha Mathis was suitable to play Guinevere (she didn't really look the part, nor act the part)... and Michael Vartan surprisingly pulled off the part of Lancelot well (Franco Nero is by far one of the most atrocious Lancelots ever). Hans Matheson (Mordred), a relatively new actor, does a better job here than what he did in Les Miserables.
A good cast, and a good movie. I found it a little controversial, and at times slightly disturbing, but it keeps the mystery and intrigue surrounding Avalon as palpable as ever.",1089763200,3,1934,4.899390243902439

Unfortunately, the finished production did not live up to expectations. The book dealt not only with the legend through the eyes of women, but with the clash of cultures. The movie paid lip service to this theme, but didn't really grapple with adequately. I don't think I watched it all the way through.",1089072000,4,436,4.75

But they really shortened it up, took a lot of important stuff out, and took some liberties...such as Uther didn't build Camelot and Margana Le Fey new that she slept with her brother Arthur the day after the Beltane Fires not like years later.  Plus, Guinevere (Gwenwyfar, or something in the book) was as much of a total freaking b*%^^%ch in the movie as in the book.  You want her to be killed at the stake or something.  MMMMM steak,,,,

The only thing i think the screenwriters didn't change were the names of the characters. They made the book seem like it was pro-christianity which is entirely the opposite and changed the greater portion of the plot. They even changed the ENDING!!!!!! now that i think is the absolute worst thing anyone can do to a book. The Mists Of Avalon in book form is quite possibly the most amazing piece of literature ever written and that movie made it seem so silly(i would use a stronger choice of word but hey). I recommend that everyone, especially women and those people who thought the movie was amazing, to read the book.",1082764800,2,758,4.460431654676259

That said, I liked it. No, it was no where as great as the book, but any screen adaptation rarely is. The acting was very good and the casting was acceptable, especially Morgaine and Angelica Houston who was amazing in the part...

I was very disappointed on how Mordred was protrayed as a purely evil human, bent out on the destruction of his own father. Surely, he must of had some conflict arising in him about his father becoming his enemy. Any thoughts or actions of human compassion coming from him, at least once, would have bettered the movie for myself. Also, I wasn't very  pleased with the overall ""Happy Ending"" that took place towards the end which didn't lay true to the actual story. Don't butcher a good story, it doesn't do any justice to the author. All in all, it was a somewhat decent film but nothing spectacular.",1079568000,,769,4.613138686131387
1651646,5,B00005QW5Y,"This is a beautiful retelling of the Arthurian legend, with a welcome twist of change which makes Morgan le Fay (Morgaine) the heroine instead of the villainess we're accustomed to seeing in ""Excalibur.""  The movie begins with three sisters:  Viviane (the Lady of the Lake and High Priestess of Avalon), Igraine (mother of Morgaine and Arthur) and Morgause.  Upon learning of her destiny with the future High King, Uther Pendragon, Igraine is reluctant to accept but very quickly falls in love with Uther, and he with her.  Their secret tryst on the night of her husband Gorlois's death at war, results in the conception of Arthur.  When Morgaine and Arthur are both old enough, they are taken from Uther and Igraine and to their separate futures.  Morgaine is groomed by Viviane to become the next high priestess of Avalon, a magical land which is fading away as people stop believing in it and in the Goddess.  One of the other priestesses is Raven, a kind soul who has taken a vow of silence.  Morgaine grows into a beautiful woman in the form of Julianna Marguilies, and is chosen to take part in the Great Marriage at Beltane.  She doesn't realize until after she realizes she is pregnant with the Beltane child and after her reunion with Arthur that he was the man she slept with in the Great Marriage.  Yuk!  Anyway, lots of twists and turns in the saga of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, the coming of age of Mordred by his evil aunt Morgause, and the slow fading of Avalon of the years passing by and the deaths of Merlin and Viviane.  We all know how it ends.  I screamed right along with Raven when Viviane died.
While this is a great film which I would gladly recommend to anyone with an interest in the legend of Avalon, there are a few roles which I believe was miscast.  Even though they did a great job anyway, I think that Michael Vartan, Edward Atterton, and Hans Matheson were all miscast for their roles as Lancelot, Arthur, and Mordred.  I really believe that they could have found better actors for those roles, but the final selections are well enough.  Joan Allen really sinks her teeth into her role of Morgause-  wonderfully wicked!",1074902400,,2158,4.622047244094488

The Mists Of Avalon was by far the best book I've ever read and I absoloutly loved the fact that someone decided to make a movie out of it.  Unfortunately though I loved the movie it was filled with inacuracies (I'm sorry if that is misspelled) that I just could not overlook.  I can't name them all because if anyone is reading this that hasn't read and watched T.M.O.A I'll ruin things for them.

1651652,2,B00005QW5Y,"The Mists of Avalon is a good story that unfortunately fails to work.  At 183 minutes, it is too long, and yet the viewer is introduced to the large number of integral characters at a dizzying pace.  It surely would have worked better had it been released as two movies, and the storyline slowed down somewhat.
Having said that though, the storyline is certainly exciting and involving.  It is the story of the Court of Camelot and its ties to the mystic isle of Avalon, as recounted by the oft-maligned Morgaine Le Fay.  It is set in ye olde Britain, where Christianity is gaining ascendancy over the ancient druid religion.  In an increasingly desperate effort to keep the old ways alive, Viviane - the Lady of the Lake - shapes the destinies of Morgaine, Arthur, Gwenwyfar, Lancelot and the other familiar characters.  But some of them begin to rebel at being moved around like pieces on a game board.
Why, in such a quintessential British story, were so many American actors used?  They either speak painfully slowly in their attempts to sound English, or they use dreadful faux-British accents that frequently slip.  And while Angelica Huston's accent is admirable, she is too strident and not ethereal enough as the Lady of the Lake.  The thoroughly evil Mordred acts entirely with his eyebrows, and there are some abysmal performances in the minor roles.
Such a lavish production deserves better.  The sets, scenery, and costumes are visually spectacular, but there are too many annoyances to distract the viewer.  The 'mists' of the title are created through an overindulgence in smoke machines, and perhaps this is symbolic of the fact that in the wrong hands, a good story can become a bad film.",1071273600,,1705,4.844827586206897

If you cannot enjoy fantasy without being unimaginative or critical, then don't watch it. It's extremely difficult to create things which one can easily fantasize about and all credit must be given to the producers and cast for even having the guts and imagination to pull it off. They have brought entertainment to the silver screen and made a child's dreams appear as reality. The story line is good, the props are fantastic, so what more could we ask for? Even Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings had lots of holes in them but don't expect a blow-by-blow account in a good movie, otherwise the movie will become too long and our butts will be numb or it's going to bore us to death. This is definitely a movie to be enjoyed, just like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Merlin, Dungeons and Dragons were so enjoyable to those who can fantasise and believe in magic. That's the key, We must believe in magic, believe in the unbelievable and don't expect everything from the movie, so that it will whet our appetites for more of the same. Otherwise, if a movie is so brilliant, it will take the fun out of all other movies in the future and we won't have anything better to look forward to.

If you haven`t read the book, this version is an eye-opener for sure, particularly for an American audience, but if you have, it is disappointing, but understandable at the same time.

The film was told from a unique perspective: that of the women of Camelot. The women struggle with the ending of their matriarchal culture and the rising of a patriarchal one.  No one character is entirely evil. Some are selfish, others are driven to excess by their own desires or manipulated.  In particular, I loved the fact that all the characters were morally ambiguous.  One gets tired of reading about pure and innocent Arthur, virginal Gwenevere and rake-like Lancelot. Well, in Mists tells another story.
Favorites: I loved the facial tattoos. Not overdone, just accenting the characters features. Especially the small blue-lines around the eyes. I enjoyed the characterization of Morgan, and the character of Uther. Uther was handsome and bear-like and kindly. The friendship that  Arthur and Lancelot shared was evident, and I found both actors to be quite handsome. Gwenevere was portrayed as cow-like and docile, and just a bit spiteful.  I even, felt sorry for Mordred, who in my opinion was the worst off, having been manipulated since the point of birth.
I did think it was quite sad and telling that poor Morgan and the others never found happiness. In fact NONE of the characters found happiness towards the end (being stuck in a cloister doesn't cut it, at least for me), but I loved it. Excellent movie. Beautiful soundtrack.

  Mists is a retelling of the Arthur legend through the vantage point of a female narrator.  Morgaine, Arthur's sister has traditionally been portrayed as a scheming woman.  In Bradley's rendition, Morgaine, Arthur, and Viviane are all caught in the same web.  What's most interesting about this version is the fact that we see the events through Morgaine's eyes, thereby developing a sympathy for a normally distasteful character.
  The movie is true to the novel,a rarity in any production.  The actors do a marvelous job embodying their characters and give a realistic sense of life to the viewer.  As the film progresses, one begins to truly lose the world around them and becomes engrossed in this movie, to the point where you find yourself emoting over the events as they transpire.

Huge parts of the plot were left out (i.e, Morgaine's visit to the fairy land, I mean, she is called Morgaine of the Fairies).  These deficiencies were not made up for in any way.  The acting seemed forced and obviously fake at times and I was just confused at times.

Sadly, though, we were deprived of a brilliant moment where Gwen, in one of her typical hysterical whiny fits that made the book so entertaining, reveals the truth about the *ahem* nature of Lance and Art's relationship...as well as revealing the truth about Arthur's feelings for his sister.  That would be another fantastic bit left out--the morning after Beltane.  In the book, Arthur and Morgaine recognize one another.  It is actually a very, very moving passage.  But noooo...that's officially ""Too Hot For TV.""
On the flip side, there were a few things that I must say were okay.  For one, everyone who watched this who had not read the book seemed to understand it, which is more than I can say for most epic miniseries adaptations.  For another, the casting, scenery, and costuming was by and large excellent.  (Although having the same actress play Morgause at 14 and Morgause and 65 was [bad].)  Viviane, Morgaine, Igraine, Lancelet, Arthur, and Uther were pretty much exactly as I had always thought of them in the books.  Gwen was not nearly whiny enough, but that's the fault of the writers--really, folks, if you think I'm being too hard on poor Gwenwyfar, read the ... book.
All in all, you'll have to use your own discretion.  I must warn you, though: if you read the book and liked it, you will hate this movie.  You will not understand it, because there are VERY CRUCIAL ELEMENTS missing.  If you have not read the book, and don't really want to, and are content to think of Lancelet and Gwen as a sweet and star-crossed pair that could have been SO HAPPY together, knock yourself out.  But if you do decide to read the book...well, don't say I didn't warn you.",1048032000,9,2494,4.631818181818182
1651698,2,B00005QW5Y,"Having read the book, Mists of Avalon, I was extremely disappointed that the folks at TNT didn't keep one of the most essential parts of the story intact, that of Morgaine and Arthur knowing each other right after the Beltaine ceremony.  The guilt Morgaine feels and the illicit love Arthur feels are part of what drives each of them in the story.  The other essential details at the end of the movie that were changed also made the story less than it would have been if left the same as the book.
Those folks that do screenplay adaptations from books really need to know their audience before butchering a story like this one.  Read the book.  Rent the DVD to see the beautiful sets and costumes.",1047859200,,697,4.507936507936508

1651702,3,B00005QW5Y,"Revisionist?  Absolutely!  Feminist?  Definitely!  And those were wonderfully redeeming qualities to the book by Marion Zimmer Bradley, of which this DVD is based.  But where Bradley made the legend come alive again in a new way, the movie does almost nothing of the sort.  True, the focus is shifted away from Arthur, Lancelot, and Guenevere, but the motivations of the characters are not portrayed with the fascinating depth and sense of compelling urgency of the book.  Instead, the movie plods--peculiar in that so much of Bradley's plotting was left out.  What remains is a mediocre spectacle--not bad, but with little of the power it could have had.  Occasional scenes work well, the costumes are rich but for the most part not wildly original, the music workable but rarely gripping, acting never over the top but seldom if ever inspired.  Two exceptions bear mention.  The first is the Beltane ritual, in which Arthur unknowingly impregnates his sister--the visual look of that scene, with costumes and body art, was terrific.  And some of the percussive music of the latter Beltane ritual was quite dramatic and catching.  But that's little enough to recommend.  Instead, watch Excalibur for a better vision on film of the Arthurian legend, or read Marion Zimmer Bradley's excellent book.",1042329600,,1297,5.114285714285714

1651724,5,B00005QW5Y,"I know that some of the reviewers did not like the miniseries because they had read the book, and expected more. I feel the same way about the Lord of the Rings. But I haven't read this book, so my review will be based entirely on the film version.
The Mists of Avalon is a beautiful story, based on the Arthurian saga. This tale is told by Morgaine, King Arthur's half-sister, earth-priestess. She begins by telling us that what we have read and heard is a lie. THIS is how it really was. I won't tell you anything in specific, just that what she tells us is very different from what for example Malory tells us in his Le Morte Darthur. The story revolves around the four women of the story, and Arthur. The women being Igraine (Arthur's mother), Morgawse (her sister), Viviane (their sister and Lady of the Lake, also called Nimue) and finally Morgaine.
There aren't any great special effects in the movie, but it's still a lot more beautiful than the LOTR. The costumes, clothing, weapons and armor are all more or less historically correct, and the battle-scenes are also great.
The music was also superb, it captured the ambiance of the setting very well.
Compared to Excalibur, Avalon isn't as masculine or brutal. Where Excalibur shows how dark the dark ages must have been, Avalon shows us the golden light of the age of romance in the midst of an otherwise dark age in europe. Both are good, but I prefer the Mists of Avalon.

So, summa summarum - if you like the Arthur myth, or if you are into earth religions, romance, medieval warfare, or just like a good movie, see this one!",1041638400,,1589,4.517361111111111
1651725,3,B00005QW5Y,"The fact that there is no Perceval and no the search for the Holy Grail in Mists of Avalon testifies to the essentially revisionist interpretation this movie gives on the Arthur legend.  Instead of an evil pagan sorceress, Morgan is a ""high priestess"" of Avalon who wishes to preserve the religion of the ""Goddess"" of Earth and to keep the Britons strong as the Saxons invade the Isles.  This movie depicts many familiar elements like Uther's seduction of Igraine, Lancelot's adultery and Arthur's incest in a different light.  Rather than moments of human weakness, sin, and treachery that require moral redemption, they are shown as necessary acts that would bring about pure and strong heirs and keep Britain and Avalon alive.  This TV movie features impressive sets, costumes, and a strong cast.  It will appeal to those seeking a more historically accurate Camelot prior to the Saxon conquest, and it will delight those wishing for a more active female role in Arthur's rise and fall.  However, it will bore those looking for fantastic elements, bloody battle scenes, and whimsical wizards, and it will outrage anyone who objects to the politicization of sex, the absence of Christian morality and redemption, and the romanticization of paganism (so-called ""New Age"" religion) that is so typical today.
This movie is definately NOT Excalibur or La Morte d'Arthur.  Whearas Boorman's Excalibur was entertaining and deeply moving with its Wagnerian soundtrack and Christian overtones, Mists of Avalon has much lower entertainment value and is devoid of any inspiring message.  Watching it is akin to listening to a lecture on World War Two by some feminist historian talking about the mundane but vital role women played at the homefront while their men fought epic battles abroad.  Mists of Avalon presents a fresh perspective on a familiar legend that ought to be told, but entertainment it is not.",1041465600,3,1903,5.112903225806452

The producers of this film seemed bent on destroying the best aspects of the book and humiliating Marion Zimmer Bradley. I'm sure at this point she's spinning in her grave.
The film veers wildly from the book making it a hollow, uninteresting, gutless version of the book. This miniseries will bore you senseless. There is nothing redeeming about it. Bad acting, bad storyline, boring, and poor special effects.
If you really want to see a better Arthurian tale, ""Excalibur"" or even ""First Knight"" are far better. Please don't waste your time with this pathetic garbage.",1041292800,,744,4.912698412698413

I wept for all that I remembered and all that I had lost - but most of all, I wept for all that I had hoped to regain that would now remain veiled from the world of men...
For all the beauty, for all the talent that came together to birth the tale, in the end it only half succeeds. While the opening adheres to Ms Bradley's intention, the second half of the film is such a drastic departure from anything depicted in the story, it is such a blow to the power of the very characters it purports to uphold that one must ask to what extent Ms Bradley's death was used to advantage by Turner Broadcasting. The profound symbolic meaning of the king-making rite on Dragon Island, the waning of Avalon's powers in the world, Morgaine's alliance with (and ultimate betrayal of) Kevin the Bard are barely mentioned in favor of battle scenes which are poor borrowings from the faded glories of ""Braveheart"" and ""Rob Roy.""

The visual effects and costumes are breathtaking.  The characters are all flawed, which makes them more real to the viewer.
If you have read the book already, bear in mind that the movie is BASED ON the book, not intended to retell it on the screen.  BASED ON, meaning the film does take several liberties, but it is a film.  There is no way the entire book could have fit into the script and in order to get the point across, liberties had to be taken.",1037836800,2,721,4.240875912408759

I say this because (out of necessity) the film skims the cream off the milk, leaving a great deal of what makes the novel cut out, and also takes a few liberties with the novel.  I went into viewing Mists having read the book many times, but keeping in mind that the film was NOT the book and I shouldn't expect it to be.  Separating the two, Mists the film is as excellent in its medium as Mists the novel is in its medium.
Breathtaking is the best word I can think of to describe the visual effects of this film.  With opulent costuming (yet not terribly off for the era and location), wide open countrysides, and realistic settings, the film is a transport to Arthurian Britain.  The three leads--Morgaine, Vivienne, and Morgause--are wonderfully portrayed and true to the novel characters from which they were created.  I could genuinely believe, for the most part, that the cast were actually people right out of 5th century Britain.
The outstanding part of the film in my estimation is how the Old Religion and Christianity are treated, both together and in competition to each other.  I got a real sense of a land embracing two faiths.  Especially noteworthy is how the reverence of the Goddess and the sanctuary of Avalon are presented in both beauty and logic.",1036368000,,1415,4.632

I thought the movie was phenominal, until I read the book and realized how much they actually missed the point of the Marion Zimmer Bradley's story.  They changed the ending and messed with some of the characters motives.
Yet I watched it once more after I finished the book. Julianna Margulies performance as Morgain was beautiful.  She really in my opinion hit the mark. Anjelica Huston also did a wonderful job, even if they changed the story.  The character I was disappointed most with though Morguase, who wasn't evil in the book.
Otherwise I rate this movie as the best I've seen.

I have seen other movies depicting the events of the tale of king Author, the telling of Morgaine being a horrible witch and such, it just seemed like some stereotypical hollywood play back, instead of an in depth story, of personal dramas and fetes. This story rounds the characters out and expresses them and the topic at hand better than i had ever seen done before.

There were more than a few problems with this series - was I looking for complete and utter dedication to the original text of the novel?  No.  But I was looking for at least a majority of the storyline to match up.  That's not what I got.
Okay, here we go - my breakdown of good and bad and all that jazz:
<SPOILER WARNING>
1)  Time constraints - if this series had been given 2 more nights, perhaps things that were done TO the text would have been much improved.  I can respect that having only 4 hours to fit in a bazillion pages of book is difficult (thus the 2 star rating and not the 1).  Do I like what they did with those 4 hours?  No, but I can respect that it made things difficult.
2)  Viviane's/Morgause's death - LAME.  LAME LAME LAME.  Morgause doesn't even DIE in the book.  STUPID AND NEEDLESS. Again, for time constraint reasons I can see why they would kill Viviane that way (Balin and Balan weren't huge enough characters to constitue devoting time to them), however, the Morgause thing was inexcusable.
3)  Uther's Death - Cheesy.  Melodramatic cliche.  Needless adaptation of the script to try and cater to an audience looking more for General Hospital than the Mists of Avalon.
4)  Casting - Lancelot is supposed to be this handsome God among men.  He wasn't.  At all.  Arthur was supposed to be charismatic and likable.  The actor portrays him as a gutless, sniveling little pained man.  I didn't have too much to say about the rest of the cast, but still . . . considering those guys were two MAJOR players, this was a little bit annoying.
5)  Music - Liked it.  Really liked it.  Good picks there.  One of the few things I found truly enjoyable.
6)  Mordred - Barely enough time to decide to dislike him.  Very little character development makes him an ineffective bad guy.
7)  Merlin/Kevin - very minimal parts.  Kevin wasn't even mentioned.  They were pretty important to the whole legend in general, no?  OKAY, THEN WHERE DID THEY GO?
</SPOILER>
I am itching for a new, good Arthurian movie - one that won't make me want to slap people around.  First Knight, Mists of Avalon . . . monstrosities.

Having never read the book, which I understand to be a great read, I had no presumptions about this movie going into the experiance.  I was enthralled.  This film addressed many universal issues.  The first was that those who are in power, really aren't in power.  On might think this is about King Arthur, but it is really about 3 sisters, two of which are vying for control of Briton, while one sister, Igrane, who is rightfully queen, uses it only when needed.  The first lesson is that it is only Igrane who lives at the end.
Another issue that is brought up in this film is the issue of religous and political tolerance.  Mists of Avalon, makes a point that Christianity and Paganism have more in common than either side would usally like to admit.
The last major theme is that there must be unity amidst diversity for any nation to survive, no matter how great.
The acting in this story was superb, despite the bad special effects that really come out on DVD.  The only critique that I had is despite 4 hours of material, the story still felt constrained!  I would have liked Uriens and his son developed more.

Sadly enough, I was right to be so worried; more so than I had hoped to be.  There were many fairly important characters (such as Kevin and Nimue), and, consequently, many relationships left out that had played rather a key role in the story.

The main character is Morgaine (Julianna Margulies) who is Arthur's sister and a priestess of Avalon. She does a wonderful job playing the part as do the other leading women.
The book is breath-taking to begin with and Arthurian lore always makes for an exciting story of love, deciet, betrayal and honor.

1651795,5,B00005QW5Y,"Incredible.  Even with Sam Neal, ""Merlin"" has nothing on this film.  Set in medieval mythical Britain, ""The Mists of Avalon"" tells the story of Morgaine, sister of king Arthur, and does it ever tell it well.  Since it was made for TV, it couldn't have had a very large budget, but it doesn't show in the movie; nothing in the film was wasted.  From king Arthur's court in Camelot to the mystic island of Avalon enclosed in deep fog, ""The Mists of Avalon"" is as believable as ""The Lord of the Rings"".
  Of course, you do have to give it something of a bonus since it is, after all, made for TV, not made for a movie screen in a theatre.  I will admit that there are a lot of theatrical movies out there that are definitely better than this film.  But it is with the greatest sincerity that I tell you that ""The Mists of Avalon"" is the best made-for-tv movie I have ever seen, and is much more powerful than the majority of theatrical movies in its genre(drama).  I think that last battle scene had more emotion in it than any other battle scene I have ever seen, and most of the other action scenes were convincing as well.  The one draw-back is that it is a very, very sad movie, and in the end, not everything works out happily; the movie ends and you feel somewhat empty.

  However I rather liked this movie. For a tv movie it was rather well acted. I have allways found tv movies are made in a rather dull way. The actors usley don't put themselves into their chartures. Not so here. There are fine perfomences in this pic.

  Basicly the book dealt with the women in the arthurian world. First Igarin and her unwillingness to be given to uther, Vivian who wants to keep avilon alive, Guinever who wants to put aside arthurs ""pagan"" ways and have him embrace christianty, Morgorse who craves power, and Morgain who wants to preserve avilon.

  The movie (which plot lines had to be shortened to make time) coverd some of this. We see igrain being taken by uther and the birth of arthur. Anjelica Huston was good as Vivian. She had the most convincing role of the movie. she does what she wills to preserve avilon and the goddess. Joan Allen is good as Morgorse whos lusts after power and will stop at nothing to get it. Juliannna Margulies does well as morgain. she must deal with the pain and saddness of all that takes place. Guinever does not have as much part as in the book but she plays her own part though it seems small in this movie. The actress who playes her does well.  All the femail acters do well here even the small part of guinevere. After all this is a book written by a woman about women. As such the femail actors shine here. The male actors play there part though small. The only men who make any real impression are arthur, lancelot, uther, and mordread. The reast seem to be in the back ground. Even the allustrious Merlin.

  A good movie. not great but worh seeing for those who like me love the legened of camelot.",1027036800,,1928,4.322222222222222
1651797,3,B00005QW5Y,"I bought this movie after just finishing the book, hoping that for once, Hollywood, or TNT in this case, hadn't screwed it up.  I was deeply moved and touched to a whole new way of seeing things after reading the book.  However, after viewing the movie, I was moved more to astonishment.  The first half of the movie is relativley accurate, but the last half just butchers Marrion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece.  Her entire message is lost in this movie. Morgaine's reentry into Avalon in the end of the book is ESSENTIAL to the understanding, whereas in the movie, she is rejected by Avalon.  Also Kevin is left out entirely and his betrayal of Avalon.  I know it's a long book and it's very hard to translate the entire thing to screen, which is why I gave it three stars.  But there are just essential parts of the story that are left out.  Gwenhwyfar is a truly contemptiable character in the book, however in the movie, she is meant to evoke great pity.  I could go on with the critic, but I won't.  Overall, if you haven't read the book, it's a good film, but I do recommend reading the book.  However, if you have read the book and loved it as much as I, and are now watching the movie, prepare yourself.",1026000000,6,1210,4.405405405405405
1651798,5,B00005QW5Y,"Okay- so I never read the book, but I love the Arthurian legends and this was much better than any other movie about the time period, namely ""First Knight"" and ""Camelot"".
The scenery and costuming was gorgeous and I was amazed at how accurately period living was portrayed. There are no 13th century knights in armor at Arthur's court and the swords aren't the huge 5ft long broadswords that came about 500 years after Arthur's time. Everything is so rich in accurate detail that it's hard to stop watching.
Aside from that, the acting is superb, especially for a made for TV movie. It's definately as good as ""Gettysburg"" and ""Nuremburg"" to name a few other landmark TV movies. The balance between action and drama is great and the movie doesn't seem overloaded with too much of either. The computer animated effects of Camelot and Avalon look very real and the musical score is haunting, though a little too modern for my tastes.
I think the only bad thing about the DVD is that there aren't many special features like interviews and behind the scene production work. But with a 3 hour movie on one DVD, it's understandable. Also, some of the plot is a little questionable as far as historical accuracy is concerned, but I suppose that's better explained in the book.
A great movie for fans of the time period or for a rainy Saturday.
Update as of August 28, 2002-  I just finished reading the book and now I like the movie even more than ever.  True, a lot is missing, but it's like that with most movies that are ported to the screen.  The book itself is longer than all three of Tolkein's Ring series combined and I for one am glad that they didn't try to follow the The Mists of Avalon too closely.  It would have been overdrawn and boring like ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""
It is kind of disappointing that over 20 years of plot time is cut out of the movie, but it's more tragic when people die young and it keeps the plot moving along swiftly.  Also, TNT probably can't afford to make a 12 hour epic that follows the plot inch by inch.
I don't know how Bradley would react if she were alive today, but I think the movie is MUCH more accessible to a wide variety of audiences than the book is.  And I think that being able to convey Bradley's message (that all religions are one and the same and that love is blind) is far more important than literary accuracy.
With that idea in mind, the film is much like Christianity is in the book.  It's a simpler explanation of things for simpler people.",1025740800,16,2502,4.437908496732026
1651799,5,B00005QW5Y,"I saw this movie on TV. I have to say it was a terrific movie.  So many elements that made it terrific: The music, the story, the outfits and the perspective of powerful women. The story is mostly told from Morgana's point of view, but it shows how three sisters who are very different from each other chose to live their lives.  How their children deal with the changing times and their life choices. How they influence their environments, and how their old religion/belief is given a face lift.
It is a beautiful tale and defintely a movie to add to your collection of movies.",1024963200,,578,4.495238095238095
1651800,5,B00005QW5Y,"All jokes apart, Mists of Avalon is a discreet adaptation of the main novel. But since we are not here to evaluate the written work, which undoubtedly is far superior, I do give it five stars for its standalone value.
For the first time since I can remember, we get a coherent view into the otherwise mysterious world of Druids and High Priestesses of Avalon and their worries about the various cultural invasions and intrusions into their untouched world.
On the visual side, this TV movie should be considered a winner: the costumes reflect the accurate period in which the story takes place.
If you are looking for knights in their shiny armors, you're in the wrong place, and this is actually good, because there were none between the 6th and 9th Century A.D.
The only armor which could have eventually been seen was a long outdated Roman one...
Now to the actresses/actors: they are all great performers who deliver memorable, strong performances and are all of a very high calibre.
The storyline is subtle and is treated with respect. It winds up slowly to a crescendo that really culminates in a sort of an apotheosis only to slip slowly down to the inevitable end of a period, of a culture, of a belief and of the movie. But is the end really the end?
I found the director Uli Edel, very competent, handling a very complex subject with finesse and light-handed ""magic"".
Perhaps it's not a Historic movie, since it has to deal with very difficult figures to define, such as Merlin and Viviane, not to speak of Morgaine le Fey, but it attempts to bring them to us as true human figures, not as legendary heroes...
They have feelings, worries and true emotions.
In other words, what could have easily become another FANTASY movie has taken a life to itself and brings us a classic tale into a historic perspective.
Some have criticized this movie as being a bad female perspective, sort of ""feminist"" version of Arthur's tale.
I'd like to correct this. I am certainly not a friend of the feminist movement, but this is certainly not that.
Many tend to forget that in the old Briton and Celtic world, women had a very prominent role in society and as such were truly equal, if not superior partners with the male world.
In as much, this movie is just honest with this issue and deals with it in a very fair manner.
Of course, certain visual effects, like the Avalon which appears towards the end of the movie, are a bit rough to deal with, since one could very well see that it was just a matte. Not even a scale model, but a flat matte!!! Shame.
But in my personal view, movies are made or destroyed by a story, actors and directors, not just by music or special effects.
If such was the case, we could very well listen to an audio book or watch digital cartoons.
Thank God there is still a human component in movie making and with it comes some good and glorious imperfection, which in turn, gives a job to so many people to gossip about.
With all its flaws and imperfections, this movie truly deserves my appreciation and my five stars. I also believe it will entertain you as well if you're not out, constantly seeking perfection (which by the way, has always been an elusive and useless activity which mankind has always wasted its efforts in).
My best wishes go to all those who contributed their talents to this movie, for whatever reason they did so.",1023926400,5,3362,4.5495049504950495

In fact, I was so intruiged, that at the end of Part I, I ran to my computer, bought the book online and ran back to the TV to watch part I again. When I got the book, it took me a year to finish, not because it was long, but because I misplaced it several times. The book is incredible! So I had to buy the DVD of the miniseries. The day I got it, I ripped it out of its box and watched it immediately... I was dissapointed by how much the story sways from the book. I know that all retellings are that way, but I was dissapointed. And though I think they managed to get the overall spirit of Ms. Bradley's work, I really would not say they caught much more than that.

I've never read the book (though you can be sure I will now) but this is exactly the way I imagined the legend of Camelot as a child--though I was glad to see Morgaine portrayed in a positive light for once.  She really was the backbone of this version.
The soundtrack is okay, but one would be better advised to purchase Loreena McKennitt's CD THE VISIT instead--it captures the mood of Avalon and the Mother Goddess.",1020124800,,636,4.781818181818182

1651806,3,B00005QW5Y,"Most tellings of the King Arthur story focus on Arthur and Merlin, and perhaps mention Gueneviere as the unfaithful wench that broke up the great friendship of Arthur and Lancelot. Marion Zimmer Bradley took a twist on the story, telling it from the point of view of the 'dark witch' instead of the 'golden haired beauty'.
It's a tale full of the raw power of medieval England, where a belief in nature and natural spirits was vying with the approach of Christianity. It tells not only of women and men's different views of the world, but of love triangles, Christianity ousting the 'old ways', and a changing of culture.
The TNT miniseries version stars Anjelica Huston, Julianna Margulies, and Joan Allen in the girl-power production.  Huston is the magestic matriarch of Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, who in most stories is just the giver-of-the-sword to Arthur. Here she's the protector of Avalon, the center of the old power, one that is being replaced slowly by the bells of Christianity. They in fact share the same physical space, but only those with the power to believe can cross into Avalon.
Margulies is Morgaine, Arthur's half-sister. They share a mother, but Arthur is born when Uther Pendragon lusts after Morgaine's mother Igraine and through deception beds her. Igraine and Viviane are sisters, but while Viviane defends the old ways, Igraine turns to the new (Christianity). The third sister, Morgause, is jealous of the other two and causes quite a bit of trouble.
This was always a favorite book of mine, so I was very curious how they would bring it on screen. The locations were gorgeous - it was shot in Czechoslovakia and has the primitive wildness that medieval England would have had. The costumes were also gorgeous, and the actors and actresses were top notch. I really enjoyed the relationship Morgaine has later in her life.
I do understand that certain of the themes are sensitive to a TV viewing audience. After all, Arthur and his half-sister Morgaine sleep together (not realizing they're related) when they're teenagers, and she bears a son from this union. Also, Arthur and Lancelot were attracted to each other in the book. These layers of sexuality added another dimension to the story, but they were a bit too risque for many viewers. The story was altered to change the way a lot of this was presented.
Also, the scene where Morgaine and Gueneviere first meet was supposed to contrast the beautiful-blonde-Christian vs the small-dark-pagan - at least that's how Morgaine saw it. Because the book is told from Morgaine's point of view, it's not always the reality, of course, but her impression of it. But in the miniseries they stripped away a lot of the dialogue so you loose some of that sense.
And then, near the end, it slips completely away, and where at the end of the book I'm thrilled to have gone on the journey, with the miniseries I wonder just exactly was the spot where they went wrong. I think the key is to watch it and think of it as a way to get people to read the book. It's really enjoyable as a good movie to watch, and if it gets more people to read the book, that's fine by me!",1019260800,93,3140,4.688405797101449
1651807,2,B00005QW5Y,"Having loved Mists of Avalon since it was first published, I was interested to watch the TV adaption of the novel.  Sadly, I found it to be a disappointing adaption, from the wrong ages of characters (Morgause was about 14 in the beginning of the story she can't possibly be played by a woman almost 50!!!) to tacky looking sets.  I kept wondering if I was watching the same basic story.
Perhaps had I not read the novel, I would have enjoyed it more, but I would not recommend it to those who were hoping for an adaption more aligned with Zimmer Bradley's original work.
On the plus side, I did think that Julianna Margulies was an excellent choice for Morgaine.",1019088000,,663,4.471074380165289
1651808,1,B00005QW5Y,"I think my problem with this miniseries adaptation mainly comes out of the fact that The Mists of Avalon is my favorite book.  I've read it at least 3 times.  The first time I read it was in 8th grade, and I loved it then, and I still love it now.  You can imagine my excitement when I found out they were making a movie--no, even better--a miniseries out of it.  I always dreamed of seeing this story told on some sort of screen.  Finally that dream was coming true.
Unfortunately, my high hopes were not lived up to.  I could make a list of reasons why I didn't like this, but I'll try to limit myself to the 1000 word limit of these reviews.  First of all, the choice of actress for the character of Morgaine didn't exactly fit my picture of her.  According to the book, she's supposed to be small and not very beautiful.  Sorry, Juliana Margulies, but I don't see you as small or ugly.  Secondly, in this miniseries, the names were changed.  Usually something this seemingly small wouldn't bother me, but... well, in the book his name wasn't ""Lancelot,"" it was ""Lancelet,"" and even then, it wasn't the name assigned to that character when we first met him in the book.
This book left out huge parts of the plot and ran too quickly through the parts it did cover.  There wasn't enough time to learn all the detailed interactions between characters.  When I watched it on television, it was only 2 two-hour episodes.  It should have been at least four to cover everything in the book.  So much was left out that it was hardly the same story.  The whole character of Marion Zimmer Bradley's book was not captured in this movie.  It's not there at all, and I was hugely disappointed.",1018915200,3,1683,4.412337662337662

I was glad with the cast, except for Anjelica Houston in the role of Vivianne, nothing against her, I like her very much, but I can't get away from my mind the image of her as an ""evil witch"", because of the roles that she had played before, and for the purpose of the book to wash away all the wrong ideas about the Old Religion and it's followers, I think she was not the right actress to perform that role. Anyway, after those 45 minuts  I saw how the original story of the book began to fade in to the mists, and a hole new atrocious plot took place, where some interesting arguments of the author, and very important characters were lost.  For those who didn't read the book, it is comprehensible to like the movie, because the little bit of the book they took was enough to show the magnificence of Zimmer Bradley's work, but it is a shamefull shadow of it for those of us who infact read it.  I give 2 points to it because the work of art was delicious, because after all Morgaine was splendid, even with all that was taken from her, and because, after all, I was puzzled to see how would they clean up the mess they did with the plot until the end, I found that kind of entertaining.",1018224000,3,1314,4.227091633466135

Angelica Houston is wonderfully awe-inspiring as the Lady of the Lake. Her performance is commanding and sensitive at the same time. Julianna Margulies's portrayal of Morgaine is the very heart of the story and she is excellent.

Though it lasts 180 minutes, all I can say is that ""mists of avalon"" caught my attention the whole time, and on every scene I got eager to know what would happen next.
The story is great and I confess I had never read the book. The most interesting thing about this plot is that it's based on historical facts, without being a movie about fights. It offers a new point of view to king's arthur history, with all the elements that make a movie popular: prohibited love affairs, power, envy, magic.

Refer to the title of my review.  ""Auuugggh.""  Because the miniseries had cut the Morgaine-Accolon affair and Morgaine's subsequent return to the pagan ways, the miniseries ended ALL wrong--Morgaine was unable to do something she was able to do in the book.  There is a feeling of peace at the end of the book; at the end of the miniseries there is frustration and despair.
On top of that, I have a smaller gripe; I wish they had used actors of different ages, or at least employed more skillful makeup, so that the characters looked the ages they were supposed to be.  Morgaine is played by Juliana Margulies.  When Morgaine is supposed to be 15, she looks 35, and looks kind of silly clambering about like a schoolgirl on the Tor.  And then, when she is supposed to be sixty, she still looks thirty-five.  It is impossible to get a sense of the historical sweep of the novel by watching the miniseries.

A movie, even a 3-hour one, was doomed from the start to do injustice to the book, but it's even worse than that: the plot has been altered enough that the book is nearly unrecognizable within it except in broadest outline.

1651819,2,B00005QW5Y,"The miniseries The Mists of Avalon is such a stark constrast to the novel it is based on, I seriously wonder why they bothered to title the two works the same thing.
As those who have read it know, The Mists of Avalon is a fresh, startling interpretation of the classic Arthurian legend.  It centers around the women that shaped the legend. It shows how truly powerful they were through a superior plotline.
Nearly every single crucial element to the plot was left out of the miniseries. It dwelled for a horribly long time on the most trivial things, yet neglected to mention some of the most important aspects. For example, the affair between Lancelet and Morgaine, a driving force behind much of the novel version, was only casually mentioned in the miniseries. How Arthur obtained the sword from the stone, which comprises a mere paragrah of the novel, is a fifteen-minute long sequence in the series. Through this misinterpretation, The Mists of Avalon becomes yet another mediocre verion of a classic legend.
Despite its inaccuracy to the book, the miniseries DOES have some redeeming qualities. The acting is very good; I cannot think of an instance of bad acting. The physical appearance of the characters is far from glamourous; their messy hair and tattered clothes are extremely realistic (no glossed-over Hollywood fluff in THIS series). However, this detailed, three-hour long film is NOT meant to be watched in a single sitting. The insanely slow plot is maddening. I found myself wanting to hit the fast-foward button more times than one.
The horrible misinterpretation of the novel and yawn-worthy course of action cannot really compensate for the impressive acting and costumes that grace The Mists of Avalon.
I highly recommend the 800-page novel over the 3-hour long miniseries.",1014508800,6,1797,5.030201342281879

My Opinion: I was hoping for steel on steel action with knight facing knight but instead I got religion versus religion and priest facing priestess. I knew that this version was based on Marion Zimmer Bradley's book, but I did not know that it focused primarily on the women of Camelot and their religion. Avalon it turns out is a hidden island that is the home of the religion that worships the goddess of the earth. They train priestesses here and then send them out into the world to meddle in the affairs of men. Some people may find this interesting, but I was set to see King Arthur and got this instead. The three main actresses do a very good job. Julianna Margulies especially is very good as Morgaine. It's no surprise that Morgaine is portrayed as a victim and not the evil priestess that she is in other versions of the King Arthur legend. Anjelica Huston and Joan Allen also give good performances.

What You Should Do:  If you are a King Arthur purist you should skip this one. This is the story of the women of Camelot. It is written from the woman's point of view, which is quite different in this story.  It focuses mostly on the women and their religion, not on Arthur and the fighting. For some good Arthurian action check out Excalibur instead.

1651821,5,B00005QW5Y,"Mists of Avalon is a beautiful movie with events unfolding before your eyes that just wrenched at your heart. With more debate on this movie then any other in quite awhile. The viewer really has to see it for what is truly is, just a beautiful story. The timelines and historical events were not all accurate, but the true human emotion depicted shines through.
Taken us back to days of long ago, when Goddess was worshipped without fear. Anjelica Houston gave a performance of a lifetime as Viviane, Lady of the Lake. With us questioning her choices and deceits, in the end, we seen she only thought of Goddess. This gave me thought as to our human flaws. How many times have we made a wrong decision for the right reason?
Giving us a character to loath made this fairytale complete. Having the enemy so close as to be Viviane's own sister the jealous and scornful Morgause played by Joan Allen, who gave an award performance.
With the main character Morgaine played by Julianna Margulies we sat enthralled as her life unfolded before our eyes. From a tiny child all through her life of heartaches, triumphs, betrayals and love for her brother King Authur. Whether on the battlefield or of her own heart, her character shined through in the end as a true Goddess.
Whether you loved this movie or you didn't. The one message that truly was received is, no matter what you choose to call her Goddess is within us.",1014249600,,1412,4.607142857142857
1651822,4,B00005QW5Y,"The film Mists of Avalon is absolutly WONDERFUL, if you've NEVER read the books.  However, I have read all of them.  Knowing how enchanting the books are, the film seemed to fall flat.  Granted there was no way of fitting 900 pages into a few hours, but there were some obvious mistakes.  Some of the main characters were left out, due to time restrictions?  However, I loved the Beltaine scene!  It was very well done in my opinion.  But I didn't like how Arthur and Morgaine didn't find out till way later.
On the other hand, if you can watch the film without thinking of the book (I know that is hard!) it is a glorious film!  The visual aspect of the movie is fantastic, and the music is engrossing!  I have come to love Loreena McKennett through this movie!
Also, I loved Julianna M. as Morgaine!  She looked and acted the part beautifully!  Angelica Houston was believable as Viviaine, and Joan Allan was good as the evil Morgause.  I wasn't sure about the actor who played Arthur, but he was good as well.

All in all, SEE THIS MOVIE!...",1013817600,5,1044,4.431578947368421
1651823,2,B00005QW5Y,"""The Mists of Avalon"" by Marion Zimmer Bradley was one of the best books I have ever read.  Sad to say, whoever wrote the script for the movie was not even close.  The movie was horribly depicted and poorly interperted from the book.  Unstandably so, the book was about 900 pages, but leaving out 60 percent of the characters and having people do things they never did is just poor script.  I was so much looking forward to watching this movie after have finishing the book.  Sadly I'm really diappointed.  It was just poorly depicted from the book.  2 stars here.",1013558400,4,564,4.524752475247524
1651824,5,B00005QW5Y,"All through my life, the Camelot/Knights of the Round Table story that I knew of was focused on Arthur & the evil sorceress, Morgaine/Morgana.  I knew they bore a child..but as to how, when & where, was not mentioned nor implied.
The Mists of Avalon has the basic plot of Camelot but through a different point of view --- from the women's point of view.  & though there may be some deviations/alterations (e.g. Morgaine's favorable character/nature), it complements some angles which were not clearly explained in the older/original version.
Here, Morgaine is a loving & devoted sister to King Arthur.  Through the manipulations of people close to her -- those with the noblest intentions & those fueled by greed, she & Arthur & the rest of the kingdom fell in a web of deceit, love, hate & pain.  One of the few survivors at the end, she witnessed the death of paganism & the strengthening of Christianity -- which she has come to terms & learned to accept willingly.",1013385600,,968,4.710059171597633

Vigorous physicality, intelligent eyes, red-orange hair and that textured Welsh brogue! Why haven't more American film directors taken advantage of the nuanced acting of this thoughtful, sexy native (and Royal Shakespeare Company veteran) of Wales? Until they do, we'll have to sustain ourselves with his seductive, swashbuckling, New Age-man turn as Uther Pendragon, and his roles as Crad in Solomon and Gaenor and Danus in the Shell Seekers.

1651826,2,B00005QW5Y,"I was excited about the premiere of this one too, especially when I saw how well-casted it was.  Everyone in this two-part miniseries is perfect for the part - except the writers.  The first half follows the book reasonably well, with only a few problems.  Then there's the second half, which omits every important aspect of the story.  Particularly conspicuous is the absence of the Merlin succession story - Kevin Harper isn't even in the film!  The old Merlin dies without the slightest inkling of why his character was important.  The fairy world is also completely missing.  Then there's the ridiculous ending to the Morgause subplot, an idiotic departure from the book.  In all, this was a glorious idea, with a promising beginning, that comes crashing down to an ignominious failure.",1011657600,5,790,4.977099236641221
1651827,4,B00005QW5Y,"It was refreshing to see an epic medieval movie that sheds a femenine perspective on a familiar story. Cinematically it was breathtaking. I wanted to live in Avalon. The actresses were all captivating, especially Anjelica Huston as the priestess Vivienne. I particularly enjoyed the focus on the religion of the Goddess as a generally positive force that (like everything else) was corrupted by those who desired power. Everyone who has read the Arthurian legends or has seen Excalibur should see this for a possible ""other side"" of the story.
My one criticism was that the men playing Lancelot and Arthur were too Beverly Hills 90210. Seeing clean-cut Hollywoodish men just pulled me out of the medieval setting. The producers should have found some sexy but swarthy men who didn't detract from the authenticity of a time before electric razors...",1011571200,,848,5.107913669064748
1651828,1,B00005QW5Y,"I have read the MZB Classic ""Mists of Avalon"" and all the prequels several times over the last 10 years and have found it to be a refreshingly non-stereotypical portrayal of the themes and people who would later be calls ""pagans.""  But with this film, Bradley is most likely rolling in her grave and her heirs should request a formal apology!
The writers not only completely changed the book's story to suit their own marketing goals, but rewrote all of the Myths they are based upon to fit the modern hollywood ""formula.""  The director's vision was more akin to ""Zena"" with garish, practically non-period costumes and armor and a ridiclous Avalon set which completly ignors all the concrete details that MZB gave very clearly. For example--where did it ever say that the initiates on Avalon shaved their heads? Avalon looked more like a garish buddhist monastery with all the women in yellow robes (not blue), make-up and jewlery.
Old negative stereotypes of ""Paganism"" are trotted out and beaten to death--making the followers of the goddess either look like simpletons, or evil, power-mongering, manipulative witches. The film is chuck full of hollywood tricks and trite interactions with the standard cast of characters...in overdone make-up. To be fair, however, the christians are also made to look pretty foolish. Simply put--there is almost no depth worth noting in this movie.  The only highlight is that Julianna Margulies makes a very good Morgaine and did her best with the material she was given.
To cut it short--it was an abomination, a shallow, formulaic movie in it's own right, even without the book for comparison, and an offense to modern pagans like myself.  If you think you are interested in this movie, just go read the book and enjoy...",1010880000,11,1761,4.979591836734694
1651829,1,B00005QW5Y,"In writing about The Mists of Avalon, Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote,
""One of the main problems I had, in writing the Arthurian novel, was the fear that Christians would feel I was attacking the basics of Christianity, rather than the enormous bigotry and anti-feminism that have become grafted on to Christianity. I don't think they have any part in Christianity itself, or in the teachings of Christ...And, I suppose, a little, the purpose of the book was to express my dismay at the way in which religion lets itself become the slave of politics and the state.""
Given MZB's intent, I have to say that this has to be one of the most appallingly bad hashes of an excellent work of literature that I've ever seen, PERIOD.  I can understand having to abridge events because of the length of the novel, but the changes made didn't abridge the work -- they changed it ENTIRELY, much to the story's detriment.  Any slightly sordid theme of the book got played (and replayed, and replayed and replayed - how many times did they flash back to Arthur's being with Morgaine?); the more intricate subplots which played out MZB's intent were almost entirely ignored.
Instead of a thought-provoking work on how power politics coupled with a barren queen's obsession with childbearing prompted a change from Paganism to Christianity (and how bigotry fouled the latter religion),  we end up with a saccharine and shallow offering which lacks any intellectual interest whatsoever.  Certainly it lacks the point that MZB was trying to make with this novel.
If she could still accept it, this film's makers owe Marion Zimmer Bradley a profound apology for this massacre of her work. I couldn't put the book down, but I couldn't wait for this farce to be over and done with so I could turn it off.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING IT.",1010361600,22,1813,4.761146496815287

the Arthurian legends. The ending is really good. Bear in mind, you might not like it if you believe it should be strictly to the book. It's more of a summary of what happens in the book. It's still good. There's one scene with a Lorenna McKinnet song,
""The Mystic's Dream"" and it fits the scene just perfectly. a clouded dream on an earthly night/hangs upon the cresent moon/a voiceless song in ageless light/sings at the coming dawn/birds in flight are calling there/where the heart moves the stones...

It is one thing to edit a book to make it into a movie, but it is another thing to butcher it.  In their attempt to cram the whole novel into a three hour mini-series (4 hours with commericials), the audience is left confused by rushed events and unexplained plots.  It would have been better to make it a longer mini-series or feature film so that the true story could be told and that the actors could shine even more.",1009929600,15,584,4.178571428571429

I have to say the book was alot better than the film, Although it has a stellar cast and the scenery is fantastic but at 3 hours long the story goes by so slowly you find yourself reaching for the fast forward on the remote !. There doesnt seem to be any climactic moments or excitement, even the battle scenes seem mild. If this had not have been made for T.V. it could have been a far more superior film. As far as the DVD special features, these include a number of very short deleted scenes, a storyboard of the opening credits and some costume designs, the filmographies are very limited and do not include all the actors, again a bit of a disappointment.
If you are a fan on the book then you will surely buy this DVD, especially as the price is so good, but just don't have too high expectations.",1009411200,3,987,4.172774869109948

I had read the book and found it delightfully entertaining and would read over and over again.  After watching the movie, I found myself disappointed on how they had interpreted the story by leaving key events out.  However, Juliana Margulies and Angelica Houston portrayed the characters very well.  Other characters could have been better portrayed, not only by the actors but by the script as well.  But for what it is, the movie was still entertaining and would recommend that people see this movie, at least once.",1008633600,,634,4.88785046728972
1651834,2,B00005QW5Y,"Ah yes, Marion Zimmer Bradley's feminist/pagan slanted retelling of the Arthur legend finds itself cast as a lurching, awkward TV movie. I was hoping for the best for this, but instead found it a bone-cruchingly self-serious tale set in a land where nary a hairbrush is to be found (for most of the cast sports hair so plaited and oiled as to become a distraction).
What traditionally is a lusty legend full of passion and betrayal becomes a bloodless overly-intellectual exercise in which all the actors (with the notable exception of the always great Joan Allen) seem to have inhaled too much, ahem, incense. Ploddingly paced and directed by Uli Edel (who managed to make S&M candle-wax dull in Madonna's ""Body of Evidence""), and with serviceable, but sub-par, photography by Vilmos Zsigmond the film never gains any sense of awe or wonder, instead playing its visuals as close to the bodice as it does its emotions. It is a film almost completely without dynamic. With such a strong group of lead performers, one would hope for them to have something meaty to bite into, but instead, the get a thin broth of a story and roles.
Many people have brought up the balanced and accurate pagan portrayal that is present in this film. Fine, except that, as it is truly a sedate and contemplative religion, its simplicity and un-sensational nature (no pun intended) doesn't help to make a dull film any livelier (no offense to paganism and wicca meant).
And suffice to say, I hesitate to recommend any film in which Uther Pendragon (traditionally a king who's passions and desires exceed his intellect and sire of the great Arthur, King of England) is most memorable as being... short.",1008547200,2,1679,4.833333333333333

True, the mini series left out a great deal of info from the book but that is always to be expected when there is a movie adaptation of a book. Some things were also changed from the book to the movie but all in all I thought that the mini series did a fair job and I'm sure that Ms. Zimmer Bradley would have been satisfied with the finished work.
The fifth star is for the things that were left out and or changed. For those of you who haven't read the book and wished to know what was left out, GET THE BOOK!

The plot moved along far too quickly with not enough attention paid to developing relationships.
