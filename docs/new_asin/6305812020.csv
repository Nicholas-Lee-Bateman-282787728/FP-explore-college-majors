1083940,5,6305812020,"I love this film. Emmanuelle Beart made her debut in this film and she is breathtakingly beautiful.  Her husband Daniel Auteuil also starred in the film.  I don't know if they met on the set or not but it was certainly made at the beginning of their careers in film.
The story of Manon (Beart) continues in this film.  In JEAN DE FLORETTE she was a little girl, who accompanied her parents to Provence where her father took up the cultivation of Carnations on the old family farm.  Uncle (Yves Montand) and cousin (Daniel Auteuil) next door objected as there was only enough water to supply one farm.  The result was a water war.
In MANON, the young Manon has grown into a young woman.  She lives a relatively wild life on the old homestead, raising goats who follow her everywhere like children.  Cousin (Auteuil) realizes one day that he is in love with her.  But a dark secret hangs over his head and if Manon knew the secret she might hate him (has to do with water).
The rest of the plot consists of the resolution of problems, tensions, difficulties set up in JEAN DE FLORETTE.  I can't imagine anyone buying one film and not the other.  I am buying both DVDs.  They are a set.  The cinematography is wonderful, the actors are superb.  If you love Provence you will want to own these DVDs so you can watch them on those cold rainy days when you aren't in France.",973814400,16,1368,4.402390438247012
1083941,5,6305812020,"As sad and tragic as ""Jean de Florette"" (which should be seen first) was, this is a delight, and one of Claude Berri's very best films. Emmanuelle Beart, looking like a wood nymph, is beautiful as Jean's daughter, bent on revenge, and Daniel Auteuil as the lovesick man who's past comes back to haunt him is terrific.
Yves Montand is magnificent. This is one of his greatest performances, and shouldn't be missed. His scene with the blind woman is so memorable. I think about that scene often, and of how easy it is to make life changing mistakes by misunderstanding circumstances.
The soundtrack by Jean-Claude Petit is lovely, using a theme from Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino"" as its main melody, and the cinematography superb. Best of all, the ending is perfection. Satisfying. A work of art completed.",971136000,4,805,4.840579710144928

I sit back, relax, and allow the  beautiful French scenery and symphonic melody of the French language  swallow me whole. I almost feel like I'm running through the hills of  southern France and drinking wine with those who really have a sense of  community.

1083945,5,6305812020,"Within my top five favourite films at this point, Manon of the Spring is a conventional, brilliantly acted story of lost romantic longing, revenge, redemption, and forgiveness.
Daniel Auteuil shines as the physically  unattractive Ugolin, smitten with hopeless desire for the wild shepherdess  Manon (the heavenly Emmanuelle Beart), daughter of the deceased Jean (from  Jean de Florette).  Their interaction in this pastoral countryside is  priceless, especially if you know the back story, the complicated character  dynamic between Manon and Ugolin.  Manon's subsequent revenge on the entire  town has a tragic air to it, because though you know she's justified in her  actions, the townsfolk are portrayed in such intimate detail that you will  find yourself drawn to them, sympathizing.  Much like the peasants of Seven  Samurai, you see their folly, but feel for their distress.
Director  Claude Berri has the good sense to let the very intense dramatic situations  in this story play out in a naturalistic, restrained manner.  Instead of  bursting out into the proclamatory Jacobean mode, Manon of the Spring lets  the tragic moments and points of emotional outburst breathe, instead of  drowning them out in tirades of sentimental outburst.  The results are  simply stunning.
I saw this film before I saw its predecessor, Jean de  Florette, and the result was a wonderfully different experience.  I  recommend trying it out as an experiment -- Manon of the Spring stands on  its own as an autonomous piece of superb storytelling, but its  reverberations change once you've seen Jean de Florette.",947376000,13,1602,5.286852589641434

1084051,5,6305812020,"Two part film, that was 1st released as two separate features.  Terrific telling of a complex story of intertwined farming families in rural France in the early part of the 20th century.

The acting is mostly of the highest order.  Yves Montand, one of the most suave men in history is completely believable as a rough hewn, self-centered farmer, Gerard Depardieu, also cast against type, as a gentle, educated city born man trying to make it as a farmer also is astounding.  Almost as good is Daniel Auteuil as Montand's not-very-bright son.

 Only Emmanuelle Beart, gorgeous though she may be,  doesn't quite convince me as the wild woman of the fields. Some of it is performance, some of it is how perfect she looks.

The story is wonderful in a Dickensian sort of way, with clues and character elements showing up early, only to pay off three hours later.  I love the first part even more, somehow it feels more truly tragic and dense, the 2nd part just a bit too neat by the end.  But still a grand, intelligent, great looking entertainment.",1341187200,,1046,4.666666666666667

1084055,5,6305812020,"""Manon of the Spring,"" (1986), a French drama, is a sequel of sorts, and a tale of revenge.  It's also a mouth-watering, award-winning color film, set apparently, in the early 20th century, in Provence, in the gorgeous, fertile south of France. With its prequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-De-Florette/dp/B000053VBN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean De Florette</a>, -- well, actually, it's not so much a  prequel and sequel, it's more just a direct continuation of the story -- it tells a bittersweet tale of life among the peasantry of the time. It is based on a novel, with which I am not familiar, by Marcel Pagnol, with whose work, I regret, I am also not familiar, tho I believe he was a screenwriter of note; was adapted for the screen and directed by Claude Berri.

You can watch ""Manon"" without seeing ""Jean de Florette"" first, but I don't know why you'd want to.  At any rate, the movie picks up the story of the locally-prominent Soubeyran family, who have been scheming for their own advancement, with little consideration for others. Cesar Soubeyran, known as ""Le Papet"" locally, is the wealthy, almost last survivor of a dynasty of hard-working, successful peasants, and treated with great respect in his village. As played by the magnetic, older Yves Montand, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wages-Of-Fear-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B001PYD0KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wages Of Fear - (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>];<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diabolique-The-Criterion-Collection-Spine-35/dp/0780021940/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diabolique (The Criterion Collection) Spine #35)</a>), he is as hard a man as his long life has made him. Then, his possibly not all there nephew Ugolin, played by Daniel Auteil, always so successful at playing not particularly bright characters (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Closet/dp/B00005OSLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Closet</a>) had come home from his stint in the army. The older man is anxious to see his nephew married, with children, settled locally, and making a living before his illnesses end his life. Accordingly, Cesar has his eye on a plot of land that adjoins his holdings, and several healthy looking girls in the village.

But the land the Soubeyran family covets had been inherited by an outsider, a tax collector civil servant; a luckless hunchback played by the magnificent Gerard Depardieu, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Card/dp/B00008977F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Card</a>),who had come to the village bearing some regulation outsiders' French name, a wife and young daughter. However, if Jean had been called by the name he should have been in the village, had they known who he really was, he would have been known locally as Jean de Florette, the title character of the first installment. At any rate, the Soubeyrans, Cesar and Ugolin, pretended to befriend and help the naive and generous hunchback, who was inexperienced in farming, but had many ambitious plans, some entirely unsuited for the location. Nevertheless, the Soubeyrons secretly worked against the would-be farmer, most importantly by depriving him of water.

Greedy, cruel behavior to be sure, with tragic consequences. We begin ""Manon"" with a glimpse of the title character, the daughter of Jean de Florette., in the person of the beautiful Emmanuelle Beart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nathalie/dp/B000ENC73G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nathalie</a>).  After the death of her father, which she believes was caused by the Soubeyrans, she has grown up largely on her own, as her mother has had to seek work elsewhere.  Manon is rather an uneducated wild child as a result: she has kept herself alive by being a shepherdess, and hunting small birds for sale.  She decides to take revenge against the village that allowed the Soubeyrans to behave as they did, and deprives the village of its water, causing great chaos and consternation.  Ugolin is greatly in love with her, but she, of course, will have nothing to do with him: she rather fancies the handsome young local schoolteacher, who is, however, miles above her in the village's social order.

The film is moving, powered by the work of its stars, as these characters work out their destinies, and reach a somewhat surprising conclusion: not the one for which Cesar had hoped, but one he can appreciate. ""Manon"" may be thought to have dated a bit, to be a bit too reliant on coincidence. Still, it seems to me grounded in reality. We watch the first telephones and automobiles creep into town, the appearance of new styles of dress. And I believe that French peasants, any peasants really, have historically wanted only certain things: land, with water on it; real gold, not paper scrip, and the success and survival of their families. A memorable piece of film-making that deals with great issues and essential truths in its way, and an enjoyable one, too.",1285977600,,5160,5.848404255319149

1084147,5,6305812020,"Manon, the daughter of Jean de Florette returns to Provence and lives in a small cottage on the property of her father. In the previous film, her father had died trying to make the farm work but discovered without a source of water, it was impossible. The farmhouse and certain lands were sold at decreased value to the neighbor Cesar Soubeyran. He finds a mysterious supply source for water which had eluded her father.

Soubeyran's nephew, Ugolin Gallette secretly falls in love with Manon as she wanders the hillsides Provence tending her flock of goats. Manon however pays little attention to him while she keeps a keen distant eye on a newcomer, the teacher in the town who walks among the hills, examines the soil and takes a high interest in local developments. A mysterious chemistry develops between them. Meanwhile Ugolin becomes uncharacteristically ill and after being prodded he confesses to being in love. Cesar gives him advice on how to impress his heart's desire but Ugolin botches the attempts.

After Manon tries to save a goat which falls from the hillside to the rocks below, she discovers a cave and cavern, which are the original source of the spring. She develops suspicions about the cause of her father's death. She deliberately stops up the water supply which eventually affects the whole town. At a townhall meeting set up specifically to meet the farmers' need for water, a government official manages to add further insult to injury. The official produces survey records which indicate there is no spring on the land. Meanwhile, the local priest was apprised of the true cause of Jean de Florette's death. In his sermon the priest admonishes the community that G-d may be punishing them for their sins. Accusations fly of who and what caused the spring to dry up. Religious devotees partake in a ceremony after which the water supply is restored. In effect, a miracle has occurred! Cesar Soubeyran suffers a sad, unexpected devastating blow associated with his nephew. During a visit to the cemetery, Cesar reminisces about his past with a blind woman sitting next to him on a bench. She supplies him with crucial details which become the final nail in his emotional coffin. The details become an unanticiapted revenge, one from beyond the grave. This film is deeply satisfying in its portrayal of local culture, greed,  outstanding characters and the ultimate surprise ending. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1264723200,3,2436,4.980343980343981

It is the beginning of this family saga of greed, destruction, evil, hope, deceit.  Claude Berri is a writer, producer, actor and director.  His best work is the two films in part one and part two.

Jean de Florette is the story of a hunchback man who has inherited land with a home for his wife and daughter.  Unbeknownst to him, a greedy landowner and his nephew have engineered a plan to block access to the water for his farming.  Tormented by the two, Florette is driven to devastating consequences.

Manon of the Spring continues 10 years later landowner Soubeyran has asked his only relative Ugolin to find a wife in that Soubeyran can leave his inheritance.  Ugolin has his eye on Florette the hunchback's beautiful daughter Manon, a sheepherder.  But her mission is to seek revenge against Ugolin and his uncle Soubeyran for the torment that lead to demise of her father's farm with devastating consequences.  In turn, she cuts of the water supply to the entire village which leads to very angry townspeople.  The two men are publicly accused and also, Ugolin can't bear Manon's rejection.

1084150,5,6305812020,"Passion should be felt, revenge observed with detached honesty, as within this exceptional film (directed by Claude Berri). Watched Manon of the Spring (Manon des sources) while reading Ovid's Art of Love (Ars Amatoria). My first question was: Are the director and screenwriter treating the themes of love (turned to hate), passion (turned to vengeance), and intimacy (turned to venom) with artistically-inclined disregard (aplenty) or with delicacy (afresh)? These are not themes to be trifled with; some regard for virtue must be maintained for the woman when men have plotted with cunning against her beloved father. Now we come to the major themes at work within this story (based on the novel L'eau des Collines by Marcel Pagnol).

Poetic justice must prevail or the intricately-layered crescendo of the storyline will falter and burn without attaining its proper denouement. One asks: Does the heroine (Manon, played exquisitely by Emmanuelle Beart) deserve a romantic treatment as a tragic heroine, who falls from grace and redeems herself in time? or Do we observe a deliberate re-fashioning of the traditional feminine model of virtue, where the woman goes astray because men have driven her to act with subtle resolve. In either case, Manon would be a tragic figure, who deserves our sympathy even as we empathize with her character throughout her deadly planning. Innocence was lost, then regained through poetic justice; that would be the premise.

We come again to the stream of vengeance, where some women (perhaps without knowing it) become deadly over time, poco a poco. The tension wire, now real within the plotline, stretches into the heart of the film. We observe Manon's deliberate seduction of her neighbor (the focus of her revenge); she is the shepherd, he is the wolf. Her innocence draws us further into the act (itself); her nudity draws her victim to his eventual death. Through demure seduction, the noose is pulled tighter. Manon's hate, a deep well overflowing with years of plotting, reminds us that once her trap is set, there is no turning back; she has sealed one man's destiny to equal the score. The full cunning (dramatic irony) of our heroine is not exposed until the truth about her father is revealed to Ugolin (played brilliantly by Daniel Auteuil). His suicide completes her act of retribution. Her pregnancy redeems her spirit, like a fresh mountain spring. The stream has now changed from vengeance to the life within her womb. Manon can now grow into maturity; her heart has been set free of malice and hate.",1245196800,,2554,5.064133016627078
1084151,4,6305812020,"This is a good sequel to ""Jean de Florette"" which was made earlier in the year this was made. Both movies should be seen back-to-back to make this story complete and comprehensible. Actually, this really could be called ""Jean de Florette: Part Two.""

""Manon Of The Spring"" features Emmanuelle Beart, who has to have one of the prettiest faces ever put on film. She plays the now-grown-up woman who gets revenge on the men who ruined her father when she was a little girl.

As in the first film, this has interesting characters. The cinematography isn't quite as striking as ""Florette,"" but still decent.

It doesn't get any better than this, folks.  These films are simply bursting at the seams with poignant lessons on humanity.  One which I admire the most is the tax collector-turned farmer's (Gerard Depardieu) single-minded perseverance to realize his dream.  One might argue that he selfishly ignored the well being of his wife and child in pursuing his dream.  But I contend that he would not have chosen this path had he thought for one second that his family did not share the same passion.  In fact, we observe nothing but unwavering love and support from his wife and child.

For you travel lovers out there, is there a better way to immerse yourself in life in a quaint French village without leaving the comfort of your living room?  This is one of the reasons I love well-made foreign films.  They transport you ever so eloquently to another land and time.

Watch these films.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",1170979200,4,1210,4.550925925925926

I am rating this version 3 stars instead of 5, because of some curious censorship in this version.  The theatrical release has a brief nude scene of the exquisite Emmanuelle Beart.  This scene is not only essential in revealing her beauty and innocent joy, it is essential to understand Ugolin's growing madness regarding her.  In the Korean version, the nude scene is blocked out, as if we are looking through a translucent piece of glass.  Very strange.

In the previous film, her father had died trying to make the farm work but without a source of water, it was impossible. The farmhouse and certain lands were sold at decreased value because of the lack of water. The neighbor Cesar Soubeyran bought the farm and unblocked the spring ...

Soubeyran's nephew, Ugolin Gallette, who was part of the conspiracy to drive Jean de Florette from the land falls in love with Manon as he watchers her tend her flock of goats and while she wanders the hillsides of Provence, setting traps for birds that she sells in the market. Manon keeps a distant eye on a newcomer, the teacher in the town who walks among the hills, examines the soil and takes a general interest in his new home. The teacher loses his knife which Manon finds ... they meet and she returns the knife which he insists she keep with all its fancy gadgets. A mysterious chemistry develops between them ... Meanwhile Ugolin behaves uncharacteristically claiming to be ill. His Uncle prods and eventually discovers he is in love. Ugolin finally admits with whom. Cesar gives him advice, dress like a hunter, impress Manon, talk to her nicely ... Ugolin botches it up as he stammers out his declaration of love.

When a small goat drops from the hillside among the rocks below ... Manon strives to save it. She discovers a cave and cavern which is the source of the water supply for the spring. She works hard to block it up which eventually dries up the water source not only for Ugolin and his precious carnations (cash crop) but for the whole town. It causes an uproar to the point of a government official visiting who promises a large supply of bottled water to solve the needs of the people. It upsets some farmers who want more done stating the spring supply needs to be restored so they can continue to farm and save their crops. The official checks the records and proves there is no spring on the survey maps ... Meanwhile, someone may have confessed to the local priest about the unusual circumstances regarding the death of Jean de Florette associated with the blocked up spring in the past. In his sermon the priest  admonishes the community that G-d may be punishing them for their sins ... One farmer accuses Cesar Soubeyran of having caused the problems claiming he saw them block up the spring and heard the discussion with his nephew. Cesar denies it and adamantly claims Jean died of an accident ... After the community prays and the devote partake in a religious ceremony, Manon unblocks the spring with the help of the school teacher. In effect, they brought about the miracle which the religious people had prayed for ... Cesar Soubeyran suffers a sad but not unexpected devasting event involving his nephew. During a visit to the cemetery, a local blind woman sits next to him on a bench and reminicses about the past, particularly his youth when he fell in love with Florette, who left the village and married a blacksmith in another town. Cesar receives information which brings the final and eternal blow to his life ... It is a phenomenal surprise ending which finalizes the unanticiapted revenge, one from beyond the grave. This is a superb film with much depth, mystery, and unexpected twists, a totally satisfying and excellent viewing experience. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1156982400,7,3428,4.71

Yet the movie works on many levels: on one, it is like a complex detective story, with tiny clues sprinkled throughout gradually coming together at an overwhelming ending. On one level, it is a comedy, poking fun at pompous scientists and ignorant folk. On another, it explores unrequited love, a topic the movies usually avoid. On another it about the lush scenery and quaint village life in France. Yves Montand is a brilliant actor. He packs so much depth into every second he is on screen.  He feels like a real person.

It's 10 years later, and the little girl Manon (Emmanuelle Beart), who knows the secret of the spring, is grown up now. Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) has fallen madly in love with her, but she repels him and then reveals the secret. He commits suicide. Then it's revealed, though it's no surprise, that Mannon's father was actually the son of Ugolin's uncle Le Papet (Yves Montand). We could figure this out from he beginning of JEAN DE FLORETTE.

Again, though, this is a folktale expressed on film and surprises are not important, only the telling is - and that is done excellently. The portent of magic is even introduced when the town's well dries up in a drought; a ""ceremony"" is conducted and the water flows again.

1084204,5,6305812020,"Manon des Sources (1986) is the screen rendition of Part 2 of Marcel Pagnol's exquisite novel, L'eau des Collines (1963).  It is the continuation of the story of Jean de Florette, concerning two competing projects, one carried-out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasant Ugolin, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920s

Manon des Sources owes its success to Pagnol's particularly intelligent scenario.  Taken verbatim from his novel of the same name, it was flawlessly adapted by Claude Berry and Gerard Brach, whose work consisted mainly in translating into images this impeccable scenario.

As stated in my review of Jean de Florette, a good story must have a plot, a compelling conflict, and characters that we care about who change as a result of their experiences. This particular story qualifies unquestionably as a good one, on all these points.

In Manon des Sources, the second chapter of his novel, Marcel Pagnol uses the same approach in his story that he did in Jean de Florette, posing questions and providing answers in a more or less convoluted, drawn-out way, the better to keep the viewer's suspense high.

The first and most important question in this chapter concerns the soothing of our bad conscience following the less than satisfying conclusion of the preceding film.  We feel perturbed for having resigned ourselves to accepting the outcome, the success of Ugolin's project, which we never totally rejected, at the expense of Jean's project, which we by now wish had succeeded.  How will Pagnol liberate us from this disturbing feeling?  We already know that he is not interested in introducing a Deus ex machina to discharge our anxiety.  He will again proceed objectively, relying on the psychology of the different characters involved.

The second question concerns the two new characters appearing on the scene: a grown- up Manon and Bernard Olivier, the school teacher.  We hope that they will be the ones to provide us with a more satisfying resolution to the first chapter.  But what is done is done, and the only liberation from our sense of guilt must be a plain, straightforward type of revenge on Ugolin and Csar for their crime.  Will it be sweet and innocent Manon, or will Bernard offer a solution?

When the perfidy of Cesar and Ugolin is finally exposed, our conscience is partially appeased by Ugolin's suicide.  But Cesar's retribution will be more terrible yet, in what is one of the most dramatic endings of any film I have ever seen. Eventually, it is not certain that we applaud this ending either, as no matter how devious Ugolin and Cesar  were, we cannot totally erase the positive feelings they and their project inspired in us at the beginning of the first film.

For the interpretation of the three leading roles, film director Claude Berry chose three exceptional actors, each with a unique personality and film presence.  In the role of Cesar we could not have imagined anyone other than Yves Montand, native of Marseille, a fabulous actor with more than sixty films on his resume, cabaret singer, and at one time candidate for France's presidency.  This aging character of Cesar, cantankerous at times, a happy strapping fellow at other times, a sensitive and vulnerable human being, is Montand himself, and vice-versa.  Gerard Depardieu is outstanding in his role of Jean, being both somewhat arrogant and, at the same time, poetic.  As for Daniel Auteuil's performance, his attainment of the well-deserved Cesar for best actor in 1987 for these two films, says it all.  Finally, Emmanuelle Beart, who also won a Cesar for best supporting actress in 1987, fills the role of Manon with grace.

There are two additional brilliant ""actors"" in the films.  First, there is the picturesque and harsh landscape of Provence.  From the first minute of Jean de Florette until the end of Manon des Sources, we are seduced by the gorgeous images of the Provence countryside, and certainly by the love the director shows for Pagnol's work and the atmosphere it evokes.  The second ""actor"" is the village itself, as portrayed through the different village characters, shown as little vignettes scattered throughout the films.  All these characters bring much authenticity to the story.

The themes of this film are the same as those for Jean de Florette: city versus the country, modern versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion.

Pagnol's message is humanistic in so far as, without ridicule or Manichaeism, he presents the motivations and different points of view of each of his characters.

On the same humanistic level, the story demonstrates that not withstanding apparent differences, such as social, regional or physical, all people are alike and deserve to be treated humanely.  However, in that respect, Pagnol's philosophy is a little naive.  The reconciliation of the villagers with their past wrongdoing toward Jean Cadoret, symbolized by the marriage of Manon, occurs only when they understand that Jean was actually ""one of them.""  So the community of humans beyond differences that Pagnol proposes as an ideal only exists here because Jean ""belonged"" to the village.  As such, according to Pagnol, the village life is idyllic, but for the eventual presence of harmful individuals such as Ugolin and Cesar.

In spite of Pagnol's naive idealism, the films still succeed, because we are ultimately able to tie up all the loose ends, and to reconcile the warring factions through family and blood ties that transcend any geography.",1128816000,5,5560,5.051478641840087

1084229,5,6305812020,"This film finishes the story that was begun in ""Jean de Florette.""  Ten years ago, Cesar (Yves Montand) and his nephew Ugolin plugged up the spring on Jean's farm, causing him to lose his crops and die in a tragic accident.  They then bought his land, reopened the spring, and became  successful flower growers.

Manon was just a child when her father died, and is now a beautiful young woman, living alone in the hills with her goats.  Ugolin falls hopelessly in love with Manon on first sight, and Cesar, desperate for his family name to go on, encourages his nephew to court her.  She, however, despises them both after learning they inadvertently caused her father's death.  She takes her revenge, Ugolin takes a pitiful step, and, too late, Cesar learns a heartbreaking secret.

This very moving story has been compared to a Greek tragedy; it shows the pain of unrequited love, the power of vengeance, and the irony of fate.  Yves Montand is wonderful as the greedy, clever, and lonely Cesar.  I recommend seeing ""Jean de Florette"" first, and then you can enjoy the story's surprising and touching resolution.

The death of her father keeps her from leaving the countryside to seek vengeance on Ugolin and his uncle Cesar, both of whom are responsible for his death.

Manon tends to the land keeping to herself.  Captured by her beauty is Ugolin.  To keep the family line from fading, he seeks out the young woman picking up the ribbon she has left behind sewing it to his heart.

When she discovers that both Ugolin and his uncle are responsible for the death of her father, she commits the perfect act that not only ruins both uncle and nephew, but wakes up the townspeople who have allowed themselves to be manipulated and controlled by Cesar.

1084232,5,6305812020,"Released within a year of each other, ""Jean de Florette"" and ""Manon des Sources"" (aka ""Manon of the Spring"") are often viewed and reviewed separately, but the truth is that they're integral parts of a single story which needs to be seen in sequence for its full impact to be revealed.

Set in the 1920's, both explore the stark realities of the tough existence and myopic intrigue that was an integral part of life in the Luberon's stunningly pretty countryside & villages before the march of time transformed them into ""must see"" tourist destinations. Beautifully filmed and meticulously crafted, their brilliantly effective evocation of the realities of this now lost and very different world elevates each into the category of truly outstanding cinema - visual feasts that re-create what life was really like, good and bad, in what we now see as an ""idyllic"" time.

And, as entertainment? Well, ""Jean de Florette"" wins in terms of having the stronger and most obvious ""plot"", enhanced by Gerard Depardieu's tremendous performance as a man seeking to realise his vision in the face of insurmountable odds. But that is, as ""Manon des Sources"" reveals, only half the story, for beneath the tragedy of ""Jean de Florette"" is a much more tragic sequence of events. Slower, more reflective and, in the end, deeply moving, ""Manon des Sources"" is not simply a ""follow-up"" but the key to understanding the full story on offer.

Individually each ""works"" and, as such, stands in its own right as an excellent film, but it is only when seen together that their true power is revealed. You really do need to see both...",1106784000,3,1609,4.886446886446887

Like a Greek tragedy, everything falls into place, everything is accounted for as fate conspires with character to bring about retribution for those who did wrong.  We feel sad and sorry for Papet and Ugolin, whose weaknesses and ""crimes"" are so like our own.

Daniel Auteuil, who plays Ugolin, is a actor with great range and sensitivity.  He is unforgettable here as a not-too-bright peasant who suffers an excruciating and hopeless case of unrequited love.  And Yves Montand, who plays his uncle is flawless, like an Olivier, as he experiences a very cruel turn of fate.  Emmanuelle Bart, who plays Manon, is very beautiful, but she is also strange enough to be believable in an unlikely role as a solitary shepherdess of the hills of Provence.

Claude Berri's direction is so perfectly paced, so full of attention to detail and so unobtrusive and natural that the film just seems to happen without effort.  Nothing fancy, just show what needs to be seen, no more.  Use no more words than necessary, but all that are necessary.  It's almost like magic, how easy it looks.  The scene near the end when the blind woman reveals the cruel turn of fate to Papet is exquisite in its simplicity and its effectiveness.

This continuation develops the original plot further.  The deceitful farmers played by Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil soon realize that they've deceived themselves as much as the innocent Jean de Florette.  The theme is a complex study of human nature and is somewhat akin to Caine's dilemma, 'Am I not my brother's keeper?'

The cinematography and script are excellent but I was rather disappointed in Emmanuelle Beart's performance.  She's the weakest actor in this film and, because she's unfortunately also the central character, her inept skills have a significant impact on the film altogether.  Her acting is forced and the emotions she attempts to express don't leave a very strong impression.

The second part of this work is extraordinary. You can miss the absence of Depardieu, that's why the director makes a clever less lineal with more surprises and even satirical approach. Remember the miracle water, for instance.

""Sequel"" is a poor description of the film though because this film is more of a continuation and conclusion (think Lord of the Rings series) to the story.

(In the Inferno, those who suffer, suffer in accordance with the ""sins"" that brought them to hell.  For instance, Count Ugolino's story of his starvation and the starvation of his children at the hands of Ruggieri. Ugolino gnaws perpetually on the nape of Ruggieri's neck:  Ruggieri starved Ugolino and his sons so he is eaten by Ugolino eternally.)
The author, Marcel Pognol, grew up in Provence where the story is set and has essentially created a classic greek tragedy in Catholic Provence.  It is a beautiful, haunting story.

Alone and proud, Manon is a shepherdess running free in the countryside, surviving and avoiding anyone and everyone that dismissed her father for no other sin than just being a foreigner. And so, in one hot summer day, Ugolin falls in love at first sight with the naked beauty of Manon. Chance will turn into the girl's path, to reveal the truth about his father's death, she vows anger and silence into her intentions, and again, chance will provide Manon with the exact and necessary means to revenge her unbearable loss. The whole town will be set into despair, and Papet and Ugolin will find each other in the terrible and cruel ways of the destiny they themselves forge, Cesar will face the dead of his name, and Ugolin, the sadness of a love not meant to be, at the end, they will beg for a miracle, and Manon will find true love inside her quest. Arise.
Claude Berri re-prices the landscapes, atmospheres and people from Marcel Pagnol's regarded novel (The Water of the Hill), into a sequel very much worthy of it's predecessor (Jean De Florette), an achievement in it's own right. Bravo.
Captivating and honest, Manon of the Spring is pure and true simple revenge, a classical tale of redemption through vengeance, compelling the simplicity and much worth braveness of one single and justified deed, from there to peace of mind. This time Claude Berri paints with the same brush, different emotions in the same protagonist, the slow breaking point of not knowing what else can you do to save yourself, down on your knees, she will only give pardon because of his love, indeed, destiny has the last laugh.
Again, the cast enters a passionate and intricate work. Ives Montand, portraits Papet with the same accurate eye, only this time, sadness and sorrow are added to the spectrum, and Papet is revealed in his human ways. The amazing Daniel Auteuil gives despair and tragic sense to Ugolin, the result stands in a emotive evolution of the character. Now, we get to see the little girl that was Manon in Jean De Florette, grown up to be breathtaking beauty, French actress Emmanuelle Beart, portraits the young shepherdess with dedicated understanding of such a bucolic soul, a keen and grooving performance, like a wood nymph (her nude dance scene is an absolute delicatessen), the supporting cast stands firm. The comparison with Jean De Florette hurts a little in Manon's script and in some parts of the direction. The screenplay is actually a fine piece of work, but there are some scenes where the development of important events are carried with some easiness along with a pace that doesn't quite fits the rhythm of the story. This little problem could have been emended in the DVD edition with extra footage, but it seems Claude Berri is quite happy with the original Cut, anyway Manon of the Spring succeeds by an exquisite continuation of a simple but humanly complex story, resulting into a piece of inner strength. Jean Claude-Petit limited himself to re-arrange the same music motifs that appeared in Jean De Florette, nothing more or new.
This DVD version has the same audio and visual transferring of Jean De Florette (Widescreen Letterbox Edition 2:35.1, with Dolby Digital 2.0) , a good edition of its feature, again, a new and improved version can do more justice to this beautiful film, but the DVD is good enough to see it without any real problems.
So, this is the final chapter of The Water of the Hill story, a portrayal of intolerance and love is what the whole story is about, and little in Cinema History, such topics had been shown with so much conviction, you recollect what you harvested in your own past, and laments have come to late to make a change.",1068076800,,3831,4.753753753753754
1084270,5,6305812020,"This is not a sequel to ""Jean de Florette"", but the concluding part of the same story, ""Water of the Hills"" by the French master story-teller, Marcel Pagnol.
Basically, it is an epic played out in that typically French way of drama-making: close relationship between the antagonists and the force beyond their control driving the story to its inevitable end.  A sort of modern take on Greek tragedy.  The film also features Verdi's ""Force of Destiny"" as its theme tune.
As with ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" by Rappeneau, the director here had a great story and great cast (Yves Montand shining through).  One uncharitably wonders what little he had to do in terms of creativity in such an ideal situation for any director to be in.
All in all, this is a great piece of French film making.  Highly recommended to anybody who loves good film, but especially for those whose idea of France does not go beyond Paris city boundary or ""Freedom Fries"".  You will have some idea about the French farmers by the end of this film.
By way of postscript, I believe this was Beart's film debut and she is unbelievably beautiful in this, which somewhat disturbs the film as a whole.  If I am not mistaken, she married Auteil, who plays poor Ugolin in the film, in real life (now divorced).  They have a twisted sense of humour over there in France...",1065657600,,1328,4.625531914893617

I don't want to give too much away in this review because being able to view this film as is helps in the newness and discovery of. This storyline takes on so many turns that I found myself sitting glued to the screen.

1084272,5,6305812020,"MANON OF THE SPRING completes the story that began in JEAN DE FLORETTE.  It is not a sequel; it is the second half of a single tale.  Although the first film can be watched independently of the first, neither really stands completely on its own.
The second film takes place several years after the first, and centers on two of the characters from the first film--Le Papet played by Yves Montand and Ugolin played by Daniel Auteuil--as well as a young girl who is now living on the land upon which Jean de Florette lived in the first.  The girl named Manon and played by the exquisitely beautiful Emmanuelle Bart, turns out to be the daughter of Jean de Florette.  Ugolin, observing her, falls hopelessly in love with us, yearning for her in a manner so desperate and passionate that you sense immediately the impossibility of its being fulfilled.  The film deals with her resolve to wreck her revenge on those responsible for the death of her father.
What she doesn't realize is the possibility of an even more potent revenge that lies beyond her control, but which arises near the end of the film.  The two films are great without the last half hour of the film, but it is the last half hour that makes the two-film sequence a truly magnificent masterpiece.  We find near the end revelations that make the story that the two films tell almost impossibly tragic.  I can say no more than this without giving away key elements of the plot.
The two films are both quite superb in the picture they paint of rural France.  The idyllic beauty of the countryside belies the hidden blackness in the hearts of many of the characters.  Yves Montand's character, especially, displays the karma attaching to a petty, mean-spirited viciousness.  If the first film belonged to Grard Depardieu, the second one, and as it were retrospectively both films, to Yves Montand.  Although Montand made a few more films before his death, this was far and away the greatest thing he did in his last years, and in a way stands as the last great achievement in a grand career.  I'm not certain he was ever better than in the last half hour of this great film.
I cannot urge strongly enough for anyone who loves movies to see these two films.  Even those who do not normally enjoy foreign films with love these.  The story told is too grand, and the performances too stellar, not to adore them.",1054684800,13,2366,4.5866983372921615
1084273,5,6305812020,"One of the all time ""perfect"" movies in so many respects. It ties in all the unresolved issues of Jean de Florette. It portrays humanity in a near all-encompassing microcosm. Evil, good, grey, and all gradations in between in a simple provincial village in France circa who knows when? It's universal. We don't have to trouble ourselves about dates. It could be yesterday. It could have happened a century hence. Consummate film making in every aspect. Cinematography, sweeping. Acting, uniformly brilliant. Direction? Masterful. Script? Not many better. Buy this classic and it's predecessor and prepare to be swept away.

1084306,4,6305812020,"While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second.  They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first.  Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, ""accidental"" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime.  My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision.  Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.",1012003200,6,906,4.574074074074074

This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, the story of a troubled young woman who struggles to overcome the impact of a terrible crime on her family.  Beart, who became a major star due to this film, has never been better or more beautiful.  Also, the impact of the crime on the perpetrators is equally profound, a study on guilt and sanity, with Auteuil and Montand acting with equal excellence to Beart.  It is a pity that so few films like this are made.

1084311,5,6305812020,"This gorgeous film is the concluding story of Jean de Florette.  That the two films aren't boxed together is ridiculous, because although they stand alone, taken together they become an unforgettable film experience and a devastating masterpiece.
In this film, the little daughter of Jean de Florette, who knows what was done to her father and by whom, has grown to become a stunningly beautiful young woman (Emmanuelle Beart).  She is a free spirit, a shephardess, and so achingly gorgeous that one of the participants in her father's tragic downfall (Daniel Auteuil) can't help but fall hopelessly in love with her (no mystery there!).  That his love is hopeless and will ruin him is just the begining of the reverberations from the sins commited in the first film that will befall the sinners in this concluding second film.
The other is what happens to the character played by Yves Montand.  I will not spoil it for you, but what comes back on this cruelly calculating old man is something to behold.  Montand capped a wonderful career with his brilliant and nuanced portrayal of this man.  The role, which spans both films, is a beautifully deep performance, and you will be surprised by your different emotions about this character.  It is a full-range performance, and shouldn't be missed by anyone who loves great acting.
Although each film is complete unto itself, it is together that the full artistry and power of the story is experienced.  So if you get one, by all means get the other.
Directed with care and photographed beautifully in the countryside of Provence, this is a visual and emotional treat.  A terrific story of human passions, each is a 4 star film, together they are a 5 star masterpiece.",990230400,9,1716,4.8493150684931505
1084312,5,6305812020,"The gorgeous Emmanuelle B&eacute;art plays Manon of the Spring in this sequel to ""Jean de Florette.""  She is Jean's daughter who comes to realize who destroyed her father by concealing the spring of water in their property.  Their neighbor played by Yves Montand took the land for himself after destroying her father with the cooperation of the man who is now in love with her. Manon thus finds herself being able to avenge the wrong that these men did to her family.  This is as universal a theme and plot, featuring deceit, greed, and revenge and the costs they entail, as could possibly be embraced and it is brought as flawlessly and seamlessly to the screen as its predecessor. Even if the movie weren't worth watching, and it is, Beart herself is a feast for the eyes.  Both films showcase French filmmaking at its best.

7896572,5,6305812020,"This is such a wonderful film it is hard to know where to begin.  Although it can stand on its own, you will enjoy it more - and appreciate the irony of the story - if you watch its companion DVD, the ""first"" part of the story, Jean de Florette.

Jean, a hunchback, inherits a house and land from his mother, Florette.  However, a neighbor wants the land for his nephew.  The two of them  devise a plot to ruin Jean.  By the end of the 1st DVD, they have secceeded.  Manon de Source (the 2nd DVD) is the story of what happens when Jean's daughter, Manon, now grown up, discovers their plot and devises her revenge.

It is a tale of greed and retribution so beautifully crafted that one only watch in it unfold wonder.  The story of Jean and Manon is a moral tale so perfectly written that every piece from the 1st DVD (Jean de Florette) falls perfectly into place it the second.

NOTE:  In spite of the title, this film is in French with subtitles.  If you know a little French, I believe you will enjoy it a bit more.  The part of Jean is superbly acted by Gerard Depardieu (not sure of the spelling here) one of France's national treasures.  His portrayal of Jean, with his energetic gestures, is enjoyable even if you don't understand French.  Yves Montand, as the greedy plotter and . . .  (can't say more without revealing the VERY unexpected ending) plays the villain superbly.  Suffice it to say that the ending is PERFECT.
