7986945,1,B00008V2U4,"First, this is so dated in is hard to imagine they made films like this at one time. Then, the cardinal error of this genre--trying to follow the book too closely.  The acting is poor, the scenery cheap and the general flow of the movie (almost a play really) hard to follow.  Had I not read the book,it may not have made sense.  Buy the book and happily read it.  Forget this mess.",1307836800,,382,4.191780821917808
7986946,3,B00008V2U4,"This is one of the slicker new adaptations.  Many of the scenes are set on the Thames near the London Bridge and the views are beautiful.  The acting is quite good.  For those 2 reasons, I quite enjoyed the first 3/4, but during the last 1/4, as the mystery is resolved, the plot is simply implausible bordering on ridiculous.",1112054400,15,326,4.491525423728813
