8625103,4,B00GNK5BCS,I enjoy both of these films and my desire the have fettuccine alfredo at Christmas time directly stems from The Holiday. I want to give these a higher review because the acting is good the Christmas touches are there but also they both don't provide that Christmas warmth that I look for in a holiday film. Both a great to watch and if I were judging The Holiday as just a movie it would get a higher rating. Christmas with the Kranks however has all the right points but just feels like its missing something.,1506643200,,510,4.378947368421053

8625105,5,B00GNK5BCS,Since the movie wasn't being played on cable channels I needed to purchase the DVD in order to have it for future viewing. The delivery was so quick that I was pleasantly surprised.,1484956800,,181,4.515151515151516
