8104787,4,B000E37308,"The BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL documentary on Brigham Young is a blend of documentary, talking heads, and hagiography.  A deeply complex man, with an enormous ego, Brigham Young is depicted in basically favorable light in this 50 minute program.  His role in the ""Mountain Meadows Massacre"" is glossed over, while most historians fault him for involvement ""top to bottom,"" and his incredible marriages to 50 women are treated as a bit of a curiosity.  It outraged a nation at the time!  Although Brigham Young was indeed the ""first governor of Utah Territory,"" there is no mention of why statehood remained impossible during his lifetime and for score of years after his death (polygamy).  The statement that ""Utah was made a territory to somehow balance slave states and anti-slavery states"" is poor political science - - it is not true.  Brigham Young's significant organizational abilities, his ""design and plan"" for Salt Lake City, and his binding of the main community of LDS into a cohesive group are rightfully credited and expostulated about. The tidbit about the stamps honoring pioneers of the west was curious in suggesting that Brigham Young should have been one of those honored...He was a deeply controversial figure, who actually tried to make war with the US Army, and really wanted an independent ""state"" of Deseret.  The BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL's selection of ""experts"" to be the talking heads was not balanced:  It was mostly Mormon historians and others from two UNArizona and UNM Albuquerque.  All in all, however, it represents an important contribution to an important figure in USA history.

This video is a volume in the Biography series. Given that, it is simply an expos of Brigham Young's life and is neither sympathetic nor unsympathetic. The usual and expected stuff is there: his early life and conversion to Mormonism, the trek to Utah, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and, of course, polygamy.

This video is lacking in several ways. I never get the sense of the greatness of the man. After all, he took over a church whose leader had just been murdered and whose members were being driven west. The facts are impressive: Brigham Young led an early party of 400 wagons with 1200 people to Utah, 16 days after his 1000 mile trek to Utah, he returned to Winter Quarters to organize another group; and so on. In all, he supervised the immigration of 120,000 people to Utah, 80,000 from Europe; he founded 350 Mormon settlements, ranging throughout the West. The towns were laid out in stupendous fashion. The Mormons were simply some of the most successful settlers in the West and that is due in large part to the vision, hard work, and leadership of Brigham Young. With a less able leader at the helm, the Mormon experiment in the West would have failed and they would have been a sad footnote in our history books. He was a great, truly great, leader of the first order. However, I never get the sense of the greatness of the man. The presentation just seems tired and formulaic. Even the host has a ho-hum attitude. The Biography formula has worn thin. Perhaps I was jaded by my recent viewing of the excellent and in-depth video on Joseph Smith. At least, the producers could have interviewed several Mormon leaders. Then we could have felt something for the man. As it is, he comes across as a dull figure, and it shouldn't be that way.",1188777600,,1782,4.60062893081761
8104789,4,B000E37308,"Brigham Young did not found the Mormon Church, but he was primarily responsible for the prosperity of that particular religious community, overseeing the persecuted religious group's westward migration to Salt Lake City and governing the religious community for over three decades. His life was far less colorful than that of the prophet he chose to follow as a youth, the controversial Joseph Smith. It is difficult to discuss the life of Brigham Young without getting into the beliefs of the Mormon religion, but this video provides a good introduction to Joseph Smith's contributions to history and his excellent leadership skills. It does not delve into the origins of the church Joseph Smith founded, but it does follow the growing community of Mormons as they moved west in search of true freedom to practice their peculiar faith. A thriving Mormon community was prone to grow like Topsy and to keep itself isolated, so non-Mormon neighbors naturally tended to distrust the members of these religious communities as they arrived in numbers large enough to potentially dominate local governments. When Joseph Smith came out and sanctioned polygamy as an important religious practice, Mormons really became unwelcome wherever they went. With the leadership of the church in prison, Brigham Young oversaw the migration of the people to their chosen land out west; then, when Joseph Smith was killed, Young eventually succeeded him as the leader - but not the prophet - of the church.

I really don't find Young's life that exciting, and this video did little to help me understanding a form of religion I find perplexing and self-contradictory. Young was reportedly troubled when Joseph Smith promoted polygamy to an article of faith, yet he seemed to get over those early misgivings; by the time he died, he had taken 55 wives and had 57 children. After Utah was brought into the Union as a territory, the legal dispute over polygamy led to an actual war of sorts, with Young eventually giving in and letting the government put a stop to the Mormon practice. Before the conflict was settled, however, a large group of immigrants traveling through Utah were massacred by Mormon men who talked the innocent group of civilians into giving up their weapons for safe passage and then cold-bloodedly shot the now-defenseless men, women, and children. Young may not have condoned the action, but he took his sweet time doing anything about it, and that leaves a pretty ugly scar on the history of an otherwise unusual but less than fascinating man.",1140220800,2,2545,5.045130641330166
