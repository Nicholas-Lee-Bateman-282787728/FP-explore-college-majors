Tony and Peter complement each other beautifully, and they are able to articulate their musical interactions concisely and clearly.  Production values are high, with close-in shots of both players' hands.  Happy Traum is a guiding yet non-intrusive presence on the side as he takes the duo through some of their best combo work.  All ensemble musicians should study this video!",1290988800,4,561,5.5

I have never heard anything more pure. Don't think this is only for
great players, its for great listeners. This has been the go to music
in my house since I received it. Great guitar, great vocals ,wonderfull
songsmanship. Don't be afraid of this because it's a cd, I just pull
the audio off to a good set of computer speakers. I have every record and cd Tony has ever made. This is up there with Tony's last master class DVD
as some of the best music you will ever hear. Congratulations to Homespun
and the Duke audio visual department.",1218931200,6,613,4.339130434782609
8244972,5,B0012BJ0L6,"This DVD lesson featuring Tony Rice and Peter Rowan is wonderful. You can learn several Peter Rowan tunes in detail. Peter's fingerpicking is nice and to the point. Tony's rhythm guitar parts are pretty complex but sound perfect on every song. Tony's lead guitar parts are very hot but perfectly appropriate. There's plenty here to keep anyone busy for a good while.

 Another great thing about this dvd is simply the magic that takes place between Peter and Tony. There are only two guitars, but it's pure musical heaven hearing these two acoustic giants together.

 5 Stars!!",1202428800,9,577,4.917525773195877
