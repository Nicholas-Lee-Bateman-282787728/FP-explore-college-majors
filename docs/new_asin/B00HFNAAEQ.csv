8632492,4,B00HFNAAEQ,"Great collection with maybe only one film I'm not interested in.  Plus with the sale price on Amazon, the total cost per movie was hard to pass up.",1400630400,,147,4.25
8632493,4,B00HFNAAEQ,"This isn't really a review, but I thought I'd include some helpful information about each film here for potential customers, as I notice the Product Description is lacking. I hope you find this useful:

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $38.99, and contains 9 films. When we divide 38.99 by 9, to find the cost of the individual film you're getting, we get a cost of $4.33 per film, a great deal to own this diverse and romantic collection of films. I hope this information was helpful. Cheers!",1397260800,6,2831,4.780737704918033
8632494,4,B00HFNAAEQ,"Giving some props for the collection and hopefully negating some of the low ratings that are based solely on the MPAA ratings. No need to trash a product because you don't like a movie's rating.

However, I wouldn't buy it simply because I have no need for all the movies and know that if I did, I could buy them for far less if I were to purchase them individually.",1394409600,,366,4.228571428571429
8632495,1,B00HFNAAEQ,"Why would I buy this Box if buying all the movies separately would save me round about $40?
Besides I might not want to buy all 9 movies anyways so it'll save you even more $$$.",1393200000,,177,3.9444444444444446
8632496,5,B00HFNAAEQ,"This is a nice variety of mixed movies.
From drama to funny, from sad to happy!!!
Who cares what there rated, show your
children only the appropriate ones.
Life is all about choices, please enjoy
the movies and have popcorn.",1392336000,2,224,4.625
8632497,3,B00HFNAAEQ,"The one rating is another example of someone rating something they know nothing about and are based on titles vice actual content.  All them movies are PG and mostly comedy and nothing is R about any of them.  I would not buy the movies anyway because I don't care for the titles and some of them I already have.

Bottom line readers of the reviews beware of the trash that not only Hollywood puts out but also of the absolute garbage that can be spewed forth by the reviewers.",1391990400,21,477,4.337078651685394
