8368502,5,B002EZIWBI,My class loved it! All the students were able to learn and apply. Hoping there's a series of DVDs.,1430870400,,98,4.2105263157894735
8368503,1,B002EZIWBI,"This video does not actually teach a kid how to use the bible.  Rather, it uses its study method to promote a narrow interpretation of scripture.  As a Christian educator, I want to equip kids with the skills to use their bibles.  This DVD is not that.",1392508800,,252,4.319148936170213
8368504,2,B002EZIWBI,"I had high hopes for this DVD, and planned to use it teaching a class based on the accompanying book. However, after viewing it, I know I'll only be able to use a few isolated clips. In all honesty, it's just *cheesy*. While there's a chance it might appeal to young children (under 7?), it definitely won't fly with the upper elementary/junior high kids I'll be working with.  The acting is ""ok,"" but it's the musical segments that make me cringe. Also, it only covers the first chapter of the book! I suppose they thought that would be all you would need, but...? It's too bad, because it was a good idea that just wasn't done very well.",1370649600,3,639,4.415254237288136
8368505,5,B002EZIWBI,This product is excellent for all the family. I received the DVD in new condition and I absolutely love it.,1305763200,,107,4.4
