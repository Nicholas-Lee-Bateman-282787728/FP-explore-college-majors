4977499,5,B00687JTJ2,"I first saw the show on live TV back in 1959 and it has not lost its freshness. Benny Goodman, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Lionel Hampton, the Hi-Los and more. A great program.",1412121600,2,176,4.363636363636363
4977500,5,B00687JTJ2,Watching this TV special is well worth your time--there are so many great musicians and singers from the swing era--I loved it.,1392249600,,127,4.818181818181818
4977501,5,B00687JTJ2,"The music was really good stuff.  Let's be realistic about the video quality - it was nearly 60 years ago, so we can't expect it to look like anything from 2014.  Remember, in the end, it's all about the music which came across clear given recording equipement & everything else.",1391126400,,279,4.56
4977502,1,B00687JTJ2,"When I saw this was available, I immediately ordered. I remember when I was watching this on a 12 1/2 Admiral TV.
As I recall you could buy it at a Texaco station at a discounted price.

  The sound has held up fine. The video is a failure. Instead of being B&W, it is Grey & White. It is impossible to see anything.

 This was a real disappointment. Apparently no attempt was made to improve the video",1338768000,5,402,4.1688311688311686
8494679,3,B00687JTJ2,"Does THIS ONE have the Texaco / Columbia Records commercials INTACT? The Reel Vault DVD version does NOT contain the original commercials (even though the front cover shows a screengrab from an ad for the Columbia Records ""Swing Into Spring"" LP soundtrack of the Texaco TV program.
Speaking of covers, it appears this DVD from Synergy Ent has STEVE ALLEN on the cover, NOT Benny Goodman!
What's up with the screwed up covers?????? *sigh*",1520726400,,437,4.918918918918919

8494683,4,B00687JTJ2,"This is finally available!  Really enjoyed it.  BUT, that's Steve Allen on the cover, Not Benny Goodman!  From The Benny Goodman Story no doubt.",1458086400,4,144,4.916666666666667
8494684,5,B00687JTJ2,Waiting for the 1958 version also.,1454457600,,34,4.833333333333333
8494685,4,B00687JTJ2,It's Benny and Ella in her prime. Throw in Peggy Lee and what more do you need for entertainment. The Hi-Los weren't at their best so had to deduct one star for that.,1432857600,2,166,4.0606060606060606
8494686,2,B00687JTJ2,I played it for the people care for an it kept on stopping during the playing of the video so we had to shut it down,1428710400,2,116,3.5
8494687,5,B00687JTJ2,Excellent show with real music. It's a pity that the so called music of today fails so miserably by comparison.,1428451200,3,111,4.6
8494688,5,B00687JTJ2,"Such beautiful happy heartfelt music by masters! The video is not great and the sound is so so and that's OK because of the love that's so
evident in this production. Real people playing, singing and swinging naturally with such relaxation. Ella Fitzgerald, Benny Goodman, Shelly Manne, Hi-Lo's, Peggy Lee, Andre Previn, Urbie Green, etc. Check out the Hi-Lo's and realize that there is no auto tuning going on and check out their harmony! Roy Burns is the young drummer with Benny's big band. This show was about music and performed live by musicians...rare now.",1422403200,2,563,4.936842105263158
