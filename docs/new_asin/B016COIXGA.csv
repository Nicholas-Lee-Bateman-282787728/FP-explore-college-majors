8736296,5,B016COIXGA,"For some inexplicable reason the government of Mexico has seen fit to send a bicycle to a small, remote, and impoverished village.  The self-important mayor (played by Gregory Sierra) views the gift as a symbol of prestige and so assumes personal possession of it.  Unfortunately, he is unable to master the art of riding the contraption.  Eleven-year-old Antonio has no such problem.  He loves the bicycle and only wants to be allowed to ride it.  The mayor, feeling threatened, refuses.  A contest of wills commences.  The mayor becomes angry and resentful.  Finally, in a fit of pique he destroys the bicycle by hurling it from a high cliff.  Antonio climbs down into the canyon, retrieves the scattered parts, and reassembles the bicycle, which now becomes his own.  But this is not the end.  The best part of the story is yet to come.  The ending will melt your heart and restore your faith in humanity.

This is one of the best films ever made.  I cannot recommend it too highly.",1508025600,,985,4.7176470588235295
