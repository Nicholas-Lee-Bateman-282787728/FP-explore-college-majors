8637298,2,B00HYJK58W,"Was released in 1995 and also known as Cyberjack. This movie has a nearly exact replica of a hijacked passenger jet hitting the twin towers.  Otherwise, this movie uses profanity against God over and over. I gave it two stars because it is so predictable and overused the lust for sex in stupid inserts simply to take up space where the film maker did not have the intelligence to make a fully rounded movie with intelligent conversation. If you like low budget, low intelligent sci-fi this is a movie you might  enjoy but only if it's free to watch. You might  also like the prediction element. If you can block out the stupid profanity used through its entirety, insert your own scripted intelligent conversations, you might also enjoy it.",1465171200,,741,4.728682170542636
8637299,3,B00HYJK58W,"I have seen Virtual Assassin about 3 times on T.V. and for some reason I like it. I wouldn't call it fantastic, or even a great movie, but it is good entertainment for anyone who likes sci-fi and cyber-based stories.
Michael Dudikoff plays an ex-cop janitor at a computer technology firm  who is thrown into an undesirable situation when a crazy cyber-villain  takes over the building in order to get a sort of AI-based virus. The  villain's actual goal is to incorporate the virus into his own mind, to  become a sort of cyber-organism. The janitor Dudikoff must put his skills  to work to protect the computer firm's employees (including a girl he  likes) and destroy the crazy villain.
The acting is decent, the story is  okay, and even though the movie is a low-budget sci-fi flick, it is good to  watch if you have some free time. Every now and then it airs on the Space  channel, so maybe you can see it soon and decide for yourself how good it  is.",958953600,,955,4.468208092485549
