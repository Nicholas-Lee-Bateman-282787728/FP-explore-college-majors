I am an older guy, late 60's, and in my life I have never witnessed a more spectacular entertainer/performer/singer than Johnny.  His voice is amazing.  In fact, I was listening to one of his songs, on La Cigale, and my wife thought I was listening to an opera singer.  I then told her he is a French Rocker, and she too became enthralled.  Johnny attributes his resonant voice to smoking French Gitane cigarettes for 50 years.  (I hope he finally quit).  He is certainly the equivalent to Elvis, and not surpassed by any other singer, past or present, on the planet.  He has such a powerful stage presence, and commands audiences anywhere he appears.  I call him devastatingly handsome, also.  If you don't do anything else in your life you have to see this DVD.  BTW, every song is in French.  I have no knowledge of French, but it does not matter. Johnny impresses.  Extremely entertaining DVD.",1345939200,,1114,5.444444444444445
8193777,5,B000PY30DU,"A great sax player George Shelby who is from Los Angeles, played with Johnny Hallydays band on this tour and was very fortunate to be a part of this show. I love the DVD even though I don't speak french. The songs are all recognizable in any language. I had watched a lot of video from the tour on You tube etc and was anxious to own the DVD.
One small glitch. It would not play on my big dvd player. It is Pal format and you have to have a player compatible with that. I do have a portable DVD player, no problem there, it plays most anything. I did look around there are no region dvd players available. Whatever you have to do if you are a fan of Johnny Hallyday, the Blues, or Georges saxophone, this is a great show.
