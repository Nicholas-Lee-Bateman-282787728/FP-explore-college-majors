659937,3,6303451586,"Bogie could do this type of role with his eyes closed, and possibly did, but it's far superiour than what many of the actors today can turn out.  It's certainly not the best Bogie ever done, but he's just creating, once again, his role of Rick Blaine from Casasblanca and I can watch this very fine actor do that time after time after time.  Marta Toren as the female lead was good to look at in any scene, and Lee J Cobb was at his pre-""On the Waterfront"" smoldering best.  Zero Mostel was Zero Mostel, what can one say about another master at his craft?  All in all it was worth watching and brought back memories to me of when actors had to learn their craft and not just be good looking with a great body.

659938,2,6303451586,"Humphrey Bogart stars as an American operating in the black market in Syria during the French occupation.  Bogart can't return to the U.S. because of his shady past.  He has no loyalty to either side ... he is his number one concern.  He becomes intrigued by Marta Toren, the mistress of a French officer, Lee J. Cobb, who wants to make peace between Syria and France.  He crosses paths with Bogart several times as both men pursue Toren and become embroiled in the political conflict.
Sirocco isn't a particularly interesting film.  Bogart seems bored by the whole thing, giving a tired, been there, done that performance that makes you wish you were watching one of his earlier films where this type of character and situation was much better played out.  The characters aren't compelling enough to care about, which really kills any chance for dramatic tension.  The script is dry, the direction bland, and the film appears to have been made on the cheap.  Fans of Bogart will want to watch this if only to see him, but it ranks amongst his lesser efforts.",1054339200,8,1059,4.717391304347826
659939,3,6303451586,"This isn't as bad as most critics, and Bogart himself (who said this was a ""real stinker"") have suggested.
It's fairly mediocre, but then not every actor's career can be a gem, and even a solid effort can be  appreciated.  Bogart reprises a role similar to the one he played in  Casablanca and To Have and Have not, but there just isn't much there for  him so you have to take the weight of his persona and film history instead  of relying on his character.  IT works, but barely.
The other characters  let the story down, as sadly is so often the case in Bogart's movies.  It's  almost as though they rely on him to carry the film and don't bother giving  him interesting people interact with.  The cinematography and location  camerawork is pretty good though.
worth seeing, but very barely, and  only if you are a Bogart fan.",964656000,12,828,4.476510067114094

660046,4,6303451586,"I was expecting something in the vein of a post-Casablanca film, with Bogart in the desert fighting against the Nazis.  Instead, the movie is set in Syria in 1925 and Bogart's character is supplying arms to the Syrians who are fighting the French in order to enforce the Mandate given to them by the League of Nations.  The French are facing an urban insurrection and are proposing to execute hostages.  Lee J. Cobb as the French officer in charge of intelligence wants to meet with the Emir leading the insurrection to propose a cease fire.  Cobb has a mistress who ignites Bogarts interest.  Complications ensue. Lee J. Cobb braves death and Bogart's character - like Rick Blaine - has to decide whether he is going to be a man or the weasel everyone thinks he is.

I found the historical elements fascinating, as if they were from a different world, which they were, namely, the pre-World War II world, where France was a victorious military power and viewed the execution of colonials as the price of doing business. The movie was made in 1951, and is based on a pre-World War II book, so the memories of that world were still fresh (and still existed in French Indochina and Madagascar and Algeria.)

Seeing a young Lee J. Cobb is fun also, and he doesn't disappoint in his role as a noble French officer.  Bogart is good also, but this character is not Rick Blaine, albeit he has Rick's cunning and knowledge of the world. The female lead - Marta Toren - didn't make the sale for me.  She seemed vapid, disloyal,annoying and mercenary, which she probably was, but it wasn't a major prop to move the story forward.

This is not Casablanca caliber.  Except for the history part, and viewing this as a kind of Bogart completist, I give this a four.  It was decent and had enough hooks to keep my interest.",1419120000,5,1808,4.563467492260062

660076,4,6303451586,"Although not as good as Casablanca (which it is unfortunately compared to) Sirocco has Bogart playing an American gunrunner in Damascus following WWI. It seems that the French have been granted a ""mandate"" over this former slice of the Ottoman Empire and no one bothered to consult the inhabitants, thus the market for guns. Unlike the Rick Blaine character he played in Casablanca, Bogart's portrayal of Smith makes him a rogue without an ounce of sentiment in him. Bogie's not interested in sides, just what he can get out of this war. A good film but it doesn't have any of the great characters or lines that you see in other Bogie movies.",1358726400,,642,4.6902654867256635
660077,2,6303451586,"Sirocco, 1951 film

Blindfolded men are escorted to a meeting with Emir Hassan. These newspaper men are told why the Syrians are in revolt: for freedom and independence. This is 1925 in Damascus. A peddler can't sell his fish at night. A submachine gun fires on patrolling soldiers. [Did they have them then?] The general orders the shooting of hostages in reprisal! Five civilians for every soldier. Can a truce be negotiated to end the conflict? Can they stop the men who sell guns to the Syrians? The general's order is withdrawn. Men are brought in for questioning. A French officer will be sent to the Emir. Merchants are told to sell their grain to the Army Quartermaster, or else. They have the records on ""Harry Smith"". A man wants to get out of the country. Shots panic a crowd. A flower merchant gives away a free item. There is an explosion, and gunfire outside.

""It's good to be alive."" ""I'm easy to please."" Harry Smith goes out at night to meet a woman. What does he believe in? The Army stopped a cart (it has hidden firearms). A man offers goods to Harry. ""Did you lose a bracelet?"" An honest businessman visits the Colonel to answer questions. Who is running guns? Harry visits Violette, the dancer, and explains his business. He gets around. A businessman discovers who had dried apricots. [The talk of the Colonel carries the story.] ""What kind of man are you?"" He tells her. That businessman talks to Harry. Violette visits Harry, she wants to go to Cairo. Harry gets a warning about those dried apricots! Harry needs to move fast now, and take Violette. Can they have fun in Cairo? A French patrol drives by at night. The truck motor won't start. The soldiers arrive and Harry runs away. ""We have no further use for you."" The general will bring in more troops for this war. A man tells the Colonel where Harry is - for a price. They bargain.

""You look sick, Mr. Harry. You should rest."" Harry suspects a trap. Too late? ""Having fun, Colonel?"" Nasser confessed. The Colonel offers Harry a deal. If he can get to Emir Hassan and arrange a meeting he will be freed. The Colonel and Harry wait for the contact. Harry meets Violette and they talk. Harry is questioned by the General. He is given a pass. Will Harry help the French? It's a long shot. The Colonel talks to the Emir. He wants a truce for 24 hours. But the Syrians question Harry. Will they make a deal? Harry gets a last present. ""The shooting stopped."" ""I wonder.""

This is at best an average story, worth watching once. The story seems confused, as if unable to present a point of view. Most viewers will know little of the history of this era. The defeat of the Turkish Empire in the Great War led to new colonies (""mandates"") in the Near East. The promises of freedom and independence were deferred for decades.

660078,4,6303451586,"The important ""background story"" to ""Sirocco"" is the screenwriter,  A.I. "" Buzz"" Bezzerides, (August 9, 1908-January 1, 2007), an American novelist and screenwriter, best known for writing Film Noir and Action motion pictures, especially several of Warners' ""social conscience"" films of the 1940s.  He wrote such action feature movies as ""They Drive by Night"" (1940) - which was based on his novel, The Long Haul (1938), ""Desert Fury"" (1947), ""Thieves' Highway"" (1949), ""On Dangerous Ground"" (1952), ""Track of the Cat"" (1954), and ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955).

""Sirocco"" is also a ""social conscience"" film.  Many of the key actors in the film were highly involved in the ""social conscience"" issues of the day in the late 1940's and early 1950's.  The key aspect within this film's screenplay is when characters name names, ""rat"" on one another, and everything changes after that.  In short, the storyline was an allegory for the period the film was made.

All of A.I. Bezzerides film noir movies (noted above) have a very cynical outlook on life.  If you thought Bogart's character was a cynic in ""Casablanca""  wait until you see Bogart in  ""Sirocco"" -- he is a totally cynical character who seems to believe in nothing at all.

Another important element in this film is the locale and time frame of the screenplay.  The story takes place in Syria in the 1920's during the French occupation.  There are terrorist bomb attacks, hostage takings, fighting in the streets, insurgents, etc.  The environment is much like today in the Middle East, nothing has changed but the names of the characters.

""Sirocco"" is a ""social conscience"" Film Noir that depicts a very depressing world.  It is a sad story to watch.",1308700800,3,1703,4.98581560283688

Casting his lot between the French and Syrians, depending upon which suits his own greedy plan most profitably, he earns the enmity of both sides...

There were good supporting performances by Lee J. Cobb, thumping his desk as usual as a French colonel, and Everett Sloane as a volatile general, but the film was of little consequence and a sorry end to Bogart's solo production credits...

660082,4,6303451586,"This is a film about the French military occupation of Syria after World War I.  The French were given Syria after the destruction of the Ottoman Empire as a mandate by the League of Nations, and are engaged in a guerilla war with the Syrian natives who are fighting for their independence.  Bogie plays the role of a quasi-legitimate businessman in Damascus who is illegally selling weapons to the Arabs.  This film was not well received by critics when first released in the early 50s, and is still not widely acclaimed by Bogie fans 50+ years later.  As a great fan of Bogie myself, I'm a bit puzzled by this reaction to the film.  While I agree that this is not up to the standards of Bogie's great films, this film is not as bad as it's detractors make it out to be.  This is the type of film and the type of character that Bogie was meant to play:  the gritty, morally ambiguous, profiteer who lives somewhere between the good guys and the bad guys.  In fact, one thing that I really like about this film is that there is a surprising level of moral ambiguity at the beginning.  Both the French and the Arabs claim the moral high ground, and the story line lends legitimacy to each sides claims.  Bogie darts between the protagonists not caring who is right or wrong.  Unlike most Bogie of the best films, he really does lie uncaringly in the middle for most of this film (perhaps this is why it is not well regarded - he really doesn't play a very sympathetic character in this picture, although in the end, Bogie finds his moral compass and `tries to do the right thing').  Overall this is an interesting, if not outstanding, story.  I would give it 3.5 stars if I could (rounding to four because of Bogie and to balance out some of the other more negative reviews).  At $22, this is probably not a film I would recommend for someone other than a hardcore Bogie fan to purchase, but it is definitely worth watching.  Marta Toren, the love interest in the film, doesn't really inspire any fireworks.  Lee J. Cobb does a good job as the conflicted French intelligence officer.  The story itself is very good, although undone a bit by a weak ending.",1149379200,33,2154,4.454081632653061

The abrupt ending is a complete let down if you have invested in the story at all. It's as though the director had no idea how to finish it, and with the movie running way over schedule, the studio said just shoot something quick and end it.

Cobb plays a French military intelligence officer has a mistress that also wants to get out of Damascus and away from her paramour.
