8258328,5,B0015FWQL0,"As a fan (and collector) of exploitation cinema, I would say that ""Grindhouse Trailer Classics 2"" (and volume 1, of course) are a ""must have"" for novices and aficionados of the genre!  From Ilsa movies to ""Eyeball"" to ""Deathship"" to ""The Thing With Two Heads"", this set of trailers (on both volumes) is top notch and the video quality is excellent.  Along with the people behind the 42nd Street Forever collection, I would say that this is one of the premiere trailer compilations out there.  The only problem is its now-limited availabilty.  But if you can find it ... buy it!",1306972800,3,577,4.683168316831683
8258329,4,B0015FWQL0,"Another collection of superbly trashy trailers from various exploitation movies of the 60's 70's and 80's...when HG Lewis, blaxploitation and women in prison flix ruled the drive-ins and 42nd Street. If you enjoyed the first volume, I would say that this does not quite measure up but is still a worthy purchase for any fan of cyberschizoid movies!",1228608000,2,348,5.017241379310345
