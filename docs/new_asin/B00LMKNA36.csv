The camera man did not take into consideration lighting and angle and as a result it makes following some of the slides difficult.  The presenter also jumps around a bit in the beginning and without legible slides it was a bit frustrating.  It was not at all what I expected for the money.

There are several presenters and sometimes things seemed a bit scattered.  Someone I was showing the DVD to even commented that they would never handle a presentation in the manner of this DVD.  At one point one presenter stepped to the side to illustrate something and the camera person did not even attempt to follow them so we could not see what they were presenting.

What this DVD isn't is an end-to-end how to about using ebay or a comprehensive selling strategy.  It sounds great in the description, but was a disappointment.  It does point out a few things you might not know about what types of items are better to sell and how to ship them.  It looks like more money was spent on the open credits (which honestly was too long) than the presentation itself. The audio is just a room miked, rather than taking a direct feed from a mixer, making it hard to understand at times.  It's possible this was even shot with a lower grade camera.

I think the author probably has useful information to share, but would encourage them to do a better job with production before releasing the information again.  If they are making millions on ebay then there is no reason not to make the investment in better production.

We asked for a refund.

Amazon might want to consider including a video sample so people can see what they are paying for beforehand.",1419811200,,1880,4.567164179104478
