5334857,3,B009H3LP64,A huge shark swimming under just a couple of inches of snow?  It should have been set in an area where the snow was at least 5 feet thick or filmed in an area where the ground was completely covered to give the appearance of thick snow.,1365724800,,236,4.0212765957446805

5334862,1,B009H3LP64,"One has to give Sam Qualiana a pat on the back.  Sam stars in, wrote and directed SNOW SHARK.  He also was director of photography, propmaster, a costume designer, editor, one of the caterers, weapons master....in other words, this was definitely a project of love for Mr. Qualiana and I salute you for pursuing your dream and getting SNOW SHARK made.
Unfortunately, this is a very bad movie.  From the horrible acting to the ludicrous effects, there really is nothing to recommend about SNOW SHARK...sorry, Sam!  This is probably the worst shark attack movie ever made!",1363132800,6,570,4.90625
5334863,2,B009H3LP64,"It's been a while, but I finally found another movie that sucks so bad that it's actually good.  Yes, it's SNOW SHARK, and you can tell by the title that this film is very, um, interesting.  Seriously, though, director Sam Qualiana gives a great effort in this low-budget horror flick, but unfortunately the subject matter and execution come off as way too campy to take seriously.

I wish I could have been in the room when the concept for SNOW SHARK was developed.  I can just hear it now:  ""Hey, let's do a movie about a shark...that swims on the land...or better yet, in the snow!""  I'm not making fun, I'm dead serious; I'll bet the production team had a blast fleshing out this idea.

This film is very low budget and it is very campy, however it has heart and some not-too-bad special effects.  I actually enjoyed the film when I quit trying to take it seriously.  If you go into this one without expecting much, you'll probably enjoy it as well.

The cinematography in SNOW SHARK is ok, but the acting is quite bad.  The bad acting is, however, one of the qualities that make it a ""good"" film.  The cast strives to make the characters real, but they just don't have the talent or the experience to do so; the lines come out flat and the emotions simply too fake.  I found myself laughing quite a bit, even during the `intense' scenes.

Surprisingly, the special effects didn't look too bad.  Let me change that a bit: the GORE special effects didn't look too bad...the shark, on the other hand, was laughable.  It simply looked too fake in most of the shots, however there was a single scene where a man is dangling halfway out of its mouth where it looks decent.

I am going to recommend SNOW SHARK, but only if you are looking for a good laugh.  And even then, I imagine many of my readers will probably shut it off after 20 minutes or so.  I would only give this one a look if you have some time to kill.",1361836800,27,1915,4.343661971830986

5334938,1,B009H3LP64,"Any self-respecting quest to seek out the worst movie ever made must go through Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast at some point.  While this isn't the worst movie Ive ever seen, it is bad  really, really bad.  But, heck, you know that already based solely on the title.  Now don't go picturing deep Arctic snowdrifts in your head  this ancient snow beast, despite its significant size, somehow swims beneath two or three inches of snow on the ground.  Even the rapidly decreasing hick population of the town doesnt believe in the snow shark, despite the fact that a local teenager claimed he shot and killed one twelve years earlier.  The evidence was destroyed in a fire, you see.  Nothing kills tourism like wild stories about snow sharks.

It all started with an earthquake (presumably, that awoke the prehistoric shark from his millennia-long nap).  Soon after, a scientific team came to investigate why all of the local forest animals seemed to have disappeared  and disappeared themselves.  Now, twelve years have passed, and the snow shark is back.  The mayor calls in a biologist, a cryptozoologist, and a famed hunter to find and neutralize whatever is killing local citizens on a daily basis.  Locals ammo up and go on the hunt themselves.  Yes, there will be blood  lots and lots of fake blood strewn across the snow.

I cant point to any positive aspect of this film.  All of the outdoors scenes look like they were filmed in somebodys back yard.  The acting is just horrible all across the board  which may be for the best given the fact that the script and dialogue is so stilted and abysmal.  You cant look forward to the shark attacks, either  they usually just amount to somehow hollering as blood is thrown across the camera lens.  On the occasions when we do get to see more than the fin of the shark, you end up wishing you could have just left it to your imagination because its not impressive in the least.  Even the scene with a couple of topless women coming out of a Jacuzzi is hard to watch  frankly, I found the shark more attractive.  Unless you are determined to seek out the very worst movies ever made, just leave Snow Shark alone.",1435881600,,2159,4.61578947368421

Got a bunch of friends together and put on a show for their own amusement.  It's obvious that they didn't waste much time on the script or story, borrowing elements from better creature features.  The dialog, as delivered by `actors' trying too hard to act, is dreadful.  Everyone is overly mannered, stilted, unnatural; their awkward performances couldn't be more stagey.

5335021,2,B009H3LP64,"Written by, directed by, and starring Sam Qualiana, ""Snow Shark"" is possibly the worst shark movie I have seen, making ""Sharknado"" seem subtle, nuanced, and plausible by comparison. Here's the quick version: three scientists are trying to find out what's killing all the woodland wildlife off after an earthquake and end up hunting a prehistoric shark that lives in snow. That's pretty much it. Along the way you are witness to some of the very worst acting ever seen, performed by actors struggling with absolutely wretched dialogue, and wrapped in a veneer of amusingly lame special effects, concluding with an especially bad ending. There are numerous irrelevant subplots, a collection of the ugliest tattoos ever seen in a single hot tub, and a sub-""Deliverance"" shark hunt that goes on way too long.

On the positive side, the fin in the snow is the best shot of the film and never fails to make me laugh. My single favorite piece of acting is from a guy with an eye patch in a bar who howls out ""The shark...she did this to me!"" Though it may not sound that funny written here, believe me when you see it you will involuntarily laugh and roll your eyes simultaneously. (Other bodily reactions may apply.) Despite the fin in the snow and some of the grievous howlers that pass for dialogue here, I would have given ""Snow Shark"" but a single star were it not (slightly) redeemed by the extras, particularly the earlier and even cheaper (!) shark film featuring the worst accents I have ever heard. All told it may be the very worst thing I've ever seen, certainly worse than ""Chickboxer"" or ""Galaxy of the Dinosaurs,"" and making ""Robot Monster"" appear both lucid and well-acted by comparison. The best line in the proto-shark debacle is, hands down, ""Let's kick some monster fin!"" (Let's not and say we did. Is that an option?) There are outtakes which are nothing special (with one major exception...see below,) an especially boring behind the scenes piece, and a trailer. So what's the best part of this whole extravaganza? By far the unbelievably hilarious forced perspective shark puppetry in the outtakes.

The sets were worse than what any one of you could do in your own backyard and the continuity was continually changing.

Other bad movies at least have attractive actors (ROBOT MONSTER) or endearing characters (the kittenish and pleasingly plump 'creature' in THE ASTOUNDING SHE-MONSTER).  The 'actors' in SNOW SHARK consist of skanks and mouth-breathing men who appear to be strangers to soap.  The premise of this movie is not really that bad but the execution is inept, ultra-cheap, and an offense to the eye.  If you must watch this steaming pile, then I suggest you get completely cocktailed or otherwise messed up before you put It into the player.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1375401600,8,1514,5.012

5335052,1,B009H3LP64,"I love B-movies. I love B-movies about animals eating people. Snow Shark is a B-movie about a shark that lives in the snow and eats people. I should love this movie. I don't.

Honestly, I don't know where to start. This movie really was just horrible. The acting was awful, and made worse by the fact that the movie took itself way too seriously. The story was incoherent and had some really lame twists. Production values were bad, as you can hear wind in alot of scenes competing to be heard over the actors. Half the time there is almost no snow on the ground. Doesn't the shark travel through the snow? How's it getting around if there is no snow?

I could keep going, nit-pick this movie to death, but whats the point? The movie is horrible even for people who like this type of movie. Don't do what I did and spend your money on it.",1370390400,3,838,4.2974683544303796

Neighbors could act better. The shark was rarely seen, usually just a fin in the snow, then blood trails. Not a low budget film, more like a no budget film.",1365984000,,317,4.213114754098361
