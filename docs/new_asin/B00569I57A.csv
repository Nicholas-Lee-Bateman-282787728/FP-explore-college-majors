4587656,5,B00569I57A,"This was a fun story that my girls just loved. As with all of the Strawberry Shortcake shows, what I like as a parent is that they infuse fun with educational content. There is always a message that the show conveys and within this DVD it provides such a message also. What I loved about this DVD was how the DVD and the characters encourage the viewers to dream and to think of the future. We talk to our girls about the future and tell them they can do whatever they put their minds to, but I will say that this DVD is a great add-on to our message and I am glad that we now have it in our collection.",1315958400,,603,3.9917355371900825

8459300,5,B00569I57A,"This is an adorable DVD featuring Strawberry and her friends.  First off if you are looking for classic Strawberry Shortcake, this isn't it, but that doesn't mean its bad either.  It's a new version of Strawberry Shortcake and her friends, Lemon Meringue, Orange Blossom and Peppermint Fizz.  In this DVD the character think about their futures but have obstacles to face of course.  The theme is ""Anything is possible if you work hard and believe in your dreams.""  The girls become busy career girls and Peppermint Fizz is the mayor of Strawberryland.  Peppermint Fizz is bossy and doesn't treat her friend's right, but she realizes that to be successful she needs the help of her friends.  It is 45 minutes of Strawberry Shortcake fun and they are super cute characters.  The whole DVD is wholesome and full of great lessons!",1317513600,5,827,4.857142857142857
