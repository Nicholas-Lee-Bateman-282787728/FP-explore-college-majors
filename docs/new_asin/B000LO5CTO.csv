2901380,5,B000LO5CTO,"...it's almost perfect. I always thought of this movie as ""notta fave,"" but I guess I've come to appreciate it more with time. The excellent job by Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock doesn't hurt, either.

Chang Cheh's swan song with the Shaw studios, 5EN is a hyperviolent cartoon of a movie, in the best possible way. With its ninjas out the wazoo, some superb old-school fight choreography, and perfectly suited melodramatic performances by Cheng Tien-chi and Lo Mang, 5EN has finally won me over.

I don't use the word ""cartoon"" lightly - the costumes, the colors (the ninjas representing the 5 elements of Chinese tradition all sport uniforms reflecting their element), the showcase of nightmarish weapons and even some of the editing all add a bizarre ""hyper-real"" feeling, easy to capture with animation, but tricky to pull off in a live-action film. In terms of editing, one specific instance that comes to mind is one of the Wood ninjas dropping straight down, hand-claws first, into the frame, slow as a falling leaf (yet not in slo-mo) - it creates this wonderful tense psychological space between your expectation of physical reality and what you'd see in a series of comic-book panels.

This is one for fans of old-school fu as well as those wanting a more moder-feeling action fix.",1377216000,2,1287,4.949074074074074
2901381,5,B000LO5CTO,This movie is simply a amazing classic Kung-flu movie. I remember the name as Chinese super ninjas but it must have been mis-translated back in the day. Fun for any kung-flu fan,1375833600,,177,4.5625
2901382,5,B000LO5CTO,"I saw this movie years ago - wasn't even 10 years old at the time - and I remember how amazed I was. I'd never seen anything like this before! Awesome fights, strange weapons, hard-as-steel characters, elaborate costumes, sets and props. Disappointingly, I didn't get to see the movie again for decades.

But now the release of the DVD has given me the opportunity to watch it again, and - oh my god! This is the stuff, people. This does what kung fu movies should do. The movie's primary villains, the Five Element Ninjas, display some very cool techniques that - despite the limitations of inherent in the 1982 Hong Kong special effects - kept me very entertained.

One can see the huge influence that 'Five Element Ninjas' had on one of Japan's best mangas, the 1993 film known as 'Ninja Scroll' in English. The major action in 'F.E.N.' starts, like 'Ninja Scroll,' with the brutal slaughter of pretty much the entire supporting cast by the eponymous ninjas.

Another (sort of) similarity: 'F.E.N.' has these 'wood ninjas' who can change their bodies' substances to become tree-like, these 'water ninjas' who attack people from underwater, and these 'earth ninjas' who 'jump' in and out of the ground and can attack from underground. Sure, it's Hong Kong, it's 1982. There are no rock-skinned giants here, or snake tattoos coming to life, or wasp-nests hidden in hunchbacks or anything like that. But 'F.E.N.' more than makes up for its lack of the 'magical' kung fu styles with a boatload of well-choreographed fights and an impressive array of Chinese and Japanese weapons.

For example, the first fight is between a warrior wielding what appears to be a giant pair of table-saw blades with holes/handles in their centres, and the protagonist Xiao Tian-Hao (Cheng Tien-chi, who was also one of the film's action choreographers) wielding a large-bladed silver spear. Looks very cool, but it is far from being the film's best fight.

Plot rundown: (Amazingly enough, there's actually a plot in this one)

Xiao Tian-Hao and Liang Zhi-Sheng (played by Lo Mang, in top form as a bare-handed fighter) are kung fu students, whose Master has answered a challenge from the archetypal evil master of another, evil kung fu school. In the ensuing tournament, Xiao and Liang and their kung fu brothers win 9 out of 10 rounds, but in the 10th round, the other school brings out a ringer: a Japanese samurai.

Although the empty-handed Liang defeats the katana-wielding samurai (this fight RULES and ends with some great reactions from the two combatants) and compels him to reclaim his honour by committing 'seppuku'... this samurai has a powerful friend back in Japan, one who will avenge his death-by-suicide: Ninja-master Kembuchi.

Kembuchi Mudou (Chen Wei-Man, whose icy manner had to be the inspiration for 'Ninja Scroll' villain Lord Gemma) is the 'King of the Ninjas' and the final 4-versus-1 fight against this guy absolutely has to be seen to be believed. In that fight alone, Chen's unstoppable ninja-master pulls out more secret weapons and dirty-fighting tricks than you ever thought existed, and nearly wins the final battle royale.

Anyhow, after receiving the dead samurai's invitation from the leader of the evil Chinese kung fu school, Master Kembuchi comes to the `aid' of the evil Chinese kung fu school, and sends Xiao and Liang's kung fu school a challenge to fight against the `Five Elements Formation,' which is a wholly unfamiliar technique to the Chinese characters. The protagonists are wary, because they have no good info on what ninjutsu actually is, but they accept the challenge. Big mistake.

From then on, it's non-stop action and brutal death. The ninjas fight, fight dirty, and attack the Chinese challengers without mercy (Best fight from this set: the 'earth ninjas' vs one seriously hardcore Chinaman whose character's name is 'Huang Han'). Then they attack Xiao and Liang's school. Then they attack Xiao and Liang's master. And these ninjas don't stop attacking. The Chinese defeat them, eventually, but only after knuckling down for some serious training. The memorable training sequences are almost as fun to watch as the 'Kung Fu vs Ninjutsu' end-fights that come afterwards.

You wanna see some serious martial arts action, all of it in beautifully restored, vivid colour, and boasting a fantastic widescreen transfer? Get this DVD.",1372723200,,4367,5.042995839112344

2901386,5,B000LO5CTO,"As soon as i discovered that this film is on blu ray, i went and ordered this film, with expedited shipping. And i will say that i am happy to be a owner of this film. This film includes some of the best fight scenes, than any shaw brothers film in the SB catalog. The opening alone, in which the narrator descibes the different forms of martials arts you are about to see, derived from many different manuals and techniques/weapons is one of the most memorable scenes to me. The Five Element ninjas while campy, still gives a aura to the film, as the action sequences and stringwork is derived from Wuxia films and it is in full effect here. This combined with the many beautiful yet obviously handpainted drawn backgrounds compliment the feel of the film and succeeds in it. Now keep in mind i am speaking for myself, and i base my opinion on the many films i watched growing up appreciating Grindhouse films and Kung Fu. This is one of those films you will love if you appreciate the aforementioned genres of film i watch.

This film in short, is a fun movie to watch,has many forms of martial arts and weapons represented in it, beaufully shot and choreographed fight scenes, lots of gore (as i read that the blu ray is the uncut version, which was rare to see on vhs in the 80's, a real gem) and to see that they actually got to clean it up, keep the same silly and quirky english dubs from the original release of the film, AND the original language version of the film LOOKING BETTER than when i first seen it, this was a no brainer for me. Lots of good memories of this film, that i had to reown it. Than you TOKYO SHOCK, i been supporting your releases since you were only known as Media Blasters in NYC. Since way Back in the vhs days... :)",1356566400,2,1750,4.303030303030303
2901387,4,B000LO5CTO,"One of director Chang Cheh's last efforts for Shaw Brothers, ""Five Element Ninjas"" is full of surprises and is one of his most enjoyable. Lo Meng (""Gallants"") is the only member present from Cheh's usual Venom Mob but he is joined by the likes of the very acrobatic and talented Ricky Cheng (Chan's ""Fearless Hyena"").  It's hard to say whether or not this would appeal to fans of the '80's Ninja sub-genre (the ones starring Sho Kosugi) as it's very different.  Probably not.  This is more like a typical old-school fu-flick that uses Ninjutsu instead of a Shaolin animal style, even adding Chinese aspects to the Japanese discipline.

Our heroes are in a good-guy clan and win a tournament against some samurai-types. When the last jerk is defeated he kills himself. Prior to his seppuku, he writes a letter to some dude who looks just like him, pertaining to sending out the 5-Element Ninjas for a challenge against the good-guy clan. When the challenge arrives, the heroes' leader dispatches small groups to deal with the ninjas, leaving Lo Meng & Ricky Cheng behind to look after the group's headquarters, where a young woman is preparing to demonstrate the director's misogyny.

I prefer straight kung fu (fists & feet) to ninja (weapons) movies but this is definitely an exception. The fights in this are pretty creative and gory. Full of cool weapons and guerrilla tactics.  The ninjas all dress in rather colorful uniforms to coincide with whatever element they specialize in.  Add those outfits to the painted backdrops and fake trees of the Shaws studio and the picture-quality is almost strikingly vibrant, yet totally silly.  Man, I love flicks like these!

The DVD from Tokyo Shock can finally replace the crappy Red Sun bootleg that fans have had to endure for the last decade.  Celestial's remastered picture is splendid and really brings out the aforementioned kaleidoscopic hue.  Language-wise, we are offered the choice between the old English dub or original Mandarin with English subs.  The only features are an interview with Lo Meng (who finds himself on the verge of re-popularity after one crappy fight scene in ""Ip Man 2"") and some cool trailers.  Very violent, entertaining, and, for fans of bloody martial arts weapons battles, recommended.

2901388,5,B000LO5CTO,"I would not recommend Five Element Ninjas as a blind buy. You have to know this particular genre often referred to as Chop Socky kung fu movies in order to be able to appreciate just how awesome this movie is. It is over-the-top, filled with heroic figures who are willing to kill others and themselves over the slightest of whims and in the bloodiest manner possible. This is not a movie that is going to win any awards outside fun clubs and dedicated websites.  This movie has the thinnest of plots, character motivations and one of the most nonsensical and uneven scripts in all of the late 70's or 80's kung fu movies of all time and that is saying a lot. Still, the action scenes, choreography and the undeniable charm of this movie will win over most if not all fans of this type of genre. If you know what to expect, this movie will be nothing short of a delight to watch.

I have waited for decades for a print of this quality and this blu-ray release is my dream come true and much more. No longer am I forced to watched cropped full-screen, scratched up, grainy copies of this true classic. The quality, considering the age of the movie itself, is pretty amazing and the top notch video quality made 5 Element Ninjas (aka Super Ninjas) that much more engrossing and entertaining to watch. I love the movie even more due to seeing the movie in blu-ray HD quality. I highly recommend anyone considering an upgrade to do so.

2901389,5,B000LO5CTO,"Super Ninjas, Five Element Ninjas, Chinese Super Ninjas, call it what you will, but if you know this title, than you know it is pretty much the greatest, classic kung-fu film ever! Not only is it the best kung-fu film, it is arguably the greatest ninja flick as well. This movie is action packed from the start, and chock full of glorious weapons in action, flowing glue-on facial hair and side burns, and copious amounts of fake gore. And the story is actually pretty damn good as well, not difficult to follow or lost in the translation like so many other films from the Far East. But enough about the movie, this is a review of the Blu-Ray DVD.  As a fan of this film, I have collected nearly every release on VHS and DVD to come out, including all the European import versions, bootlegs, and most recently a Mandarin standard DVD release that included a restored wide-screen version with the original Chinese dialog. This was a treat, because for the past 30 years I have only been able to watch this film in 4:3 TV mode with the English dubbing.  So to see the film in its original scope with the original audio was a real treat for a long time fan.  I figured this version would be the best I would ever see, and that was until this Blu-Ray version came out, which is not only in its original wide-screen format, but it includes both the original dialog audio as well as the hilarious, nostalgic English language track. The picture is excellent, and appears fully restored.  And perhaps the most important part of any good release, is that the film is devoid of cuts and edits.  In many previous releases, this film had much of the excessive violence removed and the film cut for length.  But this Blu-Ray release is pretty much perfection on plastic! This is the ultimate version to own, and I suppose the only additional comments I can make about this release, is regarding the special features, which are not all that exciting, but worth a watch once.",1342483200,11,1960,4.538243626062323

2901391,5,B000LO5CTO,"I had received my bluray copy of Five element ninjas last night. I ordered the bluray preordered since December of 2011. Before getting this version I had a dvd made by an unknown company dubbed chinese super ninjas and it looked like a vhs copy from television. When I was a kid my parents used to take me to see second run kung-fu movies at the cheap theater for a dollar in the middle of chinatown/downtown. The one film that stood out in my memory was this film. I remember the weapons, I remember drawing different variations of the transforming weapons in class the following week. I am now 30 years old, and when I saw how amazing the Bluray transfer looked I was transported back to being a kid again. This bluray transfer is what bluray was made for. Watching this on Bluray is like seeing it for the first time. Great job to the people at Tokyo Shock. This movie is my favorite hybrid kung-fu/superhero film of all time. I hope one day they will remake it for a new audience. But atlas in China this movie did poorly because at the time Jackie Chan with his hybrid comedy kung fu was all the rage and the only people who gives a damn about this film is the over-seas audience.",1331769600,3,1186,4.346846846846847

2901393,2,B000LO5CTO,"Martial arts films often require the viewer to indulge in a certain degree of nonsense (see the villians in One Armed Boxer, for example) but this film verges on Cave of the Silken Web silliness, with fighters in gold lame', ninjas popping out of the ground, blinding metal discs, warriors disguised as trees, absurd wirework, etc.  Typically reliable director, Chang Cheh, went seriously off track with this one and the film's high praise remains a mystery.  (Heroes of the East is another overrated mess.)  Those interested in ninjas should consider the Shinobi No Mono series.  Those interested in quality fu should look elsewhere.  Five Element Ninjas is an embarassment.  Why not do yourself a favor and pick-up one of the many fine releases out there, such as Secret Rivals I and II, Showdown at the Cotton Mill, Disciples of Shaolin (Chang Cheh), Flag of Iron (Chang Cheh), Hapkido (aka Lady Kung Fu), The Victim, or Prodigal Son, to name a few? This is for grade-schoolers only.  The Tokyo Shock DVD -- crisp, clear and excellent as always -- only highlights the unusually comic (and cheap) sets.

I bought this DVD from two separate sellers.

The first time was from Amazon. I returned the DVD because it paused and skipped continuously after an hour or so into the movie.  The second time I bought it from an Amazon seller, the same thing happened.  The first hour of playback, the image is clear, and then the image is pixilated and pauses until the end of the movie.

I sent my copy back and purchased from a different sender and purchased the movie again, but the same problem on a whole new DVD. This is definitely some type of print error on a certain number of these DVD. The movie would be great otherwise, as I watched the mandarin with subtitles.

I didn't realize until I was in my teens that all my favorite  70's & 80's martial arts flicks had been renamed over and over due to copyright issues. However, I recently purchased the Tokyo Shock release of Five Element Ninjas and I must say it is the best I've seen of all the many versions I've viewed over the years. The best picture quality, the best sound quality, and the best cut of the film. What do I mean by the best cut? well from the 80's until now there are versions of the film that differ by 8 to 10 minutes each. Some lesser versions of this film have the scenes out of order. This Tokyo shock version is Top Notch it beats out all the rest. As far as Shaw Bros. films go Tokyo Shock and The Weinstein Company are the only two publishers doing true justice to the Genre.

2901401,4,B000LO5CTO,"In 1982, Chang Cheh's Venom team was no more. His 1982 classic, ""Five Elements Ninjas"" (Super Ninjas), saw the return of Lo Mang, with Ricky Cheng in the lead. Kuo Chui went to Taiwan with Lu Feng & Chiang Sheng to choreograph, direct and star in his own Ninja film, ""Ninja in the Deadly Trap"", which wasn't half-bad. ""Five Elements Ninjas"" not only had Lo Mang & Ricky Cheng, but it also starred Chu Ko (who did the choreography with Ricky), Wang Li, Yu Tai-Ping, Lung Tien-Sheng & real-life former Triad gang member, Chan Wai-Man, as the Ninja leader. Despite the fact that I thought some of the sets looked a little on the cheap side, it had all of the Chang Cheh elements.

There seemed to be quite a bit of research done on Ninjitsu & Japanese martial arts to make it seem more authentic. That part was based on historical literature and literary references from noted Japanese martial artists; it doesn't state that the story is based on historical fact.  The literature is about martial arts, not Japanese culture.  The 22 minute climatic showdown is worth the price of admission alone. Tokyo Shock did a great job with this transfer; remastered, widescreen, behind-the-scenes photos & an awesome segment on ""Golden Arm Kid"" Lo Mang.  You can watch it in either Mandarin (with remastered subs) or the English dub; which unfortunately is kinda lame this time. Either way it's a classic though.",1278720000,10,1399,4.744855967078189

this copy at that rate is outstanding. Therefore, on a standard progressive scan dvd player it will look terrific!!

This copy is crisp with great color and clarity. One of the best and bloodiest of all of Chang Cheh's movies.

2901406,5,B000LO5CTO,"One of my  all time favorite martial arts/ kung fu movies gets a proper American release. The film quality is excellent! There has always been a lacking quality in all subsequent region 1 releases (poor picture quality /full  screen/ no sub titles). The English dub is still the same and while I'm not one to harp on translation and voice acting, the American dub is pretty lame. I can always look past such things as it is not part of the true film itself. I will not go into plot details to extremes because you can read many other reviews on why people love this movie, but here are a few reasons why it tops my list. The plot is fairly simple, the costumes are lavish and super hero like, the blood flows, the variety of cool weapons is unmatched, there are ninjas (duh!) whose weapons and costumes match their element style, there is gore (fighter steps on his own guts/man gets drawn and quartered, etc.), the fight choreography is imaginative, wild and well executed, there are slow motion sequences, Meng Lo is a bad ass, jeez this list could keep going! I still get excited seeing the very beginning open were blood flows to reveal the title (how cool is that?). I absolutely love the first battle scene between the two clans. The top fighters are going one on one to see who is best. Each fighter has a different weapon style. It's just killer! If you own any other version of this film or if you just love over the top wild martial arts films, you need to own this! It is the best version out there. As I've said before if you are a martial arts realist nerd stay away! And while the film is based on actual ninja techniques and weaponry, it is a fantasy, it is a comic book, and it is a lot of fun!

Bonus: Subtitles. During certain scenes Chinese characters pop up in the upper parts of the screen. The subtitles reveal what element style is being preformed (something I have always wondered, never being able to read Chinese).",1267920000,19,1940,4.428571428571429
