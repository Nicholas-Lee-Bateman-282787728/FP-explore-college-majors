8471034,4,B0014THSQA,"This movie is great.  The underground still exists in some parts of America, but it seems the scene is hit-or-miss - so I don't feel bad about reviewing this.  I love this movie, although its a little too slice of life to be considered a lot like a Hollywood film.  Plus drugs.  But this show is well made and pretty well written.  Kind of a drama.  If you haven't already seen Groove, then maybe you shouldn't be reading this right now, but Hey, this movie even has ""DJ Snaz"" from Groove.  I give it 4 stars because a portion of the story is underdeveloped, but this movie is CLASSIC.  If the dvd copies run out, and you still are interested, go buy a thrift store VHS and buy one of those coffees, I mean copies",1417046400,,713,4.229629629629629
