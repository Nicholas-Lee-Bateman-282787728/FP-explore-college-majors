Alfred Hitchcock made many films using the story of an innocent man fleeing from the police with a girl who helps him. It appealed to audiences. Unlike some other mysteries there is no last minute surprise revelation of the murderer. The suspense is in watching and waiting until the guilty party is found out. This scheme is used in many movies to avoid the problem of revealing the ending. The husband is the prime suspect when a woman is murdered. [Does Actual Innocence prevent a conviction? Not necessarily.]",1203984000,,2183,4.491183879093199
