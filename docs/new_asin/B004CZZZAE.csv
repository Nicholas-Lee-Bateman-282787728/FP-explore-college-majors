4331138,5,B004CZZZAE,"If you're a fan of early 1960's British, American, French, Italian, Swedish, Polish, etc. films, the ""art"", or ""serious"" films, esp. those in B&W, you need to know this film. Are you a fan of ""This Sporting Life""? ""Saturday night & Sunday Morning""? ""Knife in the Water""? ""L'Eclisse""? This great Arthur Penn movie is along those lines. (Notice the others I named are all British or European).

When I was a freshman in college, taking an ""Intro to Film History"" course, this was one of the classic films we were shown. I never forgot ""Mickey One"", or Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"", or ""Nanook of the North"", or Buster Keaton's ""The Great Train Robbery"". That's how good this film is; it belongs in the company of the best Bergman films.

And while you're at it, check out the musical score by Gus Sauter. It's one of those quintessential early 1960's jazz (or ""jazz-y"") film scores. And if you want to see another great Penn film, check out ""The Missouri Breaks"".",1317772800,6,962,4.720238095238095
4331139,4,B004CZZZAE,"""Mickey One"" is the 1965 Arthur Penn-Warren Beatty collaboration of French new wave filmmaking brought to Chicago. While it doesn't exactly merge the big shoulders of America's second city with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jules-and-Jim/dp/B0007989ZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jules and Jim</a>&nbsp;and maybe more reflects the neo-realism of Italy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bicycle-Thief/dp/6305081034/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bicycle Thief</a>, the new DVD gives an impression of avant-garde American filmmaking from the era. I first saw this when taking a film appreciation course at Michigan State University in 1972. I wasn't much of a film buff in those days and this movie seemed incoherent and off the wall to me. Almost no one with exposure to modern film would have such a reaction today, although a few might be confused by what goes on.

The plot -- what there is of one -- involves Beatty (he's called Mickey because he steals a Social Security card from a drunken Pole name Miczevsksi and his next employer can't pronounce the name) playing a nightclub comic on the lam from mobsters and hiding out in Chitown looking for a way to re-emerge without being put on ice. This storyline includes Beatty's romance with Alexandra Stewart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zeppelin/dp/6301959981/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zeppelin</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Money/dp/B000038I1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Money</a>), interactions with Hurd Hatfield (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Picture-of-Dorian-Gray/dp/B000OHBCI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boston-Strangler/dp/B0002IQLB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boston Strangler</a>), who plays a nightclub impressario that wants to try out Beatty's act, and various other interactions on his trip to nowhere.

Alan Surgal's script (this was Surgal's only theatrical script; he also wrote a few TV movies) clearly searches for surreal thematic context. The themes seem to be based on the elements of the then-popular philosophy existentialism where man suffers alone in a godless universe at odds with a society where technology seems to control his destiny.

This is played out most directly in a scene where a mime has built a work of art, an interactive machine with corresponding mechanical parts that move balls around, that catches fire. Instead of having a successful happening (that's what the hippies called such as event in the later 1960s), the machine catches fire and the Chicago Fire Department comes in, sprays foam all over the place, and effectively dowses the mime's creative moment in the artistic sun. The aftermath shows Mickey, the mime and others tiptoeing through the remains through a few inches of foam, metaphorically lost in their universe.

Anyone with an interest in American filmmaking or film history should take a look at Mickey One. It is unusual enough to still pack a punch almost a half-century later and it represents director Penn's greatest experiment until he went at it again a few years later with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-s-Restaurant/dp/B000053VAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice's Restaurant</a>.

Unavailable for many years, this early Arthur Penn-picture has now been released to DVD.
Believed by some critics to be one rare example of American nouvelle vague (e.g. Ethan Mordden in ""Medium Cool"" - recommended 60s cinema reading) it vaguely foreshadows ""New Hollywood"" auteurism - soon to arrive with ""Bonnie and Clyde"", another Penn/Beatty collaboration two years later.
Original score (available on CD) composed by Eddie Sauter; saxophone improvisations by Stan Getz.
Cast includes Warren Beatty, Alexandra Stewart, Hurd Hatfield, Franchot Tone ...and yes, ""The Girl"" struggling with the windshield wipers under the opening titles is Donna Michelle, Playmate of the Year 1964.

8424502,4,B004CZZZAE,"MICKEY ONE starring Warren Beatty is a black and white art film, taking place in Detroit and Chicago.  The ""plot"" is cut from the same cloth as some other art films, such as Hioshima Mon Amour (1959), La Strada (1954), No Exit (directed by Tad Danielewski) (1962), and Finnegan's Wake (directed by Mary Ellen Bute) (1966).  I have seen all of these art films.  On the minus side, none of these films have any real plot, with the possible exception of La Strada.  On the plus side, viewers of these films will be thrilled with the impression that they are being very fashionable by pretending to enjoy a black and white movie that makes no sense.

THE PLOT.  The plot, which plays a minor role in this movie is as follows.  Apparently, Warren Beatty has accumulated a huge gambling debt and as a result, the mob is after him and intends to kill him.  In response, Warren Beatty's character becomes a filthy hobo and escapes by stowing away on a train, and eventually shows some interest in reviving his career as a nightclub comedian.  He plays a small club in Chicago, where his subtle sense of humor charms the modest crowd, and he is ""discovered"" and the owner of a large club called XANADU tries to entice Warren Beatty to perform in his club. Warren Beatty has a manager played by TEDDY HART.  Teddy Hart is a short man, and he looks a little weird. He has ""bug eyes"" and he looks like one of the photographs of Danny Elfman of Oingo Boingo (resembling a rabid, deranged moron).  Warren Beatty grows increasingly suspicious that he is being tricked into exposing himself to the mob.  The club owner is played by Hurd Hatfield, who plays his role calmly, but with an insidious aggressive undercurrent.  Actor Hurd Hatfield assumes a lopsided friendly smile, where the lopsided half of the smile takes the form of a sort of defect on the left half of his lips.

MUSIC AND ART.  Music and art play a dominant role in MICKEY ONE.  The music takes the form of a soundtrack played by Stan Getz, known for his ""cool jazz"" style of saxophone.  At times, we hear another style of jazz, which resembles that of Cecil Taylor, as can be heard on his album, UNIT STRUCTURES.  The review on Wikipedia states that the music at times sounds like that of Bela Bartok, but this statement is garbled and wrong.  The art in MICKEY ONE takes two forms.  At about the two-thirds point in this movie, there is a scene where an audience in a wide backstreet are busy watching a kinetic scultpture.  There are whirling wheels, elongated blocks that are repeatedly lifted and dropped on a white-painted piano and thumping the piano keys in an amusing manner.  The entire kinetic sculpture seems about 25 feet from side to side, and in its form, it resembles the kinetic sculptures of JEAN TINGUELY (1925-1991), though there are of course many other artists who make creations in this genre, including Harry Kramer (1925-1997), and Andrew Smith (born 1978).  As part of the ""performance"" of the kinetic sculpture, the sculptor intentionally causes it to self-destruct.  At first, there is a thrilling fireworks display, where sparks spew from various parts of the sculpture, and then the entire sculpture becomes a conflagration.  What I find most artistic, and most perplexingly mysterious, are the generous scenes near the beginning of the movie taking place in a huge junk yard, where the viewer will be treated to huge electromagnets lifting up junked automobiles, and releasing them in large squashing-machines.  Near the end of the movie, we see the same junk yard.  The film does not explain why Warren Beatty wanders through the junk yard.  Another myserious scene, is where Warren Beatty opens the rear door of a junked abandoned milk truck, and inside are three or four hobos who beckon to him with friendly smiles.  The junk yard machinery is artistic in the same way as the images of trains in THE TRAIN starring Burt Lancaster.  A related genre which celebrates the artistic qualities of antiquated industrial machinery is called, ""diesel punk.""

QUIRKY THINGS THAT MAKE NO SENSE.  The film includes other quirky things that make no sense, such as a mute man who smiles broadly and waves at Warren Beatty.  The mute man materializes at regular intervals, throughout the movie.  (I think that this mute man is the same man who plays the artist, who created the kinetic sculpture.)  Another quirky thing is a small brass band that performs on the sidewalk, where a dozen people cluster around singing.  This scene takes place near the middle of the movie.  Similarly, in La Strada, there is a small brass band that marches along for no reason along, in a brief episode.  Also, in La Strada, the main actor is a mute girl.  Yet another non-sequitur in La Strada, is a riderless horse that trots off into the night, in the middle of a village.

FRANCHOT TONE recieves top billing in MICKEY ONE, but his total time in the movie is about two minutes.  We see him at the very beginning.  The man is shown in close up and he is really plug-ugly. He does not have any upper lip.  His nose is small and twisted.  We see Franchot Tone near the middle of the movie, where he appears to be a worker in a butcher shop, and the scene shows carcasses of hogs and chickens.  This butcher shop scene is one of the many in this movie, where Warren Beatty suddenly feels uncomfortable, and he flees out the door (or out of a window) and races down an alleyway.  I admire Franchot Tone's acting abilities, but know him only from his role in THE SILENCE, an episode from Twilight Zone.  In MICKEY ONE, Franchot Tone's role is totally dispensible, and his time on screen is not enough to develop any character.

CHRISTIAN FOOD.  Early in the movie, when Warren Beatty has escaped to Chicago, and not yet settled anywhere, he wanders into a food-for-the-homeless facility that is run by Christians.  The two Christians are a middle aged man and woman.  They were chosen for their rabid appearance, and the man, for example, resembles one of photographs of DANNY ELFMAN from Oingo Boingo, in one of his more rabid and deranged poses.  The Christian woman also has a deranged appearance.  The Christian food episode lasts no longer than a couple of minutes.  It is just one of the many non-sequiturs, which makes this film what it is.",1498521600,,6298,4.67211625794732

8424504,2,B004CZZZAE,"Turkey of a movie.  The only thing worthwhile about the picture is Franchot Tone in his final screen performance, especially the scene where his character tells the Warren Beatty character that the latter's stupid way of running his life has doomed him via the mob.  Mr. Tone's part should have been expanded, since his character is the only one in the movie who isn't an instant cure for insomnia.  Had it not been for him, I would be hard pressed to give this bomb a single star.",1480982400,,481,4.505747126436781
8424505,3,B004CZZZAE,"Something of a heavy-lift, this crazed spectacle of paranoia and fear does
impress in moments, but also grinds on purposelessly. Beatty is great, and
the supporting cast is fine. Stan Getz wails urgently as Beatty flees through
the gritty back alleys and sleazy night world of Chicago, trying to figure what
went wrong. Audiences might feel the same way as this absurdist maze offers
no exit. Final scene of Beatty in the spotlight, and the awesome pull-back,
is striking. Still, for art-house buffs only.",1444435200,2,505,5.023809523809524

8424510,3,B004CZZZAE,"It's not the great lost masterpiece some have said, but it's undoubtedly interesting cinematically. The 'wackiness' is of its time and there are moments when it seems a bit like a black and white episode from The Prisoner. There's no humour to relieve it and it seems very much to be about a man's world.  That might be the problem - the very interesting Alexandra Stewart as the love interest is just that - a good American woman who stands by her genius guy who isn't really a genius but a bloke with mixed-up confusion stuck in a downbeat America peopled with grotesques. Seems like a precursor of the great 70s paranoia movie such as The Parallax View before they could really put their finger on what was the faceless corporation or political class that was creating the paranoia.  Here it's 'the mob' and whatever that stands for. The fact that Mickey is essentially apolitical, and an average comic doesn't help us see the point except perhaps that by the end he has some kind of courage with which to stand up to it all. His admiring gal looking on from the wings of course. Much is made of the cinematography and that is certainly impressive.",1350777600,,1151,4.58252427184466
8424511,4,B004CZZZAE,"I first saw this film on TV in the late 1960's. I was immediately impressed with the attitudes expressed by the script and with a structure at the time highly unusual in American cinema. I found both the use of symbols and the visual atmosphere of ""Mickey One"" to be very striking indeed. I have had to wait decades for the film to become available on home video. I was by no means disappointed, and was made even more aware of this film's unique qualities in the context of American films of its time.",1324252800,6,502,4.351063829787234
