It takes you through many different emotions, showing you that what we do for others effects how some people get through the day.  A smile...coffee...a greeting... can totally change someone's day.  Darren Foster did an excellent job on writing this, I look forward to seeing more movies by him.  I loved all the shooting scenes, the Stanley hotel, Boulder...we need more movies like this. Also loved all the actors n actresses, each one was unique in there own way. This movie is right up there with ""Pay It Forward"", great work, one n all.",1318550400,7,627,4.663636363636364
4504030,5,B004YXDGYG,"""Serotonin Rising"" reveals the secret of feeling good by doing good. This movie is a unique combination of drama and documentary featuring well known, and sometimes reknowned, citizens of the world who offer wisdom about how one can increase well being by doing things for others.  This reality is wrapped inside an engaging, human storyline set in Boulder, Colorado.  I learned about this movie thru a friend, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1304467200,11,439,5.083333333333333
8449014,1,B004YXDGYG,"The intention of the movie was good, trying to show offering kindness to others actually increases happiness in you.  But the story line was cheesy.  How could somebody with a generous heart fall in love with a guy who is so mean to others and selfish?

I wish they made a better story line, since they brought such great starring like Dalai Lama, Deepak Chopra, Donovan and Swami Kripananda.

There are so many better movie to learn the positive psychology than this movie.

If you would like watch an authentic positive psychology movie, I would suggest ""Happy.""

8449015,2,B004YXDGYG,This movie was awful. It was not at all different from those after school specials from childhood. Not a fan.,1355875200,,109,4.5
8449016,1,B004YXDGYG,"A must have for any group home serving patients with MRDD but otherwise this was the all time worst pick and the only lesson I learned from whatching this is that you really need to look at the customer reviews before you rent something. I want my 2 dollars back.

I was expecting something that would have been useful or at least marginally interesting. I got to here a few clips about how helping others makes you feel good something I was taught in pre-school.",1354752000,2,463,4.447058823529412
8449017,1,B004YXDGYG,"I read a review of how bad the acting is in this movie, but it's really the writing that's terrible.  I can understand that everyone's taste and range of life experience is different, so I don't argue with any of the enthusiastically ""positive"" reviewers, but how this grade B farce won any awards anywhere is inconceivable to me.  For a documentary that features so many people whose work and presence I admire, this is about as tasteless a mess as could be prepared starting out with such fine ingredients.  There are kids in high school writing better screenplays than this one.  One man's opinion.",1354060800,,601,4.75
8449018,1,B004YXDGYG,Might as well have been a Lifetime movie. I bought it thinking it was something very different than what it turned out to be. I couldn't watch anymore than 20 minutes before I had to turn it off.,1353715200,,195,4.157894736842105
8449019,3,B004YXDGYG,Not worth the price of rental. There's nothing in here that helps the viewer change perspective or practice new ways of thinking.,1352764800,,129,4.909090909090909
8449020,1,B004YXDGYG,"This is a terrible documentary, it promises too much and it actually has like 5 minutes of interviews with spiritual leaders and brain scientists and the rest is like watching a bad soap opera.",1345334400,4,193,4.705882352941177
8449021,2,B004YXDGYG,"Mostly this is about a very BLAND ""nice"" woman, wanting to get a job at the local news station - and her angle is pitching that they need more ""feel good"" stories.  The woman who interviews her is extremely rude and the guy who interrupts her interview is much worse.  So you follow the story of this rude horrible guy and overly nice woman working on a story showing you snippets of what they use in their story - which are clips of notable people and scientists saying there is scientific proof that (SPOILER!!)--> when you do a good act for someone not only do you increase their joy/pleasure in chemically measurable ways, but you also increase your own, greatly.  This does not include writing a check to charity that wealthy do, but could include giving of your hard earned money that you don't have to spare.  Mostly it's the giving of your time.  So - no big secrets in this movie, but in order to find that out you have to suffer through a crappy story with crappy characters etc.

My advice/recommendation -- skip the movie and go do nice things for others, as often as you are able.  Every little thing counts.",1344470400,4,1121,4.465686274509804
8449022,2,B004YXDGYG,"This one-hour movie (which won the Estes Park Film Festival probably because the movie takes place IN Estes Park), has several clips from famous people talking about how helping others raises your seratonin.  In between the clips are several marginally interesting, overlapping storylines. I selected this movie for download from the ""documentary"" category.  It is not remotely a documentary.  At most there's 15 minutes of expert, talking-head clips and the rest is the so-called storyline.  It's, basically, a ""message"" film. No doubt there are worse things to watch (and put in your head).  Even for $1.99 I still feel tricked that it wasn't a documentary.",1338681600,20,659,5.238095238095238
8449023,1,B004YXDGYG,I thought the acting in Troll 2 was the worst acting but this movie is the new champ of worst acting ever.  The people who made this movie have set back random acts of kindness by at least 100 years. Pushing phoney kindness is really annoying and the people involved in this movie are so full of themselves they can't see the cult tinged stupidity of this airy fairy new aged embarrassment. After watching this movie I wanted to go out and smack people not be kind to them.  Please be kind to yourself and don't waste your time watching this horrible movie.,1338076800,10,557,4.398058252427185
