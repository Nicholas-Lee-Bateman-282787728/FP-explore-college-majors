8301814,3,B001FBPSV4,"What a pitiful situation...a daughter holds her parents hostage to what some of her doctors say is Asperger's Syndrome which some believe is a type of autism.  The daughter creates a unending hell with her hysterical demands, verbal abuse, risky behavior, and an overwhelming unhappiness with her empty life.  Her parents can do no more than acquiesce for year unto year until finally they decide to (spoiler) ""leave"", and even attempt to talk their daughter into accompanying them into the freedom that none of the three have ever experienced.
This is a harrowing, well-acted, depressing, and educative film.  I would have given it four stars if it had provided more back story, but perhaps the focus was meant to be solely on the three nuclear members who, in the end, manage to find a bit of peace after all.
Cast, acting, and script all well conceived and executed.",1225584000,4,869,4.858108108108108
