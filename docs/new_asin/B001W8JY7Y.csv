3824434,5,B001W8JY7Y,"Here's a gem. It will take 75 minutes of your time and leave you smiling.

Gianni Di Gregorio plays the primary caretaker for an elderly mother. Money is tight and they face eviction from their condo in Rome. To keep the wolves from the door they agree to take in the condo representative's senior mother for the holiday weekend.

One elderly guest becomes three and Gianni moves a lawn chair to his terrace to sleep. Everyday life in this cramped condo includes making a macaroni casserole and sharing a somewhat working TV. The senior women are somewhat stand offish at first but after an elegant lunch (wonderfully procured) don't want to leave.

I've outlined the story, but to get the heart, you have to see it. It's beautifully written and acted.",1283126400,37,752,4.7251908396946565
3824435,4,B001W8JY7Y,"Do not let the four stars fool you into thinking this film is not first rate,  The missing star is because the people of the film would not so regard it.  This is a small film.  It is delightful.  Roma in August is not what it used to be, literally.  August was once the month of the eponymous emperor.  When the calendar went to twelve months, even the twelve Caesars could not stop it.  Bene. The year is divided into eights for farmers.  You thought there were four.  But that does not work.  We fit in Halloween, Groundhog Day. May Day and Lamas.  Midsummer begins at Lamas.  The Romani celebrated this day as the early harvest.  For a fortnight, they had a big party, ending on the feast of the Huntress, Diana.  The Catholic Capo di Capi co-opted her day for the Blessed Virgin.  So August 15 has become the Feast of the Assumption.  Enough history.

The director, di Greggorio, had last done a gangster flick.  Here, he sort of plays himself.  He is the star.  He is the dreaded late middle age Mamma's boy.  He has no wife, no work, no dreams.  I love my bella Italia, but I must say that the law had to be made to restrict mothers-in-law as THE primary reason for divorce. Basta!

So, we have the man assaulted by his condo manager. Sound familiar?  He has not paid his bills.  For example, EU 1.600 for electric.  He complains it is an exaggeration.  The manager rebuffs, ""For three years.""  You feel the burn on the arm being twisted.  And there is a load of other bills.  But there is a way out.  He must take the Manager's momma so that he can get away for this holiday.  The poor man accepts and must face his own mamma, saying, ""Do not get Snippy!""  What a pathetic hope, as mama loads her clip.

For those of you who know the Eternal City, the scooter ride to find fish on a Sunday in August, for the great meal takes you all over.  The Swede will enjoy the biker Viking.  There is more to the story such as fish from the Tiber (a frightening thought) at the base of Hadrian's Tomb, known to Tosca lovers; but anything more here would just spoil the fun.

3824444,5,B001W8JY7Y,"Wonderful little slice-of-life movie.  I wouldn't categorize this film as laugh-out-loud hilarious, rather quietly amusing and identifiable in the main character's handling of circumstances that are somewhat beyond him and in which he (and the viewer) ultimately see the sweetness.  Be sure to watch the extras at the end of the movie.  These include interviews with the 4 elderly and amazing (novice) actresses and the star/writer.",1484006400,,432,5.515151515151516

3824450,5,B001W8JY7Y,"Admitted Italophiles, we were delighted with this gentle comedy of life in Rome of the plight of a middle-aged bachelor caring for his mother and, for the occasion of FerroAgosto, three more elderly women.  How they all bond reflects Italian virtues of tolerance and sympathy.

My life growing up in Athens was full of days and nights like this, with aunts aplenty. August there was as in Rome. The streets emptied out, most stores closed, as everyone was taking their vacation, most  to the respective villages of their ancestral families. I loved this movie. Italians and Greeks say: Una faccia, una razza. One face, one race. When Gianni's mother was calling her son, I thought  it was my mother  calling me.

3824465,4,B001W8JY7Y,It's a really cute movie that is really like stepping into Italy. It made me laugh and love the characters. It did suddenly end when you expect it to be midway through a movie.

I did, however, expect the protagonist to explode at any time.  Watching the men work and attend to every whim of the eccentric women made my day. The details of the apartment and the Roman scenes as well as the food and its preparation were exquisite.

3824487,5,B001W8JY7Y,"What a winner!  Immensely human, very naturally amusing, authentic. In this gutsy and original story starring Gianni Di Gregorio, who also brilliantly directs, Gianni is aging and unemployed  and having difficulty paying for his apartment, because he cares for his 93-year-old mother, who's actually quite ambulatory.  He also downs a great deal of wine but never seems unable to be responsible.  Among his many attributes, he's a great cook.  Several men, including his building manager and his doctor, who also care for their mothers , see a great opportunity in contracting out their senior moms to Giani for a national 3 day holiday ( for themselves) .  Giani, with his endless patience, permanently suspended negativity and bias, pulls it off grandly, and the women , who at first keep some distance from each other, begin to bond in a variety of interesting ways.  The sensitive and empathic perspective is touching. The humor Is wonderfully fluid and easy. It's just so good!",1468454400,4,982,5.062111801242236

He agrees to take on three elder ladies along with his dependent mother as a job for perks. Their social antics, visiting in the overcrowded apartment during the heat of mid-August when everyone in the area is on holiday became so ridiculous that he decides, why not have fun with the whole escapade - I still smile remembering the scene when he realized he could enjoy the impromptu celebration even though he knew he was 'had' - great acting in this small tale of normally staid and dependent elder ladies living fully.",1444176000,4,648,4.643478260869565

With no pretenses, the movie lands you right in the middle of Rome, in the middle of August, when the whole city (and the rest of Italy) is going on holiday...except Gianni, his ninety-something mother, and three elderly ladies left behind by their families while they go on holiday. The movie doesn't make any statements or grand commentary about the characters or about aging and death. It just puts you in the company of four older ladies who still know how to enjoy life and Gianni, who tries to both manage and keep up with them while cooking, cleaning,  shopping and drinking a lot of wine!",1444089600,,765,4.583941605839416

3824536,4,B001W8JY7Y,"As usual , if you can't tolerate English subtitles, keep going. This is a foodie movie where the adult son/chef lives with his widowed mom in a flat where the mortgage/property taxes , etc. haven't been paid in a long time. Financial trouble is apparent in the daily lives of mom and son.

They are dragged out of this scenario when their creditors start ""trading out"" lunches for what is owed, mom and chef/son resist, but realize there is no way out. What starts out as a lunch or two quickly evolves(devolves ?) into a boarding house with interesting and humorous twists and turns.

i would recommend this movie if you enjoy food and witty conversation between uneasy hosts and eccentric boarders, each learning to get along with the other for the common good.",1410480000,,763,4.686567164179104

3824538,3,B001W8JY7Y,"MidAugust Lunch is a film set in Rome and tells the story of a middleaged man living and caring for
his elderly mother. Behind on his rent, he makes a deal with the Condo bookkeeper to care for his
mother overnight in exchange for adjusting the books on the condo fees. When the deal goes down,
turns out his bookkeeper also has an elderly aunt that surprisingly is part of the mix. Not surprisingly,
our lead character begins to have a little angina, and his doctor comes to check him out. How can he
repay the doctor? Just so happens he also has an elderly mother that he needs to have watched
overnightthe same night.
This film was produced on a low budget with nonprofessional actors, and it has all the charm and wit
that Date Night should have had. Its a close, personal film with intimate direction and a pace in
keeping with its Italian heritage. Take your time, enjoy the story as these elderly women act like sorority
school girls reading palms and enjoying food and drink forbidden in their everyday lives. Two filmsone

If you take care of an elderly parent, watch this film!  Watch it with your parent!

Best film I ever watched with my mother.

We both laughed all night.
Always good medicine.  We had to watch it several times, and now I've become a fan of Gianni Di Gregorio.

This film has wonderful old lady characters, who saddle one son with their lonely and hungry desires.
I relate a lot to Gianni in this film  (writes/directs/acts) who has deference for his mother, and is at her beck and call.

A human film for the whole family.

forever,

3824542,4,B001W8JY7Y,I enjoyed the movie very much but it was a little too short.  I think the movie could've developed the characters just a little bit more and for a longer period of time. enjoyed the fact that the son was taking care of his mother and do two bills took on some additional responsibilities with care taking older ladies over a holiday weekend in Italy. I got a kick out of the son enjoying the interaction between his mother and the other ladies. There are not enough movies about aging and especially about companionship and friendship among the elder communities. I recommend this movie.,1404086400,,587,4.644230769230769

3824549,3,B001W8JY7Y,"I enjoy all periods of cinema and appreciate slow, character-driven drama. However, I was disappointed in this film especially after seeing its solid 5 stars reviews. The premise and conflict is all given in the preview. Nothing took it to another place or led to any revelations or changes. It was short, and the four of us watching were surprised when it just ended. It seemed more like a student film than a full length piece. I can't even say that it gives much of a view of contemporary Italy, since the action is mostly constrained to the one apartment. Nice acting and well done, but this lunch left me hungry.",1398729600,,617,4.5675675675675675

It's actually a study in anthropology,only its plot is the little bit of sugar that makes the medicine of studying dry anthropology go down. Not that anthropology is dry,but to see it embodied in warm,living,loving characters is a joy. The main male character may appear weak but ,in truth he is exquisitely sensitive to his Mother's needs. He loves her without bounds and this love extends to her friends. He is deeply aware of what makes his Madonna happy.

Highly recommend watching the bonus features, especially the interviews with the actresses who play the flock of mothers taking over his apartment.  It's a fun story and animates the popular view of the relationships Italian men have with their moms.  I would also recommend Salt of Life, another Di Gregorio work with the same actress playing his mother in another woeful tale of the plight of men.",1390867200,2,575,4.767676767676767

Gianni does not agree, and yet somehow, after other people he owes money to find out what he is doing, he ends up with several inconvenient and fiesty old ladies in his care. Each has been used to being the matriarch of their respective families, so there is much jockeying for position along with perceived offenses to delicate feelings and sensibilities. Gianni Di Gregorio directed as well as acted in this film, and it is deliciously good, just like the wonderful wine and meals he serves his guests in the film. So good, in fact, that, just like his guests, you won't want to leave.",1390003200,,888,4.662420382165605

3824565,5,B001W8JY7Y,I really enjoyed this one. Not only is it a fun story but it's a good brush up when studying Italian.

3824568,3,B001W8JY7Y,"This movie received glorious reviews from both the critics and the users on imdb.com, which drew my attention to it. However, I was a little disappointed - I don't think that the film was developed to be deep enough for the subject. It describes couple of days in the lives of the main character played by the author of the film and his unexpected elderly ladies guests. The four non-professional actresses selected by the author/director to play the ladies, look and act very naturally, the town folks and the street scenes are also very natural, but the plot does not produce the desired by the director (I assume) result - there is no ""final punch"", the film just ends when you expect it the least, just ends, leaving the viewer with a question mark in his mind...",1365292800,3,767,4.605839416058394

3824570,5,B001W8JY7Y,"I won't recap the story, which is delightful, but want to add two points.  There is an issue in Italy today of too many young men choosing to stay home with mama so she can cook and clean; the result is fewer marriages, dropping birth rate (I believe it's now less than replacement) and an economy that doesn't have a sufficient supply of new workers.  In addition, like some other members of the EU, Italy is heavily in debt and is outspending what it has - rather like Gianni, who has somehow been living in the condo for three years without paying the fees or electricity or his wine bills or......  Is Gianni's life a metaphor for his country?  Gianni's quandary - how to live and provide social services to the elderly with very little money - is also one that faces the Italian government.  At the end, one of the elderly ladies produces some previously hidden money; again, is this a metaphor for what Italian citizens are doing?

Aside from the serious political interpretation of a light-hearted movie, there is another wonderful point.  Not one of the elderly ladies is a professional actress.  I took this out as a DVD and checked the feature, where Gianni the director showed his travels around Italy seeking just the right elderly ladies.  We get a chance to see and hear each of them in their own homes and that added a wonderful dimension.  Their lack of experience does not mean they did a poor job; on the contrary, they were extremely convincing.

Finally, it seemed to me that the over-arching point of the film was the importance of socialization with one's peers.  That is so important to each lady and they come alive as they experience it.

Kudos to the writer, director/lead actor and the ladies for a must-see film.",1356825600,4,1740,4.6103896103896105

Not being Italian I was charmed by the good nature of these characters in spite of stressful circumstances.  Are they all like this?  If so I want to go there, pronto.  The food looks wonderful, too, although I'm not sure I'd like to eat fish from the Tiber.

A low-budget, small, but delicious film.  Nothing dramatic or sensationalistic...no nudity, sex, crime or death.  Just a lovely slice of life.  I recommend it.",1352419200,2,519,4.677777777777778

This is a superb movie with brilliant dialogue, acting, and directing. Everything was done perfectly, including the music.

Not for action fans, but most people who love foreign films are very likely to enjoy it. As far as I am concerned this is a masterpiece, so it is not surprising that my wife, and all of ours friends who have viewed it agree.

But I will talk about the cast.  I believe, other than Gianni (played by writer/director Gianni Di Gregorio), all of the actors in this film are ""regular people"".  This is in homage to the Italian Neo-Realism movement of the 50's and 60's.

In fact, at the 45-minute mark I suddenly became aware of the perma-smile plastered across my face.  I suspect it'll have that type of effect on most viewers.

Star/writer/director Gianni Di Gregorio was responsible for the screenplay of 2009's sleeper art-house hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gomorrah-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B002M36R2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gomorrah (The Criterion Collection)</a>.  His 'Pranzo di Ferragosto' (literally, lunch on the Italian holiday celebrated on August 15th) couldn't be further removed from Gomorrah.  Far from that film's intertwined tales of the Neapolitan crime syndicate, Ferragosto's focus is around Gianni (the writer/director himself, whose hangdog profile is perfectly cast here), his aging but spry mother, and the apartment they share in Rome.

Over the course of the film's first-half, down-on-his-luck Gianni finds himself tending to an ever-increasing roster of women pensioners, as one Roman after another sees Gianni as the perfect way to temporarily dump responsibility and flee the city.  The second-half of the film is where the treat happens: the camera mostly stays in the apartment as the woman chatter away and slowly bond.  What becomes clear: this is a group of individuals simply starved for companionship and the opportunity for idle, pleasant talk...the stuff of day-to-day life.  When the time comes to leave, well, that's when the movie's real payoff happens.  You won't easily forget it.

Despite spending most of the time in the apartment, there's one brilliant interlude: director Di Gregorio puts himself of the back of Vespa as he traverses the city to round-up the ingredients (wine, fish, vegetables, bread) for the dinner.  He plants a camera on a car in front of two-wheeler and languidly leads it around the city.  No PR or slick advertising could top what Di Gregorio does here in terms of displaying his city's character and quirky charms.",1289606400,24,2119,5.6645569620253164
3824591,3,B001W8JY7Y,"Although this film has won several awards, I find it merely enjoyable, nothing much happens, no great plot.  It is just a peak into a weekend  episode where a middle-aged man Gianni, unemployed, and who lives with his mother.  Gianni runs low of money and through his acquaintances, condo manager, his doctor and earns some money tending to their elderly relatives.

Running time is 1 hr. and 15 minute, and from the words of the writer/director/main actor, Gianni de Gorgio, it is low budget, and a director debut for Gianni de Gordio.  Gianni is a lover of wine, which he buys on credit The premise is a holiday Pranzo de Ferragosto on a hot weekend.  Gianni spends his time supervising the four elderly ladies, including his mother played by 94 year-old Valeria De Franciscis.  He cooks nice dishes, follows instructions for the custodial/dietary care, makes up the beds, and just plain good conversations with the ladies and settles disputes.

The beautiful streets are an interesting view.  Director Gianni de Gordio in the extra features speaks about the budgeting, the choice on which ladies to use in the film.  You will also learn how much of the acting direction is not restricted.  The camera moves from room to room within a house.  This is a simple tender-hearted movie that is best to just observe and listen.....Rizzo",1288483200,6,1332,4.871111111111111
3824592,5,B001W8JY7Y,"Writer/director Gianni Di Gregorio is also the star of this delightful little film about loneliness, tolerance, and seeing the silver lining.  The film glows with a richness of spirit that is very satisfying and humorous and uplifting.  Apparently Pranzo di Ferragosto (or Feast of Assumption) is that holiday in mid August when all Italians head for the shore to get away from the heat.  Gianni lives in Rome with his very elderly and demanding mother (Valeria De Franciscis), broke, with mounting tabs at the grocers and the winery, but he prides himself in his culinary skills with which he keeps his mother satisfied. He spends his days shopping and sipping wine with his old friend Viking (Luigi Marchetti).  When his friend and condo manager Alfonso (Alfonso Santagata) pays a visit to remind Gianni how he is behind in his rent and obligations for the condo, Gianni is depressed but Alfonso has a plan: take care of his mother (Marina Cacciotti) during the weekend of Pranzo di Ferragosto and Gianni's debts will be forgiven. Gianni agrees as does his mother, but when Alfonso arrives with his mother in tow he also brings his aunt (Maria Cali) who also needs a place to stay in Alfonso's absence.  The local doctor (Marcello Ottolenghi) pays a house call to check on Gianni and his mother and in passing asks Gianni to look after HIS mother (Grazia Cesarini Sforza), too!  This leaves Gianni with a full house, a shared television, minimal beds, but they all make do and  with the help of his old friend Viking the two to entertain the three old ladies.  They cook a fine mid-August meal and the old lades dress up and dance, having more fun than they have had since their youth.

It is a slight story but one told with a warmth and compassion that is endearing to experience.  For light but tender entertainment this film is a major winner!  Grady Harp, October 10",1287273600,8,1873,4.714723926380368
3824593,5,B001W8JY7Y,"This is a wonderfully amusing, gentle gem of a film with a tremendous music score to boot.

It is extra-ordinary without trying to be and the main actor (writer/director) is perfect for the part.  His acceptance of his less than perfect circumstances is overshadowed only by his unsentimental compassion for his surroundings.

It is a tribute to life in the very best sense of the word, as it accentuates all the things that finally matter.",1284336000,10,440,4.84
3824594,3,B001W8JY7Y,"At first glance, ""Mid-August Lunch"" seems to be a commentary on how other cultures like Italians take care of their elder family members while we Americans ship them off to nursing homes. After the shenanigans begin with all these old ladies in tow, the difficulty of anyone taking care of their mother full time let alone four mothers starts to make our nursing homes look like fabulous accommodations.

This film by Gianni Di Gregorio stars himself as the character Gianni who lives with his 93 year-old mother whom he takes care of, but he has fallen into quite a bit of debt. When the offer comes along to make his problems go away if he takes cares of the building manager's mother, he accepts it. Before long, he gets saddled with an auntie and someone else's mother and becomes a full-time cook/therapist/server to them at the expense of his sleep and occasionally his good humor and general well being.

The attentiveness of Gianni even when his patience is wearing thin is sweet. His endurance for putting up with the ladies' demands is impressive to say the least. His own mother was enough of a pill before the others entered the picture, but combining all the other personalities and problems complicates the household quickly. Some of them don't get along. One woman is on a strict diet her son put her on to avoid dairy and she keeps trying to sneak macaroni salad since she can't resist it. Another is up till all hours of the night just telling stories about her memories. The third after barricading herself in her room the entire day pouting because Gianni's mother wanted her TV back, sneaks out at night to get drunk and then throws herself at Gianni!

It is very much like taking care of a bunch of children, except that they all have several decades of experience and think they should be allowed to do whatever they want even if they are behaving immaturely or it threatens their health. This comedy does point out some of the positive qualities of hanging out with a bunch of little old ladies, but mostly works the comedy of the side effects of putting all these people in one apartment during Italy's biggest summer holiday, Pranzo di Ferragosto.

Gianni Di Gregorio tells this story drawing from his own experience of taking care of his mother for many years illustrating the loneliness and vulnerability of the elderly as well as highlighting their fascinating wealth of knowledge and experience they draw from that others forget about.

Luckily, it's a very short film coming in at 75 minutes because I couldn't take the stress of Gianni's self-imposed mini-nursing home any longer and it is plain to see why it can be easier to let someone else care for your relative when it is a demanding full-time job. Thank goodness it was funny too.",1283817600,,2768,4.710743801652892
