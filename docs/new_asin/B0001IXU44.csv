8013202,1,B0001IXU44,"When I see Dennis Hopper, I expect a lot, I admit.  But this must have been a case where the director was some reincarnated Nazi.  Next time just let Dennis  do his thing.  The acting was so bad I was actually embarrassed for them.  Not his best.",1387497600,,246,4.148936170212766
8013203,2,B0001IXU44,"This is an interesting crime-drama film with Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forrest; however, the reason for giving it only two stars is because--believe it or not--this Blu-ray issue is very poor, which prevented me from watching it after 10 minutes. I also have this film on DVD, which has a very sharp and clear 4:3 picture.",1374364800,,323,4.785714285714286
8013204,3,B0001IXU44,"Except for the F-bomb, this has all the awe and splendor of a made for TV film. Det. Ed DeLongpre (Dennis Hopper) is tasked with finding a serial child killer without any clues. Meanwhile the mayor (Elizabeth Shepherd) has brokered a deal with the local Irish mafia to find the killer (with no trial) and is using Ed's partner as a go between. Ed also has a poorly written estranged relationship with his daughter Leslie (Leslie Hope) that takes away from the story by piling on substandard writing in cliche scenes.

The opening has some good contrast scenes of the mayor performing a ground breaking ceremony and the bodies of little girls floating in the basin. As the audience we get glimpses of the killer, a man we instantly despise. The film is about Dennis Hopper piecing together clues and attempting to find the killer before the mafia does and decide they want to play god. It is an interesting crime/drama although the ""touching"" Hopper/ Hope scenes left something to be desired.

Parental guide: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1340064000,,1035,4.776536312849162
8013205,4,B0001IXU44,"PLOT: 6 little girls bodies are found floating in water~ soon the MOB and the police are both  out the get the serial killer~

Dennis Hopper and Frederick Forrest are the lead detectives in the HUNT for the serial killer who ""snatches"" the girls in public places~ under the eyes of their parents. 6 bodies later the ONLY clues are the girls end up floating in water and little ""forensic"" evidence left. when one girl is taken in a PETTING FARM AT THE LOCAL ZOO they get a lead~ vague video of the crime. The Lady Mayor sets her own scheme involving the CROOKED police chief bring the local ""mob"" to help find the killer with some bribes added.

 Enter JONNY G~ the pretty boy ""hit man"" who no one has ever been able to nail for a hit. SOON the mob has a clue when on the zoo VIDEO HELPS them spot a PURSE snatcher 'duo' end up with a 'clue' to the KILLER~

soon the police discover the killer has a recording of a dog and uses it as the ""bait"" to get the girls to help them find a missing dog in his scheme to get them alone. AS the hitman and the police end up at the CITY WATERWORKS where the killer who LOVES water~ occasionally we see flashbacks of a white lab coat and man packing his tote bag with ""items"" he needs to attract more girls. We learn his name is MILO and he ends up in a first rate chase thru the city water storm drains with the hitman one step ahead of DENNIS HOPPER all after ""MILO"" add a great twist ending.

DENNIS HOPPER is first rate as the detective who ferrets out the clues but the FUN is watching the HIT MAN Johnny G~ using is GIFT FOR TRACKING HIS TWO LEGGED HUMAN PREY helping to track a serial killer with amazing results. I GIVE IT 4 OUT OF 5. GREAT CASTING AND GOOD WRITING. MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.",1299801600,,1739,4.115044247787611
8013206,1,B0001IXU44,"If you ever wondered how certain movies get made, it sometimes helps if the writer, Ken Nakamura, is also the producer and has the resources necessary to finance the project.  The British might refer to ""The Spreading Ground"" as a wank, whereas Americans, being more tactful on occasion, would label it a vanity production.
The plotting is beyond credibility, way, way beyond.  A serial child killer is on the loose, and the embarrassed mayor, with some important city contracts on her agenda, makes a deal with the corrupt chief of police to hire a lead enforcer in the Irish mob to find and whack the killer, to hush the affair up quickly and to avoid the publicity of a trial.  Thus, the chief of police is actually working against his own detectives and even leaks official leads back to the mob, a factor leading to the murders of potential witnesses.  The head of the mob, named Johnny Gault (professionally played by Tom McCamus), has a nasty habit of shooting people on the slightest provacation anyway, and one supposes that the disposing of bodies in this town is an easy task anyway.  So it's the mob versus the cops as both groups attempt to discover the murderer's identity first.  Oh, did I forget to mention that the child serial killer -- remember him? -- has murdered five children on his first day alone? This fact might make world news let alone give the locals something to ponder.  It might even create a bit more publicity than the mayor would like, if she wishes to hush up her little problem, making all her scheming even more unbelievable -- and unnecessary.
I suppose the director/cinematographer, Derek VanLint, does the best he can to make all this watchable, and considering what he's got for a script, he deserves some credit, even if one occasionally watches the flick with ones jaw hanging open.  Dennis Hopper plays Det. Ed Delongpre, who leads the investigation, with help from his partner Mike McGivern, played by Frederic Forrest.  (I hope both talented actors were paid very, very well. At least, Hopper is given some chance to act, whereas Forrest is completely wasted in a thankless role. Both actors have wisely chosen to underplay their parts in a desperate grasp for credibility, since the story is so over-the-top to begin with.)  Det. Delongpre also gets assistance from his alienated daughter, Leslie, who coincidentally happens to be the mayor's -- you remember the major? -- chief aide.  Thus, Leslie is able to obtain the goods on the corrupt chief of police -- you remember the chief of police? -- and leak this info back to her dad.  It's suggested that the reason Leslie has been alienated from her dad for ten years is that her troubled mother committed suicide and she somehow holds her father responsible.  We never learn why she does exactly, but does it matter?  It's predetermined that father and daughter will make peace by the movie's bizarre conclusion.
I'm not certain anyone involved with this production should rush to put it on a resume, except, of course, Mr. Nakamura, who, I suspect, regards it as the greatest thing to hit the screen since ""Gone With the Wind.""",1056844800,7,3129,4.7810760667903525
