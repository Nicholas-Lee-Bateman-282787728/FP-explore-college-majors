7380847,1,B0141KAAJK,"Atrocious.  I bought this because the cover was reminiscent of those great '80's slumber party movies. Actresses (all cast actually) appeared to be pushing 30 instead of the teens they were supposed to be playing.  The tats & wrinkles kinda gave it away.  Horrendous acting all around. They seemed to be drunk or high throughout. Budget appeared to be in the $2000 range with $600 going towards the phone they shot it on while the rest went to catering. Speaking of, the blood looked like Heinz 57. I am pretty sure it doubled for lunch condiment. Nightmares happen at night, generally.  So why did it appear to be shot entirely during the day?  I love B-movies.  Have hundreds of them.  This is the worst I have seen in ages.",1457740800,3,726,4.5813953488372094
7380848,4,B0141KAAJK,"A group of teen girls are hounded by an infatuated stalker (Massage Parlour of Death's Kirk Munaweera) who harasses them with creepy phone calls and love notes, and once he stumbles upon a mask and electric drill, they'll either reciprocate his advances or pay the ultimate price for their rejection! A retro-style throwback to horror movies of the late Seventies and early Eighties, 'Teenage Slumber Party Nightmare' is B-movie director Richard Mogg's fifth film, and he delivers 74 campy minutes of the girls getting drunk, watching porno, talking about boys, and then fighting for their lives against the killer. It's greatly inspired by the teen horror classic 'Slumber Party Massacre', and there's some nice little nods to the original 'Halloween' as well.

The film is essentially carried by the three girls, and Kaitlyn Yurkiw, Lauren Richardson and Hillary Kaplan all bring great personality and energy to the flick. All the gorgeous ladies have that beautiful yet relatable girl-next-door quality that retro horror followers find so appealing, and their welcome ample cleavage on display never becomes too crass or revealing. A large amount of the movie is made up of long scenes with just the girls talking for minutes at a time (and it looks like they ad-libbed the majority of the dialogue), so some viewers may find a few spots get a little tedious or uneventful. But the girls have a wickedly immature sense of humour, a very natural chemistry together and likable interaction with each-other, so despite some dialogue meandering on from time to time, one of them will randomly offer something so awkwardly laugh-out-loud funny that it's impossible not to love them! Add in cheesy yet perfectly appropriate practicable gore effects, memorable deaths in the finale, a simple yet effective soundtrack of mostly eerie synth drones, enough sexual innuendo to make Leisure Suit Larry blush, and, most important of all, dancing and pajama party pillow fight montages (and bless you Richard for leaving in Hilary's accidental butt shot - with her permission, of course!) and you've got a perfect night of trashy guilty pleasure viewing covered!

As with the Bluray/DVD release of his previous film 'Massage Parlour of Death', Richard provides a wealth of extras including bloopers, raw footage, breezy interviews with some of the cast and trailers, and a 'making of' segment where he discusses not only the inspiration for the killer but talks honestly about wanting to make a better work than his previous movies. But best of all is his lively commentary where he discusses everything from his thoughts on screen nudity, shooting on a minuscule budget and use of profanity, to simple pleasures to keep your cast and crew happy.

Richard provides plenty of bright colour to give the movie a visually interesting look, his dorky sense of fun and warped sense of humour is still firmly on display, and he's constantly honing and improving his craft with each film, especially evident in some nice subtle reflective moments - the scene near the end with the girls playing a game of 'Quarters' with the soft dissolves and warm piano score is really lovely and restrained (as well as a nice tribute to 'Blood Lake'), and the moment where the stalker takes in the environment that the girls were recently in is unsettling. 'Teenage Slumber Party Nightmare' is Mogg's best film to date, another great title for SRS Cinema, and fans who understand and relish the low budget, do-it-yourself horror movie mentality should have a great time with this! 8/10",1443484800,3,3552,5.068376068376068
8729279,1,B0141KAAJK,"I thought I was going to be watching a throwback 80s slasher, but that turned out to not be the case. It's just bad all around. Where to start? Well, first off the cast is horrible especially the gray haired girl. Her acting, voice, and facial expressions got obnoxious after about 15 minutes. Next is the pace. I watched about an hour of this crap movie before the killer even put on his mask and even then, the kills were poorly done. Lastly was the ending. It was just stupid. I wouldn't even recommend this for laughs, because nothing was funny!",1533945600,,549,4.445544554455446
8729280,1,B0141KAAJK,"I like horror movies. Especially corny ones with bad acting and ridiculous story lines. This one isn't scary or funny though. It's just plain creepy.

First, the premise... Three teenage girls get together for a ""raunchy"" slumber party. I doubt that any of the actresses in this movie are under 30, so playing 15 and 16 years olds they just seem totally out of place. Even weirder is the ""bad guy"" in his movie, who is supposedly a 16 yo classmate. He's obviously somewhere in his late 40's at the youngest and has mostly gray hair. Watching him trying to imitate a dorky teenager is one of the most cringe worthy things that I have ever seen. It all comes across like something a pedophile made with his Mom's VHS camcorder.

The dialogue in the movie doesn't seem scripted at all, just inane and pointless. It truly seemed like the entire script of the film was made-up as they went along. Despite the fact that the film was released in 2014 and revolves around 3 teenage girls, there are no cellphones to be found. Just land lines with no Caller ID. Three teenage girls that don't have cellphones? Not very realistic, even for 2014.

The video and audio quality aren't exactly ""professional"" and the whole thing seems as if it was edited on someone's laptop. There was no actual tension in the movie. Besides boredom, the only thing I felt during the movie was pity for the poor three girls who obviously thought that they were going to be in a ""real"" movie, only to wind-up being in this. Honestly, it probably would have been less embarassing for them to have just gone into porn. I'm sure that they would have gotten paid better. From what I can tell, none of them went on to be in any ""real"" movies after this.

I honestly can't think of a single thing that I liked about Teenage Slumber Party Nightmare, other than that it eventually ended.",1528502400,,1848,4.523952095808383
8729281,1,B0141KAAJK,"Truly awful. Only 73 minutes long and hardly anything happens for 45-50 minutes and when the ""action"" starts, it's just so bad (and not in a good way).  Watch the 70s/80s movies instead that this film is trying to pay homage to",1528416000,,227,4.404761904761905

8729283,5,B0141KAAJK,"Another Canadian indie, this time time a Loving pastiche of Slumber Party Massacre. (1982)
Some great surreal humor (the phone gag, the age gag, Marlo's bizarre acting style, etc.).
Likable cast (especially Marlo). Good self-parody (actual ketchup for gore effects). Efficient use of low budget, decent visual style.
IN SUMMATION: If you like campy stuff, there's enough in here to enjoy. I half-heartedly recommend it.",1523145600,,419,5.461538461538462

8729288,1,B0141KAAJK,Im gunna have to say this was probably the worst horror movie in the world (the blood looked like ketchup).
