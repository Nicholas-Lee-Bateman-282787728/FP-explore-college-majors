196489,4,1578482135,"This isn't the best kids movie out there, but its not too bad. Its not just for the little kids this time since it is about young teens. Of coarse it has that red headed boy thats in like every single kids movie, hes kinda weird, anyway theres only 2 cute boys in this one! anyway gotta go 4 now!",973296000,2,296,3.95
196490,3,1578482135,"Okay, I admit that I picked up this film to watch up-and-coming film hottie Jessica Alba, and if you're a big fan of hers, that's probably why you'll want to watch this movie, too.  Overall, P.U.N.K.S. is a pretty  decent film and almost (emphasis on ALMOST) bearable to watch.
  P.U.N.K.S. is an acronym for the heroes' last names: Pasiotopolis, Utley,  Nygren, Kitchen, and Swaboda.  The main hero decides that he's had enough  being bullied by the school jocks and bands together a group of other kids  to stand up for the underdogs, the oppressed.  As a means to carry out  their righteous cause, the group uses an experimental augmentor--or  strength enhancer--that the hero's father helped design.
 On a side note,  as a fan of both comics and professional wrestling, I was glad to see that  the hero's inspiration to become a team of crusaders fighting for the weak  was none other than Marvel Comics' X-Men.  Both the comic book and action  figures were featured prominently in the movie.  Another character is a  wrestling fanatic, and he carries out his fantasy whenever he dons the  augmentor by calling himself the Undertaker, of WWF fame.
 In the end,  it's an ""okay"" movie, but if it wasn't for Jessica Alba, I'd give  this movie at least 3 1/2 stars or a 4.",932774400,7,1272,4.707762557077626
