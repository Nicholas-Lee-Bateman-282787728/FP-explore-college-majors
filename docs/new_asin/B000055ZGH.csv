Unfortunately, every 3-5 seconds there was a nasty loud burst of static in the audio track that was SERIOUSLY distracting and annoying...  maybe it was a streaming issue...  dunno...  never happened to me before...  I may try to watch it again later, but I had to shut it off after like 10 mins...  couldn't take it...",1516924800,,369,4.515151515151516

7931442,4,B000055ZGH,"I had been looking for this movie at a reasonable price for a few years and was surprised that it had been re-released in a brand new edition!  Thank you Amazon!  Either you love or hate those campy Charles Band Blue Moon movies or love them.  I am of the latter persuasion and own several titles, namely ""The Vault"", ""Demonic Toys revenge"" and ""Crawlspace"".  I saw the trailer for ""Stitches"" and now I own it.  The storyline is about a Demon from hell who dons the skin of an elderly woman and appears at a rooming house to recruit more souls to take back with her.  She slyly enamors herself as a friendly and helpful co-tenant while finding out the lusts and animosities among the other roomers only to pit them against each other and thus come to her for help which she gladly provides after they one by one trade their souls for it with the most pious and difficult to recruit saved for last.  ""Stitches"" is a great movie for times when the viewer wants an hour and a half of campy pleasure.",1422057600,,996,4.351351351351352
7931443,2,B000055ZGH,"Ah yes, another Full Moon Production at its best.  Stitches, I must say, really bothered me.  At the end of the movie, the bad guy won and bigtime did she win!  The devil stitches on a human suit and starts taking human souls that she makes into paper dolls.  I thought someone would beat her, but NO! no one does!  This is not a bad movie, but it is a BAD movie--the bad guy wins.  I guess the fact that it got such a rise out of me should give it three stars, but the acting was so poor and parts of it were so dull, I just couldn't bring myself to it.",995414400,,554,3.8584070796460175
