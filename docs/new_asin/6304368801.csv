850538,5,6304368801,"""The Great Locomotive Chase"" was one of my favorite movies when I was little, and it still is today.  This movie is about a true story about the event in the Civil War.  If it weren't for Disney's movie, I would not know about The Great Locomotive Chase.  Information is hard to find.  That is why this movie is so great, for in almost all phases, it is accurate.
  The actors so a great job too.  Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter do wonderful portrayals, but so do all the actors in this movie.  The chase scenes are also wonderfully done as the character William Fuller goes from foot, to a pushcar, and through three engines in pursuit of the Yankee spies.  Of course there is more than just the chase.  The movie gives viewers the background, the planning, the chase, the Yankees escpae from prison, and of course the survivors being rewarded.  A great moment in the movie (whether it really happened or not) is when Andrews and Fuller shake hands at the end; it is great scene.
  I would recommed this for anybody whether they enjoy the history or the action.",1012608000,4,1062,4.46875
850539,3,6304368801,"This was a good film. However, it's a little dated. We recently visited Kennisaw, Georgia, the home of ""The General"". The General is one of the locomotives involved in the chase. If it were not for that visit to the museum, I would not have followed this movie. A lot of scenes in the movie assumed you had prior knowledge of the circumstances. The kids were somewhat interested, I had to keep reminding them about what we saw in Georgia.",1000771200,,438,4.4875
850540,4,6304368801,"The story of Andrew's Raiders and their adventures during the Civil War had served as the basis for Buster Keaton's classic silent comedy ""The General.""  In 1956 Walt Disney produced a more serious and more historically accurate account with the studio's new star Fess Parker as James J. Andrews.  A Union spy, Andrews puts together a group of volunteers who will pretend they are on their way to join the Confederate army, board a passenger train, and steal it.  However, once they succeed in stealing a train they have to put up with its conductor, William A. Fuller (Jeffrey Hunter), who pursues them so relentlessly that you end up forgetting he is not the hero of this particular story.  Despite all the obstacles they through as their pursuer, such as uncoupling a car to send rolling back at the other train and burning another car in the middle of a bridge, Andrews and his men are finally forced to abandon the train.  However, they are all captured and now have to plot a daring escape from the Confederate stockade.
""The Great Locomotive Chase,"" directed by Francis D. Lyon, was filmed in beautiful county in northern Georgia on tracks that paralleled the actual route taken by the Andrews Raiders.  You want to make sure you pick up the widescreen version that reflects the original CinemaScope proportions becuse there are several shots that take full advantage of the larger dimensions.  What is most impressive about Lawrence E. Watkin's screenplay is not just the lengthy chase sequence but the fact that the Confederate conductor comes across as much of a hero as the Andrews himself.  Whether you are an enthusiast of trains and/or a Civil War buff, this is an enjoyable film.  Get a hold of ""The General"" and do a double-feature!",993772800,31,1748,4.8193979933110365
850541,4,6304368801,"Fess Parker (""Davy Crockett:King of The Wild Frontier""/1956)stars as James J.Andrews,leader of the Union spies,who steal a train in broad daylight,from Confederate troops. Jeffrey Hunter (who is probably best remembered for his role as Jesus Christ,in ""King of Kings""/1961), plays William A.Fuller,a brave Rebel,and a Patriot. The Great Locomotive Chase perfectly captures the essence of it's subject,in script,performance,and good Cinematography. Many memorable scenes,including the inevitable Locomotive Chases,an Empty box car sent down the track (on fire) by James Andrews,in order to crash into the approaching Locomotive,carrying William Fuller,amongst others,the actual run up to,and theft. And then the ending,inevitable for anyone who knows their History,never-the-less,an exciting one. About the Transfer of this film to DVD:Anchor Bay have done a very good job! Now this film can be seen properly,the Cinematography looks superb,justified by just the right amount of colour depth,and contrast inparticular,spot-on. Original Aspect Ratio,2.35:1,Sharp,detailed,and only a handful of scenes that show even slight traces of dirt. 4.5/5. The Sound quality of this DVD:Considering the age of the material,i expected the sound on this DVD to be somewhat inferior. Again,as with the picture quality,i was very surprised,it is very clear,especially the speech. No hissing,or distortion related problems,but on rare occasion i did hear a slight glitch in the form of a popping noise,on i think,a reel change. Overall,for the sound:3.5/5. So,as a DVD,The Great Locomotive Chase,has been given very good treatment by anchor bay,having now seen this film in it's original theatrical aspect ratio,so clearly,was almost like watching it the first time,again. A great film,that keeps you hanging on,right until the end. My only real complaint to Anchor bay would be:Where are the additional materials?!",988243200,8,1897,5.927007299270073
850542,5,6304368801,The Great Locomotive Chase is a great movie for kids who love trains and train buffs alike.

Based on a true story, Fess Parker plays James Andrews, a Federal agent sent to the South during the American Civil War. His intentions are to burn several strategic bridges in Confederate territory in order to prevent the South from reinforcing their armies. After commandeering a train in broad daylight, and in full view of an entire Confederate Army, they embark on a historic chase over 88 miles in enemy territory. The conductor, William Fuller (played by Jeffrey Hunter) chases them on foot, rail car, and eventually a locomotive, and the intensity increases as Andrews and his raiders realize their pursuer is preventing them from burning bridges. The chase comes to a head as Fuller catches up while the Confederate Cavalry heads them off from the north.

Filmed in the south and on real railway roads, the film follows historical documentation with names, places, and events. It is based on the raiders who survived and received the first Congressional Medal of Honor to a man. In reality, Andrews and another raider were not given this award because they were not actual soldiers, but civilians. They did however, receive a place in history for their actions. The movie has familiar Disney music and themes, and Jeff York who played Mike Fink in the Davy Crockett films is in it, as is Harry Carey, Jr. If you're a fan of Disney films, you'll love this one!",1496966400,3,1438,4.794354838709677

850862,4,6304368801,"A great live Action movie from Disney's gold age of live action films.  The plot is a true historical story from the Civil War.  The movie would serve as  a great supplement to a history class or discussion about this era in history. The movie stays historically true down to the awarding of the Medals of Honor. The actual train is in a museum in Ringgold, GA.

The movie has a plot that moves along at a nice pace, and is told very well.  The cast is full of some familiar faces from Disney movies of the time, and also westerns of the time.  Headlined by Fess Parker, who fresh off the Davey Crockett fame plays the yankee spy very well.  The cast is rounded out by another Disney favorite, Jeff York, who I LOVE.  Also in the movie is Harry Carey Jr., and an uncredited Dick York(think Bewitched).

So, if you love the era, you'll want this movie because there is none that tell this tale better.  If you love classic Disney live Action(as I do), this is one you'll want to get, it's easily in my top 10 best classic live action movies made by Disney.",1486771200,4,1055,4.282828282828283

851120,2,6304368801,"This movie was disappointing - not the motion picture itself, which is great, but the poor implementation of the DVD transfer done by Disney. It is widescreen as stated, but it's more like mini-widescreen, which you see sometimes with cheap DVDs. The aspect ratio is 2.35:1, which is widescreen, but the whole wide image is formatted down to fit 4:3 (fullscreen). It's like watching a widescreen movie enclosed in a small, rectangular 4x3 black box.  There are wide black bars on all four sides of the picture, which is small on the screen. They would have done better to just use Pan & Scan and at least fill out the 4:3 format. Your television may have options to blow up the image some, but the results will be very coarse. Here's some basic data on the video properties of this DVD.  Either Disney goofed this up or I got a knock-off from Amazon, which I doubt because other sites have reported the following properties which make me think it is a knock-off:

The movie is based on a real incident during the American Civil War that resulted in the presentation of the first Congressional Medal of Honor. Parker is the leader of a group of a secret Union Commando type unit.  Their mission is to steel a train and then destroy a number of rail road bridges along the Confederate railroad in the hopes of slowing down the confederate army's mobility. Opposing his is William Fuller, a railroad conductor who wants his train back.  Fuller is played by Jeffery Hunter, Jesus in the Kings of Kings and better known to Star Trek fans as Captain Christopher Pike, the first Captain of the USS Enterprise. The movie could have been a bit more suspenseful and would have benefited a bit more energy from Parker, but overall it is a good movie.",1439510400,,927,4.6

851318,4,6304368801,"This movie was not the success that Walt Disney had hoped it would be.  The cause for this is believed to be because the plot features a historic event rather than focusing on the characters involved.  Plus, it was noted that the movie is decidedly downbeat in that the mission they were sent on was a complete failure and several of the men involved were caught and subsequently hanged.  Receiving medals for a botched effort seems a bit absurd.  It's easier to celebrate a success.  In this case, the man who triumphed over the Yankee soldiers, against great odds, was William A. Fuller (Jeffrey Hunter) the conductor of the Confederate train they tried to steal.  But this movie wasn't about him, it was about the Yankee soldiers who tried to wreck the railroad but didn't/couldn't.  Apparently, you do get prizes (the Medal of Honor) for at least trying.

Still, the vain attempt to abscond with a train is a fascinating exercise in futility.  It's highly entertaining just for the action sequences and the tantalizing possibility.  If only they had been better organized and didn't have dissension in their ranks, they might just have gotten away with it.  Unfortunately, these guys had a lot to learn about sabotage that their on the job training didn't supply.

851520,4,6304368801,"I hear this movie is based on the true story, so history is very interesting.  The time was during the Civil War in the United States.  However, this film does not show you  the brutal battle scenes, but the mission of the Northern soldiers, who disguised themselves as ordinary citizens and managed to steal a locomotive train, aiming to burn an important bridge along the track.  It is moderately thrilling to watch the chase between the the soldiers from the North and the sheriff & co. from the South, against the background of the beautiful countryside.  You will see a totally different kind of adventure and suspense if you have been used to the recent action movies featuring a super-human hero,  bullet-like running cars, flaming-up buildings and so on.  What impressed me above all is:  there is NO violence in this film (because this is a classical Disney movie!).  When soliders fire a gun, nobody is hit and wounded.  They fight only with their fists!  Relieved and refreshing!!",1415404800,4,991,4.839285714285714

This is a fairly accurate retelling of actual events based on the real Great Locomotive Chase of 1862. Even though this is a Walt Disney film it less Disney and mainstream to the filming of that era. I think this is a result of an effort to get the film as historically accurate as possible, so it has a different look and feel to it from other Walt Disney classic. Yet, the one highly identifiable visual link to Disney was the casting of Fess Parker as as James J. Andrews. Fess Parker at that time was incredibly popular playing Davy Crockett in the Walt Disney television productions.

I was lucky enough (as was my wife) to have had the producer and writer of the film, Lawrence Edward Watkin, as a professor when he retired from Disney to teach at Cal State Fullerton.  He was our favorite teacher.  We didn't know each other at the time.  This is a good, tight story based on Andrew's Raiders attempt to disrupt the Confederate railroad lines to bring about an early end yo the Civil War.  The cast is solid: Fess Parker without a coonskin cap, Jeffrey Hunter, and Kenneth Tobey (in my opinion, under-appreciated through his long career).  Very enjoyable.  Plenty of action.  But then again, I am biased.  Lawrence Edward Watkin, by the way, wrote the novel ""On Borrowed Time"" which was turned into a stage play and made into a classic MGM film in 1939.  Walt Disney read the book and ended up hiring Watkin who worked for him from 1940 to the early 1960's.",1400716800,,921,4.461077844311378

852092,4,6304368801,"If one is interested in the history told in this story, one should read the more serious historical publications, as much ""Theatrical License"" has been taken with the story in the production of this film.  Andrews's Raiders did somewhat more damage than the film suggests, and the fate of the prisoners is more complex.  Under the military law of the time, the civilian members of the team, including James Andrews were hanged as spies.  The members of the Union Army were not hanged nor so threatened.  Instead, though some of them escaped, some also were kept in prison throughout the war and others were later exchanged for Confederate officers held prisoner by the Union.  This movie was filmed in and around my home town in North Georgia on a well-known rural railroad--still in operation at that time--called the Tallulah Falls Railroad.  There are many nostalgic scenes, and even some extras recruited from among the locals, that I remember from the 1940s and early 1950s.  And all the antique railroad equipment, thanks to Walt Disney's enthusiasms, are genuine.  On the whole, it's a great film and a relaxing watch.

852189,3,6304368801,"I have read and studied the Andrew's Raid since the early 1960's. Even though the film was made it 1955, I never saw it untill 1983 on The Disney Channel. (I copied it on VHS tape at that time) It was nice that Walt Disney made this movie on ""The Great Locomotive Chase"" based on Andrew's Raid, stealing The Western and Atlantic Railroad's engine The General"" and running north towards Chattanooga burning the bridges on the railroad line and cutting suppies off from Atlata to Chatanooga in April, 1862. Unfortunatly, they used raider William Pittenger's accounts, one of many he would spend his life writing, and all somewhat inaccurate and self serving. If you really do not know the actual facts on the raid, you will come away with a TOTALLY unhistoric perception of what really happened. The movie starts with William Pittenger receiving ""The Congressional Medal of Honor"" by Secretary of War Edward Stanton. In reallity, it is ""The Medal of Honor"" and the first person to receive it was raider Jacob Parott. Pittenger is portrayed as a leader of the ""soldiers"", all from Ohio Regiments and on equal footing with their civilan leader James J. Andrews. In truth, Pittenger was a fragile, near-sighted corporal inside one of the boxcars during the entire chase. William Campbell is shown as a soldier when in reality he was only a civilian, just like Andrews. The movie shows the terrible rain storms (it rained for 10 straight days) that the raiders had to enture, making their way from Union lines 200 miles south to Marriettia, GA. But, the day of the actual ""stealing the engine at Big Shanty (now Kennesaw, GA) and running north, the weather is clear and sunny. In the movie, Andrews remarks, that they finnaly have a nice day, when in reality, it raining hard ALL day. The movie also lends creedance to the myths (started by Pittenger's books) on the ""flying engine"" over the broken rail, the burning/blazing boxcar in one of the bridges and the chasing Confederate Cavalry. None of these things EVER occurred, and it glosses over (does not even cover) the horrible prison conditions the captured raiders suffered for the next 11 months. Nor does it show that 8 raiders, including James J Andrews, were hung in Atlanta, (Andrews was actually ""stangled"" in a boched hanging).  The others either escaped from southern prisons or were exchanged as prisoners of war later. Also, it does not include the fact that Pittenger himself ""testified"" against his fellow raiders during their ""trial."" Entertaining.... YES. As they actually used REAL 1860 locomotives that were painted the correct colors of the W&A RR (orange and green). The General, now in the Southern Museum of Civil War and Railroad History in Kennesaw, GA (next to the  actual spot, Andrews and his raiders stole her in April, 1862) is now incorrectly painted red and black, as is The Texas, the engine finnally used to catch the raiders (now in The Altanta Cyclorama building), but historically, it is FILLED with inaccuracies, half truths and myths. The better movie is Disney's ""The Making of the Great Locamotive Chase"" which is more entertaining, if you are able to find it. Again, I taped it from The Disney Channel in the 1980's.",1355529600,,3205,4.868131868131868

What I liked most about this movie was the way that both sides were humanized.  We could root for the raiders but also root for the conductor, Mr. Fuller.  My mother's family on her mother's side is from Kentucky and had people on both sides of the war (even in the same household...and they fought in some of the same battles on opposite sides).  My mother's father's family were Pittengers, my mom's maiden name, so it was thrilling to see a movie that had one of my own cousins in it (1st cousin 4x removed)!

The pros for me is that there is a lot of authentic looking Civil War era locomotives and rolling stock in the movie. Fess Parker is good, if not too understated in his role. He is not a Davy Crockett type at all, which is what I feared.

The cons are that the movie is slow to start and that, after finally revving up and getting to get somewhere, it runs out of steam (yes, I said that tired, old cliche) just when it is getting good. Well, history does that at times, I guess. I think the movie could have been written better (this out of someone who has never written a movie script, much less an historical movie script).

My trouble was one of expectations. I remembered more action and more train chase scenes. Perhaps I was remembering the Buster Keaton movie instead.

I agree that the Disney company did an injustice to this film that I am certain Walt spent many a day contemplating.

There is NO WAY that a movie like this will ever, or could ever be done again! The B&O railroad museum wouldn't loan out locomotives, there are no places left in the south that look remotely like this that aren't ""modernized,"" (The T.F.R.R. was taken up only a few years after this was made) and the Federal Railroad Administration would have a field day with all the things that could possibly be ""unsafe"" from the old style journal boxes on the boxcars that aren't allowed anymore, and I could go on...

Fess Parker plays the leader of the Union agents whose mission is to steal a train and cut a key Confederate rail line in Georgia.  The Southern railroad honcho who tries foiling Andrews is Jeffrey Hunter. GLC was his next role after playing John Wayne's ""nephew"" in John Ford's western classic ""The Searchers"".  (Trivia: Who played his girlfriend in the movie?) This reviewer believes JH far outshines Parker and the rest of the cast. The action is constant here as Hunter's train relentlessly pursues Andrews and his men. Railfans (not ""train buffs""!) will love the switching of cars, setting of sidings and stoking the fires on the fine old cars provided by the B&O RR Museum in Baltimore. Smell that coal, smoke, valve oil and steam! There is also nice Southern atmosphere, especially those old stations. What happens? A good review doesn't reveal resolutions, but the pace does slow a bit later in the movie, prompting this reviewer to deduct a star from the rating above. Though it is no fault of the movie, the child in this observer remembers a different resolution from when he saw the film during its' initial run. Perhaps Disney released different versions.

852527,4,6304368801,"Based on true events, The Great Locomotive Chase is a Disney movie that has never gotten the recognition like some others, notably the Davy Crockett series, but it is an exciting, well-told story about an incident in the Civil War.  James Andrews is a Union spy who shows his loyalty to the South by working as a blockade runner.  Andrews is asked by a Union general upon reporting to undertake a dangerous mission.  With a small group of men, get behind Confederate lines, steal a locomotive and race back to safety, tearing up track and burning bridges all the way so Confederate reinforcements can't get up to the lines for an upcoming attack.  But with Confederates right on their tail, can they make it back?  This was a short movie, about 85 minutes, but after the first 20-25 minutes, it's one extended chase scene which is exciting all the way until the end. Be forewarned if little kids are watching, this isn't your typical happy ending.  The movie benefits from the locations in Georgia and North Carolina, it looks like the same areas seen in the DC movies, and the train footage is excellent.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase!

  Less than a year since wrapping up the five-part Davy Crockett shows on Disneyland, Fess Parker plays James Andrews, the leader of a small group of raiders trying to complete their dangerous mission behind enemy lines.  Think of a more formal Davy Crockett for the character.  Jeffrey Hunter is very good as William Fuller, the train conductor in hot pursuit of the raiders as they race toward safety.  John Lupton is good as William Pittenger, the most visible of Andrews' raiders who becomes almost a second-in-command.  Fans of Disney movies will appreciate the supporting cast that includes Jeff York, Kenneth Tobey, and Don Megowan. I kept waiting for Buddy Ebsen (Georgie Russel) to show up!  The rest of the cast includes Harry Carey JR, Claude Jarman, Eddie Firestone, Slim Pickens, and even Dick Sargent of Bewitched fame in a small part.  All around, a really good cast.

 The DVD has a very cleaned up widescreen presentation that looks great, especially with the filming locations.

On April 12, 1862, a group of Yankees headed by Andrews, a smooth talker and prevaricator claimed they were on the Southern side.  He is the star spy, played by Fess Parker who does all the talking, a popular guy heading the Secret Service for the Northern side.  The other ""star"" was played by Jeffrey Hunter, my J.C. with those blue eyes in 'King of Kings', not so prevalent with his Southern accent.  He is the railroad conducter who follows the heisters.  John Owens was a young Mark in his glasses; he played Ross (""one was pointing toward us; they all look mighty suspicious."").

They trick the train crew into leaving them outside with the train, The General, which they take over to use to burn bridges along the East/West from Memphis to Huntsville, Alabama line.  Knoxville is barely able to defend East Tennessee, Campbell is south of Nashville.  They hide in the car #1651 as they navigate toward the Cumberland Mountains in desolute country.  The Tennessee River is impassable (that was before TVA dams were built to alleviate this constant deterrent).  They dined with a group of Southern sympathizers where they sang ""Dixie"" and other regional songs and gave the Rebel yell.  It was a close call as they took over the General; three engines came after them, led by Fuller the conductor.  Engineers don't talk much; all they do is follow orders.

It was a game of keep away.  Andrews claimed  he was taking ammunition to Chattanooga.  ""Who do you think you are, own the whole railroad?""  At the Johnny Reb campground, someone wondered aloud, ""Won't anything stop that train?""  They were to be ambushed in a tunnel with a whistle announcing their arrival.  They were surrounded by S. Calvary who were on the warpath.  The spies were caught and put in prison.  ""We've all got to go sometime.""

Made in an innocent time, where events played out as they happened, when political correctness wasn't even heard of, and our heros taught by example.",1189728000,,731,4.848
852637,5,6304368801,"I just watched this movie for the first time in probably 15 or 20 years. Although I am far too young to have seen this in its initial release in theatres, this was one of the very first movies that I saw when I was a child. I really did not remember much from the movie--except that it had given me thrills as a kid. I was excited to watch this again with my brother and father.

My father is a Noth Carolina native who moved up north, and that makes me a North Dakota native. This is important because we both tend to lean on opposite sides of the ""Civil War fence."" Well, this movie is great because it shows respect to both sides. The main premise is that some Northern spies steal a train from the South with the intentions of destroying tracks and bridges. One determined Southern railroad conductor takes personal offense at his train being stolen and follows it doggedly--first on foot and slowly upgrading from there.

You can't really describe the movie beyond the premise without ruining it. However, this is based on a true story--and one that potentially would have impacted the war in a BIG way. This is given colorful Disney treatment, and it is very enjoyable. As mentioned already, you are able to watch this from either perspective and enjoy it because both sides are given equal treatment. Also, it is not just the story of a locomotive chase as it also outlines the beginning of the Medal of Honor.

As for the DVD release, I don't mind that there are not extras. The picture is good, and the movie is what I bought it for--not the extras!  Thanks for an excellent film on DVD!",1167609600,5,1596,4.436860068259386

ride on a train pulled by the ""General."" This was back during the Civil War Centennial celebration and believe me, nothing

today's graphic violence and gore.  In the tradition of Disney

852639,4,6304368801,"The movie is outstanding. Fess Parker and the rest turn in excellent performances. This exciting story is based on the true to life incident that took place during the Civil War. From what I have heard there were only a couple minor changes in the recreation of the story. Walt Disney made wonderful movies during the Fifties and Sixties that were great for the whole family to enjoy together. I am ecstatic they are now releasing these movies to DVD. My only complaint is that there seems to be an issue with quantity instead of quality. They seem more interested in releasing a great number of movies than worrying about the condition of them. Now I'm am as anxious as the next person to get all their live action movies out but I hope they start taking the time to realize they need to monitor the quality control. I don't need the extras on this first release. Once they have released all the movies they use to run on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" then they can go back and do Platinum Editions. I will be satisfied with just the movie since there are so many more they need to release like ""Dr. Syn, alias Scarecrow"" and ""The Swamp Fox"" that I can be satisfied with just the basics but I want the movie to have sharp picture and sound quality. Some of the recent live action movies have been great quality (e.g. Three Lives of Thomasina) and some have been poor (e.g. ""The Journey of Natty Gann). I hope someone from Disney is paying attention to Amazons reviews because if they don't they may find their DVDs aren't selling so well. Fortunately this DVD picture and sound quality are nicely restored. There are no extra features.",1114041600,39,1638,4.518518518518518
852640,1,6304368801,"After two previous releases by Anchor Bay, one would assume this release by the movie producer, Disney, would be the ultimate issue of this film. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Besides having zero....none, nyet....bonus features....not even a trailer, this release is riddled with problems. While the menu and FBI warnings are anamorphic, the movie itself is not. If the transfer had been halfway decent, this would be somewhat forgiveable. However, the transfer is grainy, the color pulses, and edge enhancement is frequent throughout. Certain portions of the movie even appear to be in the wrong ratio....as if the screen were squeezed top to bottom.
Another problem I encountered....and basically the last straw....was the random appearance of foreign subtitles as I watched the movie. Whether this is a problem with all DVD players, I do not know [mine is a Toshiba]....but on a quality product, this should never be a problem on any player.
While the movie is somewhat enjoyable [typical 50's Disney-style drama], I'd avoid this DVD [wish I HAD] based purely on the lack of effort Disney put out in assembling it.
Figures....Disney finally releases some of its movies in their entirety [not the destructive pan & scan], and they still put out a lousy DVD.",1086307200,45,1270,5.08133971291866
852641,4,6304368801,"It's been many years since I had seen ""The Great Locomotive Chase"", and it was a real pleasure to watch it again. With so many other reviews, I don't think I need to summarize the plot.

Anchor Bay, as usual, has given us a DVD that is beautiful to look at, with only a few areas where the age of the film is apparent. This is widescreen and I can't imagine watching this film any other way. The sound is pretty much what you would expect for a 1956 release.

Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter are fine as the lead protagonists, with Jeff York also registering as one of Andrews' Raiders who would rather fight, than follow the ""cloak and dagger"" routine. Of course, York played Mike Fink--""King of the River""--opposite Fess Parker's Davy Crockett.

This movie is a dream for railroad buffs--old steam trains still provide a thrill for many people. It is also noteworthy for  people interested in the civil war, being based on actual events, although I suspect history scholars might find it too superficial. However, the purpose of this movie is to entertain fans of all ages--not to get bogged down in too much detail.

Parents should find this movie a delight to watch with their children, especially young boys. The plot is not complicated--there is plenty of action--and while shots are fired, and some fists fly, there is none of the more graphic violence that today's films seem to wallow in.

Like other reviewers, I would have liked some ""extras"". Comments from Fess Parker--now a successful California wine-maker--added a lot to Disney's Davy Crockett collection. Mr. Parker's memories of this film would have been a nice plus. Sadly, Jeffrey Hunter passed away at a young age, during the 1960s.
Perhaps some day there will be a ""deluxe"" edition from Disney--but, in the mean time, we must thank Anchor Bay for giving us this highly watchable version.

Again, recommended viewing for the whole family.

A very sad footnote, dated 20 March 2010. Mr. Fess Parker has passed away. I recall as a small boy in England seeing Davy Crockett, and being mesmerized by this tall, ""straight-talkin' straight-shootin'"" American, who was indisputably the ""King of the Wild Frontier"" ! Like millions of kids all over the world, I was soon running around with a coonskin cap, singing the Davy Crockett song. Thank you for the magical memories, Mr. Parker--God rest your soul.",1054857600,78,2367,4.827160493827161

' must have ' for me for my railway film collection.
An interesting point about this DVD is that as the 'Extra Features'offered to us are that of, on one side of the disc the film is in Widescreen (2.35:1 ratio)whilst on the other side its a Full frame presentation.

852644,4,6304368801,"Walt Disney loved trains.  He took the ""Andrews Raiders"" incident from the Civil War (that involved Union spies hijacking a Confederate train) and turned it into a movie.  It has it's inaccuracies, but overall it gives you an idea of what really happened.  What really makes this movie is that Disney contacted the B&O train museum in Baltimore, and borrowed some of their period locomotives and equipment.  Portraying the hijacked locomotive ""The General"" is the ""William Mason"" from the museum.  She's a fine lady of a locomotive, who appeared not only in this movie, but the recent flop ""The Wild Wild West"" as ""the Wanderer"". Fess Parker gives his usual wooden and stilted performance as Andrews, and being a Disney film there's singing (but no dancing) in the movie.  But Jeffrey Hunter does a great job as Fuller, the Confederate conductor of the hijacked train.  Most men would have been alarmed as they watched their train pull away without the regular crew, but how many would run after it like Fuller did? And run and run, commandeering a rail car and 3 locomotives before finally catching up with the stolen train.  Hunter captures the determination of this man who is the single reason the plan of the Andrews Raiders failed.",1018828800,,1237,4.857142857142857

It follows the story of one of the characters who participated in the event.  I've heard that the actual engines were used in the making of the film, as well as the actual railroad.  The acting is a little forced sometimes, and some of the guys seemed uncomfortable with their lines at times. I think this movie could stand a remake, for it is a good story.
