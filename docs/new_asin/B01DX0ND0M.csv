7725664,2,B01DX0ND0M,"I love chess movies. This one falls really flat. Unlike other chess movies involving children such as Searching for Bobby Fischer, Knights of the South Bronx, or even the documentary Chess Kids, this film doesn't draw you into the characters enough for you to care about them. Some of the acting and lines given to one of the young girls did not suit her age and she almost came off prostitute-like. You could tell when some moments should have been very emotional - they tried hard to be - but failed.  Some songs with lyrics playing softly in the background were very nice for those scenes, but there was often no music when it could have used it. This ""Family Approved"" movie also had the ""s"" word in it in one scene which could have easily been substituted with a more family-friendly word. I give it 2 stars not for the movie itself, but for the featurette which introduces you to the true events that inspired the movie and the folks behind the scenes, who, unfortunately, are more likable than the characters in the film. My recommendation: Pass on this one. Use your 90 minutes for a more enjoyable film like the ones I mentioned at the beginning. Definitely DON'T spend any money on this.",1467936000,,1197,4.567441860465117

Nor is the payoff all that. I definitely don't recommend buying this movie.  If you are looking for a lackluster feel good movie, this is it, but don't pay for it.",1503187200,,336,4.55

8757106,5,B01DX0ND0M,"Endgame is an interesting film with some good characters and memorable performances, but the plot could use a little work. Although, at the end of the movie, I had a smile on my face.

At a very young age, Jose (Rico Rodriguez) starts to learn chess from his Abuelita (Ivonne Coll) but he has always been in his brothers shadow. When tragedy strikes, Jose receives a calling to become a chess champion. The movie is inspired by the true story about a school in Texas that built an champion chess team.

My favorite character is Mr. Alvarado (Efren Ramirez) because he never gives up on the kids and even spends his rent money to get them to a tournament. Another character I like is Jose's grandmother because she is always giving him good advice, encouraging him to do the right thing and she teaches him to play chess. There are other performances that stand out for me. Rico Rodriguez puts a lot of effort into his role and he is very believable. So does newcomer Alina Hererra who plays Joses friend and is the person who gets him interested in playing chess for the school.

As much as I like the characters and the actors, the plot is uneven and I feel as if Ive seen parts of it in other films. Some scenes are pretty inspiring, but others just feel cheesy and stylized. When the plot tries to take an emotional turn, sometimes it ends up going flat and didn't resonate with me. I enjoyed the ending of this movie anyway because it is a pleasant surprise.

Compared to films about baseball or football, chess doesn't get much attention in the film industry, so it is nice to see it recognized in this film. I am also surprised how deep the film delves into social issues. The ending also managed to surprise me in spite of the plot problems in how it was executed. I like some of the music in this film and it really signals the right tone in some scenes.

I recommend this film for ages 12 to 16 due to some language and some crude humor. I give it 2 out of 5 stars. It's not perfect but if you like Rico Rodriguez from the TV series Modern Family or chess, you'll probably enjoy Endgame.

8757107,5,B01DX0ND0M,Highly recommend. It does have a bit of rough language and is very 'real' in it's depiction of this family. I watched it with my chess-tourney playing just turned 9 yo daughter and she loved it.  For many kids particularly in this age it might be a bit too cerebral and slow moving. I think safe for 10+ for sure. Very good lessons -- done in a real way without being preachy or at the same time too risqu or rough. A great little gem -- fantastic acting!,1471564800,,455,4.170454545454546
