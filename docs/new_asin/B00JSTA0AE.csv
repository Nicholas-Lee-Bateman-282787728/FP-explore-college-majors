8653777,1,B00JSTA0AE,"The title is a little misleading.
This movie had little to do with ""PMS"".
It seems like this movie was quickly re-edited to try and be something else.

The description claims that she is seeking ""vengeance""... but she is just killing random people.
Was not worth the $2 that I paid.",1474502400,,282,4.529411764705882

8653780,1,B00JSTA0AE,"This movie is really not any good, but this bigger problem is that Amazon doesn't have the movie in its entirety. It ends abruptly partway in. Although it's pretty obvious what would have happened, I'm annoyed to have spent the money to rent the movie and not be able to see the whole thing.",1421020800,2,291,4.407407407407407
8653781,2,B00JSTA0AE,"The film opens rather campy as a fine looking young lady (Emali Kimker) steps out of the shower. She is accosted by a clown (Daniel Skinner) who makes cuffs from string balloons. The clown is taken out by our star, Officer Mary (Heather Hall) who apparently has a history of violence. She is recommend for a special program to control her PMS symptoms. The program doesn't work out and Mary (Cindy Means) goes Uma Thurman all over them in bloody, poorly choreographed violence. Unfortunately the film was so low budget that once they went into one building, they stayed there, limiting their ability to create good scenes.

Acting left much to be desired too.

That would be Big Momma's House. But it's still a alright flick. If you want violence, it's got violence. If you want tities, it's got tities. If you want a movie about two gay dudes gettin' it on, rent Brokeback Mountain.",1399680000,7,390,4.430555555555555
