In a time when humanity was displaying its capacity for the most chilling evil, the simple kindness and courage of the Danish people remind us of the good of which we are also capable. Highly recommended.",1341100800,,282,4.66
8187715,5,B000OYNWEI,The Danish resistance is a long overlooked story of ordinary heroism.  It makes you wonder whether you would be able to do it under the same circumstances -- and if you can't it's very possible we are all doomed.,1255651200,,212,4.435897435897436
8187716,5,B000OYNWEI,A glorious documentary about Danish Christians who sacrificed so much to help the Danish Jews from the Nazis. A heartening account of one of history's greatest rescues. As a Jew I was deeply touched and I salute the Danish people for living their Christian faith. I can't recommend this film enough.,1183852800,11,299,4.882352941176471
8187717,5,B000OYNWEI,"The Danish rescue of the country's Jewish population during World War II is a tremendous story that is particularly moving against the backdrop of the Nazi slaughter of Jews and others in Europe at the time. There are many heroes in this story and this film introduces the viewer to many of them. A number of the actual rescuers and rescued are profiled here, and unlike other films on the topic, we learn that many of the rescuers ended up being leaders of Danish society after the war. I use this this film to teach undergraduate and graduate students and executives about moral courage and ethics. Sometimes we know what the right thing is, but doing it is another matter. This film is all about doing the right thing. This story has profound implications for all of us, including business people who are trying to develop an ethical culture within their organizations.",1168300800,,872,4.743421052631579
