7986829,5,B00008T2C0,"Never was there a movie that I loved so much when I was little! Whenever this movie came on television I would run around the house because I was so happy. This story follows very closely to the classic ballet of the same name and uses the haunting theme song from the ballet as its main theme. What I like about the story is that it is darker and more mysterious compared with a lot of children's movies today, but it is also more vividly beautiful. There are images from this movie that have stayed with me my entire life, they were so beautiful. A definite must-see for both children and adults!",1172102400,5,598,4.348214285714286
