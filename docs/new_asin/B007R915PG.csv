If you're studying to be an actor, each episode is an acting lesson by Karl and Mike. The DVD third season is terrific as usual, as are seasons 1 and 2... the color and sound is vibrant and brings back so many wonderful 40 year old memories.

5105175,5,B007R915PG,"The critics may never have considered this as one of the great television cop shows but to me it remains as one of my all time favorites.  Always loved the style of Quinn Martin productions and this one benefitted from the excellent casting of Karl Malden (an actor and man I have always admired) and Michael Douglas but  most of all, the streets and city of San Francisco.  The shows in retrospect were probably fairly routine but with the wonderful chemistry between Malden and Douglas and the endless fascinating sights of the city by the bay, this series could hardly fail.  This second half of season three incorporates eleven episodes from 1974-1975 and among the many fine guest stars are Robert Webber, Sam Jaffe, Luther Adler, John Kerr, Peter Strauss, William Windom, Darleen Carr (reprising as Malden's daughter), Dean Stockwell, Peter Haskell, Robert Walker, James Olson, Julie Adams, Michael Strong and Tony LoBianco.  These episodes made some forty years hold up exceptionally well and are still great viewing.",1412812800,5,1024,5.071428571428571

5105183,5,B007R915PG,"The Streets of San Francisco was and still is one of my favorite cop shows of all time. This was about real police work and about the relationship between two cops of different generations and how well they worked together. Micheal Douglas, son of the great actor Kirk Douglas shows that he has his own star power and knows how to handle it. Karl Malden, one of the great ones, juggles well the roles of superior commander, big brother and at times even father figure in the relationship of Steeve Keller and Mike Stone. It is television at it's finest and the actors, from guest stars to special guest stars and even the extras were of the finest quality.
For those of us who remember it it's a must have. For those who come after, give it a chance and watch television portray reality, before the time of special effects and the unbelievable survivals of exaggerated car explosions. Come to the time when actors were able to make you believe that these people existed and that the story you are seeing is true, even if it wasn't.
One of my old teachers told the class once that an actor has to be able to make you believe that you are watching a true event unfolding before your eyes. That the person you are watching really does exist. Well, that is exactly what Quinn Martin Productions brought to the television screen. And the actors of that time were able to pull it off beautifully!",1371772800,5,1390,4.4980237154150196
5105184,5,B007R915PG,The 70's gave us alot of fine acting and great police stories.  The plots back them centered on the crimes and how they were solved.  Very little of the characters personal lives involvement (bedroom scenes). Still love those kind of shows!  Great acting as well!,1367280000,,263,4.8
5105185,5,B007R915PG,"Still loving this show.  Wish they would have made many more shows, but I guess they can't go on forever.  I can always find what I am looking for on Amazon",1362528000,,156,4.0
5105195,5,B007R915PG,"I always enjoyed this show when it was on and bought this particular DVD set because my favorite actor, Dean Stockwell was a guest star.",1361836800,,136,4.48
5105196,3,B007R915PG,"As a great fan of ""Streets of San Francisco"" when it aired, I was surprised to see that this third season of the series seems to lag a bit from the standard set by the first two.  Malden and Douglas are still excellent, but the scripts are less interesting (one even includes an entirely unrelated subplot which is never resolved ... one has the feeling the director just needed filler).  Since one of the great pleasures of the series (for this former San Francisco resident) is its use of locations around the City, it was disappointing that this season makes far less creative use of those locations -- one episode even takes place almost entirely in another county.  I also became more aware, from the perspective of today's ""procedurals,"" of how simplistic the treatment of police work is.  And the production values, which were state of the art when the series aired, now seem fairly primitive.  But if you love being taken back to that time, and if you've ""left your heart in San Francisco"" as I have, this is still a good ride.",1361059200,4,1035,4.603260869565218
5105197,4,B007R915PG,I have all seasons  and enjoy all of them. I enjoy the writing (most) and seeing SanFrancisco with Michael Douglas as a young man and Carl Malden in his prime. There are many great co-stars too.,1358467200,,194,4.388888888888889
5105198,5,B007R915PG,Was a favorite of ours years ago. What a joy to watch it again. you feel you know the characters and hate to see the series end,1358035200,,127,3.740740740740741
5105199,5,B007R915PG,"I own  season 1 to 4 never get tired of it the pilot in season 1 is not so good .

8521273,5,B007R915PG,"""The Streets of San Francisco"" was an underrated police drama of the Seventies, and this DVD set contains the final eleven episodes of Season Three that were originally broadcast on ABC from December 1974 to March 1975.  Detectives Mike Stone and Steve Keller solve murders in this series that has an extremely strong sense of setting.  ""Streets"" was filmed on location in San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area, and the viewer sees not just the tourist areas, but also sees the more gritty sections of the city as they appeared in the mid-Seventiesthe team even goes to Alcatraz one episode this season.  While there are no instantly recognizable guest stars in these episodes, the writing is still superb and has not fallen off, and if you have watched earlier seasons of this series, you will enjoy these episodes as well.",1517443200,,829,4.865248226950355
