8278548,2,B0002AAGNE,"This is a faded document indeed. Natalya Makarova is not the main star, but just one of the fairies. The document is interesting to those who are interested in Soviet dance history. Yury Soloviev, who dances the role of Prince Desire, was the most promising young star of Soviet ballet it the early sixties, far more popular than Rudolf Nureyev, his colleague at the Kirov. When Nureyev defected to the West, they were both sharing the same room in Paris during the Kirov's French tour. Alla Sisova, who dances Princess Aurora, was Nureyev's regular partner in Leningrad. And Natalya Dudinskaya was the first famous Russian dancer to partner Nureyev (they were quite a match in ""Laurencia"").

As for the video, the sound is second-class and the colors are faded. The video lasts only about 90 minutes, and there are several cuts. Sets and costumes are banal, although the dancing is exquisite.

A better option would be the Bolshoi's version with Nina Semizorova and Alexey Fadeyeshev or, better still, the Royal Ballet's version, with Viviana Durante and Zoltan Solymozy.",1100217600,6,1072,5.01685393258427
