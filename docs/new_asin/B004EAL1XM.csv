8426603,5,B004EAL1XM,Great metal DVD. I do like Grave Digger but I do not buy everything they put out. That being said I love this DVD. With backing vocals from Van Canto and several guest appearances including Hansi Kursch from Blind Guardian you can't go wrong with this. Amazing musicianship and incredible songs. If you like watching metal concerts on DVD this is one of my favorites and I know you will love it. Superb sound and picture quality. AWESOME! MELODIC!
