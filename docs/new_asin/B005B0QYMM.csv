4642921,5,B005B0QYMM,"This movie was really good.  I am a horror fan who does not care for general slash and gore movies, it has to have some substance to it.  This fit the bill for spooky.  The sound track and quality was good, along with the acting.  The ""Ghost Investigators"" bear a striking resemblence to a ""Ghost Investigation"" team which is currently airing on PBS.  So, there was some tongue and cheek humor in it, and I found that amusing.  But, for the most part it is a horror movie based on the supernatural and was really scary at times, more so than any other documentary style horror movie that I've seen.  If you have small children please be advised that this movie will give them nighmares!",1315094400,31,686,4.44
4642922,5,B005B0QYMM,I love ghosthunters and shows like that. If you do you'll like this too. Give it a try. It'll give you a few good scares.,1315094400,6,121,3.88
4642923,5,B005B0QYMM,"this is by far the best movie i have seen this year. This movie was scarier than Insidious. This movie is ranked up with paranormal activity and blair witch. If you like the mtv show fear your going to love this movie and even if you never watch it, its still a really scary movie. check it out i thought it was very well done.",1314662400,6,327,4.046153846153846
4642924,3,B005B0QYMM,"Grave Encounters could have been a great horror film. That being said it's not really all that bad, but I expected more. First you will see a standard Blair Witch ""this footage was found"" speech that segues into a rip-off of Ghost Adventures right down to the taped Xs. Fortunately the lead character is not quite up to Zak Bagans' superhero level of douchebaggery, yet.  From there you will find yourself watching a decent ghost flick until they throw some creatures into the mix. I assume the creatures are some variety of face distorting demon. If you have seen 2005's Constantine you know what I'm talking about. You will also be introduced to a lobotomist that will supply the ""plot twist"" at the end. If you have seen 2001's Session 9 you have seen the twist. As a matter of fact if you have seen Ghost Adventures, Session 9, and the Korean ghost girl in car video on YouTube you have seen the whole freaking movie. For a lot less than six dollars. I must say I admire the Vicious Brother's total disregard for potential copyright infringement litigation. At multiple points in film you will find yourself thinking ""These guys either have the world's greatest attorney or really large gonads.""",1314662400,4,1199,4.70952380952381
4642925,1,B005B0QYMM,"After seeing the trailer I thought this movie would be a half decent one, sadly I was wrong. Everyone else who reviewed this movie as a positive experience may not entirely know what they're talking about. I am an absolute horror movie lover and this one, even from the get-go, I simply could NOT take seriously. The events of the movie weren't half bad, seeing as they tried to get creative somewhat with were the movie was going to go. It's decent on a level, so long as you don't have ANYTHING else to watch, you might as well give it a shot. Overall it wasn't the most horrible movie I've ever seen but nothing I would recommend to anyone. The effects of the movie itself could be seen on every other movie like it, and the fact that they were basically mimicking Zak Bagans from Ghost Adventures just made it absolutely unbelievable. At least those guys have some credibility and make an entertaining show.

Honestly, it was not worth the $5.99 I spent to rent it. I would hope you'd heed the warning, but if it's really bothering you to see it...go for it I guess!",1314489600,13,1070,4.431472081218274

NOTE: Amazon has the Blu-Ray that's labelled as being released on May 22, 2012 listed as being Region 2/B, which would result in most BR players here in America not being able to play it. THIS INFORMATION IS WRONG. This version is REGION-FREE. It says it on the back of the package, the disc itself AND I tried it on my multi-region BR player with the settings on Region 1, Region 2 and Region 3. It worked for all them.

4642937,3,B005B0QYMM,"We had already saw the second movie first,this movie filled a couple blanks for us.
It's like a documentary type film,inside a very haunted closed down insane asylum. Several young filmakers agree to be locked inside,for one night.
It is crazy scary,in a edge of the seat way,and is not for the timid. Impossibly insane things happen,and stuff you don't expect. It messes with your mind. The ghosts are angry,and vicious. The young people are innocent and clueless as to what's coming. They think they know,oh no,not even close. By the time they realize their dire mistake,it is far too late.
The ending is a trip. You find out what happened to everyone,and it ain't any too pretty. Very shocking.
It's a wild ride. Buckle up.",1502668800,,726,4.76984126984127
4642938,4,B005B0QYMM,"I'm not a big fan of found footage horror, but I liked this one a lot. Yes, it was creepy at times, but it was also a little funny, and the fact that the lead was doing a terrific impression of Zak Bagans kept me watching. (If you've ever seen Ghost Adventures, you'll probably get a kick out of the similarities. I did, enough to draw me through the film.)

It's a little campy sometimes, with a decent creepy factor. There's really not much new here, though I appreciate there's actually a good reason for cameras to capture everything. One of the more enjoyable FF movies I've seen.",1502064000,,585,4.416666666666667

I watch alll the ghost shows and by far this one is one of my faves that I want to watch again and again cause it always scares the crap out of me!!",1498176000,,354,3.5974025974025974
4642942,5,B005B0QYMM,"Grave Encounters is probably one of my favorite movies ever. It teaches us the lesson that we should never mess with anything we don't understand. Most folks who watch this probably won't know they're watching an actual movie and rather an actual documentary. I think because of that it makes it an awesome movie. Do yourself a favor and buy it, don't rent it because that's dumb.",1498003200,,380,4.686567164179104
4642943,3,B005B0QYMM,"for the first hour, then when the sarcasm ends and the scares begin, this whole movie seems unconvincing, overdone and forced. Surprisingly well- produced for a low-budget film, but to little effect. Disappointing, and the late scene with the rat, completely unnecessary! Better luck next time; 100 Ghost Street ('12) is a superior endeavor.",1495411200,,341,5.333333333333333
4642944,3,B005B0QYMM,"Had a lot of potential, decent acting (albeit a bit over-the-top at times with the yelling), fair amount of tension and creep factor. Well-shot too, I guess. But, the jumpscares all throughout the movie are just annoying. Every single time it gets quiet you can pretty much expect something to jump out and scream with some loud noise behind it and all it does is undo the tension and take you out of the experience, in my opinion. If they had focused more on building tension this could've been a pretty solid horror flick.",1494547200,,524,4.585106382978723
4642945,5,B005B0QYMM,"This was a gift of purchase for my daughter's 16th birthday and she has been raving about this movie for a long time. so when she got her first question was ""can we watch it?""

4642946,2,B005B0QYMM,"I seemed promising at first, but got more and more goofy as the movie went on. It seemed like they were biting off of Blaire Witch Project, with the lines being said, the handheld approach, one person getting lost and the others go looking for him.

Grave Encounters 1 and 2 are the best found footage films I have ever watched, and I've watched a lot of them. I've even watched this one more than once and still find it scary.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. It plays upon nightmares that I'm sure you've had before. If you love found footage like I do, you're going to love Grave Encounters. Even the sequel is worth watching. Grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy!",1494028800,,521,4.21

Not that scary.",1491264000,,264,4.595744680851064
4642951,5,B005B0QYMM,What begins as a rather innocent documentary of an abandoned insane asylum (for a tv show with more than a hint of embellishment and skepticism) deteriorates into madness and fear. The first third of the movie is deceptive as to how good this film really is. Nightmarish ending. Definitely not for children.,1491177600,5,307,4.923076923076923

4642955,3,B005B0QYMM,"Maybe it was all the good reviews giving me high expectations--it's rare for a found footage horror movie to have anything above a 3 star average on this site--but I was very underwhelmed by this movie. The two things that make a good found footage movie are the scares and the mystery; whether that mystery is about who's going to live or about what's going on isn't really important. This movie had neither. Less than 40 minutes in and you could easily tell how the rest of the movie was going to go. There was no tension, because the hospital was too powerful. Every time they tried to escape, a new corridor sprang up out of nowhere right behind the exit, or a wall blocked their way out, or they got lost, etc. There was no way any of them were going to survive. Which is where the mystery usually comes in. Except, there really isn't any mystery in this. It's a haunted mental hospital where a doctor experimented on his patients and got killed by his patients. All of the ""spirits"" they set up in the beginning--the girl who killed herself in the bath, the bald man who appeared to two teenagers, the ghost who pushed a man off a ladder, the ghost who opens the locked window--none of them are anything more than a manifestation of the hospital, which in itself has absolutely no personality or motivation. Why are they trapped? Why is the hospital driving some of them insane and just killing the others? There's really no point to anything that's going on, and it really makes the movie drag, especially the fourth time they think of an escape plan, only to have the hospital turn it into another dead end. Maybe it could have worked better if it was written as more of a character driven story of a haunted hospital slowly driving people insane, but out of the two people who do go crazy, what drives them crazy mostly happens off camera. They're normal, if scared and desperate, one minute and the next they're mumbling to themselves or laughing or eating rats or saying nonsense. And the characters, while not terribly written, just never clicked with me. We saw that one of them had a family, but other than one time where he was walking through the hospital angrily complaining about he wanted to ""see his girl"", he never brought it up. When things were at their worst, he was busy either yelling at people or sitting silently; he never once seemed like he cared that he might never see his wife and daughter again. In fact, the most connection anyone had to the outside world once it became obvious that they were trapped in a supernatural hospital and couldn't leave was the lead guy justifying his filming by saying ""people are gonna wanna see this"". Their reactions were just unrealistic enough to keep me from caring at all about their fate.

The scares were pretty lame too. A few times they set up some really creepy moments, but they were almost always ruined by an unnecessary, Paranormal Activity-esque music sting (you know the one, where the bass slowly gets really loud to show that something scary is gonna happen, but in PA it was a slow build and it never reached a crescendo, in this, it happened very quickly and you know the exact second something ""scary"" was going to happen because the sting always reached its loudest point when it did) or a really crappy ""digital distortion"" effect--which is the easiest way to kill a movie for me, because most of them are so completely fake and nothing like what real digital distortion looks like. There was really only one genuinely scary moment for me, and that was when the lead guy encounters a ""patient"" clinging to the ceiling and then runs away with the camera occasionally flashing behind him. It worked because you actually felt like he was in danger, and the quick bits of the dark corridor you saw behind him could have had something in them, but the camera was too shaky to see. And that's a big problem with this movie, because, despite what's going on, you never really feel like any of the supernatural things the characters encounter are actually a threat to them. They're mostly there to scare the viewer, and the characters are only there because we, the audience, wouldn't get to see the scary things otherwise. The best thing found footage has going for it is the ability to make the viewer feel like they're really there (the still cameras set up in the spooky hallways and dark tunnels were great for this, because you're looking for something scary in the distance, but almost nothing happens in these locations) but this movie seems to do everything it can to drag the viewer out of the experience. And while I'm talking about the still cameras, two of the worst moments in the movie happen because of them. One character is separated from the main group and doesn't have a camera, and the only way we can see him is because of the previously set up still cameras, but his actual death occurs on a camera that was never set up. We saw the four cameras being set in the beginning, and instead of killing him in the creepy corridor they took time establishing as a hotspot of ghostly activity, suddenly there a fifth camera in this brand new corridor we've never seen before; very lazy. The second is when, after traveling for over a day in an endless corridor, the lead guy is actually shown on one of the cameras they set up in the beginning, but even though he's standing right in front of it with a flashlight, he never once sees it or acknowledges it as a sign that he's finally in a familiar place.

Anyway. It wasn't a bad movie. I've certainly seen worse. But it wasn't a good found footage movie either. Too many bad digital distortion effects and obviously CGI ghosts/monsters, and not enough story, good characterization, tension, or scares.",1486598400,,5748,4.585034013605442

Even the ""jump"" scares were ""blah"" and there are plenty of those. I have seen many a horror movie in my day and this is one of the worst ones yet.

4642981,5,B005B0QYMM,"The movie is based on the West Lawn Riverview Hospital located in Canada and is based on the urban legends of the building its self some people are too scared to go in at night. The building its self seems amazing in person rather than watching the movie just do not visit it at night time or lock your self in it like Grave Encounters did. The demons them self seem very strong based on the movie and the stretchy creepy black magic stunt amazes me more than scares me. The idea of the building is people fear something based on looks and not intelligence the first one is always good but the second made it look like a joke at the beginning but it gets good in the middle.

If you're a person who's into scares like this then this is the right movie for you and you should check them both out BEWARE the beginning of Grave Encounters 2 starts out at a stupid halloween drug party. Hopefully Grave Encounters 3 will make up for that kind of situation and there will be a good amount of scares.

4642989,5,B005B0QYMM,"Loved it.  I found it on Netflix and wasn't really expecting much, and the first thirty minutes seem like kind of a typical mock paranormal investigator show with a bunch of suspense and minor creepiness, but then it gets really intense really quickly.  It ended up being kind of unique, pretty engrossing, and quite terrifying.  There's a sense of hopelessness after a while that really gets to you.  I ended up liking it so much that I watched it multiple times and then bought a copy when they removed it from Netflix.  Check out the sequel, too; it's about film students who watch this movie and figure out that it's real.  Not quite as good, really strange ending, but still worth watching and amusingly meta.",1460160000,,714,4.672
4642990,5,B005B0QYMM,"This was a fun movie ala Ghost Adventures. Not so much gruesome but pretty mental. Grave Encounters is like combining a fictional paranormal reality show and a Halloween Haunted House. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies due to the genre's insistence in using gratuitous violence, fake screams and buckets of blood but this movie was very well done. As other reviewers have said, if you like paranormal TV shows, you'll appreciate this one. P.S.  if you are an animal lover, there is a scene near the end which will upset you terribly. Do what I did and fast forward through it.",1460073600,,578,4.611650485436893

4643090,2,B005B0QYMM,"To put this film into context, I would say that it was made and handled with care. The acting was adequate though I must admit, the characters were not interesting in the least. The movie did translate well as an authentic found footage film in that it didn't have any shots that appeared to be done with a HD Studio Cam or from angles that would not be in a found footage video. The plot was good enough, though again it was very slow and dull to watch, which would be fine if the tension were to build up and if the ending managed to pay off. One thing that didn't destroy that film but made it dull to experience was the over use of computer animated effects. I liked the grain filter that the applied to the effects so that the fact that it was CGI did not stand out as much, but you still knew it was CGI which is never as creepy let alone interesting as practical effects.

Have said all that, for a found footage film that I presume was shot on a very low budget, it was not a complete train wreck, but as a 40 year old horror veteran who began watching hard core horror at five, I have to say that this film offered absolutely nothing new...
...though if I were five, I'm sure that my opinion would differ. So I guess if you are young, or enjoy stuff like Paranormal Activity, or those low budget ghost hunter shows on TV, then I guess this is for you.",1446422400,,1360,4.132075471698113

Maybe the actors , from taking their own personalities with a "" reality and behind the scenes"" point of view along with showing them actually experiencing some REAL paranormal activity, for their first time in their careers may have added more fear, insecurity and loss of control.

4643176,5,B005B0QYMM,"A friend introduced me to this movie about 2 years ago and I have to say that I think this movie is very underrated. Is the acting spectacular? No. Original idea? Not entirely but its not just your typical ""Family moves into an abandoned house and then things start happening"" which makes this movie very refreshing in the ghost/haunting/horror genre. In the movie this show called ""Graven Encounters"", kind of like ghost adventures or ghost hunters, go into this house that was formerly a mental institution and they interview people who have been there or worked there on the building, basically the same type of format you would get from a standard ghost-hunting show. Then they get locked in for the night. Now obviously this ghost-hunting team does not take this seriously and are just in it for show and money so when they first start looking for signs of activity they don't get any and eventually just give up and don't take it seriously anymore but then afterwards things start happening and then they discover that, for whatever reason, they can't escape the building.
I felt that this movie was disturbing and frightening and it legitimately had me scared at some points and after having grown bored with these types of movies such as the later paranormal activity movies and the Conjuring I found this one to be quite refreshing and good like I said before.

The ghost of humanity decides to finish them off. The unfortunate part is, the ghost does not have much of a directional sense either but after living in a hallway for most of it's undead life, it must of learned how to go strait without getting lost as easily. Although, it still took 1 and half hours for the ghost to find it's way to all of those people.

The acting was OK, not great, but I certainly have seen a LOT worse and the plot is well, there is no real plot except they are on a hunt for paranormal events. I will just say if you have a couple of hours to kill then by all means do not shelve this and say maybe later.

4643296,4,B005B0QYMM,"The whole thing kept me on edge wondering what to expect. When the deep rumbling sounds took over the shot you knew something was about to happen and then bam. I had more moments were I actually jumped while watching this film than I have had in any other ghost story in a long while. The actual acting flips back and forth on credibility but for the most part the characters were played with truth and believability. They gave completely to the emotion of the story and made you feel their terror. For me that says a lot about a film. If you relate and belief that actor is the part then you believe the story. This film does that for me.

The special effects where top notch. From the hair being pulled away to the evil spirits clinging to the wall were killer. The entity presence visible shots were really intense and dark. Great attention to the special effects were taken serious in this film. The whole story leading from the point of entering the building down the spiral to insanity and into the bowls of psychiatric hell was fluid and cohesive completely. I found no real wholes in the story or the back story. This is truly a much better paranormal film compared to several others that fought for recognition lately. I totally intend to add this to my collection and enjoy it over and over.",1431216000,,1301,4.466386554621849

4643305,4,B005B0QYMM,"I went into this film with low expectations despite some of the good ratings, but was pleasantly surprised.  The film does start a little slow, but makes great fun of phony paranormal shows, mainly Ghost Adventures and Paranormal (the opening scene of the ""show"" is almost a dead on spoof of the opening of Ghost Adventures, and there's even one scene where the lead investigator bribes a groundskeeper $20 to make up a phony ghost sighting).  About 30 minutes in, the film starts ramping things up, and there are plenty of genuine scares and some good creepy atmosphere.  Unlike alot of films in the ""found footage"" genre, you actually start to bond with the characters a little; they're genuinely trapped in the old hospital, and don't do a lot of the ""let's split up"" stupid things that people in horror movies always seem to do. This film is definitely worth checking out for a good scare and a good laugh.",1430006400,,910,4.675

4643310,4,B005B0QYMM,"I'm not going to go over the plot because others have done so -- it is a movie about paranormal investigators and what happens when they find the what they hadn't planned on.  This was streaming on Netflix and I thought I could watch this while playing games on my iPad, just a little distraction. I love horror movies and my tastes are very low brow so I thought it was just thing.

This is what is good to great.

1) The acting.  I don't know any of these actors but they all inhabit their roles with verve and dedication.  It is the unexpectedly good acting that drew me into this film.  In a genre/sub-genre where talking over each other and screams are considered acting, these actors took their craft seriously but appropriately.  A stand out to me was the actor Mackenzie Gray as Houston Gray.  His slow disintegration from mask to man underneath was outstanding.

2) The pacing.  There is criticism that the stage-setting part of the film is slow ... maybe.  What I thought was it was a lulling preamble that contrasted well when the real scares started.  After that, you couldn't quite settle down because the pace was relentless.  Just the way good horror ought to be.

3) The filming.  I dislike found-footage film.  For one thing, I'm like ""Seriously, dude?  You would not be filming this at this point.  You'd be running for your life.""  For another, I think it is a really lazy way to make a movie.  This movie used the handheld and positioned cameras in a believable way that drove the plot but didn't feel so artificial.

The not-so-good.

1) The cinematography.  I think the muddiness and occasional graininess is stock for found-footage but I've seen films that can still make that work well for them.  There were places it added to scares, for sure, but there was too many places where it distracted and confused.

2) The writing.  The writing was so-so.  Some of the lines the actors had to speak/improvise made me roll my eyes.",1428105600,,1948,4.587209302325581

4643328,5,B005B0QYMM,"I wasn't really expecting much from this movie, however I can honestly say that for a free prime movie, it was exceptional. I enjoyed every minute of it, though the beginning made all of the characters relatively unlikeable for me - towards the end though I started becoming sorry for them and the torment they were going through.
Its the type of movie like Paranormal Activity where its events being filmed by the people inside the movie, only this one didn't suck. I found myself thoroughly entertained and even had some laughs in during the beginning parts (from some of the stupid things the characters would say, mainly TC). The only fault I would find with it is how stupid and inexperienced these 'ghost hunters' are, I mean really - let's lock ourselves in? Idiotic. Barely any back up either, there were like four or five of them. At least have more people and back up with you if you're going to be exploring a place that massive, and don't treat it as a joke; though I suppose this is the whole charm of the movie and I suppose you cannot blame them completely. From what the man in the beginning had said...they were some of the first people to do this kind of thing.

Well anyway, I decided to give it 5 stars because I enjoyed every part of it and it all built up very nicely. It would have been nice to get some closure on what exactly had happened to all of the characters however. You only really or kind of know what happened to Matt, the show's host, and Houston. Honestly however if I had to pay to rent this movie I would have had no regrets and would think it was money well spent. Way to go for it being part of prime though! Was it scary? Well not really, more creepy than anything. And there are some scenes toward the end that might make you jump - me personally I became wide-eyed from all of the ugliness I saw, now imagine seeing that stuff up close.

5 Stars and I would definitely watch again. Maybe in complete darkness and with some friends next time ;) I highly recommend to anyone who likes this kind of horror movie!",1426636800,4,2052,4.35509138381201

4643344,2,B005B0QYMM,"""Grave Encounters"" starts pretty strong, and if you happen to be a fan of Zak Bagans and his ""Ghost Adventures"" TV show, you will love the first 20 minutes or so of this movie as it's a spot-on parody. ""Grave Encounters"" begins losing steam about 30 minutes in and never really recovers.

""Grave Encounters"" is another found footage horror film, this time a ""reality"" TV crew is investigating an abandoned insane asylum, when their tapes are found and sent to their network. The footage is then presented as if this were an episode, the final episode, of the show. We soon learn that the host and crew are just in it to make a campy show, and don't really believe in ghosts or hauntings. They pay an actor to pretend he's a psychic, and a gardener to say that he's seen a ghost on the grounds, and the asylum handyman agrees to lock them in for the night, promising to return and unlock the doors in the morning. Once the crew gets locked in, strange things begin to happen, and they begin to hear voices and noises coming from the upper floors, and it seems like something in the asylum is not going to let them leave.

I really like the premise of ""Grave Encounters"", and enjoyed the performances in the film. Where the problem lies in the film is that it simply takes way too long to get to the creepy parts, and when they finally start with the scares, they are simply repetitive. They crew hears a strange noise or voice, go to investigate, something scares them and the run into a room. Deduct a crew member from each scene, and repeat, and repeat and repeat. By the 70 minute mark all horror is gone, and you just wish people would stop screaming and that the camera would settle down.",1424736000,3,1692,4.419871794871795

4643348,5,B005B0QYMM,"I would categorize this as an exceptional example of the found footage sub-genre of horror movies, just a short step down from the level of [REC]/Quarantine, resting comfortably on a level with such standouts as Apt. 143 and The Houses October Built. Like these films, the characters have a believable reason for wanting to film. In this case, it's because they're filming a reality show about haunted places, and the quality of the camerawork is quite credible for that scenario. The story is quite simple: a small film crew lock themselves in a derelict mental hospital with a troubling history, and then realize they're in for more than they bargain for. I know, that's the story in maybe half the found footage films that are out there, but originality doesn't matter that much when you pull it off so much better than the norm. The first few minutes establish our characters as a pretty unsavory crew: they're arrogant and obnoxious, disrespectful and so unscrupulous that they don't hesitate to bribe a gardener to make up a story about an encounter. And then, as they begin coming across signs of the paranormal they never believed they'd see, they enter a state of panic and despair so well depicted by the actors that all of a sudden you realize you are actually feeling sympathy for this ragtag band that you earlier thought were a bunch of douches. This is a great example of an Amazon Prime horror movie (as of 2.4.2015) that bucks the trend and makes you feel it would actually be worth slapping down some real money for!",1423094400,2,1534,4.727611940298507
4643349,4,B005B0QYMM,"I was not really expecting much from this movie at all. Mainly purchased this movie because some of the reviews on this site were interesting enough, so, what the heck (+ price was reasonable). Yep - I watch those ""cheesy"" ghost hunting reality shows on TV as well. Always thought that a movie depicting the events that happen in this movie would be a good idea for a story.

Not going into great depth here, but some of the events portrayed here probably really do happen in reality; example: the ghost hunting team arrives on site and, when interviewing ""witnesses"", they actually PAY someone to say that they have seen a ghost; the ghost hunters NOT getting any type of results from their investigation - they actually make stuff up and/or manipulate movement of objects; the ghost hunters getting frustrated with the lack of activity from a ""supposedly"" haunted location; not respecting their environment and/or the stories; and other stuff.

Well, the ghost hunters here are your stereo-typical batch of goof-balls. You have the overly aggressive leader that will stop at nothing to get results; the loud-mouthed & constantly cussing cameraman that would rather be somewhere else; the person that runs/screams at the least provocation; the quiet cameraman that goes into places to set up cameras by himself; and the bone-headed spiritualist that is about as fake as possible but makes a good showing for the audience.

Just like the present day reality ghost hunting TV shows, these ghost hunters go into a supposedly extremely haunted insane asylum. Yep - they get LOCKED inside (against the very vocal protests of one of the crew) for the night. After spending a few hours videoing various locations and conducting numerous EVPs, they decide to leave after getting nothing in return. Once they head for the exists, then all heck breaks loose - literally. Objects start flying around; crew members become separated/lost from the rest; the crew splits up searching for others; people disappear/die; so on and so forth.

There were a few spots that actual made me tinkle myself (just a bit). One spot was when the female crewmember gets her hair pulled. Another spot was when you first see one of the ghosts for the first time. There were a few other spots as well.

Overall, low expectations for this movie, but was pleasantly surprised by it. Again, always thought that the events portrayed in this movie would have been a good idea.

I LIKED the campy set up of it being shot by a group doing a ghostbusters show.

Some make you scream, cry, gag, clench your eyes shut and pray for the flavor to stop torturing you. And when it finally does, masochistic you NEEDS to have another piece.

I'm not going to go into what happens in the movie. I will share my experience though. i laughed, i yelled obscenities (much to my mother's dismay). I was stressed out. I screamed. I got teary eyed from fear. I choked on food that I stupidly attempted to eat while watching. I covered my eyes and peeked through my fingers which seemed to make matters worse. Horrifying...just horrifying. I love horror movies and I think I experienced my favorite one of all time today. When the movie was over and Amazon offered me Grave Encounters 2, i said aloud ""oh god, there's TWO of them?

4643417,5,B005B0QYMM,"Found-footage horror films are a dime a dozen these days, but this film definitely belongs in the highest echelon in terms of fright. Using a simple and pure setup of a team of paranormal investigators staying overnight in a haunted asylum, this movie may start like most others in a slow, world-building setup with its familiar characters, but it finishes stronger than almost all others.

One unfortunate trope for low-budget horror is that only in the last, final shot does any money get blown on an actual fleeting special effect. Not so with this one. Time after time, jump after jump, the filmmakers jam the supernatural right into the camera to terrific effect.

Another thing that elevates ""Grave Encounters"" is the desperate and deranged intensity that consumes the characters. Again, many movies will have their characters sweat and bemoan their unfortunate circumstances. But this one really delivers on a palpable and depressing dread, as characters beg for forgiveness, mercy and salvation in a truly gut-wrenching manor as their chances of survival erode.

Once the movie gets going, it does not stop. Offering a plethora of frights from subtle creepiness to overt insanity jumping at your face, it is the hallmark of all great horror films where even the banal scenes are filled with an uncomfortable tension that something might happen at any moment.

4643432,5,B005B0QYMM,"I rate this movie a five out of five for the low-budget horror/sci-fi genre (not out of every movie I've ever seen). It's truly entertaining and while having an overall cheesy back story motivating the haunting, the movie holds your interest throughout. The story takes place in an abandoned mental institute, the history of which includes an unorthodox doctor who liked to experiment on his patients (wonder who the ultimate villain is...). This is where ""Ghost Adventures"" fans will get a kick out of the movie- A crew of G.A.C. like documentarians arrive at the campus of the old institute to film the latest episode of their show, ""Grave Encounters"". As per ""Ghost Adventures"" rules, the leader of the crew announces his name (""Zac Bagans"" will be ringing in your ears) and they are ""locked down"" in the building over night. The crew, along with a supposed psychic, kick off the night by trying to act frightened or intrigued by various mild happenings (as you imagine a real film crew would) and then suddenly begin experiencing actual frightening and mysterious occurances. Believing all they need to do is wait out the night, the crew depends on the lock down ending in the morning. But according to their watches, the time for the door to be unlocked comes and goes and no one is coming back for them. This seems to be a mistake on the caretakers part, until you see what happens when they attempt to break down the front door. Things escalate from this point on, in a never-ending night. The movie makes good use of the ""documentary"" style filming; we get the Blair Witch emotional breakdowns, poltergeist damaged lighting (leaving the crew in the dark), Cloverfield/Quarantine dropping and sliding of cameras on their side capturing the demise of the crew, and all the while the movie adds new horror visuals to the genre.

What makes this movie good:
- Good acting with developed, likable characters (my fav is the Tom Waits voiced psychic)
- Fun references to well-known ghost hunting shows
- Actually seriously creepy events (what's behind the ""front door""/windows)
- A mix of suspenseful/eerie and high-action/violent

With that being said the intro was hilarious to me. It perfectly mimics the show and delivers some great ""off camera"" gags too.

It sets up as a standard ghost investigation show and mid way through it all be comes a little more real then they expected.

Not really deep and basically the whole plot right there.

Few criticisms (mind you the movie stands on its own for what it is, so below is all personal opinion):

They did an awesome job at setting up a creepy WTF type atmosphere. I do wish they would have left more to the imagination. They basically show all the deaths of the people that die, which kinda takes away the mystery of the insane asylum. It would have been great to see someone get dragged into one of the rooms, the door slams shut and all you hear are screams and maybe blood dripping from out the bottom of the door. Hitchcock style where you use your imagination to scare you to death.
(Ironic: this is from a guy who doesn't even really like horror flicks).

This would have worked well in this movie because the asylum seemed so closed in. If applied, every room would have then appeared to be a death trap.

Enough with the angry black guy!! Damn seriously it's 2014 and we still need an angry black guy in every movie? We get it, he is there to add tension and whats more scary then a haunted asylum? Ah yeah an angry black guy of course. He already had a good story, a family man and a strong need to survive to get back to his little girl. He didn't need to be so abrasive, in fact, it was in direct contrast to how he was acting earlier in the movie. Playing football and laughing / sweet talking his baby girl. Yet he was the only one to lose his cool out of the bunch. *cough* cliche *cough*

More background!!!
I usually never say this about horror flicks because really who cares? But this setup was too sweet to leave alone. They gave a great setup to a mental health doctor who worked there but I seriously wanted to know more about the Asylum. Like had anyone else disappeared there previously. What's with the time anomaly? How where the tapes eventually found? (Maybe they said this one at the beginning but i missed it) and for pete's sake how did the rats survive there if all the food spoils?

All in all it's not the best picture ever but I think that I went in not expecting much and that's why it blew me away. Enough to watch it twice and write a review.

So Grave Encounters thank you for the Encounter.",1399593600,2,2535,4.2625

It fell down a bit for me in the middle with what felt to me to be to much yelling and swearing. However, I'm sure it was used to sell the realness of it. The ""angry black guy"" thing was a bit over stated for me personally, but was acted really well. The feel of the film and the atmosphere and experience of the hospital and the fear was very well done. I have been getting into the scare genre quiet a bit as I have gotten older and it feel very real to me. Only one small part so far has felt over fake but I won't spoil it in case it works for others.

The crew goes in expecting to find a creepy location to produce their show, with maybe a scurrying rat or strange noise to provide the thrills and chills for their audience.  Unfortunately, what they encounter is far more sinister and deadly than they anticipated.  Locking themselves inside the structure for what is supposed to be an overnight stay, turns into a series of events that shock and scare everyone.  The cinematography is quite good, with the acting barely holding up at times.  Some of the actors play up their parts a bit too much, but overall this is a scary movie that is fun to watch with the lights off.

Obviously no found footage flicks will ever come close to providing the same experience that Blair Witch 1 provided, but imo Grave Encounters is more enjoyable to watch. Just keep in mind, this is not a mystery horror movie... don't expect any sort of crazy plot or deep storyline. It's just about a group of film makers finding themselves trapped in a haunted asylum.

Throw in a low budget and some cheese, and the end result is ""Grave Encounters"".

It is just one of those movies where one can clearly tell the directing was done by someone fresh out of film school, using actors a notch above the high school play set who are trying just a little too hard to act.

Of course, they actually do find the supernatural, and the movie falls apart after that.
  The initial quarter to third of the movies is REALLY well done with the build up.  The slow tour through the asylum, the fake interviews, the general build up of atmosphere in the hospital, AND, the build up of characters you want to see off'ed and a few you want to see survive, all make for a promising 1.5 hours.
  Once the proverbial crap hits the fan, though, entertainment dies much faster than the movie characters.  While the occasional morph of a normal looking ""human"" ghost to ""ghoul"" is eerie and hair raising, the vast, and I mean VAST, majority of the rest of the film is the ""film crew"" wandering the empty hallways.

This is in the ""First Person Camera"" Horror genre that's been popular starting with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and most recently with PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4.

The basic premise is that of a group of GHOST HUNTERS who are trying to investigate the mysterious happenings at an abandoned hospital.  The cast is a bunch of unknowns which, in my opinion, helps with your suspension of belief and give you the ""I'm There With Them"" effect that I like in horror films.  The group actually doesn't believe in ghosts, they simply do the show just for the bottom line and it isn't until they enter this building one night that their belief in the supernatural takes effect.

Overall, I enjoyed this film with it's genuine scares.  I like seeing movies like this in the dark as it helps to heighten the fear factor. It also helps not to be in a theater with talkative people texting and bringing their children with them to an R rated film.

There are some reasons that Michael would be killing, 1. he's insane(sometimes this theory doesn't work)2. he's controlled by a more darker demonic sort of force and so on. But what Im really trying to say is that sometimes not knowing makes a movie scarier, and that's why the sequel to grave encounters and the 7 or 8 sequels to Halloween sucked(not including 2 because that was still good in my opinion, and 3 because it has nothing to do with the Michael Myers storys but whatever).

Minor spoilers in this section.

The premise is a good one: What would happen to a ""Ghost Hunting"" film crew who encounter the paranormal for the first time?
The setup is nice with the characters being introduced, I particularly liked how the crew didn't take the ghost hunting seriously, and eventually the host paid the gardener to lie. The psychic was shown to be an actor and fraud right away and it was very apparent they considered this to be strictly entertainment.

A detraction here was the weak acting of some of the minor characters, but they are quickly off the screen.

If you've seen any ghost hunting show the formula here is correct, as they show them setting up cameras, giving a history of the building, talking about the gear, and then go about wondering in the dark trying to find ghosts while using the occasional piece of electronic equipment.  They hurried through this, but that was fine as it was just a setup.  After hours of fruitless search they take a break and it's apparent that this isn't the first time they are bored with ghost hunting.

Eventually the crew sets back out and encounters a series of paranormal events which correctly freaks them out and sends them running back to the lobby and their base location. The girl is particularly hysterical and in a believable decision they decide to pack up and leave. How is this possible? Don't people always have to make stupid decisions to advance the plot in horror movies?

Major spoilers ahead.

Just when I was getting excited that I was watching a possibly intelligent movie they writers flip the stupid and clichd switches and the whole thing goes flying off the rails faster than one can say, ""Let's split up in this horribly dangerous and frightening place.""

They immediately send the equipment guy off alone to gather up the cameras when they just ran in fear from the same area. Inexplicably he agrees to go. There goes the movie.

From this point on nothing interesting happens which hasn't happened before in a hundred horror movies shot with a shaky cam. There are ghosts who stand around looking bored then scream with big black mouths, the characters separate themselves on purpose at times and then get separated and picked off, and they run around in circles while trying to make the audience nauseous with camera shake. It could have been any group of people with some cameras in an old haunted building for the last two-thirds of the movie.

The frustrating thing is that it didn't have to be like this. Why not stick with the original tone of a cocky film crew who slowly has their belief in ghosts confirmed? The small, subtle effects and setups leading to the first encounter were frightening as the characters didn't know what was going on and it was shocking to them and the audience. This theme should have been built upon for the next hour to a climatic ending.

The answers unfortunately are likely that the writers got lazy and the studio was too nervous to break out of the shaky-cam-horror formula. It's a shame because the movie showed some promise but turned out to be typical.",1375660800,,3314,4.6638078902229845

I enjoyed this movie. I jumped a few times and felt scared throughout the 2nd half of the film. If you like horror movies and don't mind B-movie production values, I think you may be pleasantly surprised. There were two aspects of this film that reminded me so much of two other things, a video game, and a book, that I was surprised to not see them mentioned in other reviews. The first is how the building reconfigures itself and how time moves at a different rate from the outside world. This reminded me very much of the Navidson Record from the book House of Leaves. The second observation is that the movie captures the essence of wandering hallways in the video game Silent Hill 2, much better than the Silent Hill movies did. If you view the sequel to this movie Grave Encounters 2, there is also a plot point that recalls a recurring element in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. Grave Encounters is currently free to stream for Prime members, so you have nothing to lose by giving it a chance.",1374969600,,1017,4.532608695652174

4643492,5,B005B0QYMM,"Grave Encounters is a Canadian-American horror film. It is filmed in ''found footage'' style. This is a really scary movie, and I couldn't sleep properly for about a week after I first saw it. This movie is not for everyone.

The film is about a guy named Lance Preston and a group of people who are doing a reality show called ''Grave Encounters''. It is a ghost hunting reality show. The movie is one of their episodes where they go to a haunted mental institution. When they get there, they decide to film all the time. They soon realize that the place is actually haunted, and they can't stay in character anymore. They become literally terrified. They soon realize that the institution is not only haunted, it's alive. They run through the exit, and it is a whole new hallway. They look outside in the daytime, and it is still dark outside. They open their food bin, and all the food is rotten as if it's been there for months.

Some of the scary things that happen are the following:

1. A spirit moves Sasha's hair
2. Sasha wakes up, and the word ''Hello' is scratched on her back.
3. They see a woman in a room who then looks at them and her face contorts evilly
4. They find their friend Matt, who is now crazy. And he tells them ''they can all leave as soon as they're better''.
5. The group wakes up, and they are wearing patient bracelets with their names on them.
6. A girl who killed herself comes out of a bathtub filled with blood and grabs one of the crew members, then they both disappear
7. Many black arms come out of the walls and ceiling and start grabbing at them
8. Lance walks down a hallway, and an evil spirit runs at him and starts hitting the camera
9. Lance records himself and plays it back, and he hears spirits on his tape
10. Lance is trapped in a long underground hallway, and he hears spirits screaming and laughing.
11. The scene where Lance finds pictures of his friends being lobotomized.
12. The ending scene where Lance talks to the camera after the spirits have lobotomized him.

This is a really original and horrifying movie. Sean Rogerson and Ashleigh Gryzko are good actors and they play their characters really well. It's a good and original horror film.",1374364800,,2201,4.4405940594059405

4643494,5,B005B0QYMM,"Whoa ! What a great movie ! I normally only only write reviews about concert DVDs these days, but this flick was such a shock to my system I felt compelled to convey my impressions on it.

I'm not one to give away the plot so I'll stick to the basics here : a group of amateur fellas shooting a pilot for a paranormal investigation series lock themselves up in an abandoned mental institution for one night. They do not even believe in the paranormal and are in it for the cash. But many a spooky surprise await them as the night develops.

This is another camcorder movie in the vein of The Blairwitch Project -which started the trend to begin with- only SO much better. It caused me to literally JUMP in my couch and gave me a sweaty nightmare that night, and I'm a 52-year-old fella and a seasoned horror movie buff who thought nothing could shock me anymore; man was I wrong !They didn't even resort to music to create the atmos and that's a tough acomplishment.

The film is fantastically edited with great 1.78:1 pic (so it filled my screen,unlike so many horribly letterboxed movies that are OK at the movies but make you feel cheated if your TV is less than 50) with great sound to match. Loved the very convincing acting, the CGI -which I normally don't care for- and the fact that the purposely bland beginning gives way to one of the spookiest films I've ever watched.

She was the most afraid when something happened and the main guy that signed off was always looking for more film even as they delved into more obvious things that made it clear they were no longer just dealing with some comedic paranormal show.  There weren't many scares but the ones they had were genuine.  It wasn't a slasher flick, it wasn't quite psychological thriller because some elements were just too cliche but overall its a good movie and I will probably pay to see the sequel even though I know sequel sucks usually.  The last 20 minutes are the best, it doesn't use anything special.  It simply shows someone desperate.  I like how with the girl they didn't explain why she felt the way she did later on.

4643515,5,B005B0QYMM,"When one hears the words ""Supernatural"", ""Horror"", and ""Found-Footage Film"" in the same descriptor they do not prepare for a very exciting movie. By-and-large because of the low budget it costs to film one you're looking at anything between terrible and merely average, few reaching above this. So as a horror fan it was with no small amount of joy that about thirty-minutes into this movie I recognized this wasn't just a good example of how to do a film in the genre, it's THE example. It's the best found-footage film you'll ever watch bar-none and even makes solid headway into the legion of good horror films in general.

The secret? Multiple cameras, decent actors, mostly likable characters, and a distinct style that steps away from enough of the usual horror trappings to be unique.

I won't spoil much of the story and scares to be had beyond what you can see in five-minutes but suffice it to say one of the films strengths comes from its setting, a group of paranormal investigators ""investigating"". Some people note the beginning of the film as a weakness but I disagree as I felt it built up the characters just enough to care, without being overly long. And at the same time provided the backdrop for giving us the many fixed cameras, and orienting ourselves with who was carrying which mobile camera so that when the action started we aren't confused. Additionally all these cameras mean that we rarely get the ""shakey cam"" the genre is so well known for. Eventually things go REALLY wrong and this is again to the films unique credit, unlike a movie like Paranormal Activity the bumps in the night only last about ten minutes in this film, then you're treated to a full-on paranormal experience filled with malice and terror.

Beyond this there truly isn't that much story, settling for focusing on the characters descent into this hellscape and though it will depend on your opinion I did not find this a negative. Often a film can lose its horror if the story becomes overwrought or is simply bad, the directors of Grave Encounters realized this and don't give a lot of answers except for a few excerpts throughout, and one (glaringly bad to be honest) scene at the end. This allows them to instead focus on the increasingly fearful characters, most of who are acted with enough skill to make this a valid tactic.

Some of the actors are distinctly better than others but none of them are outright bad, with even the worst settling somewhere at average. The same could be said for the characters which is a massive boon for the film. The lead is legitimately believable as a host for a show and as a man scared out of his wits later on, as is the only female character even if her screams become a bit tedious even if they are warranted, the rest of the characters fall below them but a supposed psychic for the show gets special-credit for being distinctly non-psychic when the cameras stop rolling. The only lackluster character is one of the cameramen who moves further into denial the longer the film goes on, while a reasonable emotion to feel they could definitely have expressed this in a better way than yelling, ""THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!"" five-hundred times. He's definitely the movies one great and prevalent weakness. A nod goes to the ""guests"" for the show before they lock themselves in for the night that do a good job of locals unused to and slightly nervous in front of the camera.

Filled with tension, both from legitimate ambiance and jump-scares the film Grave Encounters is not to be missed. It will never get the attention it deserves but this is a textbook example of how one should do a found-footage film, and I most definitely suggest you watch it.",1365379200,15,3693,4.6753846153846155
4643516,4,B005B0QYMM,"GRAVE ENCOUNTERS starts out as a parody of those ""reality"" ghost hunter shows, complete w/ an overly-dramatic host, a psychic, and an occult expert.

Next, along w/ their film crew, our paranormal investigators enter an abandoned, supposedly haunted mental institution. After having themselves locked in for the night, our fearless adventurers set up their equipment, and settle in for what they believe will be a long, dull evening.

Although horror is perhaps my favorite genre, it is riddled with horrible films. So, I went into Grave Encounters with my usual low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that this was a well-done movie with some genuinely creepy moments, some really freaky ghosts, and a nice job at building up the tension.

From the typical happy-go-lucky group of young adults going to look for ghosts, to some slightly disturbing moving furniture and hair flicking, all the way to some truly disturbing downright scary as hell demons and freakish monstrosities, there's a progression here that I did not expect. The effects are convincing. The 'monsters' are shown clearly which I appreciate, but are not over-the-top and do not feel like cheap CG.

This film reminded me alot of Blair Witch, which is an excellent film in my opinion. Although I would give the nod to that film for it's innovation at the time, I would say that Grave Encounters is even more well-done, although perhaps derivative. The end scene was actually quite horrific. One thing I can say, I'll be thinking about this movie anytime I consider spending the night in a 'haunted place'.

Specifically targeting the unintentional humor and camp of Travel Channel's ""Ghost Adventures,"" The Vicious Brothers play up the over-the-top nature of the show's hosts and the sensationalism of their so-called ""evidence."" These gimmicks pay off in the first third, where the stupid actions taken by the idiotic characters actually serve to disarm the viewer against the initial scares. Trouble comes later, when the subtleties of moving objects and slamming doors give way to a ridiculous special effects show. What little amount of believability the film had achieved up until this point is thrown out the window.

It is worth picking up and watching probably around Halloween time and with maybe a few beers in hand :) All in all a very solid ghost movie which is actually very entertaining to watch so either rent it or buy it but you need to watch it. The second is also coming out very soon so if you liked this one then go check out the second one when it does release.,1358812800,,431,4.08235294117647
4643539,1,B005B0QYMM,"Grave Encounters (The Vicious Brothers, 2011)

...and if you thought, correctly, that Episode 50 (q.v. elsewhere this ish) was bad, let me introduce you to Grave Encounters, a movie that feels as if it was made by taking the script for Episode 50, giving it one more rewrite to extinguish any faint embers there might have been of something halfway decent in it, and then the loose, unbound pages of the script were tossed into the air and picked up at random--and then the movie was filmed in the order in which the pages were picked up. (Any page that was picked up upside-down or backwards was shot as-is, with the cast trying to make sense of upside-down language or simply inserting five minutes of silence per blank page.) Now, I hasten to add that the above is an artist's conception of what may have happened during the filming of Grave Encounters; I have no inside information in this regard. But that's certainly what it felt like to me.

Plot: A burgeoning Ghost Adventures-style show (we find out early on that this is footage that would have been edited down to form the sixth episode of the series) arranges to spend the night in a haunted asylum. Unlike normal procedure, when the caretaker of the asylum is supposed to ""lock them in overnight"", he actually does, so the team can't do things like get extra equipment from the truck. Or escape, when they find out that unlike the places they normally produce shows, this one really is haunted. All they can do is wait for sunrise, and the return of the caretaker...

...and I can't really get into what really made this movie so entirely awful without getting past that point, because that's where it all goes into the toilet--not that it wasn't most of the way there anyway, with acting that is at its best on the borderline of terrible, even worse lighting problems than one normally has with this sort of found-footage claptrap, etc. What I can tell you is that once we get to that point, the movie's sense of pace, which was already kind of wavering between ""dragging"" and ""mumblecore"", went over the cliff. I almost think I understand what Bros. Vicious were attempting to do with the pacing there, but without giving too much away, I'll say that it reminds me of the philosophy I have always believed James Joyce used when writing ""The Dead"" (if you want to write a story about dreadfully boring people, write a dreadfully boring story). And if so, I will give them that it takes guts to try something like that, because if it doesn't work, it's going to be a spectacular failure.

Unfortunately, that's exactly what Grave Encounters is. ",1358208000,2,2608,4.648590021691974
4643540,3,B005B0QYMM,"About the same as a lot of the movies made in this style of ""real"" but not really real.  Acting is okay, plot is fairly typical.  I did enjoy it but..  Good for a night when nothing else is on.",1357776000,,193,3.775
4643541,5,B005B0QYMM,"I find it interesting that most if not all of the bad reviews are of the Amazon Instant Video, while the better and good reviews are of the DVD. Why do you suppose that is? Is there a difference in the content of the film or the fact you're watching the Instant Video on a computer or other device, while the DVD is probably viewed on a television in a darkened room? Personally, I thought this movie was very well done. I'm more into the type of film that leaves something to your imagination as opposed to the gory slash'em films which are so obvious. Something that is atmospheric and leaves a little more to your imagination is far better. And this movie sure did that and more.",1357603200,,682,4.3359375
4643542,4,B005B0QYMM,"If you're the kind of person who likes your scares to be more . . . obvious (ghosts, chainsaw-wielding madmen, demons, etc), you might not like Grave Encounters. Grave Encounters's brand of spooky is more atmospheric. It's also a bit slower paced. If you like your movies fast-paced you probably won't enjoy Grave Encounters. Anyway. . .

Basically, the story is about how a crew of ""ghost-hunters"" (in quotes because they're actually part of a reality show) locks themselves inside a reportedly haunted insane asylum/hospital for the night. They want to see if they can make contact with ghosts.

Night falls and that's when things start to get eerie. An opened window here, the slight creak of an abandoned wheelchair there--the team begins to fall apart as their contact with the ghosts gets too close for comfort.

The movie builds tension through the darkness and the sense of claustrophobia the hospital halls provoke.

The ending wraps the story up well enough. It leaves some unanswered questions, but that's pretty typical of a ""found footage"" type of movie.",1357084800,,1067,5.011299435028248
4643543,3,B005B0QYMM,"If you've watched even a few episodes of those paranormal phenomenon shows hosted by a moody, hardkor, spikey-haired white guy, and if you know how ridiculous they are, then you'll get a kick out of this parody film.  I was a little skeptical going in, after seeing the gratuitous use of the ""demon face morphing"" software in the trailer.  It's purposefully cheesy in parts, notably when the main character slaps on his ""cool mysterious ghost hunter"" facade.  And he's absolutely dead on.  Paranormal shows ARE this cheesy.  It's when the scares get real that the cheesy farce falls apart and things get interesting.

There's scarcely a plot for the movie to cling to, causing it to lapse in places and feel longer than it actually is, but the gradual build up of scares is worth the slow moments.  The characters, though unremarkable, are fairly likable and some even relatable (i.e. T.C. whose family background is briefly mentioned).

This review makes it seem like I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel (with found footage films, you kind of are...), BUT I did enjoy it.  Some of the creeps and scares were unexpected and the ending was a nice touch.",1356912000,3,1154,4.787878787878788

4643545,5,B005B0QYMM,"This really is one of my favorite horror movies, period. The opening can seem a bit cheesy, but you'll notice the humor of it all if you've ever watched any paranormal investigation shows, especially Ghost Adventures. The opening montage for the show within the movie is ripped directly from Ghost Adventures and is one of my favorite parts of the movie. The thing I liked best about this movie is that you're never really wondering why the characters are making so many stupid moves. They are genuinely trapped with no way out. They stick together when it's appropriate to do so, and split up when you would probably decide it was best to split up. The acting isn't great and a bit two-dimensional, but I definitely got the vibe that this was done to take a bit of a jab at the investigation shows it's taking a jab at. As things get more tense, the characters gain a bit more depth and, by the end, I can't guarantee that you'll feel connected to the characters, but there's definitely a great chance of that happening. All in all, a great movie but it does walk a line between taking itself seriously and not doing so, so I think you'll get a lot more from it if you don't expect much from it and just look forward to watching a really fun, well-crafted horror film.",1355875200,36,1269,4.450643776824034

It was the cheesy acting by the lead character and the cutaway shaky cams BUT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY ON PURPOSE, so actually the film does exactly what it is trying to achieve.  It is a mock ghost hunting show.  So if ghost hunting shows is your thing, then you will relate immediately to what the movie is aiming for.  As with all horror movies, I recommend to anyone watching to watch it in the dark.  It will get you to jump in many memorable scenes and will give you a story that you will never guess the ending to and leave you wanting more.",1353024000,,643,4.104

The haunted insane asylum may have been done before, but it makes the setting sufficiently creepy. There were some good tension filled scenes that made me jump as well. My biggest problem was the inconsistency in the characters. Their personalities were all over the place (of course I have never been trapped in a haunted building, so who is to say how ones personality may transform). The ending felt a little rushed. Overall I would recommend this movie if you need to kill a couple hours late at night.",1348617600,,614,4.590909090909091
4643573,4,B005B0QYMM,"I'm quit the fan of found footage horror films, and I was very pleased with Grave Encounters. The film builds the atmosphere very well, by allowing the supernatural events to start small and then grow as the night continues. The characters are well established, and I found the obvious jab at Paranormal State very amusing (I especially found the main actors channeling of Ryan Buell's self-important airs was spot on, as was the ""off camera"" hoaxing.)

There are some flaws. A few of the special effects fail, but generally they do a very good job of keeping the over the top special effects to a minimal to avoid them looking too cheesy.  Part of the ending is clich, and didn't really need to be part of the film. It's scary enough to think of a doctor experimenting on his patients unscrupulously for science.  The added ""surprise"" motivation ( I won't go into it to spoil the end) is just cheesy.

The actors are very convincing however, and I very much liked how the movies messes with time, and physical space, and the idea that less is more in what you see.  While it's not a perfect horror film, it's one of the better in the found footage genre.",1347926400,,1155,4.533653846153846

In following a small group of boldly stupid reality TV producers, out to capture cheap footage of supernatural events, it uncovers the requisite amount of creepy crawlies and recycled scares by way of night vision lens and shaky hand-held camera. It deserves credit for finding a great setting (an abandoned mental institution that might be a cliche if it weren't so effective) and for resisting the urge to go completely over the top during the closing scenes. Too many good setups of this kind are blown on an indulgent final act, (Paranormal Activity, I'm looking at you here) so it's nice to see one that's able to keep its chills relegated to short, efficient bursts. The entire cast is thoroughly unsympathetic, though, and their intrepid leader is the worst of the worst.

It all starts off with a group of intrepid paranormal investigative journalists or TV rip off chancers as some would call them, having their tapes found by the TV Company. They are doing a pilot series called `Grave Encounters' where they investigate haunted places and film the lot using the latest in ghost spotting technology, including Geiger counters and ectoplasm sensitive cameras - yeah right. Well any hoo they are on episode six - `the haunted asylum'- where they are at a former mental hospital. This was a place where experimental medicine was carried out on the patients, including frontier lobotomies, institutionalised abuse, suicide and murder - bwaaah!

Led by naked self promotionalist, front man Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson) they pull out all the stops to ramp up the fright levels for the viewer, as Lance says `with slow motion and the right music behind it, everything is creepy'. So they go for a voluntary `lockdown' for eight hours on the building, the care taker will return at 6 am to let them out. They then rig up the building with cameras to take advantage of known `cold spots' to capture the other worldly goings on, then the bumps in the night begin and all of a sudden things aren't that funny anymore.

This is a first outing for writers and directors `The Vicious Brothers', and I must say boys you have made quite an entrance. I was genuinely cacking myself on more than one occasion and what is more impressive is that as these are supposed to be edited down `found tapes' there is no music to aid in ramping up the fear factor. As this is yet another `found tape', film, there will inevitably be comparisons to the likes of `Blair Witch Project', `Cloverfield' and even `Troll Hunter'. This though deserves recognition in its own right as adding to the genre rather than reinventing or stealing from it. We do have lots of different camera types which are used to great effect to maximise the atmosphere of fear.

It runs for an increasingly scary 92 minutes, but there is no filler here so not only is it about right in length, but it is one of those that almost feels much shorter. I am now awaiting the next offering from the brothers who actually are Colin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz, and we won't have long as they are putting the finishing touches to the imaginatively named `Grave Encounters 2', which I wish them every success with - this is one to watch, but with the lights on.",1341187200,,2678,4.5845511482254695

They are to realize the folly too late, as they find themselves trapped inside the abandoned building.

Directed by the Vicious Brothers (actually Collin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz), ""Grave Encounters"" looks like a cross between ""Paranormal Activity""-like so-called found-footage genre and a more orthodox ""haunted house"" horror film. The combination is not really a new idea, and the film spends too much time setting up the second half of it, where things get much better.

In the first half of the film, what you will see you have seen somewhere else in a more effective way. Some sequences are creepy, but not scary enough for avid fans of the genre, who would find the film's scares predictable. This is not to say the mocumentary horror film is totally unoriginal. There is one intriguing idea about the surreal condition the hapless film crew is in - they are literally trapped inside the disused hospital in a supernatural way.

This is when the film gets interesting. ""Grave Encounters"" is pretty entertaining if you can sit through the dull first half.",1339286400,,1262,4.943396226415095

4643584,4,B005B0QYMM,"I actually thought this was gonna be a funny film making fun of Zak and the boys on the Ghost Adventures show. It opens with the premise of a guy who narrates our way into the ""recorded footage"". You see them pay off some guy to say there were ghosts, the theatrics they place to make the non-happenings as exciting. As the film progressed, I had realized they were not spoofing the show at all, but it starts to really get creepy. I think thats what made it scarier for me was that I was expecting to laugh.

But whats starts as little incidents of rappings, lights going on and off and the usual ""what was that!?"" hysteria. But then the s**t really starts to hit the fan and it becomes unrelentless. Some of the logic gets thrown askew for scare tactics, and if you are critical of the human response factor to a situation such as this, then it might take away some of the appreciation of the scares. The one criticism I have of ALL found footage film is the inability to let go of the camera for any reason. So much so that people will die holding it. I don't get the impression is used only for a light source.

It takes place in an abandoned mental hospital (of course!) And like all abandoned mental hospitals, bad things have happened there and have left an indelible scar upon its psyche. So, now the ghosts who were once patients run the asylum and are more mad than they were in life.

There are lots of cameras and I must have missed some of the set up, but there seems to be lots of angles besides the single camera.

The ""apparitions"" manifest are not really ghosts, but seems physical and demonic beings of a sort. So I am not sure what they are. Despite these logical loopholes, there are some very good special effects and a bigger budget is at hand than it might appear.

I have to say the beginning was kind of long and draw out and they definitely could have cut out at least 15 minutes but when they started exploring the hospital, it started getting crazy. I would have to say that this movie had more twists, dark moments and scares than the first two paranormal activities and the blair witch project combined.

I can't imagine anyone's reading this that hasn't already seen the movie or read 20+ other reviews already...

I don't see what was special about the characters.  I feel like back when I was 15, if I was in any of these actors' bodies, I would have played each character exactly like they were played.  The characters felt 'true'... and not stupid... and not immature... but just somehow hollow from an adult's perspective, like the ideas you had when you were 15.  I'm not sure if this was due to (1) bad actors, (2) a bad script, or (3) bad directing.  I feel like it's a little bit of everything, with emphasis on 2 and 3.

I also don't see why a lot of reviewers seemed to like the story.  Film crew locks themselves inside an old abandoned psychiatric hospital; scary s*** starts to happen; they're actually locked in forever; they go crazy like the former patients.  The one semi-cool though probably-been-done-before advent were the exits changing and it never getting light outside.  But even that... it takes a second to digest and you feel like you're now a step ahead of the director.

Now that being said, the film was really scary.  From midway through to finish, very scary.  All of the scares were jump scares, as you'd expect with a movie filmed in the dark in a maze of a place, but the tension was built up pretty well from scene to scene.  That's why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1, which I'd give based on the other criteria.

I can see scary movie purists tearing this to shreds.  And frankly I'm not surprised that this went straight to DVD, even with the found footage formula being a success on the whole.",1333411200,,1700,4.524590163934426

4643591,5,B005B0QYMM,"Every so often a movie comes along that delights to no end. It's one of those movies that not everyone has heard of or that actually lives up to the hype that preceded it. When it happens, which is rare, it is one of the best times you have with a movie. Such is the case with GRAVE ENCOUNTERS.

The movie falls into the category of lost footage films that became popular with both THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films. Both were films put together with supposedly lost footage of some group or person that just now were being released. That happens here as a producer of reality television shows opens by telling us about the proposed series called ""Grave Encounters"". It was supposedly ahead of it's time, a reality show about ghost hunters before they were common.

Led by Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson), the group investigates haunted locations in an attempt to offer proof of the paranormal. In reality as we watch this raw footage unroll we learn that it's all a gag to him and his crew, a group that doesn't actually believe in ghosts let alone having seen one. To them this is nothing more than a way to get on TV and be known, a way to make money.

Along with Lance we have Matt White (Juan Riedinger) their tech specialist, Sasha Parker (Ashleigh Gryzko) a paranormal expert, camera man T.C. Gibson (Merwin Mondesir) and renowned psychic Houston Gray (Mackenzie Gray) who is actually an actor pretending to be a psychic. This group comes together to prove or debunk the supernatural in the series. With five episodes in the can they head out to their latest location, an abandoned asylum where nefarious tests were run on the inmates and where a few of them escaped to take down the doctor who committed these deeds and kill him.

At first we see them try and coerce a handyman into claiming he saw a ghost for $20 and get to hear from a local historian who gives them the background on the location. Afterwards the current care taker unlocks the building and lets them in, padlocking the door from the outside once they're in (lockdowns are a part of several ghost hunting shows on air now). Matt sets up cameras in steady positions throughout the building and the crew has equipment of their own and the show begins filming.

Nothing happens at first. The stage is being set for the viewer, that feeling of disbelief and the hope that something will happen only intensified by the setting and the use of night vision cameras shooting in the dark. If you hate hand held camera films you might not like this one but its not as intrusive as some have been in the past. There's a feeling of dread in the air as they walk the abandoned halls finding wheel chairs overturned gurneys. But little happens at first.

When it does it's something simple. A tug, a push and finally we see Sasha's hair lifted by something not there. While this may seem spooky to us it's even worse for those involved as this is the first actual paranormal encounter that any of them have experienced. They are in over their head and soon find that these ghosts want to do more than just play with them.

As things progress from bad to worse, they decided to stick together in the lobby and shut down the shooting. They have enough to put together and episode and have had enough. Sending Matt to pick up all the stationery cameras, he disappears and the group soon find themselves searching for him. And while doing so, they encounter more than they can handle.

There's the set up of the movie. It was seen in the previews that were available before it was released. And for some reason it never got a wide or well played release to theaters which is sad. That's because this movie offers more scares and jumps, more creepy and chilling sequences than any movie I've seen in quite some time. While the similarly themed PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was gave me goose bumps, this one gave me more scares and had me more frightened at times. And even in scenes where you knew something was going to happen, the tension was so well developed that you felt relief after jumping.

The actors are all quite believable. While none of them are well known recognizable faces it works to their advantage. It would be hard to believe someone like Tom Cruise as Lance knowing that he's, well, Tom Cruise. With unrecognizable faces you believe that maybe this really is lost footage. Okay not really but it helps make it more believable.

Being a fan of horror films its rare for me to watch one and not feel cheated these days. So many go for the cheap scare, the gore extreme or the simple torture porn film, never relying on atmosphere. This movie drips with atmosphere. Although made on a small budget you'd never know while watching it. Instead you hope that no current group of ghost hunters have to experience what this team does. The movie is one of the best horror films I've seen in years. And having watched so many of them that's saying something.",1332201600,5,4941,4.547806524184477
4643592,3,B005B0QYMM,"Periodically, I get a hankering for scary movies. Tonight, at the local rental store, I found Grave Encounters.

When I rent movies, I take my iPhone and scan the bar code. It takes me to Amazon where I check two things: (a) the rating, and (b) the customer comments. I don't usually rent movies below 3.5 stars. Four is my gold standard. Three stars is a risk that, admittedly, occasionally pays off. But my sweet spot is four stars.

Grave Encounters was a solidly rated movie so I thought I'd take a chance.

The opening was beyond cheesy. The jittery, jerky hand-held camera work was making me ill. I kept thinking, ""These are supposed to be documentary film makers who shoot reality TV shows and they can't even hold a camera steady for three seconds?""

For the record, I abhor jittery, quick-cut movies. I've walked out of them at the theater, and I've avoided seeing them once I read reviews about them. Such camera work is the sign of a director painfully low on talent, and even more bereft of ideas. Often, that kind of camera work is a failed attempt to hide a bad story, or bad acting, or both.

So I was worried when Grave Encounters began and all I saw was an attempt to look edgy and ""real.""

Eventually, once the actors got inside the mental institution, it got better. The camera work wasn't as nauseating and the movie finally kicked into gear.

The old mental institution was truly creepy. It, alone, was worth seeing. But what could have been a very, very unsettling movie deteriorated into parody by people who kept splitting up into excursions, alone, into dark places. Like when they sent the equipment guy to gather up all the static cameras. Really? They're trying to get out of a scary situation and they send the guy to take down and bring back all the cameras placed throughout the hospital? Seriously?

Needless to say, that guy disappeared.

The acting - especially by the Goth chick - was pretty bad. I never once bought that she was anything more than an actor trying to look scared. She was nice to look at. But she added nothing to the movie.

Then the ""monsters"" came out. And they were pretty hokey. There wasn't really an explanation as to why the ghosts of dead mental patients would become monsters with unhinged mouths and a desire to kill. But there they were.

This movie could have been a home run. It was an interesting premise. But the execution was flawed.

I recommend Grave Encounters, but with reservations. I thought it was okay. Nothing great.

Your mileage may vary.",1331510400,3,2518,4.59375
4643593,1,B005B0QYMM,"This film really mocks the Ghost Adventure show from the Travel channel. Basically this film is Ghost Adventures with ""Youtube greenscreen special affects"". I believe the show wanted to be scary but it really comes off as being obnoxious. It takes bits of elements or key parts from the Ghost Adventure random episodes that you'll recognize as they manifest throughout this film. The main character of the show Lance Preston(Sean Rogerson)gave me the feeling like he didn't want to be in the film by his acting alone. The acting overall is bad, the scares are typical in these found lost tapes genre, shaky cameras, over frustrating acting and bad writing. A combination of what makes a terrible reality film that is not reality but only that its really aweful.

By the end finale, I felt the movie creaters, were giving Ghost Adventures a big F.U. and sending a message to them saying that if you are going to be fake, go all the way by adding artificial ghost or scares like they did. This movie was lame and a waste of time.

4643595,2,B005B0QYMM,"Spoilers

I saw the trailer for this somewhere on the internet, it was getting passed around and it looked pretty good, a rather low budget film passing along through word of mouth, who knows? Could be the next blair witch/paranormal activity, and the story was pretty interesting as well, ghost hunters being stuck in a mental asylum? The possibilities are endless!

But then you meet the characters...

The 'main' character you're apparently supposed to relate with is a total a**hole, he has his token love interest that says nothing worthwhile, the token black guy who has lines like ""man i could be smokin' some trees right now"", the old guy that looked like Mick Jagger, and the idiot cameraman who looks like Shaggy from scooby doo. Wow, I mean I get that they're making some comment on all those ghost-hunting shows but you could at least put a little more character into these crude stereotypes to make the audience care about what's happening.

And this was my biggest problem with Grave Encounters, dumbed down lame two dimensional parodies of what Grave Encounters is trying to lampoon while imitating. Confused yet? Don't worry this movie doesn't require much thought. The handheld camera genre works best if you like the characters you're following around, because you're essentially stuck with them, and here I'd rather be hanging out with the ghosts/demons/whatever than these tools.

The story itself was intriuging but ultimately a letdown, the set up was nice, they paced it out ok and some of the background stories (fake or not) helped set up the sense of dread which clashed nicely with the crew's naivety. Once the scares kick in though there's very little that's original and hasn't been seen before from Grave Encounters. Although I did like the film's answer to the ancient question ""why don't they just leave the building"", as it gets interesting when the mental hospital becomes a twisted maze.

One of the things that worked in what I consider the best handheld camera movie [REC] was they were zombies/demons and they had a physical threat that you could understand. Here what exactly is the threat with the ghosts, they lift some stuff up sure, but that's about it. Maybe someone could've gotten possessed or something to make a real threat instead of windows opening. Oh and speaking of [REC] this movie shamelessly ripped off the ending where the last person confronts the 'original monster' or whatever and gets offed, AND they ripped off the death scene in [REC]2 where someone gets pulled into water and disappears; it was cool in [REC]2 when it was original, but it was just pathetic in this film. The 'Vicious Brothers' couldn't think of anything else?

Also when it ends, it just ends and doesn't wrap itself up full circle with the opening of the movie where you see a producer or something introducing the audience to the 'lost footage', it might as well have been the directors saying 'we hope you'll enjoy Grave Encounters!' since it served no purpose than to open the film. If you're a fan of ghost movies or handheld camera movies, chances are you've seen everything in Grave Encounters before and done better, except the arms scene, that was pretty cool. Oh wait did I say pretty cool? I meant pretty RIPPED OFF (watch?v=VcQdP0YxAfk)",1330128000,,3279,4.876122082585279

4643597,5,B005B0QYMM,"This flick really surprised me.  I'm so glad I took a chance on this one.  Flicks like this and The Hazing (2004) inspire me to continue taking chances when Netflix or Amazon throws a weird suggestion my way.  I give this a direct-to-DVD horror ""A"".

This movie operates much like The Last Exorcism (2010).  We follow Lance Preston and his Ghost Hunters film crew into a haunted mental hospital in search of the paranormal.  It comes off as a satire, with a lot of sophomoric sarcasm and a totally fake medium.  They laugh about things being ""too over the top"" between cuts and they pay a gardener twenty bucks to lie about seeing a ghost on the property.  This works out fantastically!  Normally the first 20-30 minutes of any horror are painful.  They have barely-trained actors and a perfunctory storyline.  Grave Encounters, however, has good acting and draws a lot of smiles as we learn about the film crew.  This also serves as a superior directorial device to engage the viewers into caring about these characters.

The story is simple and certainly nothing new.  The crew locks themselves into the abandoned hospital from 10pm-6am, giving them eight hours in total darkness to catch some paranormal activity on film.  They get a tour from the caretaker and hear a few ""real"" ghost stories about the place to hype up their show (called Grave Encounters) and choose where to place static cameras.

The execution is more like the Paranormal Activity films (2007, 2010, 2011).  There's a lot of slow tension build-up and you find yourself concentrating on the screen; staring waiting for something to move and listening for a subtle sound (like White Noise (2005)).  This is a style that I love, but many people don't like this.

What caught me off guard is that while everything was done surprisingly well in terms of acting, effects, sets, scares, and directing, the writing seemed very misguided.  Not the dialogue, but the events.  At first things seem sensible.  Some random objects move here and there.  But as the movie progresses and the intensity of the paranormal activity amplifies, the events seem less connected.  The writers mix elements of ""ghost"" movies with elements of ""house"" movies.  In the movie, Lance explains that there are static and intelligent hauntings.  Static haunting account for the ""house"" movie subgenre, in which there is an energy echoing a past event (but there is no specific ghost, demon or spirit).  Intelligent hauntings are our ""ghost"" story subgenre, in which a paranormal entity has some motivation and responds to human presence.  In most horror movies, the writing will choose one subgenre or the other.  Really never both.

Anyway, this subgenre combo doesn't work.  People start disappearing or dying and we don't know why.  Some weird things happen that make me want to guess ""why this is happening"" or ""what the ghost wants"" or ""what happened in the hospital"" or ""are the crew members somehow linked to the hospital?""  Ultimately, I was hit with a lot of red herrings which served no end.  As a result, the end of the movie was simply when we ran out of people to kill or mysteriously disappear.  I wanted a little more.

Despite this big overall writing flaw, each individual scene worked well.  I enjoyed every five minute piece of the movie.  But after the first 30 minutes, the scenes just failed to make a story when assembled chronologically.

However critical I may sound, I really enjoyed this and strongly recommend it to any of you who enjoy occasionally taking a chance on an unknown direct-to-DVD horror.",1328400000,7,3570,4.867109634551495
4643598,5,B005B0QYMM,"I didn't really know much about the movie going in, and had low expectations because of poor to mediocre reviews. I'm very glad I gave it a chance.  The beginning is a bit corny as you're introduced to the last footage taken by a television crew shooting for a ghost hunters type show.  This was a shoot for their sixth show in the series, and that footage they shot is the movie.  They are to spend the night in an abandoned psychiatric hospital, to try to document any supernatural phenomena.  I think any fan of horror can piece together the rest.  And it doesn't end well for the crew, but the course it takes was often creative and felt fresh.

I thought the film was great especially for being low budget, and the special effects mixed in well with the visual style they chose to use.  The special effects were done well and at times had a ""how did they do that?"" feel like in Paranormal Activity.  There were times where they chose to point the camera away at specific times, but I didn't mind that so much because I felt it was done tastefully (adding tension to the scenes).  The acting was also great and the fear you see in the actors felt genuine.  The acting was good and I was convinced that I was behind the scenes with a small television crew.  I was also reminded of a Tales from the Crypt episode (i think one that came directly from the EC comic series actually)that is very similar.  So the idea isn't all that new, but again the cast and crew did a great job and it shows.

Now that I've seen it, I'm kinda surprised by all the lackluster reviews it has been getting.  I'm a long time horror fan, and I felt like this was a great treatment of the genre.  In a time when horror is all over the place (It's a great time to be a fan of horror! And I hope that continues), this one was right down the middle for me.  It's a classic haunted house film at its core.  And while the course the story take makes creative turns it never tries to be something else.  And that's a good thing in my opinion.  It spoke to that primal fear, or unease of being alone in dark places.  It was very much like watching a terrible nightmare.  So I say give the film a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised.

Also, it might be easy to write this off as a Paranormal Activity clone at first glance but I guarantee this is something different.  I've enjoyed a couple films in that series too, but I think this one does a little better job immersing you into the experience.  More of this film is in a first person perspective than occurs in Paranormal Activity.  You feel like your running through the corridors, hiding in rooms, and experiencing the fright alongside the crew.  (Don't get me wrong, the Paranormal Activity films are great.  I'm just trying to point out where they differ)",1327449600,2,2793,4.321153846153846

And even bribing ppl to lie about the supernatural? LOL! It's a major cheese fest...until the doors are locked. Then, the movie takes a 180 degree turn and becomes truly scary. I thought the CGI was pretty good, especially the ""tongueless"" monster. That thing creeped me out! The thing in the bathtub was also very scary. I give this fright flick 4 instead of 5 stars because I could not stand the dialogue. Every other word was the F word. F this and F that. It got annoying and killed some of the tension. The acting was very good though, and the atmosphere was oh so terrifying. If you like low budget ""mockumentary"" horror, then give this a watch. It's worth it, and lives up to the hype given by the infamous trailer. There is one scene that seems to be inspired by Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"" that is both scary and hilarious at the same time, that is worthy of mention.
The special features are okay...an interview with the directors and producer, along with a short making of featurette. The directors are the average, cliche emo/goth sensationalists who seem to milk to culture for all its worth.

4643612,2,B005B0QYMM,"When I first saw the trailer on you tube prior to the release I was really excited. The first 2/3rds of the movie was entertaining  and seemed to be building very well into something worthy of the views time... then it falls apart into a total and utter amateur disappointment. Like the failed Lonely Island pilot for Fox ""Awesometown"" amateur disappointment or a really bad student project for an After Effects class disappointment.

The film starts off with 5 people shooting a Ghost Hunting TV show, who lock themselves in a haunted, abandon mental institution which looks way to clean to have been abandon for more then a few days, which can be over looked. Trouble starts as the crew is beginning to wrap shooting up for the evening. Typical ghost hunting show type stuff starts happening and suspense starts to build at a decent pace and we start to see the interesting scenes from the trailer. Shortly after the scene from the trailer where the girl turns around and morphs into a creature is where the wheels completely fall off the bus. At the point where hands start coming out of the walls and ceiling is when it's time to shut it off because it marks the point where this film turns into little more then an amateur remake of the Blair Witch Project complete with the camera dropping to the floor, off screen ending with screaming to imply what is happening to the final victim.

I truly had high hopes for this film after seeing the trailer and the leaps that digital video has had over the past few years. The real problem is the non-climax and ""been done before"" ending. Truly an utterly disappointing, I can see why it's only available on Pay-Per-View and didn't have a true theatrical release. Not worth the money to rent, maybe check it out when it eventually makes it to the SyFy Channel for free. 2 stars because I was enjoying myself in the beginning before it completely fell apart.",1318723200,4,1904,4.610619469026549

It's slow at first, but there's alot of setting up to be done. About midway through the film it really starts to get scary. I recommend this movie to any horror buff looking for a good scare.

4643615,5,B005B0QYMM,"When i first saw this preview, i thought it was going to be another Paranormal Activity rip off. but i had a little hope for it being an idie film. so when i saw that it had finally got a distributer to at least put it on demand, i had to check it out. i was very happy i did and i can't wait to buy it. it isn't a rip off of anything except the concept of found footage, yes, but it is done in a much better way. the begging is a parody on all the paranormal reality shows which is a great way to lighten the mood before you are thrusted into a hell for an hour and a half. the thrills are both anticipation and also things that jump out at you. it is better acting then i expected and the effects are very well done. this is how a horror movie should be, not shocking but scary and making you feel like you are there which makes you even more scared. i rarely get scared ever, but this one had me jumping.",1317427200,3,907,3.855614973262032

4643617,4,B005B0QYMM,Actually when I first started watching this film I thought it was going to be terrible. But after about half the way through there are plenty of scares and wicked beasts that a ghost hunting crew run into while investigating an old asylum. I cannot wait to see what the directors will put out next. Definitely worth a watch and it's a whole hell of a lot better than that paranormal activity crap.,1316736000,,397,4.4520547945205475

You put your guard down from the get go and thats what they wanted with the stupid, superficial aganishing dialougue. Then  once your guarrd is down and your laughing mad you wasted a few bucks. IT HITS YOU with EVRYTHING YOU WANT IN A HORROR SICK PLOT, GORY DETAILS, INTENSE PREMINITIONS AND HORROR, VIVID GHOSTS AND UNCOMFORTABLE TENSE DARKNESS WHERE YOU END UP FEELING LIKE YOUR WALKING WITH THEM IN A GROUP TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THEIR SHOULDER> AHHHH So surprised THIS IS MUCH BETTER AND MORE INTENSE WITH MORE FULLFILLING SCARES THEN ANY STUPID ""PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 1/or 2 (which up until seeing this i didn't think was completely horrible) THIS MORE IS A MUST I didn't want to be so scared but me and my brother were talking about this all night until i had to walk to my house alone.

4643621,1,B005B0QYMM,"*****may contain slight Spoilers*****I'm generally not a tough critic and I can take a movie for what it is supposed to be.  I thought the beginning of this started off great.  I enjoyed how they mocked all those paranormal ""reality"" shows.  It started off pretty creepy and it was the subtle things that were really intense, but then the movie just got stupid, rather than having interaction with creepy paranormal spirits it turned into your run of the mill low budged horror film. A builidng that mysteriously changed form and rearranged itself, night time lasting for several days....c'mon.....they took a good idea and a great begining and just crapped on the rest. By the end absolutely none of it was scary or creepy.",1315785600,4,724,4.869918699186992
4643622,3,B005B0QYMM,"I am a huge fan of horror movies and ghost stories. I watched this movie a total of 2 times. The first time I watched it, I couldn't tell if it was really a comedy, really bad acting, or a parody of Ghost Adventures. I think it might be a combination. After the first 20 minutes or so, it takes a turn and actually becomes quite scary. The CGI in this movie is not very good. The idea is very good though. It could have been a lot better. But if you are a fan of horror movies you should watch this to judge for yourself.",1315699200,,521,3.9245283018867925
4643623,4,B005B0QYMM,"Well, to be honest, I was sort of skeptical of this movie.  The beginning was a bit corny and cheesy.  And the intro of Lance on Grave Encounters show reminded me of Paranormal State intro with Ryan talking.  And a lot of the mannerisms Lance has seem to be from Ryan Buell.

Anyway, once you got out of the corniness, the movie really took you into the haunted bowels of the abandoned mental asylum.  For the reminder of the time, the movie had me on edge to be honest right to the very end.  Not many movies can do that to me but this one did.  I highly recommend it for anyone fond of paranormal type movies without the gory, slasher details.  Enjoy guys!",1315612800,49,658,4.25
4643624,5,B005B0QYMM,"Grave Encounters is much like the film Paranomral Activity, but has a different plot. It is just as scary and filmed from raw camera footage. There are many arguments throughout the public if Grave Encounters is real, based on a true story or all fiction. I can't see if I have a theory, but does it matter? People have been complaining because it isn't real. So what? Wheather it is or not, it's still a great film and worth the money. I'm not a friend of the film makers and I love it. Sorry, this other comment who hated it kind of made me mad enough to write that. This a good movie for people who loved and were scared to death by Paranormal Activity.",1315440000,25,656,4.256

8463835,4,B005B0QYMM,"Of found footage films released after Blair Witch, this is in the better half. The acting is much better than what I expect from B movie horror; while the writing leaves things to be desired sometimes, the actors are able to execute even clumsy dialogue well enough that its enjoyable. There is a reasonable premise - a tv crew filming in a haunted hospital - and the preface from the supposed executive producer of the show is actually one of the rather nicer touches.

The film does start out slowly. I enjoyed the careful little hints at the coming catastrophe, and was actually quite happy about the longish exposition, but it won't be for everyone. While this film isn't as slow as the lovely and atmospheric ""The Eyes of My Mother,"" it isn't nearly as fast paced as its found-footage-sibling [Rec]. (Nor quite as good as either film, but both are masterpieces in their own subgenres of horror).

If you're looking for absolute terror, this isn't really the right film for that either. Admittedly, as someone who doesn't scare easily, or at all, I'm not the best judge of this, but in the grand scheme of horror films, this isn't one that'll have you watching your back at night. Still, all in all, a lovely little found footage film that far exceeds expectations.",1527033600,,1269,4.686098654708521
8463836,2,B005B0QYMM,"...at least choose one that can act and doesn't perpetuate the stereotypical ""hothead black person who can't act but can yell expletives on command"". There are NO actors in this movie that are any good, and really none of the characters will make you give 2 cents to care to find out what happened to them. They're bad. BAD bad.

The fx are garbage, and the slow burn of a story takes too long for anything to really happen. I don't really mind found footage films and I can usually suspend belief to disregard how all the cameras are all the time in focus and framed perfectly, and how the batteries never seem to fade out, but this movie is just painful. Very painful.

A scare or two is here if you have the patience and can endure the horrific acting, but if not, def. skip it. You'll never care you missed it.",1527033600,,814,4.313725490196078

This is just a really well done horror flick, that is actually creative with its found footage atmosphere. It is a mocumentary about a doomed paranormal investigation show. I don't want to spoil anything with this movie, but suffice to say its really good at making a foreboding atmosphere and .showing a hopeless situation. I also really like the characters as well and actually care about their well being (a rarity in horror movies).

I've watched an awful lot of horror movies, especially of the found-footage variety, and they can be hit or miss.  This one was a pretty solid hit for me.  This movie does some pretty clever things regarding the haunting, but I won't spoil them here.

Personally, I don't believe in this stuff.  I'd *like* to, don't get me wrong.  I think it'd be crazy fun to haunt a house after I die and I'd totally go for that at least for a few hundred years if it's an option.  As a skeptic, I rather enjoy seeing a movie take shots at the reality TV industry, especially the paranormal investigation ""reality TV"" shows.  When I watch crap like Ghost Hunters, it blows my mind that anyone's actually gullible enough to believe that garbage.  It's all so obviously scripted and fake.  It's nice to see a movie with that industry in its sights.",1523145600,,932,4.494047619047619
