7921488,5,B00004RVXK,"""A performance totally faithful to the Gilbert & Sullivan Tradition"" says the cover, and this 1973 performance by the excellent D'Oyly Carte Opera Company is just that. Excellent staging, no unnecessary mincing or low comedy, and some terrific performances by all the main protagonists.

The great John Reed is magnificent as Sir Joseph Porter, KCB, and his rendition of the Admiral's song (""When I Was A Lad"") is right up there with the classic 1930 recording by Sir Henry Lytton.
Baritone Michael Rayner is dignified as captain Corcoran, and commanding bass baritone John Ayldon is excellent and even a little bit touching as the not-so-villainous Dick Deadeye.

Much better than the 1982 production starring Frankie Howard, this is the real deal. If you want to see ""Pinafore"" the way it was staged back in 1878, track down a copy of this video before it's too late!",1134259200,11,869,4.945205479452055
