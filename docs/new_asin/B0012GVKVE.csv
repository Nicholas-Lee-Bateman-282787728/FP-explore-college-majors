U Know! Damm 4 season not availbe. but three season's in the front seat. Ha Ha Ha  martin, martin, martin, Lawrence, How Ya Doin""",1202342400,2,378,4.323943661971831
3088983,5,B0012GVKVE,"This is the season I personally have been waiting for, it has some of the funniest episodes, and it does have my all time favorites. The episode when he's at the DMV getting his license. An absolute must have for all Martin fans. I bought Seasons 1,2, and 3 all @ midnight as soon as they hit the shelf in the stores. So you can believe I'm going to be in there when this one hits the shelf.",1200960000,3,391,4.0256410256410255
3088984,5,B0012GVKVE,"I am a diehard Martin Lawrence fan. Season Four doesn't have many of the best episodes of the 6 seasons, however, its the best season overall. I think that in seasons 1-3, Martin was still finding himself as an actor and exploring outside interest. In seasosn four, he got it and I believe his fans were hooked. It has one of my favorite episodes with the Notorious BIG. One of his few screen apprearances. The fourth season also has a slew of A-listers' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Adele Givens, Salt&Pepa, Halle Barry, Charles Barkley, Marla Gibbs, Tiny Lister, Sherman Hemsley and Chris Rock. I'm sure I missed some. If you are a diehard Martin fan, this is a no-brainer. If you are not; don't sleep. This is a comedic keeper. A must have for any cd collection.",1200873600,7,757,4.614814814814815
3088985,5,B0012GVKVE,oh yea im definitley goin out to the store to get this the day it come out. this is the season i have been waiting for. i have all 3 and can't wait to add this to my collection lol. im just anxious to hear the theme song.,1200528000,2,221,3.625

This show has been off the air for over 11 years and we STILL laugh at it, like it was just aired last week! It's funny watching him in character as Moma Payne and Shenenh because you don't even think of it being him as a woman as he played it so well! They were like ""real"" people. Anyone who is looking for guaranteed laughs get ALL seasons and you will be happy you did!",1233878400,2,469,4.164835164835165

3089168,5,B0012GVKVE,"I absolutely love Martin - the show and Martin himself.  This, to me, is the best season - each episode is hilarious and I really enjoy watching it.  I really love the fighting that goes on between Martin and Pam.  They act like kids but keep coming up with fantastic insults.
I love the episode Cole On Ice where Martin gets Charles Barkley to appear on his talkshow, yet Cole ruins it and Charles backs out.  There is even a special episode where Tisha Campbell hosts 'the best' of Martin throughout the beginning to the 100 episode.  There's also the one where it's Martins birthday and there is a video message to him from Halle Berry and Chris Rock.
I think this is finally the season for the real comedy to shine through without some of the sillyness that previous seasons had.  Now that I'm caught up on seasons 1-4, I'm hanging out for season 5 to be released.  Can't wait - this is a brilliant show.",1211673600,9,908,4.401197604790419

There are few 'misses' in this season just like last season but overall, this is one of his more better seasons.",1207526400,,382,4.632352941176471

Gina and Matin are married in this season and after that, their chemistry kinda took a nosedive. The best episodes from the season don't involve the main characters but from the supporting cast, Tommy, Pam, and Cole. This is a great gift idea so with that in mind, buy season 4 today!

3323481,5,B0012GVKVE,"I am a diehard Martin Lawrence fan. Season Four doesn't have many of the best episodes of the 6 seasons, however, its the best season overall. I think that in seasons 1-3, Martin was still finding himself as an actor and exploring outside interest. In seasosn four, he got it and I believe his fans were hooked. It has one of my favorite episodes with the Notorious BIG. One of his few screen apprearances. The fourth season also has a slew of A-listers' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Adele Givens, Salt&Pepa, Halle Barry, Charles Barkley, Marla Gibbs, Tiny Lister, Sherman Hemsley and Chris Rock. I'm sure I missed some. If you are a diehard Martin fan, this is a no-brainer. If you are not; don't sleep. This is a comedic keeper.

This show has been off the air for over 11 years and we STILL laugh at it, like it was just aired last week! It's funny watching him in character as Moma Payne and Shenenh because you don't even think of it being him as a woman as he played it so well! They were like ""real"" people. Anyone who is looking for guaranteed laughs get ALL seasons and you will be happy you did!",1233878400,2,469,4.164835164835165

3323665,5,B0012GVKVE,"I absolutely love Martin - the show and Martin himself.  This, to me, is the best season - each episode is hilarious and I really enjoy watching it.  I really love the fighting that goes on between Martin and Pam.  They act like kids but keep coming up with fantastic insults.
I love the episode Cole On Ice where Martin gets Charles Barkley to appear on his talkshow, yet Cole ruins it and Charles backs out.  There is even a special episode where Tisha Campbell hosts 'the best' of Martin throughout the beginning to the 100 episode.  There's also the one where it's Martins birthday and there is a video message to him from Halle Berry and Chris Rock.
I think this is finally the season for the real comedy to shine through without some of the sillyness that previous seasons had.  Now that I'm caught up on seasons 1-4, I'm hanging out for season 5 to be released.  Can't wait - this is a brilliant show.",1211673600,9,908,4.401197604790419

Gina and Matin are married in this season and after that, their chemistry kinda took a nosedive.
