189888,4,1572525509,This is a very amusing film with delightful performances of its stars (Peter Sellers- Sophia Loren)and nice second roles(De Sica-Graham Stark). Easy going film highly entertaining. Recommended!,939859200,8,193,6.185185185185185

189891,3,1572525509,"Great film, great direction, great actors and actresses (Sofia Loren is amazingly beautiful, and no wonder why Sellers fell in love with her) but this DVD ""release"" is worse than what you might find on YouTube or the public domain. HORRIBLE audio transfer. HORRIBLE video transfer - the distribution company - Fox Lorber - should be so ashamed. They didn't even bother to transfer the film from a decent video print.

I give ONE STAR to Fox Lorber and this HORRIBLE DVD, but FIVE stars for the story, the actors and fact that I at least have a copy of a film that SHOULD have been polished up for a true Blu-Ray version of it.",1459209600,3,626,4.443478260869565
189892,5,1572525509,"Maggie Smith amply demonstrates, in this production, why she is one of the greatest actors working today. With an impeccable handle on timing and delivery, she conveys effortlessly the imperious, infuriating, irresistible character of Epifania, the richest woman in England, who is ""humiliated"" by her ""poverty"" of 30 million pounds. Every little moment is infused with the Dame's absolute attention to her craft - such as her elegantly shaking fingers, clasping a slim cigarette, as she rains a torrent of highly amusing abuse on her bemused lawyer. The entire supporting cast is excellent. One quibble would be the slightly uneven sound quality, but even that lends a charm to this vintage production.
This film has aged like golden wine in a rich cask, and one can come back to it time and again to savor the cutting intelligence of the lines, or observe, in admiration, the majestic force contained in the slim frame of Dame Maggie Smith.

EDIT: I realise that there were quite a few negative reviews before mine. In my (personal) opinion, you would enjoy this film tremendously if you expect a terrific delivery of GB Shaw's play with top-notch actors, especially Maggie Smith in her prime. You might come away disappointed if you were expecting a high-budget ""movie""-type film, with a rapid plot or ""character development"" in a modern sense, where people ""grow"". However, if you are ready for a wonderful display of how the English language may be deliciously deployed by absolute masters (or mistresses), then do not for the world miss this.",1449878400,4,1548,5.023346303501945

Peter Sellers did another uncannily dead on imitation of an accent, to go with his many imitations of accents from England and America, and he got to read some actual GBS lines, which was nice.  There was more language from the George Bernard Shaw play than I had expected.  Dennis Price and Alistair Sim offer nice comic support.  I just wish they could have used an actress less concerned with how she looked and more interested in the language of the play.  Sophia Loren's performance almost ruined the film for me.",1425254400,,563,4.59

For me, this one is the shining star and deserved the big budget film treatment given to ""Travels,"" which did not go over with me.  Both were ""knock yourself out"" parts with an over-the-top type of woman.  Again, there is such a notable difference in Ms. Smith's portrayals.  In this one, she definitely exhibits the energy, but successfully I thought.  In ""Travels,"" the aplomb was a bomb.  I was actually embarrassed for her.  It was an era of wacky and outlandish characters and doings with, again, at least one high energy character.  For me, this production carried it off without chewing up the scenery.  Definitely interested in revisits here, but nevermore for the annoying ""Travels,"" Ms. Smith's painful parts included.  However, that one is a rare exception for the wonderfully versatile and capable star performer.  [Note: ""Millionairess"" is worth it just for the dual fur flaps in the face at the beginning. Indeed, NO ONE can assault a staircase like Epifania. :)]",1393372800,10,1169,4.974226804123711

A Millionaires go to a Barrister to make sure her prize fighter husband can not get any of her money because he is running around on her, can't divorce because of the scandal.

189960,1,1572525509,"Several years before the ""Pink Panther"" series began, Peter Sellers seems to have gone through a silly period.  This has to be one of his silliest films, making it a wonder how he could go on to such success with the ""Pink Panther,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and ""Being There.""

Movies, like anything else, are products of their time.  In 1960, when this film was produced, the Cold War was in full swing and economic recession gripped the U. S.  So humor may have been hard to come by, or at least, that's what I'm trying to tell myself.  For this story to be based on the writing of Geo. Bernard Shaw, the Irish Marxist, an edge of irony might be expected.  But, instead, what we get is a hopeless mishmash that is really not funny, ironic, or anything in between.

Comparing this film with the 1972 production of the same name, starring Maggie Smith, is hopeless.  At least that movie has the witty dialogue and social edge one would expect of Shaw.  The Peter Sellers-Sophia Loren version has almost none of that.  It is just plain silly and a waste of time.

Giving this film one star is extremely generous.  It has to be one of the poorest movies since Peter Ustinov tried to play Charlie Chan.  Bad, bad, bad.",1328832000,,1209,4.465753424657534

Maggie must have been desperate for employment to have taken on such a shabby, tasteless, idiotic, inane show as this. It has the hollow, one room approach you might see in a stage play but no sane person would be able to watch this terrible show from start to finish.

It is so bad, the DVD is not even useful as a cup coaster.

I have thousands of movies in my collection and this one rates with the bottom 3 worst movies imaginable... which are not even worthwhile of being listed as part of the collection. Perhaps the British can tolerate this tripe but I don't know of too many on this side of the pond who could.

The instructor, who only married her for money runs off with another woman and Sophia is forced to take a look at herself and determine why, if she had so much more to offer her husband, did he up and choose someone else? She then contemplates suicide and it's upon trying to commit suicide that she meets Peter Sellers. Sellers plays a doctor in England of Indian descent who is devoted to helping the providing and treating the poor.
Sophia wants to build him a clinic with every modern convenience but the poor feel when they go there they're treated like another number. They even have to answer stupid questions like ""sex"". They feel the doctor should be able to take one good look and know whether they're male or female.
Sophia falls in love with this doctor who is unimpressed by her money and they make a bet ....she gives him $500 Lbs. He gives her 39 shillings.....within 3 months they are to meet again and find out what they did with their money. This seems to be the only way that either of them can determine if the other is actually worthy. I cannot imagine any man turning down a marriage proposal from Sofia Loren. I know I certainly would not. I have read the reviews and discovered that the American print is not good. I have the British version which is a region 2. It is a beautiful print of the film. The film appears to be just made and released. Sophia is absolutely breathtaking and Sellers proves he can be comical or dramatic. This movie has it's humor but also has life lessons within it's plot.
The great Vittorio Di Sica is on hand as a man who is running a sweat shop that makes pasta and within 3 months Sophia converts him into a very rich man. It seems the millionairess learned from her dad how to make money and she has a natural knack for doing that to every one. It's Sellers who is unimpressed about her financial status that drives her desire even more about getting him. It's a wonderful movie. I'm sorry others did not get to enjoy it.

The direction and sets are very stage-like as opposed to a TV or cinema movie.
This would be more enjoyable for Shaw, literature, or theater fans than your average public.  Maggie Smith does a fantastic job.  The rest of the cast is excellent. I haven't read the play so I don't know if anything was changed.  The first time I tried watching it, I fell asleep several times.

189976,2,1572525509,"""The Milionairess"" is a stage play that did not translate well onto the silver screen.  The filming was done many years ago and the acting is ""over-the-top"" to the point of haming-it-up.  The story line is good, but presented in a somewhat hysterical and at times almost frenzied style.  As a stage play it would have been good, but as a film, I do not recommend unless you are interested in the history of theatre and acting.  I do not think G.B. Shaw would have been pleased with this production.  The typical British humour seems lost in the frenzy of the acting.",1207699200,3,566,4.509803921568627

Maggie Smith is a brilliant actress but even she couldn't save it.",1195603200,12,385,4.026315789473684

Dame Maggie Smith is absolutely perfect as Epifania and, as expected, steals the show and runs away with it. The rest of the cast is perfect as well, with the possible exception of Charles Gray as Adrian, who didn't really fulfil my expectations of the character.",1185667200,37,450,4.8311688311688314

impermissible bad language in modern films, it's nice to go back to someone who knows how to use language. eg. George Bernard Shaw.  This movie was done (poorly) with Sophia Loren and

Peter Sellers...but I adored the play with Maggie Smith.  Oh...how she dominates her role.  At once, we understand how magnificent a star she is.  She plays the richest woman in England who is obsessed with getting what she wants, and having the cash to do it.  She is beautiful and arrogant yet brilliant in the ways of capitalism.  When she is given the challenge of

getting a job and supporting herself without her wealth, well,

she can do it because she understands money.  Indeed she walks into businesses and transforms them into profitable enterprises. Whether the impact of her changes hurts the poor or middle class is of no concern to her...profitability is the key.  This is a wonderful production and is a MUST for any Maggie Smith fan.",1156291200,149,997,4.732558139534884

OH Those GORGEOUS Clothes!  Yes there are many historical films out there with tremendous costuming (Anna and the King, GWTW, The Ten Commandments, etc.) but for a non-historical film showing contemporary clothing this is simply the best.  Don't get me wrong, I am awed by Adrian, and enjoy watching Edith Head's designs come alive on screen but this is the best film for costuming and clothing EVER.

Yes, yes it's not a reason for a film buff to buy it.  But if you're studying fashion design, or are a clothing historian or just want to kick back one night and fill your head with scrumptious eye candy, this is it.",1148428800,15,880,4.3496932515337425

I give this film a pass because of the appealing performances by the film's leads, Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren.  Sellers gives a terrific low-key turn as the sweet humanistic doctor.  Loren is earthy yet manages to humanize the spoiled heiress she plays.  As written, her character comes of as unappealing but Loren manages to engender empathy.  Good supporting cast that includes Alistair Sim as Loren's barrister, Vittorio De Sica as a sweat shop owner, and Dennis Price(""Kind Hearts and Coronets"") as Loren's psychiatrist.  Stanley Kubrick fans should note the presence of Miriam Karlin(the catwoman in ""A Clockwork Orange"") as De Sica's wife.",1128988800,3,808,5.2578125

189985,4,1572525509,"Nobody seems to have reviewed this film for the last 5 years, so here goes. This play is a curious hybrid: a blunt political and satirical message promoted via haute couture, the uniquely gorgeous Loren, and the hyper-talented Peter Sellers. There are also a large number of very able English character actors, as well as the charismatic Vittorio de Sica. I thought the role of Corelli, played by someone called Charles Hill, was actually played by Alfred Marks --- perhaps he used an alias. Derek Nimmo popped up, uncredited. It IS slow-paced, as one reviewer has remarked, but it does hold the interest, as another also noted. Difficult to say why. It's very stagy. In fact, I'm virtually certain it's based on a play by George Bernard Shaw, hence the political paradoxes. Did Mankowitz supply the extra dollop of Marxism? I thought it was also well-known that Sellers and Loren ignited like glue on the set; and perhaps this gives it such a strong undercurrent of non-explicit sensuality, intensifying the voyeuristic sensation. Well, all that equipment really is a treat. The ending is flat and very weak: it just fizzles out into nothing much, as though the script-writer simply couldn't think of a neat way of wrapping up the loose threads. Not exactly four-star, but better than Saving Private Ryan.",1111017600,17,1306,4.9409090909090905
