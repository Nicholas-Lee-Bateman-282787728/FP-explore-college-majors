6487976,5,B00LIUIFGM,"I saw Ian Anderson in 1971 when Tull had just released Aqualung. Watching him perform TAB/2 in Iceland reminded me that Mr. Anderson still has that edge to him on stage that he had in 1971. TAB2 is not as raw as TAB but his approach to telling us a story with stage mime and background video rather than simply performing before a audience is a major step forward in music video art. The backing musicians are top notch making this performance a real treat for long time fans. Who else would admit they gave up trying to play guitar on stage after watching Eric Clapton. Ian Anderson knows his strengths and this Blu-Ray is the real concept album critics years ago tried to call Aqualung. If you are a Tull / Ian Anderson fan, get your hands on this performance!",1412380800,,762,4.411347517730497

6487982,5,B00LIUIFGM,"On the evening of June 11, 1972 I saw Jethro Tull perform Thick as a Brick and it was my favorite concert of all time. The band - Martin Barre, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, Barriemore Barlow, John Evans and maestro Ian Anderson were then at a creative peak;  what separated them the most from their progressive rock contemporaries was that , while superb musicians Tull never took themselves seriously and brought a wonderfully clever sense of humor to the stage. Their performance was like a flying circus weaving hilarious skits (based around the TAAB newspaper) into the musical performance  a blend of acoustic melody and virtuosic hard rock.  I have never seen a band rock that hard! I attended a Rolling Stones concert the week before and Led Zeppelin the week after, and while I felt both of those performances were great, they paled in comparison to Tull.  Sadly, all that remains from that amazing 1972 TAAB tour are dimming memories, grainy, silent 8mm film clips and audience recorded bootlegs.
Skip ahead 40 years.  Ian Anderson creates TAAB 2 and goes on tour to perform both the original and TAAB2 in their entirety. The concert in Reykjavik in July 2012 was filmed and featured in this Blu-ray DVD.
My review is of the 2012 performance of the original TAAB only.
How does it compare to the 1972 concert? First and foremost, as one would expect, it is necessarily far more subdued.  In his mid-60s, Ian Anderson the whirling dervish is long gone, no more leaping across the stage or bending backwards nearly to the floor, and his voice has deteriorated to the extent that he really struggles to sing much of the material (wisely, he has brought in Ryan ODonnell to fill in on the more difficult vocal parts). Gone too are all of the crazy 1972 Tull band members, the extended solos, the volume, the strobe lights ,the frogman, the wild hair and beards!
It makes one wonder, why would Ian Anderson even try to recreate the magic 40 years later?
The answer is, he knows he cant.  But he is still able to produce a very faithful and well played -  if kinder and gentler - rendition of TAAB. I must say that guitarist extraordinaire Martin Lancelot Barre is sorely missed, his fiery blues intensity cannot be recreated by young Florian Opahle, yet he and his band mates are fine musicians who seem inspired by the music and play even the difficult passages perfectly and with passion.  TAAB is such a wonderful, adventurous and diverse piece of music that one cant help but be drawn into this fine performance.
At the end of side 1 of the 1972 concert, there was an absurd on-stage news and weather report, 40 years later it is replaced by a skit about prostrate exams, an age appropriate awareness piece that also gets a good laugh.
The sight and sound on this Blu-ray are first rate, I would think that any Tull fan would thoroughly enjoy the concert (at least the original TAAB performance) and maybe win some new fans as well.",1409702400,23,2936,4.663442940038685
6487983,5,B00LIUIFGM,"I had the pleasure of seeing this tour live and it was fantastic. It's great to have a wonderfully-recorded souvenir of the experience. For the dolts below who are complaining ""why is it Thick as a Brick over and over?""... 2012 was the 40th anniversary of the original ""Thick as a Brick"" album, so Ian Anderson released ""Thick as a Brick 2"" (a completely different album), and then went on the road playing both Thick as a Bricks in concert.  It was the first time if 40 years that the original TAAB was performed in its entirety. Sounds and looks great on my system. Great stuff.",1409443200,6,580,4.471698113207547
6487984,3,B00LIUIFGM,"Normally I would rank anything by Ian Anderson with five stars as a devoted and ravenous fan. While the filming is fantastic, and the music glorious, there are strange interruptions that I can only imagine are a spin off idea of ""The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles"". It's not so much the these interludes are bizarre in themselves but it's the placement, you are suddenly slammed out of the concert and left wondering ""What is going on?"" When the music starts again you're still disoriented from Ian's cell phone call and the various other pauses and it takes a few minutes to fall back into the performance.
This is well worth owning but as a viewer be braced for the stoppages.",1409356800,13,677,4.603305785123967
6487985,4,B00LIUIFGM,"This is standard definition video, upscaled to 1080i for Blu-ray. No deception, it says so right on the box. It looks... OK. As good as upscaled SD video is likely to look. You won't be using this disc to show off your HD projection system.

The audio is... OK. It's full-range, dynamic, uncompressed DTS-MA audio, but the mix is not great. The drums are consistently a bit too hot; the lead guitar usually buried; lead vocals (particularly Anderson's) a bit too up-front. Not well blended, very dry, very little house sound (audience or room ambiance). Sounds a lot like a sound-board mix.

The LPCM 2.0 mix, IMO, fares better, and I think its a different mix, not just a fold-down of the 5.1 version. It's not radically different, just more cohesive.

I loved the show when I saw it last year in Philadelphia, and this is pretty much the same show from earlier in the tour. Anderson's vocal issues are well-known, and I think his solution -- to include a ""vocal avatar"" in the band to carry part of the load, to act as a visual foil, and add some theatrical dimension to the narrative -- is brilliant.

When you listen to recent Anderson recordings, like TaaB2 or the recent Homo Erraticus, his vocal limitations are less evident. He still sounds like himself, and he writes for the voice he has now. You hear what's there, and it sounds fine. It's only when he tries to recreate performances from long ago that it becomes clear how seriously constrained his singing is. Thus, adding the young actor Ryan O'Donnell to the ensemble provides a very acceptable workaround, with the bonus that Anderson can play flute (with undiminished virtuosity) during vocals that were overdubbed in the original, and omitted or handed off to the keyboards during performances during the 70s.

The rest of the band does a fine job of being the world's top Jethro Tull cover band during TaaB. These are the first live performances of TaaB2, of course, and I think there's a little more spark in the second half of the show. (As an aside, I was absolutely appalled by the great number of people who abandoned the Philadelphia show at the break. Apparently, they just wanted to hear the familiar, with no interest in the new. Cretins, I say. Philistines.)

These shows are fun to watch. Anderson's energy and antics are barely attenuated from his glory days. The multimedia and theatrical elements are worthwhile enhancements. The old music is as compelling as it ever was; the new music is a worthy sequel, original in its own right yet clearly related, that also expands on the original narrative themes in relevant ways.

Whatever encores may have been performed (they did ""Locomotive Breath"" and one other song in Philly, IIRC) are not included here. But at 114 minutes for the main concert, plus some bonus material, it's a full program. (Interestingly, the bonus material includes additional performances -- at Montreux -- of two of the TaaB2 songs, and these *are* in HD video. Don't watch them before watching the main concert if you don't want to see just how much better the HD looks. The audio mixes -- stereo only -- are better, too, IMO.)

Bottom line: If you caught the tour, you'll want this. If you're a fan but missed the tour, you'll want this. If your main interest in Blu-ray concerts is in great audio and video quality, look elsewhere.",1409097600,65,3339,4.725085910652921

6487996,3,B00LIUIFGM,"Ian Anderson has been in Iceland for 9 shows, mostly in Reykjavik where this show was recorded. The
musician feel the presence of music here, because a lot of people plays an instrument or sings. Here
on this concert, the band took the same instruments to recreate the first concept album ""Thick as A
Brick"", originally from 1972. The performance has some additional theatrical input with actor,
singer and dancer Ryan O'Donnell which allowed Ian Anderson to add some more flute to the music.
Even is this album is a kind of parody, I was surprised to see Ian invite 2 peoples from the
audience to make a standup comic stunt of a fake prostate test. But it didn't last long before the
band were back to the music. The performance of this concept album let some space for a bit of
improvisation and some added violin and flute. After 40 years, it's still a enjoyable piece of music
where some theme are repeated a few times during this 50 minutes to keep the concept alive. As for
the second part of the show ""Thick As A Brick 2"", if it's the suite of this concept about this young
boy, it's different because we feel that each songs are independent to each others, the concept
being to present 5 hypothetical stories around this boy. You can only identify a connection
musically with the first album,  when some short segments of this album have been included to the
second album. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same magic here that I found on the first album.",1429142400,,1462,4.537878787878788

6488002,5,B00LIUIFGM,"I saw Jethro Tull in 1973 (if I remember correctly, I was much younger then!) at the LSU Assembly Center where they not only performed most of the Aqualung album, but they also performed a one hour rendition of Thick As A Brick (including solos).  It was an amazing performance.  Fast forward to 2013 and when I heard that Ian Anderson was coming to Houston to perform Thick As A Brick (original and 2), my wife and I HAD to go.  Forty years later, Ian Anderson & company did not disappoint.  Another amazing performance.  Okay, I suppose I'm not reviewing the DVD, but I will surely be buying it and enjoying it for years to come.  The only thing I will miss is seeing NASA astronaut Cady Coleman joining the band on stage to add her flute to the encore of Locomotive Breath, reprising her duet with Anderson when she was on the ISS and he, of course, was on the ground.

The presentation was theatrical and there was an additional member of the band to do mime, dancing, and singing. along with much multi-media.  They played the complete 'Thick As a Brick', took a short break, and came back for the newly released 'Thick As a Brick 2'.  Both the musicianship and presentation were impeccable, and this Blu-ray reflects that with a  robust 5.1 audio mix and enough camera angles to make the visuals interesting.

My only complaint is that there were about 45 minutes of additional material as an encore - classic Tull stuff, as you can imagine - that left the audience on its feet.  For some reason that was not included, and is the only fault that I can find with the entire package.  There are some bonus features, most especially a short interview with Ian Anderson, who in his later years has become more favorable in his views of the early Jethro Tull material, as well as a short piece about Iceland.

8666147,4,B00LIUIFGM,"I had a chance to see this concert tour but was worried I would be disappointed, so I didn't go.  After seeing this CD, I wish I did.

I saw Jethro Tull during the original 1972 Thick As A Brick tour.  It blew me away.  It is my gold standard for concerts and few have stacked up.
They played Thick As A Brick for an hour and fifteen minutes.  About 15 minutes of that was theatrical skits, including a news skit.  The rest was hard driving music.  In addition to great guitar and flute solos, there was amazing keyboard work exploding off of the speakers.  They also did the best version of Locomotive Breath with Wind Up wrapped around it.

So, after hearing Thick As A Brick 2, I was afraid this concert would be disappointing, especially without Martin Barre and John Evans and with Ian Anderson's voice failing.  And, I was right....the version of Thick of a Brick 1 is nowhere as good as that original tour.  There is none of that great keyboard work or those long flute solos.  But, it is still pretty good.

The surprise here is how good Thick as a Brick 2 is done live.  It is so much better than the studio version.

The sound quality and video on this DVD is very good....better than most DVD concerts.  You don't get that constant pan and scan and zooming in and out like most videos.  The camera is focused on the right person at the right time.

Maybe I should give this 5 stars, but I am not because I know this could have been so much better.

This Blu-ray forced me to run out and buy a new player.  I hardly play Blu-rays and used my player mostly for playing CDs.  But, when I put this in the player, it wouldn't play.  After trying a few more Blu-rays, I realized that the Blu-ray laser burned out and that there must be a separate laser for CDs....which makes sense, since they need a higher frequency laser for the higher resolution on a Blu-ray.",1514764800,,1868,4.292263610315186

BUT it really irks me that not only did HE ""sing"" too much - but there were many parts where they should have both been singing! Parts where Ian overdubbed his voice on the original recording. I just don't agree with the way the additional singer was used.
Plus Ian seemed to do much better when he recited some lyrics in a baritone instead of trying to sing them. That, he should have done more often.
All that being said, the music is so good it would have been worth it even if it was all instrumental.
On Thick 2, I like that main musical theme that's in ""Banker Bets"" and shows up again in a couple of other songs. And I noticed the Aqualung riff used once.
All in all, this is really good (albeit at the usual low volume that plagues most of Anderson/Tull's DVDs), but with a few tweaks could've been even better.",1513296000,,923,4.435294117647059

8666150,5,B00LIUIFGM,"Everyone on a Jethro Tull group on facebook always talk about how Ian has lost his voice in the last 15 or so years. I can take him singing anyway he wants. This guy has put so much in his life and the life of his undying fans. On this DVD he and his band (and I can listen to them as well as any past incarnations of Tull and even more easily than some of the newer ones) perform Thick as a Brick in its entirety. Ian has a vocal ""assistant"" and it works well for him and for me. Give Ian a break he is almost 70 if he is not already. Pretty spry guy and most of you that have been following him and Tull since the 70's or 80's, what about your hearing? You get the point. Anyway TAAB was performed good and a lot of attention to detail. Did it sound JUST like the original album? No and never does it with any song or any group but TAAB was a great offering to get the crowd ready for TAAB2.

TAAB2 was very good I thought. Ian wrote it with the voice he has now so was much more comfortable belting out the notes. I also found this on Homo Erraticus which I am also very glad I bought. Songs such as ""Banker Bets, Banker Wins and just about every other song, are performed with very good performances, musicianship and stage personality by everyone up there. In fact this is the most Tull I have ever heard this bunch since the original TAAB.

The prostrate exam was a suprise and kind of comedy and kind of serious is how I took it. The icelanders probably didn't know what to think as I liken them to reserved Canadians in the humor category. Anyway if you are a Tull fan and especially from way back, I think you will enjoy this as I have. Highly recommend this and I will be watching it again.........and probably buy the studio album TAAB2!",1489017600,,1748,4.093294460641399
8666151,4,B00LIUIFGM,"Musically very good. An aging Ian Anderson is not as animated as the young one I saw several times in the early 70's. Watch it once for the full experience, then on subsequent playings just close your eyes and enjoy the music.",1462838400,2,226,4.404761904761905
8666152,3,B00LIUIFGM,"Sound/video quality are good, but I wasn't much of a fan of Anderson's performance. I didn't hate it, it was amusing, but overall the concert was too stripped down, too many interruptions to the music, and not enough energy for my taste.",1457740800,,237,4.666666666666667
