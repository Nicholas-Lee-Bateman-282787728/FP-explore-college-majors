8223485,5,B000WHW4R8,"I got this some times back from marina books. It's a all pal dvd version from a russian distributer. You can shut off the poor russian dubbing and subittles for german language through guessing. This is an excellent musical that was made from the nazi period of 1944. Shot in glorious  agfa color. This was Marika Rokks last film for world war 2 and her second color feature. The story, her theatrical director is over working her in the theater and won't give her a vacation so she takes off and ends up stranded at a heimet village only to be rescued by walter muller and wolfgang luckshy. She teases them both but falls for wolf and keeps her status a secret. But when she finds out wolf sees show biz people as lazy she keeps it to herself. Wonderuf musicals numbers for that nazi period. No propaganda Her second come back ""Der kin donau"", 1950, would be her first color feature since 1944. Unfortunatley ther hasn't been a demand or it on dvd.",1233964800,,949,4.454022988505747
