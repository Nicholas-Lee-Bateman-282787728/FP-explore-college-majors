8376633,5,B002P59IDS,These videos were a great help to me.  I enjoyed examining the evidence for myself as a graduate in mathematics.  These films leave out the extreme bias of right wing religeous groups and left wing Darwinian groups.  I was very impressed with the evidence as it lies.  I recommend these films to anyone who wishes to filter out the angry mob of extremest groups and is seeking the facts to speak simply for themselves.,1260576000,2,418,4.608108108108108
8376634,5,B002P59IDS,"Former Stanford University developmental cell biologist researcher Dr. Bruce Lipton revealed how DNA is NOT the brain of the cell, rather the membrane is the conscious, self-regulatory ""intelligent design"" mechanism that interacts with the environment to manufacture living systems to carry the experience of life, as clearly put forth in his international bestseller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Biology-of-Belief-Unleashing-the-Power-of-Consciousness-Matter-Miracles/dp/1401923119/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter, & Miracles</a>&nbsp;and now&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spontaneous-Evolution-Our-Positive-Future-and-a-Way-to-Get-There-from-Here/dp/1401925804/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spontaneous Evolution: Our Positive Future (and a Way to Get There from Here)</a>. That is, it is NOT the case that Charlie Darwin made in the 1859 textbook On the Origin of Species for the ""natural selection of random mutations"" driving the engine of evolution. Again creation is a communication pathway for information, or, what I would call today the genetic expression of the zero-point field.

Indeed, even the hypothesis that nature is somehow a ""dead ghost in a machine"" is itself bankrupt: dead and gone from discussions by quantum physicists.

Ironically, it seems only in the so-called ""life sciences"" are we still digging up bones and having these post-mortem debates ad nauseum. Yes, it is ironic but then there is a lot of vested interests burning at the stake here: careers, egos, money. For once we finally grasp THE BIG IDEA that we are co-creators of reality, not mindless robots in skin suits, then we must likewise acknowledge that we can in fact self-heal our community of cells, and where would that leave Big Pharma and the medics? I mean the parasites that prey on the meme that nature is our enemy, ""red in tooth and claw"" and a breeding ground for dis-ease of all sorts?

Perhaps, we have met the enemy and they are us: Maybe it is our belief systems that need healing first and foremost?

In truth, what we have here in this propaganda war waged by closed-mind atheists wielding a peer-reviewed iron-tipped pen is in fact a belief system that creation has no purpose, our lives have no meaning, that life, liberty and pursuit of happiness is not possible. Upon those tenets I totally agree UNLESS we shift our paradigm to include Intelligent Design -- not creationism. (Creationism is NOT what these DVDs are portraying or even suggesting is valid.)

By all means, look at both sides of the issue but, for me, I have spent my lifetime searching for these answers in and out of the hallowed halls of major universities and minor colleges. My conclusion is crystal-clear: God is the Intelligent Designer of the heavens and earths (yes, we are not alone in the cosmos as I convey in my own writings and for that I make no apology either).

In summary, I have watched these DVDs and they are OUTSTANDING: They are of superb quality in graphics, vocal narration, as well as academic scholarship and balanced in presentation too. What more could you ask for to arm yourself in a complex spiritual debate topic but factual, hard-hitting science-based information?

Give me the fat-head free diet of data: I can follow the undoctored facts to the truth!

8376635,1,B002P59IDS,"If you didn't already know, it is about time you found out the truth...

Hard-core extremist right wing religious groups known as ""creationists"", and their spin-offs (next gen) called ""young creationists"" made up their own pseudo-theories [pseudo (Greek) = false] about evolution of life on earth and creation of the universe, they aptly named ""Intelligent Design""(a.k.a. ID) [sic].
Their only purpose is to convince everybody [better said ""brainwash""] that the real science [is there any other kind? ;)] is wrong about evolutionary biology [is there any other kind? ;)] and about the big bang theory [is there any other? ;)], and to persuade us to teach + learn their ""alternative theories"" [a.k.a. false science combined with divine intervention by ""the creator""] in public schools and to spread their word to anyone willing to listen.
Truth be told, the less educated among us are usually prone to fall for such a scam.
The creationists' grand plan is to transform ""Intelligent Design"" (ID) into official school curriculum, *if* we allow them to, by replacing science with ID. Lucky us, so far, public schools' boards of education members have not been lured into falling for this scheme, and fortunately for our children's sake, evolutionary biology is still taught as the only scientific theory, as it should.

Conclusion...
Go to school/college/university, pay attention, do your homework and strive for the best grades, because a good education equals the ultimate power and happiness.
Become knowledgeable by performing your own research, in order to properly inform yourself and express an educated opinion.
