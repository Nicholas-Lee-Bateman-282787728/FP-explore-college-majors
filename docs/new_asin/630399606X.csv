And it's a topic that I want to know more about and yet, as widespread, as important to people as it is, lightning is not well understood even to this day.  It's good to see that there's been research done on it.

This episode is 20 years old and yet is anything but outdated -- many of the things they were researching then are still poorly understood even today.

Here we get to see several researchers trying to capture lightning and get it to give up its secrets.  Nova tries to show us lightning from all angles:  people and airplanes getting struck, how it affects them, and how to avoid/survive a strike.  There is also a little bit of history of how lightning has been studied since the time of Ben Franklin. They talk to the researchers and show artifacts from lightning strikes, discuss instances where lightning has knocked out power for days and how vulnerable our power grid is.

Why is lightning so hard to study?  It's relatively easy to photograph, but to get outstanding photographs, especially those that can help us learn its secrets, is much more difficult.  Modern photography helps a good deal, for lightning is fast, surprisingly unpredictable, and it takes some luck and a camera that can capture multiple images in a second's time to show all the various strokes -- it's not just one bolt, it's a bunch of them.

Even though we've all seen plenty of lightning, getting it to perform when your camera and various instruments are in place and ready is as much a matter of luck as skill.  Here they show experiments that use rockets to trigger a lightning strike so they can get them to strike in a place and in a way that they can measure them better.

And they do succeed, a little at a time, getting it to reveal a little more about itself.

This Nova episode is anything but out of date, but I would very much like to see them do another one (or two or three, for that matter).

Overall it's very entertaining and educational:  highly recommended!",1438128000,,2041,4.490514905149052
7858203,5,630399606X,"I love to watch this episode every so often. Would love to see if they could do an HD transfer with some HQ sound. Easiest to just watch during a storm though and hope the power doesn't go out! 20 years old but still a great episode. Wonder how everyone they interviewed is doing with their research these days? I have begun to take pictures of lightning with my Canon SX120IS using the CHDK software you can find on the internet and there are some tidbits of information in this episode about how others do the same. But it is neat to see how some of the experimenters mess around with trying to draw a lightning strike. Also gotta get me a fulgurite (would love to find one but I may just buy one), they look really cool!",1410566400,,723,4.246376811594203

7858207,3,630399606X,"This was a good lightning doco.  I thought there would be a lot more shots of lightning in the sky and I was disappointed that there wasn't more.  I wanted video shots of lightning to use in a personal video project totalling 6 minutes.  There wasn't 6 minutes of video lighting ( out of over 50 minutes documentary time) in the Doco.  Still, it was a good documentary.  I'll go to UTUBE now that I have discovered it.",1231718400,5,418,4.3076923076923075
7858208,5,630399606X,"Along with National Geographic, Nova consistently produces the best science programs on the market.  In addition to the more current ""Hunt for the Supertwister"" (also from Nova), this is a fascinating look at one of nature's most beautiful yet frightening phenomenon.  Not only does the program explain the hows and whys of lightning but it also goes along with a number of scientists to follow their research into the nature and genesis of lightning.  Of particular note are the scientists in Florida and New Mexico who fire rockets into the heart of a thunderstorm in an effort to ""capture"" nature's electical fireworks. Fascinating footage that always gets the attention of my students  Great program for educational use as well as the general public.  Fine narration by Al Roker, who also did the excellent PBS series ""Savage Skies"" Highly recommended.",1123804800,21,856,5.129496402877698
7858209,5,630399606X,"This is the video.  If you want to see the cutting edge research, this is the video.  If you want to see how little we really know about lightning , this is the video.  If you want to teach a class (I teach High School Science) about lightning this is the video.",1115078400,3,262,4.0
