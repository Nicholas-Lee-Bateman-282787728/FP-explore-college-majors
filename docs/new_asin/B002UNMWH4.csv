8381326,5,B002UNMWH4,"interesting idea. 3 experts talk about a game as it's being played. i think it would of been better if the game had already been played and on tape, because ,the experts could of gone more indepth on each hand. as it was, they had to get their comment out ""too"" quickly before the next hand was finished. several times sklanky would be trying to make a point and was basicly ""shhhhed"" by the host. although they never argued, ""mike the mouth"" {more of a loose aggressive player} and david sklanky {tight aggressive} would dis-agree at times. the host had to stop slansky and the mouth from taking sometimes so bruson could {would have to} talk. i was very interested in some of ""mike the mouths"" comments. there really isn't that much in print on the more ""loose aggressive"" styles of poker. i enjoyed seeing and hearing david sklansky talk. i've read most of his books and in my minds ear he always sounds a liitle ""gruf"". and the back photo's of him and mason malmuth make them look like a couple of ""hit men"" or ""serial killers"". he came off ""almost"" normal.{just kidding}.",1261008000,6,1076,4.551546391752577
