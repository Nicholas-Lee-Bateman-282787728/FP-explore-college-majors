2548191,3,B000F1IO3O,"I'll start off by saying I give Sara a lot of credit for being totally original. A lot of comics these days just recycle jokes other comdians have said a thousand times before. The movie ""Jesus Is Magic"" was at times hilarious,shocking and a snoozefest. I lmao at the parts about her Nana,her favorite niece,role models and porn. However the opening segment where she talks about Jesus and the Martin Luther King segment made me cringe a bit. Although after replaying the MLK segment it was funnier that I thought it was originally.

  I would recommend this movie to people who are not offended by ethnic jokes that can come off as racist even though she probably just does it for shock value. The movie slows down considerably during the song segments. I read so much about her being ""cutting edge"" I was a little dissapointed overall. I think she can be a lot funnier than this movie shows and hopefully next time around she will use less race related jokes. The ""chink"" jokes and the bit about the starving kids seen on tv infomercials being 9 months pregnant and her not sending them money because she didn't want them to use it for drugs were in very bad taste in my opinion.",1149984000,,1181,4.535211267605634
2548192,1,B000F1IO3O,"I normally don't write reviews for entertainment products.  I'm writing this because I feel snookered by the advertising that indicated that, if you like Wanda Sykes, you'll also want to see this video.  I like Wanda Sykes.... and, in fact, I like a lot of harsh comedians too... like Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Prior, Sam Kennison, Chris Rock.  I don't mind being shocked by comedy.  A common thread for the ones I've just mentioned is that I could always relate to their humanity, even when they were doing their best to provoke me into thinking about their point.  Sarah Silverman reminds more of Andrew Dice Clay.  I've never been able to relate to him as a person. His experience base is just too far from mine, and he just doesn't know when its funny, and when its pathetic.

Sarah doesn't understand this line either.  Her skits and stand up routines suggest to me that maybe she was abused as a child - if not physically, then mentally.  If the goal of the video is to make me feel sorry for her, then the video works.

Frankly, I thought it was a waste of time, and a waste of money. This is the only comedy DVD that I've ever bought that I'm planning to sell.",1149897600,11,1178,4.437209302325582
2548193,1,B000F1IO3O,"This was one of the worst comedy concerts I've ever seen.  I heard from alot of people that this was great and hilarious.  So, I went out and rented it(thank god, I didn't buy it).  I think I laughed once....about the birth control joke.  Another reason i didn't like this is because I got sick of her being so, self-centered, selfish, and conceited.  Everything was about Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.  I think she mentioned her boyfriend once.  This is not edgy, or provocative, or racial.  This is a poor attempt to ""shock"" the audience.  Do yourself a favor, if you want to watch a great, edgy, provocative comic.  Watch Bill Hicks.",1149811200,10,627,4.618181818181818
2548194,3,B000F1IO3O,"i cannot endorse another reviewer's wish for a comedy album of sarah's songs.  i wasn't sure what to expect from this DVD, but i was eager to try it.  however, as soon as the opening menu began, playing her opening ""song"" as a background, i was instantly terrified that the ""brilliant"" comedy i was promised by a few trusted friends would not be delivered. luckily, within five minutes or so we the viewer are ushered into a theatre where sarah is giving her live stand-up routine without any bells and whistles.  it is here that i was able to enjoy some of the heralded ""brilliance"" i was told of.  i did not enjoy the several ""songs"" which were interspersed throughout the film at all, but i can attest that sarah's stand-up is a must see for fans of unique and creative stage comedy.

what is so good about the comedy is sarah's cadence and manner, and what is so bad about the songs is that they don't capture either of those things.  the songs are more of a twenty-first century wierd-al yankovic kind of half-baked lampoonery.  they are not half as interesting as her stand-up work.

sarah's stand-up style works in an odd way.  sarah delivers her show in, i believe, ""character"". at least i really hope it is in character.  this ""character"" is a sort of neurotic, but narcissistic american princess.  she is abrasive in the extreme, though in a vigilantly self-conscious way.  it works well because much of the ""hateful"" content is spewed with meta-caveats, sort of unapologetic acknowlegements of her american ignorances.  she strikes me as clever in this way, because i feel that ""qualifying"" predjudices is an unfortuately typical american post-modernism.  many educated and privledged people in our country have vicious fears and hatreds, but they have some intellectual artillery and ample physical separation from that which they fear as a first layer of defense.  yesterday's predjudices were more of the KKK variety of militant and monomanical proclamations, whereas the current ethos of this country is more one of apathetic and lazy hate.

sarah's comedy seems to skewer right through the heart of this.  she is a self centered jewish american princess who isn't afraid of being homophobic and racist because she is both attractive and educated, allowing her easy access to worlds that can nuture her away from that which she isn't compatible with.  however at the same time, her ""character"" is cranky and acidic, an indication that the confusing and ugly world can seap into even a spoiled girl's mind and cause dissonance.  sarah handles this and fleshes out her routine by using typically american lingo, lilting voice patterns, and dead-pan eye-rolls and hair tosses.

it is difficult to describe, but it is a complex approach that hits on several levels simultaneously.  i think in this way sarah silverman is a great treasure and is offering something unlike what i've seen before.  i love american-styled ""meta-comedy"" such as mr. show (which she is alumnus), and sarah silverman may improve with time and become an even sharper jab into american obliviousness, or she may lose steam.  time will tell.

but for now ""jesus is magic"" is a peek into a powerful american comedy that suffers some by that always ugly head-rearing desire to bust into mediocre song stylings.",1149724800,2,3292,4.9113924050632916
2548195,4,B000F1IO3O,"Sarah Silverman Jesus is Magic has got to be one of the funniest stand up comedy performances I've seen in recent years.  It's a combination of Christopher Guest-style mockumentary and stand-up comedy interspersed with musical performances.  Silverman tackles topics from 9/11 to AIDS to the Holocaust and everything in between.  She says the things no one else has the guts to and does so with admirable aplomb.  The title of the movie comes from one of the earlier jokes about the possibilty of the Jewish Silverman and her Catholic boyfriend having children.  She jokes that they'd just be honest with the children telling them, ""Mommy is one of the chosen people and Daddy thinks Jesus is Magic.""  Silverman emphasizes the importance of putting a positive spin on everything, ie, when life gives you AIDS make lemonAIDS.  That's just a taste of the hilarious and over-the-top comedy of this movie.  I laughed out loud several times.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend, but it's not for anyone who doesn't have the ability to laugh at themselves and everyone around them.  Also, be sure to watch through the credits which include even more jokes, including a teenage girl delivering Sarah's jokes to an audience with very different results.",1149638400,,1253,4.980769230769231

Having never seen her live before, I'd only seen clips of her act here and there, so it was great to see a full live act.  Her act is great and I love how she makes fun of all the uncomfortable moments her jokes create.  The musicial interludes throughout the movie kinda reminded me of an old Dennis Leary special.  The music is very different, but equally as fitting and hilarious.

Here you're chance to get your rocks off to the greatest ill splitter of sides to come down the pike since Cleopatra.
More performance then your regular run of the mill stand-up routine, it seems the only thing hindering this presentation is the unfortunate decision to mount stiff and inelegant skits and musical numbers (although some are quite good) into the equation, as it just never quite gels.
Still the stand-up should more than make up for it as it is one of the most accomplished and beautiful acted out routines, Ive ever seen.

Also be sure to check out Sarahs new stand-up show, the Emmy award winning We are Miracles as it is even funnier than this showcase.

She says that she as a Jew would crucify Christ again in a f-ing second. What a blasphmeous thing to say. Hollywood loves to attack Jesus Christ and Christianity. I wonder how big it would go over if they attack other beliefs,such as Islam,Buddhaism,Hinduism or others. It's only Jesus they love to attack. All of this proves Jesus was right,when he said the world is gonna hate me,because I testify that it's works are evil. And boy oh boy,was he ever right. That is why ""Hollyweird"" will NEVER attack Buddha,Mohammed,Krishna,or any other religious figure....only Jesus Christ. Most Jews today hate Jesus just as much as they did 2,000 years ago,and it shows. When Pilate washed his hands clean,the Jews said let his(Jesus) blood be on them and their childen.

2548221,1,B000F1IO3O,"The first rule of comedy: Be Funny

Sarah S. shows some cleverness. Problem is she is first a self-indulgent Jewish shock comedienne and then a performer. (The video ""Give the Jew Girl a Toy"" is cute but too much all at the same time. She has a point but don't belabor that point. Sorry, you can't base a career on Santa Claus)

When a performer is so much into themselves we seem to be intruding on their inner thoughts; that's where the therapy comes in. However self-loathing, public revelation trumps the poignancy of social commentary.

There are the obligatory comments about Nazis, German cars etc. Too bad she had to start the show with an attack on Jesus and Catholicism. Do I have to really say that for a Jew who understands the Holocaust she should be a bit tolerant of other people's religion? Who is she pandering to by insulting Jesus?

Shocking but still politically correct.
She jokes (a little) about gay men and she jokes (a little) about Black men but never crosses the political correction line. There is the obligatory non-judgmental attitude towards gays and Blacks.  She implies gay sex is okay for them but not for her. She talks about the ""N-word"" but then cowers in front of a couple of Black men (in an otherwise charming music video) lest they beat her.

Adolescent filthy jokes about sex and the toilet, laced with profanity are no substitute for maturity nor sophistication. She is willing to take a bullet; she implies sexual abuse as a youth but that doesn't make her any funnier nor her words more truthful.

Comedy is difficult but also very easy.
Get a group of people and say outrageous things, add alcohol, and people will laugh. Anyone can do that once but do it on a regular basis and you become a successful comic. Part of Silverman's appeal is that she says outrageous things; so what genius does that take?",1340064000,7,1849,4.636085626911315

Anyway, Sarah's stand up performance is EXACTLY what I expected- nonstop offensive humor pertaining to the subjects of sex and race. It's almost entirely THESE two subjects and nothing else, which is why I lowered the rating one point. I would have preferred more variety.  Then again if you make it your mission to disrespect people as hard as possible, these are definitely the best two subjects to allow it to happen!

Her style of performing was nice to see. She delivers jokes very slowly to allow the audience to anticipate (and appreciate) when the main point of the joke is revealed, and normally wraps an interesting story behind the jokes (usually pertaining to family members) which is not much different from Larry the Cable Guy, to be honest.

I WAS a little shocked how graphic her choice of words were. Normally female comedians don't go *that* far with the amount of crudeness, and I'd say not even someone who's normally offensive such as Wanda Sykes ever goes that far.

While I did not see this with high expectations as I am not a huge fan of stand-up acts (which is what this piece is at its core), even those werer not fully met. Sarah is cute, funny, and her play on words would have made for a good 20 minute short. Instead we get over an hour of songs, skits, and other filler, to try and give it some air by getting out off the stage. Some stuff works, some works for a while, and some is just not funny.

If you are a fan, rent it and watch it with other Sarah fans, and you'll have on OK time. Now that Margaret Cho has become almost an irrelevant one trick pony, Sarah is one of the few truly funny females around who mixes it up.

And the jokes aren't even very funny. Most of the laughter from the audience seems to be of the nervous kind. Brash and offensive jokes work when you don't do them ALL THE TIME.

I find it odd that she gets away with telling so many black jokes and throwing around the ""n"" word so much. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that she is attractive, female and Jewish. If Larry the Cable guy ever said the ""n"" word on a comedy DVD, I guarantee you that Al Sharpton would already be carrying his head around on the end of a stick.

In seeing the clips, i assumed the rest of the show would have been as funny as the clips.. I was so wrong.

A lot of it is funny, and Silverman does have good comedic timing and an interesting set of jokes, but sometimes the humor of an entire joke is based solely on shock value. If the joke was funny, then shock value would just add to the humor, but shock alone does not a joke make.

To me, Silverman seems like a spoiled girl that uses her innocent cute girl look and potty mouth to cash in on people's insecurities with racial and other taboo material. You get the feeling that Silverman is saying if you're offended then you're just too up tight. But I don't know if that's entirely true. When she's at her grandmother's funeral screaming ""You're dying! You're dying!"" it's a little too in-your-face for me, and I can't even really tell if she's trying to be funny or crossing the line into shock value alone.

Overall, this movie is a great concept and executed extremely well. I was laughing almost the entire time. It seems like something that other comics would pick up on and follow her example.

But I really find it hard to believe that any thinking person could find this material funny, more than a little.  In the entire running time, I chuckled out loud once.  More than anything, the production is an excuse for Silverman to use every ""naughty"" word English has to offer.  Now, I don't have a problem with adult language, but it had better serve a purpose larger than shock value.  I wasn't shocked.  By any of it.  It's not like there's anything she says or shows that's new or fresh *and* funny.  Why do Jews drive German cars?  Because Jews, by and large, are far more concerned with social status than political propriety.  Duh.

And for the few of you out there who don't know, the boyfriend to whom she frequently alludes is Jimmy Kimmel, he of the late night talk show.

Occasionally her style mimics that of Wendy Lieberman, where she starts of saying something that has the audience thinking one way, but then says something unexpected and ""shocking"" and, caught by surprise, the audience laughs.  Problem is, it's rarely funny when Ms. Lieberman does it, and never funny when Ms. Silverman does it.

The musical numbers do little more than detract.  Their one redemption is that she has an above-average singing voice.  Maybe she'd be better suited to doing material along the lines of Stephen Lynch.

On stage, I doubt she could appear more wooden if she tried.  Compared to a comedic great like Eddie Izzard, she looks like a middle schooler who just learned all the dirty words, but doesn't know what to do with them.

2548274,5,B000F1IO3O,"Sarah Silverman takes comedy to a whole new level that makes everything else seem stale and conservative. She's a rare breed of comedian who, like Tom Green and Andy Kaufman, is more interested in consistently surprising her audience than in developing a rapport with them.
Most of her act involves making wide-eyed naive statements which treat irrational, and often offensive, beliefs as second nature and leave it up to you to conclude what the irrational belief behind the statement is, but she always finds a way to express it through using the kind of banal anecdotal approach a lot of comedians use to set up their jokes, so it catches you off-guard while also parodying conventional stand-up technique.
She does use shock value, but she has a uniquely clever way with twist punchlines. Like that one joke she does about licking jelly off her boyfriend. She starts out with the dirty part, and then uses the clean part, the common phrase the dirty part is playing off of (""oh my god i'm turning into my mother""), as the punchline. I think that's unprecedented. I mean tell me any other dirty joke with a twist punchline by any other comedian which starts out with the dirty part and uses the clean part as the punchline.
The comedic value of her material is really in the irrationality of the ideas she expresses. Like she has this one old bit which is like ""I don't like going out to dance clubs. It's very embarassing for me. Because I tapdance."" Most of her more recent offensive material works the same way, throwing in a twist punchline which reveals an amusingly irrational perspective, but the offensive material is open to a more superficial interpretation which disregards the cleverness of the context and sees her appeal as being merely her willingness to be outrageous. I think she's underselling herself by using shock value so much now. I like the way she uses it to play with people's irrational pavlovian responses though. Like if a particular word is considered offensive because it's something usually said with contempt, people will react to the word the same way even when they know it's not being said with contempt.
She's not like a lot of social critic comedians who only find fault with conservatives. If anything she seems to take an entirely outside perspective on humanity to better illuminate it's ridiculousness, and if you can't see humanity from that detached perspective yourself you're unlikely to get a lot out of her material. I guess it still works on the more superficial shock value level of just a cute girl saying messed up stuff, but I think there's a big line between people who like her act because they relate to her perspective and those who just like her material because they consider it so outrageous.",1160179200,7,2755,4.802105263157895

I should probably watch it again... I probably would anyway, because most of it was pretty hilarious, but I can't pinpoint exactly what this film was missing. It could have been that I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. Is this a stand up comedy act? Is this a series of skits? Is this a documentary?

2548279,3,B000F1IO3O,"I had heard that Sarah Silverman's comedy on this feature DVD of her stand-up performance was outrageous in the extreme and vulgar. Well, I don't think it stretches to any extremes. You can find far worse. But it is fairly crude in patches. And I'm not sure these patches are funny enough to justify the verbal violence. If you are going to butcher sacred cows, you had better have a pretty sharp knife. And Silverman's monolgue doesn't always qualify.

For example, I'm not sure her harmonizing trio of body orifices is funny enough to justify the vulgarity. Several of her songs are pretty lame. The offstage masturbation scene is pointless. And what is that raging argument about her brand of bottled water all about? Was there supposed to be a joke about product placement in there somewhere?

Also, she lapses into jolting reticence on one point. She is quite willing to sling out all the vulgarisms for the various body parts. But then she inexplicably refers to excrement as ""dooty."" Why the sudden reversion to baby-talk?

But I got a few genuine guffaws along the way and could appreciate the number of times she really rips the cloth out from under our polite, silver-service conversation. Her joke about AIDS is a classic. And her rejoinder to Martin Luther King is hilarious.

As director Liam Lynch says on the Commentary though, Silverman is essentially an actress. I was engrossed (and yes sometimes grossed out) watching her act out the various petulant, self-absorbed moods of a ""J.A.P."" (After a comedy beat, Silverman corrects the audience's natural assumption about what she meant by that and says of course she meant she was Japanese.) But her expressiveness in her role makes the movie/DVD a much better experience than going to her live performances. Here you can see every pout, every pondering up close.

There are a lot of extras on the DVD, but most of the material isn't very worthwhile. Having a Director/Silverman Commentary is a bit circular since Silverman's stage performance is itself a social commentary. And now I'm commenting on the Commentary on the commentary. So we are getting really far removed from any direct experience. The only interesting feature I found about the Director Commentary was the fact of Lynch's obvious admiration for and appreciation of Silverman's every piece of shtick.

Please keep in mind that it could be EXTREMLY offensive to some, but I think the vast majority of people out there will find it HILARIOUS!

2548281,2,B000F1IO3O,"Well, I guess we need humor to soften or make sense of life's hard parts.  But shock-value comics can easily slip into vulgarity, and who wants to catch themselves laughing at vulgarity?  My common reactions to this DVD were ""did she really say that?!?"", not ""gee, that was funny"".  I do like her amusement at life's incongruities and wish she could do more of that and less orifice humor.

Silverman seems to have little sense of comic timing; she just seems to stumble across punch lines or almost forgets to recite them.  Her continual playing with her hair was an annoyance and borderline unprofessional.  The pretaped segments and music videos were lame and obvious padding/filler.

Root-canal comics often back themselves into a one-dimensional outhouse of their own building.  Use of the f-word automatically tends to crowd out the subtle gradations between reality and what-should-be from which most humor springs.",1155168000,6,922,5.140939597315437
2548282,5,B000F1IO3O,"true. the dvd isn't for a select few, who 'get it'.

nor is it for a mass demographic to understand, or want to walk a mile in a dvd's shoes.

its for everyone. love it or hate it.

im of the camp that would love to hate it, but in the end ..hate that it took so long to accept that i love it. and it boils down to delivery. every entertainment market is filled to the brim with artists, all to rady to claim the credit ..extending from any reaction they can enable. sarah delivers, and its up to the individual to discern whether they can enjoy it. everything sarah dishes out is ours to keep, so i won't spend time digesting her act for sake of the review.

i won't claim that everyone will enjoy it. but even for those who hate it.. and from what ive read here, its genuine:

theres something to be said of any performer that extends the right to respond personally.

object on the basis that you expected to condone.

praise on the basis that you were expecting less.

or enjoy it, as everything, for what its worth (?)

as for the product, its a mix of documentary/sketch comedy/ and full-fledged concert film. there are alotta great glimpses into sarahs world. the cut scences could stand on their own, if only there were more. and the music has all the character id expect of a routine show. the live cuts comes off well enough, and thanks to great editing focus on delivery.

its anything but standard when you consider how many children are starving in the world today.",1154736000,3,1478,4.341818181818182

2548284,4,B000F1IO3O,"Sarah Silverman is called ""the hippest comic working today"" in a quote from the New Yorker appearing on the cover of the DVD. After watching her for the first time in this film, I think the quote is more than mere hyperbole. Silverman is definitely on the cutting edge of comedy; this will appeal to some and alienate others. While she is very funny, she also expresses a kind of harsh, unapologetic nihilism that is part of modern/postmodern hipness. This film is about three-quarters stand-up routine; the rest are scenes filmed in various locations. There are a few musical numbers as well. Silverman's greatest talent is in her delivery and facial expressions. She takes on a persona of innocence and naivete while saying the most offensive things imaginable. She is able to convey a wide range of subtle and nuanced moods. In the opening sequence, for example, she is speaking to two friends who are telling her about their creative projects. At this point, she tells them about her own show which (according to the script that is) she hasn't even really written yet. She listens to her friends with an expression that perfectly expresses uncertainty and insecurity. Similarly, during her stand-up routine, she is able to replicate the tone of the insipidly inoffensive while delivering the verbal equivalent of poison darts.

 She discusses (as we can guess from the title) Jesus, 9-11, the Holocaust, her grandmother's death and a myriad of racial stereotypes with a straightforward insensitivity and irreverence that is at once original, shocking and hilarious. What makes Silverman unusual is not only that she goes further than most comics dare, but that at no time does she ever backpedal from her ruthless onslaughts of sacred cows.  Reading some other opinions on Silverman, I notice that she is compared, both favorably and unfavorably to Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor and George Carlin -all male comics. I hate to make what sounds like such a banal, politically-correct observation (which is especially ironic when discussing Silverman's material), but I can't help but suspect that many people have a harder time accepting such hard-edged material from a female comic.

Some portions of Jesus Is Magic work better than others. I did not find all of the musical numbers especially entertaining or funny. The stand-up portion is otherwise nicely framed by the introduction, where she plans the show, and ending, where she haughtily snubs some friends who visit her dressing room. I will definitely look for more from her in the future. After watching her for two hours (including the supplementary material on the DVD, which has her scene from The Aristocrats among other things), I honestly don't know if Sarah Silverman is a racist, self-absorbed narcissist or if she is just very good at playing one. I suspect she likes it that way.",1154476800,2,2847,5.038216560509555
2548285,5,B000F1IO3O,"This movie/musical/variety show/stand-up routine is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time. Sarah Silverman holds nothing back (making fun of Martin Luther King is both original and genious) and puts together one of the funniest routines out there. The songs are both funny and well-performed and the material in her stand-up routine is side-splitting. A huge step up from all the ""blue collar comedy"" that's so popular right now (definition of blue collar comedy - a comedian who isn't black or jewish).

Everything I've seen her do I loved, from the first time I saw her do a commentary on SNL News through this, it's always a treat to hear her unique humor and delivery.  ...hey...you can edit reviews now... this DVD grows on you with multiple viewings, so i've moved it up to 5 stars",1152489600,,498,4.380434782608695
2548289,2,B000F1IO3O,"Sarah Silverman is a hit-or-miss comedienne. Some people will really take onto her, finding her controversial jokes to be witty and clever. Others will simply see her as a comedienne that only tells jokes for shock value, finding the jokes completely forced and not clever at all. Much like the comedienne featured, this DVD is completely hit-or-miss. The DVD is a mixture of her stand-up act, a few songs, and some skits with her sister, Laura Silverman, and fellow comedian, Brian Posehn. Some of this DVD had me really laughing, but the majority of the DVD had me in silence. Every joke she tells on the DVD either was a complete home run of a joke or fell completely flat with me.

The standup act on the DVD is probably the least funny of everything. It is in the standup portion that she must rely on only herself and I didn't think she did a very good job from it. Her subjects ranged from 9/11 and AIDS to Jews and the Chinese, but one thing is guaranteed: all of her jokes involved some type of shock value. If you know Sarah Silverman, you know that her jokes rely on stereotypes, racism, and other shocking subject matter, so that's to be expected. What I didn't expect was how flat some of her jokes were. It didn't seem like she was really trying most of the time, as the majority of her jokes seemed to rely only on the shock and not really anything funny.

The other parts of the DVD are a bit stronger because she has more to rely on than just herself. The skits with her sister and Brian Posehn are pretty funny, largely due to the fact that her and Posehn have very good chemistry together (probably because the two are friends in real life.) The musical portions, which take us away from the stage and into, seemingly, a music video, are also funny at times, but some jokes do fall flat. I'd say that the highlight of the DVD is the interaction between Posehn and Silverman, which is great. I'm actually quite sure that it's because of the fact that she's not trying to be ""shocking"" around him in the skits and is just being her natural self.

Largely due to the fact that the DVD was pretty much half-and-half, I'm forced to give this two and a half stars. As I said before, her jokes throughout the DVD were totally hit-or-miss, either very funny or completely flat. In my mind, the DVD was a disappointment. She's a very funny comedienne, but her jokes on this DVD don't represent her as such. If you're a big fan of Silverman, you'll probably enjoy this DVD, but I, as an average Silverman fan, found that a lot of her jokes on this DVD relied only on shock value and really contained nothing that was really funny.",1152316800,3,2639,4.414784394250513

2548291,1,B000F1IO3O,"WOW........this was bad.
I think I laughed maybe twice tops.
This was not entertaining at all mainly because her humour is strange, pointless and disturbing. (Nana's funeral, enough said)
I enjoy comedians like Dane Cook, Chris Rock, Margaret Cho, Russel Peters, George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, Seinfeld and more. So, as you can see I have a pretty wide variety of comedic tastes and I don't mind racial humour when it is done fairly (meaning no race is exempt) like Russel Peters. I think the most important thing about a comedian is thier ability to make you see/feel/understand what they are saying. But Sarah Silverman can't do that at all. Be warned, you have to already be like her going in or else you won't like this at all. ( read some of the other reviews before watching this )
 I still don't know even vaguely what her point is.

2548292,1,B000F1IO3O,"I had really looked forward to seeing this after hearing Sarah interviewed several times.  I know her humor can offend people, but that's usually because they don't catch the ""tongue-in-cheekness"" of it.  This, well...  I was disappointed.  There were a few clever jokes, but by and large it was pretty dull.  I have to admit that I didn't stick it out and just turned it off after 20 minutes.  I was expecting something hilarious and instead I got a marginally decent stand-up routine and two incredibly dumb skits.

I wouldn't sell your Sarah Silverman stock yet, but I would DEFINTELY recommend you rent this if you've got a burning desire to see it.  Even then, it may not be worth the price of admission :(",1151193600,7,711,4.632
2548293,2,B000F1IO3O,"I've been looking forward to seeing this for several months. I've enjoyed Silverman's style & edge in the past.

Alas, this film was only occasionally funny. There were some terrific one-liners...but it was long & drawn out, and painfully slow at times. I agree with Roger Ebert - watching this movie makes me want to see Sarah Silverman in something else.

Watching the movie was like watching a son or daughter perform at the school play - you really wanted her to do well, despite screwing up all the lines.

The only real ""edge"" in this one were some toilet and pen*s jokes - otherwise, she was playing it safe. The singing was a bit dull, and the skits came off as something they threw in to make it a ""real movie"" instead of just a stand up routine. But 75% of the movie was standup, and it wasn't really her best stuff.

Maybe she's best in smaller doses.",1150848000,9,862,4.40251572327044

If, on the other hand, you can't come to terms with basic human behavior you won't. That's not idiocy on her part, it's yours. It's just easier to pretend otherwise.

Only issues: the background is cool for theater, but not so much for video; and the editor had five cams and decided to 'look what I can do with Final Cut Pro' rather than focus on the delivery. neither kill, but they niggle.

2548295,3,B000F1IO3O,"Not sure what I was expecting with 'Jesus is Magic'...I've heard great things about Sarah Silverman as a comedian.  At times, the standup was funny, but in general it was very crude and didn't strike me as that intelligent.  I'm not sure what the appeal is with Silverman, maybe it's that a semi-attractive woman is saying such obscene things? I can't say that her routine was shocking, unless it's in the same sense that Howard Stern is 'shocking'...the crude obscene nature appeared to be the norm with her routine, so there were no dynamics in the rhythm of her comedy routine.

The musical numbers were disturbing at best.  They provided no added-value to the film.  In fact, they were distracting and by the end of the film, I was fast forwarding through them.",1150588800,5,765,4.7218045112781954
2548296,3,B000F1IO3O,"Don't get me wrong....I didn't HATE it....I got the jokes...And I did laugh aloud from time to time. However, it didn't have me 'gasping for air' at any moment like some of these other viewers have clearly experienced. I read of how funny she is cause her humor is so ""clever"" so ""intelligent"" (?????) Did I miss something?? Some of her comic material hints of being juvenile...some of it just downright poopy *lol*! Like in the ""porn song""....Not only a few of the lyrics but that particular ""doodle"" projected in the background towards the end of the song (reminded me of those notebook doodles all to common in junior high)...That 'bonus' video ""give the jew girl toys""?? Just seems to confirm my findings. Not to mention the disappointing 'finale'...I'm not going to give it away, but it just goes to show you what I said about juvenile ""poopy"" humor.

Furthermore, after viewing the movie, I find it folly to compare Silverman to other ""controversial"" comedians such as Richard Pryor...or Wanda Sykes?? Thier angles in comedy are different than Silverman's...I've seen them mostly talk about things in the world and in thier lives and they use humor to get you to see things through thier eyes...They use thier humor to lower everything in life/the world into an even playing field... Not Silverman....She lowers them to levels that are beneath her so she can kick, stomp and spit on them for the sake of a (cheap) laugh.

She cracks a few funny jokes, but sitting through to get to them is like bobbing for apples in a barrel of toxic acid.

Therefore, be advised: Her humor is not for everyone. The best word to describe it (IMHO): very BRACKISH. Scathing, but mostly in all the wrong ways.

I considered watching the commentary so I could see just what thoughts went behind this creation....but that meant watching the whole thing over again....ehhhhh...no thanks...not THAT curious.

Though I did find it occasionally funny...I didn't LOVE it....or hate it. It was neither here nor there for me....

Every one of Sarah's jokes hinges on the fact that she is a, very mildly, attractive girl saying somethign ""awful"".  Sorry, but I didn't laugh once.

Whoever said she is original is way off.  What is original about saying dirty joke? There is not an ounce of humanity or even anything thought provoking in her humor.  She leaves me scratching my head wondering if this is the new  acceptable form of comedy.  I certainly hope not.  She is a few rungs below burlesque if you ask me.

Please think before you say you like this movie.  Ask yourself a few questions:

1.  Why did I laugh?

2.  Why didn't I laugh?
