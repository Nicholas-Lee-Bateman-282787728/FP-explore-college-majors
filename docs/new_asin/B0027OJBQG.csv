8354940,5,B0027OJBQG,"Damn the security recording that told everyone to stay where they were.
It cost them their lives, I also realize that anyone above the crash zone in Tower One was doomed.
There was was only one stairwell open in Tower Two.
This Documentary covered the dramatic and frantic attempt to escape the doomed towers before their imminent collapse.
The dramatization depicted in this Documentary probably will never compare to the chaos of 9/11 but the DVD was very well done and I could easily watch this again.
As sad as this is, it's a fitting testimony to the brave souls who, in some cases, gave some, while others gave all.",1471046400,,621,4.654545454545454

8354947,5,B0027OJBQG,"This DVD explains what happened inside the Twin Towers on 9/11, through interviews and masterful reinactments. You'll see desks turning over on people and huge fireballs blowing doors off elevators well below the inpact zone. And that tremendous cracking sound as the buildings collapse. The closest thing to being in there that you'll ever experience.",1364169600,9,352,5.418181818181818
8354948,5,B0027OJBQG,"If you like documentaries then this is a must see. Since 9-11-01 I have had an interest in the events that happened on that day and this DVD tells the stories of those who were inside of the towers from the second of the first impact, to the aftermath of the collapse. It depicts the stories of those who made it out alive, and those who were not as fortunate. In this DVD you'll follow the stories of several people who worked in the trade centers those days and witness their individual acts of bravery and for some of them the luck of their situations. You'll also follow the story of Ladder Co. 6, who became trapped in the collapse and were successfuly rescued hours later.",1292630400,15,678,4.388888888888889
