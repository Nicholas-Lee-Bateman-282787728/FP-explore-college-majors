7800046,2,0780021789,This was an interesting film about a young girl (a rather dispicable character) who leaves home after a phyical altercation with her mother and hits the road with her boyfriend and a male companion with the intent of finding a new life in Tel Aviv and of their adventures along the way. The cinematography was great but I was very much disapointed to find that the video was not really in widescreen as advertised. If I had known I never would have purchased it. The film should be released on DVD in it's full screen size. I give it only two stars because of my dispointment.,1058313600,2,576,4.443396226415095
