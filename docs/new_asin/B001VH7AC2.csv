IT HAS FIGHTING, ACTION, BLOOD, DANCING AND MARTIAL ARTS. AND IT HAS A GREAT MUSIC SOUND TRACK. PLUS, THE STORY PLOT IS GOOD AND IT KEEPS YOU ENTERTAINED. YOU WONT BE BORED. I REALLY RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU LIKE MOVIES, CANIBLES AND ZOMBIES..YOU WOULD WANT TO PUT THIS ON YOUR LIST OF DVD'S TO BUY. IT'S NOT TO SERIOUS AND HAS SOME COMEDY IN IT.
