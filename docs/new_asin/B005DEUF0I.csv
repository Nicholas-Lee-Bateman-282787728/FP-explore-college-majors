4658721,5,B005DEUF0I,"I love this anime and it is well worth the price I paid. I've never seen any other anime like it as it focuses almost completely on drift racing and makes it fun and interesting. At the decent price point I'd highly recommend giving it a try or if you can stream it online I would definitely encourage you to give it a try. I will say that normally I don't go for anime anything like this, I usually go for more like GitS or Darker than Black but I love this so even if you don't think you'll care for it I'd at least recommend giving it a try if you can stream it.",1357862400,5,565,3.9217391304347826

4658724,5,B005DEUF0I,"I've been a fan of the series for a while, but really didn't like the TokyoPop Americanized version so I was very happy to find the whole series redone by Funimation.  While I appreciate that TokyoPop discs have the original Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles, they distract from the action.  It seemed the Funimation dialogue more closely matched the scene.  Love the fact that they packaged them so compactly.  One nitpick, I kind of wish the green S.A.V.E. band was on the right rather than wrapping around the spine, it makes it harder to see the title of the disc (in tiny print) when stored on the shelf.  Great quality, great value!",1332201600,3,647,4.741071428571429
4658725,4,B005DEUF0I,"I just ordered this for my girlfriend's 7 year old son, who is really into drift racing.  Having watched other versions of this anime in the past (Japanese language with English subtitles, and I don't speak Japanese), I had no idea that the English dub here was going to contain profanity.  It does contain at least one instance of the F-bomb, so do beware of showing it to small children, or I suppose, anyone else who might be offended.",1328486400,2,438,4.531645569620253

4658742,5,B005DEUF0I,"One of my all time favorite anime series.  I never tire of watching this. No matter how many times I watch it, I still find myself glued to the screen as if the outcome of each race may have changed since the last time I watched it. Is it perfect? Certainly not, but the flaws are easy to overlook when the story is this good. If you like cars and street racing, this is a must see. The story is pretty much timeless. The English dub is very good. Many times it is far better to read the subtitles in foreign films and anime, but they did a superb job capturing the context rather than just a direct word for word translation from Japanese to English. The anime is light years better than the live action movie version. I strongly prefer the relationship between Takumi and Bunta in this over the live action. Stop thinking about it and order the dvd already. You won't regret it!",1486080000,,880,4.301204819277109

4658780,4,B005DEUF0I,"First of all, if you're like me and want to know if this is the good version of the english dub, yes it is the FUNIMATION DUB.

Definitely a good place to start off with if you're looking for a very laid back, relaxing, and really down to earth show about cars going side ways.
The english dub is probably one of the best I've heard, and it really fits in with the mood of the series in general.
The packaging came very cleanly and intact.

This content doesn't get 4 stars just due to the video quality, but still is completely viewable with no problems.

From my impression on this first set, I'm definitely going to buy the rest.

STAY AWAY FROM TOKYO ENGLISH DUB AT ALL COSTS.",1439510400,5,680,4.248062015503876

4658807,3,B005DEUF0I,"8 years ago I downloaded all the existing episodes on the web from First Stage. Since then they've been copied and moved from PC to PC over the years. I've got this DVD running split screen side-by-side with my fansubbed downloaded copies from 8 years ago in VLC media player.. I have to say, running them side by side, my 8 year old copies have better clearer, louder audio encoding. Also, the picture quality of the DVD is faded and colors are under-saturated by comparison. It makes the video look MUCH older than it is. (think VHS) In addition, there are visible black borders on this DVD video, on my files there are not. Further, the motion of the animation causes lines to appear over the moving parts..like digital remastering gone bad. It is somewhat clearer in some scenes than on my existing files..but almost an invisible difference. The most notable thing is the blacks are all medium grey and not black. This kills a lot of the video contrast, but seems to have brightened the playback just a little. Makes it easier to see detail in the backgrounds during the numerous after-dark scenes. Finally, the subtitles are jagged and harder to read on this DVD copy than the free fan-subs on my copies..I speak Japanese well enough to know they are accurate though. The Japanese audio option is much better in terms of stereo audio quality. It seems like the publisher moving to a 5.1 surround encoding is nice but it came at the cost of audio quality. Overall, its nice to have the peace of mind that I have a physical copy to backup my files with..I love this animation title. I've been watching Fujiwara grow up episode to episode for over a decade. If you're new to Initial D, buy this. If you like cars, and anime..this is one of the greats. It starts off slow, but it grows on you quickly. Enjoy!",1384819200,6,1809,4.552147239263804

4658824,5,B005DEUF0I,"Back in the mid-2000s, Initial D was already an established property that many anime fans and car enthusiasts loved (including myself). With that much popularity circulating, it was only a matter of time before the US localized it and presented it to America.

So... US anime/manga distributor Tokyopop licensed the distribution rights to the Initial D anime as well as the manga it was based on.

In their attempt at creating an experience that could appeal to a wider audience, Toykopop did things that are totally unacceptable in today's US anime market.

* Names were changed/altered
* The original true-to-life car sounds were replaced with generic sound effects
* The Super Eurobeat soundtrack (a trait the series had become known for) was removed in favor of generic rap/rock music
* The computer-generated race sequences were given added ""special effects"" (this was the most questionable edit they made and still baffles me)
* A simplified translation that lost almost ALL the racing technicality in the process

Tokyopop tried to justify these edits by including the original Japanese versions of the episodes in the discs they had. But... the fans had spoken. The localization treatment Tokyopop gave to Initial D was horrible.

As time passed... it seemed like the US would never see Initial D in proper English. That is until Tokyopop lost the rights in 2008 and Funimation picked it up.

Now that the history lesson is over, it's onto the actual review :)

---

The first thing you'll notice about the Funimation version is that the original audio and soundtrack of the show has been kept in tact. They did what was originally expected the FIRST time it was being brought to America: ACCURATELY translate Initial D into English.

Initial D's dialog is one of those animes that uses a relaxed, everyday way of speaking. Tokyopop's did their best to honor this by forcefully adding in slang phrases like ""DUDE!! TAK'S EIGHT-SIX IS GETTING PUNKED!!""

Funimation also recognized the ""relaxed"" speak in their translation. But, they have scripted it in such a way that it doesn't feel forced at all. While they do use words like 'frikkin' and 'dude', the Funimation voice cast does its best to make it sound like talking and not script reading.

Also... props to the head of voice casting for finding suitable voice actors for each character (something the Tokyopop version missed by a LONGshot). Takumi, for one, sounds his age for once! But the real shining factor of the Funimation dub is that almost every character has an american voice that is pretty much an English version of their Japanese counterpart. Ryosuke Takahashi sounds pretty spot on :P

It's unfortunate that it's taken THIS long for America to get Initial D in an acceptable form. But, in the end, it was definitely worth the wait! The only thing I'm asking for now... is for a blu-ray release of this material.

And... I cannot wait until Initial D Fifth Stage is brought to US shores. Keep up the good work, Funimation :)",1366502400,35,3000,4.893491124260355

I'll review the other seasons when I get the chance to watch those. The dubbing is good, though different from my last set. What I like it the original sound effects and soundtrack is present. The last set had rap music, missing sound effects(86's high speed warning bell indicator), and the characters were given nicknames, ie Tak, Iggy, Cole, Natalie, etc. I like hearing Nakazato's toccata theme song when he pulls up behind his opponent, the original soundtrack is just made to make the races exciting.
