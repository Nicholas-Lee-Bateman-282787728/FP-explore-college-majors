2738287,1,B000MQ4WOC,"I used to believe that there really wasn't a way to know what the worst movie of all time was, but now I know it's Zombies Gone Wild. Now I do enjoy watching bad horror movies but this goes way beyond that. I think that jamming a rusty fork in my eye would be more enjoyable than watching this movie. I do have to say my favorite part of the movie was when the random people walked into the scene not knowing the worst movie of all time was being filmed. If you have someone that you hate, I suggest thinking twice before sending this 'film' and asking youself 'How much do I really hate this person?'  On the upside, anything that you watch next is a masterpiece. Even Uncle Sam or Black Sheep. And I'm dying to watch Pearl Harbor now too.",1236729600,,740,4.174825174825175
2738288,1,B000MQ4WOC,"I am going to forego my regular review format, as I find that it isn't necessary.

No comments on actors, production or special effects.

Just know that this movie is one of the BIGGEST pieces of crap to have ever graced a DVD. There simply is NO reason to watch this movie. Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) about this movie is complete and utter garbage. An insult to the genre. Even the director / writer was embarrassed by it and only used his initials. You would be better off to just stare at a blank t.v. screen for 102 minutes. Seriously.

Amazon really needs to add a ""No Star"" option.",1236297600,,595,4.390909090909091
2738289,1,B000MQ4WOC,"As these movies are typically made by some small studio trying to be creative in the genre while working with an extremely small budget, I ordinarily approach zombie movies like this with a large degree of suspended disbelief.  In this case, my suspended disbelief lasted only thirty minutes before I had to turn off the movie.

This is not an example at even an honest effort at a good B-movie.  No attempt was made at lighting, no attempt was made at audio, no attempt was made at acting.  This ""movie"" looks like a bunch of guys got together on a weekend and shot this thing with a five year old mini-cam.  I created better productions than this when I was in high school.  After patiently enduring more than thirty minutes of college kids talking about getting some trim, waiting and hoping that the emergence of zombies would redeem this movie, no zombies came and I turned the film off.",1216166400,,892,4.578616352201258
2738290,2,B000MQ4WOC,"If you're drawn to bad movies the way Bill Clinton is drawn to pizza-bearing interns, then you have to get your hands on Zombies Gone Wild.  This thing is a cinematic cow pie of the most odiferous kind.  The plot is all but nonexistent (I think they made up most of the actual dialogue as they went along), the acting is atrocious, and I can barely even make myself utter the word cinematography when speaking of this film.  Lighting?  What's that?  And there's so much toilet humor that I'm pretty sure the Tidy Bowl Man was listed as a script consultant in the credits.  If you come to this movie for the zombies, prepare to be disappointed - the whole zombie thing never makes any sense, and there's very little gore.  On a positive note, the filmmakers somehow did manage to sneak this movie out under the noses of the PC police, so it is offensive in a number of respects (especially to the deaf community).

As you can see, pretty much all of the necessary ingredients for a gloriously bad movie exist in Zombies Gone Wild.  Early on, much hilarity ensued, making me think this would be THE cult movie event of the year, but the story - such as it is - began to grow a little weary halfway through, and then the actual introduction of the zombies did much to ruin what had come before.  Still, I was still contemplating three, maybe even four stars at that point.  Then I got to the end of the movie, and it was not good.  It was, in fact, an atrocious cop-out that was so unoriginal that it really got my back up.  And so it is that I am giving this movie two stars, solely because of all the laughs it gave me in the first half hour.

Oh, you want to know what the story's about?  Well, it's the story of three friends hitting the road for the spring break shenanigans of a lifetime.  First, there's Marty (Dave Competello): driver of the van, de facto leader of the group, self-described ladies' man, and poster child for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Marty has made it his mission to find as many girls as possible for him and his friends Leroy (Dominique Rochelle) and Randy (Chris Saphire).  The Lord knows neither of his chums could ever get a girl on his own.  Randy is sort of a Rain Man-type character, smart in some ways but mostly just hopelessly stupid, while Leroy is a total Poindexter who makes Steve Urkel look like the Fonz.  I don't know where these guys are actually headed (it sure ain't the beach), but they end up in the middle of nowhere thinking they finally hit the jackpot when they get invited to a party with a couple of deaf girls and a sassy little tease who makes them forget all about the recent news story about a zombie girl having eaten her boyfriend in this very same town.

This is a must-see for lovers of putridly bad movies.  As unwatchable as the movie eventually becomes, the first half hour is absolutely hilarious, especially the scenes wherein the fathers of Leroy and Randy send them off on this adventure of a lifetime.  It's too bad the guys eventually got out of the van and ended up fighting zombies because that's where the film really fell apart and became hopelessly annoying.",1203897600,2,3133,4.429319371727749
2738291,1,B000MQ4WOC,"You need a ZERO star rating for this heap.  It's total TRASH.  It's a camcorder homemade piece of stank.  I couldn't even watch the entire thing, I had to FF through with my DVD remote.  I was so disappointed.  Oh, and don't think for a second you're getting T & A or a girl that looks anywhere near the one on the DVD cover, cuz YOU'RE NOT!!  I'm glad I picked this up for 3.00 from my local store in the clearance.  Even so, I wish I'd spent the 3.00 on some candy.  JUNK!",1188950400,3,474,3.9680851063829787
2738292,1,B000MQ4WOC,"I am a big fan of Zombie movies.  I am a big fan of B movies. I am not a fan of this movie. I'm giving this movie one star only because I am unable to give it a lower rating. This is a horrible, horrible movie.  Do not waste your time even renting this piece of junk. If you want to see a better low budget cheesy zombie flick, check out Redneck Zombies",1181001600,7,353,3.7567567567567566
2738293,1,B000MQ4WOC,"...I have seen a great deal of terrible movies in my lifetime. I usually try to like something about them; however, this one is so bad it is not even worth renting. Now I am a fan of low budget movies. Movies such as Bone Sickness--they have that home shot look, but the difference is that movie was actually good. This one is horribly shot. It looks as if it was shot with a DVD Camcorder, not even using a tripod. In the beginning the camera work is childish at best. The person shooting it keeps shaking the camera, and zooming in and out unnecessarily. There are several instances in which the cameraguy zooms in on on one characters face when another is talking, and you can't even see what the other guy is doing. Horrible. You do not see zombies until an hour into the movie. All you get here is terrible camerawork, horrible sound, stupid story, and a waste of 1.5 hours of your life. I wish I had something good to say about this movie, but I'm ashamed to even have it as part of my collection. Steer clear, way clear of this pile of rubbish.",1177286400,7,1051,4.28643216080402
2738294,1,B000MQ4WOC,"This movie isn't worthy of even one star. It's not even listed on IMDb, and every other god-awful movie I've watched is. You watch it for at least an hour before you ever see a zombie, and in the meantime, it's so horribly bad, you *can't even make fun of it*! The opening credits claim it as the Cohen brothers, but I'm thinking the real Cohen brothers should sue for defamation of character. The only thing scary about the movie is that it was made in the first place. The funniest thing about the movie is that the person who is responsible for it knew it was so terrible that the inclusive writing/directing credit only has his/her initials. The sole upside to the movie is that it gave my boyfriend and I an hour-and-a-half of uninterrupted make-out time because everybody else was smart enough to leave the room before we ever started (the movie or the making out). I have seen a *lot* of really *bad* movies in my time, but this one has to be listed as the *worst*, and that's considering I watched ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-G-Strings/dp/B00007L4M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the G-Strings</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Redneck-Zombies/dp/6305058873/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Redneck Zombies</a>"" in the same afternoon.

8170535,1,B000MQ4WOC,"Three socially inept guys go on a road trip in hopes of a sexual encounter.

The film uses excessive juvenile humor with fart, feces, and barf gags. The unorthodox ending was welcomed. Zombies come in at the end of the film. It was tough to watch.

Guide: F-word. No sex. One see-thru top scene.",1501113600,,295,4.444444444444445
8170536,1,B000MQ4WOC,"SHEAR CRAP! Unwatchable gargbage. The writer thought stupid crude tasteless bathroom humour would help this trash, but it doesn't. My copy is going in the trash. A middle school student could do a better film on an I-phone. I would make a law in congress to ban the makers of this from creating another film. I will re-use the black plastic case from this for a DVD-R.",1499817600,,368,4.507462686567164
8170537,1,B000MQ4WOC,My only thoughts were...Why was this made...I honestly am glad I spent one 1 dollar on it...the acting is bad...the lighting is bad...the story...wait...there is no story...one of the worst zombie films I ever saw.,1450483200,,214,5.142857142857143
8170538,1,B000MQ4WOC,If I could give it negative stars I would. This was absolutely awful and the movie made no sense at all. It only had about 10 minutes of actual zombies and that was lame. You couldn't follow the plot and the ending was a cop out. Only good thing was now I know how irritable bowel syndrome works. I truly believe that it would have hurt less having an actual zombie eat my brain then watching this movie. That's 90 minutes I will never get back.,1435536000,,445,4.186046511627907
8170539,1,B000MQ4WOC,"It is so bad that I have a thing I do with it.
I ask someone whats the worst movie they have ever seen and not really caring what they answer I then say it's credits were far superior to this movie. I inform people this is the worst movie I have ever seen and everyone who watched it has agreed. It has not been dethroned. I then suggest that people watch it so they can say they watched the worst movie ever. I go on to tell them that once they watch it they have the right to make others watch it. Alot of people I know have suffered through this based on that...
My one friend baught his copy for $0.75 and said he over paid... I purchased mine for 7.99 or something like that, and I consider it a very cheap form of torture that has paid for it's self many times over",1361232000,,771,3.948717948717949
8170540,1,B000MQ4WOC,"From the cover of Zombies gone wild you get a completely different impression of the film than what it is really about, there are no zombie chick with swords, there are no action or anything that can be indicated on the cover, all you get are allot of pooping, vomiting and jokes that might be fun when you are five where butt jokes are fun because they are forbidden. Zombies Gone Wild is about a group of three retarded friends who go on a road trip to get laid. Most of the movie is just them goofing around, there is allot, allot, allot of but jokes, allot of vomiting, and allot of senseless idiocy like trying to pay for a motel room with soda cans and so on. The zombies only show up in the last part of the film and they are not worth waiting for, trust me there is only so many times farting zombies are fun.

Zombies gone wild tries for dicey humor and fails, this do not turn out on the edge or even vulgar, it is only infantile. In addition the acting is horrible, the costumes and make up is horrible, the storytelling do not make sense at all, in short there is nothing redeemable about this film. I am normally rather forgiving when it comes to B horror movies, however this is not so bad that it is good, it is just bad, I can not imagine anyone would enjoy this movie.

When I first bought Zombies Gone Wild I looked at the reviews it had gotten here on Amazon but I thought, it can not be that bad, allot of the B horror flicks I enjoy get bad reviews, so I bought it, and I am sad to point out that this time the majority of reviews are 100 percent right, this movie is so bad it do not deserve any stars, it begins bad but slightly amusing, but then after ten minutes turn into a travesty and it go down hill from there.",1309219200,,1740,4.099706744868035
8170541,1,B000MQ4WOC,"OK, I don't mind bad movies; in fact I rather enjoy them.  This one was bad, and I mean real bad.  But I decided to watch it all the way through.  There was a storyline, so just as the movie is about to reach its climax, it turns into a crew and cast get together.  Everyone comes out of character, the crew is on film, and the story never ends.  It may have been conceived as being ""original"" or ""clever""; to me it turned the entire experience into a joke.  A joke on me, as they got my money for a product, and did not provide that complete product to me.

I wish we could offer negative reviews.",1263772800,,598,4.016949152542373
8170542,1,B000MQ4WOC,"I bought this for my boyfriend who LOVES zombies... and I was throughly embarassed because of bad this move turned out to be. This wouldn't have been worth a free movie rental. Crappy script, poor acting, dragged on and on... ended up skipping through scenes and total crap all the way through.

Save your money, get ANY movie other than this.",1250812800,,343,4.622950819672131
8170543,1,B000MQ4WOC,"I don't get why such low budget movies like ""Zombies Gone Wild"" cost so much to order. From what I've been reading in these reviews, this dvd should cost about $5.99 not $19.98.  Come on Amazon!  How about a price recalibration to reflect the original film budget!",1249862400,,264,4.595744680851064
8170544,1,B000MQ4WOC,"As another said & I didn't read ahead of time, this movie doesnt even deserve 1 star.  When are people going to realize that acting like a retard does NOT make a movie funny.  Blow up dolls do NOT make a movie funny.  Seriously, when they finally meet the 3 girls at the community park by the pond, is the one in the middle deaf or from Eastern Europe?  I couldn't tell.  The white guy who played several roles including a black man & in the same persona an Indian (dot, not feather).  Cant make up your mind?  Who's mom played the mom at the beginning?  I paid $2.47 for the movie & another $2.98 for shipping.  I cant ever get this time or money back.  I LOVE b-movies & have over 600 of them.  I honestly cant come up with any words to describe just how horrible this movie is.  The end was everyone discussing their pay before walking off.  Nothing was clever or even remotely humorous.  A frozen burrito is more appealing, seriously.  Dont bother.",1240790400,,952,4.299435028248587
