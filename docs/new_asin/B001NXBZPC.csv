3724036,5,B001NXBZPC,"This little documentary paints an extraordinarily vivid picture of what it would be like to undergo Hurricane Katrina's wrath.  It is extremely well paced, allowing the viewer to full absorb the shocking images of devastation.  But it also touches on the complicated relationship between fathers and sons.  The Vietnam vet survivalist father is a fascinating character, especially in how he seeks to mold his sons.  I only wish the film were longer so that we could explore this relationship more.",1234051200,,497,5.175
3724037,5,B001NXBZPC,"I watched THE CORNER OF HER EYE and thought it was ""eye-opening"" as a first-person account of Katrina. I admit I have not seen any other Katrina films so I'm not sure how it compares, but I thought this film was compelling because it's raw and immediate and unfiltered by memory or distance.

Also, the family dynamics between the three brothers and their father add a layer of emotional intensity.",1233792000,,398,4.685714285714286
8328098,5,B001NXBZPC,unbelievable footage... i agree with previous reviews regarding the profound bond between the fathers and sons... gripping... an inspirational story... kudos to aderer!,1284595200,,168,6.3478260869565215
8328099,5,B001NXBZPC,"This movie had the best footage of any documentary I have seen on the subject. Aderer was ""fortuitously"" there to capture the apprehension, fear, and at some moments, terror associated with being subject to the overpowering force of nature. The director seamlessly weaves the storm as a metaphor for the turbulent nature of the relationship three brothers have with their father. Highly recommended.",1282608000,,399,5.349206349206349
8328100,5,B001NXBZPC,I have to agree with one of the other reviews for A Corner of Her Eye.  In the end this movie is a documentary is about the relationship between a father and his sons.  The ever increasing danger of the hurricane creates gripping footage but it's a fascination with the father's relationship with his sons that remains with the viewer after the movie is over.,1282348800,,359,4.507692307692308
8328101,5,B001NXBZPC,"This short video gives people who live outside the hurricane zone real insight into what goes on the minds of those who stay (even when they rue that later to some extent). Short answer: for the anarchy, and the bonding that takes place during a crisis. While the water pours into the house, one man's sons stay the course, while he drives from emergency to emergency in the storm. Apparently he was worried about them alone in his house, but left them to their trial by water.

A heartwarming bonding moment in disaster is captured here, not in Hollywood style, but in a much more realistic dynamic between a father and the sons who follow his lead in sitting out Katrina.",1267228800,,673,4.56198347107438
8328102,5,B001NXBZPC,"huge hurricane is coming.  what do you do?  if you're the Aderer brothers, you stay -- and film.  Katrina plays second fiddle to the silent force of Aderer's father.  though he's rarely on camera, his presence is felt throughout, guiding each decision that the three brothers make.  are they trying to prove their manhood? or make dad proud?  are they just crazy?  or a little of everything?  ""A Corner of Her Eye"" includes some jaw-dropping footage of Katrina unlike any documentaries/news coverage i've seen.  hope there's a part two with more on this fascinating family.",1249776000,,573,4.947368421052632
8328103,5,B001NXBZPC,"A fascinating short.  Not only did it provide a look into a unique family dynamic, it also included views of the hurricane most people will never see in real life.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to all documentary junkies.",1248480000,,222,4.815789473684211

8328106,5,B001NXBZPC,"What a powerful story of fathers and sons, and what we ask of each other without truly understanding what we are asking for.  This is a tense drama of a hurricane unfolding, but the true drama is in how the brothers take on their father's challenge to stay in the path of the storm and pull together to survive it.  Highly recommended.",1234137600,,335,4.387096774193548
8328107,5,B001NXBZPC,"This is a great film that, on the surface, is about one family's experience with Hurricane Katrina, but more deeply, about the relationships between fathers and sons, and men in society. Three brothers visit their father in Mississippi and find themselves confronted by physical and emotional storms. A great narrative with arresting first-hand footage of Hurricane Katrina. A must see.",1234051200,2,386,5.45
