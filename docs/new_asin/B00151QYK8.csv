8257044,4,B00151QYK8,"In a devastated world overrun by monstrous bugs and outlaws, Honoka is the protector of the innocent. She has a 6th sense for danger, sword skills that rock, and an A.I. tank that acts as her partner and home. She is ready to take on any job that her clients are willing to pay her for. While crossing the desert, she finds a man wandering alone. This man has a secret, and a mission that will change her life forever. Her skills are about to be tested like never before.

This anime is a lot better than I expected. I has good animation, voice acting, a unique story, and a pretty good soundtrack. There is a lot of action, drama, mystery, adventure, and some pretty interesting characters & plot twists. There isn't another anime out there that I can really compare this to. It's pretty original, despite that, I still found it lacking a little something that would make it a 5 star show. It's hard to put my finger on what it is, but The Third is comes just shy of being incredible. Even so, it's still really good, and definitely worth watching. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1353974400,,1082,4.383084577114428
8257045,3,B00151QYK8,"Every time a series ends they have a choice on what route they can take. In this case though there really was only one route they could take and this was it. While the series always had potential to be different and exciting, the staff never really found their focus and ended up drifting rather aimlessly from one story to the next. In the end they were left with nothing and wrapped things up as neatly as possible and hoped no one would notice. The audience would have to be blind not to notice in this case though and as stated above, have every right to feel a little jilted. If you need closure than you can go ahead and check this one out but the rest of us can really just stop at volume five.",1219881600,,701,4.161764705882353
8257046,4,B00151QYK8,"So, I've already watched this, since AnimeNation is constantly breaking streetdate (even though they're overpriced, I got the 5th volume for $13, so I figured it evened out). But let's get the point - the ending of The Third. There was another episode obviously done by a different animation studio (the second to the last epi), and while it wasn't as good as the usual art, it was better than that ghastly animation on the last disc from what had to be yet another studio.  Well, at least they both only crapped out one episode, so...oh well. Time constraints, probably. The last episode of the series was animated by the normal studio (thank God), so rest easy. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it's not the usual Depressing! Non-Ending that seems to have become the supposedly ""artistic"" cliche for a lot of anime these days. It's a happy ending, and while you don't get to see Honoka get married and have babies or anything, I think they did what they could without looking rushed (or making another season).  That's basically all I have to say. It's worth buying to complete your collection - or, if you're just noticing The Third, buy the whole thing!  I'm sure a boxset will come out soon. It's one of the few anime I've been spending actual money on lately. The other being Mushi-Shi, which is also worth every penny!",1211414400,3,1331,4.584033613445378
