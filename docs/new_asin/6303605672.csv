700045,4,6303605672,"I first saw this film on VHS during my Anthony LaPaglia infatuation. That phase is long over yet this remains one of my top 20 films of all time. I bought it again on DVD and still really love it when I feel like life is kicking me just for the fun of it. What gets me every time is the cat and mouse game fate plays with all the characters.

Anthony LaPaglia has made a career of playing soulful, shopworn Italian-American characters. It's hard to imagine that he's in fact Australian. This role is the epitome of world weary. His character is so far from being alive, it's a wonder he hasn't yet offed himself. He's a careful and therefore successful assassin. Understandably reticent when asked to take a job with ""no prep, no scopeout"", he does so only to honor the request of his friend and business acquaintance. A man used to having, and in fact being the final word, he is stunned into contemplation and action by the woman who is to be killed. He's never met someone so alive and yet so intent on dying. LaPaglia invests his character with first an eerie detachment followed by a growing hope that ends with utter hearbreak. The look on his face in the final scene before the credits is priceless. If your heart doesn't break for him, it should.

Mimi Rogers lends both a perfect calm and worldweariness to her character. It would have been easy for her to come across as bizarre, trite or puzzling. As it is, she pulls off the mix of intent command and detachment. She leaves no doubt how she could inspire the kind of slavish devotion she does. Her will is what drives the piece and it is unbending.

What makes the film amazing is that there are really only 5 characters in the story. The world is fully realized and recognizable but you have the sense that somehow reality left a vaccuum for these 5 people to fill.

If you like noir and are not put off by the fairly intense sex scene in the first half hour, you might just give this hidden gem a try.",1147132800,4,1965,4.360655737704918
700046,5,6303605672,"Anthony LaPaglia is an extremely successful hit man who is hired to whack  Mimi Rogers. Problem is that THIS hit man, way down deep inside, is a  lonely romantic, and is smitten by his mark. If you think you've heard this  one before, think again. Very unusual, very romantic, and a love story that  you will never forget. Mimi also shows us how tough a woman can be.",969062400,12,367,4.352941176470588
700047,4,6303605672,"This haunting film noir melodrama from Canada should be called, simply,""Irony"". When you go back over it afterwards, you'll see all the many little twists and tugs. It requires at least one or two more  goings over to fully appreciate the poetic justices and injustices visited  upon the anti-hero and his fellow night dwellers. Anthony Lapaglia is, as  usual, outstanding, only in a far more restrained vain. His New York/New  Jersey hit-man has ""lost"" his ""way"", as his aging  veteran boss, played by the flawless Peter Boyle, guesses. Young,  good-looking, wealthy, unattached-Mick would seem to have the world by the  tail, if only it weren't for the fact that he kills people for a living and  as of late is having trouble finding meaning in life. He is gotten to the  point, in fact, where he toys with killing for no reason-a dangerous line  for him to cross, as pointed out by George. Experiencing this torment of  the soul after his last hit- a ""fiasco"", where he had to make a  second, successful attempt on the mark-George nonethless begs him to do a  hit that same night on a woman for whom George has come to feel extreme  affection. (You'll find out why.) Mick reluctantly agrees, bringing along  his loose cannon of a best friend, played with whiny innocence by that  adorable goof, Matt Craven. Now for the first big twist: the edgy woman,  played with uniquely approachable, very real glamour by Mimi Rogers, knows  its coming,and has resigned herself to it. In fact, as we find out, she  wants to die. You'll have to see it to find out why. When you realize what  is going on, your heart will go thump. This goes from quirky film noir to  Shakespeare in one deft moment during a most unusual picnic. The story and  cast take this film to a conclusion that is sure to shock you, but  shouldn't really surprise you. You'll see the nifty clues director Mark  Malone has scattered throughout the flick upon later viewings. As warned by  others, take the video all the way through past the final credits to the  epilogue. The lesson will hit you full in the face, and probably disturb  your sleep that night.",961545600,17,2121,4.646900269541779
700048,5,6303605672,"It's been awhile since I've seen this movie, but I still remember the way that it hit me quite vividly... This movie stands out in my mind because of the depth with which the main characters are played.  Both Anthony LaPaglia and Mimi Rogers do a superb job in their parts... LaPaglia as the hitman with a heart, and Rogers as the woman awaiting death.  Both of them are caught in such hopeless lives, and their methods of dealing with them are heartbreaking to watch...
This is one of those films where the characters grab you, and for some strange reason you feel like you can understand them, despite all the seeming differences... This movie will haunt you if you let it.",946684800,10,675,4.524590163934426
700049,4,6303605672,"tough story, tough characters, fine performances..
most of the people probably watched this movie because of the headliners in the cast. i was drawn by mimi rogers but the first(and hardest) kick was the  ""supporting act"" by Monika Schnarre as Laura.
i caught myself  waiting for her to appear again, but.... that's life.
i wish some casting  gurus read this and check her out, so we are not far away from seeing more  of her.
honestly, she ""made"" this movie for me....",937180800,,469,4.682926829268292
700050,5,6303605672,"This is one that seems to have slipped under the radar, yet is one of the most unusual, moving, films of its genre. Anthony LaPaglia, who's played mob hitmen before, subtly adds an intriguing twist to his usual fine  performances. Mimi Rogers, another underappreciated talent, like LaPaglia,  who even reduced Rush Limbaugh to speechlessness, portrays an icy beauty  who knows full well how she is able to influence men. She just can't turn  it off. The Noir influence here touches everything, even the actors who all  wear an ironic, world-weary mask, down to the cryptic title cards. Even the  opening song, ""Love is all Around"" used more sentimentally in  ""4 Weddings and a Funeral"" is a deadpan anthem to characters who  long since stopped feeling anything. Why does Mick fall for Fiona, despite  having been on 'jobs' before? It can't be just the sex scene, although  interesting for the power exchange. Is Fiona so vulnerable? Once her secret  is revealed it would appear that way. Just watch the moment in the  warehouse when she whispers in Archie's ear. What about Archie, the  bumbling, would-be assistant? The movie seems to hinge on what should be  done, needs to be done, as when Fiona begs a trembling Mick ""Be brave  for me, my darling,"" and Archie crowing ""I'm a guy"" are for  all the wrong reasons. The climax is shocking enough, but the coda, rolling  after the final credits, will have  you creeped out for days.",937008000,12,1431,4.795081967213115

700247,5,6303605672,"(9/5/14) It is probably not cool to give such high respect to this kind of film, but for the sake of honesty, what an Amazing Movie!  The best part of this movie by far is that it gives you a sense of meaning, without specifying exactly how you relate that meaning to your own life.  Offers something legit and just backs off to let you, make of it, what you will.  It is soooo sad that so many movies these days have to leave an unconclusive ending for producers, writers. directors..( i dunno actors, movie viewers) to feel relevant.  A GOOD movie can give you an ending and still not mess up its merit and this movie pulls that off.  Giving this movie the label of ""romantic movie"" is a slap in the face, it can be viewed that way, but it really isn't a romantic movie... its like saying any movie where the main character is married or dating is a romantic movie, nor is it a ""gangster movie"" this is a crime drama or a crime thriller.  I see netflix slap on loads of unneccissary genres for movies all the time I guess i can forgive that, but accurately this is a crime thriller or crime drama non of the members in this movie are even in a gang. (amazon also called this movie romantic although it did not slap the gangster movie genre on this)

EDIT: I see someone on amazon write it is a noir film, I am not sure if it is technically a noir film but the main character is not narrating the story and nor is it in black & white,  my point being if you usually do not like noirs, like me, do not let that description from other reviews scare you from watching this film.",1409875200,,1576,4.161184210526316

In other places it drags and I was tempted to turn it off. Twisted story plot, you have a bookie, (Peter Boyle) that is in love with the lady he just took a hit out on. Then you have the hit man, (LaPaglia) falling in love with the mark, (Driver). In which you have the hit man driving around all night with his associate trying to figure out who's going to kill her and when, and finally in the end she is done away with. Like I said a twisted plot, watch without any distractions so you can keep up with this dry movie. Give it overall three rating.",1407974400,,674,4.037313432835821
700313,4,6303605672,"Young and pretty  and THIN Anthony Lapaglia  was menacing and fragile.  Beautiful Ms. Rogers is rightfully confusing and the dialogue became almost believable being carried along with their performances.  I'm guessing the sidekick was meant for comic relief but he became distracting, almost slapstick.  I couldn't figure out what a cool but crazy cuckoo guy like LaPaglia's character would be doing with a kid that brought him to the brink of folly every time the kid talked or breathed.  Otherwise, it was a good, unusual, and well-acted picture.",1404432000,,548,5.170454545454546

700315,4,6303605672,"I almost didn't watch this because of the cover photo and title -- it just seemed so corny!  (Its alternate title was ""Killer"", which would've been slightly better).  However it was free to stream through Prime, so nothing to lose.  It actually turned out to be pretty riveting, thanks mostly to LaPaglia...I never realized before how good an actor he is.  He's one of the best at conveying emotion solely through his facial expressions, and he gives the character of Mick a lot more depth than first appears.  I wish more of his work was available in the U.S. besides the type-cast Goomba mobster/cop roles we usually see him in over here.

Rodgers' Fiona comes off as annoyingly glib and smug at first, but we soon see that's just a front she puts up to hide her desperation.  I must say her ultra-quick seduction of the supposedly emotionally-dead Mick felt a little false, but that would be the fault of the writer/director/editor(s).  The other 2 main actors are decent, doing their best in somewhat superfluous roles featuring an odd comedic bent.  Herein lies the quirk -- somehow this humor manages to work (mostly) and helps alleviate the otherwise grim theme.

If you pay attention and look beyond the surface, you start to wonder who's really calling the shots in this show, which is a nice twist.  There were a few moments/lines that lived up to the cover photo and made me groan like bad puns do.  I wish there had been less arguing/pleading between Mick, his boss and his partner, and more development of some of the subplots (Fionas' reason for wanting to die, Mick's life after the ending, etc).  But overall I found this little film noir quite charming, if also quite sad.  But I like dark sad stories if they're done well, and this one held my attention till the end.",1403913600,,1785,4.661341853035144
700316,4,6303605672,"This unforgettable tragedy of a mob killer's stab at love is a glossy and gritty glimpse of redemption that's the only heaven he'll ever know, if the cruel cost is not too great to bear.

Anthony LaPaglia is a hardcore hitman, true to his code and without remorse. His cold heart is bulletproof, allowing no attachments, no desire, no regret. Feeling nothing is a professional necessity grown strong in his empty world, until he finds himself deep in the abyss. His contract tonight is a glittering socialite.

Mimi Rogers is the glamorous woman whose endless round of parties and people celebrating their success and renown cannot fill her deeply felt emptiness that prevents all attempts to connect, hope, or move on. Her inability to resolve the pain of this void has led her to attempt suicide several times, without success. So, unbeknown to the hitman, she's put this hit on herself.

When LaPaglia comes to do the job, Rogers is in the midst of old friends, throwing a big party. Only she knows it's a going away party. She reveals that to him and her role as client and target, then proposes that they take a last ride around the city. His surprise at the contrary situation and her relief at soon dying, invite for both the first possibility of interest, in a very long time.

Each also finds the other attractively attuned in thought, views on life, and conduct. Their yearning for  salvation in each other kindles so deftly and naturally that you wish desperately for a reprieve, Here are knowing portrayals of that classy, real tough kind of heartbreak. Despite a sunrise deadline on this revealing interlude from ceaseless desolation for two souls lost to the dark, the chemistry between LaPaglia and Rogers makes their recognition so right, so magnetic, so moving that you hope nevertheless. You really hope their newly found accord can save them, even though the death she's bought cannot be stopped.

That's why their fates remain fixed, although they've changed each other. So, Rogers expresses no will for reprieve, and LaPaglia, none for deviation from his duty. Their driver is relieved to arrive just in time at the warehouse where the most important death for either one will claim one as sacrifice. If you wait for the credits to finish, you'll see how it claims the other, even in  life.

I can understand why this film never found its audience. Although a great romance, it's no romcom. Although tough as adamantine, there's no goodfella here. Although a classic tragedy, it's not Masterpiece Theatre. It's just a forgotten movie that stuns me every time with its insight, acting, and pathos and makes me wish that Anthony LaPaglia and Mimi Rogers had gotten more good roles.

What I can't understand is why Amazon would allow such a lazy, crass comment for its editorial review.",1394323200,3,2804,4.849372384937238

Totally taken over by the movie soundtrack.

My main interest for buying the DVD was mainly for the music score, I tried to purchase just the music score and was unable to find it for purchase, any help from anyone??  Please!
