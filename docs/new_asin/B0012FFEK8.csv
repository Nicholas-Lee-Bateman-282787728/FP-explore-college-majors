8245787,2,B0012FFEK8,"If you want an Aquarium on you TV then this is for you.

Was a bit boring for me after watching Reefscapes.",1301270400,,107,3.8636363636363638
8245788,5,B0012FFEK8,"DVD has three different tanks (exotic goldfish, tropical, fresh water), each with a choice of aquarium noise or relaxing new age music/sounds. Fills entire TV screen. If you just let it go, it switches tanks and then loops back to whichever tank you started on. Note that you use the AUDIO button on the remote to change audio after you've started a tank. My 2 and 3-year-old niece and nephew really enjoy watching the fish, naming them, and making up stories about them. I find it nice company when I'm reading.",1209772800,9,512,4.637362637362638
8245789,5,B0012FFEK8,"A friend of mine had this DVD playing at his house. He said it was recommended as a tool for lowering blood pressure. I honestly never heard of using something like this for medical reasons but he seems to enjoy it so maybe it's working. I was unaware that there are so many of these type of ""virtual"" videos, fireplaces, fish, dogs etc. I was also very surprised to find how serious everyone takes these things, something that I would consider a ""gag gift"" in most cases. I'm no expert in the virtual aquarium world, I don't know what I should or shouldn't expect or how this DVD is better or worse than the others in the world of faux fish, but to me it looks like a video of a few fish tanks, nothing more or less. Play the video, look at fish, kids stare and point at things and have a good time.... that's about it. C'mon people, it's a video of a fish tank and it's what people are getting from me when their virtual fireplace has run it's course.",1208822400,3,953,4.213114754098361
8245790,1,B0012FFEK8,"I second the previous review, ""The film quality is low, nothing is in focus, and the lighting is poor. I would not purchase this item again.""  Big disappointment.",1208390400,3,162,4.785714285714286
8245791,1,B0012FFEK8,"Get one that is filmed in the ocean not a tank.  The film quality is low, nothing is in focus, and the lighting is poor.  I would not purchase this item again.",1207526400,5,159,3.9375
8245792,5,B0012FFEK8,"When I first played this DVD my kids thought I was kidding, now they request to put it on when we eat dinner, and play board games. This is very relaxing and friends find themselves watching it when they come over to visit. This is great background mood enhancing DVD that I recommend to everyone.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aquarium-Widescreen-DVD-Coral-Reef-Saltwater-and-Freshwater-Fish-Tank-Virtual-Experience/dp/B0012FFEK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aquarium Widescreen DVD - Coral Reef, Saltwater and Freshwater Fish Tank Virtual Experience</a>",1205280000,5,592,7.4714285714285715
