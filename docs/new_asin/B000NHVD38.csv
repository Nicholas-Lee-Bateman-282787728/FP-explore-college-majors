8177707,3,B000NHVD38,"Most of DVD #1 has a wonderful description and tour of the fair. After that there is hour after hour of what looks like silent home movies taken by several different cameras. Sure, we eventually see every nook and cranny of every building, but it does get boring after a while. It would have helped immensely to have background music and an announcer to explain what we're seeing.",1426464000,3,380,4.602941176470588

8177710,5,B000NHVD38,"I liked seeing the history of the 1939 New York World's Fair, which happened before I was born. The original filming was done,  most likely with 16mm color film, of the period. The colors in the film were fairly good, considering the age for the film. The men and women attending the fair seemed wear mostly black and dark brown suits and dresses.
The first disc spent a lot of its time viewing the General Motors highways of the future in an large model. The rural parts of the highways were a lot like our current freeways with interchanges. The highways in cities were on a lower level, while sidewalks were on an upper level.
The first disc and the second through forth discs also had outdoor views of other exhibit buildings, the fair grounds, and views of various water jets and ponds and outside views of other countries buildings.
There were also some sideshow exhibits, some which showed partial female nudity.",1361664000,,919,4.672839506172839
