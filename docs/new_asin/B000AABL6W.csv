8076980,3,B000AABL6W,"This 92-minute History Channel documentary (packaged as usual in a DVD that contains only ""play"" and chapter stops) purports to look at the historical basis of Biblical disasters, but spends an inordinate amount of time exploring the religious and scientific responses to modern-day disasters like tornadoes and floods. Visuals consist entirely of modern-day footage of natural disasters mixed with still photographs of religious paintings. There are not even any re-enactments or recreations here, as has since become typical in History Channel videos.

The documentary itself appears to have been filmed in the 1990s and contains some nice photography of the National Geographic variety. It's just a bit dull and off-topic. The style is clear as soon as it opens on an unidentified white-haired man introducing the program's treatment of the Bible as a historical document. Unfortunately, it doesn't stick to that topic, but throws in all sorts of stuff about the Big Bang and modern ecosystems before working its way back to Biblical accounts like that of the Red Sea crossing. Then we get a lot of naturalists talking about things like locusts, yet no archeologists or biblical scholars or historians to unpack the Biblical text itself. We even get silly stuff about Mormons and ""Mormon crickets,"" but it takes a long time for the film to get to actual scientific evidence for events described in the Bible.

Rather than limiting itself to an historical take on Biblical disasters like the great flood and destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the video strains too hard to make connections to contemporary life, padding the running time of what could have easily been a 60-minute video instead of 90 minutes. It's good information presented in a substantive fashion, avoiding any major potshots (other than one howler that medieval Catholics used excommunication as a weapon against locusts!) at religious believers, but the video itself  is done in a quite dated fashion despite the more recent DVD release date. It's probably suitable for adult religion classes, but current generations of young people will find the static imagery quite dull if they don't have a pre-existing enthusiasm for this material.",1394150400,,2210,5.237288135593221
8076981,4,B000AABL6W,"This is very good for anybody who wants an insight in ancient biblical society and undersrtand their worldview. In response to the previous reviewer who states that this documentray was anti-god, well, any form of rational thought can be anti-god. Are we supposed  to beleive in the supernatural explanation of ancient people and take them for fact? Are we suppose to just accept that God or supernatural being was beign those disasters? The ancient greeks had their own supernatural explanations for their own disastrous events, can we all take them as fact too? This is the 21st century, we should be above those sillyness.",1262822400,7,625,5.009615384615385
8076982,5,B000AABL6W,"This is a great show that tries to show how some parts of the bible may be based on actual events in some of its stories.  Have to remember that those that wrote the many stories that were later put together into a collection called the bible were that of primitive people who lacked most of the knowledge we have today.  Back then anything unexplained was the work of gods or demons.

Another show called Banned from the bible shows many of the stories that were removed or never made it into the collection called the bible.

I find it funny that some people get upset when anything is questioned in the bible.",1234742400,7,612,4.389380530973451
8076983,1,B000AABL6W,"The documentary appears to be pro-Bible and pro-Christian at first. There is a man in the beginning of the DVD who says they view the Bible as an historical document. But as you watch the program, you realize that the documentary, although ""pro""-Bible (as an historical book, and nothing more), is anti-God. The entire program is about explaining that the disasters in the bible did indeed happen, but try to convince you that they happened naturally (ie: without God). They even go so far as to say that the authors of the Bible stole stories, and that they incorporated God into certain ""tales"" that ""most likely"" happened ""naturally"", without God. They clearly don't believe in the Divine Inspiration of the Scriptures.

The back of the DVD, which is not what's listed in the Amazon description, says that they reinterpret the Bible (their private interpretation) with a ""scientific"" point of view and separate it from the so-called ""religious agenda"". I guess the program is good for Christians who have a very strong faith and would like to see how some scientists explain certain stories in the Bible. But be warned that it's typical History Channel propaganda.",1203984000,17,1167,4.984615384615385
