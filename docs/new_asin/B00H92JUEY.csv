6141923,4,B00H92JUEY,"This is violent and visually upsetting from the get go. Heli is a car factory worker in a rural part of Mexico - newly married he has a baby and lives with his father and younger sister in a cinderblock house, but they all seem to have a degree of happiness based on love for one another.

His sister has met a young police cadet called Beto who is courting her and her lack of years and or experience lead her to make a decision that will see her whole family become embroiled in the world of drugs and violence that blight so many communities across the World.

This film does not pull its punches and often seems to dwell on the nastier side of life, there are scenes of torture too and it is far from a comfortable watch. The music is minimalist which strangely lends itself to making you concentrate on the on screen happenings even more. The whole thing is beautifully shot and directed with a cast of mainly non actors doing a superb job. This won the best director slot at Cannes and it is easy to see why. Because of the subject matter some people will not like this at all and it is certainly a film that would be hard to say `I love it', however it is always pretty clear when you are confronted with a work of talent and this most certainly is.",1411171200,5,1256,4.20746887966805
6141924,5,B00H92JUEY,"This is a strong film about how innocent lives--law-abiding citizens--in Mexico are arbitrarily absorbed into the narco-violence currently stretching throughout Mexico. The film was produced and directed independently but with some funding from the Mexican cinematic institutions. The film follows Heli, a young 19 year old law-abiding citizen who works in a manufacturing plant (maquiladora) in a nearby city. He lives in a small town with his wife, a son, his younger teenage sister (middle-school) and his father who also works at the plant. Through no fault of his own his entire family is absorbed into the corrupted violence of the Mexican marines (a government institution) and hence narco-violence. Heli is forced to seek justice albeit cautiously. The entire film keeps the sociolinguistics of a low-income, low-educated, and rural family real, as well as the struggles of low-opportunity socioeconomics realistic. This film won Best Director at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival--the award was awarded by Steven Spielberg. An excellent film worth watching and analyzing.",1406678400,2,1083,5.609756097560975
