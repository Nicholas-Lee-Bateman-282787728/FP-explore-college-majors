Balance immediately improved and has helped in all activities. Bought many other of them in this series, and while people commented about cost , I truly say, very worth it.

6444341,5,B00KQYHPXU,"I am a long-term lover of ballet, but as a practitioner I am an adult beginner, with absolutely no prior experience. Like the recent reviewer (see Mark Bayuk's review), I have checked and researched what was available online and public library. Originally, I was NOT really going to buy the DVD by Finis Jhung - mainly because of the price (I am a student, and I don't usually spend $40 on a single DVD).  However, upon reviewing other beginners DVD options and looking at Finis's website, watching the clips of his various DVDs and reading reviews, I made a decision to take the risk.

The short story: Within a month of starting to work with this DVD, I invested in another one - that is how much I have grown in my esteem of Finis's teaching.

The longer story:

TEACHER: Finis is a very knowledgeable and gifted teacher:
- not only does he explain each position, exercise, and how it supposed to feel, but he also coaches you on the potential mistakes and what to watch out for in the mirror
- while he teaches one exercise, he simultaneously builds into it small fragments of the ""things to come"" (e.g., turning your head to prepare for spotting, taking a balance)
- even though he is a professional dancer, he seems to have a genuine passion for sharing this art with ordinary people and a remarkable understanding of how complex ballet movements could be best explained to absolute beginners
- he has acute attention to detail: like that of a bonsai gardener, except with regards to the human body
- and his dry wit will make you chuckle along as you practice.

RESULTS:
- after one (!) time of practice with this DVD, my regular ballet teacher remarked that I have ""remarkably strong plies for a beginner"" (this is because Finis has his own unique way of explaining plie!)
- after two weeks of practicing with this DVD, my regular ballet teacher said that I ""really got the spotting""
- now, at the end of the second month, I have lost almost all ""wobbling"" when on demi-pointe. I feel stronger and can follow my regular ballet classes with greater confidence and ease. (I also notice that I am becoming stronger and have greater balance in my daily activities.)
- An unexpected but very welcome result is mental/emotional: I feel very relaxed after practicing with this DVD.

NOTE FOR PRACTICE: it really is best to practice with a barre, and in front of the mirror.

I would recommend this DVD, with great enthusiasm, to all adult beginners!",1459036800,33,2450,4.618390804597701
6444342,5,B00KQYHPXU,"At 66 I am just starting to study Ballet. I have no previous music or dance training to draw on. After considerable reading of beginning ballet material in books and online, I discovered that four beginner ballet videos or teacher videos were repeatedly recommended: any DVD by Finis Jhung - I selected Ballet Barre for the Adult Absolute Beginner  by Finis Jhung with dancer Sachiko Kanai- 2014 DVD; Ballet Class for Beginners with David Howard- 1982 VHS/DVD; Ballet Workout by Melissa Lowe 1984 VHS/DVD; and  Ballet 101, A Beginners Class by Jennifer Nunes- VHS/DVD 1997.  I read that any Finis Jhung DVD is pricey compared to the rest and are virtually never found online for sale at a discount.
I purchased all four of these programs from Amazon in DVD format.
I find that Finis Jhung's DVD is by far the best teaching choice for the true adult beginner!
My analysis starts outside working in.
First jacket information. The Finis Jhung DVD has a detailed list and individual description of each of 18 exercises  with time and tempo on the jacket cover. For example: ""8. Pointe tendu Music New Ballet Music 9, Track 6, 4/4 adagio"". None of the the other three DVDs have any listing of tracks on the jacket cover. Nor was any insert placed with within the jacket to provide a listing or description of the tracks.
I feel that Finis is directly and most successfully targeting the new Adult Ballet Beginner Student. The others are not at all that target adult ballet audience specific.
Finis has been teaching ballet since 1972, but he is still very active into the present in improving  and upgrading every aspect of his teaching DVDs! He uses  the most  advanced modern individual track searching techniques and contemporary ballet dancers. I found that the dancer in this DVD, Sachiko Kanai, only started working with Finis in 2010.  It is very easy to very quickly search and find any individual track on his DVD. This and the informative jacket information are the first inklings for me to understand why Finis's more expensive teaching DVD will be worth the price! The other three DVDs I purchased and viewed were originally  recorded in VHS format in the 80's and 90's, and then apparently transferred directly into DVD format without any updating of material. None of the DVDs had technical improvements in individual track accessibility equal to the refinements in Finis's DVD.
Finis teaches in the program himself and he really teaches! He tells you what the reason is for having ""knees bent"" or ""ears up"" or always trying to be ""in number one'.  In his quietly supportive and confident speaking style, Finis tells you the reason why you have to make a  specific movement in a specific manner.
After purchasing and viewing four different teaching system introductory ballet DVDs. I come to the conclusion that the The Finis Jhung program is the only one of the four that I can see is technically and actively supported in the present by the originating artist. And It is updated new today for the target audience I absolutely belong too- The Adult Absolute Beginner!
The Finis Jhung Ballet Barre for the Adult Absolute Beginner DVD  does indeed cost more than any of the other three introductory ballet DVDs I purchased on Amazon and viewed.  But it is by far the best prescription and the most effective DVD teaching remedy for any true at home adult beginner ballet student!",1454371200,106,3387,4.818965517241379

6444346,5,B00KQYHPXU,"Finis Jhung's way of teaching a plie is absolutely revolutionary.  His focus on correct weight placement is the foundation of supple movement.  This is a much better class in an easier format than his older absolute beginner barre DVD and I could not recommend it enough; even a highly experienced dancer should consider taking this class at least once and beginning to unlearn some of the bad habits that, while they look good in the mirror, inhibit the dance and frustrate the dancer.  I was taught by some of the best, but I'm so sad they didn't teach like Finis!",1428105600,31,566,4.64

8660899,5,B00KQYHPXU,"I'm in my 50's and have danced for fun and exercise since college. For years, my go-to favorites have been Kries' ""New Body Ballet"", Lowe's ""The Ballet Workout"" and Argo's ""The Anti-Aging Method."" Needing a change, I ordered ""Ballet Class for the Adult Absolute Beginner"" and loved it right away because it engages my mind. Finis Jhung explains the movements and helps you understand why each is important. I use a portable VitaVibe 4' barre to do the 18 exercises then the brief floor work. The sessions can be played with or without instruction and the exercises can be played one by one. Jhung even explains how best to hold your arms which I've always wanted to know (Exercise #6). The music is peaceful & unintrusive. This DVD has the detailed type of instruction I'd been craving---longer, focused, and helpful in improving my balance. I also have ""Beginner Ballet Barre"" and am looking forward to the third in the series ""Ballet Barre Stretch & Strength."" Mr. Jhung suggests in ""Beginner Ballet Barre"" to do this DVD ""Adult Absolute Beginner"" first. I would agree because ""Beginner Ballet Barre"" appears to have more complicated exercises, also well-explained. Very pleased with my purchase.",1510963200,13,1198,4.995

8660901,5,B00KQYHPXU,"I'm almost 70 and have never done ballet in my life. This DVD is perfect for a total beginner. I only wish I had a barre. I've tried chairs, the bookcases -- even the baseboard on my bed. Not the greatest solution  . . . BUT Finis Jung is an incredible teacher. He is thorough, informative and throws in a little humor just when you realize that you forgot to breathe. I can't imagine a better DVD for a total beginner who really wants to do the postures correctly.",1502150400,5,465,4.224719101123595

8660903,5,B00KQYHPXU,"Simply the best.

Here is my story--and one you might relate to...  I am 69 years old--in pretty good shape. I work out on the treadmill. Do machine-weight workouts. I take walks. I dance to music around the house. Nothing major or heavy duty. I am stiff in the knees, hips, and back. I wanted to add something to my workout routine to help combat the stiffness. Yoga and pilates are nice but I wanted to try something different--and ballet was something I always longed to do since childhood. I love the idea of ballet--the music, the art, the discipline, the whole package.

This fall, I attended ballet classes at my workout facility. Turns out it was an advanced class--not a good match for my skill level but it was a start/an intro. I attended about six sessions. Two takeaways from the experience: 1) Ballet is right for me. 2) Finding an appropriate instructor/class is a key requirement and worth the search. But what to do? I searched for local beginner-level classes. Nothing jumped out at me in terms of offerings and/or scheduling. I also began searching on YouTube for beginning ballet videos. I found a few...some good...but alas, nothing that really suited. Then...and much to amazement...I found Finis Jhung.

I purchased this DVD in December 2016. It is excellent. Perfect for my needs. Finis Jhung is my kind of teacher. His approach is sensible, clear, and it works for me. My balance is improving--immediate benefit. The stretches are helping achieve more flexibility--a slow process to be sure but at least I have a way forward. The arm and leg work are making me stronger--again, a slow process. My posture is improving--immediate benefit. I self-correct my posture during the day and find I do it naturally--not forced. Overall, I feel more body/brain connected. Although the DVD price is not inexpensive, in value terms (for me) it is worth the price.

I do wish Mr. Jhung would stream classes on ROKU as well as offer his DVD collection via Amazon instant video.",1483660800,18,1988,4.818181818181818
8660904,5,B00KQYHPXU,"An absolutely exceptional instructional DVD for ballet.  First of all, I have always wanted to take ballet but didn't have the money when I was growing up. Finally now as an adult I have (sort of) the time to finally take some adult classes. It is not easy to find the time to make it to classes every week due to my kids' sports schedules so I turned to finding some DVDs to help me practice ballet at home.  I am very thankful to have found these DVDs.  Finis is an excellent teacher and it's nice that I can rewind and replay a segment to ""get it right"" as many times as I need to.  He has taught me more things than my teacher has in class though I do like my teacher too.  I have realized that I was doing certain steps wrong and I'm finally understanding the importance of the pli.  I only wish I lived in New York City so I could attend his live classes. Now that would be a dream come true!",1481760000,4,898,4.045197740112994
8660905,5,B00KQYHPXU,"Finis Jhung has been teaching ballet since the 1970s and it shows. His expertise is quite obvious in this DVD, as he a true master at explaining the techniques behind every movement. I would say this video is the #1 at-home tool for someone just beginning to study the art of ballet.",1481760000,5,283,4.461538461538462
