5186682,1,B008WAM2PG,"I eagerly awaited the debut of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winged-Seduction-Birds-of-Paradise/dp/B008WAM2PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winged Seduction: Birds of Paradise</a>.  With its promise to document all 39 species, it was certain to be a remarkable documentary, and I couldn't wait to add it to my collection.  Fortunately, I actually watched the program on television before purchasing the DVD, and I am so glad I did. It came right off my Christmas wish list.

Suffice it to say, I was bitterly disappointed by this documentary.  It felt rather as if a couple of junior high school students had been transported to New Guinea and given high-tech equipment with which to try and record the activities of some of the most beautiful birds on earth.  The entire program seemed to be much more about the quest of the men than it was about the birds themselves.  I was left wondering why the National Geographic would be associated with such a poorly-executed project.  Some of the images were lovely, but there was just no substance.

As others have noted, in no way did the makers of this program document all 39 species (unless they are counting the product description as ""documentation."")  I have no idea where that claim came from or how they thought it could be made, but this sloppy film really did not do what it promised.  I did not learn much of anything, and I was absolutely open to learning anything this program could teach me.  I will never go to New Guinea and I hang on every moment of film available of these magical birds.  But between the ridiculous commentary and the jumpy, MTV-style quick editing, this documentary simply did not have anything to offer to the body of work about the Birds of Paradise.

I know that there are some complaints by a few reviewers about coverage of humans rather than exclusive focus on birds in David Attenborough's program&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-Birds-of-the-Gods/dp/B004CRR9FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature: Birds of the Gods</a>, but I first came to know about the birds because of that show and I love it.  (I found that program to be truly exceptional, and a brilliant representation of the ecosystem of the birds -- which includes humans.)  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about these remarkable, glorious birds.  I also greatly enjoyed the segments on the birds in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attenborough-in-Paradise-and-Other-Personal-Voyages/dp/B000R7I4A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attenborough in Paradise and Other Personal Voyages</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-of-Birds/dp/B000069HXL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life of Birds</a>.

Unfortunately, I did not enjoy Winged Seduction in the slightest, and did not bother saving the recorded program on my DVR -- that's how bad it is.

Amazon will probably correct this error soon, but before you buy this disk based on what you think is a positive review of the documentary, just make sure that it's actually about the DVD.)",1354233600,28,3299,5.79296066252588
5186683,1,B008WAM2PG,"First of all, since the reviews for the book and the DVD seem to be mixed together, I just want to make it clear that this review is for the DVD, and not the book, which I haven't seen yet.

I was extremely excited to see this DVD, having followed some of the ""behind the scenes"" from the Cornell website building up for this release. But I was equally disappointed when I got my DVD today. Birds of Paradise are some of the most impressive and amazing birds alive, but they are not the star of this video - the researchers are. The vast majority of footage time shows them moving around and facing field hardship, interspersed by short clips of the actual birds.

Also, don't be fooled by the ""Includes all 39 species!"" claims on the product description (and even on a DVD box sticker). The researchers probably have it, but it's not in the DVD. The DVD only shows videos of 2 species doing their displays (excluding the several 3-5 second clips thrown here and there with little to no information), 3 if you include the Manucode. Even the photo gallery included in the extras only has photos of about 12 species.

So, yeah... very, very disappointed, and feeling a bit scammed for the fake ""all 39 species"" advertisement. I'd recommend skipping this one.",1354060800,50,1256,4.548672566371682
5186684,2,B008WAM2PG,"I was surprised to read so many good reviews of the DVD I just watched when I realized the reviews were about the book, which BTW is excellent. I am reviewing the DVD I just received yesterday and all I can say is what a waste. The film had to much footage on the gentlemen who took the shots and video and not enough footage of the birds themselves. This film which had great potential of sharing the displays and behaviors of these beautiful birds, actually focused more on the photographer, and videographer getting theses great shots. If you want to see a better documentary on birds (in general) I hight recommend  ""The Life of Birds"". Granted there are more DVDs (It was a BBC series), but if you were to compare just one episode of The Life Of Birds"" with the ""Birds Of Paradise""  you will find much more info, focus, and footage on the birds, and less on the people who got the shots.

Bravo to the two gentlemen who got the beautiful shots.
The editor of this film, well.......... I won't go there.",1354060800,18,1007,4.403225806451613
5186695,2,B008WAM2PG,"The DVD title is accurate - it ""seduces"" you into buying a film that is less about these amazing birds, and more about the challenges of filming such an ambitious project. Not that the ""making of"" aspect isn't interesting, but if you bought it for the birds, you'll come away hungry. It really should have been a two-part set: one focusing on the filming challenges, and the other focusing on the birds. I spoke with the Cornell people about it, who said that if one wants more, there's lots of additional bird footage on their site (http://www.birdsofparadiseproject.org/), however they know of no plans to make additional DVD's.

If there weren't a plethora of nature documentaries on the market, the ""making of"" part would have been more intriguing, but how many times can you watch filmmakers bouncing up and down in raging rivers and slogging through muddy jungles? It's gotten to where the scenes are almost interchangeable. Not so for the birds...absolutely incredible! Hey NatGeo...how about a follow-up DVD?!",1419811200,,1017,5.053571428571429

5186697,2,B008WAM2PG,Others have made the criticisms for this film; the focus is on the film makers and the birds run a poor [if occasionally] spectacular second. The narrative used 'digital explorers surviving the dangerous jungle bit' seems to be mostly hyperbole. Yes they faced choppy water in a boat and yes it rained [it is a rainforest] and yes they used a helicopter to land on a ridge [which the dry Aussie pilot claimed was 'almost too easy'] but old school explorers they are probably not. Too little focus on the wonderful birds of paradise and nothing at all on the other [almost equally speccie] wild life possible within New Guinea. I was hoping for some extra features where one could explore the birds but alas there was nothing like that.,1408320000,,735,4.661538461538462

5186704,3,B008WAM2PG,"We went to the Birds of Paradise exhibit at the National Geographic Museum, and we liked the movie they showed there so much that we purchased the DVD at full price for my parents.  The problem is, this is not the same movie.  This one is, as many have commented, about the researchers more than about the birds.  It's still a nice DVD, but it's absolutely not what I expected, and I would not have paid $25 for it had I known.  This movie is nice to watch once, but I wouldn't pay to own it, as I doubt we'll revisit it.

The movie(s) they showed at the exhibit would definitely have been worth the $25, but where are they?  Seems as if they are keeping it closely guarded for some reason.

I kept thinking throughout the movie how someone planned this whole thing out to spotlight the researchers.  They had at least as many cameras trained on the researchers as they had on the birds.

Seeing the actual DVD made us feel cheated, as we saw the real thing, and we all thought that was what we had bought.  It's location at the end of the exhibit made us think it was what we had just seen.  Somewhat deceptive of them.

In summary, it is interesting and informative about giving a taste of what the researchers did, but it is Not about the birds, and it is not the movie(s) they showed at the National Geographic Museum.

5186721,2,B008WAM2PG,"Very, very disappointing. The DVD advertise ""other"" DVD's for sale eg Joubert's leopard etc.  At least 10 min is wasted on this and I believe this is not appropriate doing so.  Then when you get to the ""Birds of Paradise"" you have to watch the 2 guys fiddling around with camera set-ups, hoisting themselves up in the tree (2x) etc etc.  Expectations from the title didn't realise. Only a few exquisite images were shown. The price doesn't justify buying this DVD.

When compared this with eg the BBC's ""The Greatest Wildlife Show on Earth""  or ""The Frozen Planet"" there is no comparison whatsoever.

If you follow the Bird of Paradise website and read the book you will find this to be a great companion to your understanding of the research and phyical exertion that was part of this adventure. I wasn't disappointed in not seeing each bird because to me the intent of the film is to give a ""snap shot"" of what was done in the field, which I found very interesting.

5186727,5,B008WAM2PG,"Despite reviews that indicated this DVD didn't meet some reviewers' expectations, I thought it was an amazing account of groundbreaking research into the mysteries of the diverse birds of paradise. I agree that perhaps more coverage of all of the 39 species, and greater insights into the whys and hows of their plumages and displays could have been included in this DVD, but that could all be left for sequels to follow. I think perhaps one reviewer is right in that National Geographic is perhaps at fault in their marketing of the program. I highly recommend that interested reviewers join the Cornell Lab of Ornithology; subscribe to their monthly e-mail newsletters; take the online Courtship and Rivalry in Birds course; and check out the online Birds of Paradise project website. The project website is especially helpful in detailing explanations for some of the display behaviors and many other aspects of the research.

They didn't actually show a lot of different birds, the way it should have, and what birds they did feature were shown over and over quite a lot.

But you know what they say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Others' reviews are spot on; this documentary was given a sexy title to lure you in but focuses on the efforts of two men, Tim Laman and Ed Scholes, not the unique behaviors and diversity of this family (though three species are highlighted). To those interested, here are some details and other keys points of concern I had with this documentary:

-There are 5 manucode species, only 1 is shown (curl-crested manucode)
-There are 7 species in the Paradisaea genus, but only the greater and Goldie's BOP's were highlighted, with others shown either briefly or not at all.
-There are 5 parotia species, 2 are shown on film (highlighting only one, Wayne's parotia and showing Carola's briefly a couple times), with the others shown in photographs for a split second as you are told there are 5 species, leading you to think they will be showing them all as the documentary unfolds.
-There are 4 sicklebill species, 1 is shown briefly (black sicklebill)
-There are 5 astrapia species, the Huon astrapia is not shown and the other species are shown briefly (either filmed or photos) without any commentary.
-Riflebirds are shown briefly, without commentary, but it is never mentioned that 2 of the 3 riflebirds are endemic to Australia. This film focuses on New Guinea as the remote region where the birds of paradise occur, but 2 members of this family are found only in the Moluccas, and 2 only in Australia.
-There is a false claim at 16:53 by the narrator that this documentary shows the first ever recorded footage of a displaying male Emperor BOP (very briefly shown). This species is shown calling and displaying in ""Life on Earth,"" narrated by David Attenborough, produced many years ago.

I'll stop there.

Granted, the time and effort carried out by Laman and Scholes in the field is a major lifetime achievement and I would not want to minimize their endeavors. Further, this is some of the clearest, HD footage on these birds that exists to date; truly remarkable and stunning videography/photography--Hat's off to these two. But I do feel that National Geographic got their hands on this production and as a result 1) the focus of the birds was lost and 2) inaccurate claims were made, to put it respectfully.",1354320000,74,2630,4.696312364425163

I saw the trailer for this on youtube and got very excited as they showed the rare birds of paradise in lovely footage and they mentioned that this is the first time they had documented all 39 species.  So I anxiously wait for it to arrive and put it in my dvd player right away.  They showed the camera crew and all their gear and that was neat at first to see them climb up mountains with that. But then it went on and on about a village tribe, camping, failed videos and such.  I certainly did not see 39 species of birds. A handful if that were shown.  Silly me for expecting this to have been educational and in the style of Attenborough where a species is presented, talked about (the education part) and then move on to the next species.  Give the name, the location, what males and females look like, behavior and if possible show the nests. So the point was that they DID finally film 39 birds, so where were the other 35?  This was not an educational documentary but an annoying reality show. Now I am also a photographer and though seeing the cameras and set up was kind of neat it is not what I spent my money on.  This was supposed to be about all the birds of paradise and this was not the case at all. If they succeeded in this endeavor then why didn't they show it? Was very disappointed and will soon take it to a used DVD shop and see if I can get something worth while like a cartoon instead.  If this is what National Geographic is putting out now a days then the quality of programing has really dropped.  Don't bother with this. Get something like Earth Flight or Life of Birds instead.",1428537600,5,1705,4.25077399380805

8531412,5,B008WAM2PG,"I enjoyed this DVD very much. Yes, it does have a lot of footage about the team but this is a National Geographic video. National Geographic is known for its inclusion of ALL life, not just the wild. I thought I was well balanced. Yes, Ed & Tim could have included more species. Perhaps a sequel is in the making if they have the footage. The bonus features were very nice. I'm glad I bought it. I have ""Birds of the Gods"", and this Nat Geo DVD complements the other nicely. Sometimes, birding and filming are extremely difficult to do. For example, pelagic birding. For me that's been the toughest so far. Sea sickness and instability can make the day almost impossible. The perils of the jungle can be deadly in their own right, therefore, viewing such experiences, as in the case of this Nat Geo expedition, can be most helpful in trip planning. I'll never get to Papua New Guinea except by this means (DVD), so I'm content with what I can find to watch and I thank the fearless men & women who do the research and work. I hope more is to come.",1423353600,,1047,4.346938775510204
