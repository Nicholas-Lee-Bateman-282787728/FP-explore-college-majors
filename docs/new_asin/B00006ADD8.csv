1735617,5,B00006ADD8,This is one of Paul Naschy's better movies thats out there today. Very good film with decent story and Paul Naschy as a werewolf..you cant beat that. If you like cheese in horror this is truly the one to be added to your collection. A true werewolf classic..recommended!!,1164758400,3,271,4.666666666666667
1735618,3,B00006ADD8,"""CURSE OF THE DEVIL"" is a lusty old time spanish werewolf classic! Any real true horror movie fan can appreciate these kind of timeless but out-dated cheesey gems. Perfect for a cold rainy day!",1129161600,2,193,4.705882352941177
1735619,5,B00006ADD8,"You can say what you will about these types of films, but you must admit that Naschy's passion for them, and his werewolf character Waldemar Daminsky, are astounding. He truly loves this genre and it shows. He brings the tragic and romantic elements of horror to his werewolf films and he gives passionate performances that make these movies great fun. I've enjoyed many of Mr Naschy's films and Curse of the Devil is no exception. Love it!",1093392000,2,440,4.7272727272727275
1735620,5,B00006ADD8,"I've always enjoyed Pual Naschy's work. He's especially good as a werewolf and has been playing that character since 1968 in close to a dozen films. I was eager to see this movie and then I read the reviews on here. One person said this movie had ""mindless nudity, sex, cheesy werewolf make up etc."" and then I was REALLY eager to see it! I got my grubby little hands on it and popped it in the DVD player and settled back and hit play and WOW! This is a fun movie and a great DVD! The picture quality is superb and there are tons of great extras. The promised ""mindless nudity, sex, cheesy werewolf make up etc."" are indeed all there too! Naschy gives another wonderful performance and the picture quality of this DVD is far superior to all the poor prints we've been forced to endure in the past. Naschy has established himself as a master of macabre cinema and the high quality presentation of this DVD is a great tribute to the man and a true treat for his fans.",1092787200,25,966,4.284153005464481
1735621,4,B00006ADD8,"Once you get past the obvious setbacks of the film:  an unconvincing lead, very bad make-up, horribly choreographed violence, and a pretty [weak]ending--there is some enjoyment to be had from Curse of the Devil.  To begin with, the story is actually pretty involving and the plot has some tricky forks in it at times.  The idea is very good:  an arrogant hero pays for that arrogance through a satanic curse, which seemingly is unbeatable.  Unfortunately, you have to make the mother of all suspensions of belief to deal with the actual werewolf.  Naschy just wasn't suited (bad pun!) for the job.  When you do have close-ups of the creature, there just isn't any menace conveyed-merely a frozen make-up expression.  When he attacks, it is almost comedic as, for most of the film, he quickly runs on screen and then off before the viewer has a chance to even register what has happened.  The opening sequence, if you're able to not laugh at what must be one of the lamest swordfight scenes ever filmed, is kinda cool with the way the pink tint conveys an otherworldly and othertimely atmosphere.  The gypsies in the beginning are very convincing in their vengeful rage.  All in all, it's not a bad movie.  There just aren't that many werewolf movies out there, so Curse of the Devil will come as a happy expansion on what you are already familiar with concerning werewolves of the screen.",1055289600,11,1388,4.7375
1735622,4,B00006ADD8,"Heres one i took a chance on, having never viewed it. Nice atmosphere helps a pretty good Werewolf story. In fact this is a story of a werewolfs origin due to a curse put on an ancestor of the man. Sexy women abound as witches, and the Werewolfs love interests.",1037491200,4,261,4.24
1735623,4,B00006ADD8,"First of all I would like to [say] that this film is dubbed and that's why it seemed like the characters lips weren't moving at times. Obviously he hasn't been exposed to the european stage because dubious dubbing is
ubiquitous throughout this genre here in North America. Good luck in tracking down the subtitled version. Anyway this film was great. Nice to see a brilliant sumptuous transfer in tact here. Actually the dubbing wasn't as bad in this one either. Make sure to watch Werewolf Shadow as a precursor to this.",1032912000,3,521,4.736263736263736
1735624,1,B00006ADD8,THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN  IT SEEN LIKE THE PICTURE WAS OUT OF TIMEING  PEOPLE WAS TALKING AN THEIR LIPS WAS NOT MOVING  I ONLY WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK,1031011200,,168,3.742857142857143
1735625,5,B00006ADD8,This is another in the set of Naschy werewolf films and it is great.  It is cult viewing at it's best and who better to play the werewolf than Naschy himself.  If you're a cult movie fan or love werewolf movies then this is a keeper.,969753600,6,233,4.043478260869565
7965981,4,B00006ADD8,"Entertaining older horror-adventure flick from Spain.  The late Paul Naschy in my view had been extensively featured in a number of lower budget Spanish movies from the late 60's all the way up to early 90's.  This one stands out as a more completed and somewhat interesting work.

Plot: Fairly standard as in many of his horror movies, a curse had been placed during the medveal times after a warlock knight is defeated by a noble Spanish knight working with the holy church to punish wicked doers including those who commit crimes in the practice of their black arts.  The curse contines down the Knight's descdent line where centuries later Paul Naschy's character is a wealthy Spanish business man whose town in the countryside is being assaulted by a wondering serial killer, only to find himself cursed by a group of sorceresses who wish to turn him into a monster worse than the killer, an out of control hungrey werewolf.

  There is some violence, some gore, and a couple of intense horror scenes but the blood is very phony, very low budget, where the movie to me should have been rated PG (the MPAA gave the film R I believe, which was a bit of an overeaction.).  The movie is mostly aimed at adults, but if the kids either cover their eyes during the gory scenes or simply laugh out loud at the awful effects, the movie could be seen by some kids and teens.

  The movie only slightly worked for me on the most slim of margins, so I will give this movie a very slight thumbs up.",1508112000,,1490,4.5018587360594795

7965983,5,B00006ADD8,"If you like Paul Naschy you will like this one. its a cool old movie with vampire chicks, werewolfs and blood. its some what slow but thats part of the appeal. a must see for Naschy fans.",1478908800,,187,4.081081081081081
7965984,4,B00006ADD8,"OK early 70's, Spanish-made, English-dubbed color Paul Naschy horror film.  A nobleman, suffering under the curse some devil-worshiping witches laid on his family tree, becomes a werewolf when the moon is full.  Naturally he messes up the neighborhood.  At 84 minutes, as far as I know, this version is the most complete available.  A fair amount of gore and nudity.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1476576000,,440,4.958904109589041
7965985,3,B00006ADD8,"I've read that the Waldemar Daninsky movies don't hold together, continuity-wise, but this one acts fairly well as a prequel to La Noche de Walpurgis/Werewolf Shadow.  It offers an origin story for the Daninsky curse in that previous movie (although it doesn't jive with the later Night of the Werewolf).  It begins with a Daninsky ancestor tracking down and killing a coven of Satan worshipers in the Dark Ages.  Just before the last archetypal witch is burned alive, she promises that someday a descendant of Daninsky will kill one of her kind and then his line will be cursed thereafter.  (A little convoluted... why not just curse Daninsky now?)  So hundreds of years go by, and 19th century Paul Naschy (did I mention he played the Dark Ages Daninsky, too?) shoots a wolf which turns out to be a man.  The local gypsies are outraged and send a pretty volunteer to sneak into the naive Daninsky's bedroom to mark him with the bite of a wolf's skull.  The movie then gets dull for a while, unfortunately.  An escaped  ax-wielding maniac (!) is roaming the hills, and draws the local constabulary off the scent while Daninsky racks up his own body count.  There is a huge amount of carnage in this movie, by the way.  Werewolf Daninsky bites necks and chests, even crushes a man's head with a rock!  There's some experimental editing and wild 70s camera work, but the wolf itself isn't scary.  Naschy just isn't as frenzied and frothy as I've seen him before, plus the wolf attack scenes would have benefited from growling sounds and music stings.  Too many fights involve a silent werewolf jumping at a victim, and Naschy's body language is rarely animal-like.  Too bad, because I liked his intensity in other films.",1416960000,,1719,4.7407407407407405
7965986,5,B00006ADD8,"I love Paul Naschy! He is so much like John Belushi that I love both of them just the same. they're both beautiful and talented in their own right, no matter what movie they make. I love how sensitive and emotional both of them are and I wish there were more actors as great as these two. Of course, the video is in good condition so I can see everything the way it should be. It is a great addition to my Paul Naschy collection.",1386115200,,429,4.0588235294117645
7965987,5,B00006ADD8,"Carlos Aured was a great director of Spanish horror.  This old fashioned wolfman film is sort of an upgrade to the old 1941 film with Lon Chaney; add satanism, gore, more violence, give it a 70s film style and feeling, reconfigure the plot to an extent, throw in some nudity for the sake of nudity and also toss in an axe murderer, and you got CURSE OF THE DEVIL that's one of Paul Naschy's best films.  The atmosphere and scenery is great, and there's ample gore and violence in this fast paced film. The women look good, and there's full nudity in the film.  The gore isn't over the top, but there's a sufficient amount of it spread throughout the movie, along with some good suspense and action. There's also a scene when a woman disrobes near Naschy and says she's not leaving a virgin, and then there's that axe murderer that's tossed in to spice things up.  That guy doesn't do much, but he's in the film for a short time nevertheless.  The old 1941 WOLFMAN is still a good film, but I admit that I liked this one better.

The DVD quality is very good.",1330646400,,1058,4.345177664974619
7965988,4,B00006ADD8,"the werewolf series of films that paul naschy did form 1968-2003
 is alot of fun and there are 12 of them.  this is one of the better ones and it's a mexican and spahish produced film with the lead female parts done by mexican actresses.  And that's a good thing.  The acting is fine but the transfer is choppy on this bci version.  It's like there are frames missing from the print. I also have the werewolf shadow dvd from this company and it's not choppy or at least not so noticable.  I don't know what happened by it is a defect that bci should do something about.  I hope that someone gets out the rest of the series as well because this is vintage werewolf mania that is directly related in makeup style to the classic wolfman movies from universal. I think Naschy did a great job this time around with his tormented lead character that only a woman who loves him can save him from the curse.  The title refers to the curse that is put upon his family line and not that the werewolf is a devil.  If you love vintage horror that was done by people who tried to make a decent flick then this may be for you. And bci usually does a excellent job so don't be afraid to get any other of their titles.",1221350400,4,1202,4.1688311688311686
7965989,4,B00006ADD8,"I grew up watching ""Dark Shadows"" and one of my favorite characters was Quentin Collins.  He was a victim of a werewolf curse that was placed on him when he accidentally murdered his insane gypsy wife.  Waldemar Daninsky of ""Curse of the Devil"" reminds me very much of poor Quentin.  Daninsky accidentally shoots a gypsy (having mistook him for a wolf) and the werewolf curse is placed on him by devil worshipping gypsies.  During the full moon, he roams the countryside killing anyone who crosses his path; the superstitious villagers believe a werewolf is prowling the Carpathian woods, but the police believe it's an ax murderer who recently escaped from a mental institute.  As a result of having two murderers, the body count is deliciously high, higher than a ""Friday the 13th"" movie.  ""Curse of the Devil"" is very action packed.

  From the interesting liner notes that came with the DVD, I learned that ""Curse of the Devil"" is the sixth werewolf movie in eleven that stars Spanish horror icon, Paul Naschy.  Most, if not all, were written by Naschy under his pseudonym, Jacinto Molina.  It is no wonder he has love scenes with all of the beautiful lead actresses.  His screenplays are well written; their plots are always complex, almost too complex.

  I was overjoyed to discover that ""Curse of the Devil"" is gothic horror.  It is set in the late 1800's.  In fact, the prologue is set in the Medieval Dark Ages.  The best scenes are in the prologue.  Daninsky's ancestor destroys a coven of witches; there is a gruesome decapitation, multiple hangings of beautiful women from a bridge, and the burning of the priestess.  The ending is wonderfully downbeat as were many horror movies of the seventies.

  Also, from the liner notes, I learned that Paul Naschy did not wear a mask during his scenes as a werewolf.  He spent many grueling hours sitting patently while the makeup artist applied the hair, fangs, etc.  Never did he look as though he was wearing a mask.

  ""Curse of the Devil"" is highly recommended for those who are fans of Paul Naschy.  I have only seen one werewolf movie from Hammer, ""Curse of the Werewolf.""  I thought ""Curse of the Devil"" would satisfy my craving.  Instead, I need to watch more werewolf movies starring Paul Naschy.  Fortunately, BCI Eclipse came out with ""Werewolf Shadow,"" which I will be watching soon.",1218067200,5,2351,4.785536159600998
7965990,2,B00006ADD8,"This movie didn't make a whole lot of sense at first and I was confused by this movie under 30 minutes. A witch gets burned in the beginning of the movie which eventually somehow makes a curse to turn Paul Naschy back into a Werewolf hundreds of years later. This was odd. Basically an evil devil lady a skull of a demon with blood on it is made to bite Naschy & gets the Werewolf curse again. And she is killed by an axe murderer. The werewolf outfit this time was sort of goofy(you can see under the mask a little) & the face was weird looking. The transformation scenes were well done but overall it was just not that good - mostly in the 1st 30 minutes. Pretty graphically gory throughout the movie with rips and slashes of human flesh all over the place(bites in the neck, punctures in the chest) and as usual Naschy gets plenty of naked Naschy girls (full frontal - exposed breasts and well to be blunt hairy bush - hey this is Spanish horror) to be have sex with him. The love interest was lackluster. The Werewolf scenes were cool which saves the film and makes up for the first half hour.
Night of the Werewolf is much better. So Id see that one first.
Various websites are reporting that Curse of the Devil and The Werewolf shadow have defective discs..this is true on both titles. The people move oddly on them, its hard to explain but there is a choppiness to them when the people move..
Id get the Anchor Bay versions to be safe if you really want them. The transfers aren't all that different from BCI what Ive read.
++UPDATE++ Since I first made the review the Curse of the Devil DVD discs seem to have been fixed and there are various ways to get these movies via double disc sets or Naschy box sets. I think Werewolf Shadow is still problematic with BCI, but Curse of the Devil seems fine.",1214352000,4,1806,4.314705882352941
