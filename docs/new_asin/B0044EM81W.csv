I've always been deathly afraid to be the center of attention which presents challenges when being expected to perform for others. Adrienne takes 'learning how to get over your stage fright' to an entirely new level. Whether you are performing on stage, giving a presentation at work, giving a speech to a group of students or teaching a class, if you suffer from anxiousness while being the center of attention for any duration of time, it's applicable. I have found myself viewing each lesson a few times because I capture something new each time. Very thought provoking and powerful lessons from someone who has experienced first-hand what she's presenting. Very nice work Adrienne!",1285459200,,841,5.101449275362318

As a singer, I've always been able to get up on stage and sing, but I've never had to add vibrato. I was always shaking so badly that the vibrato happened by itself. I was also never able to be present in the moment. My nerves were so bad that I would mentally escape to a happier place in my mind while on stage. As a result, I could never recall being on stage. After completing this seminar, I have become the performer I always thought I could be. I'm present when performing, I connect deeply with my audience and, most importantly, I am able to be creatively expressive on stage and interpret the song I'm singing from a place of presence. Adrienne Osborn is a powerful, practical and insightful guide through this program. It's the most valuable investment I've ever made in my career. Buy this DVD right now!",1285372800,,914,4.479041916167665
