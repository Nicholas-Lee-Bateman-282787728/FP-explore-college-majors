773797,4,6304078080,"Quite possibly I am somewhat more qualified than the average North American viewer to review this film as I am an expatriate South African living in Canada.  This film is set in the depths of the apartheid era in South Africa and based on a best selling book by Alan Paton.  Although the casual viewer might think the film / book sets out to expose the travesties of Apartheid, it really is about the love of a father and how the color of your skin cannot change this aspect of human life.
A truly gripping story with excellent acting - you would need a heart of stone to make it through this film without shedding a tear.",1094860800,3,622,4.3076923076923075
773798,5,6304078080,"I am 22.  I love action movies, I love well executed sci-fi thrillers . . . so why on earth would I rate this as my favorite film of all time? . . .
  . . .Because one gets to a point in one's life when movies or any art for that matter, isn't about how much one is shocked, or how ""entertained"" one becomes . . . watching movies becomes like a mature appreciation of alcohol: one drinks and appreciates until satisfaction; not to become inebriated.

  This film is the single most satisfying piece of visual art (besides the Brothers Karamazov, if that is visual art) I have ever experienced in my life.  In metaphor to the prodigal son, the film deals with not only racial reconciliation, but much more importantly the deepest behavioral issues and ethos of agape: intense love for a family member.
  This is the single most redemptive film I have ever seen.  The performances are riveting and non-cliched, and the cinematography is fascinatingly spectacular.  Richard Harris delivers a breathtakingly believable portrayal of a rich white racist (of sorts) whose acting is really put to the test in incredible subtle and emotionally charged interplays between the novels colorful characters.
  James Earl Jones' presence is nothing short of phenomenal.  His performance is so captivating that tt seems that he might actually have been through a similar occurance in his own life.
  Of all the incredible movies that have been made, this is my favorite film.  Please, do rent it.  There are also some helpful reviews on the movies pace below my review as well.",1086566400,10,1561,4.782771535580524
773799,5,6304078080,"I am in the process of reading the book on which this movie is based.  Usually, reading the book leads you to say, ""The book is so much better.""  Not so with this movie.  Yes, the book is fantastic.  But reading it has increased my appreciation for the movie even more.  Particularly the acting by Jones and Harrison.  It is impressive how much emotion and meaning they convey without the aid of a narrator or augmented dialogue.",1067904000,6,429,4.5064935064935066
773800,5,6304078080,"I remember seeing the trailers for ""Cry, The Beloved Country,"" in the theater before it came out, later I realized I missed my chance to see it on the big screen when I saw it in the video store.  I can only imagine the impact this movie would have on me if I had seen it on the big screen.
In the opening scenes the audience is treated to absolutely breath-taking images of the hills of South Africa, it is there that you are introduced to the story's protangonist Rev. Kumalo, the pastor of a small country church in South Africa.  The role of Kumalo is played brilliantly by James Earl Jones.
In the opening scenes Rev. Kumalo travels to Johannesburg to come to the aid of his sister and to search for his son.  While in Johannesburg, the lives of Rev. Kumalo and James Jarvis, a weathly farmer and neighbor of Kumalo played by Richard Harris, are brought together by an event (I will leave it at that) that will profoundly affect the lives of both men.  Pay particular attention to the scene where Jones and Harris first meet, it is a wonderful example what is possible when two accomplished actors are put together and given the chance to ply their trades.
""Cry, The Beloved Country,"" does require some patience from the viewer, director Darrell Roodt builds the story slowly and deliberately, and even this level of dillegence doesn't completely pay off, but when the movie comes to it's climax I can guarantee you will appreciate the time Roodt took to set up the story in the beginning of the movie.
This is really the story of an honest man in dishonest wolrd and the effect individuals can make in the lives of others.  This movie should have recieved much more attention when it was in the theaters and Jones should have recieved an Oscar nomination for his preformance.
The final scene of the movie ends much as it starts, in the hills of South Africa.  Director Darrel Roodt uses this local as bookends for this wonderous story.  This movie is not available on DVD, but look for it on video tape it is well worth the effort.",1022544000,26,2037,4.504065040650406
773801,5,6304078080,This movie was based on how a preacher suffered with many family problems and how he kept his faith and held on to his faith and he was rewarded in the end.  It was one of the best drama's I have ever seen.,1003795200,4,206,3.7906976744186047
773802,4,6304078080,"I enjoyed the movie a lot. It even made me cry (and I rarely cry). But, I was dissapointed in the way it was written for the screen. The movie left out much of Book 3 as well as what I thought was one of the most important concepts from the book: repentance. Absalom's repentance was never portrayed. The fact that he prayed to God for forgiveness is vital. Had I not already read the book, I would have not had the same emotional reactions. It is absolutely terrific, but it does not quite do justice to Patton's Pre-Aparthied novel.",1003622400,8,534,4.35
773803,5,6304078080,"This adaptation of Alan Paton's best selling novel is superior to the 1951 version starring Sidney Poitier, though that earlier adaptation is also excellent. Here, Richard Harris gives a sharply drawn performance as a hard nosed, well to do landowner in South Africa with a somewhat negative attitude toward the native population. James Earl Jones gives a beautifully nuanced, sensitive performance as a simple, country preacher who is described by a colleague as simply the ""best man he ever met"".

The story takes place in 1946. The preacher temporaily leaves his flock and family to go to Johannesburg  to search for his brother, his sister, and his son, Absalom. For those who are well versed in the Bible, the name ""Absalom"" is not without significance.

He finds all three, but too late. His brother has turned away from the church and become involved in racial politics. His sister has turned to prostitution, and his son has become involved with less than salubrious companions.

The landowner lives in the same countryside as the preacher, and he, too, has a son. As did the preacher's son, his had also migrated to Johannesburg, and was a well known city engineer, as well as an altruist dedicated to helping the native population. Unfortunately, the son ends up murdered in his own home by a gang of natives, one of whom is Absalom.

While the landowner and the preacher may have been from the same area and their paths may have crossed, they had never before spoken to one another, until their paths tragically intersected through their sons: one murdered, the other, the murderer. Their respective journeys to reach their sons serves to starkly draw the contrast between White and Black South Africa. In fact, this is essentially the story of two South Africas, one White, the other, Black.

It is also the story of two fathers, each finding that his son is lost to him forever. What follows is the struggle of each father to understand what happened, and the reasons why it may have happened in the bigger context. Ultimately, they are just fathers, united in sorrow, as they never could have been in life, at least not in South Africa; neither of whom comprehends the new order of things to come. Yet, as each discovers who his son had been, a new understanding dawns upon them and a barrier is surmounted.

There is an inadvertent meeting between the two fathers while in Johannesburg, that is one of the most moving scenes of any film, carried by the affecting performances of Harris and Jones. It is a moment that is certainly not lost on the viewer. There is also one other scene where the fathers meet again, back in the countryside where they are from. Again, Harris and Jones create a mood that bespeaks volumes, such is their talent.

This is an incredible and memorable film that should not be missed. Harris and Jones are supported by Charles Dutton, who gives a dynamic performance as the preacher's errant brother, and by a largely unknown cast who are uniformly excellent. This is a quality film from beginning to end.",981244800,78,3046,4.788571428571428
773804,5,6304078080,"This adaptation of Alan Paton's instant classic Cry the Beloved Country is one of the few movies which does the book justice.  And while I still prefer the book for its beautiful, poetic depth of character, thought etc, I must say that Richard Harris and James Earl Jones give outstanding performances.  This might be enough to commend the movie to some.
The movie gives a powerful picture of some of the issues which existed in South Africa before Apartheid became official policy, but which certainly prefigured much of that horrid system of government.  The story of two men caught in tragic circumstances,(James Earl Jones, a black preacher in rural South Africa, whose people/families are being lost to the ""mines"" and industry of the cities, loses his son, who kills the son of a white landowner/neighbor(Harris) while living in Johannesburg). A study in how each man, seeks to deal with the realities of life in these tragic circumstances, without succumbing to the further tragedy of marxism which would later infect South Africa.
A wonderful picture of ""life"" in the midst of tragedy",979689600,6,1092,5.0220994475138125

774381,5,6304078080,"Amazing that this film came out nearly twenty years ago (1995) and it took me this long to finally watch it! Cry, the Beloved Country came out one year following the South African Apartheid reforms in 1994. This was when the separatist approach to syphoning off and separating non-Europeans from Europeans in that part of the world was finally overruled. Apartheid was literally a systematic and structured social institution in South African society bent on upholding the idea that Blacks, Whites and other ethnicities were not only unequal but were not to intermingle with each other socially (or any other way). The culture of Johannesburg, the townships and other areas was one of intensity, violence and oppression. In the wake of the reforms, Truth & Reconciliation Commissions took place. This was the opportunity for victims of this enforced racism to give testimony as to the violence they had experienced. Blacks speaking of unbelievable human rights violations and other atrocities, White preachers speaking of torture and acts of aggression and violence against their person.

Cry, the Beloved Country is set in 1946 and the rolling hills of the nation are a beautiful backdrop for less than beautiful acts of hatred between people, as well as the stoicism and bravery that peace loving men continue to uphold in the face of darkness and discouragement. Two fathers (James Earl Jones and Richard Harris) are brought together due to tragic circumstances. One is a preacher of peace and the other is a wealthy landowner. They are also from different backgrounds at a time where it is unheard of for Blacks and Whites to barely speak to each other. In spite of the turbulence, they make space for a peaceful bond to build - almost like an oasis for reconciliation.

The acting is superb, the beautiful landscape is so rich with color and dimension and it transfers so well to the television screen. This is definitely not a film that requires going to the movie theater for full effect. I wish more films existed like this. The times are so difficult and director Darrell James Roodt beautifully recreates the novel written by Alan Paton with his actors. Don't miss this gem.",1381449600,,2184,4.96448087431694

774447,5,6304078080,"'Cry the Beloved Country' :

This movie moved me to tears. Set just after the war when whites and blacks lived in reasonable harmony. During that time I seldom questioned he fact that black people were living humbly and in poverty while we whites enjoyed a high standard of living, using them as cheap labour. It was the correct order of things that coloured people knew their place. They were to be treated with Christian kindness and provided with a basic education and health care. Of course in separate institutions from ours.

The film precedes the change when the Afrikaner Nationalist government gained power. They were filled with hate. They were the descendants of the Boers and kept reminding people how they had suffered under the Black tribes (eight 'Kaffir' Wars) and by the 'English' (Boer War). They succeeded in removing the scales from my  eyes. I became aware of the plight of black people and horrified by the brutality towards them.

I left my beloved country in despair, never to live there again. I could not have  envisaged a great man would come along and despite 18 years of imprisonment, be determined to bring back democracy without bloodshed.

What did Book 3 ever do to you? Why is Arthur Jarvis' son missing from the end? What about the milk that saves the child's life? What about the dam that will make the grass green again? Are we supposed to believe that one rain storm healed the valley? No tribal chief, no agricultural expert, no fight between the brothers, etc. After the beginning of the film did such a good job with cinematography and portraying Jo'burg realistically, we were let down that the resolution was so abbreviated. One highlight was Msimangu's character, who really brought out his frustration. Obviously James Earl Jones and Richard Harris nail the roles of the fathers. Overall, even though they missed lots of stuff, everything that was in there was done pretty well. Worthwhile for classroom use, but read the novel for a better perspective and human experience.

The way they speak is straight out of the book, so to help you I'll just say, Umfundisi is a priest. Umzana is a word of respect like Sir.  Go well, and stay well are their way of saying have a good day, or see you later.

774682,3,6304078080,"So many reviewers have praised this film as one of the best movies, if not the best movie, ever made, that one almost feels guilty expressing reservations about it.  And then there's the subject matter, which dares you not to treat it with reverence.  And, on top of all that, Nelson Mandela liked it!

But the fact is, for all its obviously high aspirations, when considered as a film rather than a moral or spiritual event, ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" is a very mixed bag.  John Barry's score is lovely and the photography of the South African countryside is gorgeous.  The period (1946) is nicely done.  But the script is a muddle ... James Earl Jones's character (a rural Anglican priest) heads into the big city on not one but four quests: to find his son (who turns out to have comitted a murder in a botched robbery attempt), to reconnect with his brother (who has abandoned Christianity for political action), to find his sister (she's become a prostitute), and to find another woman whose connection with him was never made entirely clear, at least to me (she's never found, her only plot function seems to be to allow her former white mistress to express utter disinterest in her whereabouts).  Richard Harris's character, a crusty white farmer whose liberal son is murdered (by Jones's son, it turns out), has a sudden and not particularly convincing transformation from racial bigot to sensitive liberal -- the turning point apparently being getting a good long look at Jones's suffering face with tears running down those massive cheeks.  Conincidences abound and the son's guilt -- he readily admits to the murder, but keeps insisting he didn't mean to do it, he was simply afraid (while attempting a robbery, it should be remembered)-- seems somehow minimized both by the son and the script, as if being a victim of the appalling racial system of that time and not going into the robbery intending to commit murder are sufficient to be morally exonerating.

And apart from the script, Jones's performance was for me -- contrary to many of the other reviews -- one of the biggest problems with the film.  It's as if he's performing under water or slogging his way through thigh-deep mud.  Every line, every pause (and there are a lot of pauses), every gesture seems to be in slow motion.  Apparently Jones and his director were aiming for some sort of transcendent dignity or spirituality, but the performance, like Jones's out-of-the-cavern voice, is ponderous and ultimately sucks much, if not all, of the life out of the film.

""Cry, the Beloved Country"" obviously intends to make a ""big"" statement about apartheid and reconciliation, but apart from the occasional callous remark from a white character, the systemic degredation of blacks under that system is curiously muffled.  Most of the cruelties we see inflicted are black-on-black.  And, as already noted, the big moment of reconciliation between Harris's white farmer and Jones's black priest felt too quick, too easy, and finally unconvincing.

Contrary to the more negative reviews, this film is not a complete waste of time, but it feels twice its length and left this viewer curiouisly unmoved, despite its admirable intentions.",1349308800,,3206,4.942271880819367

That is how we begin our film.  The priest played by James Earl Jones is told that he should come visit Johannesburg.

774684,5,6304078080,"Richard Harris and James Earl Jones are superb in portraying opposite sides of the racial conflict which so besets us these days.  They both must endure painful circumstances to arrive at a heart changing accommodation with one another, but they do it through God's grace and a willingness to change.  Beyond the racial issues the film also addresses the anguish any parent feels when a loved child goes astray.  How do you deal with that?  You don't deny it.  You face it and again rely on God's grace to get you through the trials and inevitable self-recriminations.

However, the movie (based on Alan Paton's book) is about far more than just racial and family problems.  At its core it is about man's basic problem of sin and his consequent estrangement from God.  Yet the movie does not get ""preachy"" in the way it approaches that problem.  While it does not give a direct gospel message, it clearly points to the Christian God as the solution.  From that perspective it can provide a wonderful launching pad for after-viewing discussions of the details of the ultimate solution.

Set in 1946 South Africa, the movie achieves balance by showing good and bad on both sides of the racial divide.  Harris is a prosperous farmer while Jones is a rural Anglican priest struggling with serious family problems, the problems of his poor congregation, and the consequences of the racial difficulties that eventually come to a head in the quagmire of metropolitan Johannesburg.  The ""beloved country"" is vividly shown in the spectacular beauty of the South African countryside.  The tears come from the human suffering brought about by our own sins--not just black vs. white, but by all of humankind.  It is almost as if we are seeing the Garden of Eden experiencing the results of the Fall in a more modern setting.

Harris is complacent in his prosperity until he is struck with a gut-wrenching family tragedy that rises directly from the larger problems of the whole society.  Jones is independently struggling with the personal and family consequences of the same tragedy.  Neither man knows the other for the first half of the drama.  The film is masterful in the way it builds to a convergence of the problems and the first meeting of the two men.

At that meeting there is some distance between the two men and Harris has his back to Jones when he suddenly realizes the awful truth of their circumstances.  The camera lingers for several moments as Harris faces his time of decision.  Will he continue as before or will he take the first step towards a personal solution?--a personal solution that must be replicated a million times and more on both sides before the larger problems are solved.

The last half of the film continues in a very positive way as many problems are resolved.  However, the larger issue of man's estrangement from God still remains along with its inevitable and heartbreaking consequences.  We see Jones kneeling in prayer on a beautiful South African mountainside, his heart heavy with sorrow over his son, but relying on God's ultimate solution and comfort for all who trust in Him.

This is a magnificent movie and I would recommend it to everyone who sincerely wants to get to the heart of our human problem in whatever form it manifests itself.

P.S. two terms are used quite frequently in the movie but never explained.  However, the book gives these definitions: 1) ""Umfundisi"" means ""parson,"" but it is also a title and used with respect; 2) ""Umnumzana"" simply means ""sir.""",1337299200,,3510,4.834170854271357

The son of prejudiced white parents, the murdered white man had grown to become an outstanding, well recognized spokesman against apartheid and for equality among the races in South Africa.  When the murdered man's father, ignorant of his son's work, reads it, he embraces the concepts.
  Ultimately the black priest and the white landowner meet one another, although both had been much aware of the other's existence.

774917,5,6304078080,"Darrell Roodt chose carefully when it was time to direct the first film of South Africa after the abolition of Apartheid.  Alan Paton's novel was first filmed in 1951, and ""Cry the Beloved Country"" is a tale that seems as much a part of the South African collective zeitgeist as Twain or Hemingway or Steinbeck is part of America's.

This film version is centered around perhaps James Earl Jones' most powerful screen performance.  He stars as the Reverend Stephen Kumalo, a clergyman from a small town in South Africa.  He is a strong man of faith and leads a congregation in matters both religious and practical.  His son ran away to Johannesburg to work in the mines, and his sister went away also to join her husband.  His brother, John, is also in the city, an outspoken black activist who has abandoned the ways of religion because religion is not creating justice for blacks. The film opens with Reverend Kumalo receiving word that things are not all well in Johannesburg.

Richard Harris has the role of James Jarvis, a wealthy white landowner from the same small town.  His son has also gone to Johannesburg, where he works as an activist trying to improve the repressed condition of the South African Blacks who are only starting to come under the evil thumb of Apartheid.

The whites and blacks are so separate that although they are two of the most prominent figures in a small town, Mr. Jarvis and the Reverend Kumalo have not even met as the movie opens.  Tragedy strikes, more than once, and without spoiling the plot I'll just reveal that it involves the two sons of these two characters.

Roodt goes out of his way to display the noble suffering of Reverend Kumalo.  He never speaks a discouraging word, even when confronting terrible injustice.  The story hinges on Kumalo's innate goodness, and Mr. Jones brings this to life in a way that carries the story along.

It is worth mentioning a single scene - the one in which Kumalo and Jarvis first meet.  The previously mentioned tragedy has already occurred and both men are in a kind of mourning.  Kumalo knows Jarvis while Jarvis vaguely recognizes Kumalo.  The Reverend confides in the powerful white man that ""My greatest sorrow is also your greatest sorrow"".  The performances by these two great actors in this powerful scene would be reason alone to watch this film, but I would still recommend the movie with that centerpiece scene removed.

It is clich&eacute;d to say that the world would be a better place if we were collectively more understanding and tolerant of those who were different from us, but ""Cry the Beloved Country"" brings this sentiment forward in a way that is realistic and powerful.",1139356800,29,2677,4.755411255411255

I could use words like captivating, rapturous or brilliant to describe the screenplay, the acting, the mood of this film; but I'm not going to. To do so would be wrong, for this film does something that most films can not - it speaks for itself.

In it, we have two fathers. One, a minister (Earl Jones) during apartheid in South Africa. Another (Harris) is a rich man who never understood his son. When the pastor's son fearfully and regretfully kills the rich man's son, we witness the human condition at its frailest core. The pastor's shame all but consumes him while the rich man is more pained by the fact that he never was able to know his son who so painstakingly worked to restore racial harmony long before it was popular. Instead of adding to the pastor's guilt, grief and pain at what his son has done, he restores him by graciously forgiving the man and his child. It is as if each man knows his place and is unwilling to move above it. Jones' character cannot forgive himself for what his son has done and Harris' character cannot forgive himself for refusing to reach a bit further into his boy's life. They find healing in one another, and this adds to the tone of the film.

This film is altogether amazing, both story-wise and visually. Both men tread upon great pains in this film, pains that cut them to the heart, but both persevere.

An Aside on Postmodern Glasses
Do you have the eyes and ears to absorb and grow from this movie?  Roger Ebert's web site expresses a common view: ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" reflects a sentimentality that motivates many people, but it fails as a portrait of what it used to be like in South Africa, what happened and what it's like now.""  No details are given.

No, what is more likely is that nowadays this type of movie offends our sensibilities. We would rather be RIGHT and move in a direction that divides from other human beings, the deplorables who don't deserve to be heard.  We cover our ears -- fearing what exactly?.

The present Postmodern focus is only on power and an arrogant belief that we can correct the past...that we as human beings don't need to revisit the past over and over again to correct ourselves. Rather we should only ""use"" the past to forge our weapons of power.

It's hard to believe, but Postmodernism used to be a claim that there is no truth, only multiple views each with it's merit. In spite of that Postmodernism has devolved into a belief that the Present Judgments of ""activists"" for Right are alone true and correct.

As is common with human arrogance -- Postmodernists have become the thing they hate. More of us need to say: Return to history; Study it's rich details again and again; Do not be quick to reach conclusions -- let alone judgments, and certainly, Don't force history to conform to your utopian vision of control and power-over others.  Seek first power over yourself and your heart's all-too-human motivations and hidden passageways.

This particular narrative -- Cry, The Beloved Country is inseparable from history. It is a movie to return to as time changes our views and ideas. I watch this film in 2017 while white farmers in South Africa are murdered in their fields. In 2017 you can easily and immediately hear voices of anger and self-righteousness on YouTube.

Have we advanced in the ways that matter? In an age that mocks love and spiritual values as sentimental Kumbaya, we seem to believe anger and authoritarian political correctness is the only way to change things.

Yet something different is emerging in spite of our ideology of perfection as white farmers are being asked to come back and manage farms that have failed to produce adequately.  And the cry for a deeper spiritual journey is still heard in the land -- if only by the few.

You can only enter a movie on its own terms; submit to its language and meaning in order to benefit from it. Don't enter with pre-processed views of superiority.

The formal style of language and address in Cry,The Beloved Country, the slow simple yet intense movement of characters is that of a parable. A parable slows and simplifies in order to say, ""Your life matters; what you do and say matters. How you do what you do matters.

Watch the subtle moves and pulls of your soul -- the way you proceed also matters."" It points beyond the deconstructions and abstract narratives, the rationalizing, the complicated analyses and justifications, and final absolute conclusions of judgment and self-righteousness. It points to the deeper values of our hidden hearts.

The parable style is like the rules of certain forms of poetry or art -- say a sonnet -- these beautiful meaningful creations are achievable only if you stay within the parameters of the sonnet. The artist submits to its rules and so is trained to higher things.

So with the polite civility of a South African Christian parable. Where might it lead if we take this path? I think this is the path not taken, that we can now revisit. Is it too late to even consider this path?  I think not, each in his or her own way.

It is a reversal of the heros journey -- a classic mythic trope of youth looking for the wise father or wise mother.  In such desperate times it is the fathers who must journey in search of the sons.

Since a major institution in this movie and in South African society -- white or black -- is the Christian church, that fathers are needed to go in search of dead or soon-to-die sons is a profound statement to reflect on.  Its as if Jesus, his suffering and death, is found wanting or even rejected as NOT enough -- even by those who hold him most dear.  As society breaks down and legal institutions fail to address larger wrongs, the fathers on both sides are asked to take the dark journey of the soul.

The fathers represent not just the present, but also the past and the possibilities of the future.  The usual role of the hero demands more than just present victory.  The sons represent a bloody present  both die. The lives of both only find lasting meaning in the choices the fathers make. Only a generational love can break the cycles of hate and anger.

The black father chooses to take in as daughter the poor girl who his son has impregnated, and her baby as his grandson, a symbol of hope. The white father has no such future since his one son is dead, but gives enough to erect a new black church in memory of his son. The real choices however are internal ones.

This 1994 movie probably would not be made today, yet it articulated the tropes that define cultural warriors of today, more than 20 years later. The white landowners son expresses an utter contempt for whiteness and its history in South Africa.  His sense of guilt is absolute, yet strangely not a complete answer. The father is needed for that.

The father chooses to fully deeply listen to his son's contempt for him in his final letter, and to change in response, to turn from bitterness and angry righteousness, but not to self-hate. How is this love sentimental as some reviewers have said?  Only if you believe love is a problem, an obstacle and a burden, can this inner victory and complex stance be called sentimental.

The sons are finally not the heroes.  They are the touchstones around which the heroes the fathers  can reach with broken yet nevertheless open hearts for change and redemption.  Through many unknown difficulties with courage and self-sacrifice the fathers journey in order to find our better selves, returning to society with the boon of healing and renewal.

The movie does not say how wrongs are to be righted. Can wrongs even be righted? Can society be fixed?  Can a utopia be demanded? The movie rather is an appeal to individual choice -- to choices that one can be proud of or at least find lasting peace with.

The pastor's brother, it is true, is shown in a darker light.  He is in the field of potential violence; there is no avoiding the dark element of that.  So the movie is speaking truth in it's own language.  However, he is the hero's brother still.

Clearly the hero does not reject the brother; the brother has chosen to ignore and not reconcile with the family, the village, the church. The potential good of the secular values of the city are left unexplored. Perhaps it was not time for that.  But the road to reconciliation is not closed off in this movie, and the message is timeless.",1513468800,,7770,4.626365622723962

While it takes place in apartheid South Africa the story is timeless in how it deals with race, love, hate, grief, respect, and life.  Very close to the book and with two great actors, I can't recommend it highly enough.",1487635200,,305,4.333333333333333
