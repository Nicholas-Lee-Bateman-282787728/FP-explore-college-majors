2259498,5,B0008JHD2G,I love this 30 Minute Walk. I have been doing if for about 2 months now and I can really tell a difference. It goes at just the right speed to keep up with but is a good workout for people who can't get outside to go walking.,1185926400,7,225,3.7083333333333335
2259499,4,B0008JHD2G,"This is the 2nd Leslie Sansone walk video I purchased.  I like it very much.  The workout is good.  She increases the speed and intensity of the workout gradually so it is easy to keep up.  The 30 minutes goes quickly and it is easy to get this video in every day.  There are only two things I do not like.  First, she talks way too much (she even admits that during the workout).  Second, the music is hard to hear.  When you turn the volume up, all you can hear is the talking.  If you can get past that, you will like this workout.",1182902400,8,534,4.0095238095238095
2259500,4,B0008JHD2G,"If you are looking for a quick, low-impact workout, this one is great. It's not intense enough for someone in really good shape, but it's plenty for someone starting out or recovering from an injury. After learning I was pregnant, I wanted a low-impact workout that wasn't yoga or pilates. This one is fun and can be modified up or down for a more or less intense workout. Leslie Sansone is a chatterbox but she keeps you moving.",1182297600,5,429,4.512820512820513
2259501,5,B0008JHD2G,I sweat to this one! A good fast pace. I have several other of Leslie's DVD's and this one was a very good carido workout without weights.,1181174400,6,138,4.148148148148148
2259502,5,B0008JHD2G,I now have two Leslie Sansone videos and love them both.  I highly recommend this one and Walk Strong.  It's time to get into shape!!,1157241600,8,133,4.28
2259503,4,B0008JHD2G,"If you don't have lots of time but want to get in a good 30 minute 2 mile workout, this one is for you.  Leslie does her basic 4 steps with a nice little warm-up.  The pace quickly picks up and her movements are never boring.  I like the fact that she uses the arms with her walking steps so I feel like I get an upper body as well as a lower body workout.  There are no weights in this one as in some of the her other videos. I have about 6 of Leslie's DVD's and I like all of them.  I gave this one a 4 because she's a bit chatty and the music is sometimes difficult to hear.  All in all, you'll get a great workout in just 30 minutes.",1156118400,37,637,3.716417910447761
2259504,5,B0008JHD2G,"Love this workout, definetly a good one for being only 30 minutes.  I have used several of Leslie's walking tapes, mainly the 3 Mile for Abs, and have always had success with them, when I stuck to it!  Last year I lost 40 lbs using that particular program, now that I am married with a bigger house to clean and a longer drive to work, I don't have the time for the 45 minute workout so I bought this 30 minute DVD.  It gets your heart rate up and it's over before you know it.  I have always hated to exercise but now I don't mind at all.  If I can lose weight with her programs, ANYONE can!",1152403200,41,592,3.983050847457627
2259505,2,B0008JHD2G,They must have turned down the music and upped her mic. Because I have to turn this one all the way up to even hear the music slightly. I think she does talk entirely too much but I try to tune out the talking and do the walking  :),1151280000,11,232,3.7346938775510203
2259506,4,B0008JHD2G,"This is an older Leslie Sansone workout that has been re-packaged. It is a great 2-Mile, 30 minute workout (which is a great workout length for me) and is well put together. I like this group of walkers too.  This one is one of my new favorites!",1142380800,73,245,4.212765957446808
2259507,5,B0008JHD2G,"I actually bought this for a friend, because I already own it and have had great success.  I use it just about every day and between making better food choices and this super easy workout I have lost 50 pounds.  I am 61 years old and if it works for me it will work for you too!!",1485388800,4,279,3.8771929824561404

2259515,5,B0008JHD2G,"She sinful and down to earth. This is a great work out for beginners and those who have been exercising for a while. I fall into the beginner category. I'm 52 and have not done anything besides walk outside. This was a manga le workout, but tough enough that I was a wee bit sore the next day",1466726400,,292,4.051724137931035
2259516,5,B0008JHD2G,Bought a used version.  Arrived promptly and met the description posted.  Great workout to do every morning before showering and going to work.,1465689600,,143,5.173913043478261

2259518,4,B0008JHD2G,"I have several copies of this 30 minute walk from Leslie, because it is on multiple compilation DVD's of hers that I have.  I always skipped over it because it looked so cheesy.  The production values look like it was made in some local public TV studio, with this really weird, cheesy optical illusion type set design.  I have so many other ones that look better visually, that I skipped over this.  But one day I happened to finish one of Leslie's walks on a compilation DVD, and this one came up next.  So I decided to do it anyway.  WOW...I was more than pleasantly surprised.  This is a very, very good walk.  (I am an ""advanced beginner,"" meaning I an make it through 30 minutes without stopping but can't do really big movements or use weights all the way through yet.  And this would be good for either an advanced beginner or intermediate level walker).  First of all, Leslie is very focused in this video.  Unlike in some of her others, where she wanders around and talks to the cast, she stays up front, stays focused on counting down, gives great cues, and has an even number of each movement.  It is a very solid, easy to follow workout of simple calesthenic type moves, yet you will REALLY sweat with this one.  The 30 minutes flew by with this one too - I was never bored.  The one main flaw is that you can't hear the music at all, but this one is so easy to follow that you can just put on your own music and do it without needing to hear her cues.  I have around 50 exercise DVDs now, including many by Leslie, and this one is going to go into regular rotation.  I only wish I had tried it sooner!  I am taking away one star just because it looks so cheesy and you can't hear the music, but don't let that scare you off.  This is a GREAT workout - it's one of Leslie's best!!",1464393600,,1793,4.2082111436950145

2259520,5,B0008JHD2G,I really enjoy her DVD's. I always get a good workout. This one is good if you don't have much time it only takes 30 minutes and you still sweat and know that you are doing something good for yourself and your body.,1463702400,,215,4.023255813953488

I have been able to add other types of exercise into my routine, but I still include the walking workouts on days when it is more convenient to be at home.  The walks are fun, easy, and a great mood lifter!  I am never sorry after having walked with Leslie Sansone.",1461715200,3,424,4.197530864197531

2259528,5,B0008JHD2G,"I have had three - 3 - spinal surgeries and there are two comments I would make:
1. I don't think I would have come back so quickly from any one of the three surgeries if I hadn't been using Leslie Sansone's DVDs ti get in shape prior to the surgeries.
2. I plan to use Leslie's DVDs after this week to continue to stay in shape, build my stamina, and get rid of many unwanted pounds.
An aside: After the first surgery I ended up in the ICU because of complications.  I was very drugged up, but somehow pulled out my iPad, turned on the Leslie Sansone workout and began to workout.  The surgical resident doctor was making his rounds, saw me and went running - walking very fast - down the hall asking who was watching me and WHO gave me permission to be out of bed with ALL the tubes running from so many parts of my body.  I remember them wanting to put a buzzer on my bed after that - or so they told me.  I knew I had to back up and OWN my activity and be in control.  Have a good laugh.  They did watch me more closely after the next two surgeries!!!",1459209600,,1055,4.0

2259530,5,B0008JHD2G,An oldie but definitely a goody. A good pace with clear cues and easy to follow steps. The group is great with some of my favorite walkers and the set is attractive and well lit.  Leslie's instruction is very clear.  It's good to go over the basics whether a newbie or an experienced walker. I'll be using this many times I'm sure. I'd love to see some of this group back in some of the newer dvd's.,1458432000,2,399,4.1688311688311686

2259533,5,B0008JHD2G,"A Perfect Beginners Workout!  You use arms and thighs which powers up this routine. I do this every morning when possible and I'm working up to doing more miles.  I am 64 and have hip and lower back problems, so have to tone down the knee lifts and do plenty of stretching afterwards.  I am out of shape so this is a good beginner's workout for me.  I work up a sweat by the end of 2 miles, and plan to move on to her 5 mile mega walk soon.  I really enjoy Leslie Sansone.",1455494400,2,472,3.9263157894736844

2259566,4,B0008JHD2G,"I have 23 Leslie Sansone DVDs and a handful of the newer workouts online. These workouts are something anyone can do and have proven very beneficial to me with my particular health issues.

Three things are consistent with all her products - she talks louder than the music, she talks almost constantly, and there are usually, at least 2, miscues.
1. Her talk is all encouraging, informative, and helps you remember to keep proper alignment.
2. Some sound systems project a better balance than others but I just make sure I keep pace with one of the participants. Carol, if she's in it.
  A handful of DVDs provide a music only option and I understand you can also get music off of iTunes.
3. The miscues aren't a real problem unless you're a perfectionist. If so, do it a few times and you'll know when they're coming. Mostly, it's a countdown that doesn't result in a change when expected, or a direction to change with a delayed start.
None of these things really detract from the guidance she provides and the simple effectiveness of her methods. If you're going for weight loss, combined with a sensible diet, she can get you there. If you need to develop or maintain flexibility and joint mobility, these workouts will do it.

This particular one is a brisk paced, 2 mile (30 minute) workout that is very good for daily use.
I counted 3 miscues and yes, the audio is more audible from the speakers attached to my PC than from my TV speakers and is not as well balanced as some of the streaming videos published in that past 3 years on Amazon.  For these reasons only, I made it a 4 star review.",1437436800,3,1600,4.484536082474227

No equipment needed-it's a 2 mile/30min workout. If you have been out of the routine of working out this is a great video to get you started again. If you are looking for a low impact workout Leslie Sansone is great for that as well. I have had 2 back surgeries so I needed a low impact workout and her videos have been great for me. But don't get me wrong.. You will sweat and there is things she shows you during the video that are optional that can take it to a higher impact. As with all her videos it focuses on the same steps..

2259677,2,B0008JHD2G,"...as someone who has invested $$$ in Leslie Sansone's dvds, this one made me wonder whether the camera crew had been in a bar.
Lousy, lousy sound quality (as others have mentioned), unhelpful bird's-eye camera angles, woeful background set with long, intrusive shadows (bad lighting) from Leslie's gang (who are specifically described as fellow instructors? Really? Then why are two of them wearing huge, unflattering, low-self-esteem black T-shirts - I've been known to hide in these garments myself, but I am NOT a fitness expert!), plus some of the cues are so haphazard, even the ""instructors"" flail their arms goofily trying to catch up at one point.
Sansone can be brilliant - but this walk was incredibly dull, lacks the sort of perky flow between moves that make so many of her dvds a pleasure, and made me horribly aware I was just another broad wearing out the floor in front her tv.",1279065600,2,894,4.849673202614379
2259688,5,B0008JHD2G,"This is a good standard Leslie Sansone in-home walk.  It doesn't use weights, bands, intervals, etc.  She sticks to her basic moves (walking, kicks, knee lifts, side steps, and kick backs)except at the very end where she throws in a few tap-outs. If you only have 30 minutes to excercise, this is a good choice.",1264550400,2,311,4.636363636363637
2259689,4,B0008JHD2G,"This is another 2 mile walking workout from Leslie.  No weighted balls or other props are used, just walking away the pounds here.  You see all the basic steps, plus a couple new ones that Leslie throws in towards the end of the routine, not hard to pick up.

I like this workout, though it's not a favorite from Leslie, the cueing could be a little better.  As other reviewers have stated, sometimes a move isn't called until right when it starts.  Leslie is quite chatty in this one and perhaps gets distracted a little bit, and therefore cues late.  Not a huge deal, it's pretty simple to get back on the right foot.  It is still a fun routine, and I like the music in this workout, though sometimes it's hard to hear it.

I still recommend this though, it's the perfect length, I use this before or after weights, or sometimes on it's own.  I am very grateful to have found these workouts, they have gotten me back on the road to fitness.

Overall, I give this one 4 stars.  Good effort.",1259193600,,991,4.331521739130435
2259690,1,B0008JHD2G,"I have to take part of the blame on this one - I didn't even think that a Walking tape would be in DVD form and purchased it without thinking.  Of course, the advertisement never really said DVD and of course I wouldn't think you would carry a TV and DVD player with you on your ""walk"" with the ""walking tape!""  I'm so disappointed that anyone would make a walking tape on a DVD!  It just doesn't make sense.  You usually walk outside or on a treadmill - not watching someone walk on TV!!!!! What if I didn't have a treadmill or a TV and DVD player in front of the treadmill - do I walk in place?????  Duh. Bad choice Leslie Sansone.  Worst purchase I made on Amazon.com.",1256688000,,671,4.162790697674419
2259691,5,B0008JHD2G,"I had to take a break from working out due to old age, gravity and arthritis in my knees. I used to walk three miles a day with other LS workouts but had to take a lengthy break.  I'm getting back into it again only this time using the two mile workout instead.  I'm loving this one just like all the others that I have.  I also like seeing the changes in the people working out, namely seeing them get thinner! It's inspiring.",1240358400,3,427,4.120481927710843
2259692,3,B0008JHD2G,This was probably one of the best videos I've seen in a while. It's not too difficult and it's not easy either. It's perfect for a morning workout or a supplemental workout if you can't get all of your cardio and fat burning in at once!,1236816000,,236,4.1521739130434785
2259693,2,B0008JHD2G,"I wish I have taken other reviews mentioning low music volume more seriously... This is, in my opinion, a great workout. It is exactly 30 minutes, does not require any equipment at all and is easy to follow. Leslie's personality is right for the job - she trully motivates you without being too perky, annoying or pushing too hard.

But, unfortunately, this DVD has very poor sound and video quality. Sound is just awful. There is noise from the microphone, music is practically inaudible and the voice level is way too high. Camera work is amateurish and there seem to be someone behind the camera that Leslie and group look at and talk to all the time. Picture quality is like an old VHS tape. There are better quality videos on YouTube.

Unfortunately, an opened DVD cannot be returned and now it's gathering dust on my shelf. What a shame!",1229472000,3,843,4.613333333333333
2259694,5,B0008JHD2G,"This is the first Leslie Sansone DVD that I purchased, and I love it! Her group of walkers vary in size, and I like the step-by-step guidance that Leslie gives, especially with this being the first I started with.

Thirty minutes is the just-right amount of time to devote to working out every day. This one helps you to commit to that; most of these movements are easy to do... after owning this for about 10 months, the only steps I still have a bit difficulty with are the quadruple-knee lifts/arms to knees and the tap outs/lunges.

I love it and definitely recommend it for a first-time user!",1228608000,,597,4.518518518518518

2259697,4,B0008JHD2G,This walk video is very good for me. I am sixty-three and I can now do the two mile walk and I feel I am getting great cardio benefits from it. This is my third video of Leslie Sassones and I think she does a great job.,1205193600,,219,3.6808510638297873

2259710,5,B0008JHD2G,"I have been wanting to get back to pre-baby weight and I found Leslie Sansone's walk fun and easy.  I have tried a few of her older DVDs and this is my favorite because it is an effective walk - I lost 0.5-1.5 lbs a week for doing it 4-6 days per week.  It was a bit hard for beginner at first, but once you get a hang of it, it is short (only 30 minutes) and great!",1196985600,,366,3.6794871794871793
2259711,5,B0008JHD2G,Excellent for maintaining good health.  Leslie Sansone is funny and in the know about good walking practices.  The only problem is that I cannot hear the background music on this DVD as well as I can in her 3 mile walk DVD also a great one.  This is not a problem though because Leslie keeps you in tune with the beat.  I would recommend this DVD to anysone.,1193443200,,358,4.220588235294118

Can't go wrong with the basics!",1192665600,2,298,4.155172413793103

2259716,4,B0008JHD2G,"This is a workout consisting of 30 minutes of low impact walking of increasing speed with a few simple moves mixed in.  I'd been hearing about the walking workouts and couldn't imagine how you'd do this at home, so I had to see what it was about.

It was easy to follow, although there were a few spots where Leslie Sansone didn't tell you what you were supposed to do until you were supposed to have started or where she'd get her counting a little mixed up.  She comes across as a little ditsy or forced, but there was one section where she made me laugh.  The time went by fairly quickly, especially considering you're basically walking in place in your own home.

I didn't find the workout very intense, but I did break a slight sweat.  I will probably keep this in my workout library for light days and as a bit of variety from the typical workouts I use regularly, which are The Firm, Tae Bo/Billy Blanks, Richard Simmons, Kathy Smith, Tamilee Webb and The Biggest Loser.  I exercise at least 5-6 days a week and find having a variety of workouts and trainers to help prevent boredom.

I wouldn't recommend this for intermediate or advanced exercisers except for a light or low intensity workout, as I can't say I really felt all that worked out - yet I can't debate I did walk 2 miles in the 30 minutes.  While the simplicity is and can be welcome on some days, I think frequent/regular use of this type of workout would possibly get boring.  Yet is a nice change of pace from the workouts with complicated footwork or even moves that have a learning curve to master.

I would think beginning exercisers would especially benefit from this workout.  You're unlikely to get injured using this 2 mile walk workout and you can use it in any weather.",1187568000,6,1752,4.4576802507836994
2259717,2,B0008JHD2G,"I usually love her workouts, but the camera work is bizarre, I can't hear the music, and she doesn't use the weights at all.  I usually like a little weights.  Clearly an older one.",1186358400,5,181,4.294117647058823

8056378,4,B0008JHD2G,"I bought this program nearly a year ago, but not for myself. My husband, who was my FIANCE when I bought this, was having a hit or miss year. He was having some health issues, so I decided to help him to get better. I helped him to improve his diet, and I'm trying to help get him off of cigarettes. Last year when I was planning my WEDDING, I also went about trying to improve my diet. Unfortunately I have a family who could care less about healthy eating. They are a DIETER'S NIGHTMARE. COMMERCIAL PIZZA, COMMERCIAL FRIED CHICKEN AND FAST FOODS were very much part of their diet and mine. And my Husband keep bring home Pizza. Though I was on an EXERCISE PROGRAM, along with other personal stresses on top of my ""PENDING WEDDING"", with foods like that, I couldn't keep it up. Finally in SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER I caved in, with not so pleasant results.

Fortunately, I was able to wear my WEDDING OUTFIT, which I had bought during the SUMMERTIME. But I didn't ""look"" the way that I wanted to. My husband already knew that I had bought this EXERCISE PROGRAM for him. In fact when I bought this one, I bought several other programs like ""BELLYDANCING"", ""THE FIRM BODY SCULPTING SYSTEM"", and a ""HULA WORKOUT"". I have bought copies of programs like these before, but these were fresh ones that I hadn't tried and I was determined to be at my best. I didn't exercise again until FEBRUARY 2ND OF THIS YEAR. I had mentioned to My Husband, about three weeks ago, that we should get into an WALKING EXERCISE PROGRAM. I then showed him this program. I guess he had forgotten that I had bought this one for him. But I've decided to keep the program for myself. I may as well had bought him ""BATTLESTAR GALACTICA"" with ""LORNE GREEN"". Yesterday, I mentioned to him that we should EXERCISE and he grumbled something about taking a nap. I knew then that this quest to get him to EXERCISE was in vain. Absolutely useless. So for the fourth day in a row, I've EXERCISED BY MYSELF. I DON'T MIND!

I've used LESLIE SANSONE before. I had three of her other WALK PROGRAMS. One of them I want to replace. This is one of her earlier ones, as it has some of her actual ""WALKING INSTRUCTORS"" on this program too. I first saw one of ""LESLIE'S WALKING PROGRAMS"" in the Library and I borrowed it. Unfortunately I don't recall which one it was. I understand that some of her programs are being repackaged and consumers are buying what they think are fresh Programs. I'll try to be careful before I buy anymore of her programs. She start the program with a Warm-Up, but she doesn't cue the Exercisers to when the Program goes from the ""Warm up"", into the ""Workout"". The Exercisers are just cued to move faster. The Program is simple enough to follow, and it goes by pretty fast. Of course LESLIE is as chatty as she always is. I noticed that some of the Exercisers use their arms quite a bit, but LESLIE keeps her hands on her hips more. Well, I move my arms around too. I can't keep my arms still while I'm exercising. It's to early to tell what kind of results I may get from this program. I don't want to give this program five stars because I have only been using it for a short time. In the past I often gave five stars to a program just because I liked it. I would rather have used the program for a significant amount of time, maybe about thirty days, before I should give it such a high rating. At this point I can honestly say I like this workout. I would have to wait awhile to see what kinds of results I get. So, a star for simplicity, a star for length, a star for ""real instructors"" and a star for the genuine like for this program. I probably should have waited the way I did when I bought my ""ZUUMBA PROGRAM"".",1486252800,,3695,4.315107913669065
