1196525,2,B000007NNH,This is an atypical Israeli movie which is not necessarily reflective of Israeli life and hard to relate to characters .,1387929600,,120,4.761904761904762
1196526,5,B000007NNH,"If, as most of us, you lost the love of your life from high school, a flood of emotions will be brought forth by this film. Truly one of the few great films of all times.  This is a movie that Woody Allen would pull his hair at seeing, having learned a few new things, and at amazement that anyone else could capture love and the human dram as well or better than he.",1387756800,,367,3.9594594594594597
1196527,3,B000007NNH,"No doubt this is a very odd film. You will probably either really get a kick out of it or hate it. Plenty of uptight parents will find it too mature for their teenage kids as well, especially in North America which is more Victorian than Israel. The young girl's powers of perception send everyone trying to take advantage, from getting excellent scores on tests to winning the lottery. The girl's powers will disappear if she falls in love. though...",1374969600,,451,4.65
1196528,1,B000007NNH,"Teenagers taking drugs like they're candy, bullies beating up smaller kids, groups of kids making plans to blow up the school. And these were supposed to be 7th graders?

Scenes don't flow smoothly, dialog was erratic. It seemed like I was watching scenes out of order.

I watched for an hour, and kept hoping it would get better. It didn't.

All that and subtitled, too? NOT a pleasant experience.",1372809600,,398,4.739130434782608
1196529,4,B000007NNH,"Set in Israel in 1999, this film follows a group of teenagers as they deal with rebellious urges and the bewitching presence of the new girl in town, Clara. The men (young and old) in this film fall over themselves for her in different ways, and her ability to see the future causes much mischief in the industrial wasteland of a town they all live in. It is essentially a story of young love that is stylized enough to make it truly interesting, but not so much that it becomes a distraction.

I like how strange it is.",1356998400,5,520,4.3061224489795915
1196530,5,B000007NNH,"I'm startled that a film as moving as this one is in danger of out-of-print status.  This unique love story (which garnered numerous awards at international film festivals and won several Israeli  ""Oscars"")is the type of film that should turn heads stateside,  and whose directors should be revered as Israeli Spielbergs, though this is  more interesting than anything HE ever created.  If you havn't seen this,  and if the admittedly exorbitant expense doesn't discourage you, check it  out.  It's worth it.",951004800,3,508,5.185185185185185
7905074,1,B000007NNH,don't recommend. disappointing.  young anarchists took over the film.,1468800000,,69,6.666666666666667
7905075,2,B000007NNH,Disappointing Israeli comedy,1467676800,,28,8.666666666666666
7905076,5,B000007NNH,Excellent movie. Recommend to age 13-100.,1465948800,,41,6.0
7905077,5,B000007NNH,Great movie:),1465257600,,13,6.0
7905078,2,B000007NNH,"Odd and disjointed, just couldn't get into it.",1443139200,,46,4.875
7905079,4,B000007NNH,"Fun story ... slow in spots ... but, worth a watch anyway. I can't give it 5 stars, however, I do give it 4 stars for it's fun idea.",1431907200,,132,3.586206896551724
7905080,1,B000007NNH,Just not interesting or well made. Sounded cool; too bad,1419811200,,56,4.7
7905081,4,B000007NNH,A bit bizarre for my taste but innovative and interesting. Worth watching,1419379200,,73,5.166666666666667
7905082,5,B000007NNH,"I watched this movie back in the day, I love it then, and I still like it quite a bit, this is not your typical, corny, cheesy, coming of age movie; in fact it's a much deeper and complex look in to the life of teenagers... yes people, drugs, sex, vandalism, rebelliousness, kind of comes with the territory... Visually striking, well made little movie, impressive soundtrack...",1397001600,,378,4.742424242424242
7905083,4,B000007NNH,Funny interplay between teachers and students.  Rehash of coming of age themes and disaffected youth.  Definitely worth a look.  Golda on fire was HILARIOUS!,1391990400,,157,5.458333333333333
