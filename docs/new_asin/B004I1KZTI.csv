4381779,1,B004I1KZTI,"This movie, as already mentioned by other reviewers,  was obviously made by people with a total dislike of Thor.

I love both Thor and the Hulk and have been following their encounters since I was a kid. The record of their fights is slightly inclined to Hulk's favor: lots of draws between the two, with 1 or 2 wins for Thor and 3 or 4 wins for Hulk; or something close to that.

Yet in this movie Thor is portrayed as a totally inferior and ineffective adversary for the Hulk. And why is that? Just turn on the commentary feature of the film to hear the makers of the movie ridicule the Thor character and state how much they despise it (this has been mentioned by at least another reviewer of the movie).

I would have been equally disappointed if the Hulk character was the one depicted as badly as Thor was in this movie. As a fan of comics I expect DC, Marvel and the other companies to be aware of the respect they owe to their characters and to us the fans of those characters. In my book that means to portray them fairly and true to their imaginary attributes, qualities and weaknesses. And not to make that portrayal based on biases, personal likes/dislikes and whims of writers, directors or any others responsible for developing the plots or scripts.

This charade of a superheroes animation film is an affront to those of us who appreciate and value the fair depiction of the fictional characters whose publications we have cherished for so many years. The mockery of the Mighty Thor that is so evident in the story and so admittedly true in the makers' commentaries is something that Marvel should have not let happened.

Again I would have disliked this film just as much if the despising and disrespect had been directed against the Hulk. No superhero character should be disrespected like this.

The other aspects of the film are fine: good animation technique, excellent color saturation, great voicing and awesome scenery (the portrayal of Asgard and the Underworld are great).

Too bad all of the effort and work for making this animation feature was ruined by turning it into a spite-release valve of the makers against one of the oldest and noblest characters of the Marvel Universe.

Hopefully the newly found success of the Mighty Thor in its feature non-animated film and in the mega block buster The Avengers will make Marvel aware that they need to be more vigilant to prevent that some buffoons ruin the image (and thus potentially the profitability) of their superheroes.

It makes me wish that Thor was for real so he could do some lightning ass-frying to the makers of this dissapointing animated movie.",1344384000,6,2635,4.683982683982684
4381780,2,B004I1KZTI,"So as I watched this film, and listen to the commentators, I noticed that they're making fun of Thor and enjoyed thrashing him and making him cry like a newborn baby. Here's the thing, yes, the Hulk is out of control and going all crazy, but please tell me, if these are GODS of ASGARD and their race is a powerful race, why the hell even bother making them fight when the Hulk is slapping them around like pesky flies?? I can not believe that Marvel would let these idiots have control of a character (Thor) with an upcoming movie about to release. Has Thor been reduced to just a punching bag? In this cartoon, the Hulk even killed Thor! Is there something wrong here? I'm a Hulk and Thor fan, AND a Marvel fan, but this outlandish piece of garbage is the best way to alienate fans right before the movie! The disrespect of the character Thor has been dully noted in the past years. I think greatest achievement and a kick in their groin is that the Thor movie made almost as much as TWO Hulk movies combined worldwide!",1318377600,5,1021,4.350785340314136
4381781,1,B004I1KZTI,"This debacle of an animated feature portrays Thor in a horrible light.  After watching this (thankfully for free via my local library), I did a bit of 'net research and discovered that some of the folks involved in the making of this cartoon are huge Hulk fans who delighted in Thor's pounding.  Listening to the commentary confirmed this.

Just a bad, bad story.  It would have been so much more interesting if the two main characters had a draw.

The THOR film's success at the box office offers overwhelming evidence that Thor is a very appealing, marketable, and profitable character.  More so than the big green oaf by far.  Now if those in charge at Marvel get it through their thick skulls that this is the case, things will be better for comic fans and humanity.  ;)",1310601600,3,774,4.598540145985401
4381782,3,B004I1KZTI,"After seeing the 'Thor' movie twice, I couldn't get enough. I went out and rented this movie. It was okay. I like both characters, but I was rooting for Thor this time, but the Hulk makes Thor look like a wuss in this movie. Loki channels the Hulk out of Dr. Bruce Banner and sets it loose on Asgard. Will Thor and the gods be able to defeat this monster? You might like HULK VS. THOR!!!",1306108800,,387,4.105263157894737
4381783,3,B004I1KZTI,"My son loves the hulk so I've been trying to get cartoons for my son to watch.  I saw that this was a cartoon, and got it for him.  My son loves to watch it, but I noticed it's particularly violent, and the violence is a bit excessive.  If you don't mind your child watching PG-13 violence vs G or PG violence, this dvd will be okay for you, but if you don't want your child to watch PG-13 violence, I would not recommend having your child watch this dvd.  From my perspective, I enjoy my son watching Planet Hulk more which is also a PG-13 film, but at least the Hulk grows in character in that film.  Here all he does is attack, attack, attack, and fight, fight, fight.  That's good for kids, but not always the best way you want your child to learn to act as a parent.  Still compared to what's out there for your kids to watch, sometimes PG-13 is the lesser of two evils.",1300492800,4,875,4.1117647058823525

8429947,4,B004I1KZTI,"Quite enjoyed this.

Loki abducts Banner, bringing him to Asgard.  Only Hulk had ever come close to defeating Thor.  Using the power of the heartbroken Amora, Loki mystically separated Banner and the Hulk.  Then linked himself to the Hulk and killed Banner.

For a brief time Loki controlled his creation.  Slaughtering many of Asgard's protectors. Only Thor gave him a real fight, enough to shatter the spell linking Loki and Hulk.

Only once he was free did the Asgardians learn what Loki had turned the Hulk into.  Physically he was still the Hulk  - nearly invulnerable, with limitless strength.  But there wasn't any trace of Hulk's personality or Banner's.  Loki's creation was completely mindless.  Loki had turned the Hulk into ""Rage Incarnate"".  Without any guidance or direction, Hulk wouldn't stop until he tore down ALL of Asgard.

Thor and Loki were facing Ragnarok - the end of their civilization.  Their only hope was to journey into the afterlife and find Banner.  Bruce had known the peace of the afterlife, and had the strength to give it up. He merged himself with the Hulk once more.

Banner's sacrifice saved Asgard.",1442793600,,1137,4.931216931216931

8429950,2,B004I1KZTI,"There's not really much to say about this movie, but I'll do my best given the material I've been given.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

First of all, there was no real plot to speak of.  Sure we had Loki possessing the Hulk in order to use him to defeat Thor and destroy Asgard, but we're missing vital pieces of information.  Who is the woman in green he got to help him?  How did he find Bruce Banner?  How did he get Banner to Asgard?  How did Loki convince this chick in green to help him?  Why didn't we see her get rejected by Thor in order to establish at the beginning of this story that that is the reason she is helping Loki?  Why do we have to wait until half way through the movie in order to find this out?

I'll admit it was cool to see that not even Loki, the god of Trickery could control the Hulk, only Banner can do that, and it was even cool to see Thor and Loki fighting the Hulk together and them convincing the god of the dead to let them have Banner's soul back from the depths of Hell.  They really are a good team when they work together.

In the end Banner is re-united with the Hulk and he is able to control him again and he is sent back to Earth because his soul is too destructive to leave in Hell.  Thor then tells the Lord of Dead that her realm has suffered great losses today.  How do you figure?  All that happened was that a few boulders were smashed by the Hulk.  Yeah, I guess they really value boulders in Hell.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

I'll admit the animation was pretty good, and I loved seeing the Hulk as pretty much the avatar of rage incarnate.  And seeing him utterly thrash Thor almost to the point of killing him was pretty cool as well, cuz it once and for all settled the question in my mind of who is mightier, Thor or the Hulk.

I picked this up for five bucks in a bargain bin at my local supermarket so I'm glad I didn't pay full price for what is basically a street fight between Thor and The Hulk.",1367625600,2,2008,4.1827676240208875
