2235376,5,B0007R4T12,The master of terror does not fail us in these tales that warp your perception of reality. The plots and twists are a good tribute to Poe who would have loved to work with Price. I highly recomend this.,1171152000,,202,4.205128205128205

2235380,5,B0007R4T12,"Although Fall of House Usher adhears pretty closely to the original Poe story, Pit and the Pendulumn is not even close(except for the swinging battle axe of a ticker). Peter Thomas(Nova) did a narration/acting on audio that adheared exactly and was quite creapy.(why doesn't anyone release his wonderful radio shows).  Pit and the Pendulumn on screen didn't relate to the Poe telling, but how could it?  A single prisoner in a dingy dark dungeon is not a story for a moviescreen. Dianne Steele is not Myrna Fahey and yet it has been so long since I watched Pit and the Pendulumn that I thought Fahey was in both as generally they both look(and act) like Liz Taylor.  The House of Usher is better, more frighting and very intriguing as far as the ""fall from grace"" type romance tale.  P&P(don't pun I am tired!)  is entertaining enough, if not a bit watered and the B&W scene is just what really happened to this woman(Steele).  The masqued skull of a human face with a look of horror was quite wicked, if not a bit campy but effective at getting the morbid message to us.

I'd definitely get this double feature over the individual movies as they are both quite sinsiter and chilling on a dark night.

Dream sequences are a wonderfully ""evil"" part of HoU too.  I liked the paintings and then seeing the ghostly vistages of these people the way they really were.  I'd try to get the soundtrack too if availible.",1154822400,14,1410,4.581673306772909

2235388,4,B0007R4T12,"This is a two disc horror classic with Vincent Price. They are two great movies, but I was disappointed that The Pit and Pendulum was in Letterbox. My favorite movie of his is House on Haunted Hill. If you are a true horror fan like me this dual disc set is for you.  The movies are both 1 hour 20 minutes, and both are in color. I was more impressed with Pit than Usher, but you may think both are equally great. I wish they made horror movies like they did back in the day, especially when the 70's & 80's came into play. Todays horror movies are nothing but cheese, poorly written, and make the horror genre laughable. I wish the old school horror would return, so looking for a couple of good movies for the price of one this is for you.

2235389,5,B0007R4T12,"That was the title given to a British collection of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories that was published in 1902 and it has been with us ever since. It is also a perfect phrase for describing Roger Corman's 8 movie adaptations of Poe that he did in the early 1960s for American International Pictures. The films are full of mystery and you have to use your imagination in accepting the highly stylised visualizations that these movies are full of. Part of this artistic as opposed to realistic approach is due to the budgetary limitations (the early films were shot in 2 weeks for around $300,000 according to Corman on his excellent DVD commentary). However much of it is deliberate as the director is trying to evoke the spirit of Poe not just render him authentically. Nowhere is this more evident than in the first two Poe films that are featured on this DVD.

HOUSE OF USHER (not preceded by THE FALL OF...) is about 80% artistic and 20% realistic. The nightmarish shots of the house (which resemble 19th century engravings) give way to claustrophobic interiors that are lit in a very theatrical manner. Then there's the artwork itself, very un-19th century paintings of the Usher family which are much more like expressionistic psychological portraits (they were commissioned for the film). Add the distorted lens dream sequences and the intense use of color filters and you have a very different cinematic experience from the CGI and shaky camera affairs that are the norm today for supernatural fare.

Vincent Price, in the first of his 7 legitimate Poe appearances, gives one of his signature performances as Roderick Usher, aristocratic, tormented, but also cruel and cunning. Myrna Fahey  makes for a healthier Madeline than Poe intended but she's very believable. Mark Damon does a good job portraying the romantic lead as he does more than look the part. Rounding out the quartet of characters is Harry Ellerbe (in old age make-up) as the family servant. The hallucinatory imagery of Poe's prose is well captured and this is before the use of LSD became common. Considering the limitations everyone was working under it was and still is a remarkable achievement.

THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM benefits from a larger budget, additional characters, and a different slightly more realistic approach although the concluding sequence with the pendulum is pretty mind bending. There is also the presence of horror icon Barbara Steele. While she doesn't do that much, she lends credibility to the proceedings just because of who she is. And then there's that great final shot. PENDULUM is considered by many critics to be the best of the series. Unlike the Hammer Gothic horrors whose success these films were attempting to duplicate, Roger Corman's Poe adaptations have yet to receive the deluxe treatment the Hammer movies have (this DVD transfer dates from 2001). A new release, preferably on Blu-Ray, would help to bring these movies back before the public in a way that they can be appreciated once again.",1409788800,,3010,4.966269841269841

2235415,4,B0007R4T12,"Another volume of MGM's 2-on-1 discs of classic horror brings us two of Vincent Price's most famous films this time around, 'The Fall Of The House Of Usher' (aka simply 'House Of Usher') and the 1961 version of 'The Pit And The Pendulum'.  Both are based on Edgar Allan Poe short stories, both are adapted by Richard Matheson and both directed by Roger Corman.  This particular clique brought out a lot of good horror mysteries in the 60s.

  In Usher, a young man arrives at the vast manor of the Usher family looking for his missing fiancee, only to find her there very ill and in the care of her older brother Roderick (Price) and the family's servant.  Roderick is mentally unwell, that's easy to see from the start, and his senses seem to have sharpened to a superhuman degree.  Aware of the bloody history of some of the Usher family's more brutal ancestors,  Roderick considers the entire Usher bloodline a bane upon the world, that'll go on to do even greater harm in the future unless it's eradicated, as the recently arrived suitor (Phillip, played by Mark Damon) of Madeline Usher (Myrna Fahey) realizes to his horror, and with the surviving members of the clan present, Phillip fears that Roderick is going to take it onto himself to do just that.  This is one of Vincent's more sympathetic and tragic roles - Roderick isn't evil, just insane, and even through that insanity loves his family dearly, which makes what he's contemplating all the harder.  'House Of Usher' is very well done - certain technical aspects aren't as good as they would have been if done just a decade or so later (it was released in 1960), but the use of color, sound and atmosphere combine for good effect.  The movie works on many levels, and on its own would get a four-star rating.

  In 'The Pit And The Pendulum' - perhaps packaged with 'Usher' because of similar themes - Price is once again subject to paranoia and delusions, this time as Nicolas Medina, son of one of the most notorious and sadistic torturers of the Spanish Inquisition, the late Sebastian Medina.  Price is terrified the cruelty and the madness of his father will pass down through the blood, and though Nicolas is a kindly family patriarch, he fears eventually becoming just like his father.  New events in the family home are indeed threatening to drive Nicolas over the edge - his recently deceased wife (Barbara Steele) is appently haunting the place, blaming Nicolas for her untimely demise.  Or is someone merely trying to make him think his bride has come back from the dead?  Or is it all in poor Vincent's head?  The movie is admittedly too slow-paced for at least the first half of its running time (not a bad first half, but definately could have been punched up a bit) but improves in its latter sections, with a brilliant final fifteen minutes or so that gives us perhaps Price's singlemost memorable moment on film (I believe you'll know it when you see it).  On its own, I'd give Pit And The Pendulum 3-and-a-half stars.  By the way, the 1991 version of The Pit And The Pendulum is so radically different from the Price/Corman one that it shouldn't even count as a remake.  (The original short story was so short that, if filmed literally, it would have been maybe five to ten minutes long, so it was greatly embellished for its filmings, just in different ways).  That version is also very good - totally different story and much bloodier.  It's available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stuart-Gordon-Presents-Box-Set/dp/B000K6MDGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stuart Gordon Presents Box Set</a>, along with 'Castle Freak' and 'Deathbed', for anyone who's interested in seeing both adaptations.

Vincent Price is simply superb. Whatever else one says about these movies, his acting can hardly be faulted.

The DVD is that cost-effective but unsettling ""one movie per side"" design (watch where you put your fingers!), but the display quality is good.

2235420,4,B0007R4T12,"[This review is part of my 31 days of Halloween series.]

I am focusing on HOUSE OF USHER in this review because PIT & THE PENDULUM is not a big favorite of mine, but it's ok for kids--as is HOUSE OF USHER.

THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER is one of the very best productions of the Roger Gorman-Vincent Price horror series. It is based on Edgar Allen Poe's masterpiece, very Lovecraftian & one of my personal favorites.

There are only 4 characters (which was certainly a plus for the budget) & the 4 actors & director Gorman are up to the challenge of making a well-acted & suspenseful film.

The central theme of both the book & the movie is that of a degenerate family line who physically & spiritually poisons not only their own ancestral home, but their very presence also pollutes the environment around them. The current residents are a brother and sister who, although not evil in themselves, are the end of the family line. The sister is prone to attacks of catalepsy & the brother suffers from a really killer case of neurasthenia. Both of these medical conditions were sort of ""in vogue"" near the end of the 19th century.

In its most extreme manifestation, catalepsy can cause a victim to actually appear dead. Fear of premature burial had some people so upset that elaborate precautions were made to prevent such a horrible fate--including above ground burial & a bell alarm system above ground that could be triggered from within the coffin, etc.

Neurasthenia was more of a ""rich person's ailment"" that could be the result of alcoholism, stress, etc. One cure involved electro-shock therapy. In Brother Usher's case it is obviously attributed to family inbreeding & psychosis. He can literally hear a pin fall & it drives him absolutely crazy--as if he wasn't already crazy enough! Vincent Price is in top form as the very afflicted Mr. Usher.

The entire condition of the family has degenerated to such a degree that the house itself is literally falling apart & sinking at the same time. The image of this at the film's conclusion is convincingly portrayed in a stark, expressionist style--as is the weird painting gallery depicting the evil Usher ancestors.

There is a very interesting dream sequence (as in MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH next on my list) that is still very cool to watch.

This is a movie kids can enjoy too.

2235424,4,B0007R4T12,"the razor's edge of destiny"" is what the AIP Poe based film the Pit and the Pendulum is - a combination of good writing (Matheson) good art direction, good acting (Price; Steele; Carbone - I don't believe I said that) and believe it or not good direction (Corman).  Price was at his best in this role (actually two roles) and Karen Steele the Horror Scream Queen never looked finer.  I was very surprised at Carbone in this as I had only seen him in a couple of very low budget pics and I never thought much of what I saw.  I bought this two movie disc for the ""Pit"" as the Fall of the House of Usher I always considered the weaker of the two films (despite the fact it was made first and ""P&P"" was the follow up).  Primarily ""Fall"" tends to drag on a bit too long, both films based on only a scintilla of material relative to what was begat on film.  Nonetheless these were both great works put together by Corman/Matheson and fortunately this dvd (except for the lack of English subtitles) has got some nice extras like commentary from Corman (he actually mentions shooting ""P&P"" in 15 days), trailers and a prologue to the ""Pit"" filmed much later for television release (as a treat watch the prologue than watch the ""Pit""), it'll make you start to think.  To the gentleman who commented about the missing footage of the woman being walled in, I believe it shows up later in a Price flashback sequence as the men are unearthing his wife's remains.  These types of films go well beyond the vomit and blood slasher horror films you see today.  This is what horror was supposed to be and the expansion of these Poe works to movie length doesn't harm the stories as they still feel of Poe's work.

2235428,5,B0007R4T12,"Just about everyone knows that Vincent Price is the king of 1960s/1970s horror films, especially the on screen adaption of Edgar Allen Poe's works. The House of Usher and Pit and the Pendulum are just two films directed by Roger Corman based on Poe stories.

Though Corman's films generally bear very little resemblance to the actual stories, they're still tons of fun to watch. The costuming and set design are rich examples of 1960s/1970s camp, featuring lots of dark gothic torches, light fixtures and artwork. The makeup worn by the ladies looks exactly like what you'll find in goth clubs today.

Price is wonderful in Usher and The Pit, both menacing and tragic as the role requires. Others in the films are equally enjoyable to watch, though they're not exactly Oscar caliber performances.

If you're looking for fun scary movies that can be watched by the whole family, these films are for you. There is little in the way of actual gore, yet the nightmarish storylines and Price's acting send chills right up the spine.

The pairing of ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" is great value for money for Vincent Price and Roger Corman fans alike. But Poe fans may be frustrated by the screenplays which don't have much in common with his works.",1194739200,,1277,4.738738738738738

I remember both movies being screened in our junior high school auditorium as ""noon movies"" which were shown as 15 minute clips each day (like the old serial movies). In an era where special effects have overtaken the role of carefully crafted dialog in building suspense and interest, it is fun to see an ""intellectual"" fright film in its glory.

2235432,5,B0007R4T12,"This series of 2 film DVD's from MGM in their ""Midnight Movies Double Feature"" collection is a great deal. Keep in mind the films is the series may not be MGM pictures, they are just the DVD distributor. The movies are decently priced, and they usually do a good job of matching up 2 movies in a theme. This set is no exception, with two American International Pictures films based on stories by Edgar Alan Poe, both featuring the great Vincent Price and both directed by Roger Corman with screenplays by Richard Matheson, and both feature music by Les Baxter.
First up we have the ""Fall of House of Usher"", from 1960, in color. It is presented in 16x9 Widescreen, and it runs a brisk 1 hour 20 minutes. Screenwriter Richard Matheson gives the Poe story a good treatment with plenty of plot twists, scaring the pants off of us as a family lusting for power is driven to savagery. The Film Daily in its review at the time described the stories ""brooding evil and sinister suspense"". The film was a big hit with the movie going public at the time, hitting the top 5 of box office sales for the year, and encouraged the studio to produce more Poe stories.

Next film is ""The Pit and the Pendulum"", from 1961, in color, presented in 2.35:1 Widescreen letterbox format. This movie is also 1 hour 20 minutes in length and is a fast paced film. The Hollywood Reporter described this film on release as ""eerie and excellent"", and they hit the mark. Corman improved on the formula for Usher, and the Pit was a smashing success. The story builds suspense as British man (John Kerr) visits a castle in Spain, owned by his wife's brother (Vincent Price), in order to investigate her death.  She is played by Barbara Steele. The inquisition has recently ended, but Price fears he has inherited has sadistic and murderous traits of his father, who was an inquisitor.  Price, who also plays his father, was given a more complex role with some meat on it and seems to be enjoying himself. A real spine-tingler, the scenes with the pendulum were incredible. The castle and dungeon scenes are very atmospheric partly due to the talented art design for the set by Daniel Haller.

EXTRAS & DVD ISSUES:: There is an audio commentary by Director Corman for ""Usher"", and the Theatrical Trailer. The ""Pit"" has the original trailer, audio commentary by director Corman who regales us with explanations about his camera trickery and techniques. We are also gifted with a rare prologue filmed for the Pit movie's TV release in 1968.  No insert or booklet included. The image and sound are very clean and appear to be remastered, the colors are bright for the period. The only complaint is, on the DVD I purchased the second movie ""the Pit and the Pendulum"" is on the reverse side, side B. I have other movies like this and it seems to work OK, but on this one it just would not play. I tried it on other players and same story. I did buy another copy later that worked fine. Make sure you at least ""test"" the DVD when it arrives. All in all, I highly recommend this DVD, it is a keeper.",1179100800,29,3059,4.524412296564195
2235433,5,B0007R4T12,"The first two American International-Roger Corman Poe features on one dvd -- great idea, and fine execution.  Corman's commentary is very nice to have as well.  Pit and Pendulum I first saw at a drive in when I was quite young, and the movie scared the hell out of me. These films have high, for AIP, production values, and look great here. My only question is the odd ""theatrical prologue"" for Pit and Pendulum, which is not really explained. I do not recall seeing it on the film's first release. Still, this is a dvd I would highly recommend for Corman and AIP and gothic horror fans.

February 2008 update:  The P&P ""theatrical prologue"" turns out to be something shot for the ABC-TV premiere showing, and has nothing to do with the rest of the film.  Luana Anders appears in the prologue, an interesting bit.  I do wish this information were provided on the DVD!

Also, the reviewers who put this film down have really got to think about the time it was made.  It is really a wild and valid interpretation, and one to savor.",1171584000,7,1029,4.494623655913978

8050758,3,B0007R4T12,"I have always enjoyed Edgar Allan Poes stories, poems, etc, and so when I got this two-pack of two film adaptations of two of Edgar Allan Poes spookiest stories, I was very excited. While both films are great as far as horror films are concerned, and while I would, recommend them, I do have to say that in the case of both films---more so The Fall of the House of Usher than The Pit and the Pendulum---the plotlines of the movies diverge significantly from the original stories---Usher somewhat more than Pit and the Pendulum.
 Regarding Pit and the Pendulum, for instance, while Mr. Corman got the SETTING right (in the sense that it was set in early Renaissance Spain), Edgar Allan Poes original story had nothing to do with a nobleman accidentally burying his wife alive. It was a good, suspenseful, spooky plotline, but it had NOTHING to do with Edgar Allan Poes original story. Poes original story, The Pit and the Pendulum, centers around a man who is sentenced by the Spanish Inquisition to be slowly sliced to bits by a gigantic pendulum (presumably for alleged heresy)---yet in this movie, the plot revolves around a British man---played by an American actor, oddly enough---trying to figure out how his sister got murdered. Yes, it is very common for film adaptations of stories to diverge somewhat from the original book, but here, the changes are not minor changes in dialogue or scenery, but in the plot itself. In spite of these major differences between both of the stories, I still liked both movies because they were still spooky and cool.",1508457600,,1557,4.788104089219331
