5554433,1,B00B361IE2,it reminds me of the old 3 ninjas movies. Except not quite as good. There's some good action scenes but the plot  is awful. and some of the action scenes are just silly,1367625600,2,168,4.090909090909091
5554434,5,B00B361IE2,"If you are into Asian martial arts flicks, this movie will deliver just that! I loved the fact that the entire family where pretty amazing at martial arts. And you can't have a good Asian movie without some comedy which this movie also delivers. I would certainly recommend this movie. Hope you can enjoy it as much as I did.",1367193600,,325,4.433333333333334
5554435,4,B00B361IE2,This movie tries to straddle the line between slightly comedic family film and full on martial arts action film. It succeeds about halfway on both sides of the coin. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable... it IS. Just don't go in expecting Ong Bak or anything resembling Tony Jaa's best work. It's a nice family action film that does its job... and my son loved it so that's all that matters to me. :),1366761600,,401,4.36

5554439,4,B00B361IE2,"Good story about a father and son relationship.  I liked that there was a struggle between what the son wanted to do with his life and what the father wanted for the son and all of his family really.  At first I disliked the father but he became loveable and the wife reminded me of myself.  A bit too much fighting at the end (about 20 minutes straight!) and some really lame parts BUT very much ignorable with all the humorous stuff.  It was definitely better than I thought it'd be and I would watch it again.  I do recommend this to anyone who likes movies about families, fighting or humor.",1410825600,,595,4.324324324324325

5554443,4,B00B361IE2,"I found this looking for JeeJa movies and was at first disappointed she had such a small role. Don't go in expecting much of her and they do tone her down except for in one sequence where we do get to see a bit of her speed, because it is not about her character at all.  She does more sort of down to earth acting here  and is pretty good at it  The center is the South Korean family and this movie is a partnership vehicle for filmmakers of both Thailand and South Korea.  The Martial arts skill of the cast is solid but it lacks the rather painful impact of a Thai film that at times makes me cringe..

It is rather a funny story if you like a dose of corny now and again, which I do.  Plot is thin and with subtitles we do not quite get some of the subplot with the characters going on.  The various TKD fu's the family is supposed to do are entertaining I found it funny enough to pass the time and enjoyed the humor, others may not.  It is a family movie and should be viewed in that vein.  The martial arts are uneven sometimes very good other times the choreography is off a bit with some hokey wire work.  The central character needs music for his inner fighter to shine.  While certainly not award worthy it is funny IMO and the action is acceptable.  I liked the film once I realized what I was in for.  The mom and her sudden alliance with the bad guys equally quick betrayal of them, in the alligator pit may have been favorite part.",1407888000,,1446,4.103202846975089

5554448,5,B00B361IE2,"I waivered between giving The Kick 4 or 5 stars but in the end gave it 5 because I only intended to watch 15 minutes of it before I went to bed and got totally involved in it and stayed up to watch the entire movie.  It was cheesy and not that well acted, but there was something so engaging and entertaining about it.  You wouldn't think a film full of bad guys, knife fights and endangered children would be family friendly, but somehow it is. I recommend watching the ending credits to see the behind the scene NGs/bloobers.",1406851200,,527,4.313131313131313

5554450,3,B00B361IE2,"Overall, it was a cute film. Chances are that's not what you want to see if you're searching for a martial arts film to watch. It was not what I would have preferred. There was certainly a lot of action mixed with corny humor and bad CG. It gets pretty ridiculous at the end. I understand why the movie is called ""The Kick"" because that is all they seem do in this movie. Now, I think I realize I'm more a fan of kung fu than tae kwon do. The moves are not very diverse in my opinion, and I'm left wanting more. I've seen worse, but I still don't know if I'd recommend this film.",1403049600,,579,4.0
5554451,3,B00B361IE2,It's a cool movie about dance fighting style - almost like a bboy martial art. It didn't wow me but entertaining non the less.,1402531200,,126,4.291666666666667
5554452,5,B00B361IE2,Watched it with my husband and am not usually a fan of this type of movie. The choreography was amazing. Just a fun movie.,1400457600,,122,4.125
5554453,4,B00B361IE2,"So I watched this film after reading a splendid review of Mr. H. Bala. I give this film a four star rating not because it's a particularly outstanding film, but because it's entertaining with a feel-good quality that makes up for it's flaws. The script is nothing to write home about, the editing could be better, and if you want to be really picky the villains are a bore. Still, there's a lot of charm and cool action, so my advice is to appreciate the fact that this film does not take itself seriously, and fall for the genuine family dynamics.

I won't rehash the plot, it's been done in other reviews. What I will rave about is that although the acting certainly isn't award worthy in any respect, all the actors who make up the Hyun family really pulled it off. Not only did they all show tremendous dedication to their fight scenes, making one believe that these people knew without looking how to move together, but the family dynamics were equally flawless. The affection and exasperation present in any close-knit, loving family is present to full effect. That's what sold me on the film.

Of course, it's also funny. The comedy bits underscore that you're supposed to just enjoy and not over-think things. It works.

The after credits were also lovely and my favorite bit was when Ms. Kim landed a particularly vicious kick to the other Ms. Kim, and shouted, ""UNNI"" (older sister) and raced to hug her and screamed for ice. It's always nice to see acts of respect and kindness.

I highly recommend this one.",1400198400,2,1519,4.614814814814815
5554454,2,B00B361IE2,If you are so interested in watching a flick where they try to slowly built up the story in the first 15-20 minutes which fails to capture then see well performed martial arts.  This movie is for you.,1399766400,,200,4.2631578947368425

5554456,4,B00B361IE2,I really like the action and martial arts in this movie. The storyline and acting are kinda dorky. I checked this out because it has JeeJa Yanin in it and I think she's awesome. She's not the main character though and doesn't have a ton of scenes. But I definitely liked Na Tae-joo who plays the main character. He has awesome moves. And also Kim Kyeong-suk (who plays his sister). She has definite skills. I'd love to see more of their films.,1398729600,5,443,4.414634146341464
5554457,4,B00B361IE2,i hate reading movies but i really liked this one.  i would watch it again.  great stunts and really entertaining.,1398297600,,114,4.65
5554458,4,B00B361IE2,"The Kick, a Thai/Korean colab, keeps faith with a staple of director Prachya Pinkaew's: phenomenal action beats framed in a weak narrative. Prachya Pinkaew has built up impressive cachet, having guided the likes of Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, Tom-Yum-Goong, and Chocolate to international acclaim. The Kick tracks a Korean family of taekwondo practitioners that immigrates to Bangkok, Thailand and sets up a martial arts school.

The movie opens 28 days away from the Olympic tryouts and with the patriarch, Master Moon Sa-beom (Jae-hyeon Jo), psyched about the opportunity for the fam to win a gold medal. Master Moon is one of them stern, autocratic sorts whose word is absolute and final. He's pushing his oldest son, Tae Yang (Tae-joo Na), to master the particularly difficult tornado kick. This doesn't sit well with Tae Yang. He'd rather be a dancer than a martial artist. In fact, Tae Yang has got an audition on the sly, and this ultimately gets in the way of his taekwondo training. Watch the daddy drama attain combustible levels. But the father-son mad-on is only the sub-plot.

The story's main thrust revolves around the family's foiling the theft of an invaluable Thai national relic - the Kris of Kings - by a well-coordinated gang of thieves. For their intervention, the family is celebrated as heroes. But you just know the big bad entrepreneur (Kwan-hun Lee) - who'd masterminded the heist - is seething and plotting a retaliation.

The Kick's flimsy plot still delivers a bag of treats. The bad guy dramatics are often offset by these injections of humor, with the cast occasionally plying their martial arts to comic effect. I belly laughed all the way thru that scene in which the family is on stage to showcase their taekwondo skills - but the floor proves too slippery.

The draw is the action. The movie trots out a parade of dynamic physical sequences. I appreciate that the actors are all martial arts experts and perform their own stunts. The three principals you must keep your eye on are the high-flying Tae-joo Na, Kyung-suk Kim (who plays his sister Tae Mi), and the always awesome JeeJa Yanin (who comes in around 40 minutes in). Tae-joo Na and Kyung-suk Kim are stupendous whirling dervishes with their speed and their acrobatic spin kicks while Jeeja Yanin - who, based on Chocolate alone, is today my favorite female martial artist - stays more grounded but is as just explosive with her forceful application of Muay Thai. By the way, that's another bonus - that we're treated to side-by-side exhibitions of taekwondo and Muay Thai fighting. But my favorite action set is probably Tae-joo Na's fight scene in which he incorporates hip hop dancing into his taekwondo. It's so silly but also awesome.

Spelling police! Thumbs down on the filmmakers' lack of attention to detail. It's such a tiny thing, but it bugged me for minutes when I saw that poster in the movie promoting the International Museum of Thailand - site of the Kris of Kings exhibition - and ""Museum"" was spelled ""Musume.""

The story is sketchy, the acting is whatever, the spelling falters. Yet, on the basis of how sweet the fight scenes are, The Kick gets 3.5 of 5 stars from me. And do stick around for the closing credits for behind-the-scenes footage of the injuries accrued by the cast and stuntmen. It's like we almost owe it to the cast and crew to watch this footage to acknowledge the hard and extremely dangerous stunt work they'd put in. Respect, man.",1397433600,4,3465,4.844594594594595

Actors did a great job, I'm happy to have come across this movie.  People who say to watch Ong Bak or Chocolate (also two extremely great movies) I feel are not giving this movie credit.
