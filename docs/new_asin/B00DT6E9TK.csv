8597503,5,B00DT6E9TK,Great video to grasp the basic concepts of the infinite banking concept!,1484179200,,72,5.083333333333333
8597504,5,B00DT6E9TK,Was a very inspirational short documentary. Has more expository clips in the special feature section. Well worth it's price when you are trying to understand the material. Inspired me to seek out not only the Becoming Your Own Banker Book from R. Nelson Nash to find out more but also search for the right insurance company. Still looking at the time of this writing but gave a link on how to search for students who are practicing the principles of infinite banking themselves! Great informative DVD!,1471219200,,501,4.837209302325581
8597505,5,B00DT6E9TK,"After watching this video with my husband who is a financial advisor, I was amazed at how Mr. Nelson Nash made this concept
so simple to understand. The good thing is after you purchase the video you can always go back and watch it over and over.
The one comment I keep hearing from those who have been introduced to this concept is ""If I had only known about this sooner""

I personally think that any time beats NEVER.
I would highly recommend this book to EVERYONE who is truly interested in their future. I then contacted ""victor4advice"" for more information and guidance.",1390348800,3,575,4.58252427184466
