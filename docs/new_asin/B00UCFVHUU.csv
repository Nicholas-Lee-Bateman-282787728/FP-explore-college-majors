7035978,5,B00UCFVHUU,One of the greatest television shows ever. Its so sad that it got cancelled way to early.essential,1438300800,,98,4.823529411764706
7035979,5,B00UCFVHUU,"it's a shame THE SENATOR is all-but-forgotten today... it's a terrific series that holds up surprisingly well. It was certainly the best written and acted segment of THE BOLD ONES, and its given the star treatment here in this collection. The episodes haven't lost any of their power over the years, thanks to top-notch acting and slick, intelligent scripts. The interview with Hal Holbrook is not only a delight, but gives some terrific insight into the writing and production of the series.",1435708800,2,492,5.012195121951219
7035980,5,B00UCFVHUU,"1968 - 1972 seemed to be the golden age of television for Universal Studios, where standard TV filmmaking techniques (mostly brightly-lit close-ups of series stars) suddenly exploded into grand visual experimentation, allowing innovative directors like a young Steven Spielberg to play with more audacious techniques.  THE NAME OF THE GAME seemed to be ground zero for this, with THE BOLD ONES and offbeat shows like THE PSYCHIATRIST (from 1970's FOUR-IN-ONE) following suit.  COLUMBO and some of the better MYSTERY MOVIES maintained this bigger-budgeted, quality approach to made-for-TV films, as did NBC's ambitious two-hour WORLD PREMIERE movies, which provided two feature-length pilots for THE BOLD ONES' lawyer series (THE SOUND OF ANGER and THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING), along with A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, the ""Senator"" pilot.  No need to re-state the virtues of the brief but memorable Holbrook series, which, along with Spielberg's DUEL, represents Universal Televison at its creative peak.  Only fly in the ointment of this otherwise wonderful DVD release: A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER seems to be mastered from 16mm elements, resulting in an exceptionally grainy and sometimes overly contrasty image.  Although the movie was intended to have a ""docu-reality"" look, and one can always say the smog is contaminating the film stock for an interesting effect, this is not the way ACAPD was originally presented on NBC back in 1970 (all of U's network TV movies were 35mm Technicolor), at least not to the best of my knowledge.  I haven't checked out the remaining hour episodes, but I'm sure they look better, since they played perfectly fine on their recent COZI TV airings, and I'm sure these are the same masters.  Regardless... ""The Senator"" is a landmark television series, and this collection is most appreciated.",1435536000,11,1828,5.2827586206896555
7035981,5,B00UCFVHUU,"I am thrilled with the news of this vintage, acclaimed drama's official release.  ""The Bold Ones"" was a well crafted, thought-provoking series all around, as I distinctly and joyfully recall from seeing it first run.  ""Hmm,"" I wondered in 1970.  ""He's not a cop, not a doctor, not a lawyer, not a p.i; not a western rancher, sheriff or cowboy.  The lead character is [pause for effect] a politician?!""
I wish there were more details here (and on the Shout! Factory website) about Hal Holbrook's interview.  I'm quite upset there isn't a ""sit down"" with Sharon Acker -- you know, the beauty who Lee Marvin and John Vernon fought over in ""Point Blank"" -- who had the pivotal role as Holbrook's supportive and equally smart wife, Ellen Stowe.  Cindy Eilbacher (Lisa's sister), who played their daughter, would have also been a logical and welcome addendum to Holbrook's and Acker's reflections, despite her young age at the time of filming.  We lost the other regular, the wonderful Michael Tolan, who died four years ago.  Tolan turned in excellent work in his role of Sen. Stowe's aide.
One discrepancy between Amazon's specifics here and Shout!'s is the DVD's total running time:  Amazon states 483; Shout 520.  Perhaps Shout is including, in its DVD running time total, Holbook's interview -- if Holbook's interview lasts 37 minutes.  On that vital subject, running time(s), for all us TV ""purists,"" I hope Shout! is releasing the full, as-NBC-broadcast versions, complete with opening ""teasers"" intact and correct-for-the-era Universal logo -- and NOT Universal's syndicated prints with generic main titles and clipped running times and aborted company ID.
Allow me to digress and reminisce about the provocative 'A Continual Roar of Musketry.'  In the series' only two-parter Sen. Stowe (Holbrook) investigates and leads the U. S. Senate's investigation into a campus protest shooting, obviously -- and respectfully -- ""ripped from the headlines"" from the previous May's tragedy at Kent State University.  From the audio tape of the original broadcast that I'd made while a high school senior I was mesmerized by the teaser's editing, its building-to-a-climax, that compelled viewers to stick around for the next hour.  ""Pigs off campus!  Pigs off campus!  Pigs off campus!"" shouted the unarmed students, protesting the Vietnam War and other contemporary ills of our country, and crossing their once idyllic campus lawn in the direction of the nervous, but ready-for-anything National Guardsmen, many the same age as the threatening students.  And then!  A barrage of gunfire and a quick cut to black while the sound of deadly shots continues and leads immediately into ""The Bold Ones'"" (catchy) main title.  Wow.  ""Yeah; better watch the whole episode,"" I thought.  I'm anxious to see if ""it still plays; still holds up.""
Finally, on the subject of gunfire, I note with extreme interest and anticipation that according to its website, in September Shout! debuts ""The Senator's"" predecessor in ""The Bold Ones'"" wheel, ""The Protectors.""  This was a cop show starring a deadly serious Leslie Nielsen plus Hari Rhodes, another good actor, and one of the few blacks who got to be a lead in a network drama.  In the wheel format of ""The Bold Ones"" these crime fighters rotated with ""The Lawyers"" and ""The New Doctors"" segments.  But this was a time of great changes and challenges for the U.S. and broadcasters, the latter beholden to the FCC.
In the 1968-69 and 1969-70 seasons and for a few years beyond the networks were continually harassed and crucified by the quick-to-point-fingers of real U. S. senators.  Much of Washington quickly and stupidly blamed our nation's ills -- most specifically 1968's political assassinations, plus on-going inner-city riots, the Tate-LaBianca murders -- on TV violence.  As an avid TV fan/historian in that fascinating era I was witness to how it crippled the industry by neutering a number of series and TV movies.  And outright cancelling some hours, like ""The Protectors"" here, and, more infamously, ""The Wild Wild West.""  The latter, a true, sacrificial lamb in the spring of '69.
So, Leslie Nielsen and Hari Rhodes experienced having their episode order clipped from 8 hours to 6 hours and then being cancelled outright.  This had a direct result on ""The New Doctors,"" getting bumped from 8 to 10 episodes.  And a renewal.  No potential for perceived or imagined violence in the corridors and operating rooms of ""The New Doctors'"" research medical facility.
Ironically, in the world of Holbrook's courageous and idealistic Sen. Stowe he surely would be the one defending ABC's, CBS' and NBC's and their content providers' First Amendment rights while shaming all his simplistic, grandstanding peers.  And ""The Bold Ones: 'The Protectors'"" would have shared a second season with its esteemed partners,""The New Doctors"" and ""The Lawyers,"" at 10 o'clock Sunday nights in 1970-71.
The umbrella name of ""The Bold Ones"" was used throughout the dazzling main title along with still photos and footage representing the leads of all three rotating hours.  And then after the first commercial and at the beginning of Act I viewers see the episode title and its key credits.  But, the titles ""The Protectors,"" ""The Lawyers"" and ""The New Doctors"" were nearly insignificant.  Viewers said at the time, ""We're watching 'The Bold Ones.'""  I don't think the show was ever marketed or publicized by its representative subtitles, today used by sites like IMDB.
TMI here, perhaps.  To real fans, I hope not.  I can't wait to see this new release of a classic show from a complicated, disturbing era.  Thank you, Shout! Factory.  And I look forward to reading any press interviews Holbrook offers related to his stellar work here.  Meanwhile someone needs to track down Sharon Acker and Cindy Eilbacher for their deserving points of view and recollections of ""The Bold Ones.""",1434153600,11,5898,5.102083333333334
7035982,5,B00UCFVHUU,"I remember this short-lived series as being exceptionally well-written, dealing with timely issues in ways that pushed past what network TV would generally allow at the time. Having seen it again recently on one of those retro-TV channels, it was clear that my memories weren't tinged with hazy golden nostalgia -- it really WAS that good. So it's wonderful to have the series released on DVD at last.

If Hal Holbrook's character Hays Stowe was somewhat idealized, it wasn't beyond belief; and in fact it wasn't that far from some young liberal politicians of that tumultuous era. Certainly he was the sort of man we wanted to represent us! And the series actually handled the issues of the day in a reasonably fair way -- again, for network TV. The boundaries were being stretched then, younger writers energized by their (our) generation had a chance to express new ideas & explore the nature of patriotism, conscience, duty, reform, zealotry ... and also acknowledge the limitations of working within the system, the compromises that had to be made in order to institute necessary changes.

But while the series can be enjoyed as a time capsule, capturing at least some of the zeitgeist of the late 1960s/early 1970s, that's not the only reason to watch it. It's simply an exceptional TV show -- sensitive, complex, dimensional. And in some ways, the restrictions of network TV actually work for it, in that it can't use gratuitous sex, cynicism & violence as a substitute for story -- so you get genuine human drama. (Not that you can't have good stories about sex & violence, it's just that too many TV shows today use them as the automatic default, without really placing them in greater human context, i.e, showing purely gratuitous scenes simply because they can be shown now.) In any case, it's well worth owning & watching -- once the set is officially released, I'll extend this review for the DVDs themselves (see below).

6/23/15 -- Having received my DVD set & watched a fair amount of it, I'm happy to say that the episodes hold up beautifully, and in fact are still quite applicable to the present. Let me call attention to the fine work of the underrated Michael Tolan as Hays Stowe's friend & advisor Jordan Boyle, as well as Sharon Acker's subtle, empathetic portrayal of Stowe's wife Ellen. The writing is consistently sharp & intelligent; the decision not to use any background music emphasizes the dialogue & acting; and the look often has an almost documentary quality to it. However, the episodes have not been remastered, so be prepared for a more old-fashioned TV picture quality.

The pilot film ""A Clear and Present Danger"" is included with the series episodes, offering both a look at Stowe as a man poised to run for the Senate, and as one of the first TV programs to delve into the dangers of pollution. The direction, with its overlapping images & use of both mechanical & organic sounds mixed into the subtle undercurrent of music, has an artistic & lyrical quality. To some younger viewers, this might seem like an extended Very Special Episode before such things existed & became the bane of weekly television; in this case, however, I feel the earnest tone works. The picture itself is rather grainy & washed out, though given the subject matter of polluted air, this may actually enhance the visual punch. Again, younger viewers used to HD clarity may be put off -- but that shouldn't take away from the writing, which is what always counted most on the series as a whole. There's no neat, satisfactory ending, but rather a sense of tension, a fear of futility, a glimmer of wary hope.

Let me especially applaud the 2-part story ""A Continual Roar of Musketry"" which was aired just a few months after Kent State -- and it also references both Jackson State & Orangeburg whenever mentioning Kent, to remind viewers that campus shootings weren't just a one-time anomaly. The characters themselves quickly address & dismiss the usual default approach that any other TV drama of the time took -- blaming everyone equally & treating the incident as a tragedy, almost a force of nature rather than the failure of human responsibility. Here, whatever the excesses of the students (mostly rhetorical), the responsibility for the killings clearly lies with those in authority. This was a brave stance to take then, and one that probably would never be allowed today.

The final disc also offers a recent interview with Hal Holbrook, as well as an episode of his appearance on ""The Dick Cavett Show"" shortly after the demise of the series. These bonus features are an unexpected delight, especially for a program that very few people ever expected to see again. It's a reminder of just how good network TV could be at one point in the past, and definitely required viewing for anyone who cherishes TV entertainment for thoughtful adults. Most highly recommended!",1433894400,19,4890,4.8433014354066986

8705352,5,B00UCFVHUU,"I saw the NBC pilot TV movie ""A Clear And Present Danger"" when it first aired way back when. I was a teenager in high school, but could tell that it was both a smartly written tele-film and a very differently made film. Strong images with double-exposures, industrial sounds. Very interesting. It was worth getting the whole series just to watch this breakthrough TV film again. Thinking about it, I think I will pop it in again when I get home. Highly--HIGHLY--recommend!
Technical points: the TV series episodes are extremely clean. The TV pilot movie looks like it might have come from a 16mm print. Or possibly it was shot in 16mm to give it the grainy docu-quality. Though would be highly unlikely of Universal to have done anything in 16mm back then.
Well, well worth it. Brought back memories. Could see myself sitting in a chair in my childhood room and watching it for it's World Television Premiere.",1486512000,2,909,4.723270440251572
8705353,5,B00UCFVHUU,A very good show ahead of it's time,1476921600,,35,3.5
8705354,5,B00UCFVHUU,"This was a blind purchase for me as the final episode aired before I was born. I'm an old TV buff though & had heard of THE BOLD ONES series.

I don't even care for political dramas but I'd give THE SENATOR the highest recommendation!  Strip away the dated fashions & you have a superb drama with issues that are still topical in 2016. The acting & directing are top notch. Hal Holbrook is perfect here. The writing is smart & the production gives the show more of a movie feel rather than a tv show.  The main extra is a new interview with Holbrook. It's fascinating to watch as he clearly had a passion for the show.

Video quality is good on all episodes except the pilot. It looks pretty worn but each following episode looks good. It's not on the level of the best 70's remastered shows but it's good. I'd give the video quality a C+  and the audio a B. It's sad that studios don't recognize the historical value of film & TV & make preservation more of a priority.

Definitely give this wonderful snapshot of the early 70's a look.  I was very impressed.",1461369600,,1060,4.296482412060302
8705355,5,B00UCFVHUU,"This was a fantastic series, and I was pleased to be able to obtain it at such a reasonable price. The acting is superb. I would recommend this to anyone who remembered this excellent show and wants to relive the episodes in it.",1458864000,,228,4.325581395348837
8705356,5,B00UCFVHUU,As great as I remembered it!,1453680000,,28,3.8333333333333335
8705357,4,B00UCFVHUU,This is a very good set. I love these old well thought out tv shows. However one episode on disc 1 has a severe sound issue. I think it was the second episode. I had to turn the volume up to max to hear it and it still sounded terrible. I think this is a mastering mistake and not a mistake on the tapes used.,1453680000,,309,3.769230769230769
8705358,4,B00UCFVHUU,"One of my favorite shows of the era, but 1 point off for using edited source material (for instance, the opening scene from ""To Taste Of Death But Once"" is not included).  Grateful to have the show released in this full series format, despite the limitations.  Looking forward to the upcoming release of ""The Lawyers"" and the chance to see ""The Invasion of Kevin Ireland"" after so many years.",1449187200,,392,4.666666666666667
8705359,5,B00UCFVHUU,"This series deserves five stars, and Shout Factory deserves praise for making it available. The eight episodes have been available on the collectors' market (i.e. bootlegs recorded from television), but the pilot movie, ""A Clear and Present Danger,"" has remained elusive to even the most die-hard collector. Even the somewhat grainy print of the pilot that's in this set deserves to be celebrated.

""The Senator"" is a superb series that deserves to be rediscovered. However, it needs to be noted that, while the pilot is uncut, the eight episodes are edited-for-syndication prints. Right after watching the pilot movie, I started to watch the first episode of the series, and I thought, ""Where's the opening scene?""

The first scene of that first episode (""To Taste of Death But Once"") originally featured Erin Stowe (Sharon Acker), the Senator's wife, doing a PSA, which is interrupted by a phone call from a man threatening the life of Hays Stowe (Hal Holbrook). The print that is on this DVD set begins with the next scene, which is Mrs. Stowe being questioned by the police about the phone call. (I bought a complete print of this episode from a collector years ago.)

Each of the episodes runs a little over 46 minutes, which means about three to five minutes of each episode is missing. The other ""Bold Ones"" set 'The Protectors' starring Leslie Nielsen and Hari Rhodes has the same problem, an uncut pilot film and edited episodes.

Still, don't let this stop you from purchasing these DVDs. We're fortunate that they're available at all, but it would have been nice if Shout Factory had put some kind of disclaimer on the DVD box to let consumers know that they are not getting the complete episodes.

With that said, I was thrilled to have a new half hour interview with Hal Holbrook discussing the show, along with a brief excerpt from a 1970s talk show appearance and a minute-long 1970s PSA featuring Holbrook.

There is no episode guide included with the DVDs, just a list of the titles and air dates. Here's a complete list of the contents:

8705360,5,B00UCFVHUU,I enjoyed this DVD very much. Anything that takes me back to 1969-1971 is always a special treat for me. The projects from Universal during this time have a certain look and feel. I love it.,1441065600,,190,4.305555555555555
8705361,5,B00UCFVHUU,"I remember the ""Bold Ones"" from when I was in high school. Living in the Washington, D. C. area at the time, ""The Senator"" was one of my favorites. It was cutting edge drama and, in some respects, it still is. (The episode ""Someday They'll Elect A President"" is as relevant now as it was 40+ years ago. Very scary and chilling political stuff.)

Hal Holbrook was fantastic!! I wanted Hayes Stowe to run for office for real....still do! The Holbrook interview on disc three was interesting and eye-opening. Who would have guessed that Holbrook was as ultra-conservative as Hayes Stowe was ultra-liberal?!? Just shows what a great actor he is.

""The Senator"" should have lasted more than 8 episodes. It must have rustled some very high-up political feathers for it to have been so well received by the public and canceled after only one season.

From a technical aspect, it would have been nice to have seen the transfer to DVD done better. The digitization was not done at all well. It has the look of a first-generation copy of a VHS tape. However, the quality of the stories and the acting make up for the poor transfer to DVD. All in all, this is a ""keeper"" in my video collection.",1439078400,,1183,4.570754716981132
