Ordered the DVD, and watched part 1 again, then loaned to a friend.
Still haven't seen 2 or 3 yet, but am looking forward to it.
Would highly recommend it.

4649586,5,B005BYBZEK,"This 3part mini-series helps us understand how our brain works and why. Product includes all 3 episodes. Excellent!
Makes learning easy & fun. I wanted to show part as a sermon illustration, needed it quickly. Seller was true to his word, got it to me in time, in perfect condition.",1322956800,2,282,4.66
4649587,5,B005BYBZEK,I watched the three shows on television and had to get the DVD to share with people. I'm a substitute teacher and used two of the shows on days when the teacher I was substituting for wasn't able to provide a lesson plan. The students watched intently and wanted to see more. I also bought one as a Christmas gift.,1322438400,5,314,4.25
4649588,5,B005BYBZEK,"This dvd series is excellent.  Whether the viewer is a student of psychology or has an interest in how the brain works, I highly recommend it.",1322352000,,142,4.461538461538462
4649589,5,B005BYBZEK,"I am a high school teacher... I teach AP Psychology and Criminology. The three disk set is a wonderful addition to both of these courses. Difficult psychological concepts are taught and explained (McGurk Effect, change blindness, selective attention, perceptual constancy,rubber hand illusion, etc.) thoroughly, but the best feature of the videos is that they are so interactive in nature. Instead of sitting passively during the video, the viewer is encouraged to play along with various interactive ""brain games"". My students especially loved the brain games that forced them to become witnesses to a crime scene. Many were surprised how fallible their memory was during the line up task.

Highly recommended for any psychology teacher, or any one else who desires more insight how the brain works.",1322265600,76,800,5.349206349206349
4649590,5,B005BYBZEK,Just what I was looking for!  I cannot wait to use segments of it in my classroom.  I believe students will find it quite informative.,1321488000,4,134,4.32
4649591,5,B005BYBZEK,I watched it on NatGeo channel with my kids. We all enjoyed it very much. It has a great mix of science with some interesting and illustrative exercise to demonstarte their point. One of the best science/education show that I have seen.,1318550400,23,236,4.642857142857143
4649592,5,B005BYBZEK,"This day and age even our documentaries often get ""dumbed-down."" Shows about the natural world, for example, are filled with close-ups of extreme snake-handlers or tornadoes, and it often seems that about the only documentaries that capture the general public's fascination are ""shark weeks.""

However, National Geographic's Brain Games is a wonderful exception. Smart and engaging, the three episode series looks at the way our brain works, demonstrating how the brain processes information and stimuli and how that shapes how we look and interact with the world around us. The world is complicated, and our brain works extremely hard to process and make sense of it. Most of the time, it's successful at helping us cope with others and the world around us, but sometimes it fails. And, thanks to recent advances in cognitive science, we are able to examine (and learn from) failure-cases like never before. Sounds complicated and boring, but Brain Games isn't. There are at least 15 interactive experiments that the viewer can participate in throughout each show. These aren't boring math problems, but rather truly interactive experiments; many will leave you in complete surprise when the the results are revealed. (For example, did you manage to notice the error I did in the previous sentence?) If you didn't, it's because our brain is constantly shaping the world around us so that it makes sense to us, and assumed there should only be a single ""the"" there instead of two.

Brain Games doesn't try to cover the implications of the scientific studies they highlight, (and it shouldn't, as that would be an entire series unto itself) but these are of immense importance and have real, practical consequences. Our belief systems are based on the way our brains look at and construct the world, and so, for example, we believed for thousands of years that the sun revolved around the earth. Even now, our common disagreements on contentious, incommensurable issues such as abortion, (Does life begin at birth or conception?), may be traceable at least in part to the way our brains help shape and construct our beliefs.

Do yourself a favor and grab this DVD. Brilliant job by National Geographic.",1318550400,148,2201,5.0578512396694215

4649634,1,B005BYBZEK,"I was very disappointed with this series. Especially the one called Law of Attraction. How about a homosexual Law of attraction. What do gay men find attractive in other gay men? Not all men want to get it on with the opposite sex. Or how about a law of attraction with money. I would rather be luckier with money and not so much with women. I ride the buses of Orlando, Florida's bus system. There are some fugly (fat and ugly) women riding them. These are the kind of women that make me say ""I have no trouble controlling myself.""
My big complaint about this series is that it has no productive value. I want to know how to attract more money, not how to attract the opposite sex. Money is what I need, not women that harsh the eyes when you look at them.",1476403200,,757,4.227586206896552

4649673,2,B005BYBZEK,"This show consists of nothing more than the kind of trick pictures that fascinated you as a ten year old (is this a picture of an old woman or a beautiful young girl? It's both, depending on how you look at it! Wow!). The point is to demonstrate that motion fools the mind into all sorts of erroneous assumptions. Okay, it's tolerable, and my 4 year old was enthralled...until...the show asked us to count the number of road signs in a video of a car driving down the road...and then a terrifying green demon popped up directly in front of the view. My kid was scared out of his mind, and rightfully so. I don't know what the point of that vile trick was, but let's keep in mind that this show is rated TV-G.

They basically beg me to play them, and I really enjoy them as well. They really make you think and some of the facts really blow all of our minds! I like how when the experts and scientists explain stuff so anyone can understand it, even my 5th graders. Their favorite parts are the illusions and games that they can play along with the DVD. They are a great way to understand the concept and see it in real time. I give Brain Games a HUGE 5 stars!!",1452729600,,619,4.081967213114754

Its always the brain does this, the brain does that. But its your mind that does everything. The brain is just a tool your mind uses. Its not the brain that is in control  its the mind. The brain is just an organ  like a heart or liver. A very important and vital organ  but still just an organ.

Think Mythbusters meeting The Straight Dope meeting Ripley's.  As such, while the science is kept approachable, there's only so much rigor that can be brought to a 22 minute show.  It's enough to whet the appetite and, hopefully, create some curiosity and incentive to do more research on the topics brought in.

Season 2, was thoroughly polluted with the same old diatribe about evolutionary psychology and how you are a mere chemical sum of your programmed responses and really gets old fast. Don't get me wrong, you still get a lot of good thinking from it, but its polluted by ""factual"" assumptions from science that hasn't figured out its job isn't to know, it's to discover and it proves itself wrong year after year. Season 2 really turned me off from the series after about episode 3-4 when everything de-volved and I promptly removed it from my cart after viewing on Netflix. I can't imagine Seasons 3 or 4 are better. Nat Geo had a great great thing until they let modern ""science"" claim completely unnecessary territory... again. FYI, I hold degrees in Biology and emphasized my electives in psychology general and physiological psychology, so this was not new material or thinking arena for me.

They have a psychologist to ensure accuracy on the show but they also find ways to present the work in an entertaining way while maintaining accuracy. They present the principle and demonstrate the principle. To lighten up the video, they have a professional magician that does tricks that are somewhat related to the principle but are really more for entertainment.

4649865,1,B005BYBZEK,"The production of this show and its entertainment value is 4 to 5 stars. Its value as any form of education or enlightenment is 1 star.
The problem is that the creators have chosen to use psycho babble to explain Matter and Energy Physic Law phenomena.
This is Most prominently apparent in the Watch This! episode where it is stated that the brain imposes colors on the world. This CAN be proven and IS proven to be TOTAL psycho babble NONSENSE.
In the end.... the viewer is left believing that the mind creates reality and nothing the five sense can detect is real.

History tells us very clearly that when psycho babble and ignorant theories are used to explain physics phenomena, the result is.... delusion, schizophrenia, and superstition.
All of this is summed up in one word.... Tribulation.

The show uses numerous deceptive and distractive tactics to achieve tribulation.
The show is entertaining and worth watching.... BUT.... it is NOT Wise or Rational to believe the explanations given.
The show CAPITALIZES upon ignorance of Physics laws. (common ignorance)

I personally went through the trouble to produce physics experiment proof that I am not sharing an opinion. (after all, that is my profession)

I'm not sure they should have included these illusions in the show, seeing as they're not really ""brain games""

If you supply the brain with much less information than it really needs to work properly, guess what: The brain isn't going to work properly. L large part of the class of forced perspective illusions are not illusions at all in the real world. You'd know exactly what is going on immediately, given depth perception.

I suppose what i'm trying to say is that the ""no s***"", easily predictable class of illusions shouldn't be in the show at all. They seem ultimately pointless.",1370131200,,778,4.589928057553957

4649918,5,B005BYBZEK,"Many believe they can multi-task. The experts in this program have found that few actually can - our brain operates on only 12 watts of energy and has been programmed to make efficient use of that limited power. The bad news is that we don't realize that our performance is being impaired attempting to multi-task; similarly, we don't realize what we don't notice.

Only recently has multi-tasking become an issue - up until about 150 years ago or less there was little opportunity to try and multi-task. Experts estimate 2,500 deaths/year due to talking on cell phones while driving.

Another interesting segment demonstrated the ability of hypnosis to erase concepts - eg. the #4 or the ability to read English, or even to believe one is warm while in a freezing environment.",1340150400,4,777,4.878787878787879

I did not expect to be bowled over with a lot of new information but I did expect brain games to be interesting and fun. Instead the narrator/host was a drag and the lame mind games were a drag. Albeit there were lots of colors, magic tricks, and men in monkey suits but all of that was just fluff. The program is informative but the way it is presented is a turn off.

4649925,5,B005BYBZEK,"There are subtle ways in which our highly evolved brain can be fooled.  Sometimes, the result is just amusing, as when a magician deceives us.  At other times, the way our brains work can endanger our lives, and those of others.

Watch this video and you will understand why you cannot concentrate on more than one thing at a time, even though you think you can.  Multi-tasking while driving can kill you, or someone else.

Our brains model our world, and we often see what the brain expects to see, not what actually exists.  For example, motorcycle accidents often occur because other drivers are not expecting to see motorcycles -- our brains may not ""see"" the unexpected, and this effect is exacerbated when we are distracted (e.g., talking on a cell phone, texting, looking at the screen of a smartphone, arguing with a passenger, or just thinking about something other than our driving).  Have you ever driven past your exit because you were thinking about something else, or listening intently to an interesting recorded book?

As another viewer illustrated, we often miss typographical errors when reading, because our brain filters them out.
