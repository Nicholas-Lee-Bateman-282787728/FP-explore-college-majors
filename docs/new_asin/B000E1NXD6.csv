8104247,4,B000E1NXD6,Great DVD with an episode from many of the popular Teenick shows. I haven't seen Unfabulous or Romeo in such a long time! I enjoy watching reruns of these teenick shows. It's too bad there aren't any new episodes anymore from the shows on the DVD,1353715200,,246,4.369565217391305
8104248,1,B000E1NXD6,"I'm still waiting for Nick to release the old school teen shows that were actually good. I'm talking Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, Doug, Are You Afraid Of The Dark, All That (Original Cast), Double Dare, etc. WHERE ARE THEY? I think everyone wants those more than these crappy new shows. Can I get an amen?",1152057600,15,307,4.5
8104249,4,B000E1NXD6,"This is the first DVD offered by Teenick (the teenage portion of Nickelodeon on Sunday nights) and it is part of the Nick Picks DVD collection along with Nick Jr Picks.  Anyway, this DVD includes five different shows and three of which are premiering for the first time ever on DVD.  The shows include:

Zoey 101- Prank Week

My rating: *****/5

Drake and Josh- We're Married

My rating: ****/5

Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide- Computer Labs/ Backpacks

My rating: ****/5

Romeo!- Good Press

(I don't watch this show.)

Unfabulous- The Little Sister

My rating: ****/5

The only thing about this DVD that really annoyed me (and forced me to deduct a star from it's rating) is the fact that it has absolutely no special features whatsoever!  There aren't even subtitles!  At least you're able to select which episode you want to see if you don't feel like watching them all or pressing the ""skip"" button the the remote control.

If you enjoyed this DVD, you may also want to check out the following DVDs as well: Drake and Josh Go Hollywood, Drake and Josh: Suddenly Brothers, and Zoey 101: Spring Break-Up!",1147219200,22,1117,4.769633507853404
