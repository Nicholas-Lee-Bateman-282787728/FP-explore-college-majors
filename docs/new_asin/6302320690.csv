7824285,5,6302320690,"Neil is a family favorite, we want to own every concert, every cd he's made. This one Neil Diamond: Love at the Greek is exceptionally amazing.",1327363200,,143,4.538461538461538
7824286,5,6302320690,"Anyone who has followed Neil's Music & Career- will be most aware that "" The Greek Theater"" Shows are among his most cherished Tapes & DVD's & CD's. I was actually adding to my collection. And was not disappointed in this VHS- there are parts of those shows- that were rarely video taped- and some of the best footage had not been offered to "" The Fan Base""- the only thing that circulated was "" Bootleg Copies."" Most of which are pitifully recorded- since they are illegal. That was my reasoning for purchasing this Tape. And I will say to other "" True Fans""- you might want to add to your collection as well!",1326326400,,610,4.359649122807017
7824287,5,6302320690,"Being a New York City girl, I have grown up with Neil Diamond's music in my subconscious.  His music was always on the radio ever and I have literally been a fan from the time I came to understand the meaning and intent of words themselves.  But this is the first Neil Diamond recording I have ever purchased.  It was delightful.  I enjoyed his playfulness with the audience and how he masterfully delivered his talents. I especially enjoyed ""I am...I Said"". Watch how his eyes sparkle as he sings and listen to how beautiful his voice is.  This is is a real treat for any fan.  I hope that it becomes available on DVD and that other clips from this magnificent series of concerts are included.  Wishing on a star.",1287792000,,714,4.446153846153846
7824288,3,6302320690,"I have seen Neil in concert and watched many concerts on TV, VHS or DVD. I must say that I don't believe he puts forth his best performance here. There is not much edge to the show. Even his attempt at getting the star studded audience involved is somewhat contrived. He seems to labor though many of his songs and ""speak"" sings in a more subdued voice rather than letting his powerful voice grab the audience by the gut and not let go. This is not true on all songs. For example, he seems his old self on Holly Holy and Brother Love has some pop. There is no problem with the sound itself or the video. Although it's my own fault, I wasn't as pleased with the choice of material as one might be. As far as I'm concerned, this was not as good as I hoped. I love Neil, maybe next time!

7824289,5,6302320690,"This VHS is a wonderful treat. This is a truly great live concert video. You will never see Neil Diamond sing like this again as he did in 1976 at his prime. In this landmark performance the songs are true to their original melodies and so exciting. The program runs for a wonderful 52 minutes. The music is timeless. The songs include:

Cherry Cherry

Sweet Caroline - such a sweet melody gives me chills

Play Me - another great melody

Beautiful Noise - a nice beat

Street Life

Lady Oh

If You Know What I Mean - full of emotion

Song Sung Blue - fun with the audience & Helen Reddy(terrific)

Cracklin' Rosie - the audience can't sit down, so much beat

Holly Holy

I Am...I Said

Brother Love's Traveling

Salvation Show

I've Been This Way Before

7824290,3,6302320690,"I grew up listening to Neil Diamond. I used to have the Double LP of this concert. To be honest, I was a little disapointed with this viedo. It isn't because of the performence, Neil diamond himself is always great. It's cool seeing him in a concert that was filmed nack when I was 12 years old.
I would have given this a 4 star rating if at least it included the fifteen minute medley ""Johnathan livingston seagull"" that is on the CD.
I expect more than this. It should have included the whole concert instead of the edited for TV version. The fault lies with those who edited the viedo-not with Neil diamond. He himself gets 5 stars-but the video gets 3 stars.",1049673600,9,662,4.346774193548387
7824291,5,6302320690,"This performance by Neil Diamond is a perfect example of his dynamic, warm, personable on-stage presence. It reflects his ability to relate to and captivate his audience with talent and charisma. Every true Diamond fan should have this video, (along with the CD) in their collection.",1013817600,8,283,5.173913043478261
7824292,5,6302320690,"If ever there was a ""truly great"" live concert video, it is this one. You will NEVER see Neil perform like this again.  I love this concert filmed in Los Angeles at the Greek Theatre, a 1976 landmark performance.  The songs are so true to the original melody and the romantic, sensuous ballads, ""Play Me"" and  ""I Am I Said"" are mesmerizing.

Neil has fun with the audience for ""Song Sung Blue"", he calls to the stage, none other that ""Fonzie"" from Happy Days and singer Helen Reddy.  Neil points out to other celebs in the audience.

How wonderful the music is from ""Beautiful Noise"" and ""Lady Oh"" and ""Street Life"" inspired from his Tin Pan Alley days. This is superb.  Wow, the ""Holly Holy"" and ""Brother Loves Traveling Salvation Show"" are rousing and riveting!  Neil is beautiful! His voice is captivating, deep and unique.

Enjoy the hits ""Cherry Cherry"", ""Sweet Caroline"", ""I've Been This Way Before"" and ""If You Know What I Mean"".  ....Rizzo",1009238400,26,947,4.684848484848485
