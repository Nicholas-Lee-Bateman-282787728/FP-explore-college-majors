8453318,5,B0051USHAY,"My daughter and I enjoyed the first season of MI-5/SPOOKS by renting the DVDs from Netflix in the early months of 2013.  When that became too slow a process, we purchased a nine season ""bargain"" boxed set for Region 1 from an internet site .  The set was a Chinese import and had discs enclosed in connecting cloth slip covers. By the time we needed Season 10, it was readily available at a reasonable price locally.  Susie and I shared many a dreary winter day watching MI-5.  The viewing took nearly three months of weekends to view the 86 episodes of ten seasons, and we were excited and eager to watch every episode.

  SPOOKS (known as MI-5 in the USA) is a British television drama series of ten seasons that originally aired on BBC from May 2002 to October 2011.  The series follows the day-to-day work of a group of MI-5 officers based at the service's Thames House headquarters in London, England.  It is notable for both its high production value and its use of popular guests. Iconic London landmarks including exterior shots of Thames House, the real headquarters of MI-5, the London Underground and London Bridge were used as locations.  Some filming was done at The Old Royal Naval College of Greenwich.

  The guest stars are primarily officers of MI-5 and include the better known British actors of the times.  Only the headquarters research and technical staff appears in most of the seasons. (Peter Firth plays Sir Harry Peace, Head of MI-5's Counter-Terrorism Department; he is in all ten seasons).  The series is known for its casual and indiscriminate disposal of characters.  Here today, gone tomorrow - in various and sundry ways.

  Mi-5 was nominated seven times for Best Drama Series of the year by BAFTA, the British Academy of Films and Television Awards, winning twice. Rupert Penry- Jones and Hermione Norris, my favorite duo of officers, won the British Crime Thriller Award in 2008 for Best Actor and Best Actress.  Other now well-known actors that appeared in the series include Matthew Macfadyen, Keeley Hawes, Miranda Raison, Gemma Jones and Richard Armitage.  David Oyelowo, who was Junior Case Officer Danny Hunter in the first three seasons, was recently nominated for a 2014 Golden Globe for portraying Martin Luther King, Jr.in the film ""Selma.""

The perfect Valentine present:  A box set of MI-5/SPOOKS to binge on!",1423526400,5,2356,4.893939393939394

8453320,5,B0051USHAY,"Excellent TV series!

Actually I am a super 24 TV series fan. What I must say is, Spooks TV series is 10 times better than 24, not only in terms of the story itself, but most importantly I can say is that all the scripts in each episode are nicely written, which can give you some surprise for each episode.

For every crime & action filmaholic, I think Spooks should be a MUST see TV series.",1323302400,14,392,4.144736842105263
