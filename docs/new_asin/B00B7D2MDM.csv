8563588,5,B00B7D2MDM,"The most important part of any martial system are in it's basics. Any house not built on solid foundation, is just one storm away from sinking,and  falling. These 3 dvd's are fundamental and foundational to understanding Southern Mantis. VERY IMPORTANT!  I think  Sifu RDH does an excellent job in establishing that fact and his guidance on establishing a solid foundation so the rest of the house is strong.",1459036800,,408,4.970588235294118
8563589,5,B00B7D2MDM,"Basics are the skills which trained over a long time and worked on with great thought and research turn into advanced skills.

All of Shifu Hagood's DVDs show the basics in detail.

No one can teach you.  You have to be able to teach yourself.",1446076800,2,243,4.355555555555555
8563590,5,B00B7D2MDM,This in my oppion is good. Sure the graphics are out dated but there isn't a whole lot of school in mantis kung fu that offer corspondence classes! As for the lessons themself its very detailed. Good job.,1426291200,2,204,4.394736842105263
