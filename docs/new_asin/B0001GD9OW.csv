1998148,5,B0001GD9OW,"I started taking a belly dance class and wasn't getting it, so I went to Shira's website and she spoke well of the DVD and i bought it. Two hours after dancing with Neon in the privacy of my home I had the gist of it. I have already told my husband that I want the second tape for Christmas. Neon is an excellent teacher and the geometrics showing how deep the curves need to be helped me understand the ""inner mechanics"" that we often can't see with our flowing costumery.",1101081600,16,473,4.208791208791209
1998149,5,B0001GD9OW,"The instruction on this video is top notch! The instructor, Neon, has chosen a set of bellydance movements that all have a foundation in circular movement. The order in which she teaches them builds one movement upon the last. It is much easier to learn the movements when they all have the same foundation instead of bouncing around from one type of movement to the next. This helps to cut down the learning curve and make your proficiency more `instant.' This also allows Neon to pack many, many more dance moves into her video. You will find a large amount of instruction and value for your money.

The production value is great! Neon is set against a black background which makes it very easy to see her movements. Neon's instruction is very clear. Although English is not Neon's first language, she's of Russian origin, she is extraordinarily articulate and elegant in her speech. She's one of the few instructors who does not require a voice over. One should have no problem understanding her clear and concise instruction.

One of the hallmarks of the two videos in her series (this one and the ""Instant Belly Dancer: Hipwork Plus"" video) are the geometric overlays used to help explain the movements. The computerized geometric overlays are placed directly on Neon's body during instruction to help the viewer better see the angle and direction of each movement. These same overlays are also used on a figure in the background as a constant reference point. It cannot be stressed how helpful these overlays are in bellydance instruction. These overlays are very useful to explain the difference between movements that may look similar to the beginner but are actually done with different muscles in the body and are foundations for more intricate moves later. What a fantastic idea! Bravo Neon!

Most of the instruction either shows Neon`s whole body, or body from the hips up so you can easily see how everything integrates. Close-ups are used to show specific areas of isolation but then return quickly to full length shots to complete the picture. Sometimes the close-ups are inset the full length shot so you can see more than one view simultaneously. One of the biggest faults of many bellydance videos is that they show close-ups when the viewer would need a full length shot and vice versa leaving the viewer very frustrated. This video seems to have the balance down correctly which is a very pleasant surprise.

I recommend going to the ""Extras"" section first and playing ""start here,"" ""elements of the method,"" and ""it is a dance of mind"" first before beginning the instruction. You will find it very helpful to review these sections both before and after the instruction section of the DVD. Watching them first will help you see what kinds of things to take note of during the instruction and viewing them again afterwards will help you be able to put the principles into practice. The ""Start Here"" section gives important tips for learning and dancing and introduces Neon's nemonic principle of instruction. ""Elements of the method"" explains four important principles -layering, change of levels, change of orientation, and travel - that apply to most dance steps and that help you vary the look of any dance movement and make it more interesting. ""It is a dance of mind"" gives examples of how the bellydance moves can be used in a nightclub setting and shows how the four elemets are integrated to create the whole. Watching this section will also get you excited about your upcoming instruction as you see the dance take over the dancer's whole bodies.

Neon is dressed in a bellydance top, `nightclub' pants, and heels. Her outfit makes it very easy to see the movement of her body while she is teaching. The outfit is a little closer to what you might wear yourself in a nightclub rather than if you were a performer. It is important to note that the style of bellydance she teaches here is what one could easily do while dancing in a nightclub. It's an easy, sensual, and feminine way to spice up your dancing when going out.

One note, I almost didn't buy either of these videos when I saw the covers, which would have been a shame because they turned out to be so fantastic. Neon wears a lot of makeup and is in the category my husband would call `too much!"" She would rival some of the locally famous drag queens in my home town! Although all performers wear lots of makeup while performing, don't let the unnecessarily giant quantity this beautiful woman wears be a detraction for you. It is apparently very normal for some Russian women to wear this much makeup, I'm told, and if this is the only thing `wrong' with the videos, as far as I can tell, then you have a fantastic set on your hands!",1091664000,62,4724,4.740875912408759
1998150,4,B0001GD9OW,"This DVD is perfect for its target audience. This is a wonderful video for a non-belly dancer who just wants to add some belly dance flavor to their dance floor moves. The DVD is professionally done and well laid out. I especially liked the diagram overlays. I wish the overlays were used more in other dance instructional videos. The video is almost worth having for those alone.
The only suggestion is that the special features section of the video should be watched first.
Please note *this is NOT a video for belly dancers or student of belly dance *. This video teaches moves differently than Neon teaches in her regular instruction. However, this video was not created for belly dancers; it was created specifically for people who are not interested in investing years to learn the dance. It is created for someone who wants to learn some basics to spice up their social dancing.
Summary: Perfect for people who want to add a belly dance look to dance floor moves..... which is exactly who she is marketing to.
People that are serious about the art of belly dancing should not judge this video harshly because she is not teaching ""real"" belly dance. She is teaching the lay-person the concepts of belly dance.
Hopefully having fun with her instructional DVD will spark an interest in belly dance that will lead you to taking classes and learning the full version of the dance.",1086220800,56,1382,4.738589211618257
1998151,5,B0001GD9OW,"Oh my goodness. This girl is a princess! Ive never seen anyone who has such grace about them, in the way they move, or even if they just stand still. I am new to bellydancing and so far this is the best resource I have. Its like a dictionary, you can try a lot of moves, at one glance you see the whole system (half the system actually since there is another DVD coming, I understand) Explanations are very detailed. I had no clue there is so much to all these moves. There is no way I will dance for real by Friday night, but I see why they call it instant.  Because it gives you this instant picture of the whole, and you can pick and choose whatever you want to learn. There are many menus and there is a little individual icon for every move, as I said, its like a dictionary, really great. There is a little movie ""Its a dance of mind"", it says ""when I first saw a belly dancer I knew...I , too, would dance"". I felt that way too!",1077148800,16,935,4.026881720430108

8012143,2,B0001GD9OW,"In this DVD, Neon teaches more basic moves in a concise fashion, with the added bonus of a geometry lesson, however it would be more useful and less boring if she laced these moves together into a choreography or combinations.  I would have liked to see a performance on this DVD--Neon has a beautiful body and is a good dancer, if some of her arm positions are less than perfect.  The addition of a live drummer was nice, but the sound recording was a little wonky.  There is not much on here for anyone but an absolute beginner, and I think they would be bored by this vocabulary lesson, even if Neon's Dracula-like accent is fun to listen to.  I prefer some of her other DVDs.",1422748800,,679,4.365079365079365
8012144,4,B0001GD9OW,"This is more like a fast demonstration of certain belly dance moves than it is a crash course in belly dancing. There aren't enough repetitions for beginners. If you are truly a beginner, Neon's You Can Bellydance! is much more approachable because it moves at a reasonable pace and you even learn two fun routines. This DVD seems to be geared toward teaching some moves really fast. I suppose if you just wanted to quickly get a belly dance overview and pick up a few moves, this would work. But if you really want to have fun with belly dance, get some of Neon's other DVDs. She has quite a few out there that are much more in-depth, such as Sensual Goddess - Bellydance for Total Beginners. Learning belly dance can be a great way to get a low-impact workout.",1334707200,,762,4.45
8012145,1,B0001GD9OW,"This is one of the worst video's I've ever watched.  Though she does go over curves and some belly dances moves, her focus is on club dance and the club sceene. Her outfits are so tacky and cheesy. I hated this video and I hated the music. The DVD was a waste of time to watch (I was fast fowarding the whole time).  Don't waste your time, if you want to watch a belly dance crash course video,[...], it is so much better than this one.",1126224000,10,436,4.058139534883721
8012146,5,B0001GD9OW,"This DVD is possibly one of the best made Belly dancing DVDs that I have seen so far. After reading the credits I realized that the dancer is also the filmmaker. Highly innovative in her approach, she has broken down the tough to discern gyrations into simple motion graphics. A definite plus if you are a beginner. though not that important if you are a pro. The instructor is gorgeous and seems like a fun chick.

If you are a beginner who really insists on dancing retro, there are plenty of the traditional fare going around. Get this DVD if you want if you want to dazzle your friends on the dance floor with the shortest learning curve. Yes the moves are very sexy. Possibly a little too sexy for the traditional styles. I like it like that.",1118620800,10,747,4.413043478260869
8012147,3,B0001GD9OW,"...but, she does break down moves better than other DVDs I've seen.  The geometric patterns used to describe hip movement along with where your knee should be swinging/pointing as your hip moves round is quite helpful.

Even if I was looking for club moves, this probably wouldn't be the DVD for me.  The thing I don't like about this is video is the lack of practice and lack of ""doing it with you"" feeling you get in most exercise videos. It's like I am suppose to watch her, stop the video and pratice on my own.

Something about her comes across as very, very practiced more than sensual. Maybe I just like the more authentic, traditional feeling belly dance DVDs.  I use this DVD to supplement another belly dance DVD I have.",1111449600,8,730,4.5
8012148,5,B0001GD9OW,"Neon recently sent me a wack of dance DVDs, and the first one I watched was Instant Belly Dancer: A Crash Course in Bellydance, Vol. 1 - Curves.  I have to admit, I was a bit put off by the title.  Instant bellydancer?  Ha!  I get prospective students who expect to be professional dancers by the end of a six-week course, and that's just not going to happen.  I mean, would you expect to be a professional athlete after nine hours of training?  I hope not!

In any case, the DVD will not be churning out thousands of professional dancers, but it will be giving plenty of people a much better understanding of core movements than will many other videos.  The best thing about the instruction in this particular video is its use of simple computer graphics demarcating circular movements.

I've often used similar shapes to explain movements in my own classes, but with gestures drawn by my hand rather than with overlaid images.  This video makes me wish I could have similar special effects for my classes!  The graphics make it obvious where the pelvis/head/ribcage ought to be at any given time.

Another good thing about the video is the way Neon explains posture and movement.  In many tapes, certain safety elements are glossed over (e.g. the importance of not hyperextending your joints), but Neon makes note of these points which are particularly crucial to novices.

Although I disagree with Neon on certain nuances within the dance, I chalk that up to a difference of style.  She is a kooky woman, but in a very charismatic sort of way.  I found myself laughing at her earnest facial expressions and turns of phrase, but not in a negative way.  She looks like a really fun chick.  Heh...

I'd like to stress that this video is not aimed at students wishing to learn classical Middle Eastern dance.  Instead, it is geared more toward club dancers.  Some of the movements (like the bouncing hip circle with hip thrusts) look rather raunchy, and I can't imagine doing them on stage in bedlah.  Similarly, I wouldn't teach them in my classes.  However, I'm sure these movements are well-suited to the local nightclub/discotheque where a bit of raunch is all the style.

Although this doesn't look like a huge-budget feature, it does have excellent production values.  The sound is good.  It's easy to see what Neon is doing at any given time due to the high contrast between her and the black background.  Although she has a strong Russian accent, she is easy to understand, and her phrasing is articulate and concise.

As far as I can tell, this is the strongest of Neon's videos.  If you're planning on getting any (and this is an excellent bargain), this is a good place to start.",1106438400,19,2689,4.673773987206823
8012149,4,B0001GD9OW,"The instruction was very good but I just could not get into the music it almost felt like a strip club dvd, yes shes a very good dancer but maybe I like the real belly dancing music more it just seems more natural.",1104537600,2,214,4.0
8012150,5,B0001GD9OW,"After taking a bellydance class by Kaeshi (who does the ""Bellyqueen: Bellydance Jam"" dvd), I thought I'd get this as a supplement for in-between the weekly classes. I'm glad I did. I also got her second dvd Hipwork Plus, which is just as good.

This dvd will hold your hand while you learn each of the authentic bellydance movements. She then shows how to put each of the different moves together and how it all works fluidly and gracefully.

However--this *is* ""instant""..........you can easily practice all the different moves w/o the dvd and just do them while watching tv or something. But, as w/most dance forms, your ""achievement"" comes from practice practice practice. Not from playing a tape or dvd.

Yes, there's the graphics besides Neon to help show what's going on w/each move (as described by the other reviewers here), but even w/o the graphics (which I mostly ignored anyway), Neon is excellent in explicitly describing each move. She's a lovely teacher who is easy to follow--perfect for beginners who've *never* done bellydancing, or those who may have learned *incorrectly* at first!",1103673600,18,1101,5.005464480874317
8012151,2,B0001GD9OW,"While others have given the DVD a good review, I must say that I was rather disappointed in it.  While the instruction techniques were sufficient, the instructor herself appeared to be more of an actor than a trained dancer.  Also, the music, instead of being turkish or egyptian, was more 'techno', which definitely didn't seem to compliment Belly Dancing techniques.

Overall, I gave this a 2-star review.  It's adequate, but note that it does not follow what many people may consider for ""traditional"" bellydancing.",1102982400,7,518,5.130952380952381
