3746836,4,B001PBKPPI,I have never seen anything like this so I have no way to compare it other than to itself.  A very interesting story.,1287446400,,116,4.043478260869565
3746837,4,B001PBKPPI,"Though not as well-known stateside as 'Sex and Zen', and in spite of starting off just like it, 'Sex and Chopsticks' has many gorgeous women, not just one, and great sets and costuming as well, making the asinine comedy less painful to sit through , and the sex scenes are far better and more frequent. We're even treated to a 'Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon' sex scene with one of the more voluptuous women I've seen in an Asian flick, and all of the other sex scenarios aren't laden with the silliness that permeates 'Sex and Zen'. So it rates higher on my sexploitation meter than 'Sex and Zen', though I did enjoy that as well (read my review for details). So much so, in fact, that as soon as I finished it, I jumped online and ordered 'Sex and Chopsticks II', as it's a continuation of the same tale with the same actors and (more importantly) the same actresses. It's a salacious sashimi platter for all who enjoy the genre. Check it.",1287100800,17,938,4.459302325581396
3746838,4,B001PBKPPI,"Great actors, very hot actresses and the story is good, you won't get bored watching it again and again.  Can't wait for Part 2 - not sure if it already came out yet.",1243036800,9,166,4.03030303030303
3746839,4,B001PBKPPI,"In the tradition of Chinese cinema's costume sexploitation flicks ""Sex and Zen"" and ""Chinese Torture Chamber"" comes an adaptation of a classical 17th century novel called ""Jin Pang Mei"" (aka. The Plum in the Golden Vase) which is a significant piece of Chinese literature alongside ""The Romance of Three Kingdoms"". Nope, I am not about to compare this film to the John Woo film, ""Red Cliff""--I am just stating its historical literary relevance and that 2008 is a return to classics in Hong Kong cinema. ""The Forbidden Legend: Sex and Chopsticks"" is a solid entry in the genre of Chinese costume sexploitation and knows exactly what its target audience is. This film isn't your usual sleazy skin film, directed by Chin Man Kei (Sex and Zen 2), this is a wannabe artsy stuff.

Sung Dynasty period. Simon Qing (Lam Wai Kin) is the son of a famed sexologist named Simon Tate (Chui Siu Keung). Upon reaching adulthood, he becomes a handsome, good for nothing womanizer and well endowed. Qing knew about the drugs and techniques that can maximize carnal pleasures. Once he reached the proper age, his father hired a voluptuous harlot, Violetta (curvaceous Kaera Uehara) to teach him the act of lovemaking. Henceforth, Simon embarked upon a life of womanizing. Upon his travels, he meets a virgin nun named Moon (sexy Hikaru Wakana) when Qing was stricken with fever and sought shelter in Moon's nunnery. There, Moon's curiosity was awakened and she was seduced by Qing to abandon her post and be taken home to become his wife. However, after his father passed on, Qing could not be satisfied with one woman. He often has sex with the prettiest women in the region and earned himself a reputation as a playboy. He has sex with the head of a brothel (played by Yui Morikawa) and encounters a young slave girl named Lotus which aroused his curiosity because of her small feet. Years passed, Qing encounters Lotus again (this time played by arousing Serina Hayakawa), she is now a young woman who had reached sexual maturity and much to his dismay, Lotus is married to a repulsive dwarf named Wu Da-Lang (Ng Chi Hung). Qing becomes obsessed with Lotus and plans to have her by hook or by crook..

""Sex and Chopsticks"" is a softcore flick full of gratuitous and vigorous sex scenes that even includes some girl on girl action, REAL full frontal female nudity and comedic sequences. It doesn't match up with ""Sex and Zen"" or ""Chinese Torture Chamber"" when it comes to artistic quality but it does stand on its own as a flick full of silly dirty humor, martial arts action and decent production values. The film starts out as a comedic ""sexual awakening"" for our young Simon Qing, as he father teaches him to master his body and mind. Qing masters the techniques of doing push-ups and writing with his male member as well incorporating the mental disciplines of the ""Tao of Sex"". It was quite intriguing as Qing becomes ""oversexed"" and he would treat himself in almost every way possible, much of it is exaggerated and meant to amuse the viewer and none of the scenes are offensive. Then once you see Violetta who is played by luscious Japanese AV- actress Kaera Uehara, you will feel a very strong titillating sensation when you see all the full frontal nudity and the film goes into silly comedic overdrive.

I found it quite curious that all the women are played by Japanese AV-idols such as Kaera Uehara, Yui Morikawa, Hikaru Wakana, and Serina Hayakawa in a Hong Kong production. I suppose all the bad publicity that a skin flick would generate was avoided by Chinese actresses but hey, I think this was a blessing in disguise. Without these voluptuously sexy Japanese women, I doubt we would see a lot of full frontal nudity. I also found it quite amusing that aside from Moon, the nunnery's women were all played by young boys and the headmaster is played by an old man. I hardly saw any Chinese actresses except maybe for the occasional passer-bys and Madame Wang who served as Qing's godmother. Also, Yui Morikawa plays dual roles as Qing's mother and a brothel Madame--which is so weird but I suppose this was meant as a very subtle commentary?

The sex scenes are long and very erotic, and rivals the titillation factor of Japanese ""Pink films"". Lam Wai Kin is a veteran in these types of films and he really looked like he was having a ball with his role. Unlike Chiu Siu Keung (who looked liked he didn't want to touch Morikawa in his only sex scene), Lam Wai Kin looked very comfortable with all the nudity and fornications; and the women really looked like they were really getting into the simulated sex scenes and facial expressions genuinely reflected enjoyment. Familiar prosthetics and tools were used in this flick that I am sure will be recognized. Wires were used in some of the sex scenes as a form of enhancements, dancing and even ""combat by sex"". These elements will definitely be appreciated by fans of ""Sex and Zen"".  Hey, the film even serves up some sequences of decently choreographed martial arts action.

""The Forbidden Legend: Sex and Chopsticks"" isn't a very good movie if you look at it from an artistic standpoint. But if you look at it as a silly caricature of an oversexed playboy, it is a lot of fun to watch and it never gets boring. I found myself snickering quite a number of times with some of silly exaggerated sex scenes. I was a little surprised that the film went for a different tone in the last act and became a disquieting commentary about one's obsession; it lost it's sense of humor and became a commentary on licentious and immoral behavior. I guess Qing's lack of morals were meant to give it some touches of drama but such an approach felt inappropriate here.

Despite its downright silliness, a weak plot and some major flaws in direction (one isn't here to watch it for brilliance), ""Sex and Chopsticks"" does what it meant to do. It serves up a lot of comedy, dirty humor, and is a great excuse to bring an overabundance of full frontal nudity and very vigorous sex scenes. The film is not to be taken seriously and meant purely for guilty pleasure. Fans of ""Hanzo the Razor"", ""Chinese Torture Chamber"" and ""Sex and Zen"" should definitely give this one a watch. The film is a HOOT but it needed more chopsticks!

8332950,4,B001PBKPPI,"There is actually a plot for this movie, and the actors do try to make the flow seem reasonable in context. Sex scenes seem abit over-acted though.",1293494400,,147,4.481481481481482
8332951,4,B001PBKPPI,"This sequel begins where the first one left off, and if you haven't seen the first it won't make much difference seeing as there's a recap (these flicks aren't deep in the first place; it's not like we're attracted to them 'cause of plot intricacies or elaborate productions and special effects) before we get right down to business.

The first sex scene occurs moments after the title credits roll, and it's a silly scene like several in the first installment, nonetheless erotic, but from there, the story and sexual scenarios turn a bit darker and more perverse, much to our delight. Simon, our protagonist from the first film, has allowed his carnal conquests and libidinous gluttony get the better of him, and now has four concubines AND a wife, yet still isn't satisfied. Insatiability is the issue explored here as he conspires to eliminate his friends in order to add their wives/widows to his harem, occasionally allowing these men to have access to his stable of consorts in order to worm his way into theirs. Yup, he's an arrogant weasel who believes no one's onto his antics, but soon enough, his own jealous concubines begin to conspire first against one another to advance their agendas, and then against him, setting off a chain of events that bring about the ruination of all the relationships that were thriving when the first film ended and this one began. ""Lust is the Sword of Damocles"", the relevant phrase used by the concubine who brings an end to Simon's reign in the cautionary finale, a blood-drenched retaliation for his unbridled lust and ego.

As far as the important issues go, the four women leads are all a marvel to behold, the sets and costuming lavish for a sexploitation flick, and sex scenes are frequent, full-frontal, well-shot, multi-angled and prolific. As a companion piece to the first film, which I heartily recommend (read my review), it's a keeper - a rich menu of carnal Cantonese cuisine with a hefty side of wasabi mustard to keep things hot and spicy. Don't forget your chopsticks...",1292371200,,2033,4.839080459770115
