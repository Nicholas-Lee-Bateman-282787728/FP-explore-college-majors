7986895,5,B00008T7G7,"This is one of those forgotten films that truly needs put on dvd. James Brolin plays an ex-cop who is raising his daughter by himself and is barely getting by. His daughter goes to school one day and is mistaken for the daughter of a wealthy family and is kidnapped by a psycho for ransom. Brolin does an excellent job portraying the distraught father who does everything in his power to find his daughter. Great chase scenes! You can really feel his despair as he searches for her through about all areas of the city (New York I believe)including the red light district, the projects, the subway...! Truly an outstanding film that will keep your interest through til the end!",1143676800,22,676,4.641666666666667
