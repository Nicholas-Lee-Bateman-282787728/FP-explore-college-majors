659316,5,6303471277,"I do find myself finding Charlton Heston attractive, even in his later days of lively living..... Charlton Heston Presents the Bible has got to be his most memorial memory of the Charlton Heston line.....  If there's only 2 in stock then I erge you to INSTANTLY make a coffee and order it! I've sat there many of a time watching this masterpeice with a tear in my left eye.",1103068800,4,373,4.405797101449275
659317,5,6303471277,"These are masterful Bible readings, spoken with conviction and passion, and framed by the history that surrounded the time of Jesus, and the archeological sites that are appropriate to the Biblical passages read. Filmed in Israel, the photography is marvelous, and also included are beautiful art pieces of Jesus in the different phases of His life and ministry.

 Charlton Heston's resonant voice uses the King James Bible for the text, and his actor's skills to speak the many parts; this film is inspiring either to watch, or to listen to. I often put it on as I work, and find it calming yet energizing, and full of God's spirit.

 It also explains many points with clarity, for instance the specific purpose of the money-changers, and why Jesus was angered with them, which I never fully understood before.

 There is something very powerful in the way this is presented, and reminds one that the origins of scripture were orally transmitted in these majestic hills and stones where Heston walks, and on the shores of the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee.

 Photographed and directed by Tony Westman, and with music by Leonard Rosenman, one of the Executive Producers is Fraser Heston, Charlton's son, who directed the terrific 1989 production of Treasure Island, starring his father as Long John Silver. Total running time 49 minutes.",1090627200,2,1337,4.9641255605381165
659318,5,6303471277,"This is some of Charlton Heston's finest work. Mr. Heston's premise is that before the Bible was written down it was told orally in the way of a story and passed down from generation to generation until Moses started to write the first five books down. He recreates this style of story telling. He and his son Fraser show how the Bible has influenced the arts.
He also, contrary to the other review, dramatizes the Bible stories as a one man performance in an old Roman ampitheatre in Jerusalem. In between he takes you around and shows some of Israel's greatest Judeo-Christian monuments. He traces the history of the Bible and how it came to be all the way up to the King James version of 1611. This is the 3rd in the series and if you would like to see everything from The Creation through the Life of Christ I highly recommend this thought provoking and entertaining series. Each DVD has a behind the scenes segment included, but it is the same behind the scenes on each DVD.",1060128000,10,979,4.4748603351955305
659319,5,6303471277,"Charlton Heston really does a superb job in this wonderful presentation.
A great actor (and American) with great material!
What more can one ask?",1051574400,3,145,5.083333333333333
659320,1,6303471277,"I purchased this video as a Christmas gift in the hopes that it would describe the life of Jesus Christ while simultaneously showing the places in the Holy Land where events occured.  The video is nothing more than Charlton Heston standing in an old Roman ampitheatre literally reading the Bible.  Majority of the film shows him standing at a podium and simply speaking to the camera!  There are very, very short ""clips"" of him driving a jeep up the ""Mount of the Beatitudes"", or standing in the Jordan River, or on a fishing boat in the Sea of Galilee; but these glimpses of places from the life of Jesus are very brief.
I will not be purchasing any more of ""The Bible"" series videos, strictly based upon what I saw in this video; I was very disappointed, and the recipient of the gift was also very disappointed.  My suggestion, save your money and read the Bible!",977875200,14,866,4.532051282051282

659444,3,6303471277,"This film was ok as far as it went, however it was not what I was looking for.  This is a sermon by Charlton Heston telling the story of Jesus of Nazareth.  That is fine as long as it is what you are looking for.  There was movie that came out a few years ago called ""Jesus of Nazareth"" which was a dramatization with actual actors playing the parts.  I saw a few scenes of it during a Lenten mission at my church.  It was very moving and was looking to see the whole movie.",1361836800,,474,3.9473684210526314

659446,5,6303471277,charlton Heston enhanced dramatically the spirit of the Lords land. The quality of the video was excellent. Historically to the point and followed the bible scripture for scripture.,1350777600,,181,5.5
659447,2,6303471277,"First off, I'm a devout Christian, and I appreciate a good movie about Christ when I can find it.  I guess I was just under the impression from reading the DVD case that Heston, who was in Israel for the filming of this movie, would bring to life many of the scenes of Jesus' life by talking about them at the actual place it happened.

Rather, he mostly just appears in some drab ancient temple ruins quoting long passages of scripture for most of the movie, while you see ancient artwork to highlight specific events.

Yes, at times you'll see him wading in the Jordan River, and fishing on the Sea of Galilee, however these scenes are very short (around 30 seconds), then it's right back to the drab ruins for some more scripture reading.

I was really bored, and ended up fast-forwarding the movie looking for the scene to change, because I was so interested to actually see the Holy Land.  Sadly, with so few on-site scenes, there was little to keep my interest.  Also, Heston was reading from the King James Version, so it sounded more like a Shakespeare performance than the Bible to me!",1234137600,3,1094,4.527918781725888
659448,5,6303471277,Of course it's only appropriate to have such a well-known actor do this series.  And it doesn't hurt that he has a great speaking voice that is instantly recognizable.  Who can NOT listen to Moses?,1207440000,,197,4.6

7848091,4,6303471277,"As a long-time fan of Charlton Heston's work, I found it fascinating to see him here not exactly acting -- there are no sets or costumes --but rather speaking the words of the Bible.  His talent is evident, because scripture that I have heard all my life is given a freshness of meaning by Mr. Heston's inimitable phrasing and emphasis on key points.  He does to scripture what Sinatra did to song lyrics. While he remains true to the Biblical language, he makes it sound personal and conversational -- as if he had lived the events and is now telling you about his experiences.  He walks among the actual sites, and you get the feeling of a good old friend taking you on a tour of the Holy Land, reminiscing about what he saw and heard there.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that it isn't entertaining in the usual sense -- but if you are a believer, you will be hanging on to Mr. Heston's every word, just as I was.",1454716800,,927,4.25
