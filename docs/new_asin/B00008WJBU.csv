1865072,4,B00008WJBU,"The premise of this film is that some people can steal luck from others. The idea is bizarre but interesting, and the director (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo) and some great actors managed to make a great movie out of it.

The main character, Thomas (Leonardo Sbaraglia), the only survivor of a tragic crash that killed the other 236 passagers in the plane, is one of the ""fortunate"" people that can steal luck. He is not so fortunate, though, because he is arrested by the police while he is in a hospital recovering from the crash, due to the fact that he is a thief. Despite that, not all is lost for him.

A strange man called Federico (Eusebio Poncela) helps him to escape, on the condition that Thomas will bet for him in a secret and very exclusive ring of betting, and that they will split the earnings. As a consequence, Thomas is introduced to to a secret society of ""fortunate"" people addicted to betting all kind of things in different games. The stakes are high: money, houses, people... The questionn is: how far is Thomas ready to go?.

On the whole, I can say that I highly enjoyed this movie, and that I recommend it to you. I have never seen a plot similar to this one. Whether that means that I don't watch enough movies, or that is an extremely original film, I don't know. All the same, watch it: you have nothing to lose, and a lot to gain  :)

1865073,5,B00008WJBU,"What a film.  I have to be honest, I'd never heard of this before, but I am so glad I took a chance with it.

Its quite a difficult film plot to describe: but in a nut shell its about a dangerous game played with people who have proved to be 'extremely' lucky (perhaps supernaturally so).  The games become more and more dangerous, and are always played blindfolded (my favourite was running through a forest hand ties behind backs - the last NOT to run into a tree is the winner).  There is a reason for this (which I won't disclose) and this is genuinely and exciting a quite unique movie.

All the actors are excellent (especially Max von Sydow and the gorgeous Leonardo Sbaraglia from Burnt Money).

A thrilling and inventive movie.

They do, however, have many unique ways of gambling and finding out what kind of luck you have. I especially enjoyed the part where a prospective lucky man blindfolds himself and runs across a busy freeway at night to prove himself.

A few of the characters don't seem very believable. That is, the actors don't seem to relate to the characters they are playing. A few of the roles seemed rather hollow to me.

The action only ceased for a few dramatic pauses, and the ending was unique. I would share this one with all my friends.

1865075,3,B00008WJBU,"I didn't know what to expect at first watching Intacto. A movie about people stealing each others' luck would ordinarily sound ridiculous, but despite skating the edge of credibility, Intacto has a lot of style and some scenes of quiet suspense. I am also a huge fan of Max Von Sydow, and he is clearly a standout in this movie as the Jew, a man who is able to convey his uncanny ability to survive deadly games as almost a tragedy. His conversation with the main character Tomas (also very good) is  quite touching. It seems that even though many of the characters in the movie have incredible luck, the luck in the end seems to be more of a curse than a blessing as characters throughout the movie are unable to get enjoyment from their ""good fortune.""",1075852800,6,754,4.463768115942029
1865076,5,B00008WJBU,"Some people believe that a certain kind of thing can bring a good luck to them.  Clover with four leaves, black cat (in England), and Japanese beckoning cat.  Then, what if a luck happens to be something you can steal, collect, and use?  And use to kill?
""Intacto"" is a bizarre, unnerving, and quite original thriller from young Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo.  Its story is complicated, but is not hard to follow.  One crimial Thomas (Sbaraglia), the only surviver of a terrible plane crash, meets a strange guy Federico in the hospital.  Federico asks Thomas to draw a card just casually.  Little did Thomas know that it is only the beginning of games that test his own luck ... the game that becomes more and more deadly as it goes on.
As Federico and Thomas travel together, they unwittingly involve some other 'lucky' characters; Sara, female police investigator who seems to be unaware of her own luck; Arejandro, a bull fighter who somehow got never hurt; and Sam, the owner of a casino (excellent Max von Sidow), who survived one of the tragic events known in the world's history.
This is Fresnadillo's feature debut (though his short ""Esosados"" has been nominated for Oscar in 1996), and like another talented Spanish director of ""Open Your Eyes,"" he has his own style.  The picture always exudes some eerie atomosphere (like David Lynch), and though his narrative gets slightly confusing (especially the conclusion), he carries this unusual material to the end quiet gracefully.
There are many ""games"" that test the characters' lucks, which might look, to be frank, somewhat silly to some of us.  Certainly few of us would dare to do these things, risking their limbs and life, but the director has enough visual skills to convince us that there must be some people who try to run THERE, blindfolded.
My material says that the director actually witnessed the plane accident in the Canary Island when he has a child, and that experience is part of inspiration of the film.  Also, he has read the books of Primo Levi (""Survival in Auschwitz""), whose background helped to develop the concept.  The film at first sight looks too incredible, but close inspection reveals that it contains thought-provoking things like the guilty feeling which some survivers of terrible accidents have.
But of course, you can enjoy it as entertainment, and as such ""Intacto"" is just great.  And the images are very beautiful, such as the bleak landscape of the Canary Island (where the casino is set).
Hollywood (Buena Bista, at the time of writing) has already bought the right of remake, and that fact testifies that the film is very original.  If you like the kind of films like ""Thesis"" or ""Open Your Eyes,"" you should not miss this thriller.",1068422400,14,2744,4.8626609442060085
1865077,5,B00008WJBU,"My one complaint, which I'll state at the very start, is that the English subtitles remain even when the characters are speaking in English. It's very annoying. English subtitles when they're speaking Spanish (which is most of the film) makes sense... English subtitles when they're speaking English is just plain distracting.
Having gotten that out of the way...
I don't want to reveal too much of the story because half the fun is watching things gradually unfold, but I will say that this film has a very original premise, having to do with the nature of luck. The idea is that luck is an actual ""thing"" that can be traded, stolen, and gambled away.
Our central character is a thief who, it turns out, has the gift of luck and so is pulled into this strange world of people who collect luck. Many of these people are quite ruthless, and as the stakes gradually increase, our protagonist stands to lose far more than his knack for good luck.
The tone of this film is very creepy and clever... in many ways, it reminded me of ""Blood Simple,"" ""Memento,"" ""Music of Chance,"" or Atom Egoyan's ""Exotica."" Like all four of those movies, there's a lot to absorb and it's handed to you in small pieces. This is a movie that requires your full concentration. Fortunately, that's not hard to give, as the film itself is absolutely fascinating and full of brilliant images and moments.

1865078,3,B00008WJBU,I saw the preview and really wanted to see this movie. First of all I thought it was in English...it wasnt. This isn't bad the preview makes you think it'll be in English.

1865079,4,B00008WJBU,"""Intacto"" is a rather clever film.  This film is also very confusing, which makes it hard to come up with a premise without giving much away.  But here goes.  ""Intacto"" is a film essentially luck.  In the film, games are played, think of it as ""gambling"", and prizes are won.  However, these are not ordinary prizes.  The prizes are people's luck.  This sounds a little off, but it's true.  The people in the film believe that after playing these games, gathering a picture of someone gives you their luck.  No, I'm not joking.
There has been a plane crash, and Tomas is the only survivor.  A man named Federico thinks this is odd, and immediately comes running to see Tomas.  Five years earlier, Federico had his luck taken completely away by The Jew, a holocaust survivor, whom is supossedly the luckiest man alive.  Having lost all of his luck, Federico convinces Tomas to go with him and play ""games"", or whatever the heck they call it.
I may sound like I'm making fun of the movie, but I'm really not.  This is a very beautiful film, that is beautifully shot, and brilliantly acted.  The film is just so odd.  It's a very original work, and I have to admit, this is a very good film.
The only problem is that it's about 45 minutes into the movie before we really think we know what's going on.  In fact, in the beggining the Jew and Federico are talking, but we really don't know what they're talking about, so therefore later when we realize what they were talking about, we forgot all of what they said.
And the games are so bizarre.  My favorite is when they put blindfolds around themselves.  Then, they start at the beggining of a forest of trees.  They then take off through the forrest blindfolded, with many chances of smacking right into a tree.  One by one, the gamblers are knocked flat on their back by trees they run at full speed into.  The last one standing wins.
""Intacto"" is definitly bizarre, and at times greatly confusing.  I've only seen the film once, and am anxious to see the film again, because this film cannot be solved by being seen once.  The problem with most films of this sort, is that you don't care what really happened.  However, this film makes an exception.",1056585600,,2199,4.494949494949495

So now Federico must find some luck and return for the showdown.  Can he do it? We see what he must go through with a new found down-on -his-luck lucky person.

You have to pay attention at all times to this movie as whatever looks  just incidental for ambience may just  actually be part of the clues for the future or the past however you look at it.

1865114,4,B00008WJBU,"This is a strange offbeat film that, like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City/dp/B0018O4YT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City</a>' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B002ZG980U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>', is a nudged parallel reality to our own existence. Everything familiar is strangely alien, a world and its people that are darkly askew and never seen straight on.

The film's premise is that Luck is a tangible energy, one that can be bartered, gambled, accrued, and even stolen from you. The vast majority of us have very little of it, so we live our lives in the monotone plain of obscurity.

However, a fortunate few have amounts that warrant note. And for those few - a different world beckons. It's a foreboding and terribly dangerous world, but with it comes the dangled dreams of luxury, pleasure and vibrancy. The adage that you never feel so alive as when you come close to death is the foundation upon which this world's reality is based.

The few with preordained prosperity are given the opportunity, very selectively, very underground and very illegally, the chance to improve and add to their fortunes via twisted forms of illegal gambling involving physical abuse and, ultimately, death. Again, personal luck is an energy, one you have but can lose. If it's wagered then your luck is placed into a type of 'vault'. Said vault takes the form of an old fear: A picture captures a part of your soul. These gamblers carry around stashes of polaroid images. Each image contains that person's luck, and if you win, you can move onto progressively more deadly contests. Successive wins garners you that much more fortune, and with that comes money, power, and dreams fufilled. Until you lose.

Into this bizarre diorama is Toms, played by captivating Spanish actor Leonardo Sbaraglia. A man who lives a barren life, one void of love and purpose. The reason? He was the sole survivor of an airline crash. The same crash which killed his wife and their only child. What's left is an empty tattered shell. But what he doesn't realize is that having gone through that horrific experience - his life is now filled with enormous luck; though you'd be hard pressed to convince him of that.

That terrible incident brings him to the attention of Federico, played by intriguing actor Eusebio Poncela, himself once one of the luckiest persons on the face of the planet. But he's nothing now, just a normal gray person - a nobody. But he still has a life goal: Take revenge on the man who took all his luck. That man is Samuel, played by quintessential actor Max Von Sydow, and he is the literal King Of Fortune. He's the luckiest man alive. Through his own life experience by surviving the Nazi concentration camps and losing his entire family, and over the subsequent decades, has amassed a frighteningly amount of the intangible. The massive vault he uses holds a staggering array of polaroids; all categorized and organized into a sick twisted library/catalog.

Federico needs an 'in' back to the games - and ultimately back to Samuel.

The pair form an uneasy bond, each with goals completely separate from the other, all the while furtively dodging arrest. The games are so illegal that it's now attracted the attention of the police. The authorities have picked up only hints and rumors of strange gambling all over the globe - and now one street cop has gotten closer than any other before her. She's hot on the trail of both Toms and Federico, convinced that she'll break the group's secrecy.

The fates of these characters eventually intersect at one dramatic moment - each having gone ""all in"" with their luck on the cosmic gaming table.

1865115,4,B00008WJBU,"This story was a bit different in the sense that it deals with gambling in a very creative (albeit deadly) way that I have never seen before. At first I was a bit lost but as the movie unfolds you catch on eventually. Tying a Holocaust survivor into the mix of main characters and which also served as the basis for the ultimate form of gambling was quite clever. The plot deals with luck and fortune, superstition and perhaps a touch of magic.

Although there are some scenes that are suggestively graphic (violence) there is a quality to this movie that helped me relax and did not over-excite me before bedtime. The cinematography is quite beautiful and the musical score were, for the most part, quite soothing which probably is why I felt so relaxed instead of jolted (as some movies can do). Just thought I would describe the feel of the film as it provided a different vibe and was a pleasant welcomed surprise.",1314057600,,918,4.5636363636363635
1865116,4,B00008WJBU,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the similarities between this movie and ""13 Tzameti"" are inescapable. Not only in the general outline concerning questions of fate/luck but in that there are some specific items, namely in a particular game played (albeit with some differences) in both movies, but also the reference to the number 13.

In this movie you have a small handful of people that have fallen on the lucky side (sometimes very lucky) of a given situation but usually at a cost. One (Max Von Sydow) is so lucky he can play a game of Russian Roulette once a year and know he will survive. He also lives in a casino and can direct one of his minions to take away the luck of someone (by merely touching them) who is winning too much in said casino. Some of the lucky people seek out others to play various games and make money. There is more but why spoil?

This is an odd one. The plot is very complex in the way the various people and their stories (or their part in the story) intertwine with each other. I didn't quite understand some of the more subtle aspects (one involving photographs) but a second viewing should take care of that. All the characters are interesting and it has a good steady look and feel to it. The writer/director had a solid handle on what he was trying to convey. I can't say there is any deep emotion necessitating  any gut-wrenching performances here but the actors all do a professional job. What I found very intriguing is that much of the plot involves people looking for, and recruiting, other people who are inherently lucky. As though it were something quantifiable as opposed to fleeting. The ending is good. Too often you get into a really good flick only to have them drop the ball on the one yard line. Not the case here. I found it very fitting.

This is a movie you have to wrap your head around. It won't come to you. You have to go to it. If you're into this sort of head trip, this should satisfy your cravings.",1313366400,,1966,4.422651933701657

1865131,4,B00008WJBU,"Intacto (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2001)

Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (28 Weeks Later...) began his feature film career with Intacto, an intriguing meditation on the nature of luck that wouldn't be out of place on your shelf beside El Laberinto del Fauno. While Fresnadillo stays tied much more rightly to the real world than Guillermo del Toro did in 2006's best film, the sense of wonder that pervades del Toro's masterpiece can be found here in equal amounts.

Fresnadillo's script, co-written with Andres Koppel, centers on Federico (Eusebio Poncela), who begins the film in the inner circle of the unnaturally lucky. He is employed as a cooler at a casino, but he works in a different way than most: by touching someone, he is capable of stealing that person's store of luck and adding it to his own. When he finds himself wanting to leave the job, he finds he's not allowed to leave with his stored luck; Samuel (Max von Sydow), the man behind all this, steals Federico's luck before allowing him to leave. Federico develops an obsession for finding others like him, training them, and overthrowing Samuel. To this end, he finds Tomas (Leonardo Sbaraglia), the lone survivor of a plane crash. Unfortunately, Tomas is a bank robber, so the law, in the form of Sara (Monica Lopez), is after him. Federico introduces Tomas to the world of ""fluid luck"", for lack of a better term, and the two of them, with Sara always in pursuit, get closer and closer to Federico's goal and the inevitable meeting with Samuel.

Despite the fact that this is a gritty, understated film-- it would not be outside the realm of validity to call it an urban fantasy-- Fresnadillo does not limit the scope of his vision to the concrete landscapes around him. This is a remarkably free-feeling film; I can't think of any other way to describe it. (This is depicted, specifically, in the casino, which is in a secluded place in the desert, well away from the rest of civilization.) The relentless realism with which it is filmed combines with the ludicrous premise to create a feeling that anything is possible, and that's what keeps the viewer riveted, even more so than the gloomy cinematography, the finely-tuned performances, or the truly original plot. An excellent piece of work all around. ****",1193875200,,2275,4.843187660668381

He runs a casino where luck is vital to the players and many often have 'high stakes' in some bizarre games played behind closed doors. For some, it appears they do have extraordinary 'luck', but can life's events really be that simple? I was very surprised by the ending and it prompted a long discussion between my husband and myself as to whether good luck actually exists for some and not others.

1865133,3,B00008WJBU,"The odd thing when you watch the opening scene of Intacto is a weird feeling of deja vu as you realize the opening scene of the Cooler appears to be stolen from Intacto which predates it by two years.  That said, I would agree with the more critical person who said that the logic of luck in the Cooler is a bit easier to follow that the concept of luck employed in Intacto. (The Cooler has its own problems, however.)

Possible spoiler alert. Like the Cooler, Intacto has a kind of feel-good message underneath it that love and emotion eventually have some impact on luck in the end, which doesn't quite work for me, honestly, especially not in this one. In order to get us there, the script connives to get the hero to wager unknowingly the luck of a woman he loves but that forced plot development seems simply to raise lots of questions about the mechanism of the bets and how a simple photograph carries with it anything about the person if that person has not agreed to surrender their luck (as seemed to be necessarily the case in another sequence); it confuses the issue of how exactly the luck obtaining process, which the film depicts but glosses over in the details, is supposed to really work. And it also just feels wrong in a movie of ideas like this one to imply so simplistically that true selfless love is supposed to bring good results (ergo the people who died in the camps instead of the Luckiest man in the world didn't love and so they didn't have luck?). Perhaps the filmmaker has a completely well thought out explanation of it all but it doesn't quite come across in the film and so it's hard to feel by the end of it any real satisfaction in the plot events.

Intacto does contain a number of very memorable and distinctive scenes of luck challenges or contests: the forest scene being probably the best of them. This is an odd film overall but it has a certain strange charm to it despite its pronounced failings, so I could see things to be gained from watching it if you're interested in the luck theme as I was.",1173571200,3,2041,4.422872340425532
1865134,4,B00008WJBU,"`Intacto', the Spanish language film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea seemingly borrowed from `The Deer Hunter', with a bit of subtle sci-fi theming worthy of Rod Serling's `The Twilight Zone'. The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all those spooky early Ingemar Bergman movies makes his character all that more credible.

The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the movie revolves around the characters' participation in highly dangerous, some even fatal games of chance, much like the Russian roulette theme from `The Deer Hunter'. While the attraction in `The Deer Hunter' is purely an addiction to the thrill of the risk, the attraction is both more subtle and stronger in `Intacto'.

I'm a big fan of the director's commentary on movies like this, but I found the commentary just a bit thin here. It did very little to explain the basic premise, it's development, or its origins.

The movie is not as deep or as emotionally involving as Bergman's `The Magician' or `The Virgin Spring' or Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. The characters are thrill seekers with little depth, but the subtly supernatural premise and the way the story is told makes the trip interesting.",1173398400,,1320,4.910313901345291
1865135,2,B00008WJBU,"A one-line summary of this movie makes it sound fascinating:  Proven lucky people (sole survivors of plane crashes and car accidents, for instance) compete in high-stakes, ultimately deadly ""Who's really the luckiest?"" competitions. It's a great concept, really, but it's told in a very confusing, poorly edited way so you never really quite understand what's goin on.  There's some references to people's luck being drained from them when one of the other luckies touches them, but this is never really explained satisfactorily. The characters' storylines are never really fleshed out to let us know who's who and what their relationships are to each other.  Still, there are some nice moments in the film...the scene of all the blindfolded luckies running full-speed through a dense forest until only one is left standing comes to mind. Sadly, the whole of the movie is far less satisfying than parts such as this.",1139011200,7,916,5.134228187919463
1865136,5,B00008WJBU,"Have you ever tried to test your luck? Just to see how lucky you are or, better say, how crazy your luck could be? Some people find it out a hard way.. Some through Nazi's concentration camps, some in ill-fortunate air flight, the possibilities are endless and versatile like the life itself. But this movie is not just about luck. It also explores the power of coincidence, the power of attraction, what and who people are ready to sacrifice for their love and what and who to betray for their power, for the power of being Invincible. It is the superb mystic thriller which will keep you on the edge of your seat from the begining to end. But when it is over please don't try to check your luck like they do in the movie, after all you are given only one chance.",1127692800,,764,4.3125
1865137,4,B00008WJBU,"Intacto is an interesting movie based on a very original and creative theme. It loosely based on the adage that states ""there is limited luck in this world, you always get somebody else's share"". The movie is about a bunch of people who are either full of luck or utterly luckless. The luckless hunt for the lucky ones, run wagers and attempt to get lucky themselves. The very idea of being able to collect luck is intriguing.

Samuel (Max von Sydow) is an old holocaust survivor who runs a high-end casino in the middle of nowhere. He has been extremely lucky all his life and plays a dangerous one bullet game. He hasn't lost in thirty years and all his challengers have died. Thomas Sanz (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is the lone survivor of a plane crash (and thus deemed lucky) who is approached by a luckless Federico (Eusebio Poncela) to run wagers. Federico  is deceitful and wants to steal some of Thomas's luck and Thomas wants to quickly multiply his aircraft-crash insurance compensation. Incidentally, Thomas had burgled a bank before the crash and a cop in the form of Sara (Monica Lopez) is in hot pursuit. Each character's life gets entwined while as they attempt to fulfill their motives. The story wavers and gets confusing at times, but that just adds to the  intriguing plot. Thomas eventually manages to run a wager with Samuel ... you'll have to watch the movie to know the winner.

Intacto is another good movie coming from Spain. Terrific performances by Leonardo Sbaraglia and Max von Sydow. The cinematography deserves high marks, it is successful in creating surreal landscapes. The wager games are very creative.",1125187200,3,1631,4.835125448028674
1865138,2,B00008WJBU,"""Intacto"" concerns a hidden subculture of people who can steal luck from others, and barter or win it from each other.  An intriguing concept, to be sure, and it makes for a good premise for a film.

A movie needs more than a high concept, though.  A fantasy like this demands a lot in its execution.  In particular, the script must establish an internal logic very early on, and follow that internal logic, in order to allow the audience to suspend their disbelief and enter into the fantasy.  ""Intacto"" unfortunately throws internal logic and common sense right out the window.  The characters' actions make no sense much of the time, and the script and direction obfuscate and confuse rather than advance any kind of plot.  Contrast this with the superior movie ""The Cooler,"" which also dealt with a man who could affect the luck of others.  Whatever its faults, and it had some, at least the basic premise of the cooler's relationship with luck & how it worked was set out early in the movie, and was comprehensible.

I'll give it an extra star for trying something different, and for generally good performances.  But, I wouldn't watch this again.  If you're at the video store at 11 pm on Friday and your only choices are this, ""Shattered Glass"" and some WWF videos, just go home and read a book.",1123200000,9,1302,4.641921397379913
1865139,3,B00008WJBU,"Intacto has an interesting premise:is there truly luck or simply fate. A more rational explanation might be cold randomness. The characters play incredulous games with the hope of winning luck. Winning someone's luck give you more luck. And I suppose that the loser is ""out of luck."" The ultimate test is for the person who thinks that he is lucky to challenge the Godfather of Luck. If someone beats the Godfather, then he becomes the new Godfather (a point that is never quite explained).

Throughout this story of good and bad luck, the director mixes love. The good fortune of the luckiest person on earth turns out to be not luck at all, but based on another's selflessness and love. You might think that anyone who owes his life to love given by another would lead his own life in a similar manner, but not in Intacto: Mr. Lucky shows little care for others. He's selfish.

The film also attempts to touch on the concept of ""truth,"" but fails because of conflicting actions. One one hand we have an aircraft accident survivor who's girlfriend did not make the same trip because he tells her ""I don't love you anyone."" This is confounding because the survivor ""saves"" the life of his lover by lying to her: he actually does love her. On the other hand, a policewomen does not love her husband, and not telling him so leads to his demise.

I like the story, the action, and the twists and turns. The film's downfall is a conflicting and confusing array of ideas that are touched upon, but never fully realized. Character development is also sketchy. I had little empathy for the strangers in Intacto, and therefore little emotional investment in the outcome. The film is, for lack of a better word, cold.",1116633600,4,1708,4.6490066225165565

It does something that few movies do these days...it uses images & actions instead of words to tell the story, and its twists and turns kept me guessing.  The first time I watched Intacto, I found myself wondering every 15-20 minutes, ""what the hell is going on? what am I missing?!""  Then, moments later, something would happen or be revealed that made everything else fall into place.  one of my top 5 favorite movies, I can't recommend it enough, even for those that hate subtitles, this movie is worth it!",1418342400,,615,4.554545454545455
