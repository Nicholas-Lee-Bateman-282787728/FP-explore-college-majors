947728,3,6305020000,"A good solid Kung Fu Movie - a monk finds and trains 5 young men
and in doing so knows that they will have to meet eventually
with a group of kung fu baddies planning to destroy Shaolin. The
downfall of the movie is using wires. It would have been a far
better movie if they didn't use the wires.",973814400,,296,3.95
947729,3,6305020000,"The box art looks real good, but I have never really taken to those  old-school ""comedic/slapstick"" kung-fu movies.  The fighting here  is good, but not special.  Jack Long has appeared in ""7  Grandmasters"" and ""36 Deadly Styles,"" both two tiers above  this one.",969148800,2,262,4.976744186046512
947730,3,6305020000,"Five fighters all with differents attributes are taken in as students by  an alcoholic, angry monk (mark Long).  He trains them in there own  specialties so that they can be ready to battle a band of tyrants led by  there white hair wizard master (Jack Long).  Good practice and fight  sequences and a surprisingly entertaining story line, including a great  rendission of ""this ol man.""",965174400,,387,4.861538461538461
947731,3,6305020000,"A typical ""bumpkin"" comedy with a story that is basically a Chinese martial arts version of ""The Dirty Dozen"". Most of the ensemble cast is skilled, acrobatic and fast (particularly Mark Long and  villain Jack Long). Disappointing finale emphasizes goofy acrobatics over  technique.",953337600,,282,5.534883720930233
7880503,2,6305020000,"Someone's been killing the monks of a shaolin temple, so the head abbot sends out a cranky old monk to investigate. This monk quickly gains five disciples (and one woman), and trains them for the inevitable showdown with the villain, the sorcerer Abbot White, and his five disciples.

The kung fu is fun (if a bit too reliant on wires) , but the film careens back and forth from bad comedy to serious action. The majority of it is watching the obnoxious monk beat up his students under the guise of training them, and then we are at the last battle. The ending isn't really satisfying, as it still tries to weave comedy into the fairly brutal fighting, and fails. The disciples have very little personality, but you can't help but like them just because of all the abuse the monk puts them through. The actual Shaolin monks do little more than say Buddha's name be praised over and over.

Not really worth watching unless you are a devoted fan of kung fu films.",1494806400,,961,4.517241379310345

7880505,3,6305020000,"Not my favorite martial arts flick. There are a lot of things to like about it, but equally as much to not like. I think I should have picked this one up at a flee market or something.",1372636800,,184,3.8684210526315788
7880506,5,6305020000,As a kid growing up in the island's I grew up watching martial arts movies. This is one of the oldies but goodies of which I enjoyed watching.,1360454400,,142,4.107142857142857
7880507,5,6305020000,"Five Fighters from Shaolin is another martial arts masterpiece,mostly from Taiwanese martial artists directed by Got Si Ho and Kam Bo. Five Fighters stars Jack Long,Mark Long,Chiang Sheng from the Five Deadly Venoms,Chen Shan,Sun Jung Chi,Alan Chui Chung San,William Yen.

An old drunken monk(Mark Long)goes around town and recruits five fighters to fight against Abbot White(Jack Long)and his troops.

Alan Chui plays an official who is under Abbot White. There is all types of fighting in this one from swords,staffs,hand to hand. Most of these martial artist were stuntmen and in this movie,you are able to see their acrobatics. Jack Long does the scissor kick that Liu Kang does in Mortal Kombat. You can see where it was influenced from. Chen Shan from Shaolin Vs Lama plays a hero and gets to show off some great kicking.

definitely a hidden classic,this version is the fullscreen one.there is now a widescreen vhs version on dvd from Jamal.",1355875200,,948,5.064102564102564
7880508,4,6305020000,"The kung fu action is pretty good with all the acrobatic moves, fast hand and leg combat.

The storyline is about a group of bad guys trying to steal a scripture from the shaolin temple for its own evil intention.  Then there is a rebel monk who got himself out of the temple to live with his own terms.  Soon the monk recruited 5 students.  They defend the shaolin temple from the evil group and for their own revenge.

The action is fast and great, the comedy is on point, and u have your typical martial arts storyline.  My only complaint is the dvd version.  Xenon company says that it is digitally restored but after seeing the movie it seems that the film was just copied straight from a VHS tape without restoration at all except for the sound.  The fight scene at night is dark that u have trouble seeing the action.  Overall, I still give it 4 star despite the dvd's fail restoration of a classic 80's kung fu movie.",1169164800,4,925,4.3313953488372094
7880509,2,6305020000,"The 2 stars go to the fighting monk and that's all; the rest of the movie is really poor.  The 5 fighters couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag and you could care less if all of them are sliced into gong bao ji ding (kung pao chicken).  Should be renamed ""The 5 Paper Tigers and a annoying girl can ruin your evening.""

Seriously- go look at my List ""Kung Fu for the Sole"" for some great movies- all of which happen to be cheaper than this one.

PS  I am usually impressed in Xenon's Digitally remastered DVDs (actually made me buy this one)... but this falls well short in quality and selection.",1123113600,3,602,4.2
7880510,5,6305020000,"Hello... no, i think i know what eveyones thinking, ""just another dull kung fu movie,"" and ""wheres Bruce Lee.""  Well clear those crab brained mind sets and get ready for the greatest action adventure ever to take place on your TV screen.  Watch as the 5 young Kung Fu students learn from the drunk, yet wise, shaolin master, in an array of training sequences that will leave you breathless and asking for more.  It also includes the famous ""message in a box"" kick, that is the most well known scene from all of Kung Fu movies.  These masters move so fast that they appear to be flying around the screen, that they'll make your head spin resulting in American Throw Up, Constantly!",1004486400,2,680,4.549180327868853
7880511,1,6305020000,"I ppurchased this movie because I am a Jack Long fan. After ,viewing five minutes of the film I thought that I was in for a bonus when I saw the ""6th student"" from the Venom movies(his only non-shaw brothers film and his last film before his death). 20 no, 15 minutes after watching the movie I was disgusted with it,too many wires no authenthic Kung-fu styles,I could nto believe that Jack and Mark would play in a movie like this .In fact it bothered me so much that I did some research and found that this film was made in a time when the period piece Kung-fu movies were on their way out the door and the ones that were being made at the time were gimmicky and used more wire/camera tricks then authenthic acrobactics. The thing that I found most interesting was that It was also the first movie that the Long brothers had done without Joeseph Kuo from the ""7 Grandmasters"",and ""World of the Drunken masters"" fame. I think it was a shame these two actors were great in their time ,unfortunately their time was short . Don't buy this one please pass ....please",1000339200,5,1063,4.401015228426396
7880512,5,6305020000,"This is without a doubt, the greatest kung fu movie ever!  The action is fantastic, and the training sequences are long and quite inventive.  This movie has a great cast of likeable heroes, and impressive villains that all fight like kung fu superheroes.  The master is the greatest character in movie history, and is not someone you would want to mess with.  This is one of the first kung fu flicks i saw, and it still is my favorite.  Everyone needs to see this movie at least once, so don't let the dull box discourage you, pick up this lost gem today!!!!....END",985824000,3,565,4.5
