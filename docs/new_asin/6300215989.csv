255311,4,6300215989,"Let's get one thing straight: This is not about a big-boned professor who wants to be thin, it doesn't star Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock is nowhere to be seen. This is some scary stuff! Scary, I tell you!  This professor  changes in entirely different ways than the one mr. Murphy portrayed so  beautifuly in his 1996 picture. I don't want to give away the plot, but  I'll just tell you that it's about a man who isn't happy with who he is,  and tries to do someting about it.  I can remember seeing this movie when I  was about 9, and I don't think I've ever been as scared as I was when the  professor drank the potion, and started to ""change"" After that  scene I got sick, and went to bed, but the memory has stayed with me  always. Now I'm 19, and can't wait for it to be realesed on DVD so I can  watch it again.  I guess that's all I have to say, so - bye!........",965260800,3,869,4.017543859649122
255312,5,6300215989,"Whether or not Jerry Lewis' ""Buddy Love"" is based on Dean Martin is so irrelevent...Simply speaking, this is probably one of the top 10  comedies of ALL TIME. From the opening credits backed by Les Brown's jazzy  score to the very end when 'Kelp' trips and crashes into the camera and  nearly falls right into our living rooms, this is one fantastic, funny (and  sometimes poignant) film. Everyone, young or old, owes it to him/herself to  watch this comedy masterpiece. And I defy ANYONE to not burst out in  hysterics during the scene when Kelp is in the gym and this guy hands the  barbells over to him...then watch the very next scene carefully while he's  in bed sleeping. Other standout scenes include Buddy Lester as a bartender  trying to make an Alaska Polar Bear Heater, The scene in Dr. Warfield's  office just after the explosion during the opening credits, and his dance  routine at the prom...Perfect timing, directing, and a stellar supporting  cast featuring Stella Stevens, Del Moore and Kathleen Freeman make this a  movie for all-time and I reccomend it to everyone.",965001600,4,1085,4.831521739130435
255313,5,6300215989,"I have seen this movie a number of times in my life,and i have never seen the connection between Buddy Love and Dean Martin! Professor Kelp is Jerry Lewis the actor and Buddy Love is Jerry Lewis the man. It's more like an  autobiography than anything else. I don't think Jerry ever meant for it to  be compared to his relationship with Dean. I think he meant for us to  realize he's human like everybody else,he has many great qualities but he's  not perfect. I love and admire him for both,faults and qualities. I also have  to say that I do not regard this as his masterpiece. I love it,but it's not  my favorite.",935712000,4,615,4.350877192982456

255413,1,6300215989,"I had never seen a Jerry Lewis movie before and I figured I had to see his most famous one since he just died.
That movie is cringe-worthy. The jokes fall flat and elicited zero chuckle from our audience (6 people, ages 7 to 41).
What's worse, the story line revolves around a professor who fantasize about a young female student (ugh). Men who are nice to women are portrayed as idiots and abusive men as heroes. One incarnation of Jerry Lewis is a not-funny village idiot; the other is an even-less-funny wannabe Don Juan.
Save yourself a couple hours: go take a walk in the park instead.",1504742400,,590,4.472222222222222
255414,4,6300215989,"This is a 1963 comedy movie that many consider to be the best movie of Jerry Lewis.  It is a fairly humorous time piece.  It is kind of a comedic version of Doctor Jekyll, Mister Hyde.  The movie provides a platform for Jerry Lewis to display some of his range.  That is probably my favorite aspect of the movie.  Beyond that I found the movie moderately enjoyable.  I know Eddie Murphy also did a version of this movie.  I have not seen it.

My personal favorite Jerry Lewis scenes are not in this movie.  I did laugh a few times.  I am glad I saw it, but I don't feel the need to watch it again.  Thank You...",1504483200,,611,4.093220338983051

255418,2,6300215989,"Was OK. Save your money and rent the new version with black actor Eddy Murphy. Eddy does a much much better job at keeping the laughs going, and the special effects in the Eddy Murphy movie are also top notch. Even my wife said this movie was not as good as Eddy's. In this movie Jerry Lewis comes off as some kind of con artist instead of a Romeo. He stagers as he seems to have become a chain smoking drunk trying to impress a girl that appears to be a much higher class than the character Jerry portrays. The movie also seems to portray that teachers have romantic interactions with students in school, which is, in nearly every school on the planet, grounds for being fired from the job. Again, Eddy Murphy's version, with two teachers falling for each other has a much better reality going for it then this old flick. I would give it one star if it wasn't for the excellent acting jerry Lewis does being the exact same person, looking pretty much the exact same way as each persona he becomes, but he could even full me as being two totally different people with the way he acted. Kudos to Jerry's acting. What he had to do as directed and written was marginal at best.",1497398400,,1174,4.340909090909091

The creativity they possessed to make such funny, dramatic, or any other genre of film, without the use of coarse or vulgar language, sexual innuendo (both implied or of the usual physical nature, i.e. breasts or lip readers everywhere), and computer generated and or blue screen constantly, will always be, a breath of fresh air.

255691,5,6300215989,"I would have called it The Goofy Professor, nonetheless, The Nutty Professor is still apropos.

This movie is classic Jerry Lewis. From his buck-toothed grin to his wobbly flailing legs and arms, chemistry professor Julius Kelp, played by the legendary comedian Jerry Lewis, is a social misfit. He blows up the school's laboratory, he faces bully humiliation from one of his students, worse of all, he has an unreturned crush on one of his students, Stella Purdy, played by the blue-eyed, blonde sexy bombshell Connie Stevens.

To solve his misfit, social maladroit, clumsy behavior, the professor heads to his laboratory. There, he concocts a secret formula to change himself into a suave, stud, good-looking, edgy lover boy. Presto! The concoction works. The professor changes to Buddy Love. No longer Professor Kelp, now Buddy Love, he works on seducing the cute Stella Purdy. Upon meeting Buddy Love, she's both seduced by his mysterious charm, but turned off by his obnoxious, overconfident, arrogant behavior. She, however, doesn't know Buddy Love is really the clumsy Professor Kelp.

This movie is a spoof of the 19th-Century Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Science works wonders, especially for Professor Kelp, he changes from a nerd to a babe magnet. It also changes his attitude about handling bullies. In one scene, he stares down and challenges the football goon classroom bully, who backs down. Throughout the ordeal Buddy Love keeps his affections lit for the classroom belle, Stella Purdy, who sees and is impressed by the professor's manhandling of the bully brute.

Nevertheless, to stay cool and strong, he needs to keep guzzling down, once in a while, his secret formula. Yet when he does, he's no longer The Nutty Professor, he's Mister Suave.  When he changes over into Buddy Love, he hangs out with the students at their local watering hole called The Purple Pit. At the nightclub, he's suave and rules the roost. He even takes on a new identity: a jazz singer, entertainer, for the nightclub. Purdy is so impressed.

One big problem, however. The formula could wear off, without warning, at any time. And it does at the oddest time. While performing as Buddy Love at the nightclub, he plays his hip jazz persona to  a student-packed nightclub. He starts his hip jazz swagger when his concoction suddenly wears off. His personalities switches from the cool Buddy Love to the geeky Professor Kelp The crowd, including Stella Purdy, are clueless and speechless.

Jerry Lewis not only starred in this very popular movie, but also co-wrote and co-produced it; he wore many hats. As far as his performance, Lewis gives the audience what it wants: a clumsy, nerdy, zany character to elicit laughs. And he has that magic formula to provoke laughter: comedic talent. This movie is funny. And sexy, thanks to blue-eyed blonde cutie Connie Stevens.

Throughout his glorious Hollywood career, Lewis had made plenty of silly, wacky, simply funny movies. This is one of them. Also in The Nutty Professor, advanced camera technology is used. The sharp, clear, Technicolor picture makes Lewis's antics even more eye-catching.  Science technology in 1963 is in full display in the movie.

For Jerry Lewis fans, which I am one, The Nutty Professor is a can't miss. For those not too familiar with the comedian, this movie is a good one to get to know his comedic talents. In my humble opinion (MHO) Lewis works on the visual aspect of comedy, especially physical comedy, better than anyone in show biz. It's not what you say, but how you do things: his comedy is for the eyes not the ears. And watching him simply makes me laugh.",1443139200,,3659,4.952691680261012

255976,5,6300215989,"Who can resist Jerry Lewis in buck teeth, a squalled speech impediment, and so clumsy that even Curly Howard would grin and say, ""Cointainly! Nyuk! Nyuk!"" I've always enjoyed the original version to Eddie Murphy's remake. Yes, yes! I know I'm an old fart, but to me, blowing up a room full of relatives with a toxic fart is puerile, not humor. I should know, because I had to put up with a childhood relative who did that every holiday.

I find very little distinction between Lewis' ""Buddy"" and Murphy's version. They were both obnoxious, over-bearing, unlikable, misogynistic, male, chauvinist pigs, but I think Lewis looked better doing it. Being an ""older"" person, I can see now that most of Lewis' construct of Buddy Love was mostly based on Dean Martin, his one-time comedy partner and straight man. The two didn't exactly split on good terms. As Lewis said later (quite politely), ""How long could I go on playing the monkey to Martin's organ grinder?""

So I suppose that The Nutty Professor was Jerry Lewis' chance to play both the monkey and the organ grinder all in one movie!

You owe it to yourself to see the original just to compare, but you won't be disappointed. Jerry is a one-of-a-kind genius who will never come along again.",1416182400,,1242,4.714285714285714

I had hoped it was more along the lines of Lewis's older stuff, but Lewis's scene of his agony of transformation, for example, is something more like a scene out of a thriller than a comedy, and then there was the fighting.  The way the women were portrayed was typical of the 60s (i.e. as some manner of sexual utility), but again not like what I'm used to from Lewis.

I would suggest to not watch the movie at all, but if you have to, I would wait until the children go to bed.",1408320000,2,577,4.088495575221239

256468,5,6300215989,"This is Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde seen through the eyes of Jerry Lewis. In The Nutty Professor(1962), Jerry Lewis plays shy, timid Professor Kelp. Today's kids are probably more familiar with the raunchy 1996 remake starring Eddie Murphy. In The Nutty Professor, shy, timid Professor Kelp gets beaten up by one of his students. The sexy, humane Stella(Stella Stevens) shows him some empathy. Kelp uses a serum that transforms him into the macho, sexy, smooth, cool, annoying Buddy Love. The music score by Walter Scharf is really good. Jerry Lewis does a good job blending cartoonish comedy with pathos and drama. A cameo from Lewis' son Gary was cut from the movie. Also, a ""sexy scene"" with Stella Stevens was also cut out!  Jerry Lewis was the ""Jim Carrey of the 1950's"". Carrey himself played Lewis on In Living Color. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were a duo until they started solo careers. Martin and Lewis were ""guest stars"" in the film My Friend Irma(1949). Lewis was one of the first filmmakers to film a scene with two cameras rolling at the same time. He could replay takes with camera one and develop the film in camera two later. Lewis has had a hit and miss career. The Day the Clown Cried(1972) was never finished or released and only seen by a handful of people. Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River(1968) is another dud in his career. Lewis also gave us good movies such as The Bellboy(1960), The Delicate Delinquent(1956) and At War With the Army(1951). In the 1996 remake, Eddie Murphy plays Dr. Klump, a kind, obese professor who uses a serum that turns him into an annoying thin man. The 1996 remake was updated with gross out humor and Murphy playing several other characters. There's a tear jerking scene where a comedian pokes fun of Dr. Klump for being overweight. The Nutty Professor(1962) is a classic that will still be enjoyable in the future.",1368835200,3,1878,4.725609756097561

256519,5,6300215989,"In 1963, Jerry Lewis co-wrote, directed, and starred in ""The Nutty Professor.""  Fifty years later, the humor in this movie remains as fresh and relevant as ever.  Among the bonus features is an interview with Jerry, who explained his take on the ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" story.  Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about the good and evil that exists in all people.  Jerry's story split his main character's personality into, to quote him, ""funny and not funny.""  Trust me, Jerry Lewis knows what's funny!  Jerry also clarified that Buddy Love was an amalgam of all the rude, obnoxious people he's observed in his life.  In no way was the Buddy Love character based on Dean Martin.  Speaking of characters, Professor Julius Kelp is the quintessential nerd, brilliant in his understanding of chemistry, but clueless in relating to people.  Stella Stevens as Stella Purdy is not only sexy and beautiful, she's not overshadowed in her scenes with Jerry, which is no easy task.  Del Moore (1916-1970) is great as the frustrated Dean Mortimer Warfield.  His scene reciting lines from Hamlet is hilarious.  Kathleen Freeman (1919-2001) turns in another solid performance as the dean's secretary, Millie Lemmon.  It's no wonder that she was in so many Jerry Lewis movies.

I saw this movie at a theater when it came out in 1963. It was an instant favorite then and still is! This is Jerry Lewis's masterpiece,
and the one he will be remembered for, Eddie Murphy's later take on it doesn't even compare. This movie meets my test of do I want to
watch it over and over. My shelves are now full of DVD's and it is surprising how few I can say that about. The other reviews have covered
the bases on this movie well enough. My point; if you don't have it, get it. Everyone needs a shelf of favorites for those days when your
cat dies or you find out your new girlfriend is not female. This movie needs to be on that shelf!",1298678400,,834,5.094890510948905
256603,5,6300215989,"Jerry Lewis is a genius, and you'll find no greater demonstration of that than ""The Nutty Professor.""  Forget Eddie Murphy; Lewis is the REAL Nutty Professor.  He's absolutely hilarious (the supporting cast is pretty funny too), but there's a surprisingly serious lesson taught in the movie's message.  (That comes out in Professor Kelp's confession toward the end of the movie.)  If you like good, clean humor, you'll love this movie.  It's absolutely hilarious.",1294444800,,463,5.287671232876712
256604,5,6300215989,"In other reviews, I've said that I believe Jerry Lewis created 3 cinematic masterpieces: ""The Bellboy,"" ""The Errand Boy,"" and ""The Nutty Professor.""  ""The Nutty Professor"" is the most complete of the 3 and the most widely acknowledged as his masterpiece.  All 3 films represent products of Lewis' auteur theory of filmmaking in which the director has complete control of the material.  Accordingly, Jerry not only directed and co-wrote ""The Nutty Professor"": he also stars in it.

His nerdy character, Professor Julius Kelp, has become a movie icon and a seminal character that others have either consciously or subconsciously imitated.  The voice, the hair, the teeth, and the mannerisms all add up to an immediate comedic reaction from the audience.  Apparently, Jerry was on an airplane with someone with that nerdy voice and from that brief encounter he developed the whole Nutty Professor character.  It's almost as much fun to watch Jerry morph into Buddy Love, the swaggering, egotistical playboy that is the opposite of Professor Kelp.  I like the early 60s cool he projects, in spite of his selfishness and meanness.  And his interactions with the dean of the college make me laugh just as much as the nerdier antics of Professor Kelp.

Like most of Lewis' other films, this one is chock full of funny scenes, such as when Professor Kelp goes to work out with a barbell, when Buddy Love first comes into the Purple Pit and asks for a drink called an Alaskan Polar Bear, when we get to see Professor Kelp as a baby, and when the potion begins to wear off and we see Buddy Love begin to turn back to Professor Kelp right in the middle of the song ""That Old Black Magic.""  There are too many other funny scenes to mention but what makes this Lewis' most complete film is that he produces as much comedy as the best of his other films but also manages to make a coherent story that engages the viewer.

Someone like me is always roots for the underdog, so it's nice to see a Professor Kelp of the world succeed in the end.  I should also add that there's something about the ambience of the film (Lewis is always aware of space and design in his best films) that appeals to me immensely.  In fact, I want to go out tonight to the Purple Pit, if only there were one in town.

It's safe to say that if you don't appreciate ""The Nutty Professor"" then you're likely to be one of those people who can't stand Jerry Lewis.  Even if you've seen some of Jerry's inferior movies, you owe it to yourself to at least watch the original ""The Nutty Professor.""",1293753600,,2552,4.5758241758241756

THE GOOD- This has a much nicer tone to it than the re-make, of course, (restrictions back then when this was released). The speech at the end of the movie by the professor (Lewis) was outstanding: touching with some profound statements. Some earlier comic bits were funny, beginning with Lewis in the Dean's office. Perhaps the best humor was simply provided by Lewis making faces when he played the nerdy science prof. His other character is not appealing, but it's not supposed to be. However, I got tired a seeing a cigarette dangling out of his mouth. (This was supposed to be a takeoff on Dean Martin). Stella Stevens was a pretty woman, except for the excessive eye makeup that was the style of the '60s. Some of the dated expressions in here were funny to hear.

THE BAD - A number of Lewis' bits were not that humorous and his singing was atrocious. Why almost all entertainers - comedians, actors, etc - back then thought they were also good singers, is beyond me. You can just fast-forward through Jerry's songs.",1238371200,2,1215,4.54337899543379
256643,4,6300215989,"In a performance reminiscent of Peter Sellers in `Dr. Strangeglove,' Eddie Murphy turns in a tour de farce in `The Nutty Professor.' This was a film I had intended to see for a decade and I was certainly not disappointed when I finally rented it.  Murphy provides a charming performance as shy, gentlemanly fat man, Prof. Sherman Klump. One cannot help rooting for the 400-pound professor to woo foxy grad student Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett Smith), rather than egomaniacal alter ego Buddy Love. Larry Miller is also fun as the smiling but malevolent Dean Richmond a type role he has played several times before.  Of course the special effects wowed audiences in 1991 and they are still quite impressive. I haven't seen the 1963 Jerry Lewis version and pray I never have to, but I doubt that it had the charm of this production. Pinkett Smith adds not only beauty, but a warm grace and dignity to an otherwise chaotic scene of runaway gerbils, wild night spots and bizarre potions. David Chappelle, meanwhile, is entertaining as obnoxious stand-up comic Reggie Warrington. And, of course, there are the Klumps. Murphy outdoes himself as Sherman's dysfunctional, farting family. While I have no real desire to see the 2000 sequel, which apparently focuses on the Klump family, they do add some fun to the film.  Overall, I would call `The Nutty Professor' a solid comedy with plenty of laughs, lots of charm, and even a bit of a message.",1223769600,,1434,4.821138211382114

256647,5,6300215989,"I saw this film when I was 9.  Was I impressed?  Yes--I've never forgotten this great film--great special effects before computer enhancement, all the brainchild of Jerry Lewis--who demonstrates not only his great comic talent, acting ability, but also many other character qualities that made him one of the infamoous Rat Pack of the 1960s.

The two characters, Professor Kelp and Buddy Love, couldn't be more different--and yet both have a grip of the heart of Stella--the stunning blonde college student in a Chemistry class.  She is one of many stunning beauties at the off-campus, off-limits (to faculty) Purple Pit where Professor Kelp, enhanced by chemistry, becomes Buddy Love.  However, there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip (I have been waiting years to use that one!)--which enhances Buddy's mysteriousness (and appeal) to Stella--despite his boorish, egotistical, stereotypical clumsy (but masculine) approach to his dream girl (really, the Professor's dream girl).

I mentioned many times to my Eddie Murphy fan ""best girl"" that she'd have to see Jerry Lewis in the Nutty Professor to see the real deal...I think she doubted it, but halfway through she exclaimed ""this is my favorite comedy""--high praise from an intelligent movie consumer from a distant land, far, far away!

There is no other way to hype this movie--except that, if you were born after the 1960s, and missed many of the classic films of that era, the would be a great starting place to fill in the gaps (of your understanding of American Pop Culture).  The Nutty Professor exposes all of those remakes (Ocean's Eleven, for example) for the paltry copies they really are.

The price, though, made me vaguely suspicious about the quality of the disk, but I decided at the very least I'd be able to watch my favorite scenes when I wanted to.

It turns out this is an excellent edition. Most notably, the print is perfectly sharp, almost pristine, and it preserves W.W. Kelly's tricky cinematography -- the movie's wild and diverse colors sometimes look blurry and oversaturated when this is shown on TV.

And rather than being bare bones, this disk is loaded with extras: A commentary by Lewis and Steve Lawrence (which is, admittedly, a little on the quiet side); a fine documentary about Lewis' peak solo films; a chatty documentary about the making of the movie itself; a large gallery of press materials and deleted scenes; trailers and other odds and ends.

Professor Kelp could no longer stand the humiliation, and seeks to improve himself. He learns his lessons in a most touching way, and makes the viewer feel a touch of that also. ""Be yourself.""

I must also add a note about Lewis' comic genius, as he is chaparoning the dance, and the swing orchestra is playing a hip tune, nerdy Prof. Kelp is letting a little of his fun side take over in small bits and pieces.

256706,5,6300215989,"Before Eddie Murphy played the role, Jerry Lewis perfected it. If you loved Murphy in ""The Nutty Professor,"" you'll love the original.

Is this a guy movie or a chick flick?

Imagine doling out a few dollars to take your best gal to a Saturday picture in 1963, and Jerry Lewis was the star. It is a guy's movie, right? It has slapstick, womanizing, and even good music. Certainly a guy would love this, but could a woman? Since when is Jerry Lewis known for making a chick flick? Yes! The underlying tale may be a complex discussion of genetic manipulation, but the main story is love.

As stereotypical guy movies and chick flicks tend to be more accepted by the other gender than we prefer sometimes to admit, ""The Nutty Professor"" has it all.

Can awkward scientist Professor Julius Kelp woo his student, the charming and beautiful Stella Purdy (played by Donna Reed look-alike and Playboy model Stella Stevens)? What about the man of every hour, Buddy Love, Kelp's chemically discovered alter-ego? Who will Stella love?

Problems ensue when Kelp's bird eats the formula for the Kelp-Love transformation. His parents have a copy, but will there be enough for Kelp to become Love for his big moment performing on stage.

Lewis does a fine job holding down both roles. Stevens never steals the show. Even though someone like her being smitten by Professor Kelp is hard to swallow, she never camps it up to ruin the fantasy.

Trivia bit:

Professor John Frink, the Hank Azaria character on TV's ""The Simpsons"" is based on Lewis' Kelp.

I fully recommend ""The Nutty Professor.""

His alter ego Buddy Love may be a take on Jerry's former partner Dean Martin, but he is smooth and silky at his best.  When looking at what Eddie Murphy did later in his adaptation of this 1963 classic, one can say Murphy's is probably more consistently funny, but one can't deny the impact of watching a comic genius like Lewis at work; he even does a nice job in his big speech at the prom, going smoothly from the self assured Buddy Love to the cocooned Kelp.

256760,5,6300215989,"I finally watched my first ever Jerry Lewis movie. In all my 44 years, i've never had the desire to watch even just one Jerry Lewis film. In retrospect, I always had wrong pre-conceived notions about him based on the few very short film clips I may have seen of him in the past, and his goofy slapstick-like approach. I now know this guy is pure genius, and I couldn't stop smiling and laughing throughout the whole movie. His acting ability and facial expressions are second to none, and he played the roles of 'Dr. Julius Kelp' and the 'Rat Pack' meets Andrew Dice Clay-like attitude-challenged swinger 'Buddy Love' 'to a T'!  I now realize where some of Jim Carrey's inspiration comes from as well! The cinematography was superb too. Gotta dig that groovy 'Purple Pit' lounge!

256761,4,6300215989,"The Nutty Professor was and is Jerry Lewis' finest hour as a film maker.  From the genuinely frightening transformation scene (graced with terrific scary music) to the sublime POV tracking shot as people react to the Professor's new appearance, the ""Jer"" was truly at the top of his game as director.  It's sad, then, that none of his later films would come close to this level of invention...maybe the pill addiction was taking too great a toll on him.

From a pure laugh out loud standpoint, the remake with Eddie Murphy has this one beat.  But the original has its share of hilarious moments too, most notably in Jerry's failed ""pre-formula"" attempts to make himself more attractive, including some hilarious sight gags at a gymnasium.

Having seen both versions now, some interesting contrasts do come up.  First, Professor Klump is much funnier as played by Lewis than Murphy, with impeccable comic timing with his many klutzy mishaps.  I italicize funnier, because Murphy turns out to be the better actor with the Klump role, giving the sad sack professor (this time handicapped with obesity) genuine depth and pathos missing from Lewis' interpretation.

Lewis, however, gets the acting chops awards as Buddy Love, the alter ego.  Whereas Murphy's Love comes across as merely a sexually overheated jerk, Lewis brings a genuine sense of menace to the role-as if he could become violent at any moment--in addition to being a womanizer.

In the final analysis, both the Lewis and Murphy versions are well worth watching. In terms of inventive filmmaking and creativity, however, Lewis' take on the Robert Lewis Stevenson classic is the one to buy, as it offers the most rewards for repeat viewings.",1133481600,,1701,5.0
256762,5,6300215989,"Jerry Lewis' performance in the 1963 classic comedy, The Nutty Professor, is by far his funniest.  Who said he couldn't make it without Dean?  Lewis does quite fine playing a bumbling nerd-like chemistry professor, Dr. Julius Kelp, who strives to fit in with his students as well as with the faculty.  He concocts a solution, which turns him into hip and cool alter ego, Buddy Love, who serenades to his fans as well as one of his student's, Stella Stevens, at the local nightclub to ""Black Magic.""  With Love's every move, he entrances everyone he comes across, and becomes an Elvis-like idol that everyone swoons over by just the mention of his name.  However, in the end, Kelp and Love's identities clash, and it only goes to show that chemistry isn't all what it's cracked up to be.  Does Kelp end with Stevens' or does Love end up with her?  Watch and see.

The original Nutty Professor is an extremely funny film with a bowl full of laughs as well as jumping' and jivin' tunes from Lewis and one of the king's of swing, Les Brown and his Band of Renown.

This is also a visually beautiful film with astonishing use of color. A real treat on that count alone. It's also a splendid updating of Jekyll and Hyde with real relevance for modern times.

256766,4,6300215989,"Paradox completists eventually must turn to la mystere de Jerry -- why is it that French film masters such as Godard and Truffaut so loved Jerry Lewis? The Franco-Lewis thing has become a well-worn joke -- something to swig down with Freedom Fries -- but it's a safe bet the directors weren't thinking of the braying, pratfalling side of the American comedian.

Instead, the new wavers cited Lewis' work from the early 1960s -- including what arguably are his best films as an actor and director: ""The Nutty Professor"" and ""The Bellboy.""

Paramount, Lewis' longtime studio, has released both titles in splendid widescreen versions, along with seven of his other films. Some titles come with full or partial commentaries from Lewis and his pal Steve Lawrence; other modest bonus features are spread about the collection.

""The Nutty Professor,"" from 1963, looks amazing in widescreen, awash in hot circus colors. Seeing Lewis' film in its original aspect ratio reveals the director's dedication to offbeat and rewarding visuals. The film earns its Special Edition tag with a vivid transfer, feature-length commentary, making-of featurette and a half-hour career survey called ""Jerry Lewis at Work."" Screen tests, outtakes and promos complete the package. Paramount isn't known for breaking a sweat with catalog-title extras, but this is a solid collection.

The plot -- a buck-toothed college teacher brews up a formula that transforms him into an obnoxious ladies' man -- allowed Lewis to revisit the yin-yang comic dynamic he first developed with smoothy Dean Martin. Lewis played both roles.

Speculation that the professor's swinging chemical creation, Buddy Love, was based on the real-life Martin elicits an emphatic denial. ""This could never be Dean,"" Lewis says. ""I loved Dean."" Love was ""a conglomeration of every unkind, nasty SOB I had seen all of my life.""

Lewis gives love interest Stella Stevens a lot of credit for the film's success, saying she made scenes sparkle by listening so intently to his dialogue. ""She was about the best actress I had ever worked with."" Edith Head's sensual outfits and cinematographer Wally Kelley's close-ups intensified Stevens' already potent sex appeal.",1104537600,21,2201,5.256410256410256

Jerry's portrayal of Professor Kelp/Buddy Love is superb. As a director, Lewis shows remarkable style and timing. There are many classic setpieces, but the highlight is the Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation sequence that introduces Buddy Love. Jerry also assembled his finest cast, with memorable contributions from co-star Stella Stevens, Del Moore, Kathleen Freeman, Buddy Lester and Howard Morris.

Who will win out Professor Kelp or Buddy Love?

How anyone could rate this classic Jerry Lewis comedy less than 5 stars is beyond me, but we all see things differently when it comes to movies. When you talk about a comedy legend and pure comic genius, Jerry Lewis has to be in the top ten of all time. In the 1970's they used to have movie theme week on Channel 7 out of Detroit and as a 10 year old I would race home after school to watch them.

Paramount Studios has done a great job with this DVD release, the picture is clear and crisp and the audio in 5.1 surround sound is fantastic. This DVD version is better than any TV or VHS version I've ever seen. The comedic genius of Jerry Lewis and his brand of hilarity add a whole new dimension to this classic Jekyll & Hyde tale. If you're looking for a movie that's not offensive and can entertain the whole family, than the original ""Nutty Professor"" is the one for you.

Jerry Lewis isn't getting any younger, so my only complaint is that there should have been a commentary or interview as a special feature included while he's still around to do it. I sure hope an ultimate Jerry Lewis collection is in the works, filled with tons of extras. Viva la Jerry Lewis!

256793,5,6300215989,"This is one of Lewis's richest films, one in which technical perfection meets considerable thematic depth. Professor Kelp is a soul whose few contacts with the sensible world lead to complications; people mock him because of his inability to accomplish concrete actions. Suddenly troubled by sensible beauty (S. Stevens), Kelp feels the need to have a body that will enable him to satisfy his desire. This body (Buddy Love), in direct contrast to Kelp, is comfortable only when pursuing entirely material endeavors; Love is especially at ease at the Purple Pit, an echo of Plato's cave in the way it manufactures illusions and crude dreams. Kelp's embodiment is not complete, as soul and body soon start to interact (when Buddy speaks like Kelp and vice-versa). The merging of both is foreshadowed by three clues: a) Buddy avenges Kelp by humiliating the head of the University; b) as the prom night begins, Kelp uncharacteristically starts to dance, led by instinct alone; c) Buddy's more decent behavior when he performs for the students, a bit later. A performance which is interrupted by the ultimate transformation and Kelp's ensuing confession. The film's conclusion is far from a happy ending: despite Kelp's vow to accept himself as he is, he now moulds his appearance and demeanor after Buddy Love's and has been corrupted by Buddy's fascination with artificiality. The fact that Kelp would return two years later in 'The Family Jewels' as a photographer - i.e. as a reproducer of the sensible world - is revealing. A major work from an underrated artist.",1080777600,5,1564,5.042471042471043

While the modern adaptation was stuffed with crass, in your face jokes, Lewis' creation has a gentle and innocent humour and you care about what happens to Kelp's character.
 The music scenes in particular are brilliant and the scene where the truth comes out is surprisingly touching.

256797,4,6300215989,"Hollywood legend, Jerry Lewis had great success teaming with Dean Martin in the early years of his career. While partnered with Martin, Lewis's wacky slapstick antics did reach extremes, but he was usually pulled back, before going too far, for too long. After the partnership dissolved, and Lewis began producing and directing his own films, he continued to expand on the same gag based, physical comic style that characterized his earlier work. Like him or not, Jerry is Jerry. The difference now, was that Lewis was primarily responsible for keeping himself from going over the top, and sometimes he did not know when he had gone too far.
The Nutty Professor, one of Jerry's most popular movies, is done in typical Lewis style. Stringing together various comedic episodes, and physical gags, the movie is a comedic variation of the Jekyll and Hyde dual identity story, with Jerry assuming the roles of nerdy, bespectacled college professor ""Julius Kelp"", and his alter ego, the ultra hip, and cool, mystery man, ""Buddy Love"".
After being humiliated in class, in an incident with a football player, the mild mannered chemistry professor decides he needs to improve his physical condition. His resolve to do this, is reinforced when his lovely, blue-eyed student Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens), assures him that his slight physical stature really doesn't matter. After trying ""normal"" means to improve his physical condition by working out at a gym, Kelp turns to chemistry, trying to develop a formula to improve man's physical development. Reaching the crucial testing stage, for the sake of science, and in the quest for knowledge, Kelp tests the formula on himself. Drinking it down, he then undergoes a dramatic and startling transformation into a super slick playboy type, Buddy Love.
Buddy is of course everything that Kelp isn't. Smooth, suave and sophisticated, Love makes his first public splash in an appearance at the ""Purple Pit"", the local teen hangout, attired in a striking blue suit. There he orders his favorite drink, an ""Alaskan polar bear heater"", and impresses the teens with his singing ability. Stella, the target of Buddy's attention, is not totally enamored by the narcissistic swinger's charm, but still finds herself strangely drawn to him.
With Lewis more or less under control, the comedic episodes, particularly those with Buddy, are entertaining, and flow together more smoothly and than in most of his other films. Some highlights include a bit where Love gets the head of the college to climb up on top of a table to perform Shakespeare in his underwear, and Kelp's goofy dancing to the song ""Leapfrog"" (A real ""toe-tapper""). Kelp is perplexed by the transformation process, but his scientific objectivity is clouded by the fact when he appears as Buddy Love, he is able to approach his secret heartthrob, not as her teacher, but as a man. Things eventually come to a head, when both Kelp and Love are to appear at the same function, at the same time. Kelp's speech on stage is rather moving,...actually.
Lewis is a filmmaker, much like Clint Eastwood, who enjoys working with those he favors, and has the power to make it happen. This film features Kathleen Freeman, Del Moore, Buddy Lester and Milton Frome. Not the most well known names, but all have worked with Lewis numerous times. Moore is terrific, as Doctor Warfield. Jerry's films sometimes feature some obscure choices as his leading lady, but that is not the case here, as sexy Stella Stevens is perhaps one of the most well known actresses ever to be in one of his solo projects. She more than holds her own, going one on one in verbal jousts with Buddy Love. Stella also makes quite a transformation from pigtailed student, to young lady out on the town.
The Nutty Professor works on most levels. There are excesses to be sure, but the Jekyll and Hyde story at its core, has always had an appeal. Buddy Love, does have a hypnotic attraction, and Professor Kelp is the middle-aged version of the kind of bumbler that Lewis has always played. Released on DVD in 2000, this surprisingly still remains one of the few Jerry Lewis films available on DVD, and the transfer is excellent. Full of vibrant colors, we get a great look at the Edith Head's costumes, and the sets. Orchestra leader, Les Brown and his Band of Renown, make an appearance too. Not much in the way of extras, but if you want to enjoy what many consider one of his finest efforts, The Nutty Professor is classic Jerry Lewis. The high cost is a negative.

For a really good family movie, full of laughs, you can't beat Jerry Lewis, especially as the Nutty Professor.",1524096000,,385,4.133333333333334
