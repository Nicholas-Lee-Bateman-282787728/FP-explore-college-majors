8173663,4,B000MZHVKU,Gigi has managed to avoid using several annoying phrases that bugged me in the original Dirty Sala DVD set and this explanation of Rueda is an excellent introduction to the dance.,1324944000,,179,4.806451612903226
8173664,5,B000MZHVKU,"The Instruction:

This multi award winning DVD is a superb way to learn team dancing, where one switches partners after each combination while dancing in a circle. One would think this would be chaotic to teach, but instructors Gigi and Nick know how to do it, and do it well. After the initial demonstration with music of how team dances are done using four couples, Gigi and Nick break it down and teach us the patterns, and at this stage you will have to be knowledgeable of the basic steps and combinations, which can be learned in previous Quick and Dirty Guides (Beginners, Intermediate, and Advanced, or all 3 in a boxed set), so that when Gigi says ""Dile que no"" your feet will know what to do...otherwise you will get lost in the circle here, even though very advanced combinations are not used.

DVD Options:

The different angles one can view the dancers with is very helpful, and I have a preference for the ""High,' which gives you a good sense of the flow and patterns, and also one can pick up the combinations taught individually in a ""Lessons"" menu. This is a very well produced DVD, and the lessons take place in what looks like a large ballroom, with a gleaming though well worn wood floor. The dancers are nicely matched, and Gigi and Nick are an attractive pair to learn from. Team dancing is a wonderful activity for friends and family to share, and is great exercise too! This DVD will teach you all the necessary steps and patterns, the fun and added bond to your friendships is up to you!",1177545600,,1512,4.510948905109489
8173665,5,B000MZHVKU,"Called ""Casino Rueda"" this wheel-like dance formation creates a beautiful effect on the dance floor ... plus it brings good friends even closer together. Synchronized salsa dancing in a group is fun and exciting. It is joyous and thrilling to learn and master these dance movements. Gigi is a superb master dance instructor. She provides clear, precise directions in how to accomplish various dance moves along with Nick, her coinstructor, who is also a highly effective teacher. Together this very talented dance couple demonstrate and explain how to do groups of steps in a logical sequence to accomplish many polished and smooth dance movements. While two, three or four couples can dance ""Casino Rueda"" style, in this DVD there are a total of four couples who demonstrate some of the varieties of dance step possibilities. They all maintain a synchrony and harmony that is astonishing to view. The best part is, all the movements on this DVD can be mastered by following and practicing the steps taught by Gigi and Nick. The unique feature on this DVD: multiangle programming allows the student to view the steps from different angles. This gives the student a choice of the best view from which to learn the special foot and arm movement combinations in any dance sequence. Mastering unfamiliar movements is much easier when viewed from different angles, it feels like having a *live* dance instructor performing right before your own eyes.

Some of the dance movements taught on this DVD are: dame, dame otra, dame dos, adios, enchufla dame, enchufla doble, el uno, candado, enchufla pa'l medio con dos, derecha, izquierda, el cero, el ocho and dile que no. Either Gigi or Nick will first do a demonstration and verbalize a count, ""forward two, three, and back two three"", or ""first step on the left, the gentleman is waiting for you on the left"" ""delegeno, four, five, six"" and ""back from dame"" ... You do the dance steps along with them. You do the counting, watch the video and imitate the step sequence. You can replay the sequence, from any one of three different angles to review and practice. Let me reassure the reader, these steps can be mastered and are very exciting to learn. The dance steps make sense and fit the music. Even as a single person, you can learn the male or female part of the dance without a partner, I did without much difficulty.

These dance movements are beautiful to watch and a pleasure to learn and master. It is a joy learning salsa with Gigi and Nick. They are superior, outstanding dancers and instructors. Let me assure the reader,  this couple makes you feel you are learning to dance with a group of friends. Also, the couples who participate in the demonstrations could be people you know, the only difference may be they do not stumble or forget any of the steps. However, owning this DVD provides the student *exactly* the *same* opportunity they had, to keep practicing and becoming proficient in dancing Casino Rueda style salsa.

8173666,4,B000MZHVKU,"As I always note when I review these dance instruction DVDs, I am not a dancer.  And maybe that is a good thing.  I can view the disk as a beginner and share what it looks like to me and you can be the judge if this disk is for you.

This is the fourth in ""The Quick and Dirty Guide to Salsa"" series.  Where the first three taught the individual couple increasingly sophisticated moves, this shows how to use multiple pairs, here four couples, how to dance as a group or team.  What is especially nice about this DVD is that it was shot using three cameras and you can easily switch between the views using the ""angle"" button on you DVD remote control.  You can see the normal front view, or an angled top down view (it isn't straight down like the June Taylor dancers on the old Jackie Gleason show), or the back view that is 180 degrees from the front view.  Or you can watch the whole 35-minute presentation three times complete from each view by selecting the one you want from the main menu.

To me, it seemed like an interesting update to the square dancing that was popular when I was a kid.  You have a caller, you have multiple pairs, moves involve passing partners between the pairs, doing figures, walking (promenade) around the square or circle, and all the other fun stuff.  But you get to do it to some really cool and popular Salsa Music.  The moves themselves have a nice grace to them, too.

The instructors are very helpful and they do things several times to help the viewer practice it on his or her own.  All the dancers are good and are inviting to even a novice like me.  It is a very nice disk for a very fun activity.",1173484800,,1642,4.254838709677419
8173667,5,B000MZHVKU,"Style : Miami Rueda

Level : Beginners to Rueda teachers.

Without doubt the instructional Cuban dance dvd's produced by Debdoot Das are the finest on the market. This new dvd on Team dancing is great.

The 3 angle instructional makes learning & teaching this style easy.

This dvd puts all the Rueda moves together.

The dancers are all great. The moves nice & have a good flow.

This is a stand alone dvd which can be just brought on it's own, but we do recommend you buy all the other dirty salsa dvd's to increase your moves.

Highly recommended.",1172793600,3,550,4.494949494949495
