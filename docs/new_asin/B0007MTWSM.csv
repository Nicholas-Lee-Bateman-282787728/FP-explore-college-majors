2220058,5,B0007MTWSM,"This is a great way to gain insight into authentic Tai Chi. Master Ho is a true Chinese Master of the art.  His dialogue throughout may seem a little corny, but after viewing a few times, he and his assistant(the perfect Miss Malory) make great old friends who have actual personalities! Definately refreshing to see the forms done with such precision. A sweet, if slightly dated, and groovy way to get in some QUALITY Tai Chi time. Includes ALL correct forms, temple exercises & more.. not new-age yuppie adaptations!",1154390400,10,518,4.820224719101123
8048932,4,B0007MTWSM,Picture is a bit too dark. I have assumed it has to do with the age of the original which I recall being on VHS a number of years back and was not much brighter. Transfer to DVD did not make much difference in picture clarity. I still really like this disc for learning Tai'Chi.,1509235200,,278,4.072727272727272

8048935,3,B0007MTWSM,I found it rather boring. There were a lot of separate moves with allegorical names.  David Dorian Ross wins over this hands down.,1399075200,,130,4.6521739130434785

8048937,5,B0007MTWSM,BEST TAI CHI CHUAN VIDEO ON THE MARKET.  I'D RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE SEEKING A TAI CHI VIDEO.  I'VE SEEN OTHERS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD.,1363910400,2,130,4.16
8048938,4,B0007MTWSM,"I learned tai chi chuan from Marshall in the late '60. I became an instructor and have continued practicing over the subsequent years. If you have no prior experience with tai chi this is a good place to start. You will learn the correct external form of the Yang large style. This is just the 27 short form but you will have enough grounding so you can begin to learn the 108 long form in the future if desired.

There is a great deal more to be learned than can be given in this short video,I still have original VHS, but I find myself coming back to it every now and then to refresh my memory of the patient and good friend that Marshall became. You will not learn the internal mechanics or energy circulation from this DVD but that is something to look forward to...tai chi chuan is a life long and very beneficial practice.

For those who wish more advanced material I recommend Bruce Frantzis&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bagua-and-Tai-Chi-Exploring-the-Potential-of-Chi-Martial-Arts-Meditation-and-the-I-Ching/dp/1583943595/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bagua and Tai Chi: Exploring the Potential of Chi, Martial Arts, Meditation and the I Ching</a>.",1358035200,4,1200,5.481081081081081
8048939,5,B0007MTWSM,For those who are housebound or find themselves working in a limited capacity in public due to health issues; Marshall Hoo's dvd provides a good regimen of the 27 tai chi forms.  The temple exercises that precced the lessons in tai chi are of good value as well.  I plan on coming back to this one time and again along with tai chi for arthritis which I plan to purchase later.,1351123200,,377,4.295774647887324
8048940,4,B0007MTWSM,"Marshall Hoo is a master of Tai-chi. This disk is a copy of the original VHS tape, so watching this is like the watching the VHS. You'll need to do alot of fast fowarding to get to parts that you are interested in. That being said if you are seriously interested in Tai-chi, this would be worth while to get.",1305072000,3,308,4.15
8048941,4,B0007MTWSM,"i did finally receive it--just took longer than expected.
It is Marshall Ho'o and he is wonderful.
Even has an alternative movement to ""snake creeps down""
the Temple exercises are my main stay.
It really needs a ""section"" or ""chapter"" finder.
I really hope it comes back on the market soon.
