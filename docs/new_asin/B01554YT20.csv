8732697,4,B01554YT20,"'The Guilty' is a three piece drama that could have been reduced to a two episode series. ITV has a reputation for excel,eat drama/murder/mystery series. This one has its moments, and all in all deserves a look.

Tamsin Greig, plays DC Maggie Brand, a policewoman who works diligently to solve the case. In fact, her husband complains she spends too many hours at work. At home she and her husband have a son who is having all sorts of problems at home and at school. At work we juggle between the present and 2008, when a four year old went missing from his home.  Greig is called into the five year old case when the body of a child, later found to be the missing boy, Callum Reid, was found by workmen digging in the garden of the child's home. The investigator in 2008 seems to have overlooked many clues, and the case was never solved. Greig now leaves no stone unturned into solving the murder.

Several suspects are at play, all are investigated thoroughly, and a surprising twist and turn gives this drama some play. The storyline is one we have seen several times, and it was tempting to guess the ending. Tamsin Greig was the real deal, a woman dedicated to her job, but also dedicated to her child and marriage. I would like to see her in a series as a DC solving crimes and making her family life successful. This series was seen on the US's PBS, not well publicized but well received.

Recommended. prisrob 11-15-15",1447545600,2,1428,4.480769230769231
8732698,3,B01554YT20,"The Guilty is a missing child mystery that first aired on Great Britains ITV in 2013. It was a three-part miniseries, each part only 45 minutes long. The set-up is familiar  a cold case, prevaricating parents, police incompetence, new evidence, and now a new investigator. Four-year-old Callum Reid (Daniel Runacres-Grundstrom) disappeared early one morning or perhaps during the night- from his upper crust neighborhood in 2008, leaving anguished parents and bewildered brother Luke to wonder what happened. Five years later, in 2013, a makeshift coffin with Callums body inside is discovered in a garden across the street from his home. But it clearly was not there when the case was investigated in 2008. DCI Maggie Brand (Tamsin Greig), who had to quit the 2008 investigation due to pregnancy, is given the task of redeeming the police department, whose original investigation produced only scandal. She starts from the beginning, interviewing every witness anew.

This is familiar territory. And its predictable but I cant think of any recent television mystery that isnt. The guilty party is heavily hinted at by the start of the second episode, though there is a little twist. I like this treatment, though. I like that 2008 and 2013 are juxtaposed without explanation. The film just jumps back and forth. The narrative from 2008 has the quality of early color home movies in the 1970s, which is odd for the time period, but that is enough to distinguish it from the 2013 narrative. The police officers jump right in and talk about the old case as if we knew what they are talking about. This is unnerving at first, but I appreciated it more as the series progressed. It doesnt waste time on backstory. Down-to-earth DCI Brand is a character weve seen before, but Tamsin Greig gives her an understated determination and frustration that doesnt boil over too soon. In three parts, The Guilty is well-paced. Watching 135 minutes straight through might seem too long.",1447459200,11,1971,5.0244648318042815
8732699,2,B01554YT20,"Poor editing.  This production was much longer than necessary. Edited down, would have made a fairly good 1.5 hour film.  Halfway through the first episode, we figured out, for the most part, what had happened (with a slight twist at the end), so everything seemed to drag on from that point forward.  The reason given for certain actions taken by a key figure (don't want to reveal too much), and then keeping silent for years, simply was implausible.  The detective's side story wasn't particularly well executed, either, made worse by a child actor who couldn't carry off playing an autistic person.  I had previously seen Darren Boyd only in comedy, and love his work.  He did a fine job in this dramatic role -- too bad the script was so clumsy.",1447113600,9,750,4.687022900763359
