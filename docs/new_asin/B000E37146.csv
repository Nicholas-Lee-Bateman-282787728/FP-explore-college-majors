8104937,2,B000E37146,"With just a limited time to study the Columbine shootings, and with limited access to the parents and friends of the shooters, the Investigating Reports team puts together a shallow analysis of why the shootings occurred. The team, intending to get into the minds of Dylan and Harris, end up making no more than educated guesses about what drove the young men to murder and suicide. The investigators suggest that bad parenting and a bullying school culture were to blame, as well as media dwelling overmuch on mass murders. All of this may well be true. But the paucity of firsthand evidence makes the case extremely weak. In the end, I saw this film as just another way to fill up 44 minutes of air time and to re-air pictures of shot-out windows, grieving friends and emergency vehicles. The IR ""explanation"" of the tragedy is almost guaranteed not to advance insight into thr case, and will have absolutely no effect on the frequency of future incidents.",1346112000,,958,4.77710843373494
8104938,1,B000E37146,"NOTE: I have given this title one star because it is not possible to post a review with no stars. In addition, I will not flag this review as containing spoilers because there can be no spoilers pertaining to this documentary, because there is nothing of merit stated that isn't completely obvious to anyone who knows anything about the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.

It is also worthy to note that, of the three reviews of this documentary posted prior to this, none mentioned a very curious portion of the program; that being the last specific contributing factor mentioned as the potential ""why"" of Columbine.

At the outset of the program, we are introduced to the members of the Threat Assessment Group, known as ""TAG."" The program's host, Bill Kurtis, states that TAG has been assembled in the ""...hope to prevent a massacre like Columbine from ever happening again. And TAG asked Investigative Reports to go along.""

During the program, it is stated repeatedly that the killers wished to leave behind a legacy, to be remembered, to have fame. The killers' names are mentioned countless times throughout the program. Not once was even one single name of any of the victims mentioned.

Investigative Reports: If you were HOPING to give the killers exactly what the members of ""TAG"" indicated they so clearly wanted, you have done a marvelous service for them.

And now for the painfully glaring irony: from 41:53 to 42:29, the narration, news footage, and subsequent dialogue of District Attorney Dave Thomas is as follows:

Bill Kurtis, narrating: ""And [PAUSE FOR EFFECT]... the media has lessons to learn as well.""

[from news footage following the incident] ""I'll take one or two more questions. That's all.""

District Attorney Dave Thomas: ""Each time we have a nationally publicized mass murder, we expect there to be another one within two weeks, if the coverage was big enough. And I can't tell you how many times I've been right on this, and how frustrating it is to have been, for twenty years, been asking the press to stop giving national coverage to mass murder, because it creates new ones.""

Being that Investigative Reports was produced by A&E Network, a channel owned by ""A&E Television Networks (currently branded as A+E Networks and formerly also known as AETN)...a U.S. media company that owns a group of television channels available via cable & satellite in the US and abroad"" (information from Wikipedia), one can only assume that this program was broadcast nationally, if not internationally.

Kudos to you, A&E, for completely missing Thomas' point.

Jump back to the beginning of the program and add further insult to insufferable injury: the very logo of the series is ironic--it's an image of crosshairs. And its host, making extremely affected hand gestures that I gather are intended indicate some sort of profundity, states:

""We'll follow a group of forensic scientists who will conduct what is called a psychiatric autopsy; interviewing as many people involved in the tragedy as possible; to provide some answers to why it happened [PAUSE FOR EFFECT] and maybe [PAUSE FOR EFFECT] prevent it in the future.""

Bill Kurtis, ""in this [PAUSE FOR EFFECT] SPECIAL EDITION of Investigative Reports,"" your friends and family must be very proud of you. I feel safe in stating that if they are, heaven forbid, they are the only ones in that very select minority.",1312243200,,3397,4.991150442477876
8104939,4,B000E37146,The video itself was excellent.  I was actually looking for something in the field of police response and tactics to school shootings i.e. Columbine.  It gave a great prosepctive from a profilers or psychologist view but not that of a Law Enforcement Tactical Response.,1179446400,3,269,5.090909090909091

8104941,5,B000E37146,I purchased this dvd to do a report for a course in my Masters program in Public Administration.  This was very informative and helped see why the shootings happened.  My classmates really appreciated this dvd it helped them understand how something like this could happen and help us be decision makers in government.,1167782400,4,318,4.981132075471698
