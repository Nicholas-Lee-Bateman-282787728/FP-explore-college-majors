2024167,5,B0001US67I,Great retelling of US hockey team victory over Russian national team in 1980 Olympic Games in Lake Placid. Kurt Russel is spot on as Coach Herb Brooks. Feel good movie. Makes you proud to be an American.,1522800000,,203,4.513513513513513
2024168,5,B0001US67I,"Excellent film. If you haven't watched it, watch it. Also one of my favorite Kurt Russell films. He portrays the quiet thoughtfulness and determination of a successful coach well. He also very much carried a 1970's vibe...which is perfect for a dad of two in 1980. For the most part, the makers of this film hired hockey players and taught them how to act instead of hiring actors and taught them how to skate. Teaching acting is the far easier and cheaper method, and the scenes on ice are incredibly well done. Also, they choreographed much of the actual TV footage from the 1980 Olympics, making it that much more realistic.",1522627200,,627,4.657657657657658

What's truly amazing is that you actually forget that you know the outcome. There is genuine suspense built up.

2024421,5,B0001US67I,"Miracle is a miracle of a sports movie, taking a relatively well-known event, where most viewers would already be aware of the outcome, and crafting a compelling, tense tale that enlightens and inspires while largely avoiding the schmaltz that can occur with 'inspired by a true story' biopics. The credit for this goes to some great acting performances, highlighted by Kurt Russell's outstanding turn as Coach Herb Brooks, and a very well written screenplay by Mike Rich (who also wrote Finding Forrester, The Rookie, and Radio). The filmmakers allow the story to breathe and build, cleverly entwining the real-life events of the time to allow us to feel the weight of the nation that started pressing down on this group of young men's shoulders. How at the height of the oil crisis, with the Russians invading Afghanistan (some ironies there) and many Americans losing hope about their place in the world and a positive future, a game of hockey captured the nation, providing not just one of the greatest upsets in sports history in terms of an underdog team overcoming a humungous favorite, but one of those moments when sports symbolises more than just box scores.

The one sad side story was that the coach died before the movie was released. I would add that I am not a particular hockey fan, or indeed a fan of any of the prominent sports, rather road racing, cars, motorcycles etc and sailing are more my style.

2024499,5,B0001US67I,"I was 9 years old in Feb. 1980. I am an only child and my Dad and best friend died suddenly when I was 31. I remember the USA v. Russia game and the Finland game on Sunday vividly; as that weekend is one of my favorite memories of time spent with him ever. I can see the joy on his face like it was yesterday as Eruzione scored the winning goal against Russia. He jumped up, picking me up in one swoop cheering at the top of his lungs. And I remember his calm smile and our hearts full of American pride as we watched - and sang along with the players singing our national anthem at the medal ceremony. At that time in the world, there was nothing like seeing our flag just a bit higher than the others. As Emily Dickinson wrote ""Success is tasted sweetest by those who n'er succeed...."" Or in this case - they were not EXPECTED to succeed.

I'm not going to review the movie here (although I feel Gavin did an AMAZING job and Kurt deserved an Oscar!) --as many have reviewed already. I won't even TRY to explain the sheer elation it was to watch the games - because I can't. You had to be alive and have a sense of the times to really understand. It truly is a ""you had to be there"" thing. Much like the last shot in the movie of Herb Brooks that read "".....He never saw it. He lived it"".
I will, however, say this: After losing my Dad, it became painfully evident that those perfect times are few and far between in life---and those times are little ""miracles"" of their own.
The USA v. Russia game actually started at 5pm Eastern Friday and ABC (smartly) made the decision to wait to air until 8pm. I have to admit, I miss the days where info was not so immediately accessible or we all would've known the outcome before being able to watch. Sadly, In the current world where everything is put out on blast in a nanosecond, we would've never had that experience.  ---Anytime I'm upset that I'm over 40, I think of that weekend. And for just a second - in that memory.... I am young, my Dad is by my side, and for one drop in time, I am grateful that these extremely talented people came together to recreate this experience for me. However, those of us who are lucky didn't have to see the movie------ we lived it.",1433376000,2,2216,4.199530516431925
2024500,5,B0001US67I,A family favorite. One of Kurt Russell's best,1433116800,,45,4.75
2024501,5,B0001US67I,"During the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC broadcast a 30-minute documentary piece on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. While I knew the story of how they beat the Soviets and won the Gold Medal (I had seen it live as a kid), I was expecting some clichd rhetoric about the team and what they had done, akin to films like ""Knute Rockne, All American"" (1940) and ""Rocky"" (1976). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was anything but. The coach of that team, Herbert Brooks, was no hackneyed clone of a Knute Rockne or a Vince Limbardo. Instead he was a tight-fisted uncompromising hockey general who distanced himself from his players, more like a Bobby Knight than a Knute. This was not someone with whom teammates would feel comfortable having a beer. Instead, his inspiration to the players came from the other direction, by exposing their weaknesses and in some cases using unfairness and resentment as anchors from which to get the best out of his players. I decided that ""Miracle"" might be worth a look, especially as a prelude to the US vs Canada in the gold medal round of 2010 Olympic Hockey.

Kurt Russell portrays Herbert Brooks as a lean and mean hockey coach who leaves sentimentality at the front door of the ice hockey rink. From the get-go he informs his players he's not there to be their friend. His goal is to let loose their highest playing potential coupled with the best conditioning among the Olympic hockey players at all costs. At times, he seems to be driving the players too hard well-beyond their comfort zones. Much of the story is the unconventional training techniques he uses to prepare the players for the 1980 Winter Olympics. According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey. His plan is to use the Soviets' techniques against them in the Olympics, which is not just about strategy but also about extreme discipline and an uncompromising tough sensibility akin to the military. One character points out that everything Brooks does has a purpose behind it.

The only short-coming in the script may be the portrayal of Brooks' wife who finds her relationship with her husband compromised, at least according to the film. I wondered if it played out in real life as in the film or if it was fabricated by the screenwriters. Too many sports movies have this sort of relationship with the wife acting as the balance between the obsessive coach and the needs of his family. She's been through this before. Why did she marry him in the first place? To be a successful account?

Certainly, most Americans know the outcome of the story, although the sequence of the game between the US and the Soviets is riveting and plays out about as well as the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed. However, the meat of the story is really about the relationship between Brooks and his players, and the coach's single-minded determination to create the best Olympic team possible. By putting a certain amount of anger and determination into their hearts and heads, Brooks brings out the best in them, much like a sergeant in boot camp. The speech before the Americans played the Soviets is one of the better scenes of its type, leaving behind the ""do it for the Gipper"" silliness that has become a sports clich. The only moment which was lacking in the film was the speech before the very final game when the US played Finland after the Soviets. In that speech, apparently Brooks told his team that if they didn't win, they would go to their graves regretting the missed opportunity. I would have liked to have seen Russell give that speech as well. Apparently Herb Brooks died before the principal shooting of this film had ended, and the film is dedicated to him. Just about as fitting a tribute as a coach could ask for.",1432944000,,3808,4.697604790419161

The hockey scenes are perfectly filmed, with insane effort going into making them match the original action on the ice from 1980. The emotion is real and palatable. You can almost feel yourself hating communism again just like the cold war was back in full swing.

It's just a great movie!

Most of the players (aside from Jim Craig's character) weren't actors. They were real hockey players at various levels. The director opted to teach hockey players how to act rather than to teach actors how to play hockey. It gives the film such a sense of realism that you become engulfed into the story.

Most of the film is lead up to the medal round game against the Soviets. But the game itself is represented so well you feel like you are at the arena. Despite having seen the game before and knowing the final score, I found myself hanging on every bit of action like I was watching a live hockey game.

2024588,5,B0001US67I,The miracle on ice is a powerful movie about how one team that nobody believed in went on to upset the best team in hockey at the time the Russians and eventually go on to win the Olympics. Herb Brooks played by Karl Madden in the movie is what I think one of the greatest acting role as a coach in all movies. Brooks came in as a college coach and knew that the Americans weren't as talented as the Russians individually but as a team could beat the USSR. He brings together a bunch of college kids from different universities together as one even though just a few months ago they absolutely hated each other. Brooks also puts the fire into these kids in different scenes giving them a sense of motivation and pride. One of the ending scenes brooks walks into the locker room before the game with USSR and delivers what I believe is one of the greatest pump up speeches in history. All around this movie is unbelievable and a must watch before you die,1417564800,,953,4.329608938547486

That year the United States won the gold medal. Again in 1980, Herb would get another chance to compete in the Olympics, this time as head coach. This coach had the sport down to a science; he was nonpareil, second to no one as to understanding the most intricate, nuanced aspects of the game and what it took to win. More details about this pedantic, didactic coach, individual players, and play-by-play action of the game is in the book ""The Boys of Winter"" by Wayne Coffey.",1409443200,,642,4.495726495726496

After hours of grueling suicides, over and over again, players falling down in exhaustion and stadium lights turned off, a player calls out his name, where he is from and who he plays for: The United States of America. Finally, the coach lets them go get rest. Prior to this, they all said their state team names and who they played for before they were chosen for the team. They were all individuals before. Now they took the step towards being a team and working together. Great sports movie!",1398384000,,617,4.469026548672566

Watching the story of Herb Brooks melding a disparate group of young hockey players, many of whom know and don't like each other into a cohesive unit focused on one, unifying goal, is not only entertaining, but more importantly, very instructive in how to, as Professor John Kotter of Harvard University, describes the leadership process: Clearly stating the vision/goal, aligning the members of the organization behind that vision/goal, and then motivating and inspiring them to achieve, makes this film a classic case study for any trainer/developer.

Kurt Russel makes an amazing Minnesotan (once you get use to that accent!  lol*) and the passion that the rest of the actors and actresses put into this true life story makes it as believable as if you were back in time when it actually happened.  I have a lump in my throat and glassy eyes even as I type this.  Americans are interesting people.  We are fat and lazy, preferring the easy over the tough for the most part, but don't get us going because history, as this movie re-enacts, proves that we are unstoppable when our strengths are awakened...
  I have read reviews that criticize this movie as 'predictable.'  Hello???  It is history that we all know already happened!!!  This is Hollywood tripe at its best.  This movie as as much about the big win as it is about the hearts, lives and sacrifices the players put into the win...

2024696,5,B0001US67I,"Based on a true story, ""Miracle"" portrays the unforgettable run of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to the gold medal at the Lake Placid Winter Games.  Kurt Russell plays Herb Brooks, the decisive, innovative coach who led the team to one of the biggest upsets in sports history and got the gold medal that eluded him in his own youth.

""Miracle"" does a great job with the historical backdrop surrounding the team, getting the look and feel of the 1979-1980 period just right.  It was a time of malaise much like our own, and the team's victory game the country a much-needed shot in the arm.

Even if like most of us you don't know the finer points of hockey and know how the movie will end, it is absorbing throughout.  ""Miracle"" shows how the team was assembled, and recalls how the sacrifices and intense training Brooks put the team through eventually produced a team that was much greater than the sum of its parts, beat the feared Soviet team, and won gold.  The movie even incorporates original ABC footage from Lake Placid, including the iconic call of Al Michaels at the end of the defeat of the Russians in the medal round.

Bonus features include Herb Brooks talking to the filmmakers and an ESPN discussion of this moving, inspiring film.",1392940800,5,1252,4.612612612612613

2024700,5,B0001US67I,"This movie is riddled with clichs.  In fact, it seems that so many sports film clichs found in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s were somehow inspired from this true story.  The thing is, so many of these clichs actually happened...very little was dramatized.  And while I'm not a fan of clichs and normally push a film down a notch in the ratings, this film makes up for it's many clichs by remaining true to its source material and for showing us the state America was in, enhancing the importance of this now-legendary game.  Personally, I could watch this film over and over again.  I've never had an opinion about Kurt Russell and I don't know that much about Herb Brooks, but I know enough about coaches to say that the former portrayed the latter very well.  It's sad that the real Herb Brooks died in a car accident during production.  But since a great coach only gets a team so far, I will now commend the decision to hire the players for their hockey skills rather than their acting abilities...I think everyone was able to do just fine because they were in their element out on that ice.  When they called themselves a ""team"" or a ""family"", I believed them.  This has often been called the greatest sports film of all time and I agree with this opinion...I would recommend this film to anyone.  Sure, the games were sometimes rushed, but the film could only be that long.  They're still enjoyable and it was great to have Ken Dryden and Al Michaels commentating as they had done back in 1980...and yes, Michaels's famous line is included perfectly.

I enjoyed seeing how they found the cast for the movie and how they choreographed it so the plays matched exactly with the original plays. How many people would have noticed if they were not exactly the same? Not many, but the producers felt it was important to be true to the story. I still tear up at the end when they show a picture of Herb Brooks. He left us too soon.

This is an amazing story, whether you want to watch something about the Olympics, hockey, the cold war, or all of the above. Kurt Russel is great. Patricia Clarkson is better. The hockey action is fun and feels real. The clashes, big and small, feel personal.

2024729,5,B0001US67I,"This movie is an entertaining recount of the ""Miracle"" 1980 U.S. Hockey team.  Quite simply, it's fantastic.  I was a senior in high school when this team won the gold and loved watching events that I vividly remembered.  Anyone who watched those Olympic Hockey games remembers Jim Craig searching for his father in the stands after winning the gold.  This movie recaptured that moment beautifully.  My children enjoyed it just as much as I did even though they  were far from being born yet.  The DVD extras are especially good - the producers explain how they first searched the country for young hockey players that resembled the 1980 team and tackled the problem of teaching them how to act second.  They also explain very well how they took great pains to recreate the pivotal hockey plays in the games.  Kurt Russell does a wonderful job portraying coach Herb Brooks.  Like a good book that you like to read again and again this is one of our go-to movies when there's nothing else on TV that holds our interest.

I missed the game when it actually happened in real life because I was not even born yet. It would have been great if they played ""We Are The Champions"" by ""Queen"" at the end of the movie instead of playing ""Dream On"" by ""Arrowsmith"" because when U.S.A. beated the Russians in real life, they did play ""We Are The Champions"" by ""Queen"" which is my only complaint about this movie.

2024770,5,B0001US67I,"I read somewhere that Americans consider this movie to be the greatest sports movie of all time. After reading it, I paused. I really have to think about this one. I can certainly understand how Americans love this movie; it's our Olympic hockey team composed of amateurs who wind up defeating an invincible Soviet team that defeated our own NHL All-Star team, and had a record of something like 42-1. So why not get caught up in a movie like this, especially since it's a true story? Well, I DID get caught up in it--just like I did when I was a 9 year old glued to the TV back in 1980. This movie is an accurate reflection of what happened in those months before the Olympics, with the fiery, mind-playing coach, Herb Brooks. Played by Kurt Russell, Brooks is determined to match the Soviets and eventually beat them at their own game, using a grueling conditioning program to ready his team, and holding accountable those who don't give 110%. Throughout the film, Brooks alienates his players through intimidation, and even his assistant coach can't believe what he's seeing with Brooks's tactics. However, a slow but sure process of gaining respect from his players takes place, as the players see the big picture. As the team continues to win, Brooks instills confidence in his players, especially on the eve of playing the Soviets. Kurt Russell does a magnificent job as Brooks, and is easily the star of this movie. I was also impressed with the good acting by the players. We hold the 1980 U.S. hockey team dear to our hearts, and there's an element of sacredness to the whole thing, because we had a team of top amateurs instead of the bloated roster of professional players that we use today. This movie reminds us that sports is a great institution in our country,  but was at its best during this period. The whole movie gives the feel of the Olympics and a message that miracles can and do happen.",1360454400,,1910,4.617647058823529
2024771,5,B0001US67I,I bought Miracle for my son in law who plays recreational ice hockey.  He loved every minute of it and it inspired him to do more research about the real miracle - the US winning gold at the Olympics.,1360022400,,200,4.128205128205129
2024772,5,B0001US67I,"I'm not a hockey fan.  I don't understand the intricacies of the sport, plus it's bloody hard watching it on TV.  I've only watched one hockey game, from start to finish, in my life:  The 1980 Olympic hockey game between a hodge-podge of college kids playing for USA versus the best hockey team in the history of the sport, the vaunted, intimidating Soviets.  On that Friday night in February, I watched with several friends the most historical--and riveting--upset in the history of sports.  It was literally a miracle (thank you, Al Michaels, for uttering possibly the most famous words in all of sports), we were all on our feet screaming ourselves hoarse, and yes, plenty of alcohol was consumed.  So it was with great interest I recently pulled up a chair to see the 2004 film MIRACLE, the story of the 1980 USA hockey team.  Again, riveting.

The actors portraying the players are all (to me) unknowns; but crikey, can they all skate and play hockey.  What holds this film together so well is Kurt Russell's performance as USA head coach Herb Brooks.  Brooks is a my-way-or-the-highway taskmaster who pulls no punches and runs a Spartan-type training camp--and he's not afraid to humiliate his players following an exhibition game.  At the outset, he tells his young charges he's not there to be a mentor or even a shoulder to lean on:  He's there to beat the Soviet Union.  He tells his players if they want a friendly ear, go speak to assistant coach Patrick (Noah Emmerich).  But he has their undivided attention and grudging respect, and once the team is assembled the story moves swiftly to the Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York, during the height of the Cold War, when post-Watergate America was, in President Carter's own words, in a ""malaise"".  It was the perfect time for some sort, any sort, of pick-me-up.

When watching the recreations of the various games as the US team advances, it was a stroke of genius to pull the actual audio announcing from the ABC broadcasts.  That lends a striking authenticity to what the viewer is watching.  And the climactic game between Team USA and the Soviets is grand seat-squirming fun that will have you clapping and cheering from your chair.  What's also very interesting is as the film ends, we get updates on what the various players are now doing in their lives (current as of 2004).  And Patricia Clarkson is also solid playing Brooks's (oft neglected, but always supporting) wife.  Kudos to director Gavin O'Connor for delivering such a feel-good story; with the possible exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudy/dp/B00004W221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudy</a>, MIRACLE may be the very best sports film in circulation.

The blu-ray transfer is solid.  While there is some film grain, this is still a definite improvement over the DVD.  The colors pop, particularly the blue uniforms of Team USA and the red uniforms of the Soviet team.  They look great against the white ice.

Parental Advisory: The movie was rated PG.  It has some hockey-related violence, including intense workouts.  There is some mild language.  Most parents would find little objectionable here for their children.  It is a Disney movie after all.

2024831,5,B0001US67I,"In 1980 I was 11 years old.  I still remember the media reporting that the U.S. knocked off the invincible Soviet hockey team in the Olympics.  At the time, I didn't know what the big deal was.  After all, I figured that the United States should dominate the Olympics in all sports.  Needless to say, I was a naive kid!

Since that time, I've gained an appreciation for the historic victory in Lake Placid NY.  As I didn't see the game itself, the present movie was a splendid way of ""replaying"" it (sort of?).

Beyond the game itself, the movie does a good job of taking the viewer back to those dark days in American history.  The U.S. was coming off of a humiliating retreat in Vietnam, Watergate, soaring energy prices and (worst of all) the Iranian hostage crisis.  Seeing this movie brought back a lot of unpleasant memories, for even as a kid I could sense that pessimism was in abundance in those days.

Kurt Russell gets his chance to play an iconic coach & he makes the most of it.  He has that certain coach's charisma that the best actors all have.  The film serves as an eye opening demonstration of how the players were chosen in an autocratic way.  Thankfully, ""Coach Herb"" knew what he was doing!

This is one of the most important sports movies ever made simply due to the fact that it tells the story of what was perhaps the SINGLE greatest upset in sports history.  Whether you like hockey or not (and I'm hoping you do!) this one is certainly worth a look.",1303776000,3,1476,4.4148148148148145
2024832,5,B0001US67I,"I remember watching the 1976 Winter Olympics that were held in Innsbruck, Austria.  The highlight for the U.S. was Dorothy Hamill winning the ladies' figure skating gold medal.  I remember watching everything, especially downhill skiing.  I really liked those winter games, so when the Lake Placid games started four years later, I was very interested in watching it.  Those were the games of Eric Heiden winning five speed skating gold medals, Robin Cousins, Ingemar Stenmark, and......of course......the Miracle On Ice.

The U.S. men's hockey team wasn't favored to win ANY medal, let alone the gold medal.  But they played extremely well in the tournament, then had to face the Soviet Union, the world's best team and a team that had just defeated the U.S. 10-3 in an exhibition game in New York's Madison Square Garden less than two weeks earlier.  Well, we all know what happened - a 4-3 victory for the U.S.  EVERYBODY was watching this game - THE WHOLE COUNTRY.  The 1980 winter games were tension-filled due to the political climate of the time period (the Cold War) and the fact that the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan two months earlier, not to mention the fact that President Jimmy Carter had already talked about boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics that were held in Moscow later that year.  Sporting events often are a way for people to take out their frustrations on things that bother them, and winning makes everyone feel pride and glory.  This game vs. the Soviets is THE prime example of this.  After defeating the heavily favored Soviet Union, the U.S. then defeated Finland 4-2 to win the gold medal two days later.

Miracle (2004) is a great re-telling of the Miracle On Ice.  Rated PG, it is 135 minutes long and stars Kurt Russell as coach Herb Brooks and many good actors who play the roles of the 20 or so players that made up the hockey team.  The acting overall is good.  The overall feel of the movie is key.  When I watch the movie, I really do feel like I'm re-living February 1980.  ABC Sportscaster Al Michaels does a play-by-play voiceover throughout.  The musical score by Mark Isham is good.  You'll also hear some songs from around that time period.  I especially like the use of (Don't Fear) The Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult.  This is a 2-DVD set that has over four hours of extras, including ""The Making Of Miracle"", audio commentary, a conversation between Kurt Russell and Herb Brooks, outtakes, a featurette about turning hockey players into actors called ""From Hockey To Hollywood: The Actors' Journey"", an ESPN Roundtable with Linda Cohn, Mike Eruzione, Buzz Schneider, Jim Craig, and Kurt Russell, and ""The Sound Of Miracle"" featurette.

This isn't Disney-fiction or Rocky-fiction where the screenwriters script a miracle. This is a true story about real people who work to the breaking point to bring out the best in each other and surprise everyone... including themselves.

He needed his team to work as a team so that different players will score the goal to confuse them.  He needed them to have one imaginary enemy to focus their efforts on, and He chose himself.

2024841,5,B0001US67I,"MIRACLE

There are two things that lead me to write this review, the most important being that this film was one of my mom's favorites. She passed away recently after 13 years of battling various types of cancer [no lie, multiple]. The second being that the winter Olympics just passed with the US doing very well in hockey, in this true story they went all the way and won the gold. When getting ready to write this I thought about various things, things I should say, should it be about the film and just that, or should I discuss my mama as well. The truth is I am not sure even still while typing this but it may serve as some kind of therapy, who knows. What I do know is that even if she was still around this is a very good film that shows what America is all about. In hockey, war, friendship, love, and life this is still the greatest country ever. From the actual hockey all the way to the acting the film is suburb in every way, and I mean that.

I am sure after all the years this film as been out you know the story, the story of the underdog. The story of the people who are not even looked at as worthy to be in there let alone win the thing. Yeah that is the story of the American Olympic Hockey Team from the 1980 Winter Games. The team was coached by Herb Brooks who was the coach at the University of Minnesota at the time, turns out this guy was a genius. He was counted out even before he got the job and once he did no one supported his decisions except maybe one or two people. Even still no one believed he could lead the US to victory especially over heavy favorites the Soviet team. Still as it would turn out he was the right man for the job, and his methods were excellent.

From the get go he wanted his team to be able to practice and come together longer than planned, so instead of a week long try out he had one day. Picked 26 guys who were all talented but maybe not the best over all in some cases, he wanted the best potential team players. Then he wilted it down to just 20 and off he went making his team of no name college guys [remember pros were not playing at the time in the Games] making them hate him so they wouldn't hate each other, which made them a team. Eventually that hate turned to respect for Brooks which made them into a family. It was that frame of mind that Herb wanted all along because it was no longer a team of individuals but one unit. It was that unit that would go on to give this country something it needed most off all in that time. What was that one thing, well for some it was hope, for others a good time, for others an escape, but one thing is for sure it was more than a hockey game.

Kurt Russell does a fantastic job of playing Herb Brooks and gets the man point blank, from his mannerisms to his voice and everything else. From what I can tell from the excellent special features he spent a lot of time with Herb and basically became him on the set. Same thing for all of the players on the team, they actually became the people they were portraying. Honestly Kurt could have won some awards for this because it truly is a great film and he did a great job. The surprising thing about this film is how good the kids are that played the players. Finding people that can act and play hockey is an amazing task, I mean my brother fits that to a t but finding a whole team is amazing. Also Patricia Clarkson does a great job as Herb's wife for the time that she is on screen, as does every one in the film.

Gavin O'Connor did a great job directing this film and making as true as possible and bringing this story back to life. You could tell when watching the behind the scenes he really did enjoy making this film. Writer Eric Guggenheim as well did an excellent job turning this true life sensation into a screenplay; I wish he would do more films. Also DP Dan Stoloff did a marvelous job, I love the way they filmed the hockey. This movie truly is a great film and not only should be watched but should be owned. I recommend buying this film as soon as possible because during these times it is could to see something like this. There are some excellent special features from behind the scenes, to the true story, to an excellent audio commentary.

This is not the grand review that I wanted to write but I just can't seem to get the words to come out. As I type and type after watching this movie I can't help but think about my mother, I was hoping to not only honor this film but to honor her as well. To be honest I am not even sure if I should post this or not, I guess I did if you are reading this. This movie is not only a true story but it showcases the best this country has to offer, its people. I get goose bumps when the legendary line ""do you believe in miracles"" is said, it is also the actual audio from that game. So here's to the greatest person I have ever had the pleasure and honor of knowing. The strongest person to have ever impacted my life, who was actually a hockey mom, we all miss and love you.

2024850,4,B0001US67I,"The Cold War, a 40-year pi$$ing contest between the world's capitalist and socialist superpowers came to an end in 1991 with more of a peep than a bang. And be thankful for that. We flushed money down the toilet building up a nuclear arms race to epic fail proportions. And then came the gas shortages, unemployment, the South American Contra affair, hostages in Iran, Soviets in Afghanistan, and everybody still reeling from Watergate and Vietnam, the world was just having a bad hair day (but compared to the last 3 years I'd say it was a walk in the park).

Then the Olympics rode into a little upstate New York town called Lake Placid, and something earth shattering happened. No, it wasn't Armageddon. It was a hockey game. And the good guys won! USA! USA! USA! And the NHL is barely a blip on the American pro sports radar compared to the NFL, NBA, MLB- hell even the PGA gets better airtime! But that's not the point, 20 collegiate nobodies managed to convince an entire country that we can do anything... provided that we had a coach to play mind games and beat our a$$es into the ground 95% of the time.

Herb Brooks was a unique individual. This grandfatherly man who knew the Latin scientific names of shrubbery was a terror on the college hockey circuit. He was also its best coach. Reading like a Greek tragedy, this Minnesotan tempest in a whirlpool bath was the last man cut from the gold medal winning 1960 Olympic hockey team. In short Herbie had a sick bone to pick with USA Hockey. Meanwhile behind the Iron Curtain, the USSR having picked itself up from the ruins of WW II, the mighty Red Sports Machine produced hockey teams that would sweep every Olympic gold medal and nearly every world title from 1964 on. Herb Brooks got his most ardent wish and got a shift for USA Hockey profiling all the ""right"" players over the ""good"" ones to challenge the Soviets.

Now I was a bit leery when I saw the Disney logo plastered all over the trailer. The last thing we needed was some Mickey-Mouse-tooth-rotting-happy-go-lucky-afterschool-special-behind-the-scenes-REHASH of 1980 USA hockey. I also wasn't confident of Kurt Russell's (he's from Massachusetts- OH THE IRONY!) ability to portray Brooks, especially since he died after the completion of principal photography. Then I saw two interesting things: 1) PG-13 rating- OOH! Adult Disney! 2) A TRUCKLOAD of hotties! Disney got the 16-25 female range in their crease (because if you saw the original team pic, the real guys weren't so... photogenic). But it was kismet for angry pucknuts since the NHL 2004-'05 lockout left a bad taste in their mouths, so they got themselves a gold medal cookie to nibble on for Miracle's 2/6/04 premier. And it was a success.

I can't give this flick 5 stars because I felt (along with other angry fangirls- NOT PUCKBUNNIES!) that Miracle contained false advertising. All those wonderful scenes with the team you see in the trailer and extras were left to rot on the cutting room floor. I know the story is ESSENTIALLY about Herb Brooks, but it took 20 special guys to make this miracle happen. With the exception of Eddie Cahill (who is a dead-ringer for a twenty-something Jimmy Craig who was a good looking man... from the right angles) all those guys were hockey players (and Billy Schneider IS Buzzy's son). So Disney if you're going to double dip with this Blu-Ray crapola, you'd better get together with Gavin O'Connor for surgery and splice those scenes back in! I'd like to know a little more about Rizzo, Mac, Jimmy, O.C., Bah, Buzzy, Silky, Rammer, Jannie, Coxie, and Magic, because their stories are worth the $22 you want to steal from me. Besides, the fanfics are lacking.",1249084800,,3687,4.75625

Blu-ray bonus extras include outtakes, a making-of featurette, audio commentary by O'Connor, as well as featurettes on the film's sound and the actors' learning hockey basics.",1247356800,,829,5.531746031746032
2024852,5,B0001US67I,"1979-1980...the United States of America was in a difficult position from in the late 70's with water shortages, oil shortages (which led to long lines at the gas pump since gas stations didn't have enough gas), Jimmy Carter vs. Ronald Reagan and the Iran hostage crisis.  As 1980 came, there was one major highlight in sports history for the United States that won the hearts of millions and that was the underdog United States men's hockey team defeating the ""unbeatable"" Soviet team in the medal round.  That moment in time sports announcer Al Michaels said ""Do you believe in miracles?"" and from that win, the game was dubbed a ""miracle"".

In 2004, Walt Disney Pictures and director Gavin O'Connor (""Tumbleweeds"" and ""Pride and Glory""), writer Eric Guggenheim, actor Kurt Russell (""Stargate"", ""Backdraft"", ""The Thing"", and ""Escape from New York""), composer Mark Isham (""Crash"", ""Next"", ""Invincible"" and ""Pride and Glory""), cinematographer Dan Stoloff ""Tumbleweeds"", ""The Vagina Monologues"" and ""The Prince"") came together to recreate this moment of time and adapt it into a film.

Working with the coach of the 1980 United States Olympic ice hockey team, Herb Brooks (who passed away before the film was completed) and several of the players from the team, the filmmakers and the athletes and the talent would come together and make a film that would be true to how the original people were but to have a film that was as authentic and real, so that meant having actors who can play hockey and even have to participate in grueling and challenging moments in order to understand how strict the coach was on the players and how they needed to prepare for the Olympics.

""MIRACLE"" documents the challenges that the players had to go from day one up to the actual 1980's Olympic games but also challenges some of the players and the coach had to face off the ice.

The film would earn its distinction as one of the most accurate looking sports films ever and also take home ""Best Sports Movie"" at the ESPY Awards in 2004.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""MIRACLE"" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1.  The picture quality does feature grain throughout but you can see the quality from Kurt Russell's skin pores, detail on the clothing.  Low light scenes look great with no digital compression artifacts and no dust or scratches.  Skin detail can be seen quite well during the dark as well.

Director Gavin O'Connor and Director of Photography Daniel Stoloff did a great job in capturing the look and feel of that time.  From hair styles, clothing, closeups but most of all capturing all the action on the ice.

As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  Director Gavin O'Connor was very much involved with the audio process and making sure that the sounds of hockey, from the puck hitting a post, body clashing on the barriers, pucks being hit, skates on the ice were captured.  Sounds of various players from different countries communicating to each other in their own language was covered.  The cheers from the audience would come alive through the audio.

With that being said, the audio is front channel heavy.  Audio is quite clear and the music by Mark Isham comes alive as well.  But I was no immersed in sound as I was hoping to be.  Rear surrounds were used sparingly but I suppose I was expecting a full round of audience cheering all around me but that didn't happen.  Everything seemed as if it was all front channel driven.  I don't recall any low frequency sounds utilizing the subwoofer as well.

But overall, dialogue is clear and understandable.  Music is clear and heard quite well.  But I wish the audio was more immersive and utilized the rear audio channels even more.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

MIRACLE comes with a good number of special features.  Included are:

  * Audio Commentary by Director Gavin O'Connor, Director of Photography Dan Stoloff and Editor John Gilroy -
  * The Making of Miracle - (17:52) Behind the scenes on the making of ""MIRACLE"".  How Director Gavin O'Connor wanted authenticity and the talent needing to go through training camp and having to take the physical hits, having to go through similar grueling conditioning that  Coach Herb Brooks put the 1980 Olympic Men's Ice Hockey team through.  Having to bring Al Michaels to re-record certain play-by-play calls and much more.  Capturing the game from that time period and making things look authentic nearly 25 years later.
  * From Hockey to Hollywood:  The Actor's Journeys - (27:31) An interesting interview as we get some of the original team members with the actors who are portraying them.  The actors talk about their roles and trying to make sure that they were like the actual actors.  Original athletes of the 1980 team talking about how the talent were almost like spitting image of them during that time.
  * The Sound of Miracle - (10:24) As the Director Gavin O'Connor wanted to create authenticity of the game.  It was important to get the sounds of the game incorporated in the film.  This featurette shows us how that was done.
  * Miracle ESPN Roundtable with Linda Cohn - (41:08) Linda Cohn interviews actor Kurt Russell and 1980 United States Olympic ice hockey team members Mike Eruzione, Buzz Schneider and Jim Craig.  From discussions of the comparison of the film and what happened in real life and remembering Coach Herb Brooks and what Kurt Russell did to play the role of the coach.
  * First Impressions: Herb Brooks with Kurt Russell and the Filmmakers - (21:13) Herb Brooks passed away before the film was completed but the filmmakers had footage of when they met with Herb Brooks and getting to know the man.  Brooks talked about his emotions of being part of the 1960 US Olympic Men's Ice Hockey team but then getting cut before the day of the Olympics and the emotions he head then and also as a coach.
  * Outtakes - (4:52) - The bloopers and outtakes from the film.

The special features are all featured in 480i Standard definition and with English 2.0 Dolby Digital audio.  Subtitles for the special features are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I was younger, I can easily remember watching the 1980's US Men's Olympic Hockey Team beating the Soviets and watching as many of the games before the medal rounds and literally be entranced by the moment.

After watching ""MIRACLE"", I was amazed by how much went into the creation of this film in order to capture the authentic feel of the game but everything that went on behind-the-scenes such as the players calling themselves only by their characters names, going through extensive hockey training and preparing them for actual grueling scenes of conditioning (especially having to take part in actual ""Herbies"" that the 1980 United States Olympic ice hockey team had to go through), having to endure actual hockey body-to-body hits and much more.

Kurt Russell also determined to capture Coach Herb Brooks in his mannerisms and even going so far in reality not introducing himself to the talents and keeping his distance in order to capture Brooks attitude towards his players.

Sports films are typically, make or break.  People know when actors are playing sports films because scenes are not realistic.  But what made this film work so well was the preparation that Director Gavin O'Connor demanded and got from his crew and talent in capturing authenticity.  From making hockey look like hockey, the sounds are captured authentically for the film and more.

As for the Blu-ray, picture quality is good and definitely much better than its DVD counterpart.  Audio is clear and understandable but I wish that the rear surrounds were utilized much more, especially to make the audio of the crowds much more immersive and make you feel that you were there.  The special features were all informative and fun to watch.

But for those who own the original 2-disc DVD, there's not much of anything extra on this Blu-ray disc in terms of features but you do get the 1080p High Definition transfer which looks great and a DTS-HD Master Audio track.  So, if you really enjoyed the film, you'll enjoy the High Definition transfer on Blu-ray.

Whether or not you enjoy hockey, ""MIRACLE"" is about adversity, team work, rising from the bottom to the top and an awesome and nostalgic return to that moment in time to show us that ""miracles do happen"".

Do you believe in miracles?  ""MIRACLE"" is highly recommended!",1245110400,8,8577,4.84065934065934

2024855,5,B0001US67I,"""Miracle"" is much more that just a true account of an improbable and what should have been a virtually impossible - upset gold medal victory - in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. Like a perfect storm the chronicles of Herb Brooks (an intriguing and remarkable man) and the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team is more than just a ""story"". At a time when the Rissian threat was real and in the midst of the cold war, a bunch of amatuer, rag tag - but talented - US ""kids"" from college - beat the unbeatable and the ""professional"" Red Army / USSR Hockey team. It shouldn't have happenned - but coach Brooks conviced his inferior but hard working kids - that they COULD. The casting is as good as the movie - all players / actors in the movie that were cast played hockey at some level. Being from Boston I could relate to the local players and their families who sacrificed so much for the opportunity to play on this team. Kurt Russell is excellent as Coach Brooks. My favorite scene is when Mike Eruzione (the team captain) decides to respond to coach Brooks while the team is being taught ""a lesson."" The team comes together and Brook's plan as coach does too. You don't have to love hockey to enjoy this movie - but any kid that ever played at any age or at any level MUST see this movie. It is as inspiring as any movie you will ever see!",1242086400,,1340,4.2795275590551185
2024856,4,B0001US67I,"This was a pretty nice movie overall. I appreciated the realistic hockey scenes and the inspiring true-life story of an amazing underdog sports team pulling off the ""miracle."" That, of course, was the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal and along the way becoming the first team in 20 years to defeat the Soviets.

The story also is about Herb Brooks, the coach of the team. Everything in here centers around him. Kurt Russell does a nice job playing him, although I don't understand the Polish accent Russell used. Why would Brooks have a Polish accent?

Over the years, sports movies - as in other genres - are becoming more and more realistic. This was about as good as it gets in that regard. A number of the actors are players, meaning they know how to skate. A documentary with the DVD shows the great lengths they went to in filming this in order make the action look realistic. It's not fake; these guys know how to play the game and the camera-work, along with the sound, is outstanding.

The only part of the film that was totally unnecessary was the typical cheap shots against Republican Presidents while airing an inspirational speech by Democrat Jimmy Carter. Even if a hockey film, Disney Liberals just have to be in the viewers face with political bias. Too bad because otherwise it's a good sports movie that even non-hockey fans should enjoy.",1237507200,,1386,4.695473251028806

2024859,5,B0001US67I,"I am not a sports fan. Period. I'll watch the occasional few minutes of Michael Jordan in a tense playoff or a fantastically close Super Bowl on occasion, but beyond that, I have no interest.

  I do find  few movies about the fanatics who drives themselves to excel interesting or the fanatics who drive people to excel, to go far beyond what they themselves thought possible.

  That's what ""Miracle"" is all about, a coach named Herb Brooks who drove a group of mostly collegiate hocky players to fuse into an Olympics winning team, trumping the Soviets, who had won four consecutive championships.

  Kurt Russell plays Herb Brooks. What we see is a narrow, driven man who has only one goal: to produce an Olympics winning hockey team through his coaching. And Russell conveys that image beautifully, leaving us with an impressiona of a guy we probably wouldn't want to spend any time with (and, likewise, we would be of no interest to him) who ignored his family and browbeat 20 some kids into submission until they became a functioning team.

  It's a great movie about a coach. The players, as they were in the real incident, were submerged to the coach's will and ego. The hockey scenes are exciting. I don't know enough about hockey to comment on their authenticity and, frankly, I don't care.

  In the end, it is the story of a driven, selfish man demanding that his recruits obey his every order and become, to a large extent, automatons until they fuse into a single whole, a team. Look closely and you will see the techniques of every successful army since the beginning of time: slavish obediance while preserving the capability to make individual decisions. It worked for Alexander the Great, Julius Ceasar, George Patton and Herb Brooks, when he applied it to hockey.

  A lot of the film centers on rah-rah American patriotism which needed a boost after feckless Presidency of Jimmy Carter who cancelled American participation in the 1980 Summer Olympics to ""protest"" the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It is a nice feeling to see the United States portrayed positively in a Hollywood movie, for a change.

  Overall, ""Miracle"" is an entertaining movie about an eccentric coach, the team he built and the results they acheived. Best of all, it's a true story.

I recently bought the video of the original game...which I can remember seeing like it was yesterday.  We were shocked to find that the sound track from the original broadcast was used 100% in the movie, not an easy trick because the action then had to match what the announcers had said. This makes for a surprisingly real reproduction.  And the Russian coach in the movie is  dead ringer for the real guy who has to be seen to be appreciated.",1212537600,,603,4.2631578947368425

2024865,4,B0001US67I,"The challenges were formidable: A Soviet hockey team that won by intimidation. After all, they hadn't been beaten in 15 years. But it could be done. Coach Brooks kept telling his 19 year-old players to play their game and to take the fight to the Russians. They had to WANT it. In some games, the players had given less than 100%, and coach Brooks would not stand for it.

But first things first. The team had to become a cohesive unit. And, even if it were never to become the best team in the world, it had to become the best conditioned team in the world. This took time. Finally, even if they were not better than the Russians overall, they HAD to be the better team that particular night.

The politics at the time was clear. President Carter had just given his malaise speech. The US was humiliated by Ayatollah Khomeini. A sign posted at the US-Soviet hockey game at Lake Placid said: ""Get the puck out of Afghanistan!""

And so the stage was set for the miracle. The Soviet coach was staring with unbelief--like a fish out of water. A spell of delirium captured the US. Who could forget?",1208044800,4,1094,4.432835820895522
2024866,5,B0001US67I,"I grew up in Texas in the 60s. It's an understatement to say that hockey was a sport I had little knowledge of, and even less interest in.

That changed very dramatically in 1980. For those of you too young to remember the cold war, it's probably hard to understand the national significance attached to sporting and cultural events that pitted the US vs. the Soviet Union: Van Cliburn winning the Tchaikovsky piano competition in Moscow in 1958; Bobby Fischer defeating Boris Spassky for the world chess championship in 1972; the Soviet basketball team (in an extremely controversial game) ending the US's unbeaten streak in the Olympics that same year; and the Miracle on Ice depicted in this movie. In each case, millions of Americans who had little interest in classical music or chess or basketball or hockey suddenly found themselves very interested indeed. Whether or not these events should have been viewed as Cold War battles, it's simply the case that they were.

Having said that, how well does ""Miracle"" recall the events? I think it does so brilliantly, from the casting to the cinematography to the direction -- all of it. It's not hard to believe you're back in 1980.

Final note: next to hearing the famed Al Michaels line ""Do you believe in miracles? Yes!"", my favorite scene was a few seconds earlier. As the clock wound down with the US team protecting its lead, we see the coach's wife in the stands, head bowed and gloved hands rubbing together nervously, unable to watch. One of many, many great vignettes in this great movie.",1203206400,4,1549,4.794007490636704

The audience gets to see the process of forming such a team from the selection of the coach, to the selection of the players, to the grueling schedule of practice, through several defeats, to eventual success.

'Miracle' is a completely successful, realistic depiction of a remarkable event in American sports history.  Herb Brooks and a variety of the members of the real 1980 US hockey team signed on as advisors with Brooks suffering an untimely death during the production.  The contribution of these people enables the goals, action, story, and acting, to be dead-on accurate in its presentation of the events as they took place during the 1980 games.  Kurt Russell shines brightly in his role as the coach of this team; from the Minnesota accent, to the coaching style, Russell's performance is as life-like as acting gets.  All the hockey players are remarkable in their performances, but special attention should be paid to Billy Schneider, the son of Buzz Schneider, who portrays his father in this film, Patrick O'Brien Demsey who perfectly plays the role Mike Eruzione, and Mike Mantenuto, the former UMaine player, who portrays Jack O'Callahan.

While there are movies which are much more complex, much deeper, and much more artistically valuable, 'Miracle,' aims to be a simple, but accurate, depiction of this remarkable event in the history of the Cold War. Director Gavin O'Connor succeeds admirably in meeting and surpassing these modest goals.

This movie depicts plays and events SOOO accurately you could have matched movie to documentary on tv's side by side and not seen much difference even where the players were on the ice!
The team for the movie was made up of real hockey players from the NHL, Canadian and Russian hockey teams.. only a couple were real actors, but ALL did superb in their portrayal of the player he was acting out.

I wasn't aware of the larger implications, of the events in history that had been transpiring nor even the meaning of the Olympic games.  I knew the Russians to be the bad guys, that was about it.  Obviously I somehow knew there was something larger at stake because even my mother was surprised at how nuts we went when they won.

I hesitated to watch this film for a long time due, sadly, to the Disney attached to the film.  I was afraid of it being given a gloss.  Happily, this was not the case, as many reviewers here will attest to its accuracy and attention to detail.

The opening segue giving a quick and poignant synopsis of events that had been transpiring throughout that decade, with a few significant moments captured at various points throughout the film, grounds it in the history of which I was, at twelve years old, unaware.

Kurt Russell is incredible as the coach but it is the seasoned hockey players who were chosen to act in the film that really give this film its feel.  Relive that moment or experience it for the first time, I highly recommend this film, especially in a day and age where the idea of sports has dissipated into big business.

Yes it's overly sentimental and just oozing with saccharine but deep down inside I think that's how most of us want to remember this game anyway. U.S.A. versus Russia, doesn't get any better than that!",1177545600,2,761,4.9453125
2024878,5,B0001US67I,"It is easy to summarize the plot behind this movie.  It is about the 1980 U.S. hockey team that went all the way to gold in the Olympics at Lake Placid.  What is harder to summarize is the era and feelings of the United States at that time, and just what a kick in the behind this game was for the U.S.

1980 was a very bad time.  Inflation was horrible.  We recently left Viet Nam, failing to accomplish whatever mission we had.  Students kidnapped Americans from the embassy in Teheran.  We suffered from a president who was tied to a politically motivated hotel break-in and from a president who was unable to effectively deal with politics in Washington, D.C.; then came the 1980 Olympic hockey team.

The hockey team of the Soviet Union was the dominant team for 20 years.  They were favored to win the 1980 Olympics.  The U.S. team might have a shot for bronze, if we were lucky.  Instead, the U.S. team kept beating teams that ""everyone"" expected to beat the U.S.  Americans began holding their breath as the team played each new opponent, and won.  It was amazing.  The gold medal game against Finland was almost an anti-climax after the game against the Soviet Union.  While Coach Brooks was there to play hockey and go all the way, the biggest hurdle was going to be the tough, professional Soviet team.

This movie captures it all; the feeling of the era, details of the era, the thrill of each team victory, and Coach Brook's refusal to celebrate any victory until the truly important one.  I was amazed at Kurt Russell's performance.  He is compelling as Coach Brooks.  Brooks is obsessed in his drive to make his team the best, and he skillfully transmits that obsession to his players.  Kurt Russell was perfect for the role of Brooks, and it is one of his finest moments in a movie.

This movie is perfect for most members of the family, and may well serve as an inspiration for some family members.  Some younger members of the family may be distressed by the violence of hockey, which is well replicated in this movie.  You may not want to be eating while watching some portions of the movie.

The hockey games are filmed more realistic than in anyother movie that involved hockey that I've seen. I recommend this to anyone that is a huge fan of hockey.

2024882,5,B0001US67I,"This is a 2 CD set that I found it at Target cheap.  CD1 is the movie itself and CD2 is chock full of a buncha extras like the story of the ""actors"" playing the players.  I didn't think of this before, but it's not like you can hire actors to pretend they can skate and play hockey.  The director wanted the movie to be as realistic as possible, so he had to hire a bunch of hockey players with the acting gene.

I'm not going to bother reviewing the movie because if you're even reading the reviews on this site, then you already know just how astonishgly good it is.  But I will say this much about it.  I can't believe that Disney put out such a high quality product.  That said, there are a lot of other extras on the CD that you'd probably enjoy assuming you're into the 1980 Olympics Hockey Team.  I just wish I could find a decent version of the game itself, but the only copies I've found are like $100 bucks on VHS.

Where it concerns history, the 1980 hockey game itself should already be on DVD.  It shouldn't be available only from sellers on eBay pushing a crappy, poor quality, beat up VHS tape.  But I don't expect the DVD will ever become a reality because the publisher of the DVD would have to seek the permission of the USOC and otherwise jump through ABC's copyright hoops in order to make it happen.

This inavailablity is a prime example of copyright clusterf*ck to the detriment of the culture.  I know I'm not the only guy in the world who wants this game on DVD.  But thanks to the morons in Congre$$ and their moneyed corporate taskmasters who paid them off to pass draconian copyright laws, this game will most likely deteriorate on the celluloid in its tin in a vault somewhere.  Just like all the other vintage events shot on celluloid that are languishing because copyright laws have locked down permanently what has permission to be transferred to DVD versus not.

2024883,5,B0001US67I,"I had never had any interest in the Olympics, Summer or Winter, until I was a 13-year old kid who was laid-up with the flu in 1980 and watched the Winter Olympics because they were the only alternative to soap operas during the day. As a 40-year old, I now have a great appreciation for history and am glad that I developed enough interest in the Olympics that I watched and witnessed this historic moment.

The film does a fantastic job of recreating the social climate of the late '70's and early '80's: the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, the disco craze, oil embargos, and unrest in the Middle East (i.e. the Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis). President Carter gave his infamous ""Crisis of Confidence,"" a.k.a. 'malaise,' speech in which he pointed the finger at the American public while doing nothing to provide inspiring or effective leadership. He was right, though: America was having a crisis of confidence. We needed a morale boost.

And along came the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team. It was a team of true amateurs unlike the Soviet team that had won the gold medal in the previous four Olympics. The Soviets were so well-funded by their government that they were able to focus entirely on their hockey game and were so good that they even beat a team of NHL all-stars. And yet our amateurs beat our (at that time) arch-enemy's hockey juggernaut and gave the entire country a confidence and morale boost. The fact that they won the gold medal by beating Finland was just icing on the cake; all that really mattered was that they had beaten the Soviets.

It's great to get the background behind the players and their coach, Herb Brooks, in this movie. The movie contains many sports cliches: the diverse group of players who need to learn to function as a team, the hard-nosed coach who teaches them, and the underdog comes out on top cliches are all here. None of that matters, though, because it was all true. If you were alive and old enough to remember this time, then this movie will warm your heart as much as the team's victory did in 1980. If you weren't alive or old enough to remember, then watch and see what Americans did (and still can do) when we set our minds on achieving a goal even as everything around us seems to be falling apart. Sports truly can be a metaphor for life, so let's all learn a lesson from this team.",1160697600,4,2353,4.557919621749409

That said, I'm old enough that I remember the Olympic games where ""Miracle"" occurred.  I remember the thrill, the excitement, the way that it brought folks in our community together in a very special way.  It was a very moving event.

This movie does justice to those memories.  Kurt Russell is wonderful as the coach.  And I was amazed to watch the 'special/bonus features' on the DVD afterwards, and learn that almost all of the main actors were actually NOT actors to begin with, but actual hockey players who were recruited based upon their hockey skills, how much they resembled the Olympic players they were representing, and LASTLY their 'acting skills'.  And knowing Mike Eruzioni, I can vouch for how closely the actor who represented HIM speaks/looks/acts like Mike!

My whole family (none of us hockey fans) loved this movie.

2024886,5,B0001US67I,"I will give this much of a preface: I don't watch many movies in general. However, considering that this movie was based on actual events from the 1980 Miracle On Ice Men's Hockey Teams, I figured that this had to be better than the 1981 ""Miracle On Ice"" with Karl Malden and Steve Guttenberg. My assumptions were proven right!

The production staff in this film put months of R+D into this movie. (Watch the supplemental DVD about the making of the movie. That says it all right there.) I was thoroughly impressed with how they turned actual hockey players into actors for this movie. I was also impressed with how they kept the focus on Herb Brooks' determination to beat the Soviet Union. (BTW, for those of you reviewers out there who say that the Soviets ""threw"" the game to ease tensions between us and them, check your facts. Mike Eruzione, the team captain, said in an interview on XM 204's Home Ice that those same Russians have come back to him years later and said that they still can't believe they lost the game back in Lake Placid.)

Here's another sidenote: when Home Ice did a 26th anniversary show dedicated to the American triumph over the Soviets, they brought back players like Ken Morrow and Neal Broten -- to name a few. They made it perfectly clear that both movies that were based on their team really made Herb Brooks out to be much softer than he really was. Remember that scene where he had them skate back and forth on the ice after a game against Norway, even when the lights were turned out? That lasted an hour. According to them, he was an extremely tough coach.

Granted, there are some who say that there should have been some more off-ice drama. I say, ""Not at all"". Whatever was off-ice in the movie perfectly complemented the storyline.

Here's my final sidenote: if it wasn't for Herb Brooks, US Hockey would not be where it is today. The 2006 NHL Entry Draft is proof of this. Ten Americans were picked in the first round, and that had never happened before.

It's just a shame that Herb Brooks didn't live to see the finished product from this movie.",1152403200,2,2090,4.518518518518518

2024888,5,B0001US67I,"Although it may have been trendy after the fact to play down the impact and achievements of the 1980 ""Miracle on Ice"" Hockey Team, an honest appraisal of that momentous and inspirational event will give you an understanding of how important it was to the American psyche at the time.  (As to those ""reviewers"" who claim the Soviets threw the game?  Utter pathetic nonsense.  The venom and hatred spewed forth by some of these ""reviewers"" is absolutely unreal and beyond my comprehension. Maybe it does speak volumes as to how good the movie really is.)

The movie opens with a montage of film clips from the 1970's.  Don't just read the opening credits.  Watch and listen.  By the time the movie itself actually begins, you can feel the funk this nation was in at the close of the decade.  Therein lies the importance of that ""hockey game"".  The economy was stagnant.  The Soviet Union was ascendant.  The U.S., post-Watergate and post-Vietnam, was adrift and lacking in confidence.  Along come a bunch of college kids, bringing down the Soviet hockey ogre that had dominated international hockey for 20 years, and was considered to be unbeatable.

Kurt Russell nails Herb Brooks, possibly Russell's best acting performance ever.  Unlike a lot of his earlier movies, throughout Miracle, although you know it is ""Kurt Russell"" playing Brooks, you do not see Kurt Russell.  You ""see"" Herb Brooks.  While some seem to react negatively to the Herb Brooks character, he coached at a time when a coach was expected to push his kids to the limit in order to make them achieve.  In today's more ""sensitive"" times, maybe we could not have a Herb Brooks?

But the kids stole the movie.  The overwhelming majority of them were hockey players first, with little or no acting experience, and they were wonderful (including one kid whose father actually played on the 1980 team).  Michael Mantenuto as Jack O'Callahan and Eddie Cahill (some acting experience) as goalie Jim Craig, nearly steal the movie.

This country probably needed to chant ""USA!  USA!"" a few times at the end of the 1970's, and the ""Miracle on Ice"" team let us do it.  So enjoy the movie, and the anticipation of one of the most famous endings in sports (""You've got ten seconds . . . . ""), as the end of the game against the Soviets draws to and end ("". . . . the count down going on right now . . . .""), and Al Michaels makes the final call of the game ("". . . .Morrow up to Silk . . . ""), a call that would live in sports lore ("". . . five seconds left in the game . . . ""), and hopefully bring a tear to your eye every time you hear it ("". . . Do You Believe in Miracles!!?"").

2024896,5,B0001US67I,"As someone who has watched the Winter Olympics for twenty years and has been watching sports in general for perhaps a little bit longer than that, it would have been difficult to have not heard about the United States Olympic Hockey Team from 1980. You know, the one that shockingly beat the dominant Soviet team, a Soviet team so strong it was beating the NHL All Stars in exhibition games. I knew this, but I didn't really understand. ""Miracle"" is the story of the 1980 team and follows the team from the formation to the conclusion at the Lake Placid Olympics.

We open with coach Herb Brooks (a nearly unrecognizable Kurt Russell) talking to a group of me, probably the US Olympic Committee about his vision for the squad and how he would like to form the team. He doesn't want to pick the best players, he wants to pick the best team. He knows this is the only way to have a chance against the Soviets who work so well as a team against the All Star Teams which are made up of individuals. Making the players into a team will be a challenge, one which is suggested throughout the movie as Coach Brooks asks the players their name and what team they play for and the players give their names and then their college (University of Minnesota, Boston College, University of Wisconsin, etc). It is easy to tell what answer Brooks is going for and not going and it is a bit later in the film that Brooks gets the answer he wants and that the viewer knows is a key turning point.

One would think that knowing exactly how the movie has to end would rob ""Miracle"" of dramatic tension. Somehow the director is able to make the viewer doubt that this team really is good enough to win in the Olympics at all, let alone to face the mighty Soviet squad which had won the previous four Gold medals for Hockey. Even when we get to the Gold Medal match is the ending in doubt. The US may have won their previous games, but these are the mighty Soviets. So much credit has to go to the filmmakers, the actors, the director, and the editor for cutting this film together in such a way that even knowing the ending does not lessen the impact of the ending, the emotion of the ending.

It is clear that I like this movie. It is a ""feel good"" movie in the best sense of the phrase because it isn't sappy and sweet, but a hard played game that brought out the best in the players and the underdog (which the United States is not used to being) is able to come out on top in the end

Two players from Bowling Green State University were on that team and they are totally ignored. UNH is mentioned in the script, but in reality, that university was not represented on the team.

Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, is supposed to be Mr. Macho so he has to use excessive vulgarity to achieve his goal in the eyes of this stereotypically written script. In practice he resolves a conflict between two rival players by having them beat each other up. Now how logical is that? Again, typical Hollywood writing. The people on the coast should ""get out a little more"" and see the rest of the world. It's ""group think"" to the point of being a case study.

2024900,5,B0001US67I,"I remember watching the United States' defeat of the vaunted Russian Olympic hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. The Russians were undefeated since 1961. And 1960 was the last year we won the ""Gold"". The title of the movie is an apt description of the USA upset at Lake Placid in 1980.

This movie shows what it took to mold individuals into a well-coordinated team in just seven months of very hard work. Up until 1980, no team was ever willing to train as hard as was required to defeat the Russian team. Not only is skill on the ice, but actually physical endurance. Our young team of average age of 21 years stepped up to the plate and exceeded that goal.

This movie also shows that you cannot win a team sport by choosing the best players and calling them a team. But that it takes a group of team players working together. This movie brought back all the excitement I felt watching the game. And also let's you see what it took back then to be an Olympic team player. Now we use professional players in so called DREAM TEAMS. Well if you ask me, the 1980 team of amateur athletes that brought home the Gold Medal was the Dream Team. And I wish the Olympics had not evolved as it has.

This is a movie for everyone. You do not need to know about the sport of ice hockey to enjoy it. It is a pleasure to watch people play for the pure pleasure of the sport instead of money. The casting between a season actor like Kurt Russell, unseasoned actors, and actual hockey player was well done. You can tell that the cast and crew paid attention to details.

2024901,5,B0001US67I,"There have been many defining moments in U.S. Sports, such as Don Larsen's perfect game in the world series, or Babe Ruth's ""called shot', but no individual or team captured the heart and essence of America like the 1980 men's Olympic hockey team.  What started out as a group of college individuals seven months before the games began were melded into a cohesive team formed in the hard-nosed image of their coach, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell).

This team was not given much of a chance against the powerhouse eastern-bloc countries.  The Soviet Union team had beaten a team of NHL all-stars rather easily, and had won every Olympic gold medal since 1960.  The Swiss and Czech teams were also considered out of the U.S team's class.

Undaunted, Brooks prepared his team to beat the Soviets at their own game; pass and attack.  This approach didn't fare to well in a pre-Olympic tune-up game at  Madison Square Garden, where the Soviets beat the U.S. 10-3.

Once the Olympics began, the Americans began to surprise people with their level of play.  Not expected to reach the medal round, the U.S complied an undefeated 4-0-1 record in the preliminaries, the tie coming against Sweden in the first game.  This vaulted the U.S. into the medal round and another match with the Soviets.  This time, the U.S. was not afraid.  Behind the extraordinary goaltending of Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), the U.S. won the game 4-3 in what is considered the greatest upset in Olympic history.  The U.S. Team went on to win the gold medal by defeating Finland in the gold medal game.

This is a superb movie.  Kurt Russell' s portrayal of head coach Herb Brooks is simply perfect.  Russell brings out every quality of Brooks; from his passion to be the best to his unbelievable drive to have his players succeed and believe in themselves.  It was this constant encouragement from Brooks that ultimately helped the players achieve their goal.  Noah Emmerich (ass't coach Craig Patrick), Eddie Cahill (Jim Craig) and Patrick O'Brien Demsey (Mike Eruzonie) give excelent performances as well.

I was 15 years old when the U.S won the gold medal in hockey.  I can remember the tremendous feeling of pride that these men gave to the United States at a time when the U.S. was down with high unemployment and the capture of the hostages in Iran.  These men will be heroes forever.  Its a tragedy that Herb Brooks passed away before being able to see this wonderful memoir of a few months that paved the way to Olympic history.

2024905,4,B0001US67I,"""Miracle"" is an entertaining movie that chronicles the stunning upset by the U.S. Olympic Hockey team over the former Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. This movie follows the team from its formation all the way through its upset victory against a heavily favored Soviet team- a decisive victory that led to a Gold Medal for the Americans following a win against Finland.

What sets this film apart from other sports movies is its direct plot. Unlike other movies that deviate from the main plot at some point, this film stays completely focused. It starts out talking about Herb Brooks and his selection of players for the Olympic team. Then, it follows the players as the take part in grueling daily practices. Then, it shows them practicing and playing exhibition games. Finally, it shows them triumphing over the Soviet Union's team in front of a sellout crowd of fans who are whipped into a frenzy over what is taking place before their eyes. There is little else covered here outside of hockey. At one point, the film shows Brooks and his wife watching television and learning that a group of Americans have just been taken hostage in Iran. Director Gavin O'Connor could have developed all sorts of different subplots using this or other themes. But he sticks to hockey from beginning to end.

Another positive of this film is Kurt Russell. He is great as coach Heb Brooks and his look and accent are befitting of the man he played. Russell is tough and knows what it takes to win. He can be credited in this movie with some memorable quotes and with taking the viewer back to the 1970's with his hair style and fashion. The long locks of hair and the plaid suits will have many people reminiscing about this bygone cultural era.

There is little character development among the players on the team. But this is primarily because, like I said before, there are no real subplots developed. The movie sticks to hockey so the guys on the team really don't have the opportunity to strut their stuff when it comes to acting. They condition, and they play hockey. There are a few conflicts between Brooks and some of the players, but these conflicts don't last very long. They are quickly resolved and the team and coaches return their focus to winning games.

Overall, this is a highly entertaining film that most viewers will find uplifting and enduring. Of course, we already know how the story ends. But the predictability doesn't matter in this instance. Winning against some of the best teams in the world is no easy task, but the members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team and coach Herb Brooks are determined to dream big and achieve the impossible. And this event is captured and brought back to life in this memorable, entertaining movie.",1123200000,2,2782,4.7181069958847734
2024906,5,B0001US67I,"Miracle is the story of the United States Olympic Hockey Team, that, in 1980, managed to overcome impossible odds and defeat the greatest hockey team of that time.......

Kurt Russel stars as Herb Brooks, a hockey coach who had an unrealistic dream, to beat the best Olympic Hockey team in the world and become the new dream team coach.

He faces impossible odds; from forming a team of young, college kids who are more interested in checking out the female fans in their first game, to making sure his wife knows that he loves her more than the game itself, which he is obsessively obsessed about. He even has to remind fans that this is just a game, and that, ""Killing Commie B**tards,"" isn't what Hockey is all about.

Then of course, there's the stress of playing the games themselves.....

26 men, all fighting for a chance to become a 20 man team. Each man had to go through hell to get their rightful place at being the best the US had to offer. Eddie Cahill stars as Jim Craig, the goalie of the team, who's mother just died and had a dream that her son would make it to the olympic team. With his father at ringside it was an emotional moment for both father and son.

Other men were great as acting like the family they all said they were. Nathan West [who plays Rob McClanahan] Patrick O'Brien Demsey [who plays Mike Eruzione] Bobby Hanson [who plays Dave Silk] all give great supporting roles as the team mates who bonded after some rocky starts between some of them as the season started.

One memorable scene was Brooks' way of teaching the young men some respect for the game after giving them drill after drill when the stadium had emptied and they were the only one's left in the dark. It just made the men strive to become more like the team that Brooks knew they could turn out to be.

The movie is filled with thrilling hockey game shots, some hard hitting action as the opponents constantly bash into each other, and some really great saves by Craig, made the games seem as important to the viewers as they were to the players.

This is a great movie and the DVD comes with some great extras;

""The Making of Miracle""

Adio Commentary by the Director, Gavin O'Conner, and others

2024909,4,B0001US67I,"There is little question when one looks at what is one of the great sports stories our the 20th Century, the Gold Medal Victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics by the Men's United States Hockey team has to rank up there as one of the top ones.  This was highlighted by an improbable victory over the Soviet Union en route to the gold medal. ""Miracle"" is a movie that tells the story of Herb Brooks (who sadly died in an auto accident shortly before the film's release).  He is the coach that led the U.S. team to that 1980 gold medal.  This is a movie that is highlighted by one of the great acting performances of recent years by Kurt Russell who would play Brooks.

At the time, when it came to the Olympics -  there was still debate over what exactly ""amateur"" status meant.  We took it as those players who did not play in a professional league as being eligible.  It was very different in the Eastern Bloc and Communist countries where players basically played for state-controlled hockey teams - thus all had amateur status.  As a result, countries like the United States and Canada were not sending the best players to the Olympics.  In the case of Men's Hockey, the teams in the 1970s were basically formed as a collection of College All Stars.  As a result, our teams were completely overmatched in International competition by these foreign powers.  It was Brooks who was selected by the Olympic committee as the coach who would put together a team that would make the improbable run at the gold medal.

The term ""Miracle"" comes from announcer Al Michaels.  Michaels was the play-by-play man for Hockey at the 1980 Olympics (In ""Miracle"", Michaels' commentary with Ken Dryden is widely featured).  When the U.S. would beat the Soviet Union, Michaels coined the famous expression ""Do You Believe in Miracles?"".  As for this movie, this ultimately has an ending that most people know about (although the U.S. had to be Finland following the Soviet Union win in order to get gold - which they did).  So the strength of this movie isn't so much the story, it is around the coach - Herb Brooks.

Kurt Russell gives one of the great performances in any movie.  It is definitely the top performance he has given in his career.  I'm completely surprised that this performance didn't garner a Academy Award nomination (in my opinion, he should have won the award)  My memories of Herb Brooks were one as a stoic coach - most notably the stoic coach of some mediocre New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars, and Pittsburgh Penguins teams.  ""Miracle"" brings out a whole new side to Brooks.  Despite the fact that Herb Brooks himself was a consultant to the movie - this side of Brooks was one that can be validated by many of the players who played on that Hockey team.  We see a coach who was passionate about the game, winning, and most importantly his country.  A good part of this movie is devoted to Brooks' obsession of defeating the Soviets.  This is evident when there was talk of a boycott of the Moscow games could cause the Soviets to pull out of the 1980 games.  Ultimately it is Russell's performance that is going to make us believe that he really is Herb Brooks.  The movie's most emotional scene is when Herb Brooks holds a grueling late night workout - even as the arena was about to shut down and the lights were turned off.  While I always thought of Herb as a laid-back coach, this completely changed my perception of him.  Another point that I found interesting is how Herb Brooks had to meld the personalities of the players from two the hotbeds of Collegiate Hockey - Boston and Minnesota.

It is worth noting that this is not the first movie made about the U.S. Men's Gold Medal run.  Shortly after the victory, ABC did a made for TV movie called ""Miracle on Ice"".  This movie also told the story of the U.S. Men's Gold Medal Run.  This movie did feature a much more stoic Herb Brooks - this one was played by Karl Malden.  While ""Miracle"" really focuses more on Brooks himself, ""Miracle on Ice"" focused more on the team - most notably the relationship of Brooks and his team captain Mike Eruzione (played by Andrew Stevens, but also featured Steve Guttenberg as Jim Craig).  ""Miracle on Ice"" seemed to dramatize things more to make an interesting story.  In a lot of ways, I prefer the approach taken in ""Miracle"" to do a character study on Herb Brooks instead.

Another thing I like about ""Miracle"" is how they cast the players in the movie.  Instead of trying to cast big name actors and try to either make them Hockey players or use doubles, Director Gavin O'Connor goes the opposite route.  He decides to cast actual Hockey players and make them actors.  The formula seems to work because you get some incredible skating sequences on the ice.  In fact real-life U.S. Olympic Hockey Player Buzz Schneider is played by his son Billy.  As a result, you aren't going to have the players have as prominent a role in the story, but they still get the job done.

Finally it is worth noting the movie's opening does a great job at setting the tone of the morale of the country in early 1980.  The country was still on the heels of Watergate, the Vietnam War, the Energy Crisis, the Iranian Hostage situation, and inflation.  The morale was ripe for a bunch of heroes to emerge as boost the morale.  Perhaps this is what launched what Ronald Reagan would term ""The New Patriotism"".

Overall, this is a very good movie.  Despite the fact that most people are going to know the ending, it's still a terrific character study.  Russell's performance will have you wanting more.  Highly recommended.",1118275200,3,5609,4.582329317269076

The movie was very inspiring and I just loved how Kurt Russel played Herb Brooks the coach for the U.S.A. hockey team of 1980.  This really is the story of 1980.  The actors that portrayed the hockey players were really good young actors.  Walt Disney did great with a sports film once again just as they id with Rememberr the Titans.  The documentary on the special feautures is incredible.  One thing that they could have done with the special feautures was to put the whole original game played on there.

2024914,5,B0001US67I,"One of the more inspiring films of all time, Miracle is the 2004 Disney rendition of the 1980 US Olympic hockey team's improbable pursuit of Olympic Gold. Based on the true story of the team that captured the nation's imagination, it connects with audience like few movies of its kind...

The story follows the life of Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), a highly successful college hockey coach who just missed being a part of the last US Olympic gold medal ice hockey team in 1960. Several months before the Olympic games, Brooks is given the task of putting together an amateur hockey made up of mostly college students - one that can compete with the mighty Soviet juggernaut which has not only some of the best players in the world, but a team that has been playing together for over 15 years.

Along the way, Brooks faces a challenge from the team's committee members when he decides to form a roster that fails to include some of the best known players at the time. Intent on choosing a team and not a collection of individual stars, Brooks win his battle, and most of the final roster is pinned down on the first day.

Slowly, Brooks brings the players together (many of them from competing colleges) and creates a true team. Following a loss to Sweden in which his players were more focused on the girls in the crowd than on winning the game, Brooks pushes his players through a series of conditioning drills. He forces them to continuously push and push to the next level, until they are at the brink of exhaustion. He tells them they don't have the talent to beat the Soviets, but they will be the best conditioned team on the ice.

By exerting as much psychological and physical pressure possible on his players, Brooks finds out who has the mental capacity to take the US team to the top level. When the 1980 Olympic games arrive at Lake Placid, the Soviets are the overwhelming favorites. The US team meets the Soviets in the semi-finals, and with gut and grit, they defeat them against overwhelming odds.

Born from a true story that played out in the height of the Cold War (and Soviet power specifically), Miracle is an inspiring tale of teamwork, freedom's triumph over oppression, and the great heights to which ordinary men can aspire. Uplifting and personally touching, this is a film that no sports fan, movie lover, or American should miss. It's central theme drives at the heart of what it means to be American, prompting Al Michaels' famous one-liner ""Do you believe in miracles?"" Do yourself a favor and watch Miracle...

When I watched the movie for the first time I was amazed at how those old feelings came back.  When you try to explain to people, who weren't old enough to watch this team of college kids beat the best team in hockey, how it felt words just don't do justice.

2024918,5,B0001US67I,"1979-1980 was a critical time in U.S. history. In fact, the post-9/11 world in which we now live in many ways resembles the beginning of that fateful decade.  The Middle East was in turmoil and terrorists had hijacked a plane with a bunch of American citizens and was holding them hostage. People were afraid of traveling overseas because of the threat and gas shortages and prices caused people to begin carpooling, walking, and biking to work. The Cold War had been going on for almost 35 years without WW III breaking loose, but for the first time since the Cuban Missle Crisis, the Cold War was heating up in a major way and everyone was fearful of world annihilation through a nuclear war. There was talk that the Soviet Union was thinking of boycotting the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid as a sign of contempt (something President Carter actually forced the U.S. to do during 1980 Summer Games in Moscow) and the nation was on edge.

But in February of 1980, the nation witnessed something that revived everyone's spirits and united people in a way they hadn't been since the middle of Vietnam.  During the Semi-final game of the Olympic hockey game, the amatuer U.S. team beat the mighty Soviet powerhouse in a sport they had dominated for more than 20 years.  The chanting of ""U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A"" was first heard during those games and the little team that could went on to win the gold medal by defeating Finnland.

MIRACLE is a movie that recreates those events.  The tone, mood, and setting is captured almost perfectly and places the audience right in the midst of what it was like living in America in 1979-1980. Great pains have been taken not only to just physically recreate the events that the members of the U.S. hockey team went through, but the emotions and mentality, too.

The ""actors"" playing the hockey players in the movie really aren't ""actors"" but are instead first and foremost real hockey players.  This is just one example of many that illustrates the extent the filmmakers went through to get things right.

However, though the movie is thought as being about the 1980 U.S. hockey team, it's really a very personal movie that really isn't about the team, but about the man who led them there, Herb Brooks.  Brooks had played on the 1960 team that lost to the Soviets for the first time and since that time had made it his life's ambition to beat the Russians at their own game. The majority of the country had no idea at the time of Brooks' unusual and somewhat controversial training methods and even if they had I don't think most people would have given it much thought.  It was Brooks' determination and leadership that formed the team and gave them the opportunity to perform a little ""miracle"" for all the world to see.

A couple a bits of trivia about the film.  The scene in MIRACLE where the players are forced by Brooks to skate back and forth doing drills after their 3-3 tie with Norway was filmed over the course of 3 days, 12 hours a day because the filmmakers wanted the ""actors"" to look as exhausted as possible. Also, the shot of New York that is seen in the movie with the World Trade Center in the background is actual footage shot for the movie, post 9-11. The Two Towers are seen in the picture were actually digitally recreated, making MIRACLE the first movie to ""create"" the towers since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

MIRACLE is a movie sure to stir up some sort of emotion from those who were alive to watch the famous moment of sport live. For those who have only read about the event in history books or watched it on ESPN or on a DVD, the effect isn't quite the same and the movie will probably not have as much significance. Nevertheless, the film is well made and makes for a great sports picture.",1109721600,7,3779,4.571005917159764

Not necessarily the best and the brightest, Brooks took this group of misfits and molded them to HIS liking against all odds, and against the convential wisdom of everyone within the realms of amateur hockey, to take them to the very pinnacle of superstardom; an Olympic Gold Medal.

2024921,5,B0001US67I,"I am a HUGE hockey fan (poor me, no hockey this season) and miracle is definitely the best hockey movie ever made, and it ranks high on the top sports movies ever made. Miracle really was a hard movie to make, because they needed to make sure the hockey scenes were believable, but the acting had to be there too. They chose to do the right thing, which is teach great hockey players how to act rather than having actors have stunt doubles play hockey for them. This way they can do head shots while they are on the ice and make it way more believable rather than just seeing feet skating along the ice. The Mighty Ducks movies (though great for kids) really lacked in the hockey scenes, as most people know. Another thing that makes the movie so hard, is that now that they have good hockey players, they still need to make the goals/assists/body checks as close to the real thing in 1980 as possible. On the special features they show you tape of a real goal scored against the Soviets, which went right through the goalies legs, and they show you the movie version...its a spitting image. Amazing job on the directors part, and the hockey players who, in a sense actually have to ""act"" while playing hockey. All in all, Miracle does a great job at showing how much of an underdog U.S.A. was (though i wasn't born then, i can only imagine what it was like) and how amazing of a feat it was to beat the russians. Miracle also ties in some smaller stories that make the movie better, such as Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and his family life and how his coaching gets in the way of being with his wife and kids. I could go on forever about Miracle, but the only way to end this is to go with Al Michaels' famous line counting down the last 3 seconds of the game against the soviets : DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?

2024922,5,B0001US67I,"The amazing thing about the film version of the 1980 USA Hockey team's incredible victory over the Russians is that even though we know how it ends, director Gavin O'Connor makes us feel the tension so that the result is as exhilarating as if we'd never known.

MIRACLE is one of the best sports movies I've seen.  Starting with a fresh uncompromising script, a lot of heart and an incredibly controlled performance by Kurt Russell, this movie shows us how the twenty diverse young men who had never played together before as a team, learn how to become a team.  At first, it may seem Coach Herb Brooks is way too harsh on his team, but as the movie unfolds, we see that he was smart in knowing exactly what had to be done to get the team to the point it reaches.

The fiercely unrecognized Patricia Clarkson is marvelous as Brooks' understanding, yet outspoken wife.  Noah Emmerich is very good as Craig, Brooks' assistant coach who takes a while to fully understand Brooks' sometimes questionable coaching tactics.  All the guys playing the hockey players are perfect, with Eddie Cahill and Patrick Sean Dempsey standing out.  But as in the case with the hockey team, it's not a solo effort, rather a group performance helmed by Russell's outstanding performance.  It's sad that the real Herb Brooks never saw the completed film; he surely would have been proud of what the filmmakers did with this envigorating and inspiring true tale.  If more sports movies had this much heart, they'd be better movies.",1105315200,3,1507,4.743295019157088
2024923,4,B0001US67I,"I am looking for the right ones"". And that is really what this movie is all about: the power of people working together as a team instead of individually. Nowadays, we are tired of seeing superstars in different team sports that think that they are the greatest thing in the world and that their teammates are just the supporting cast. This is true in the US mostly in football and basketball, and in other countries in the word mainly in soccer.

I was born in Uruguay and lived there until the year 2000, and therefore am a big soccer fan. I am tired of seeing the players from my country excel in their European clubs only to see them fail miserably when they play for our country. The reason is that several of them think they are stars when they come to play for Uruguay and neglect to play as a team. They should all get together and give this movie a try!

Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) is the new coach of the US men's hockey team that will compete in the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid and has a huge task ahead of him. The Soviets dominate the world's ice hockey and US was embarrassed in their last attempt in the Olympiads. But this is not all that Herb has to face in order to succeed. Right from the start he has to fight against the politics surrounding hockey in order to be able to select the players he wants instead of the ones he is supposed to choose. Also, several players carry grudges from their college games and are unwilling to help each other.

The movie revolves around the challenges faced when trying to create an efficient team, the stress of competition and the spillover of work into one's personal life and the strain this causes. Of course, if you like ice hockey you are probably going to enjoy this movie a lot. However, if you do not like or understand the sport, you can still enjoy the storyline. In my case, working in a company that has season tickets for the current champion of the National Hockey League, the Tampa Bay Lightning, it was easy enough to start learning about the sport and loving it before watching this production.",1101859200,25,2077,4.417754569190601

Here we have the underdogs of USA vs. the best team in the world hands down; not to mention that USA was just a bunch of college kids that have never played with each other before only against each other. Not only did the kids from team USA have to beat the Soviets and every other team in the Olympics but they also had to become united. Of course it's not that hard to become united, but with a bunch of rival college kids playing as a whole it was. Team USA had to put aside their differences and become a team more importantly to become a family.

I think it was Mark Johnson who said, ""We're a family"" as they were leaving for the Olympic Games in lake placid. And that's exactly what they had become. When you are on a hockey team you become so close to the guys you are with it's amazing. The best feeling in the world is being in that locker room with those guys and knowing when you step on that ice they are right with you. It's a bond no one can ever take from you. The movie depicted this so well that I was floored when watching how close every player was with each other. If you notice the way they acted when the players first practiced: O.C and Rob got into a fight over what had happened in the past. Later in the movie you notice the camaraderie especially on Christmas when the team goes to the doc's house for a team party.

Kurt Russell also did an outstanding job playing the part of Herb Brooks. From the way he talked right down to the style of coach he was. It was amazing to see the way Herb coached from the inside of the locker room. All I knew was what was said about him in the past. Now we went inside of Herb Brooks and really understood him as not just the coach that beat the Soviets but as a man and his passion for the game.

The other interesting part of the movie was that all the players actually had to work very hard to imitate the plays. Every game is almost the mirror image of what really happened. The directors and players broke down every move and goal and worked on it endlessly to make the perfect miracle on ice.

The way the players on Team USA showed their emotions made me really believe I was watching the real miracle. From the way loved the game to playing the game with all their heart. Herb Brooks told Rob Mclanahan in the game vs. Sweden that ""a bruise on the leg is a hell of a long way from the heart"" and this changed the attitude of not just Rob but they rest of team USA.

I am amazed at the attention to detail in the movie and my kids cannot stop watching it! Not only was the equipment of that era (skate blades, goalie pads/gloves, suspenders) accurate, but the style of play by the goalie, Jim Craig was very accurately enacted; a style played back then (but not played today). The story is one of a team accomplishment and thus they did not dwell much on any individual character - hats off to the director/writer for not hollywooding it up! This movie will be enjoyed by all, but many of the hockey details will only be understood by guys who played back then...AWESOME!",1098662400,3,728,4.607692307692307
2024928,4,B0001US67I,"As sports movies go, MIRACLE is pretty good. Especially if you were around in 1980 and remember the actual events. I'm not really a hockey fan, just like I'm not really a figure skating fan, but somehow the fact that it's the Olympics always seems to heighten my interest. MIRACLE is quite good in setting the mood of the time and in dramatizing the growing attention across the country as the US hockey team progressed through its schedule that year. The day they played the Soviets, everybody I knew was in front of a TV somewhere watching. Streets were unusually quiet. The excitement of that moment and the tenseness of that game come through in MIRACLE.

There are two things that keep MIRACLE from being a great sports movie. The first is that it is ultimately more about the hockey than it is about the players. Despite some nods toward the personal interplay among the various personalities on the team, the personal angle isn't developed much. In the end, it's more about the team than the players, so you don't ever feel much involvement with them in spite of their personal trials and tribulations. The second thing is that, although Kurt Russell does a good job portraying Coach Herb Brooks, he never really becomes the focus of the story, either. Again, it's more about the team and winning the gold than it is about the coach and his personal struggles. So, again, the chance to draw the viewer in more fully is missed. We all know who won the game, so without more development of the personal element, there just isn't enough tension in MARACLE. It plays almost like a documentary, which may have been the intent, but it doesn't engage the viewer as well as it might have.

I liked MIRACLE and I certainly feel it's worth seeing. It's a good portrayal of the actual events, especially if you remember them. It has lots of nostalgia appeal. It could have been better, though. Give it a look, but don't expect something with the heart of a movie like HOOSIERS. It just doesn't quite get there.",1098489600,2,2006,4.632022471910112
2024929,5,B0001US67I,"I don't understand some reviews on Amazon. This was a really good movie. The reason it was good is that it was about hockey - and didn't get really sidetracked with other issues, like a romance or delving into the players' personalities. The movie was meant to focus on the coach and the TEAM - not about individual side issues, like so many Hollywood recreations do.

Miracle showed the intensity of the coach and the dedication of the players.

Another thing I liked about this movie is the hockey action - it was very realistic, unlike some other Hollywood presentations of hockey. The coach (Kurt Russell) and the players could actually skate!

All in all, an excellent family movie.

(From a Canadian who's a big hockey fan - even at this time with the NHL lockout!!!)",1098489600,,773,4.661764705882353
2024930,2,B0001US67I,"Those who made ""Miracle"" seem to think that none of us have ever seen a movie about a sports team before.  Even though it is based on a true story, the film is so derivative and formulaic that you could practically write the screenplay yourself (had scenarist Eric Guggenheim not already done it for you, that is).  Despite the best efforts of Kurt Russell in the lead role, there isn't a single original or surprising moment in the entire 134 minutes that the film takes to drag us through its story.

Russell plays Herb Brooks, a hockey coach from Minnesota who fulfills his dream of leading an American team to a gold medal against the Soviets in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid.  Brooks is the ultimate sports film stereotype: a coach driven to extremes to make his team the best that it can be.  More drill sergeant than coach, he pushes his players almost to the breaking point, carrying his ""tough love"" philosophy nearly to the level of sadism.  But, of course, this uncompromising taskmaster is just what this ragtag collection of hockey players needs to achieve cohesion and discipline, break through their underdog status, and pull off a ""miraculous"" win on the ice.  And this is also what eventually earns him the undying respect and allegiance of his players, fellow coaches and financial backers, all of whom greet Brooks with initial skepticism until they see the miracle he is able to perform.

It's hard to overestimate just how vapid and corny most of ""Miracle"" turns out to be.  The boys have so little personality that they quickly become both interchangeable as teammates and indistinguishable as individuals.  Patricia Clarkson plays the stereotypical loving wife who nevertheless whines and pouts endlessly because her hubby is devoting all his time to the team and none to the family at home.  Much of the dialogue is of the rah-rah, pep talk, we-are-family variety, made all the more mawkish by a lugubrious symphonic score droning on incessantly in the background.

The raison d'etre that is supposed to separate ""Miracle"" from all those countless films that have come before it is the fact that this team beat the Soviets at a time when not only was the Cold War at its height but the Russians had just invaded Afghanistan, the Iranians were holding American citizens hostage, and American motorists were stuck in long gas lines during the peak of the ""energy crisis.""  We even hear a snippet of President Carter's infamous ""malaise"" speech to underscore just how badly Americans were feeling about themselves and how much of a moral boost this victory gave to the beleaguered nation.  The film, however, despite its good intentions, is simply not rich or resonant enough to sustain this broader theme.  Thus, even with all the swelling music and inspirational speeches, ""Miracle"" can't overcome the triteness at its core.  ""Miracle"" is a feel-good movie for the easily impressed.",1096502400,3,2915,4.918367346938775
2024931,5,B0001US67I,"In 1980 in Lake Placid, NY, at the Olympic Winter Games, one of the greatest sporting events ever happened. This event was when the United States ice hockey team defeated the Soviet Union in a semifinal game, and went on to winning the gold medal. This event was huge for American hockey because the Soviet Union had one the gold medal at the last four Olympic Games. It was a huge upset and one of the greatest sports stories ever. The movie ""Miracle"" is the story of the 1980 U.S. hockey team, and their journey to upset the Soviets and win the gold medal. ""Miracle"" is the true story of the ""miracle on ice"", which the event was named.

 ""Miracle"" is a hockey movie, and yet so much more than that. It's the story of a group of individuals coming together to form a team, and going up against seemingly impossible odds. It's an inspiring movie, mainly because it was an inspiring event. This event showed that the United States was still able to be a dominate force. Although it was ""just a hockey game"", it was much more than that because it gave people something to believe in. America wasn't in the greatest of states, and people were starting to loose hope. This event gave hope back to Americans, and gave them something to be proud of. It was a gigantic upset that no one ever really thought would happen. Americans once again had faith in our country, at a very much needed time. This event was inspiring then, and the movie is inspiring now.

 Being a hockey player myself, I can relate pretty well to many parts of this movie. The training process in the movie is most likely what the actual 1980 players did. It was without a doubt a very realistic process, and similar to things I've had to do myself. The hockey scenes are amazing as well. They are very realistic, and very well shot. The viewer has the feeling that they are there, actually viewing the game. I think that this is the most realistic hockey movie that there is, but it is also so much more than that. I would recommend anyone interested to watch this movie, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

 I thought that the acting in this movie was great. Kurt Russell played and amazing Herb Brookes. Herb Brookes was the coach of the 1980 team, and his character is a huge part of the movie. Russell's mannerisms and voice was so close to Herb Brookes I couldn't believe it. Russell even looked like him, with the haircut and outfits. I don't think that anyone else could have pulled off a better Herb Brookes than Kurt Russell did. Besides Russell, I thought that all of the other actors did an amazing job. Granted they didn't look identical to the real players, but they sure did look pretty close. The accents that they used and mannerisms also fit the players that they were portraying. The actors playing guys who were from Boston actually sounded like they were from Boston. The most important part to me though was that all of the players could really play the game. I could tell that they all seemed to have a decent amount of hockey experience from the way they skated and moved out on the ice. I thought the acting was fantastic, and the action was just as amazing.

 If you enjoyed this movie, I would recommend watching ""Do you believe in Miracles? The story of the 1980 U.S. Hockey Team"". This was made by HBO Studios, and came out on DVD about the same time as ""Miracle"". This DVD has interviews with the real players as well as Herb Brookes, the 1980 coach. It also has a ton of real footage from practices and training sessions, as well as a good amount of real game footage. I remember watching it when it came out on HBO, and I was amazed at how good it was. I'm really happy that it came out on DVD, because it's a great documentary. If you liked the movie I highly recommend getting this as well.",1096416000,3,3791,4.421203438395415
2024932,2,B0001US67I,"Don't get me wrong, this filmed moved along okay, but it's certainly not the edge-of-your-seat movie that many here are saying.  The story of the 1980 US hockey team is one that will always be remembered.  However, this movie misses on several levels.  The actors playing the parts of the US hockey team seem to have no real acting experience (and the sometimes lame dialog throughout also hurt the film).  Kurt Russell was great in Breakdown, so there's no denying he is a fine actor...but he should have not tried to re-create a faux Canadian-accent for the film.  And the dubbed-over Al Michael's play-by-play took the last bit of enjoyment from the film (he is annoying enough to listen to on MNF, and now you have to hear him in this movie).

I was almost in junior high school during this time and 'Miracle' sure did bring back a lot of memories for me!

 Kurt Russell(one of my favorite actors!)plays head coach Herb Brooks. He does a great job here as always and after just a few moments, you forget that it's Russell on the screen and not the real Brooks. I have to say that I really loved seeing the plaid wardrobe! He really gave a fabulous performance showing Brooks' drive to win the gold despite horrible odds and at great expense to himself. His players may hate him for training them so hard, but he thinks if they do, it will give them something in common and they won't have time to hate each other.

Alot of great moments in the movie dealing with the different players and the DVD had some great extras with a lot of behind the scenes stuff.  My only suggestion would be to include the deleted scenes.

Coach Brooks ran a tight ship and ran his players hard, but there was always a reason for what he did and the movie shows this well.  He took a bunch of young players who were selected for his program and they were very much a divided unit, undisciplined and with old school rivalries and different personalities coming between them. They ended up growing together and became a family by the time they got to Lake Placid and it was a very realistic transformation.  Suffering through Brooks' strenuous and sometimes even unbelievable training methods gave them all something in common and bonded them forever.

The game scenes were filmed incredibly well and you actually do feel like you're seeing the real thing. Very emotional.

All the actors did a great job and the casting was perfect!

2024937,5,B0001US67I,"We watched this movie at my brothers over the weekend - what a great ""feel good"" movie. It's the true story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team defeating the unstoppable Soviet Union. It wasn't so much about winning the Olympics ... it was about the U.S. beating the Soviets. Kurt Russell portrays Coach Herb Brooks and is excellent. He plays Brooks in an understated and solid manner (and he's got some really spiffy '80s outfits too ... check out the plaid pants!)- and does a good job of keeping you interested in how he's going to turn this group of kids into an Olympic-Gold-Worthy hockey team.

This is not a hockey movie. This is a story about having dreams and giving 110%, not leaving anything on the table, and going for a goal with everything you've got. Yes - everyone before you has failed - yes everyone is expecting you to fail. You still go for it.

And then ... This is a hockey movie. As a hockey fan, I thoroughly enjoyed all the game scenes. I can't imagine what it would have been like to watch the actual game on TV in 1980! I'd recommend this movie to anybody (especially hockey fans) and there's no foul language, so it's good for the whole family.

Go Team Go!

A few favorite parts ...

For weeks, Herb asks each player who they play for ... and they would all respond their college team names. Finally, one night after a grueling post-game ""psych-work-out"" ... they get it. And when he asks who do they play for ... USA! They're finally getting to be a TEAM.

Brooks: ""Great moments are born from great opportunity.""

Brooks: ""When you pull on that jersey, the name on the front is a hell of alot more important than the one on the back.""

Brooks: ""Tonight, *we* are the greatest hockey team in the world.

My son's enthusiastic recommendation that I rent the DVD finally sent me out to get it and for a few hours on a rainy afternoon I went back in time - and what a time it was.

The character of Herb Brooks is captured completely by Kurt Russell and the work that went into making the movie authentic was outstanding. The DVD version shows how the filming was done and that is almost as entertaining as the movie itself.

The movie captures the feeling of the times and the impossible task awaiting our Olympic hopefuls. The hockey scenes are the best ever done. Do you believe in miracles? Yes! Blieve me this one is worth seeing again!!",1092182400,4,825,4.309677419354839

I remember watching the game and I can still remember shots of the crowd going wild, huge US flags.  It was a powerfully cathartic experience for all of us who saw it.

This film does the story proud.  Kurt Russell doesn't look much like the real Herb Brooks, but his acting is so superb and on mark, that it doesn't matter.  I liked learning more about the players who made up that historic hockey team, and learning more about Herb Brooks.

It was still early 1980 when this happened.  Jimmy Carter was still president.  Ronald Reagan wouldn't be elected until November of that year, or take office until January 1981.  Americans were starved for something to believe in and be proud of again.  Herb Brooks and this glorious hockey team gave us a reason to cheer and be proud.",1091404800,,927,4.394117647058824
2024940,5,B0001US67I,"I'm not a big fan of spectator sports. A group of guys batting, kicking and/or hitting a ball around a field doesn't do much for me, usually. But one time when guys, pucks and sticks made me cheer, as I sat riveted to my TV screen, was during the 1980 Olympic ""Miracle.""
1979-1980 were not good years for the United States. Militant Iranians took US citizens hostage in our embassy in Teheran, the USSR invaded Afghanistan, the Cold War was at below zero temperatures, and at home gas prices were sky high, as were interest rates. The film is set in the context of this period, which makes it even more exciting. Americans really needed something to cheer about.
In the summer of 1980, newly hired US Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks took a group of boys, average age 21, worked them 'til they dropped for seven months, taught them new strategies, made them into a cohesive team, and miraculously led them to unbelievable victory. They beat the pants off the unbeatable champion Soviet hockey team in what has been called the ""Miracle on Ice."" In a super surprise win, the underdog US team, which had played poorly against the much older Russian veterans a few weeks before at Madison Square Garden, made all the right moves to score success, 4 to 3. The team then went on to win Olympic Gold! The Cold War may be long over, but remembering the moment still feels sweet. The look on the Soviet coach's face alone is worth the price of the rental. And now the ""moment"" and more can be relived - seen on the big screen, with accurate details and superb characterizations, in director Gavin O'Connor's and screenwriter Eric Guggenheim's ""Miracle.""
Kurt Russell is superb as coach Brooks. He has the Minnesota accent down pat, chews gum like Brooks - 500 chews per minute...and even looks like him. Actual ice hockey players were cast as teammates in O'Connor's quest to make this an authentic sports film. The last 30 minutes of footage are devoted to the US - Soviet match. But the movie is as much a character study as it is a film about Olympic sport. And Russell's understated, intense performance is compelling. Patricia Clarkson is excellent as Brooks' wife Patty, as is Noah Emmerich as assistant coach Craig Patrick.
The movie is dedicated to Herb Brooks, who was tragically killed in an auto accident over a year ago. He is portrayed as a complex man who was totally dedicated to his sport and his team, to the detriment, at times, of his family life. This is a wonderful film to see with the entire family.

Kurt Russell plays Herb Brooks, the no-nonsense coach who handpicked two-dozen hockey players and trained them in an amazingly short period of time - just in time to beat the highly successful Russians.  In 1980, the Cold War was strong and there was never a better time than to have a little known American hockey team beat the `big, bad' Russians in a small American town called Lake Placid.

2024945,4,B0001US67I,"The first hockey games I ever watched were during the 1980 Winter Olympics and I know I was not alone in that respect.  It took a while to understand what a blue line had to do with icing the puck and I have never gotten past the idea of what basketball would be like if it was played the same way as hockey (you are allowed to foul the guy with the puck/ball).  But I remember watching the games the U.S. Hockey Team played against the Soviet Union and Finland.  How big was the miracle that Al Michaels proclaimed during the final seconds of the semi-final match against the Soviets?  Well, when ""Sports Illustrated"" came out the next week there was no need for a headline or caption on the cover photo of the U.S. team celebrating.

Knowing what is going to happen in ""Miracle"" is important because if we did not know that this team is going to win the gold medal then we might suspect the means that coach Herb Brooks (Kirk Russell) is using to achieve that end.  Brooks is haunted by the 1960 Winter Olympics, when he was cut from the U.S. team a week before it won the gold medal.  It was also the last year the Americans beat the Soviets on the ice and Brooks knows how to pull off the upset against the best hockey team on the planet.  All it will take is a team that he handpicks playing the way he wants them to play.

The best part of this film is watching how Brooks does exactly that and then becomes basically a spectator and cheerleader when his team goes out and wins the gold medal.  Director Gavin O'Connor hits a bulls eye with the casting of Russell, who should get serious Oscar consideration for his performance.  The hard driven coach who puts his sport before his wife and family is something of a clich, but what matters here is how Brooks' determination and intelligence comes through as he molds his team.

The production also scores because they went out and got hockey players to act instead of trying to fake us out the other way around.  The only real professional actor on the team is Eddie Cahill, but he plays goalie Jim Craig.  You can put anybody you want behind a mask in goal on the ice (former Edmonton Oilers' goalie Bill Ranford in fact) and because Craig was such high maintenance and high profile he was the one role where you needed to up the acting level.  But Michael Mantenuto as Jack O'Callahan, Patrick O'Brien Dempsey as Mike Eruzione, Nathan West as Rob McLanahan, Eric Peter-Kaiser as Mark Johnson, and the other 15 players on the team are playing exactly what they are: hockey players brought together to create a team.

One thing I was surprised about in the film was that there is never an explicitly stated reason why Eruzione was picked as the team captain.  Yet in the context of the film I was right in thinking that I knew exactly what Eruzione was going to do that was going to make him stand out as first among his teammates.  (You will know what I am talking about when the moment comes).

The fidelity to recreating the moments we remember from the 1980 Olympics was quite impressive.  You can check out the added features on this two-disc DVD set to see direct comparisons of the television footage from the actual games with the movie's re-creations as well as the techniques used to give you a dynamic feeling of being on the ice.  Of course getting Al Michaels to ""call"" the games again was a necessity and it is not surprising that they worked in the original version of his famous line that gives the movie its title.  You can re-create history but you cannot really improve on it, although this 2004 film does a nice job of trying to accomplish that particular feat. I just wonder if those who know nothing about what happened at Lake Placid in 1980 can appreciate that as much as those of us who do.",1088553600,49,3771,4.411255411255412
2024946,5,B0001US67I,"My teenage son got me to watch this with him, I'm normally not a big sports movie fan, but I really did enjoy this one.  My son was telling me in the middle of one of the exciting game scenes that ""I'm so nervous, even though I know what happens"" so it's definately a good film for the young sports fans, something they can watch over with excitement and  get worked up over for the next big game.
I'm not sure I'd be all that thrilled about watching this movie over, because it's basically a nonfictional story and I'm not going to get excited about it again, but if you have a young sports fan in the family this would make a good gift.  As for family values entertainment, this movie fits the bill, but I don't think the younger set (Mighty Ducks fans for instance) will get the same thrill out of it.
As far as historical type movies go, I think this one was done very well and the acting was great.  A strong recommendation, at least to watch once.",1088380800,,953,4.21978021978022

2024948,4,B0001US67I,"I didn't have very high hopes for this one.  I expected a stereotypical sports movie with lots of ""We're number one!""jingoism and lame little sub-plots about team members who overcome various personal issues at the last moment so they can help their team win the big game.  Instead, what I saw was a gripping recreation of a specific moment in U.S. sports history, the 1980 victory over the Soviet Olympic hockey team--the mood of the country, what this particular victory meant to Americans, and how one driven man, coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), forged a team that was capable of pulling it off.
In a sense, there are really only two main characters in this film--the coach and his team.  Although I came to recognize the players' faces by the end of the film, one of the courageous decisions made by director Gavin O'Connor and screenwriter Eric Guggenheim was to focus on the dynamic between Brooks and his team rather than on individual team players.  This choice allows the filmmakers to avoid many of the usual sports film conventions and tell a story that we don't see very often, the story of the coaching style that brought them success and the enormous pressures placed on the coach himself.  The cast is wonderfully restrained, but Russell is especially good.",1088035200,2,1274,4.825688073394495

2024950,5,B0001US67I,"What an amazing event that took place in 1980, and what an amazing story.  I was only six years old when the game took place, but was unable to watch it on TV.  The Cold War was still at its height.  I recall as a kid we sometimes played a war type game and usually the imaginary enemy was the Soviets.  I'm sure the kids growing up in the Soviet Union where playing war against the imaginary American enemy too.
This movie shows how Herb Brooks molded this group of young men from different colleges and backgrounds into the US Olympic Hockey Team.  Not just a group of men that would play hockey in the Olympics, but a true Team!  At the same time the movie gives us a since of what political events where taking place, and the low moral that Americans felt at that time.  The action scenes on the rink really made us feel that we are there, not only in the stands watching, but actually on the rink.  They used awesome camera shots.  Although we know the outcome of the game, watching it can put you on the edge of your seat.  And when the final buzzer ends the game, you can really feel the pride and happiness that people at Lake Placid and also people at home watching felt back in 1980.  What a moral boost!
Winning a hockey game can seem very trivial, but this win was something we Americans needed.  The pride and moral boost that it gave us was a very welcome gift.  And maybe, just maybe, this hockey game was what helped start the thaw in the Cold War.  Today the Soviet Union is no more, and Russia can be called a friend.  Maybe this game did have a small role in that.",1087516800,,1583,4.195364238410596
2024951,4,B0001US67I,"Absolutely not!  ""Miracle"" takes a simple hockey game(a sport deemed regional to this day), and shows viewers how it not only captivated a nation, but also how a game can come to represent change.
This is a highly motivational film, full of subplots involving many of the characters and political undertones.  When you boil down to it, though, this is a movie about Americans being Americans.  Unlike most films, this one shows the Soviets as the arrogant, unstoppable force.  Soviet hockey was exactly that at the time.  Americans are shown to be average folks just trying to get by, many giving up money for one shot at Olympic glory.
Overall, the film is amazingly accurate.  From dekes and wristers to hairdos and hope, this movie stays true to formula.  The extras are knockout as well.
I highly recommend this movie.  The language isn't too bad(a cuss word here or there), and it has a great message of hope to it.  Don't blow this off as another ""hockey movie.""  ""Slapshot"" this ain't.",1087171200,2,992,4.748538011695906
2024952,5,B0001US67I,"As the Cold War fades into memory, it is hard to explain the on-going, almost mystical fascination with The Miracle on Ice; the defeat of the vaunted Soviets by a bunch of unknown American college kids.  Yes, national pride plays a big role, and more generally everyone loves an underdog.  But I think what has really made this event such a cultural touchstone is the pure joy that surrounded it.  Across the nation, and the world, for a myriad of reasons, but distilled and purified in the players and coaches who pursued their dream not for fame and fortune, but because the only dreams worth chasing are the hard ones.
""Miracle"" captures this spirit down to the smallest nuance; in a day and age when you are as likely to read about athletes in the police blotter as the sports page, it is refreshing to watch people play for the pure joy of sport and love of the game.  The ability to capture this love of the game was made possible by the fact that every single one of the actors portraying a hockey player was first and foremost an actual hockey player.  That's not to say they can't act, but they sought out the opportunity because they have scored Eruzione's game winning goal a thousand times on a rink or pond or even on asphalt and they wanted an opportunity to tap into a little bit of that magic.  They didn't audition for ""Miracle"", they tried out for it, and once they had the job, they went to training camp to prepare for filming.  This attention to detail comes through in spades; I know hockey, but you don't have to be an expert to realize these guys are in great shape and have been on the receiving end of a check more than once.
In contrast to these raw and unseasoned actors stands Kurt Russell, a Hollywood veteran (and admittedly a very big hockey fan). His portrayal of Herb Brooks is dead on; from the voice and mannerisms down to the single minded determination to beat the best team in the world.  Moreover, his punishing conditioning regimen and mind-bending schemes are accurately portrayed without bogging down in details that would likely bore even dedicated fans.  The supporting cast is likewise strong, and wisely limited in large part to just Brooks' wife and assistants.  This focus mirrors the way Brooks lived the game and minimizes distractions.
So the film has real hockey players and fine actors in all the key roles but the most daunting task for the director still remained: how to portray a game where the outcome is know when the NHL hasn't found an entirely effective view for live games.  The answer was to use as many ice level shots as possible, which serves a twofold purpose.  The first is that it is much easier to follow the puck when it is the focus of the shot, and at the same time, when a hit or injury is the key part of the scene, the puck isn't a distraction.  The other reason this approach is successful is because this player's eye view of the ice injects a sense of urgency that makes victory seem in doubt even when it is a known factor.  A corollary to this approach is in the narrative of the game with the Soviets; the director wisely chose not to reinvent the wheel and used Al Michael's definitive call, which includes key commentary from Ken Dryden which can be informative for the non-hockey fan.
In the end, what this all adds up to is the perfect encapsulation of the joy I referenced above.  The cold hard fact is that we are unlikely to ever see such joy in sport again, as professionals have come to dominate Olympic team sports and high schoolers join the pro ranks as soon as they graduate and middle schoolers go to strength and conditioning camps under relentless pressure from their parents.  What ""Miracle"" portrays is a joy born of a love of competition, a love of sport and a love of teammates that has become all too rare.  That's not to say that this movie only portrays sunshine and roses, but the ultimate goal transcended any one individual.  Some of the best scenes in the movie have nothing to do with hockey, but rather the camaraderie that comes from sharing simple things with good friends.
Superb in its portrayal of perhaps the greatest sporting event of all time in every aspect - from acting to wardrobe to the game on the ice, ""Miracle"" is an absolute joy to watch.  It wisely frames the geo-political import of the game and then sets it aside, focusing instead on the beauty of sport and the satisfaction of hard earned accomplishments.

2024962,3,B0001US67I,"""Miracle,"" a story of the 1980 gold-medal winning U.S. Hockey Team, rolls its opening credits over an impressive montage of the 15 years leading up the Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. - Vietnam, Watergate, the oil crisis, disco - that promises to reveal an understanding of how the team's unlikely upset of the Soviet Union delivered the nation an optimism lost during the Nixon/Ford/Carter eras.
But writer Eric Guggenheim and director Gavin O'Connor only occasionally revisit that theme, and just as ""Remember The Titans"" eventually morphed into a romp-n-stomp football picture - clothesline hits, last-minute heroics - ""Miracle"" is content to end as a goal-by-goal sports drama - the mystery and method of victory having been removed over time by seemingly weekly ESPN features - and as a character study of the team's coach, Herb Brooks, a stoic who funneled his creativity into weave plays.
There is a reason coach portraits are generally on the dry side. Coaches are generally dry men. And Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, was arid and driven - shunning the U.S. Olympic committee in crafting his team, relegating his assistant (Noah Emmerich) to a whistle-blowing stooge, applying mind tricks to his blue collar squad of players. Russell gets inside Brooks - his tics, body language and ""Fargo"" accent - to create a decent, winning man, repressed but ambitious, given to celebrating (or genuflecting or even smiling) in private. Brooks' moral rectitude makes for an education - ""Miracle"" is built for the family library - but the movie is workmanlike and stodgy, too. Were Patricia Clarkson not on hand as ""the wife"" to jazz up scenes - Clarkson raises domestic performance to a kind of art - Brooks would emerge as an anti-hero.
""Miracle"" charts the maturity of Brooks' vision, which is to craft a team as the Russians would, on Communist principles - submerging the I for the team, group punishment for individual discretion, a fiendish devotion to sport. ""I'm not looking for the best players,"" he says. ""I'm looking for the right ones."" Socialism fails as a government but not as an ethic of sports organization, and the Russians won four consecutive gold medals honing that theory. Brooks goes so far as to make his team unavailable for interviews at the Olympics, although the savior of those Winter Games, goalie Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), staved off one Russian slapshot after another, opening the door for the Americans to attack the Soviets with a similar offense and deserved at least as much credit as Brooks did, having played nearly every minute for seven months leading into the Lake Placid.
The movie's turning point arrives early: After a subpar performance in Norway, Brooks hauls his team back onto the ice and skates them to exhaustion. Director O'Connor takes a risk here, dragging the scene out beyond all cinematic purpose for a thematic one: Brooks yells ""again"" well after we would have expected ""enough,"" and yet this gamble works, playing against expectations. Unlike ""Seabiscuit,"" crisply edited into two-minute chunks yet shallow for the choice, Miracle"" makes its stand as the lights go out and Brooks nods once more for the whistle. It is the best ten minutes of the film.
""Miracle"" employs broadcaster Al Michaels, who announced the original game, to provide voiceover  - it doesn't sound like play-by-play, but canned narration (the movie not-so-subtly shifts to his original ""Do you believe in Miracles? Yes!"" call near the end of the U.S. victory). The hockey scenes are fast and violent, but indistinct; about all we can really gather is that Craig made an enormous number of saves.",1086048000,3,3621,5.035

Cast:  Kurt Russell, Patricia Clarkston, Noah Emmerich, Sean McCann, Kenneth Welsh, Eddie Cahill, Patrick O'Brien Dempsey, Michael Mantenuto.
Running Time:  136 minutes.
Rated PG for some foul language, but film is suitable for entire family.
Although possessing the all-too-similar theme conveyed in all of our society's most popular sports films (such as ""Rudy"", ""Remember the Titans"", ""Hoosiers"", and ""Rocky""), the underdog is the easiest character or team to relate to, the only way to root, and the defining winner that is supposed to inspire all of us to strive for the most unreachable, unbelievable goals because ""darn it, if they could do it, why can't I?"".  ""Miracle"" is no exception, but the reason for its success like the above-mentioned motion pictures is simple-great acting and some excellent sports footage.
""Miracle"" stages the incredible story set in 1980 about the over-achieving United States hockey team that shocks the unblemished, dominant Soviet Union squad in the semifinal match of the Olympic tournament (this is certainly not a spoiler; it was one of the most publicized sporting events of the past quarter century).  Kurt Russell is excellent as the hard-nosed head coach Herb Brooks, who is determined to take this group of ragtag college hockey jocks to the brink of success because of his own personal misfortune at the Games twenty years before.  With his wife (Patricia Clarkston) at his side, Brooks toughens up his group of players as no other coach would dare-putting them through grinding drills, making them skate for hours, and proving to them that being a cohesive team is much more important than talent alone.
The film is exceptionally directed by Gavin O'Connor, who brilliantly links the importance of the win against the Soviet Union with the awful Cold War taking place that had a terror-grip on the world.  ""Miracle"" has only one major flaw-with all the attention on Brooks, there is little characterization of the rest of the supporting cast (namely the players).  While there is emphasis on the troubled goalie (Cahill), many other deserving participants are not dually represented in the picture.  With this set aside, ""Miracle"" is a great story that has been told time and time again, but not usually with this much flair and emotion.  A suitable presentation for all ages, it is a film that not only stages some excellent hockey sequences and fine performances, but historically conveys the horrors that political hatred can bring, only to show that hard work and hope can win over all.",1085529600,,2565,5.13189448441247

Kurt Russell is great as Minnesotan Herb Brooks.  He's a tough coach who does in his own way with hockey players of his choosing.  All of the players do a superb job on and off the ice.  None of the kids are well known actors, but they might be someday.  The development of the team chemistry is fun to watch.

2024978,4,B0001US67I,"In 1980, at the Winter Olympic  Games in Lake Placid, NY, the American men's ice hockey team, comprised of young college players, took on the best ice hockey team in the world, the Soviet Union's, and won. The U.S. men's team went on to win Olympic  Gold that year, for the first time since 1960. I remember watching that game. I wasn't a fan of ice hockey, but neither were most of the viewers glued to their television sets. Only someone living in isolation could have been unaware of the U.S. men's hockey team's unexpected performance at the Olympic Games that year. They had earned a spot in the medal round, against the Soviet Union. This was just as the Cold War was  heating up. The U.S.S.R. had invaded Afghanistan. Americans were being held hostage in Iran. There was a  feeling of national malaise. A young hockey team with more heart than experience had become unlikely heroes, at least in the minds and hearts of Americans. Even so, no one expected them to beat the Soviet Union. We only hoped they would put up a good fight. But win they did, in one of the most memorable televised sporting events ever. ""Miracle"" is a dramatization of that team's journey to the Olympic  games and it's triumphant conclusion twenty-four years ago. I wonder what took Hollywood so long.

Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) is the hero of the story. He had coached the University of Minnesota Men's Ice Hockey team to 3 NCAA championships when he was hired to coach the U.S. Olympic  team. He proposed to employ a  hybrid of the Soviet and Canadian styles of play, and to rely on teamwork instead of individual talent. The U.S. team had nothing to lose after several dismal Olympic  performances, so they hired him. He spent only one day assembling the right players. And he trained them longer and harder than seemed reasonable to accomplish what seemed unreasonable: to win.

""Miracle"" is shot in the color palette, and to some degree the style, of 1970s cinema, which gives the film a  nice period air. The climactic  hockey game, however, employs more modern cinematographic  and editing techniques, which help make it exciting. ""Miracle"" spends a lot of time on that game, and director Gavin O'Conner, cinematographer Dan Stoloff, and editor John Gilroy deserve praise for making it suspenseful, even for those of us who remember  the real thing. Kurt Russell splendidly transforms himself into a middle-aged, stoic, stubborn and very determined Coach Brooks. Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich turn in very nice supporting performances as Brooks' wife Patti and the team's assistant coach Craig Patrick, respectively. There is an awful lot of training footage in this film, some of which should have been cut to trim some length off of ""Miracle""'s slightly bloated two hours and ten minutes. But this is still a nice film. The first half is a little sluggish, although informative. The pacing improves in the second half, and the final hockey game exhibits a lot of skill and delivers a lot of excitement.",1085097600,9,3006,4.8229571984435795

The actual event was a three-game series played in February, 1979, in place of the league's annual All-Star Game.  It was won by the Soviets 2 games to 1, with the final game being the aforementioned 6-0 result.
Since Herb Brooks was named coach of the team in June 79, there is no way he could have been watching that sportscast showing highlights of the game at the airport with his team.
Other than this blunder, the film was pretty good, utilizing real hockey players rather than actors to play hockey players.  This gives the hockey scenes (and there are plenty) much credibility.

They didn't expand much into the Finland game, which was the actual gold medal winning game.  Historians seem to always neglect that game.  It is a shame too, because if we don't win that game, we don't win gold.  And what was up with the gray Finland jerseys?  In the real game they wore white.  The Finnish Ice Hockey Federation must not have given permission to use the exact jersey.",1084924800,4,1368,4.424

2024993,4,B0001US67I,"""Miracle"" is like any other sport movie. The only difference that sets them apart is that their triumph is a remarkable true story. What can only be conceived from the minds of Hollywood is actually the story of the 1980 U.S.A. Olympic hockey team that shocked the world by defeating the insurmountable Russians in the semi-finals, known as ""the miracle on ice,"" and then finishing off Finland for the coveted gold medal. ""Miracle"" is a typical sport movie but it still succeeds because it avoids most sport clichs.
Another positive note to ""Miracle"" is that they treat the game of hockey pretty straight forward. The drills and games are shot realistically with no fanciful things. The opposing teams do not have a unique personality but simply ordinary players like the U.S.A. team with an urge to win. Nothing is ever overdone. Moreover, even though we know the fate of the team and the games, the movie does a fabulous job in maintaining suspense. What the movie does do a bad job on is that it knows where it is heading but leaves the audience behind. What stage are they in? What is the importance of this game? Are they qualifying or are they already in there? These were the sorts of question that I asked myself during the courses of their game.
In spite of all the clichs and mismanagement of certain plot points, Kurt Russell alone is worth the price of admission. It is always fascinating to see an obsessive coach but even more intriguing knowing that he is a real person. ""Miracle"" certainly is a feel-good movie and it will leave a proud grin in your face. With the wonderful performance of Kurt Russell and a director (Gavin O'Connor) that did his best in directing an original film based on clichs, it is no ""miracle"" that this movie succeeds.",1084838400,,1760,4.662379421221865
2024994,5,B0001US67I,"I had seen the HBO documentary about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team and heard a lot of interviews from the actual players.  When I was told a movie was being made I could hardly wait until February 2004 to see it.  It is amazing how exact the movie is in comparison to the documentary.  And yes, like many others, I also teared up when the announcer counted down the last few seconds and then proclaimed those famous words...""Do you believe in miracles...yes!""  The director did an excellent job.  I am anxiously awaiting my copy of Miracle...which my brother is getting me for my birthday.",1084838400,,591,4.59047619047619
2024995,5,B0001US67I,"This is a fantastic movie, especially for those who saw the game back in 1980 and know how big of a deal it really was. I can see how younger people may not really get it. And now with millionaire pros playing in the Olympics it is impossible for something this inspirational to ever happen again.
The perfect DVD extra would have been to include the actual game. I taped it a few years ago from ESPN classic and have written to ESPN to request that they put it out on DVD. I don't understand why they don't. If they had packaged it with 'Miracle' they would sell tens of thousands more copies of it. This is one of the greatest marketing blunders of all time.",1084838400,4,660,4.246031746031746
2024996,4,B0001US67I,"Being a hockey player I went into this movie a little biased and knew I was going to like it no matter what, and I did.  Though I was fairly young at the time this event took place it's nice to know that I can say that I was around when it happened.
Even though you know what the outcome of the final game is going to be, the moive makers did a very good job of creating the suspense of the slow moving clock in the last game.  I'm a little dissappointed in the ending and how they just kind of glossed over the Gold Medal game against Finland like it was less important.  There was probably just as much drama in that game that could've been shown as there was in the USA vs USSR game.
If you ever get a chance, watch the HBO documentary special on the 1980 USA hockey team.  That has interviews with Herb Brooks and a handful of the players and press people from both sides.  It brings tears to my eyes each time I see the US players discribing for themselves how they beat the Soviets.  In the HBO special, Herb Brooks talks about being cut from the 1960 USA hockey team at the last hours before the Olympics and how he was sitting with his Dad watching the US win the gold.  His dad turned to him and said ""It looks like the cut the right guy"".
To me, a little flash back in the beginning of the movie showing that would have really played up that stoyline better then the 1980 players just talking about it the locker room.",1084838400,,1428,4.096774193548387
2024997,5,B0001US67I,"Kurt Russell is absolutely amazing.  They(the directors) made you feel like Herb Brooks was sitting in the room with you.  It was so intense, motivating, it's not just for hockey players or hockey teams, but you could use it if you we're a teacher and your kids weren't responding well to a task.  Show them this movie(it's O.K. it's PG) and they will respond better than they ever did before.  It's a life changing movie.
My Hockey Team was losing bad... I went to see this movie with my girlfriend, the next night I told all the guys we should see it together.  We did and from that point on we went undefeated and made they playoffs.  Something that looked so out of reach the night before, was suddenly there!  Go get this movie immediatly.",1084838400,,744,4.466666666666667
2024998,5,B0001US67I,"Disney just has some magical touch with hockey movies.  Miracle was fantastic.  In just over 2 hours, they show a great progression, from the drive and motivation of Herb Brooks bringing together a unique lineup of players (several who greatly dislike each other) and mold them into a team like no other.  The hockey action is top notch, and you will find yourself cheering along at the end.  This is a movie for everyone, and everyone should see it!",1084752000,,450,4.658227848101266
2024999,5,B0001US67I,"The movie is great even if you aren't familiar with story.  It is one of the greatest underdog stories ever.  It's like a College team beating the Bulls with Jordan, or the Lakers with Magic and Kareem.  Plus add in the problems we had with the Russian government at the time.
I agree with schoduck that the actual game when they beat the Russians should be on this DVD or at least available.  There is a DVD with some highlights and too much commentary.  The Russian team beat our NHL all-star teams and crushed the Olympic team prior to the Olympics in 1980.  The movie is very good too bad coach Herb Brooks died before it was released.  I was a 9 year old when the US won, and it still blows me away to this day.  The only way the accomplishment could have been surpassed is if it was the Gold medal game.",1084752000,,809,4.207792207792208
2025000,5,B0001US67I,"5 stars for the movie and all aspects so nuff said.  How about the actual game itself?  I managed to tape the game several years after the Olympics but would really love to see this out on DVD.  How about it, ABC?  How about it, fans?  What can we do to bring the actual game to DVD?",1083542400,5,283,3.8947368421052633
2025001,5,B0001US67I,"I took three little girls with almost no interest in hockey to see this movie. I'm a crazy hockey fan and a film buff, so to say that I loved it probably isn't going to convince anyone. One of the girls, a very opinionated nine-year-old, told me before we saw it, ""I don't know about hockey because there's too much smashing!""  By the end of the film, though, she was cheering like she was at a real hockey game. The next time I saw her, she announced, ""I'm going to see Miracle again because I liked it so much!  Jack O'Callahan was my favorite because he came right out and knocked the other guy over!""
Not that I'm advocating children enjoying violence, but I think that shows that this movie isn't just for hockey buffs. I was definitely impressed with the realism--the boys playing the hockey team were all real-life players, so there were no long shots of stunt doubles, and yet they were all thoroughly convincing actors as well. ""Miracle"" is up there with the best sports movies ever made, and can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.",1083369600,2,1042,4.478947368421053
2025002,5,B0001US67I,"To Nemo the Clown Fish, your review is revolting.  I was there when it happened.  As a young amature hockey player from Minnesota, I can only say how fortunate I am.  Prior to the 1980 Olympics, I had the privledge of being on the ice with Bob Sutter and Ken Morrow.  They came down and practiced with us.  As a 12 year old kid at the time, these guys were bigger to me than the NHL.  Herb Brooks took a group of college kids to the Olympics to beat the Russian national team, mind you, a professional team.  Oh, back to the movie.  A great hockey film, a breath of fresh air after Slap Shot II.  The movie not only shows you the highs of being on a great team, but all the hard work and dedication it takes to get there.  No actor alive today could have pulled of the stellar performance of Kurt Russell.  Hat's off to Disney, I give this 6 stars.  And to Nemo the Clown Fish, I guess the announcer's words ""Do you belive in miracles"" at the end of the final game, your answer was NO.  Some day you will grow up and see that life is much more important than a cartoon.",1082419200,6,1069,4.057416267942584
2025003,5,B0001US67I,"As a hockey player, realism was the most important thing for me.  I had heard that the realism was exceptional, so I had high expectations for it, all of which were exceded.  By casting hockey players, they made this movie as realistic as possible.  The history is also amazingly accurate, Mike Eruzioni's transformation from long-shot to captian, all the way to the infamous ""Brooksisms.""  A must see for anyone, hockey fan or not.",1081728000,5,432,4.876712328767123
2025004,5,B0001US67I,"As a Minnesotan, and a lover of hockey, this subject is near and dear to my heart.  Let that be a disclaimer -- I'm a bit biased.  Miracle is, of course, the story of the 1980 ""Miracle on Ice"", when a smaller, more inexperienced U.S. team upset the Soviets to go on to the gold medal round against Finland.  This is the event that ESPN determined to be the greatest sporting moment of the twentieth century.  The movie is exceedingly true to the events that took place -- from Herb Brooks' exclusion of everything in his life except hockey, to the way Eruzione danced down the ice after scoring the game winner that would put the U.S. up 4-3 with 10 minutes left to play.  The filmmakers, though, make the movie more that just hockey -- they put the movie into a historical context by showing us news clips (subtly and not-so-subtly) including things like the Iran Hostage Crisis, they put two characters in a car in a line waiting for gas, the styles, the music, even the language reflects 1979-1980.  Rather than resort to body doubles, they found hockey players who had the ability to act, which lends a great deal of realism to the scenes on the ice.  The characters are done decently, though they seem to focus largely on Mike Eruzione and Jim Craig (the goalie), perhaps because their stories are the ones that really stand out.  The movie will run you the gamut of emotions -- laughter to tears, and in the end is worth watching repeatedly, just to experience the joy of hockey.
The only thing they could do to make this DVD package better than the materials it includes is to package the actual game on DVD with it.  (I was fortunate enough to catch it on ESPN Classic the night before seeing the movie, which only gave me more appreciation for the quality of the film.)",1080864000,,1778,4.479876160990712
2025005,5,B0001US67I,"Miracle truly is a wonderful and inspirational movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone else.  What is so inspiring about the movie is how it illustrates that a goal is achieved through dedication (emphasized memorably by Kurt Russell as coach Herb Brooks) and lots of hard work (shown by the players).  This is definitely a great story, supported by related sub-stories and lots of exciting action.

There are lots of good points about this movie, but a couple things that I liked about it were 1. the producers didn't jam unnecessary, distracting elements into the movie- they stuck to the real story; 2. they made an excellent decision to find real hockey players who could act, rather than try to teach actors how to play hockey.  That really adds a lot to the authenticity of the movie.  All of the hockey players did an OUTSTANDING job, all the more outstanding because most of them have not acted before.  And, fortunately, all of them are likable, though different (ex. O'Callahan and McClanahan are pretty hot-tempered, while Jim Craig is a little more aloof and easygoing, and Eruzione is definitely the ""nice guy,"" making him my favorite).  I hope we see some of them again in future movies.
Even though you know the United States wins at the end, this movie will still carry you through a variety of emotions: you cry, you laugh, you tense, you cheer, and you feel proud of the team and the wonderful nation they represented!",1080691200,,1441,4.74
