8198220,3,B000QYJG1Y,The movie was great but the sound track was off. We could not here the actors speaking but the music sound track was loud. Thank God for subtitles so we could read what they were saying.,1476316800,,186,4.194444444444445
8198221,2,B000QYJG1Y,"Akshaye and Kareena and the handsome Sunil and the other actors were so engaging but this was a hard movie to watch and I wouldn't see it again. Trying to be slapstick at times, but based on hate between two families. The hard part was it was full of threats of hacking and cutting and all this horrible stuff, to kill family members, kill the daughter, kill the son, for being in love or whoever, if they did this or that, and believing themselves to mean it but even we didn't believe them really. Then trying to weave a love story through that. You suppose by the end somehow the mean hearts will melt between the horrible feuding families, and all will be reconciled which often happens in a story like this in Indian movies, but at one point I didn't even want to watch anymore. Maybe because of the actors, I did end up watching til the end, but it was stomach-wrenching and I would have been better off to not even see it, regardless how it turned out. Overall a total waste of great actors in my view, but it was them and only them that kept me watching. Some sweet scenes between Akshaye and Kareena & some scenery & sets, no actual bloodshed but a woman getting slapped and fist-fights. Only glad I saw it because I had been curious, now I know.",1465776000,,1255,4.322033898305085
8198222,3,B000QYJG1Y,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS OKAY.  IT WAS KIND OF GRAINY, AND THE VOLUME FOR THE SPEAKING PART WAS SOFT AND THE PARTS OF THE FIGHT SCENES WAS LOUD.  IT'S OKAY AND I PROBABLY WON'T PURCHASE A DVD COPY.",1442188800,,197,4.0256410256410255
8198223,5,B000QYJG1Y,This was the first Hindi movie I ever watched and was so glad to finally have it again to watch!,1384041600,,96,3.85
8198224,2,B000QYJG1Y,"I decided to rewatch this movie in case I was just too tired to appreciate it.  I love slapstick, or  witty depending on my mood. I love adventure ,romance comedy etc etc. but I just couldn't get past the huge holes in the story and the fact that the time frame was such that all the characters could of had their own stories. It would of made for a far better experience for me. The contrived lines for the female character , the incessant overbearing horrific cartoon parents had me to the point of a feeling suffocated but with no relief.

 THE ACTORS WERE AND ARE FINE ACTORS..but how can you tell the CHARACTERS were worth giving a crap about if you are never given any reasons to want to cheer for them. The cow scene very funny. The climbing through the window scene good. The fake courtship not as funny as it could be but at least it didn't drag. The wedding scene pretty good. Maybe 40 min in all of this time for entertainment , the rest just left gasping for air and I don't mean holding my ribs laughing. Which brings me to: Next up on my list of don't please don't do it I BEG OF YOU.....NOOOOOO... yep you guessed it.  The pathetic, incessant, sound effects laden, punch 10 feet from the face,  phonier than phony FIGHT SCENES TO NOWHERE. Then I couldn't stop laughing (((fight scenes are great for slapstick or thrilling well done stunts but constant phony ones just drag down the movie, it's just overdone and stupid )))). Then I couldn't STOP laughing, oh the agony. Use that time on real character investment and I would of been THRILLED to watch this movie. Instead I was motivated by the "" I paid for it and by God I'm going to get my moneys worth and lets be fair and watch it again before it expires just to  re-evaluate it "". I have come to like Akshay Khanna. I just don't like this movie.

This film had a lot of potential. Passion and rage can drive a well written script when fleshing out a story. The writer/director won't let you grow with these people because until the last 45 seconds of the movie you are not allowed to grow in any way shape or form. SORRY ...I Still hate it the second time. Hul Chul and I will just have to remain total opposites for all eternity.",1330732800,,2199,4.3075060532687655
8198225,4,B000QYJG1Y,"Priyadarshan's Hulchul is a great entertainer. Like his earlier film Hungama, this one will also have you in splits. There are a lot of great actors in the film. Starting with Akshay Khanna, Kareena Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Amrish Puri, Arshad Warsi and many more.

Arshad Warsi is hilarious, he picks up where he left off in Munna Bhai MBBS. His character is well etched and has you laughing every time he's on the screen. Paresh Rawal is great as usual.

Akshaye Kumar and Kareena Kapoor have great on screen chemistry its clearly visible in the song ""Rafta Rafta"". They fit their roles like a glove. Jackie Shroff and Suniel Shetty are good as usual.

Sadly, this is one of Amrish Puri's last performances, but he does a great job. He will be sorely missed and remembered forever!",1304035200,,810,4.7304964539007095
8198226,5,B000QYJG1Y,"What more than fun can you expect with the witty nature of Arshad Warsi and the intelligent comedic/romantic side of Akshaye khanna? A riotous tale full of laughter, intrigue, and forbidden romance. Love Akshaye Khanna.",1253664000,,219,5.285714285714286
8198227,4,B000QYJG1Y,"I usually don't like Bollywood comedies as they are often over-the-top, have silly characters and emphasize slapstick. This is quite different. The acting is sharp and understated - so much done with raised eyebrows and good use of facial expression. The scripting is good too - though it lagged a little in one section towards the end.

The plot? - Two families have been warring for a long time. One is headed by a strong conniving grandmother and the other by a fierce grandfather (Amrish Puri) who rules over his 4 sons and forbids them ever marrying or bringing a woman even into their compound.
Grandma hatches a plot to have her granddaughter (Kareena Kapoor) get a son from the other clan to fall in love with her with a view to then separating and humiliating the other clan. The girl obediently starts playing out the plan. The son (Akshaye Khanna) resists at first but his friend suggests he play along and use the girl to split the other clan. Of course in both playing along they do fall in love so are the going to be able to marry and will they even keep their lives with the fierce relatives on both sides...? (btw while there are quite a few fights this is a comedy and you can probably guess what the outcome is).

A lot of the movies success is not just the direction and scripting but a very mature strong cast. Kareena and Akshaye are so well cast as the love duo who are deliciously mischievous with each other initially then settle into their romantic roles well. I have really warmed to Akshaye whose work is getting better and better  (and who has lost the scowl/smile he used to have). Then there are the strong elders, Sunil Shetty, Jackie Shroff, Paresh Rawal and others who are similarly beautifully timed in their performances.

The songs and dances are fine though I didn't depart singing them! I really enjoyed this one. Its probably a 4 - 4 1/2 for me. Elsewhere on the Net it tends to be seen as average to above average e.g. 5-7 out of 10. This is a keeper for me.",1238112000,,1999,4.453551912568306
