1681440,4,B000060MX9,"As I started watching ""Lemonade Joe"" it was clear the film was a Czechoslovakian spoof of Hollywood westerns, with a heavy influence from silent films that were obsessed with tinting.  However, I kept having the feel that there was perhaps some deeper socialist satire of the decadent west going on here.  Of course, once I paid attention and discovered this film by director Oldrich Lipsky was released in the United States in 1966 (but filmed two years earlier), clarity descended upon me.  This would have been two years before Soviet tanks rolled into Prague, which means ""Lemonade Joe"" might be propaganda, but it affection for the West dressed up as a socialist satire.  I know it makes you head hurt to think of such things, but that is pretty much what we have here.
Lemonade Joe is the name of our white haired hero, played by Carl Fiala.  Joe earned his name because he refuses to drink liquor when he saunters into the local saloon, the Trigger Whiskey Saloon, where bad girl Tornado Lou sings tawdry songs of love.  Fortunately Joe is the best shot around, so nobody picks on him for long.  The plot basically exaggerates every single western cliche you can come up, which is evident as soon as you find out the names of the characters.  There are dance hall girls with hearts of gold, mustache twirling villains, and the mystery of what happened to Joe's family when that hurricane blew them all to the four corners of the Earth.  Hogo Fogo is the lecherous villain, who wants to destroy Joe and win the affections of Winnifred, the virgin temperance advocate played by Playboy covergirl Olga Schoberova.  Lipsky, a graduate of Prague's Satirical Theatre sets up all the bits and pieces, but then does not have a clear idea of what to do next.  Then suddenly, a happy ending emerges and the film ends with a general reconciliation that transcends even death (even death caused by a corkscrew).
True, ""Lemonade Joe"" is unable to sustain its initial moment, but besides ""Airplane"" few satires do successfully.  This one is of great interest simply because it shows us how American Westerns were viewed in Eastern Europe.  After all, you have to know the rules to be able to do a successful spoof.  The cast of this 84-minute film includes Kveta Fialova, Rudolf Deyl, Karel Effa, Karel Gott, and Josef Hlinomaz.  The Czech title for this film was ""Lemonade Joe a Horse Opera.""  This film, which won the Silver Seashell at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, is one of five Czech New Wave films released by Facets Video.",1013904000,11,2540,4.751708428246014

7957453,5,B000060MX9,"Ever since I saw it for the first time in my childhood in communist Poland l always liked this 1964 surrealistic Czechoslovak comedy, parodying mercilessly but so skilfully the old westerns from the 20s and 30s. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In a lawless town, filled with scum and villainy, the most successful business is Trigger Whiskey Saloon, owned by a certain Doug Badman (Rudolf Deyl), an ignoble scoundrel who happens to be also the producer and distributor of Trigger Whiskey, a horribly potent (and certainly toxic) but cheap liquor, more or less an imitation of real whiskey... He is seconded by an obscenely ugly, repugnant and not very bright desperado, Gunslinger Grimpo, a.k.a. Old Pistol (Josef Hlinomaz). Another attraction of the Trigger Whiskey Saloon is a gorgeously voluptuous raven haired singer, Tornado Lou (Kveta Fialova), who probably committed every sin in the book - but still refuses to sleep with her boss...

The population of the town spends all the money in Trigger Whiskey Saloon and refuses to even hear the calls for temperance and other virtues preached by the hapless Reverend Ezra Goodman (Bohus Zahorsky) and his immaculately virginal blond daughter Winnifred (Olga Schoberova). But all this changes when a stranger clad in shining white clothes arrives to town - his name is Lemonade Joe (Karel Fiala), he is an invincible gunfighter and the secret of his invincibility resides in his total abstinence. He drinks only a healthy lemonade known as Kolaloka and with the support of Goodman family he opens in the town a new, totally alcohol free joint.

Doug Badman's business quickly declines - however, when he is already preparing to leave town, a new stranger arrives, a well (and darkly) dressed, perfectly groomed and gentlemanly mannered prestidigitator/gunman/poker player known as Hogofogo (Milos Kopecky), a villain infinitely more villainous than anything previously known in the Wild West... For reasons of his own he is willing to help Doug Badman in his confrontation with Lemonade Joe. And then the film really begins...

Czech cinema is known in the West mostly for the serious dramas, like ""Loves of a blonde"" and ""Closely watched trains"". Czech comedies on another hand are virtually terra incognita for the Western public and it is a pity, because many of them are absolute treasures: ""Four Murders Are Enough, Darling"" (1970), ""I Killed Einstein, Gentlemen"" (1970), ""How to Drown Dr. Mracek, the Lawyer"" (1975), ""Marecek, Pass Me the Pen!"" (1976), ""Dinner for Adele"" (1977) and ""Waiter, scarper!"" (1980). To that list must be added also the absolutely classical adaptations of Jaroslav Hasek novels, ""The Good Soldier Schweik"" (1956) and ""I dutifully report"" (1957). ""Lemonade Joe or the Horse Opera"" is therefore in good company, as one of the best comedies in a cinema which really, REALLY knew how to make them!

This is a comedy and even if some critics tried to find in it some hidden depths and messages, in fact there is hardly any - this is almost pure entertainment, of the most irreverent and anarchic kind, with burlesque and grotesque struggling for dominancy in every single scene. Already the very idea of trying to sell abstinence to Czech viewers, whose birthplace build its identity mostly on those twin pillars that are Pilsner and Budweiser, is a highly hilarious endeavour. ALMOST nothing is serious in this film and the one and only serious thing is itself a joke - I will come to it in a moment...

Technically the film looks quite a lot like the earliest westerns - it is a black and white thing, with accelerated fights and horse riding and the frequently exaggerated acting, seeming to come from mute films. Also as in many mute comedies the main character accomplishes some obviously impossible stunts and like in musicals, when he sings occasionally all his enemies wait patiently for him to finish...

The irreverent and anarchic character of this film comes mostly from the fact that if the villains are quite naturally ridiculed, the ""good guys"" are not spared either, maybe with the exception of Reverend Goodman, whose screen time is however quite limited. Lemonade Joe himself hides a secret and even if he is 97,5% of disinterested goodness, he still wants his reasonable and probably well deserved cut of benefits. As for the angelic Winnifred, her eagerness to be freed from the burden of her virginity is absolutely hilarious...))) The villains themselves are full of surprises, not the least of which are the spiritual (and also a little bit carnal) torments of Tornado Lou, the ""fallen woman"" who falls for the pure hero... The final revelations and the final fate of almost everybody in this film achieves to put to grave any pretention to seriousness - even more easily so, as that part of the film happens in a cemetery...)))

The accumulation of revelations and twists in the great finale, with every next one being more outrageous than the precedent, is completely over the top and hilarious but paradoxically this is also the one (short) moment in which this film becomes a little more serious. It must be kept in mind, that even if communist Czechoslovakia was economically rather more successful than most of Eastern Bloc, it was nevertheless an oppressive dictatorship, in which every single film, book, song etc. had to be approved by official censorship office. Also, in order to get funds to make films, directors and screenwriters had frequently to include official propaganda, part of which was the condemnation of capitalism and criticism of American life style and values. Seemingly, the makers of this film obliged the communist authorities, even obliged them very much - but in reality the sheer accumulation of such a number of ""anti-capitalist"" elements, showed in such a cheesy way and in such a rapid succession completely reversed the effect...)))

The final result is that the makers of this film pulled a fast one on communist censorship, turning in ridicule the ""official line"" of propaganda, with the authorities being the only ones to not notice that - unlike everybody else...))) I do not blame the communist authorities too much however for missing that point, because, to my enormous surprise, after reading some reviews and articles concerning ""Lemonade Joe"", some left-oriented Western viewers also took all this to the face value and actually sincerely believe that this merry anarchic comedy is a ""denunciation of capitalism, consumerism and American way of life, religion included"" ...))) ...))) ...)))

Bottom line, this is a very amusing, very unusual, hilarious, surrealistic, over the top and (almost) completely not serious and extremely well made horse opera..., err, I mean western comedy...))) I recommend it with all my heart and I am totally keeping my DVD for another viewing. ENJOY!",1430179200,5,6858,5.088
7957454,5,B000060MX9,"This is a Czech spaghetti Western from 1964, one of the greatest movies of all time!  It is full of witty dialogues, clever satire and wonderful cinematography.  It is much more than just a spoof of Hollywood westerns -- the movie also does a wonderful job of social criticism of many aspects of Western society.  Particularly what happens to laws, government, community, public good, etc. when money is at stake.  The fun and lighthearted approach (the movie's full title is ""Lemonade Joe or Horse opera"" -- and they do horse around) make the satire truly enjoyable.

The hero Joe (pronounced Yo-eh) is the fastest gun in the West and never misses his target.  While he enforces the law and defends the common good as he travels across the West, he is also a sales rep for his father's company selling Kola Loka.  Then he arrives in a frontier town of Stetson City where the Badman brothers (Doug and Horace) run the Trigger Whiskey Saloon.  The two sides spar most of the movie with guns, fists, singing (yes, you also have to spoof the musicals) but also -- and more importantly in marketing and advertising to promote their business.  For as it often goes in our Western world, the common good is where the money is....

In the end, and against all odds, Joe defeats the Badman brothers and as a bonus gets the pretty girl.  Of course, before they get engaged the two lovebirds negotiate over the percentage of profits from the Kola Loka company that the bride is to receive.  To make the satire complete, the Badman brothers turn out to be Joe's long last brothers (lost in a tornado before Joe was born) as all the children from Joe's family have a birthmark on their forearm of the size of the Mexican dollar.  Anyway, upon this news Joe's father accepts the Badman brothers back into the fold, saying that there is room and need in the family business even for their kind and especially with their experience.

There are many great actors in the movie who truly perform brilliantly in this movie.  Whether it's Karel Fiala as Joe or Milos Kopecky as Horace Badman a.k.a. Hogo Fogo or Hana Hegerova as the bad girl Tornado Lou this is a great cast!  Even many supporting actors such as Josef Hlinomaz, who chews up a violin as one of the toughest guys in the West, they all deserve a big thumb up.

Brilliant and very funny.",1311811200,4,2331,4.564903846153846

Surprisingly enjoyable and engaging, Lemonade Joe is, to this fan of Westerns of all eras, one of the finest genre satires I've ever seen. It might even be funnier than Blazing Saddles.

Lemonade Joe starts as a spoof of silent Westerns, but it quickly becomes clear that Director Lipsky was a fan of Hollywood in general, as well as the newer crop of Westerns in the early 60s, and his satirical pistol fans out to take down these and many more subjects. From sepiatone to blue/white to color and back and forth; shifting angles and odd shots that presage some of Leone's spaghetti-western work (was he a fan of Lipsky?); mocking various cinematic cliches; and simultaneously deriding and celebrating many facets of the Bourgeois Capitalist West that some Czechs in 1964 clearly had much affection for, even before they were sucked into the USSR nightmare. The Puritan ethos juxtaposed with the frontier mentality, the patent medicine craze morphing into icons like Koka Kola, and so many more ironies are examined with tongue in cheek. No preaching, just amusement, and the fine musical score and visual sophistication hold it all together.

The whole film gives off an aura of love for all the things it satirizes, and that attention to detail as well as the one culture's eye for another's absurdities combine to make a truly unique movie that's a treat to watch.

I must say I'm jealous of those reviewers here who saw it back in the 60s with dubbing. Normally I prefer subtitles and hearing the original voice inflection (and the Czech and French here is sweetly mellifluous), but I was longing for some really good voices on this from the early 60s; Mel Blanc could have been the bad guy! The movie is so ripe for that What's Up, Tiger Lily? treatment that Woody did just two years after this.

Sooner or later Lemonade Joe will get the wider attention it deserves.
It should be on any Film Humor 101 syllabus, as it's much more than just a good spoof.",1245283200,3,1970,4.715116279069767
7957456,5,B000060MX9,"My husband and I watched this movie on late night TV many years ago, and laughed ourselves silly.  What a treat it was to find it again, and laugh myself silly again, although sadly, all by myself this time. It is a great satire of our American Western movies and our commercial obsessions, as seen from outside.",1243382400,4,312,4.473684210526316
7957457,5,B000060MX9,"I just can't fathom how this is being treated as a ""spoof on Westerns"" when it's actually an overt and uproarious spoof on the West--one that would almost certainly work well with the Michael Moore crowd, except I doubt they would have ever encountered anything so perceptive AND so much fun before (and so well-scripted and crafted).

American directors who attempt this sort of social and political satire tend to sacrifice lightness-of-touch for over-earnest political point-making; in American hands a satire like Lemonade Joe would have eventually descended into un-funny grinding blackness or overreachings at profundity. Americans (like Moore) think that killing the fun is making the ""point."" I'm thinking of awful films like ""C.S.A."" and even Moore's ""Canadian Bacon.""  Lemonade Joe is an excellent example of how to do engaging social criticism.

While watching it I also felt myself dearly missing the Commies. They were superb opponents for the West, consistently and accurately pointing out the flaws and hypocrisies of Western political and economic systems. Unlike the modern Left and the Politically Correct they believed in the idea of progress and made no apologies for cultures they saw as ""backward""--Commies couldn't be cultural relativists. They also maintained Western intellectual traditions, finding their roots in their own cultural history. Again, they were incapable of throwing the cultural baby out with the bath-water, as many modern West-hating Leftists now do. Only a good Commie could have made a flick this good.

[Oddly, mainstream Hollywood often did a much better job at fun social criticism. Wilder's ""One,Two,Three"" immediately comes to mind and that film would be an appropriate companion to Lemonade Joe]",1179532800,5,1746,5.455555555555556

How it was the greatist satire of the American western movies.  I have laughed soooo much over the years and it has been the source of many good laughs as I told others about it.  When I recently purchased it I realized over the years that I had mis-remembered (?} many things. I had forgotten that it was sub-titled and I had to watch very carefully what was being said.  My memories about the different colored filters were not exact, but very close.  All in all my memories were pretty good and it was still a hilarious spoof after 35 years... I still love the film for the enjoyment of telling others about it.
