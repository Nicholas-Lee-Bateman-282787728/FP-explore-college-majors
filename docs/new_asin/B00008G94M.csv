To begin with, this black and white film on the life of the medieval saint Joseph of Cupertino is brilliantly cast.  Maximillian Scnell plays the rather stupid Joseph, a perennial klutz who can't keep anything straight in his head without much effort.  But he loves God profoundly and desires to become a monk.  The second thing that surprised me was how funny this movie was.  It's quite episodical, and the humor is of the old more theatrical style - but given those limitations, it set me off laughing more than a few times.  Richardo Montebalm also gives a great performance as the uptight monk who can't stand Joseph's stupidity or his extrordinary gifts.  God blesses Joseph's love with unusual graces, onces that literally knock him off his feet, to the bewilderment of his priestly brothers.
A real treat.  Don't miss it.  Hope it goes to DVD!",1068163200,34,1006,4.763005780346821
7983592,5,B00008G94M,"This film is a sensitive and very sweet account of Saint Joseph of Cupertino.  He seemed to be dumb and awkward but was very close to God.  After becoming ordained he began to levitate in prayer.  He submitted to all kinds of humiliation and unkindness with faith and great love.  It is a good film for anyone suffering from similar difficulties - he could do nothing right, seemingly.  The acting is just right for the characters.",1509062400,,431,4.618421052631579

I watch it continuously, and recommend if you haven't seen it, Drop everything to get it and watch it.  Its truly spectacular and you won't be dissappointed",1245110400,,252,4.704545454545454
7983596,5,B00008G94M,"It is too bad that that this great movie about St. Joseph of Cupertino is confused by so many people including Amazon.  Half of the comments for the movie about Cupertino are about another movie of the same title but about St. Francis of Asssi.  Even when I searched Amazon to find if the Cupertino movie was available on DVD I found that Amazon has the movie starring the same actors as in the Cupertino movie listed for movie about St. Francis.  Everyone is mixed up.  Unless they have fixed this problem or have muddled it even more please be sure you are ordering the correct item.  The movie about Cupertino is a nice wholesome family movie.  Yes it is a bit 1960's corny and has implausable moments, but it is overall a great movie to sit down with the family and be moved by the humble, and sometimes huble amusing holiness of Cupertino.  I think this is one of the great Catholic movies of all time and deserves to be in every Catholic home along with the other greats such as Song of Bernadette etc.  But it appears as of this writing that it is not available for purchase, probably because of the confusion by all as explained above.  So the great movie about Cupertino being linked forever to (what I gather as) a second rate docudrama about Assisi my be its demise.  If anyone knows about a source for DVD's or if you can assist in informing a company such as Ignatius Press please do so.  If you have an insight write me at jeromequigley@hotmail.com  Thanks",1230422400,6,1470,4.4440298507462686
7983597,5,B00008G94M,"Great, humorous movie of the life of a poor peasant (Joseph Cuppertino, NOT Francis of Assisi!) with seemingly below average intelligence who understands the Holy Trinity better than his learned brother monks and abbot.  Highly recommend this movie for first time viewers of Catholic movies.",1207440000,9,291,5.466666666666667
7983598,5,B00008G94M,"I first saw this movie forty years ago. It is likely dated in the opinion of some, but the story of St Joseph is a happy one, and a beautiful twist on the theme of the ugly duckling who becomes a swan.
American movies generally portray typical homes and environments is a very plastic and unrealistic manner. European movies are more realistic and show life as it really is, or was. This is an opinion that many will question, but movies like The Reluctant Saint, Closely Watched Trains, The Shop on Main Street, The Conjugal Bed, Divorce Italian Style and others of that variety make life very down to earth, and leave more room for reflection in the aftermath.",1193788800,,662,4.571428571428571
7983599,5,B00008G94M,"This a true gem of a movie.  It has amazing performances from great actors such as Maximilian Schell and Ricardo Montalban, and would suit anyone who likes a good movie.  If anyone is Catholic, this is especially a great movie, orthodox to its core and accurate with the life of this amazing saint, Saint Joseph of Cupertino (the patron saint of astronauts,pilots, and students preparing for exams--watch the movie to see why).  There is nothing weak about this movie.  I wish they also had it on DVD.  It is especially great in showing how the virtue of humility is the most important in one's efforts to attain holiness and how we are called to do what God wants us to do, not what we want to do.",1185667200,3,698,4.464566929133858
7983600,5,B00008G94M,"Who are to be the teachers of faith?  Shall they be the learned theologians who develop intricate arguments to explain the Trinity?  Or are they simple folk with an embracing love of animals and their fellow man?  Everyone thinks that Joseph (the young monk played by Maximilian Schell) is a simpleton and a fool. But a visting bishop thinks otherwise when he is bored by a tedious religious lecture and turns to the warm hospitality of Joseph.

Attitudes change when a miracle is revealed. The members of the monastery are abuzz with confusion and awe when they discover that Joseph also possesses the gift of levitation.  A strange but affecting film that is appropriate for all age levels.  I believe it would be far better known if a DVD was made.",1182124800,4,751,4.694656488549619
