8266332,5,B0017L963S,I love this video.  It shows beautiful scenes in Maui and plays lovely music.  If you have a big t.v. (like 46 inch or bigger) it is even better.  After a stressful day of work just put in the dvd and get a drink and watch the waves roll in on Maui.  It also has a lot of helicopter footage that you could only see by chartering your own helicopter- but you get to see it here.  There are no people to watch on this just unspoiled Hawaii.,1282176000,3,438,3.9318181818181817
