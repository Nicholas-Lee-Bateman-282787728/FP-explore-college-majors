2194428,5,B0006SSP9O,"Wow, I was so shocked when I saw this great show from the early 80s was to be released on dvd.  My video tape recordings have not held up well over these many years.  I just hope they don't do what was done to Quantum Leap season 2, taking out the pop songs that were a part of the show.  Maybe since Joey Scarbury sang the songs, such as Rocket Man and Eve of Destruction, they won't have to deal with copyright laws.  For those of you who don't know the story of Ralph Hinkley and Bill Maxwell, you are in for a treat.  Ralph was a teacher for troubled high school kids.  On his first day he decides to take them on a field trip to the desert.  The school bus stops at a roadside diner, where we meet FBI agent Maxwell.  Bill and the troubled youth Tony (played perfectly by a very young Michael Pare) have an altercation that results in one drawing his gun and the other his switchblade, respectively.  Then it's off to the desert, and a close encounter with the ""little green guys"".  Ralph and Bill are told that the Earth is racing toward destruction, and it needs a protector.  Ralph is given a special suit that only works on him.  It gives him super powers, such as flight, invisibility, super-strength.  It would do a whole lot more, except Ralph loses the instruction book.  Also starring the beautiful Contessa Selleca, aka Connie Selleca, as Ralph's lawyer girlfriend, this comedy/action/drama was waaaaay ahead of its time.  It only ran for three seasons, which is probably a good thing, because that way it didn't burn itself out as many other longer-running tv shows did.  So let's all take three running steps and leap like we're jumping off a diving board, and fly!",1103068800,,1682,4.465573770491804
2194429,5,B0006SSP9O,"Not even 50 episodes exist for this great show.  A true shame.  This is one of the classics, and it's FINALLY coming to DVD.  If you haven't seen The Greatest American Hero or thought of it as just a 'kids' show, you're really missing out.

Great characters, great scripts and some truly great television.  After some horrible treatment by the network (ABC) during it's original run (late season debuts, pre-empting of the show, poorly written ads, changing timeslots, etc.) the show was finally laid to rest far too early right in the middle of its third season, replaced by shows that scored poorer ratings.  Go figure.

Hopefully, this DVD release will garner some newfound respect for this HIGHLY underappreciated show.  If you're a fan, BUY IT!  If you're not a fan, at least rent it and see for yourself!  Believe it or not, THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO is coming to DVD!!!",1102550400,3,877,4.748344370860927
2194430,5,B0006SSP9O,"From the people who brought you ""Wiseguy"", ""The A-Team"", ""The Rockford Files"", ""21 Jump Street"", ""Hunter"", ""Hardcastle and McCormick"", and many, many more...comes one of the most underappreciated and misunderstood shows in the history of television.

I often think of it as a complementary piece to ""The A-Team"".  It was produced in the two years immediately preceding the premiere of ""The A-Team"", by the same creative personnel.  But whereas ""The A-Team"" was a straightforward concept executed in a very outlandish style, ""The Greatest American Hero"" was an outlandish concept executed in a very straightforward style.  The show is often misidentified as a comedy, spoof, or satire, but it isn't; no more than any of the other series I mentioned in the first sentence.

It was a series whose premise was difficult for the masses to ""get""; and, apparently, impossible to explain to someone who didn't see the pilot episode.  This is the one place where I would fault the producers.  After the pilot, the series never really recapped the premise in a way that would help a brand new viewer understand the show (ala The A-Team's opening narration, or the OCB briefing sessions at the beginning of many Wiseguy episodes).

High school teacher Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) and FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) are partnered to ""...change things, save this planet from destruction"", by aliens who give Ralph a suit that will give him unearthly powers when he wears it.  However, before he can even get it home, Ralph loses the instruction book the aliens provided to properly operate the suit and it's powers.  The first time he tries to fly, he crashes into a brick wall and knocks himself unconscious (while a homeless man makes of with his street clothes, no less).  Sound like a silly premise?  It's not.

It's a show about ordinary people in extaordinary circumstances.  It's about struggling against adversity when you don't always have the necessary resources; or when you do have the nesessary resources, but no idea how to use them.  In short: it's The Human Condition...in 49 minutes, set to a jaunty Mike Post score...

Was it an early 1980's, prime-time, action-adventure show? Sure.  Was it a satire, a spoof, a kiddie show? Never!  The seriousness with which ""The Greatest American Hero"" was written and acted (the respect for the premise and the characters, keeping it all rooted in reality) is what makes this show unique, unforgettable, and a must-have for everybody's home video library.  The best episodes in this set are written by series creator Stephen J. Cannell, and director Rod Holcomb helps set the tone with his brilliant work on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th episodes

Co-starring: Connie Sellecca, Michael Pare, Faye Grant, Don Cervantes, Jesse D. Goins, and Brandon Williams.

...and, if you don't blink, you'll even see a young Danny Glover as plain clothes cop in the episode ""Fire Man"".",1102204800,19,2912,5.0
2194431,5,B0006SSP9O,"My brother and I have been huge fans of this show since it was originally released.  We still have some taped episodes from 1981 and 1982.  But it will be really nice to see the show digitally remastered and without the lame early 80's commercials.

This show has it all, comedy, drama, action, special effects (from the 80's, but still).  Plus the theme song, ""Believe it or not"" is awesome.  Some of you might be familiar w/ George's answering machine song from ""Seinfeld.""  If you weren't aware, that message is a direct parody of the theme song.  So, I mean, a show that is parodied on Seinfeld can't be all bad.  Am I right??",1101945600,12,630,4.464912280701754

2194466,4,B0006SSP9O,"Started weatching this on the H&I channel, needed to see the pilot episode to make sense of it, and the price was right! Somehow I'd never heard of this until recently, and once I got beyond the Seinfeld connection thoroughly enjoyed it. This show is almost brilliant... the writing could have been a tad sharper, the over-use of the same special effects time and time again cut back a bit, and we'd have a hit on our hands! As it is, good fun all round.",1504051200,,454,4.352941176470588
2194467,5,B0006SSP9O,"""The Greatest American Hero"" gave us a real twist on the super-hero show. William Katt (also known as Paul Drake, Jr. in earlier Perry Mason TV movies) was a school teacher chosen by aliens to receive a ""super suit"" with which to do good deeds. That leads to the second innovation in the series ... he lost the instruction manual. Therefore, throughout the first season he has no idea what the suit will really do. He only learns by accident and trial and error. Leaving clothes behind as he shucks them to reveal the suit and fly away puts pressure on his meager budget. LOL

Robert Culp, always entertaining, is perfect as the gung ho FBI agent who finds out about the suit and is determined to help Katt use it to fight crime. His back and forth quips with Katt's semi juvenile delinquent class roster were always amusing. Connie Sellecca was a trendy casting choice in the day because of her beauty, but she delivered solid acting performances, and here she's quite good as Katt's fiance. Her profession in the show is an attorney.

The shows have somewhat serious plots dealing with bad guys, but they are all played for laughs as Katt struggles to use the suit and struggles between his anti-establishment penchant and the circumstance that finds him working closely with an FBI agent. The theme song was one of the few TV themes to chart highly as a single.

Although the series sort of ran out of steam in the second season, the first season works very well, and we found it to be unforgetable. Make sure to get it from a reseller though. The fifty dollar ""new"" price (as I type) is ridiculous, and resellers have it used for as little as three dollars or less, plus shipping.",1503360000,4,1684,4.551155115511551

Constant re-use of stunt footage (Ralph taking off, flying, landing, crashing into and through things) - also from a time when viewers couldn't binge-watch and might not notice? Check. But it's smarter than I remembered, and while he's earnest and good-hearted Ralph is also snarky and occasionally self-centered, and whatever they were like off-screen (and I've heard stories) William Katt and Robert Culp had great chemistry.

At any other time, in any other incarnation, tale of a scrawny school teacher gifted a magical suit by aliens to help save the world would seem just plain dumb.

Remarkably, the situations hold up very well under today's scrutiny; the winning team of William Katt, Robert Culp and Connie Sellecca giving it their all and making us believe in the impossible.

Starz/Anchor Bay has marginally missed the mark in bringing this series to DVD. Chief problem is edge enhancement - a lot of it. Otherwise, compression issues are well concealed. Colors pop and fine detail appears impressively sharp.  We'd love to see this series go 1080p.",1398556800,,781,4.82089552238806

It also sent a strong moral message about honesty and doing the right thing even when no one is looking. Seems like in most TV shows now, we see just the opposite values being stressed, not to mention knocking marriage, honor, duty, and love of Country, so this TV series and others like it have become my TV watching when I do watch TV now, simply because they espouse the values I was brought up with. It is very much worth the purchase and sharing it with your kids to give them a taste of what life and TV was like back in the 1980's.

2194626,3,B0006SSP9O,"I loved the show as a kid and still enjoyed it as an adult at 39.

Of the reviews I read, this video by Anchor Bay with this cover is the one to get. Or, supposedly, a Japanese  version has ALL of the original music but, I could not find one. I personally don't see how anyone can remember al of the exact songs and realize they were changed.

There are a few good episodes on season 2, but as mentioned in some bonus commentaries (I think in season 1), the stories were getting worse and way too cheesy with sea monsters, weird aliens, and ghosts. That seems like a weird comment given the story about a super hero with an alien suit, but even for this show the stories were lacking the originality and capability and just out of place.

Season two also accelerated the use of the powers of the suit without letting the viewers see Ralph discovering them which was part of the charm of the original story. All of the sudden he has two or more powers he is familiar with.

Some of the stories/episodes seemed way too short and they were setting the show up to end already in this season, talking about other heroes and everyone discovering Ralph with the suit, among other things. I guess that is bound to happen with a super hero without a mask.

According to the writers and actors commentaries the extra cheesiness of the new aliens, monsters, and ghosts was the reason the series ended. They said it was the direction the execs wanted them to go and the morons ruined it. There was so much potential to keep to the original story about a regular guy dealing with the gift of a goofy suit in a somewhat realistic world and how people would really react.

The movie case/booklet design on this one is pretty nice too. There are 3 individual cases which can hold 2 dvds each and they are stored in a outer case.

They reused a lot of footage like a merry go round of jumping, flying, and landing which got a bit too boring, but I found it kind of fun to watch for the wires and the stunt man which did not take much to notice.

Not so sure if I want season 3 now mostly because of the stories going downhill and the prices for season 3 are nearly 3 times more $. I'll have to read up on more reviews and think about it. I'll likely buy it since I like the show and want to see more.",1360540800,,2283,4.205949656750572

2194645,4,B0006SSP9O,"I remember this show fondly from when I was growing up and it was great to watch this season again. It's a good clean show with characters you'll like and good banter. I also really enjoy the music in this series.

It IS a low budget show however... as you watch episodes you will begin to notice clips they seem to reuse (mostly Ralph flying, but others too) - and the aliens are poorly done.  BUT this is a show you watch because you like the characters and the writing - not the special effects.

(Other shows written and produced by Stephen J. Cannell you might be familiar with are: The Rockford Files, The Commish, and the A-Team. Chances are if you like those you will probably like this too.)

In the beginning of season 1, Ralph has a young son who is enjoyable but I guess they decided the show worked better without him (how could a single father be constantly off chasing bad guys with a young boy to look after) so he slips quietly away by end of season 1. Season 2 has a LOT more episodes, and he's gained a few powers. Season 3 starts off with Ralph and Bill getting beamed up to the alien ship (and he gets another book of instructions) - and ends with them getting beamed up again and chewed out for not using the suit properly. So you see the aliens twice in season 3.

What sucked was that it didn't include the 2-hr pilot episode!  If you buy the DVD it's included on there, but with Amazon instant video you're out of luck.

(Blockbuster rentals shows the pilot episode is included with season 1 from them - but if you don't want to wait for that, somebody posted the pilot episode on YouTube (in 11 parts).  It's REALLY poor picture and sound quality thoughout so I don't recommend it. But I suffered thru it and will fill you in below if you want, so you can get started with Season 1, Episode 1 up-to-speed on what you missed in the pilot.

*********************
PILOT episode recap:
*********************

  Begins with a black guy in a suit, getting chased in the desert by a gang of white skin heads, and they kill him.
  Skips to ""Ralph Hinkley"" (our hero) a HS teacher on his first day at the school, meeting his ""special ed"" students (the delinquents). For some reason he decides to take the small class on a field trip to the desert in a school mini-van bus. They stop at a cafe and the head class delinquent (Tony) has a bit of a run-in with the FBI agent ""Bill Maxwell"" but Ralph separates them and apologizes. Bill is in a bad mood and is cranky but lets it go.
  Later Ralph and the kids are headed back from their field trip and are driving through the desert area (in the dark), and the van dies. Ralph tells the kids to stay with the vehicle and starts walking back for help.
  While walking back, a car is coming at him driving wildly. Ralph throws himself down trying to avoid getting hit and the car stops right in front of him - he picks himself up and goes to check and yell at the driver who it turns out is Agent Maxwell and he seems drunk/disoriented. (He is freaked as his car just went wonky on him and can't figure it out.)
  Suddenly as the 2 are out there (alone), an Alien spaceship comes down - they jump into Bill's car in hopes of some protection and the door locks lock themselves and the windows won't open and they can't break out. Then the radio dial moves and selects words to tell them ""there is nothing to fear but fear itself"" and basically that they won't be harmed.  Then they hear the voice of Bill's missing FBI partner (which turns out to be the black guy that just got killed at the beginning of the show) who is talking to them from the spaceship. He says they are being offered a gift, a special suit that will work ONLY for Ralph and that they are to team up and work together to do great things for their world.  If they accept. If they don't decide to accept - the suit will self destruct within 2 weeks.
  They say ok and the partner beams down and comes and puts the package in the trunk. He stops for a moment and tells Bill he was shot/killed in the desert and the aliens came along a few hours later and picked him up and gave him the chance for a new life with them. He never answers Bill's questions as to what happened or who killed him. He beams back up and the ship goes away.
  The men freak out and go look in the trunk. Bill is refusing to believe what just happened and wants nothing to do with it. He gives the pkg to Ralph and then drives off. Ralph finds an instruction manual with the box/pkg but manages to drop it in the desert walking back to the van and students. The vehicle now magically works and they all go home.
  The next morning Ralph has realized he lost the manual before he got to the van last night, but decides to try on the suit (in private) while his boy is in the next room watching Superman cartoons. When he leaves for work he takes the suit.
  When he gets there he is told there is a drunk man in the boys room asking for him (Bill). Bill hasn't had a drink in 10 years but evidently tied one one bigtime after their alien experience. They grudgingly decide to try to work together with the suit to do good things.
  Later, Ralph is trying to get to the court (a custody hearing for his son, with his lawyer and now girlfriend ""Pam Davidson"" (Connie Sellecca). He realizes he is not going to make it in time by car, so he decides to wear the suit and try flying there like Superman. A little boy helps him out by telling him he has to take 3 running steps and then spring like off a diving board. This works but he's horrible at it and hits the corner of a bldg as he flies by, knocking his bundle of clothes out of his hands.
  He continues to holler and yell in fear as he fumbles in the air flying into a sign on the side of a building and knocking himself out.  2 cops come over to him and he has no ID and is in the suit, laying in an alley and they haul him to an institution.
  They strap him to a table in a room. While left alone in there he hears sounds of danger and rips himself free of the super restraints and then ""sees"" a vision on the wall of Bill in danger from the skinheads...
  Pam had found out where Ralph was (sorry I forget how) and she comes in to get him and finds him dressed in the red hero suit examining an area of the bare wall where he saw the vision (looking insane).
  Ralph determines he has to go save Bill and runs out with Pam behind him and they take off in her car.  He tells her the story but she thinks he's nuts. He rescues Bill without Pam really seeing the suit in action, and then the 3 of them are pulled over to the side of the road.
  Ralph proves the power of the suit to Pam by lifting the front end of the car up with Bill in it and Pam passes out. etc....they get their first bad guys together...etc.
  And towards the end the 3 are in the desert area again and the spaceship comes back (so now Pam sees it too) and tells them they did good and the aliens are pleased and they suggest Ralph use the invisibility powers - but fly off before he can tell them he lost the manual and needs instructions.

So that's how they meet, get the suit, why Ralph has to be the one to wear it, why he doesn't have instructions, why he has to work with Bill and how Pam knows about it all.

I hope you enjoy this series as much as I do. :-)",1345852800,,7295,4.11864406779661

2194649,5,B0006SSP9O,"The Greatest American Hero(1981-1983) was a breezy action-comedy series created by Stephen J. Cannell. Joey Scarbury sang the show's classic soft rock theme song 'Believe It or Not'. George from Seinfeld(1989-1999) sang a spoof of it for his answering machine. William Katt(from 1976's Carrie) plays mild mannered teacher Ralph Hinkley. He tries to be patient with a class of misfit students just like in To Sir With Love(1967). Aliens from outer space give Ralph a red/black suit with superpowers and he's ordered to work with FBI Agent Bill Maxwell(Robert Culp). It's an homage to Close Encounters of the Third Kind(1977) and Superman(1978). Ralph dates a lovely, raven black haired lawyer called Pam Davidson(Connie Selleca). I like the look on Pam's face when she first sees Ralph in the ""supersuit"". She thinks that he's lost his sanity. The Greatest American Hero pokes fun of superhero cliches and it's packed with robust heroics. The show's stunts, action scenes, and visual effects are solid considering the show's limited budget. For an entire season, Ralph's surname was changed from Hinkley to ""Hanley"" after some guy tried to assassinate President Reagan. There was a spin off pilot called The Greatest American Heroine. It was reedited and shown in syndication with the rest of this show. The music on this show was quite good. There are rumors that a Greatest American Hero movie is in the works.

Though the picture is excellent and the sound ok for a show that is like 25 years old, the DVD started to freeze about 10 minutes into the first disc. It kept getting worse after that and it was kind of tough to follow the story. Returned it to Amazon for a replacement, which I received less than a week later (great service, like always). The second shipment was a bit better, at least through the pilot. Only froze twice. Yet the next episode was always impossible to watch due to the same problems. Don't feel like returning this one so I ordered the Complete Series in hopes the recordings will be better. As the price on these DVDs is really low I feel it's worth taking another chance. The show is so much fun, not only for us who remember it from days gone by, but also for the youngsters like our grandchildren. Waiting for the new shipment to come in, keeping my fingers crossed the quality of the DVDs will be better than the first season!",1294272000,,1121,4.368421052631579
2194662,3,B0006SSP9O,"Recently purchased the second (and best) season of THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO. The only full season of the series sees Ralph and Bill going up against the usual assortment of criminals, terrorists, and enemy spies out to destroy the world while Ralph futilely tries to juggle his super-powered extra-curricular activities with his love life and teaching career. Ralph also discovers an assortment of new powers this season and even manages to get the ""Green Guys"" (as Bill so eloquently calls them) to furnish him with a new instruction book...which he promptly loses.
 Unfortunately the musical inserts that originally ran during the episodes are once again conspicuously absent, replaced with generic tunes. Most times you won't notice the replacements except as in the case of when THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION is dedicated to Ralph as a message from the Green Guys(he makes mention of the song when talking to Bill)but the song that plays on the radio isn't The Eve of Destruction. Hopefully, someday, they'll work out the snaffu concerning song rights and we'll get a proper release with the right music in place.
  The only downside to the Mill Creek release is that it lacks the special features available on the Anchor Bay release, so if those are important to you I'd recommend purchasing that version over this. Other than the lack of extras the Mill Creek release is the equal to the Anchor Bay release as far as audio/video quality is concerned. The sound and picture are crisp, clear, and as clean as can be expected from an early 80's TV series. Overall I'd say that if you're a fan of the series then season two is the must see season as this was when the show was truly firing on all cylinders.",1291334400,,1704,4.789115646258503

I recommend buying the actual DVD set since it does have the pilot episode on the disc. As for the actual episode here titled, 'The Hit Car' it is a perfect example of late 70's early 80's tv. It's fun it's dated and it has an armored hit car in it. I loved every second of it! It more than sets the tone for the series off the wall and wonderful (though now dated) 80's dialouge, action and story lines. A great episode imo. I actually have the DVD set.

The video and audio is very good considering how old the tapes were when it was put on dvd.  The lack of extras was a bit disappointing however, some interviews with the stars or guest stars reminiscing about their time on the show would've been nice.

Please note: the episodes for season 3 are out of broadcast sequence in the 2005 dvd set, which threw me at first.  One episode they were married, then the next they weren't.  If you want to watch them in the same order in which they were originally broadcast you will be playing musical discs, but then the show's story progression makes a lot more sense.

They were more entertaining! For the children of today, I think a show like Greatest American Hero would send good, positive messages rather than negative violence. Our children need to dis-associate with all the violence they watch on TV and with video games.

2194667,5,B0006SSP9O,"This episode, which we GAH fans abbreviate as ""DVS,"" is considered by many to be the best episode of the entire series. It's the Season Three opener (although on the DVD set it isn't first on the disc), and it's a goodie. It was directed by Ivan Dixon (Kinchloe on ""Hogan's Heroes""). It packs a LOT of stuff into a 1 hour show. The main theme is Ralph, Bill and the Suit. Ralph wants to give it up; he strips it off, hands it to Bill and walks off. A few moments later Bill is in danger and Ralph runs back to help him. Does he forget he doesn't have the suit on or is it simply because Bill's his best friend? Any way, that's just a small portion of this great ep. They meet up with the green guys again and get to go up in their ship. I don't want to say too much, just get it. There are some funny bits and some wonderfully poignant bits, when you realize how Bill and Ralph feel about one another. Watch for Bill going ""Hold it! Freeze yer face!""

2194670,5,B0006SSP9O,"What a trip back to the 80s. This show was a classic even though it didn't last too long. What i remember most about the show was how amazingly cheesey it was but the dialouge was so great that you don't even notice the chessey effects. Season one was great, the pilot was so wonderful, and it really sets the tone for the humor. But my fav is season 2, the laughs just keep coming and coming. Im litteraly on the floor every min, Robert Culp proves to be one of the most underrated comedic actors of all time. I truly believe that he in fact made the show last as long as it did. No offense to Bill Katt or Connie, both were wonderful as well. In fact i applaud Bill Katt because having to wear that rediculous suit and being able to act is remarkable. With all the laughter in season 2, you also get a true gem, the season finale Lillacs, Mr Maxwell. Written and directed by Bob Culp, was truly a wonderful story. I loved it because it really took you away from all the silly stuff and could really stir up emotions. Plus i love the cutting Culp did at the end where he hugs O`Neil. A Simillar dramatic episode is Vanity, The Preacher said, from season 3. Also written and directed by Culp. I also loved that story too cause it wasn't a routine suit case and it dealt with a more serious, almost impossible issue, dealing with the policits of another country. Culp really had great stories and wish he could`ve written more. But all in all  you will love this, so what its cheesey, it was meant to be that way, you will laugh nonstop i gauarntee it!!",1266019200,,1552,4.243243243243243

2194689,4,B0006SSP9O,"This comedy drama series that aired from the Spring of 1981 thru the Winter of 1983 on ABC created by Stephen J. Cannell that debuted with a 2-hour movie pilot on Wednesday March 18, 1981 starred Bill Katt as high school teacher of Special Education students(Ralph Hinkley), Bob Culp as FBI Agent(Bill Maxwell), and Connie Sellecca as Ralph's lawyer and new wife(Pam Davidson)about chronicaling Ralph's adventures after a group of aliens give him a red suit that gives him superhuman abilities.

Unfortunately, Ralph hates wearing the suit & immediately loses its instruction booklet & thus has to learn how to use his powers by trial & error, often with comical results.

This 1981-82 Season of THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO takes me all the way back to memory lane when THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO theme song ""Believe It Or Not"" by Joey Scarbury became a big hit on the radio back in the early 1980's and when THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up starting with THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO at 8PM followed by THE FALL GUY at 9PM, and then topped off by DYNASTY at 10PM, which reminds me that ABC's motto at the time was ""Now Is The Time, ABC Is The Place"".

Therefore, THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO and THE FALL GUY used to give me something to look forward to every hump day along with the fact that THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's 2nd Season was an upgrade from it's 1st Season, since THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's First Season was when this show was just starting to crawl, but THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's Second Season was pretty much when this show started to walk, especially since this show was still in its honeymoon phase during this season.

Additionally, I would have to say that this was the strongest season of them all throughout THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's whole 2-year run on ABC, since the ratings on this show went downhill in the Third Season when ABC had moved THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO to Friday nights in the Fall of 1982 and due to a change in management at ABC since the new managers requested for more-heroic save-by-the-day episodes instead of being more of a down-to-Earth, real-life problems like show, which resulted in ABC cancelling this show on Thursday February 3, 1983.

In addition to what led to a sharp drop in ratings, THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO had started losing a lot of viewers through more popular TV shows like KNIGHT RIDER & THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, which conflicted with THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's time slot on ABC's Friday night line-up, since THE DUKES OF HAZZARD was shown on CBS at the same time slot that THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was shown on ABC every Friday night and then KNIGHT RIDER came out that same year on NBC being shown every Friday at 9PM on top of that wiping out just about every show in the ratings department that season, which therefore pretty much resulted in KNIGHT RIDER K.O.ing THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD among many other shows.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we were in back in 1981-1982 during Ronald Reagan's presidency.",1228003200,,3135,4.6909090909090905

2194705,5,B0006SSP9O,"Greatest American Hero is a superhero drama-comedy. I think that is what has to be kept in mind.....COMEDY.  Ralph Hinckley (played by William Katt) is a ""special ed"" schoolteacher at Whitney High. After coming back from a field trip, the school bus breaks down.  Ralph walks through the desert to get help. While on the road he has an out of control car almost hit him.  The car is being driven by Special FBI Agent Bill Maxwell (played by Robert Culp). Bill Maxwell's character is reminiscent of Culp's role in the 1960s I Spy series. Ralph recognizes him as the guy he and his class ran into earlier in a diner (encounter between Tony and Bill/gun vs. switchblade) Ralph and Bill then are trapped in their car by a space ship and talked to by way of the car radio.  The aliens tell them that they have to work together to save the world. Bill's partner gives them a box, which he puts in the trunk (it's the suit). Bill takes off; Ralph walks back to the bus and loses the instruction manual to the suit along the way.  Ralph has to learn on his own.  He flies through the air flailing his arms and legs, instead of the classic Superman-like ""arms extended, legs together"" pose. In fact, his first flight results in him flying out of control running head first into a wall. Of course the suit has other powers......super strength, invisibility, super speed, X-ray vision etc...  Pam Davidson (played by Connie Sellecca) plays an attorney, Ralph's girlfriend (later wife) also co-starring on the show were Michael Par&eacute; and Faye Grant as two of Ralph's students.
The show is quirky and funny and not badly written for the 1980s.  In one episode in the first season (Rosetta Rose) Ralph is called Mr. Hanley throughout the entire show.  This was due to the assassination attempt on President Reagan ......they were going to phase out the name Hinckley and replace it with Hanley.  It is a glaring blunder as on the write up on the outside of the case, he is referred to as Hinckley for that episode.  Also in the Best Desk Scenario, Ralph Hinckley's new office door has the nameplate Ralph Hanley.  There are mistakes, inconsistencies, scenes used over and over, and who cares...  The actors in this are great.  Robert Culp is so believable as an over the top patriotic FBI agent.  William Katt is the perfect humanitarian and reluctant hero.  The two are like Oscar and Felix and play off each other wonderfully! And, Robert Culp's car problems from I-Spy follow him (they get trashed one way or another).

2194710,3,B0006SSP9O,"Sometimes, if you have fond memories of a show, you really oughtn't go back to see it later. Ow! Painful bits of 1980s writing and acting. (I do sometimes miss the days when one could spot the bad guy pretty much as soon as the actor opened his mouth.) Seeing the DVDs, the re-use of various special effects shots is painfully obvious and can cut into suspension of disbelief.

The concept is still wonderful. Ralph Hinkley (whose surname changes a few times as this was aired around the time John Hinkley shot the preseident) is an idealistic teacher of surley youths (think Sweathogs). Bill Maxwell is a by-the-book FBI agent worried about his career, the Red Menace, and getting old. The two are partnered by a group of aliens who give Ralph a super-costume. Joining them is Ralph's fiance, Pam Davis, an attorney.

There's some good use of themes here, particularly in The Best Desk Scenario, where Ralph, Pam, and Bill all deal with their careers, and Bill faces a mid-life crisis.

Bill's attitude towards Pam's career grates a bit on the modern ear. More grating are the attitudes of Pam's parents and various members of the public they interact with. This attitude is even more grating in the pilot for Greatest American heroine, where Ralph ask probing questions about Holly's dedication to her causes if she were to find the right guy, marry, have kids.

While the Greatest American Heroine isn't the worst pilot I've ever seen, it is a contender. Kind of a Buffy-concept (good-hearted ditz gets super powers) but without SMG's acting talent or Joss' writing wit.

The pilot itself is nearly incoherent -- it may have been a two hour pilot edited down to a 1 hour episode. There's something about illegal whaling in Newfoundland, but we are never told what is going on, or why, just that Holly (with Bill's reluctant help) saves the day.

As to the concept, Ralph's teenage students are replaced with Holly's kindergarteners. Holly also works in animal rescue with a cutsie-business name. (I groaned as much as Bill when I saw it.) I'm not sure how well the mix-matched buddy concept would have worked over several episodes.

I remember being fascinated and waiting week after week to see exactly what new mission Ralph (William Katt) and Bill (Robert Culp) would be on and if Ralph would discover any new powers that the suit might have or to find out if Ralph ever would find that instruction manual.  The set-up of the series is genius:  an ordinary guy is given a special suit by aliens that has special powers, but he looses the instruction manual.  In addition, he's teamed up with a government agent to be his partner.  Despite the fantasy and sci-fi elements and the clich potlines, the series was very intimate and dealt with important issues that affected everyone.  THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was one of Stephen J.Cannell's better productions (2nd best after THE A-TEAM) and all 22 episodes of the second season are included on this DVD set.  Some of the episodes I liked most were:

""The Two-Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Fastball""--baseball and national security are an issue in this episode that has Ralph joining the major leagues as an overnight pitching sensation.  Guest appearances by Mike Douglas and Don Drysdale are made.

""Operation:  Spoilsport""--the biggest fear in the 1980s was that an accident with our nuclear arsenal would occur starting WWIII and the end of the world.  That's exactly what Ralph and Bill are trying to prevent.

""Don't Mess Around With Jim""--in this episode we learn some insight into the ""jamies"" that give Ralph powers from an unlikely source:  an reclusive billionaire who has faked his own death.

""Train of Thought""--Ralph suffers from amnesia after being hit by a hijacked train.

""Now You See It""--Ralph discovers that the suit allows him to see future events before they happen and he sees Pam (Connie Selleca) die in a plane crash.  He does everything in his power to prevent the accident before it happens.

""Dreams""--while attempting to use the suit to improve the lives of his friends and co-workers, Ralph discovers that it ends up complicating their lives even more.

""Captain Bellybuster""--a television advertising icon turns out to be a real-life hero.

""Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell""--Bill falls in love with a beautiful woman who turns out to be a foreign agent spying on the U.S.  Sometimes love can be treason.

Despite how much I enjoy this series, there were a couple of episodes I didn't like when I first saw them as a kid and after seeing them again I dislike them even more. Those two episodes are:  ""The Beast in the Black""--where Ralph and Bill are caught up with a creature from the supernatural realm in a house that appears haunted and ""The Shock Will Kill You"" -after saving the Space Shuttle from disaster, Ralph becomes electrified and inadvertently releases an electricity-eating space alien that's headed directly towards L.A.  These two episodes just didn't fit with the flow of the show and are even more unbelievable and sensational than anything else that happened in the series.  They are perfect examples of what happened when the network began attempting to wrestle control of the series from Cannell & Co.

The special features on this DVD set include an in-depth interview with Stephen J. Cannell where he explains how he got into show business and created the various shows he did, an interview with Mike Post who created much of the music played in the show, a photo gallery, a DVD-ROM Screenplay of ""Two-Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Fastball"", and a Japanese track of ""Two-Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Fastball"" (it's hilarious to listen to if you don't know Japanese).",1157414400,3,3929,4.955725190839694

  one night ralph is driving and spots a light in the sky,as does bill(culp as the funny non bending f.b.i. man) the light is a spaceship and ralph is given a ""supersuit"" with a book to tell how to use the suit(which he loses at once) and as he and ramrod stright maxwell join forces to save the world,ralph must also find out how to work the ""suit""!

  this is one of the best and most fun shows to come out of the early 80's and it was also one of the most over looked ones today. get this great action/comedy show and enjoy the tounge and cheek humor that is still fresh today.

2194721,5,B0006SSP9O,"Early in Season 2 you can tell things were really rolling for this series.  It debuted mid-season the previous year and really piqued the interests of its audience. Magic jammies that can make you Superman...what kid wouldn't want one?  Younger viewers could immediately identify with this, but older viewers could see the logic in that with power comes responsibility.  Not to mention the comedy of someone trying to use such a gift without instructions!

The entire series is super-clean so that the entire family can enjoy it together.  You simply don't get shows like this anymore.  The age shows a bit, especially in the suits and hairstyles of the actors, some of the drama music, and of course, the automobiles.  But you can tell great care had been taken in the storage of the original films, many look just like they did, if not better, than when they originally aired.  Sometimes the sound is a little iffy (ala Star Wars episode IV), but not to the extent it is a distraction.

There are only 2 disappointing things with this DVD series:

1. There aren't enough seasons to buy!

2. Some of the original scoring, generally carefully-placed and well-performed covers of popular tunes sung by Joey Scarbury and Mike Post, are missing.  You have certainly read this in other reviews. Scarbury's distinctive renditions that really made tunes such as ""Rocket Man"" and ""Eve of Distruction"" feel as if they were an integral part of the show, now gone, lessen the overall impact of the series.  Fortunately, some of the original music is performed by the duo is still there.  If you were to ask me 2 things I remember about the show the most, it would be 1. The ""Chemistry"" and performance of the actors and 2. The scoring.  You need go no further than the show's theme to see how much the music meant to the series.

Still, I give Seasons 1 & 2 5 stars.  Season 3 is really the only season I would consider otherwise.  When you consider all the pressures of the entertainment business, law""suits"" from DC Comics, and bad time spot placement (i.e, up against Night Rider and Joni Loves Chachi in the days VCR's were a luxury item), you can see why the writing and production suffered a bit in Season 3, although it's still very enjoyable.  With all the distraction, it's almost amazing it lasted as long as it did.  On the same token, this series does what many fail to do: it leaves you wanting more.  The bonus interviews are a very nice touch and satisfy some of the hunger.  So I still give 5 stars to Season 3.  It deserves it just like the rest of the series!",1147305600,4,2567,4.581140350877193

They end up finding a woman and Ralph gives her the suit and tells her what it does and she becomes Bill's new partner and Pam and Ralph drive off.

Operation: Spoilsport and Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell.

I really don't remember what songs were typically played during the episodes, but I thought they were mostly songs that were popular at the time. The only episode where this made a difference to me was Operation: Spoilsport. If the greenguys would have dedicated the lame song that replaced Eve of Destruction to Ralph, he and Bill probably would have assumed they needed to do something about the sorry state of the music industry rather than saving the world from nuclear annihilation.",1142640000,4,780,4.9465648854961835

They could have eliminated most of the Whitney High student body / bodies.  Theme song by Joey Scarbury played annoyingly often in playing the DVD's.

2194728,5,B0006SSP9O,"THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was one of those shows I remember watching fondly as a kid. I looked forward to watching the adventures of Ralph Hinkly and Bill Maxwell each week and seeing what trouble they would get into.  THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO came out during a time when it wasn't common to have superheroes how came from normal backgrounds.  The SUPERMAN movies had only been out a few years and Hollywood was sucking up superhero scripts left and right (though most of them were never made).  What was unique about THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was that Ralph Hinkley was just an ordinary guy who was given a suit with superpowers (kind of like the Green Lantern).  Ralph didn't grow up rich or come from outer space, he was just a high school teacher trying to make a difference in the world.

Ralph was partnered with Bill Maxwell, a CIA agent with a patriotic fervor and a nose for knowing where the bad guys were.  Bill was a perfect foil for Ralph and together they made a great duo.  Add the lovely Pam Davidson into the mix as Ralph's fiance and the useful 3rd-string utility person and you have a perfect blend.

William Katt played Ralph, Robert Culp played Maxwell, and Connie Sellecca played Pam.  The chemistry between the three was wonderful and helped cement the show in reality.

Ralph becomes the Greatest American Hero because one night while taking his students in a field trip out in the desert, their bus dies down. Ralph hitch hikes to get some help and is picked up by Maxwell.  While together, the car stops and starts doing some goofy things.  Then a spaceship appears and delivers a magic suit to the duo. Ralph is the one to whom the suit is given, but Maxwell is to be his partner. However, while walking back to the bus, Ralph looses the instructions to the suit. Therefore, when the adventures start he has no idea of what the suit is capable of.  He's taught how to fly by a little kid, but as much flying as he does, Ralph never does quite catch on how to fly properly.

Hollogram imagine, invisibility, superstrength, and invisibility are all attributes that the suit gives to Ralph when he wears it.

But, he doesn't learn about these things easily.

This Season One set of THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO includes all 8 episodes of the first season.  The show debuted after the Super Bowl in 1981 and was an overnight phenomena and a huge success. My favorite episodes of the first season are:

Episode 1 ""The Greatest American Hero""--the series pilot.

Episode 6 ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys""--the Lone Ranger

  makes an appearance and gives encouragement to a new hero.

Episode 8 ""The Best Desk Scenario""--Pam is kidnapped and Ralph

  and Bill have to rescue her.  This episode captures the

  essence of what made the series unique, little things were at

  the heart of the show while the superhero stuff was mostly

  backdrop and filler.

If you watched carefully, Danny Glover has a brief role in Episode 7 ""Fire Man"".  Extras with this set include a set of interviews with Stephen Cannell, William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, and Michael Pare; as well as the pilot for a never planned-out sequel THE GREATEST AMERICAN HEROINE.",1140393600,,3184,4.660071942446043

2194730,4,B0006SSP9O,"The Greatest American Hero captured a mood in the United States that began to question what its leaders were up to in the 1980s. The series had a good story line and a reasonably self-consistent mythology that, however improbable the plot, allowed viewers to believe what they saw for the duration of the episode, which is the best one can hope for from couch potatoes.

The show's popularity in the US made it expensive fare for non-Americans, so it wasn't seen on Australian TV until the 1990s. By that time the idea that the behaviour of American agencies can sometimes be less than ethical had worked itself into the collective psyche of world opinion. Connecting to that sentiment is part of the show's enduring relevance, but so is the theme song which topped Aussie radio hit parades. It is the memory of that tune that prompted me to order the DVD over a decade later.

The Greatest American Hero of the late twentieth century comes up better than ever in the twenty-first. He is, I believe, very much needed.",1130284800,3,1017,4.675977653631285

2194732,5,B0006SSP9O,"I read the other reviews for GAH Season Two and was amazed at the depth the other reviewers go into.

While the in-depth reviews are sometimes helpful, I found that I personally enjoyed the entire season. Sure, there were a couple of questionable episodes in the writing department -- but there hasn't been a series or movie (to date) that hasn't fallen prey to that problem in some form.

The entire series was good, clean family fun. I own all three seasons, and my family has enjoyed every episode. We laughed at the really silly way Ralph flies and fumbles his way through using the ""jammies""; Bill Maxwell's snacking habits (MilkBone Biscuits) and Pam's level headed guidance of ""the boys.""

2194733,4,B0006SSP9O,"I remember watching this in high school. I thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now. Okay, we're not talking Academy award material here (Emmy?).

Ralph, Bill, & Pam are back for the third and final season of this far too short series about a man who is given a suit by aliens that gives him super powers. He is teamed with an FBI agent to help the world survive itself. In the first few minutes Ralph looses the instruction book and must noodle out how to operate the suit. He runs into a few walls, literally. The first season was a little rough. The second season fleshed out the concept. This third season started to stretch its legs but the show was cancelled.

I have looked for years for novels based on the show, to no avail. I even contacted Cannell to ask if I could write them. As Disney is half-heartedly working on a feature film based on the show Cannell wouldn't cut loose with permission. Alas, It would've been fun.

Anyway, if you have the other two seasons you'll love this one. The only complaint/change I would make is having to play the theme song before each episode. I would've made it so you could hit the ""forward to next"" button and go right to the action. Also, the jacket plays a bit of the theme song. I wish they'd made it possible to change the batteries.

His FBI friend recruits him to fight crime, much like the Miami Vice of Don Johnson and Sonny. I remeber cocaine from the 80's, you can't get that quality these days...

Ralph still has his super suit and really has the basic stuff like flying and holograms and disappearing down.  Of course, there's still the odd new power like mind control to deal with.  And he still needs to keep the suit a secret from everyone as he helps Bill keep the world safe from Communists and terrorists alike.

Season 3 is only 13 episodes long, with 4 of them only having aired in syndication.  All of them are present in this four-disc set, although they are in random order.  This creates some continuity problems as Ralph and Pam are married in some episodes from discs one and two before the ceremony in disc three.  While annoying, it hardly detracts from the overall enjoyment of the shows.

And they are fun.  The three leads continue to have great chemistry and tackle every problem with wisecracks and teamwork, whether it be a rock and roll singer's life in danger, a plot to give top secret info to the Russians, a missing Middle Eastern prince, or a high school classmate in trouble.  The special effects aren't the best and a few of the episodes seem forced, but this is still an entertaining show.

My biggest disappointment is the lack of the students.  They're in a few shows, but in many they seem to be forgotten.  I always liked the problems Ralph faces while trying to save the world while teaching his students.  Still, this is a minor complaint overall.

As I noted, my biggest complaint is that the episodes aren't in original order, causing some confusion until I realized the problem.  Still, they look and sound good with a clear picture and nice Dolby sound.  There are no extras on this set.  The box has a built in chip that plays a short clip from the chorus of the theme song when pressed.  Fortunately, it seems hard to trip accidentally.

2194739,4,B0006SSP9O,"The third and final season of this interesting, likeable, but seriously flawed and troubled production has a lot of hostility towards it in certain quarters, but on the whole, its ratio of good episodes to duds is about average for the show, which was always hit & miss in its constant struggle to define itself as a show for adults (what Cannell and the cast wanted) or a show for kids (which the network wanted), and in its production values (often over-budget, the show's production values can veer wildly from episode to episode and scene to scene).  I'd say two thirds of these are pretty fun, a third are kinda screwy, but for me, even the 2nd season was spotty in the same way...

The 3rd season actually has the best flying footage, they figured out a more efficient way to do it and finally stopped using the same stock footage shot from the pilot that kept reappearing in the first and second season.  They also dumped the students (Michael Pare & Faye Grant) for a more generic crowd, save the loyal and hard-working Don Cervantes.  This leads to some rather old and characterless students in Hinkley's class, but allows for the producers to not have to shoehorn them into episodes where they don't belong as much as in season two, for example.

The show really works in the 3rd season, cuz of the reason it worked the first two; Katt, Culp and Selleca were a great team, deserved better scripts than they usually got, and did the most with what they had.  If you like them, you'll like the show.  They're just as good here as ever, and it is nice that Ralph and Pam finally make it official in this season...

Plus, the final episode ever is the oddball ""Vanity Says the Preacher,"" written and directed by Culp.  It's kind of a mess, but very similar in tone and spirit to many of the great episodes he wrote for I SPY -- it's just that the budget wasn't there to do the episode ""right,""; but Culp fans will recognize the spirit and attitude in it, and it's worth a viewing, particularly since it never aired in the show's original network run.",1123200000,11,2056,4.490616621983914

i know this review might sound negative, but there were a couple of good episodes i intend on watching fairly regularly. the one with biker gang was funny and didn't waste anytime getting interesting. also, the one where Ralph goes into another dimension and a ghost tells him that the suit is no good here. Ralph has to take Bill into another dimension to get rid of the woman inside him that's possessing him and they both almost die. Good episode. it makes you think about the limitations of the suit.

From solving the murder of rival magicians in the episode entitled ""The Resurrection of Carlini"" to a blatant, absurdist jab at Dungeons & Dragons with ""Wizards & Warlocks"" featuring a kidnapped prince, who's father tasks Maxwell to find, however all logic flies out the window when Maxwell flashes his FBI badge only to find out that not only does anyone seem to care, but maintain that the only way they can assist in locating the lost Prince, is if they are on the same level in the game, and have passed the obstacles required, such as the ""River of Zog"", which happens to translate in the real world as being located in the LA storm drain.

The episode also features Bob Saget, and a whole slew of ""college students"" who are quite obviously pushing 40.

But I digress, The season three DVD is quite possibly the last time anyone will ever see this ingenious, and hilarious spoof on the Super hero genre, and is up to this day, unique in accomplishing just that.

From the brilliant mind of Stephen J. Cannell comes, The Greatest American Hero!",1122249600,6,1797,4.685714285714286
2194744,4,B0006SSP9O,"The real draw of the set for me are the incredible interviews found on Disc 6 of the set.  If you are a fan of ""The A-Team,"" ""The Rockford Files"" or even ""21 Jump Street,"" you must see these interviews!

I am a huge fan of Mike Post and his musical creations for Cannell's shows, so it is a real thrill to hear how the duo first met and the thought process for many of his themes (""Wiseguy,"" ""Silk Stalkings,"" and of course ""The Greatest American Hero"").  We get the same kind of thing from the interviews with Cannell as we find out how he got in the business and his thought process behind ""Rockford,"" ""The A-Team"" and more.

2194746,5,B0006SSP9O,"This show was probably the most original idea concieved by any network, had the best group of actors and actresses to fit the characters, and the best theme song. With that said, keep in mind that the show aired in 1981 and if your looking for some really cool special effects, crisp screen shots, or anything that compares to modern television shows then you should look at getting something else. If you can handle the fact that it was shot in 1981, then you can get past the camera shots, special effects, clothes, lingo, and everthing else and concentrate on watching a really great show.

I personally think this show should be brought back on the air and given a second chance. I felt totally ripped off when I was a kid when this show went off the air. Seeing these DVDs bring back a lot of memories. Cmon ABC, redo this show and get rid of the crap you're showing now.",1119916800,3,876,4.407407407407407

AS I READ IN A REVIEW ABOUT THIS SHOW. THE PILOT EPISODE. WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOW HINKLEY GIVING UP HIS SUIT TO A WOMAN. I NEVER SAW THAT IN THERE. BUT I HAVE'NT SEEN THE OTHER PILOT EPISODE.

2194748,5,B0006SSP9O,"""The Greatest American Hero"" is a short-lived superhero comedy show from the early 80's about a teacher (William Katt) who is given a super suit by space aliens.  Each week, he must team up with his girlfriend (Connie Sellecca) and a FBI agent (Robert Culp) to save the world as we know it.  The problem?  He lost the instruction book, so he has no clue what all he can do and how to control it.

The show only had one full season and this is it.  22 full episodes to be enjoyed.  Connie Sellecca is missing from five of the episodes near the beginning because she was having her first child.  This leaves a hole because I find the show is strongest while focusing on the interactions of the three leads.  Once she's back, the show begins to pick up steam and it gets better as it goes along.

Yes, the show is cheesy at times.  Yes, the special effects are obviously low budget for 20 years ago.  Do I care?  Nope!  We've got entertaining stories and great characters.  What else do I need?

I realized while watching this set just how little I remember about specific episodes.  Honestly, it was like watching a new show for me.  Which is one reason why any changes to the music for copyright reasons didn't bothered me.  I'm sure if I knew the show, these changes would be a problem, but I didn't notice at all.

This set includes six discs.  The episodes look good for their age, although effects shots and stock footage are often worse.  The sound won't challenge your system any, but it gets the job done.  Extras include interviews with creator Stephen J. Cannell and composer Mike Post.  These cover their careers and, while entertaining, don't add much to a discussion of this show.  Also included are a photo gallery and the screenplay and a Japanese language track for the season premier.

This show can have me laughing at the banter between characters one minute (there are some great one-liners) and worried about how they'll get out of the mess they're in the next.  I'm glad it came out on DVD at all so I can enjoy it for years to come.",1118707200,18,2053,4.436997319034853
2194749,5,B0006SSP9O,"I loved this show as an elementary schooler.it came on Wednesday Nights before The Fall Guy. MY brother used to put a towel for a cape and jump off of chairs pretending to fly. I only watched the opening credits,with Believe it or not. That song reminds me of If You Leave Me Now by Chicago.",1118188800,,291,4.214285714285714
2194750,5,B0006SSP9O,"When I read the ""Captain Bellybuster"" name in the episode titles I laughed so hard. I had completly forgotten about that episode and remembered the character was also mentioned on one of Cannell's other shows, the A-Team. Just remember ""Howling Mad"" Murdock wearing the Capt. Bellybuster winged ball cap!

Anyway, I had a great time after getting this set going back to 1981/1982 and watching an episode of this show every night before turning in. In this set we get Ralph's original last name back, ""Hinkley."" It was changed to ""Hanley"" in the first season due to the assassination attempt on Pres. Reagan by a man with a similar last name John Hinckley. We also get a love interest for Bill Maxwell only she (Dixie Carter) turns out to be a spy. We get Bill's hilarious lothing of agent Carlisle (William Bogert). And, we meet Ralph's mom as she is engaged to a sleezy con man. Ralph tries to stop WW3, fights voodoo, gets electrfied, pitches a 200 mph fastball. I also noticed that Cannell experimented with a certain catch phrase by giving it to Ralph for a couple eps. Finally Cannell gave the catch phrase ""works for me"" to Sgt. Rick Hunter.

In the extras we get More interviews from Stephen J. Cannell and the show's song composer Mike Post. Also there's a photo gallery, ""200 MPH Fast Ball"" in Japanese, and the DVD ROM has the script for ""200 MPH Fast Ball.""

My pet peeves were that there were no teasers for each episode. That took away from the experience of watching it on Wednesday nights. I'd see the exciting teaser then the theme song would start. That for me is huge in the world of nostalgia. The other was mentioned before... The omition of the cover of ""Eve of Destruction"" from the episode ""Operation: Spoilsport."" This was my favorite episode as a kid and not having that song just seemed to suck the life out of this episode for me... When I turned it on and they played a different song when the radio dedicated a song to Ralph I was scratching my head. Then Ralph called Bill and said that the song was ""Eve of Destruction!"" Then for the rest of the ep. they kept playing that substitute song and it just wasn't the same. Operation: Spoiled Episode... It didn't bother me as much when they omitted ""Rocket Man"" from the pilot but this was just wrong.

But I still love this series and my 5 star rating stands. However the song omittions get 1 star. Now anxiously awaiting the release of season 3!",1118016000,4,2423,4.525114155251141
2194751,5,B0006SSP9O,"I loved the Greatest American Hero when it first came out. I was 11 and Superman II had come out that same summer. So I was all superhero'd up that year. Now I loved Superman II that year but the Greatest American Hero used a new and different approach to the super hero genre. Ordinary special ed teacher Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) takes his class to the desert on a field trip when the van mysteriously stops working. He hikes up the road to find help when he runs into FBI agent Bill Maxwell (former 'I Spy' man Robert Culp). He gives Ralph a lift but the car like the van mysteriously shuts off and they are met by an alien space ship (with ""little green guys""). Ralph and Bill are chosen to help make the Earth a better place as Ralph is given a red super suit. Unfortunatly, Bill is spooked by the little green guys and takes off leaving Ralph with the magic ""jammies."" As Ralph is cussing out Bill for leaving him there he drops the instruction book in the desert by the side of the road... So now we have a reluctant super hero who doesn't know how is super suit works. Bill shows back up to help Ralph help him solve his FBI cases. Ralph's divorce lawyer and girlfriend Pam Davidson (Connie Sellecca) also joins their team. A great chemistry between the three as I couldn't wait for every Wednesday night to watch! Was funny to also see the hang up the network had at that time on using the last name Hinkley for our hero. Sounded too much like John Hinckley, the man who shot Ronald Reagan that same year. So for the remainder of the first season Ralph's last name was ""Hanley."" June Lockhart's (Pam's mom)dialogue was edited when they were at the airport. Everytime she said ""Hinkley"" it was muffled by the sounds of jets flying by.

While I have all these great memories of the show there are some things they changed. Any song that was a cover was deleted and subbed with an original new song. Ex. ""Rocket Man"" was replaced in the pilot. It wasn't like these were the original artists. They were covered by Mike Post with Joey Scarbury on vocals.

The Extras are wonderful as there are interviews with William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, Michael Pare, and creator Stephen J. Cannell. Also featured is the 1986 spin off pilot, the Greatest American Heroine (which never aired) where Ralph becomes a world wide celebrity and is asked by the little green guys to give up the suit to a sucessor.

He taught shcool and saved the world on his free time. Robert Culp has always been one of my favorites and he can play drama and comedy both so very well.  The epsiodes were well written, the acting was very good and it came from an age when there was no such animal as a reality series.  People were creative then.  Ralph was and always will be the Greatest American Hero on TV.  Watch and have fun!",1117670400,3,557,4.19811320754717
2194753,5,B0006SSP9O,"Having the wonderful opportunity to view this long-departed series' first season on DVD is well worth the price of admission.

Nearly 25 years ago, Stephen J. Cannell produced the offbeat superheroic satire, ""The Greatest American Hero,"" which holds up surprisngly well today in terms of its storylines, acting, and special effects. In fact, ""Hero"" may well be Cannell's most underrated (and most exuberant) series he has ever produced.

The series premise: Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) is a young, idealistic high school special ed. teacher who reluctantly fights the good fight for the good ol' USA using a ""super-suit"" (complete with red leotards and a blue cape) bequeathed to him by a mysterious alien race.  Ralph's first major problem is that he loses the instruction book to the suit, so he will have have to learn how to use his extraordinary new powers all on his own.

Aided by sardonic FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) and Ralph's girlfriend/attorney, Pamela Davidson (Connie Selleca), bumbling Ralph learns the ropes about saving the world while attempting to keep his career and personal life reasonably normal.  Yet, much like his inept flying efforts, Ralph won't find this task easy and will continually question why the aliens chose him.  Hence, the lyrics from the show's hit theme song ""Believe it or Not"" summarize Ralph's ambivalent feelings superbly.

The DVD Edition:

Disc 1 Episodes:
1. ""The Greatest American Hero"" (pilot): 5 *****
2. ""The Hit Car"": 4 1/2 ****
3. ""Here's Looking at You, Kid"": 4 1/2 ****

Disc 2 Episodes:
1. ""Saturday Night on Sunset Boulevard"": 4 1/2 ****
2. ""Reseda Rose"": 4 1/2 ****
3. ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys"": 5 *****

Disc 3 Episodes:
1. ""Fireman"": 4 ****
2. ""The Best Desk Scenario"": 4 ****
3. ""The Greatest American Heroine"": 2 1/2 **

Overall, excellent!  There really isn't a weak link in Season One.  The feature-length pilot episode and ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,"" (featuring a cameo appearance by ex-""Lone Ranger"" star John Hart) are probably the best among them.  Further, the product's packaging clearly identifies each episode's plot, including a neat instruction booklet providing info and fun trivia questions about the series.

Among the special features on Disc 3 are lengthy interview segments with Stephen J. Cannell, William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, and Michael Pare (who portrayed one of Ralph's rebellious students).  Each of them share some intriguing insights and anecdotes about their participation throughout the show's three-year run, and why the show deserves to be fondly remembered.

An added bonus feature is the unaired ""Greatest American Heroine"" one-shot episode, which features Ralph and Pam's exit from the series while Bill is left resigned to groom Ralph's energetic heir to the ""super-suit.""  Unfortunately, watching ""Heroine"" will remind you why the Katt / Selleca /Culp trio gave the original series the magical chemistry it deserved, and that substituting someone else for Ralph simply doesn't work in this unique formula.

For what it is worth, we highly recommend Season One of ""The Greatest American Hero"" for audiences of all ages!",1117670400,4,3162,5.176817288801572
2194754,5,B0006SSP9O,"If you don't know much about  this particular series, it is not completely surprising.  This series had some rough starts and a rough run overall. The show is about a school teacher named Ralph Hinkley who inherits a super-suit from aliens.  With help from Bill Maxwell, an FBI agent, and his girlfriend Pam Davidson, he is able to use his suit to ""capture the bad guys"" with amazing abilities.

The show was intended to be a kind of comic book comedy. Ralph loses the instruction manual when he first receives the suit so he has to figure out how to use it as he goes along. Of course, the flying ability was originally one of the most ""comical"" of his powers.

The nice thing about the show was that it is family oriented. There is little to no foul language (Sometimes Ralph and Bill say ""Damn"", but that's about the strongest word in the series) and silly violence when Ralph throws the crooks around.

You never know what kind of powers Ralph will inherit from the suit, so anything could happen as the writers went along and continued to think up new ideas on what Ralph could do.

There were two big problems about the show. The first was that it became a major target for DC comics Warner Bros to sue over the similarity to Superman. That was an ongoing battle worthy of a comic book story in itself. The other problem was a tragic coincidence. Right when the show was beginning, that was when President Reagan had an attempted assasination by a real life man named ""Hinkley"". So the producer decided to briefly change Ralph's last name to HANLEY. But after a while it went back to HINKLEY. Ralph had some kind of temporary identity crisis.

Robert Culp is hilarious as Bill Maxwell and really is the best character on the show. William Katt is your typical American caring JOE ANYONE. Connie Selleca is beautiful even today.

The show really didn't last long on the air. the first season was very short. The second season was a full season of episodes. The third season was cancelled halfway through the run. The show was rarely shown in reruns, so many people don't even remember the show anymore. But many people probably still remember the theme song, BELIEVE IT OR NOT because it was a big hit on the radio. Its one of the few times a theme song became a bigger hit than the show.

If you are wondering about purchasing the show, I would recommend it as a fun, safe family entertaining show. The effects are cheesy but the stories are decent. It takes me back to the early 80s when I would watch the show religiously.

The show was meant for laughs and it succeeded in that. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1116201600,45,2624,4.445833333333334
2194755,3,B0006SSP9O,"Not the stuff you put up your nose, but really good clean fun.  I remember watching this on my summer holidays aged either 8 or 9.  We seemed to air the show during the day and until I bought it again on Amazon I remembered specific details of it only vaguely, although clearly enough to realise the impact it had on me as a kid.....I loved it.... especially now watching it as an adult and understanding the jokes and the character interaction.  Thanks for explaining the Hanley, Hinkley problem not being from the US I had forgotten the Reagan connection.  Highlights of this SEASON feature ' the shock will kill you' where Ralph is electrified and magnetic and attracts kitchen utensils.....really silly but very witty, 'Operation Spoilsport' is very good especially two scenes, Ralph scaring the wits out of a poor lady whilst searching for the missing scientist and Bill (High as Kite) on truth agent.  The two episodes in the Carribean do stretch the bounders a bit, but having said that this was a show about an alien suit.  My favourite has to be 'Lilacs Mr Maxwell'.  Having loved Robert Culp since I was a little girl it was wonderful to watch something of quality that he had written and directed.  Any one watching it will definitely see a distinct gear change in terms of irony and the texture of the language used.  I Spy fans will also see traces of two episodes he also wrote in this Mirror Mirror and Court of the Lion.  All in all this was a great wee series with lots of adventure, humour and dramatic tension.

However it's a hoot, lots of fun, presents the liberal and whacky school teacher, his beautiful lawyer girlfriend, and the rock solid FBI agent very well.  It's a fond return to the days when some of the worst problems the schools had to face was chewing gum and talking out of turn in class.

Re. the klutzy stuff re. super powers - it's fun to analize and disect with kids who've grown up on the perfection of Power Rangers, Yu-Gi-Oh and the Fantastic 4 quality of super heroes.

2194761,1,B0006SSP9O,"I was as excited as every other fan when The Greatest American Hero was released on DVD, but after seeing the changes made to it I just feel sick. I should have taken the fact that ""Rocket Man"", and ""Help me Rhonda"" were replaced on the soundtrack of the first season as a warning, but I never dream that the ""Eve of Destruction"" would be removed from the episode Operation: Spoilsport.
I never made it past this episode on the DVD. I had even said to my wife as the title music played that this was my favorite episode. God only knows what expresion I had on my face after the scene where the aliens first send Ralph the message on the radio only to hear some peice of garbage track that isn't good enough for elevator music, never mind providing the emotional drive for an episode about a possible nuclear war.
I felt like I'd been sucker punched in the gut.
This is just short changing the fans to try to made a quick buck.  I would have gladly paid any price to get this series in it's complete form on DVD, but obviously the company that release this collection were to cheap to fork out the cost of paying for the right to use the songs that were in the original series.
I have cancelled my pre-order on season three and won't be buying anymore products from the company that released this mess, and I have emailed them to tell them as much.",1113609600,15,1347,4.2823529411764705
2194762,1,B0006SSP9O,"I am not one to write reviews but I felt I had to warn the public to think twice before purchasing this DVD set.  I am a huge fan of this show but even I am upset about the finished product that was released to us.  I was thrilled when I heard all three seasons of the show were going to be released this year and even purchased this set myself thinking that it would be a great addition to my DVD library.  However, once I started to watch each episode, my excitement level diminished.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  Those who are fans of the show and remember the original run in 1982 know what I mean.  I was 11 when the show aired and remember begging my parents to let me stay up late so I could watch each episode.

Now a new generation of fans are appearing and I feel they will not get the same thrill I did when I saw the show for the first time.  Yes, I'm grateful that the show is even being released at all on DVD after years of practically begging Stephen Cannell to release them but I never expected what they would actually give to us.

The clarity and quality of the episodes is amazing.  I have copies of each episode that are grainy and dull.  What I saw on the DVD set was remarkable, like I was watching the episode live.  The same excitement was there in most of the episodes as I relived the chemistry between the main characters (Ralph, Bill and Pam).

However, OPERATION SPOILSPORT was a travesty.  I don't mind not having the original songs to the other episodes but this episode needed the song ""Eve of Destruction"" because the song was centered around the episode.  At least have the courtesy of cutting out the scene where Ralph tells his partner Bill that they played Eve of Destruction for him because new fans will be confused with the song replacement.  It totally ruined that episode for me and does a disservice to the artist, Joey Scarbury.

I would try to find a way to purchase original versions of this Season rather than wasting your money on this set.",1113523200,10,2010,4.317333333333333
2194763,5,B0006SSP9O,"THE GOOD:
This season contains some of the best episodes of the show.
Stephen J. Cannell's writing team produced some truly fantastic storylines, brilliantly blending drama with hilarious comedy. Just watch the first 3 episodes of this season and I bet you'll watch the rest. Mike Post and Pete Carpenter are musical masters who likewise really knew what they were doing. The end result was a truly great show. The quality is good. Some of the artifacts present during the last cable broadcast I saw are gone and the show looks and sounds really good. The interviews and inlcusion of an original script in .pdf are a nice bonus.

THE BAD:
Once again, the teasers leading into the show are sadly absent. This show had some of the best teasers and really made you want to watch the show. If you compared Knight Rider's teasers to the GAH you'd see what I mean. Ralph's hair AGAIN is redish on the DVD cover instead of blonde.

THE UGLY:
For those who don't know, every single song that wasn't originally written for the show has been replaced with new generic music even though the music had been redone by the Post/Carpenter/Geyer team for the original show. Even though I don't remember what song was originally in every episode I can easily tell what has been changed as the DVD seems noticeably lacking. This results in a real loss in the show, minorly watering down some scenes while ENORMOUSLY changing others.

Yanking ""Rocket Man"" and other songs from season 1 was bad enough. The original creators of this show were some of the best ever. They integrated the visual film with a splendid audio score resulting in some very fine viewing. Film making is an art and butchering up the original score is like altering a a famous painting.

 ""Operation: Spoilsport"" had one of the most effective and best cinematic sequences I have seen and replacing the re-done ""Eve of Destruction"" (which was an integral part of the episode) with the blah new ""end of the world"" (or whatever it was) ruined it. All the musical timing, the tension, build-up and feeling was totally lost. The removal of the redone ""It's a beatiful morning"" from the end basically removed the humorous and satisfying end of the episode. I still have part of several episodes on tape and when you compare the original form of the show to the new one, the latter pales in comparison when it comes to musical effectiveness as I and others agree.

I do not intend to insult the artists that provided the new ""replacement"" music as the songs are good enough in their own right but simply cannot compare to the original finished product of how the show was supposed to be. Furthermore, I understand why the music was changed. I would gladly have paid $10 or more for the quality DVD set containing the show in it's original and un-molested form but the success of this release was most likely questionable and they didn't want the extra expense and complexities required to retain the copyrighted material. I don't know how good the sales are nationally but every time I go to the store the GAH is sold out whereas most of the other shows still have copies on the shelf. Too bad most of those people won't get the full experience of the show.

CONCLUSION:
I give the musical butchering and absence of teasers a 1/5 but I will still give Anchor Bay a 5 for bringing out a quality release of an old show that I never expected to see on DVD. If you haven't seen it I still recommend watching it as even though it is not nearly as good as it was supposed to be, it is still a very good show. If you haven't seen it in a long time, you'll still like it. Though VERY unlikely, I wish they'd release the show with original music and I'd buy those even though I've already spent over $50 on the two seasons. Then I'd use my other DVDs for coasters.

04-19-05: Thinking about this some more I wanted to add that because of seeing this show in it's correct and original form years ago I bought music CDs due to hearing music that was used in the show, music that no longer is in the show and many people will miss out on. That will result in a potential loss of sales to record companies from future customers that might have done as I did and bought the songs they heard in the show.
And on another note..unlike Miami Vice and other shows where they simply had music in the background that often could be replaced with other music, the songs in GAH were tied into the particular episode and related to what was happening. New viewers will not know what they are missing.",1113264000,6,4522,4.5060975609756095
2194764,5,B0006SSP9O,"I've been reading several of the reviews lowering the overall rating of season 2. I understand the dissapointment of many fans that the soundtrack as been changed. However I also realize that its not always up to the company (Anchor Bay) concerning what they have liscense to add to a DVD. I'm just glad that they found a way to release it in the first place. I remember watching this show as a child and never understood why it was gone so quickly. More resently I've learned of the issues with Hinckley/Hanley (that i failed to notice as a child). As well as the issue with Warner Brothers  (who have no concept of what DVD content should be) & DC comics concerning the alleged Superman concept rip off. I mean come on....Superman & Hinckley.....lol. He would have been more of a Clark Kent rip off if you ask me. On to my point. At the time of this review S2 is only getting 2 1/2 out of five stars. I know this is a show that most of the negative reviewers loved & understand they are reviewing the quality of this release and not the actual show. However you must understand that overall it is the show that is getting the less than deserved rating. Please people, rate the Show first...then put any notes about DVD quality in your review. Show your love for a lost treasure. I give it 5 stars when I would have given it 4 just to try and bring up the rating.

2194765,5,B0006SSP9O,"...if this series is ever made into a modern movie?

The production company that does it, that's who.

In fact, I'm surprised that none have done so in the last twenty years. Guess they're all obsessed with finding the next boring women's lib-ass tomb raider or something. I truly feel for them.

But I can guarantee you that sometime during the next decade, someone is going to be stepping up in the role of Ralph Hinkley, donning a geeky red suit, and making millions of new fans say to themselves ""Hey, finally something ORIGINAL!""

Just like they did in the 80's, but were too scared to say it.

Btw, how the hell did they make that UFO look so damn real in the early 80's when even with CGI, most scifi (cough) movies these days look completely fake??

Hmmm...",1113004800,5,765,4.467625899280575
2194766,4,B0006SSP9O,"This review is aimed at the complaints that have dogged the release of this show on DVD, specifically the omission of the cover songs by Joey Scarbury.

First of all, the picture and sound quality remastered for these DVDs are excellent. Real care was taken with the presentation of these episodes. The Greatest American Hero was not a huge television phenomenon, but it does have a very strong cult following (that I am a part of), so the fact that Anchor Bay took it on and released it amazes me, though they are known for their catalog of cult faves. This is the first time the show has ever been released in any format, and it hasn't run in any form of syndication for years, as far as I know. In essence, the show was over.

When I was a kid, I would tape the episodes' music on blank cassette tapes, which I still have, so Scarbury's music is very important to my memory of the show.

But here's a dose of reality to the naysayers. This DVD set would have had a budget, and most likely not a very huge one due to the very questionable profit margin this show could generate. This is not Miami Vice, or The Cosby Show, or even The Brady Bunch, this was a small show, so it most likely had a small budget. So Anchor Bay gives this budget to the producers and the producers have to decide where best to put the money for a proper release. Well, the rights to the cover songs, as you probably have guessed, have slightly skyrocketed since 1981. So, picture this, you can either put a large chunk of your budget towards a top-notch remastering job (I once watched a tape of the pilot at the Museum of Television and Radio, and it was a pretty terrible copy, I can only imagine what the source tapes are like, but it had all the original music (!)) or you can exhaust your funds towards paying off the huge cost of licensing and not have much left over for remastering it properly. The third option is not releasing the show at all. I, myself, am happy to have the show released and understand the financial dilemma the producers of the DVD were most likely facing. Again, I'm quite sure that the producers did not have the budget Universal gave the producers for Miami Vice, which was a sure thing in terms of turning over a profit. Miami Vice had the luxury of paying million of dollars to the licensors to make sure each and every song was kept. I'm sure The Greatest American Hero did not.

That said, Anchor Bay's biggest screw-up was the lack of a disclaimer on the DVD box claiming that some music has been altered, and they should be held accountable for that as it is false advertising. It is my hope that future DVD or even HD pressings of this show, after it has shown a significant profit, will have the original music re-inserted, but who knows? All of Joey Scarbury's original music has not been touched, however, and is present on the DVD sets.

Please also keep in mind that The Greatest American Hero is at least fifteen dollars cheaper than Miami Vice with more discs, and don't even get me started on how much HBO charges for their DVD sets with very few extras.

I give four stars for the overall presentation of the set, with one omitted for the missing songs but most of all to false advertising. For those of you foaming at the mouth and expect millions of dollars to be thrown at your favorite TV show without a thought as to what cost vs return means, please take a moment to at least be thankful that the show got released at all, and most of all, get a grip on reality.",1113004800,10,3496,4.337920489296636
2194767,1,B0006SSP9O,"This was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I'm thrilled to finally be able to own it on DVD.  However, the powers that be have seen fit to save a few pennies and remove songs that were originally featured in the show.  What's worse, the songs removed were not even originals - they were cover songs performed by a different vocalist (Joey Scarbury).  I do not see the reason for this, and I do not see the point in you buying an 'altered' set.  Find a way to obtain the original thing.",1112918400,11,489,4.11578947368421
2194768,1,B0006SSP9O,"How could this happen?  How could someone create a show so great only to complete destroy certain episodes with the DVD release by CHANGING THE MUSIC, THE MUSIC BEHIND THE REASON MANY OF US FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SHOW TO BEGIN WITH?!

Stephen J. Cannell created this show, so I assume he must be behind the changes made to it for the DVD release.  The chopping up of the cover songs in the season one DVD was bad enough - this is beyond horrible.  Do not buy this set.  Find a way to get your hands on the original versions.",1112918400,9,523,4.138613861386139
2194769,1,B0006SSP9O,"I have always loved this show...the special fx may not be groundbreaking (even for the '80s) but the show has a charm all its own.

When I bought the season one set, I really didn't notice the music changes...when thinking about season 2, I knew there was one episode that the producers would just HAVE to go the extra mile for ""Operation Spoilsport"" with its INTEGRAL use of the song ""Eve of Destruction""  Needless to say I was outraged to see that the song was indeed replaced with some generic pop drivel that doesn't fit in with the episode and is indeed painful to listen to..Ralph even says the name of the song that's supposed to be playing so it definitely takes you out of the episode.

It's making me really question my decision to purchase these sets and make me unsure whether to buy season 3 or, indeed, to sell of seasons 1 and 2.",1112918400,9,844,4.397435897435898
2194770,1,B0006SSP9O,"Loved the show originally, now w/ the replacement music, things just aren't the same - these classic episodes have been marred, especially Operation Spoilsport - I can barely stand to watch the shows now.  I was so looking foward to finally having this dvd collection to relive these shows how they were NOT how they were re-edited to save a buck.  Plus, for the price they are asking per dvd set you'd think they paid some music licensing.  Thumbs down to Anchor Bay and the shows producers who allowed this.  Contact them and demand a re-issue.",1112832000,6,546,4.65625
2194771,1,B0006SSP9O,"I guess the powers that be figured they could make enough money just from those of us who bought this set before knowing about the removal of the cover songs.  I had hoped that since Joey Scarbury sang these songs-unlike Rocket Man and Help Me Rhonda from season 1-that they could get around the whole license problem.  Or maybe they'd come to their senses after seeing that Miami Vice season 1 kept all its songs; so it could be monetarily feasible.  But nooooo!!  You can forget about the days when the customer was always right.  The manufacturer does not cater to the consumer, rather the opposite actually.  And all of our protests won't even reach their deaf ears.  Even if many, many people decide not to buy this set from what we've written here, the corporations will easily make up the difference in selling some other hot dvd title.  It is a sad time indeed when we have so many things to buy, but everything is sub-par in some way.  This was one of my favorite shows.  In my dreams, when I was a kid, I had to take three running steps before I could fly.  Ralph was a role model for me.  This show touched my young heart and mind.  And Operation: Spoilsport was its highpoint.  It was the realization of everything good about the series.  It was funny, while being dramatic and suspenseful.  It was about an ordinary man fighting the will of a corrupt government official.  And Scarbury's rendering of the classic Bob Dylan song Eve of Destruction was what made it work.  The song is powerful.  And it is just as true today as it was when Dylan wrote it.  ""The eastern world, it is exploding; violence flaring, bullets loading..""  For those who don't understand why the original music is so important, let me say that music defines generations.  Songs are not just something to dance to or hum along with, they are anthems.  Each and every one of us has a song that we feel defines us, or our lives at a particular time and place.  These songs were put into tv shows for this very reason.  Music touches us in a way that nothing else can.  Think of the music for Jaws, or Psycho, Star Wars, Superman.  The most of a change we can hope for is that these corporations will start putting warning labels on dvds.  ""Contains changes from original soundtrack""  They were quick to slap labels on Heavy Metal tapes and cds.  Let's see how responsive they'll be to this.  But someone would need to start such a movement.  Who's with me?",1112745600,16,2439,4.472727272727273
2194772,2,B0006SSP9O,"After getting the second season, and watching the first episode, I was very excited and satisfied. The picture and sound quality was great.  Then I skiped to ""Operation Spoil Sport"" so see if the original music was still there, ""EVE OF DESTRUCTION"".  IT WAS NOT.  That took away all the excitment I had towards the dvd set.  To me it is so STUPID to change anything, since we are paying for it in the end.  I am so angry that I can't describe it!!  Licencse agreement's or not, it does not make sence to change any content of the original. THEY CHEATED US!!! I can't empisize that enough.  Don't matter whay any copyright law or license agreement says, in the end They CHEATED US!!!  I would have easly given this 5 stars if it wasent' for them Butchering the original content and they are cheapskates for doing it!!!

Greatest American Hero - Season Three:
August 9th!",1112659200,6,2506,4.973621103117506
2194774,4,B0006SSP9O,"Boy if this show wasn't completely refelctive of everything that was good...and bad of the early 1980's I don't know what was.  We all know the story...high school teacher Ralph Hinkley (William Katt), later renamed Hanley, is given a suit complete with tights and cape that gives him tremendous super powers such as flight, strength, invisibility, etc, but he loses the instruction manual.  He joins FBI Agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) in using the suit to fight crime.  Rounding out the cast was Connie Selleca as Ralph's girfriend Pam, and Michael Pare and Faye Grant as two of Ralph's students Tony and Rhonda.

Season two comes with a full complement of all 22 episodes which would be the last full season of the show.  It would be canceled midway through season number three.  Season two continues in much the same pattern as the first with Agent Maxwell coming in with their assignments and Ralph still playing the reluctant hero.  It was always fun to see Ralph experiment with his powers, often with disatrous results.  And he still hadn't mastered flying as of yet.  In truth the formula did start to get a little old but was always entertaining and a fun little fantasy show.  Notable season two episodes incude:

""Hog Wild""  Ralph's suit is stolen by a motorcycle gang but find they cannot use it when one of their members attempts to fly and breaks his arm.  They kidnap Bill and force Ralph to commit their crimes.

""The Lost Diablo""  Bill has found a treasure map to the lost Diablo Gold mine and recruits Ralph and his class to help find it but thieves are already hot on the gold's trail.

""Train of Thought""  Ralph crashes into a train and promptly loses his memory.  After Pam and Bill fail to convince him about the suits powers, Ralph throws the suit in the garbage and they end up having to rummage through a dumpsite to find it.

""The Shock Will Kill you""  Ralph has to use his powers to rescue a space shuttle from crashing.  he becomes magnetized...very magnetized resulting in of the funnier episodes of the series.

""It's all Downhill from Here""  silly but fun.  Ralph impersonates a Russian Skier so the real one can defect to America and turn over secret documents.

""Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell""  Bill meets a female agent and immediately falls in love with her.  But she's a spy with a mission to kill him.

Greatest American hero never aspired to be too much which is why the show was so endearing to fans.  The chemistry between Ralph and Bill was always smooth as they played off each other's characters so well.  Nice to see a show like this on DVD.  I wonder if the third season will feature the un-aired episodes.  That would be great!",1112659200,9,2665,4.616204690831556

The official release date for this movie is 4/5/05 and you have posted reviews of musical content before anyone, and I do mean anyone, has had a chance to watch or review them. Personally, I'd never buy anything that is japanese. The japanese have perfected the pirating of films and tv series to almost perfection but I'd rather just buy the season 2 dvd's and see for myself. Also, many times when a movie is released on dvd and songs are changed it is often because of licensing agreements with the original artists and/or studios but I'm still skeptical that anyone that has posted a review of the soundtrack to this series before it even hits the video shelves would know anything about the musical content.

In CLASSICAL GAS, a silly but fun episode, Ralph's students sing BRASS IN POCKET at a Woodstock type festiveal while he fights crime -- not now -- they've cut ALL frontal shots of Faye Grant singing, and repeated one shot of the back of her head over and over, with a new lame song.  Again, many episodes are fine, and some others with song replacements aren't AS ruined as these 2 -- but these 2 (and SPOILSPORT is a fan favorite) are reallllly screwed.  Caveat emptor.

2194779,5,B0006SSP9O,"Pay no attention to the previous reviewer.  The show was in 1981, of course the effects weren't incredible.  But they were good for a TELEVISION show of that time.  The episodes were funny and clean unlike some of the junk on television today.  It's one of my favorite television shows and I highly recomend it.",1112400000,5,311,4.6
2194780,5,B0006SSP9O,"The premise: ABC approaches big time TV producer/writer Stephen J. Cannell (known for car chase/action shows) to create a comedic superhero show with Superman style effects but on a TV budget. The result is one of television's most unsung greats- a show with enormous potential but never fully materialized to it's full ability due to inner struggles within the network top brass and the creaters.

Only a comedy on the outside, a deeper look reveals a drama as Ralph, a school teacher for troubled youth (like Welcome back, Kotter) is given a supersuit by aliens and the tremendous responsibility of helping mankind and occassionally saving the world. In addition to that he is teamed up with ""by the book"" FBI agent Maxwell who is his opposite in nearly every aspect.
The suit wreaks havoc on his personal life and Ralph struggles with his new-found and forced duties. As any loving american would, when a problem arises and only they can do something about it, the unlikely team does what must be done.

From the most basic viewer's standpoint it is a hilarious comedy. Nearly every power of the suit is discovered via a mishap. Ralph constantly crashes into TV antennas and anything else in his path as he ""navigates like hit by a can of Raid"".

From a writer's standpoint it's brilliant, chocked full of great dialog and layered elements dealing not only just the crime/action story of the episode but also the human condition.
The acting is superb as the viewer can actually feel what Ralph is going through. Robert Culp plays Agent Maxwell so well that he doesn't really seem like he's ""playing"" a character at all, but rather IS Maxwell.

The quality of transfer to DVD is excellent. The show looks better than it ever could have during the broadcast days. The only problem I have is the removal of some of the music originally in the show that does detract a bit from it.

Some of the effects don't look so good by today's standards but all in all the show still holds up very well. They did very well considering it was a TV show budget and some of the flying scenes are Superman (movie) caliber. Providing ample doses of comedy, action, drama, and effects, the Greatest American Hero is a show I definently recommend checking out. I eagerly await season 2 as it contained some of the best.",1112140800,2,2300,4.683168316831683

""Tell me about, kid.""

- Ralph Hinckley jokes to his girlfriend, Pamela Davidson, about his new part-time job, & bitches about the employee uniform, but, its up to a young boy to tell Ralph to suck it up, fly straight & become ""The Greatest American Hero""

From the creator of the ""A-Team"" & ""Hunter"" comes something you would never expect from this guy, Steven J.Cannell.

Ralph Hinckley is a history/english teacher who is newly in charge of the Special Ed. class - Juvenile Division. Before things get out of hand & Ralph gets killed, he decides to take the class on a fieldtrip to the desert, to study the wildlife & the deserts resources.

A teachers worst nightmare happens when the bus their traveling in, breaks down mysteriously. Ralph hoofs it on foot to find help and almost gets hit by an out of control car driven by Federal Agent, Bill Maxwell. While the boys argue about the rights of the road, an alien spacecraft descends and hovers in front them. Freaked out, both Bill & Ralph get in the car, getting locked in by the aliens. The aliens, through Bill's newly & very dead ex-partner, tells both men that they have been bestowed upon to save the planet and, if both men except, are given a black box in which a secret weapon is stored and can be used to aid them in their quest.

After the aliens take off, so does Bill, not excepting what he saw, ditching Ralph in the middle of the desert. Ralph hoofs it back to the bus & takes the kids back home. The next day Ralph decides to see what ""The Secret Weapon"" in the box is and its a.... pair of red tights w/ matching boots and a black cape. Its a supersuit. Ralph looks for the instructions & learns that he has lost them. Bill has second thoughts & apologizes to Ralph at school, later that day. The boys figure out that Ralph is the one that wears the suit & takes down the bad guys, while, Bill uses his Federal Government know how to track criminals and aid Ralph anyway he can. Their first case is pretty obvious - findout who killed Bill's partner and why.

""The Greatest American Hero"" debuted on ABC Television in early 1981 (Ralph's last name was briefly changed to Hanley after the attempt on President Reagan's life by whack job extreme John Hinckley). ""Hero"" is one of those underated show's of the 80's (I'm not even sure if the show was broadcast in syndication).

As for the DVD set of the 1st season, all eight episodes are included with Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (it says stereo, but, don't believe it). Also included are new cast interviews from Stephen J. Cannell, William Katt, Connie Selleca, Robert Culp, and Michael Pere.

Supersuit.... given by aliens.

Instructions..... lost forever.

Being ""The Greatest American Hero""..... priceless.",1110067200,5,3083,4.47415329768271
2194784,5,B0006SSP9O,"I was 10 when ""Superman"" was released in 1978, and like many kids that age, was very impressed with ""Superman.""

Fast-forward to 1981.  ABC ran commercials for ""The Greatest American Hero"" and I was hooked even before the pilot aired in March 1981.  I watched every episode during the show's brief run, and I missed out on seeing the show in syndication due to my having joined the Navy in 1986.

Television nostalgia formed the bulk of programming on the cable channel ""Nick At Night"" in the 1990s, and ""The Sci-Fi Channel"" also aired shows like ""The Six Million Dollar Man.""  I kept waiting for one of those channels to air ""The Greatest American Hero.""

Imagine my surprise as I walked through my local video store and saw the DVD cover with Ralph (William Katt), Pam (Connie Selleca) and Bill (Robert Culp) on it.  My favorite show as a kid was on DVD? I could hardly believe it.  I took my purchase home and became a kid again as I watched the show.

The season one DVD contains all the episodes of that season, including the pilot from 1981 and, worth the price of the DVD alone, the unaired pilot of ""The Greatest American Heroine"" from 1986, which reunited the cast.  In this pilot, Ralph is finally revealed to the world as a superhero, and all of the attention inflates Ralph's ego.  The aliens who gave Ralph the suit returned and demanded Ralph find a replacement.  The show was to air on NBC, but never did.

So, how does the show hold up after 25 years?  Pretty well, actually, aside from plots involving Russians and the cold war.  For a low-budget show, the special effects were effective, and Ralph's flying scenes hold up well.  Not as well as the flying scenes from 1978's ""Superman,"" but still fun to watch.

The premise: Ralph Hinkley, a liberal high-school teacher, finds himself lost in the California desert.  Also lost is conservative FBI agent Bill Maxwell.  While in the desert an alien spacecraft arrives, informing Ralph that he would be granted a suit to give him incredible powers to help mankind -- and would have to work with Maxwell.  The suit would only work on Ralph.  After receiving the suit, Ralph loses the instruction book.  Much of the humor of the show involved Ralph trying to figure out how to be a superhero.  Katt's Hinkley is an instantly likeable character, suddenly thrust into the role of unlikely hero; Culp's Maxwell is your typical 1980s G-man, played straight by Culp, although he adds a touch of humanity to Maxwell's tough-guy image.  The pair are joined by Ralph's girlfriend Pam (Connie Seleca), an attorney who, like Ralph, has a hard time coming to grips with the whole superhero idea.

The trio have great chemistry, which makes for an engaging series.  And it's great fun to discover, with Ralph, what powers he has with the super-suit.  He can fly, but unlike Superman, Ralph has a tendency to crash into buildings, people, or the ground (Ralph doesn't quite get the hang of flying).  As the series progressed, Ralph started to figure out what powers he had.

Included in this DVD set is 75 minutes of current interviews with the cast, another great bonus feature.

Soon, season two will be released, and will offer up more nostalgia for those of us in our late 30s who tuned in to every single episode of ""The Greatest American Hero.""",1109980800,15,3299,4.657439446366782
2194785,4,B0006SSP9O,I don't remember the differences the previous post mentioned.  It seemed to me to be the same as the originals I watched years ago - but then I was a kid so I can't really say.  I picked this up the second I saw it.  I watched them all.  It was great!  Wish they had more special features but all in all.  I loved having them on DVD.  I can chuck my VHS tapes now.  :),1109980800,2,368,3.75
2194786,5,B0006SSP9O,"Back in 1981, The Greatest American Hero was THE show to watch on ABC. William Katt's Ralph Hinkley (having lost the super suit's instruction manual) questioned ""the little green guys"" faith in him [and in the suit's design] and would hilariously fumble to save the day. Katt's chemistry with co-stars Robert Culp as scene-stealing patriot FBI agent Bill Maxwell and gorgeous Connie Sellecca as Ralph's attorney girlfriend (later wife) Pam Davidson were definitely among the show's strengths. As were those nifty 80s special effects! The super strength, the flying, the super sight and Ralph and Bill's close encounter with the little green guys still look impressive, for 80s effects. And it's still fun watching Ralph run at super speed to the sound of a speeding locomotive.

While such memorable cover songs such as ""Rocket Man"" did not make it onto the DVD set, the once No. 1 hit opening theme song ""Believe It, Or Not"" written by Mike Post & Stephen Geyer and performed by series vocalist Joey Scarbury is included before each episode and in the main menu. In addition to the Scarbury-performed songs that are included in the set, you still get the show's original incidental ""Believe It, Or Not"" style action music and cues by veterans Mike Post & Pete Carpenter that set the show's tone.

Despite the omission of a few songs, Anchor Bay did a great restoration job with the set while Cannell and his three principles and one supporting cast member provide highly entertaining and informative interviews. Nice touch with ""Instructions"" booklet, too.

2194787,4,B0006SSP9O,"I loved this show when it came out.

So much so that I kept many of the episodes on VHS tape.

That is why I was so excited to be able to get it all on DVD.

But then comes the dissapointment. They changed a great deal of the music!

For example: The very first time Ralph uses the suit, Elton John's song, Rocket man is supposed to be heard..., it fit perfectly. Not on the dvd however, they replace it with some lame song that does not fit at all. And they did this in several places. Action scenes are filled with what seems like elevator music.

 Hey, charge us a few bucks more and keep it like it was!

  Bottom line - Characters and story still great but sound changes took away from the experience!",1109462400,10,706,4.094890510948905

I didn't think I would like watching the series that much, but I can't stop. As fun as it was back in the 80's.

Can't wait for seasons 2 and 3!",1109289600,4,315,3.830769230769231
2194789,2,B0006SSP9O,"I am sad to say that whoever was responsible for removing the GREAT cover tunes has just ruined the DVD experience for me. I would have gladly paid more to keep the entire show intact. I did watch the interviews and some of the episodes, but the show does not feel the same to me anymore...
I feel that Anchor Bay and other companies should put a label on the box letting them know that the music has been changed. The sound effects have been changed too... Roseita Rose is a prime example here.
After Ralph Flies Lenny to one of the ledges of Techotron, he flies up one more to question the guy. We hear a big thump as he landed higher up! Anther scene is where Ralph throws open the door and the silencer sound was clearly added in to cover up the original sound that was there before.
I am going to stick with my old cassettes until a company can come out with the show as it was originally... Makes me sad that the shw was hacked all because of royalties. I can now call my childhood memories dead...",1109289600,11,1004,4.2072538860103625
2194790,5,B0006SSP9O,"When I first learned that this show was being released on DVD, I was  overcome by feelings of nostalgia and began singing ""Believe It Or Not"" over and over again in my head.  The problem was, I loved this show as a kid.  I was maybe 10 or so, and 10 year olds like ANYTHING on TV, especially superheros.  There have been dozes of movies that I have watched in the past few years that I loved as a kid, but I now realize how rediculous and horrible most of them were.  I was afraid that the same would be true of ""The Greatest American Hero"".

Even while aprehensive, I had to own it.  Let me tell you, my fears were unfounded.  This show catered to everyone, from 10 year olds wanting to watch superheros - to adults who wanted to watch an entertaining, witty show that wasn't afraid to take itself too seriously.  I loved it then, and I love it now.  Can't wait for season II.",1109116800,7,877,4.166666666666667
2194791,5,B0006SSP9O,"Schoolteacher Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) is taking his class on a field trip to the desert when their bus breaks down.  Hiking back to get help, he finds FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp).  His car also mysteriously dies just as a flying saucer appears.  Not to worry, they come in peace.  In fact, they want to help create peace on earth by giving Ralph a suit that will give him super powers.  Teaming up with Bill, he sets out to right the wrongs of the world.  Rounding out the trio is Pam Davidson (Connie Sellecca), Ralph's girlfriend.  Just one little problem.  Ralph lost the instruction book so has no idea how to control his powers.

Okay, I admit it.  It sounds cheesy and stupid.  But, if you'll buy the premise, it works and it works well.  The show is entertaining and sticks to it's premise well.  You do also have to get beyond the special effects.  Many of them, especially Ralph flying, look bad by today's standards.  But if you'll remember it was a TV show from 1981, you'll do just fine.

Collected here, we have the 8 episodes that were the first season, including the two-hour series premier.  During the episodes, not only does Ralph struggle with his new powers, but also with how to deal with them in his life.  And he truly struggles, most noticeably in ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys.""

And there is also lots of humor.  Great one-liners and slapstick as Ralph tries to figure things out.  I especially appreciate his constantly struggle changing out of his street clothes into his suit.  I can identify with that.  But the humor also comes from the characters.  Ralph is idealistic and Bill is cynical.  Bill also has little use for Pam, even when she provides a vital piece of information.  The three leads have great chemistry and pull things off admirably.  This is best shown in ""The Best Desk Scenario,"" easily my favorite in the set.

As mentioned, this season only consisted of 8 episodes.  They're preserved here on 3 discs.  The picture is sharp.  Obviously, they put lots of love into restoring it.  The sound is stereo.  Nothing fancy, but since the show is over 20 years old, it doesn't have to be.  Also included in this set is the only aired in syndication pilot for a proposed spin-off series, ""The Greatest American Heroine.""  I'm not a fan since it finds Ralph having to hand off the suit to someone else.  I'm a bit surprised it didn't get included in a season 3 set, since it serves as a coda to the series.  Still, it's nice to have somewhere for completion.  Rounding out this set is 75 minutes of new interviews with creator Stephen J. Cannell, the three stars, and Michael Pare, who played the leader of Ralph's students.  The interviews are interesting and well worth watching.

Did I mention you get the theme song?  You can't miss it since it plays on all the menus and, naturally, before each episode.  Honestly, I'm just as glad to get it as I am the episodes themselves.

I was slightly disappointed when I found out how few episodes there were in this season.  But for the price, you really can't complain.  I haven't been able to stop watching this set and am sorry to have finished it already.  Bring on season 2!",1109030400,45,3184,4.545936395759718
2194792,5,B0006SSP9O,"When The Greatest American Hero came on television in 1981, I was in the 4th grade.  I wanted to tune in for the same reasons anyone else who was between 6 - 13 wanted to tune in - it was a superhero.  Now, 24 years later, I picked up the DVD for nostalgia sake and discovered that there was a really good show underneath all of the special effects.  There were things about this show - Robert Culp's portrayal of Bill Maxwell for example, that I couldn't really appreciate when I was 9 years old.  The chemistry between Katt, Seleca and Culp is tremendous.  The bonus material for this DVD is also great and really gives you insight as to why the show was great and what caused it to fail down the stretch.  The best episodes of the entire series are in the first season.  Great writing, great cast and very well preserved considering how old the footage is.  (...)",1108944000,5,866,4.3354037267080745

Where is Family Ties? Barnaby Jones? Roseanne? Quincy? Bewitched? I cringe when I walk down the isle of any dvd seller and week in, week out, see stuff like the Greatest American Hero. Truly, I'm not trying to rain on anyones parade but TRY to look beyond nostalgia if possible. This, Full House, Saved By the Bell and countless other shows were simply ""filler"" of the time and were not meant to be viewed beyond the networks need for time killers. I honestly marvel at people paying money for these shows while true gems may never see the light of day.

I must add though, I LOVE Robert Culp though and love his work with real TV shows like Columbo.

Also, do not think I do not like ""light"" television. I currently own all of the Hanna Barbera sets, but I know the difference between ""light"" and ""light-weights"".",1108857600,2,826,4.530201342281879
2194794,5,B0006SSP9O,"This show is a classic.

Although plagued from the beginning by threats of lawsuits, time slot tinkering by ABC and a flap over the show's hero, Ralph Hinkley, sharing a last name with would be Reagan (...) John Hinckley, ""The Greatest American Hero"" is an underrated gem and one of the most imaginative TV series of the last 30 years.

The show has held up well and watching it now as an adult, I find that the series was both well acted and well written. Legendary TV producer Stephen J. Cannell was in fine form for this underappreciated series.

Highlights include the chemistry between the show's three leads, the fine performance of Robert Culp as gung ho FBI agent Bill Maxwell and Joey Scarbury's infectious title song, ""Believe It Or Not.""

Anchor Bay Entertainment has done a fantastic job mastering the program for DVD. The episodes look great! Also well worth viewing are the new interviews with Cannell, Culp, William Katt, Connie Sellica and Michael Pare.

Believe it or not, Ralph Hinkley and company are still walking on air. This show is a true delight!",1108771200,8,1070,4.762162162162162

But this is a fantistic DVD, it could have been made yesterday- the engineers have mastered this series to have a 2000+ look. The series has lost nothing, and its great to have my young boys,10 & 15 enjoying a series so much much which was made before they were born

10 out of 10 - Can't wait for season 2 !!",1108684800,7,479,4.095744680851064
2194796,5,B0006SSP9O,"First of all, AnchorBay did an AWESOME job for this dvd set. The opening intro, the re-mastering of footage, and cast interviews were all phenomenal. After getting the dvd sets for Buck Rogers and MacGuyer(which had ZERO extras and less than spectacular attention paid to film clean up) I wasn't expecting much. Die hard fans will be pleased.

  Don't want to get into the story, as many posts here have already done that. It's just one of those shows that, if you watched it when it originally aired, was that surprisingly good. The early 80's were the greatest time to be a kid,(Star Wars, Superman, Galactica, Buck Rogers, etc), and the GAH was extra dessert on a great meal(Who would've known at the time that William Katt almost landed the role of Luke Skywalker?) When I first saw the commercials, I just wanted to see a guy in a hero suit flying, but after watching the pilot, I liked regular guy Bill Maxwell a little more than whiny Ralph(Robert Culp in the role he was born to play). From always saying ""Scenario"", eating dog biscuits, and always finding a way to get Ralph to his bidding, Maxwell was the strength of the show. And Connie Selleca, Mamasita!! First Lynda Carter, and then Connie as the next hot blue-eyed, dark haired sci-fi vixen. She was hot and yet fit the role and story. Funny back story as she obtained one the suits to gave to her son(Gib, son of Connie and Buck Roger's Gil Gerard), to her daughter years later, then back to her son.

  Its a shame it got cancelled when it did, they were finally getting to do more shows about the 3-way relationship between Ralph, Pam, Bill, trying to establish new powers with suit, and getting more info on the ""green guys.""

  I think my only complaint with this dvd set the removal of Scarbury covers of ""Rocketman"" and ""Help me, Rhonda."" I know music companies are very anal about obtaining rights to use their songs these days, but come on! Hopefully with the sucess of this first dvd, that Cannell Co. might be willing to fork out a little more dough for the music. And here's to hoping they get audio commentary and interviews from Faye Grant, Don Cervantes, and the rest of the other semi-regulars from the show. Wasn't Jesse Goins one of Boddicker's gang members in Robocop I?(""ah, a new toy! Can I plaaay?"")",1108512000,7,2287,4.572127139364303
2194797,4,B0006SSP9O,"Although it's now fashionable to watch a superhero struggle with his or her abilities in movies and TV, it wasn't always the case. William Katt played Ralph Hinkley an ordinary guy who is left a gift from aliens from outer space-a suit that gives its wearer the ability to fly, super strength, invisibility and much more. Suddenly, he had all these super powers but lost the owner's manual to tell him how to use it correctly. Ralph ends up flying into walls and generally having as many mishaps as a superhero could possibly have. Befriended by FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) Hinkley partners with him and decides to fight for good. These first eight episodes (including the two hour pilot ) made up the first season of the series. The two hour pilot soars with nice comedic touches by Katt, Connie Selleca and the perfect straight man in Culp. In fact, Culp plays it so seriously that it comes off almost as a parody of a government agent.

With an exceptionally good transfer, ""The Greatest American Hero"" looks almost as if it was invulnerable to the ravages of time. The transfers look very nice with solid blacks and color reproduction. Considering the show is twenty five years old, there are few of the flaws that one might expect. The image is occasionally soft but and has some minor analog imperfections (such as dust, dirt particularly during the effects shots) on the whole, Anchor Bay has done a meticulous job in transferring this series to DVD. The sound while limited by the technology of the time (it was broadcast in mono) has good presence with the dialogue very clear. Some minor background hiss crops up from time to time. Although the box says this is in stereo it sounds like mono to me.

We get a pilot for a spin off entitled ""The Greatest American Heroine"". While only one episode was shot, what we have is quite good and promising. Sadly, no network picked up the spin-off so, until recently, it has sat on the shelf. In the spin off Hinkley hands off the suit to a young woman and she takes up where he left off. We also get interviews with stars William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Selleca and writer/producer/creator Stephen J. Cannell. Culp provides some interesting tidbits in his interview. For example, the reason Bill Maxwell comes across so intense and humorless is because Culp decided to play the role that way. He figured that there with others playing for laughs, presenting his character as serious would provide an anchor to reality and prevent the show from becoming too tongue-in-cheek. With over an hour of interviews, this portion of the set is extremely generous. No commentary tracks from anyone but, really, the interviews do make up for that. Hopefully in future sets we can have commentary tracks on key episodes by the actors and Cannell.",1108425600,99,2795,4.737166324435318
2194798,5,B0006SSP9O,I've been waiting so long for this to make it to dvd.  This is a magical and charismatic show. It's too bad Cannell couldn't cut a deal with Elton John on Rocketman which should be in the pilot episode.,1108425600,4,202,4.17948717948718
2194799,4,B0006SSP9O,"This is one of those shows that Kind of gets lost in your memory until some genius decides to throw it on DVD and surprise the heck out of everyone.  Oh Yeah!  THAT show!  Greatest American Hero was never a big hit and lasted only three seasons and 44 episodes.  But it's one of those shows that seems ingrained into our memories..the part of the memory that stores schlockey, cheesy fun.  Part of it certainly has to do with the very catchy theme song that was a hit in its own right and gained new fame when George Costanza used it as music for his answering machine on an episode of Seinfeld.

William Katt Stars as Ralph Hinkley (later renamed Hanley after the assasination attempt on President Reagan), a rather sheepish high school teacher who gets stuck with a class full of dilinquents led by Tony (Michael Pare).  Taking his students on a field trip out to the desert, thier bus mysteriously dies.  As Ralph walks back to a gas station he encounters FBI Agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) and a UFO.  The pair are informed by Bill's dead partner about a suit that grants its wearer great powers of strength, flight, invisibility, and more...Ralph reluctantly wears the Suit and joins with Maxwell to use the powers to fight evil.  Only problem is that Ralph lost the instructions for the suit so learning the powers becomes trial and error.

Season one had just 9 episodes including the pilot where Ralph got the suit.

""The Hit Car"" - Ralph and Bill must escort a mobsters girlfriend to court so she can testify against him.  Ralph has to fight off several attempts to stop them and then they find it was all a set-up.

""Here's looking at you kid"" - Pam's parents come for a visit, but before Ralph can even meet them Bill shows up to get his help to stop a group of rogue arms dealers. Ralph discovers the suits power of invisibility but has trouble controlling it.

""Saturday on Sunset Boulevard""  Bill enlists Raplh's aid, along with Ralph's students to track down a Soviet defector.  Also the students begin calling Ralph ""Mr. H"" as the Hinkley would be dropped or dubbed over.

""Reseda Rose"" - Ralph and Bill try to unravel a case involving secret military plans, a Russian submarine, and the kidnapping of Rhonda's mother.  Ralph's name ""officially"" is changed to Hanley.

""My Heroes have Always Been Cowboys"" - Ralph nearly kills a busload of people while chasing some crooks.  Ralph decides to put away the suit for good but then changes his mind after speaking to his own boyhood hero John Hart who played the Lone Ranger.  Great Episode!

""Fire Man"" - Tony is hired to repossess cars, and unknowingly takes a car filled with arson equipment. He gets pulled over, and blamed for setting fires. The real arsonist must be found in order to clear his name, and free him from jail.

""The Best Desk Scenario"" When Bill is passed over for a promotion, he decides to quit the FBI.  But Ralph needs his help to rescue Pam who has been kidnapped by the mob.

In addition to the 9 episodes the DVD set includes a pilot for the spinoff series Greatest American heroine shot a few years later where Ralph has to give up the suit and find someone to take his place.

This was the kind of fun, 80's show, much like the A-Team where there was a lot of action but no one ever really got killed or hurt.  A simpler show for simpler times.  Katt was perfectly cast as the nebbish, reluctant superhero and Culp was sardonicly well-fit for the role as the tough FBI agent.  An enjoyable throw back and great to see on DVD.",1108425600,6,3519,4.504731861198739
2194800,4,B0006SSP9O,"This series spoofed the many superhero sci-fi series which were popular during the late 1970's early 1980's (Wonder Woman, The Incredible Hulk).

Schoolteacher Ralph Hinkley (William Katt, whose other best known work was a part in `Carrie') receives a suit from aliens while on a field trip with his students.

Because he quickly looses the instruction manual, Ralph now has to things out on his own. The whole series revolves around Ralph trying to figure out how to save the world while also learning how the suit works.

Ralph is paired with FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) after the later convieniently experiences car trouble nearby the landing site. Ralph also has a girlfriend, Pam Davidson (Connie Selleca).

Joey Scarbury sings the theme song which became a runaway hit during the series run. The only really annoying thing was Hinkley's temporary name switch in the aftermath of the Reagan assasination attempt (end of this season), most people had understood this show did not endorse harming any president.

Notable episodes from this season are (obviously) the ""Pilot"" which explains how Ralph got his suit and basically sets up the entire series. ""The hit car"" has Ralph helping to transport a witness in a high-profile drug smuggling case which Agent Maxwell has finally cracked. I also like ""My heroes have always been cowboys"" because meeting a childhood hero ultimately helps Ralph deal with his (obvious) feelings of disillusionment after he had almost wiped out a busload of tourists with one of his many mishaps with the suit.

There are only eight episodes in this season (including the two hour pilot) but the DVD has extras. All-new interviews with the series stars Katt, Culp, and Selleca and series creator Stephen J.

However, I couldn't give it five stars because some of the songs originally used in the show have been changed, no doubt due to licensing issues. Of course they kept the main, ""Believe it or Not"" theme, but in the pilot episode they used ""Help Me Rhonda"" and ""Rocket Man"" both sung by Joey Scarbury, and both have been replaced with music with far less feeling and impact on this DVD set. I know it's expensive, but what a shame Stephen J. Cannell & Co. wouldn't spend the extra money to include those original songs!

That said, the remastering job is superb and it is wonderful to finally own the series in this format. It looks so much better this way than on my aged and and chopped up tapes from syndication.",1108425600,8,850,4.407643312101911

Then (of course), a Spaceship appears out of sky and aliens tell the pair that they have been chosen to save the world. Ralph is given a suit that gives him special powers. Unfortunately, he promptly loses the instruction book so he and Maxwell will have to learn the hard way what the suit is capable of.

How did this show ever make it to television?  Only in the 1980s would a story line this hokey not only air, but also do so well.  But the 1980s were great for cheesy fun sitcoms.  And GAH is no exception!  I pre-ordered the DVD as soon as I found out about it.  And it certainly didn't disappoint!  It is a great addition to my 1980s TV collection.

The DVD contains the first 8 episodes of the show (which make up the entire first season).  Also included are 75 minutes worth of cast interviews and a bonus pilot episode for a proposed but never aired spin-off called ""The Greatest American Heroine"".  It's easy to see why the spin-off never lasted, but still great to see the pilot included on the DVD.

One piece of trivia I recently learned: how the producers came up with Ralph's last name.  Originally, for the first 3 - 5 episodes, Ralph's name last name was Hinkley. Then in March of 1981, a man named John Hinkley tried to assassinate Ronald Regan.  Fearing bad publicity, the show's producers changed the character's name to Hanley for the last 3 episodes of season one. But later in Season 2 they change it back to Hinkley.

What I like most about the show is that whenever Ralph puts on the suit, he is not perfect when using the suit because he is still getting used to his new powers.  I remember my friends and I used to make fun of him because he always had trouble flying (and landing).

For die-hard fans of the show, the proposed spinoff pilot ""Greatest American Heroine"", is worth a look, but it's easy to see why it did not become a series.

The interview with series creator Stephen Cannell explains a lot about the series including how it was created and why it only lasted two and half years.

The book that shows what is on which DVD is in the form of the ""instructions book"" that Ralph lost in the pilot/first episode.

If you look in the first few minutes of ""Fire Man"", Danny Glover plays a police officer.",1108339200,4,1082,4.316831683168317
2194805,4,B0006SSP9O,"This series came out in 1981 when I was only six but it was everything I could remember it to be! Great job on the digital clean-up. Crisp sound quality. Breaks where you would expect commercials are not as good as other tv series dvds but it is almost unnoticable. The only thing that seems odd is in the pilot episode it seems that modern music was added to certain parts of the show. I know that sounds wierd but some of the music just doesn't fit for that time period. Still, I was happy to finally get this series!",1108166400,4,519,4.2

Nice colorful booklet made to look like the instruction manual. YES, the one lost by our bumbling hero! We already own all the episodes from original UNCUT airings minus the GAHeroine pilot. Love those original commercials :-) Still a worthy addition and cheap IMHO! Beautiful video and sound quality. Digital Stereo on 3 DVD DISCS. 4:3 Full frame format. Plays well and sounds great in our Home Theater. Can't wait to see this on our upcoming upgraded 100"" projection screen. Already pre-ordered season 2.

2194807,4,B0006SSP9O,"Yesterday was spent in blissful heaven as I watched my GAH DVDs and found them just as good as I remember them being.  I have occassionally been burned by childhood favorites, but this holds up awfully well.  Yes, the effects veer from poor to abysmal and Ralph's stuntman is at least twenty pounds heavier than Katt, but this show is even more pertinent than it was in the early 80's.  A liberal and a conservative, both of whom believe that they can make a difference in creating a better world, team up and do indeed make a difference.  Also, the soundtrack is fabulous.  Not just the highly memorable theme song, but also the extra song that plays in each episode at some point.  Plus, Bill is just even snarkier than I'd remembered.

Overall, this isn't great or classic television, but it's memorable and fun.  Easily worth the price for pure enjoyment levels.",1107993600,3,866,4.651315789473684
2194808,4,B0006SSP9O,"It's about time this show finally appeared in SOME format after all these years. The DVD transfer is excellent and completely belies the shows age. I'm sure it's 80% nostalgia, but the show is still a lot fun to watch. Anyone that was growing up in the early 80's will instantly recognize the show's unbearably catchy theme song. The show can be corny at times, and the effects are laughable by today's standards (they were pretty impressive for early 80's television). But the show has a lot of heart and the dynamics of the three main characters is interesting and evolves nicely over time.

William Katt is great as an everyman who suddenly finds himself the owner of a goofy-looking suit that gives him super powers and is often unwillingly responsible for saving the world from destruction. Robert Culp really shines as Bill Maxwell, the patriotic-to-a-fault FBI agent. Culp plays the character brilliantly straight which just makes it all the funnier when things don't work out quite right. And Connie Seleca is just as attractive as I remember, playing the lawyer, Pam Davidson. The show did a good job of not simply relegating her to being the ""superhero's girlfriend"" and there were many opportunities to showcase her talent (although it's a shame they didn't do more).

The DVD set includes 75 minutes of interviews with Stephen Cannell, William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Seleca and Michael Pare. There is a lot of interesting information here from all those involved, but it's definitely Robert Culp that conveys an appreciation for the show and points out aspects that might be missed by the casual viewer. It was clear he had a great affinity for and believed in both the character and the show.

The set also includes the unaired pilot of ""The Greatest American Heroine"" (not for the squeamish). However, it's a great inclusion given that the first season was so short. I guess it's up to the viewer whether they feel it's really a part of the GAH mythology.

Fortunately the set price reflects the fact that season 1 had so few episodes. One gripe I had was that they overused the theme song in the menus. By the time you navigate the menus to get to a show, you are already getting tired of the theme song... then you have to sit through the show's opening credits with... surprise... the theme song. I'm one of those people who happen to like the song anyway, but I could see it getting annoying to some people.

If you have the same fond memories of the show that I do, you won't be disappointed by this set!",1107907200,4,2526,4.693002257336343

The Greatest American Hero

Look at what's happened to me, I can't believe it myself. Suddenly I'm up on top of the world, It should've been somebody else.  Believe it or not, I'm walking on air. I never thought I could feel so free eee eee. Flying away on a wing and a prayer. Who could it be? Believe it or not it's just me.

The opening paragraph to this review is taken from one the greatest television theme songs of all time, ""The Greatest American Hero."" The song perfectly sets the tone and mood for what is one of the great unsung shows of all time.  GAH deftly weaved sly humor, satire and standard super hero drama into one unique package.

In this show Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) is a mild mannered school teacher who is stuck teaching a bunch of troubled students, on his second day in the classroom he decides to try and bond with his students by taking them out on a field trip to the desert, when the school bus break down he goes for a walk to seek help. He comes across FBI Agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) who is also having car trouble.  While arguing with each other a Spaceship appears out of sky, the aliens tell the two that they have been chosen to save the world.  Ralph is given a suit that gives him special powers, unfortunately he loses the instructions and he and Maxwell have to learn what the suit is capable of.

Everything about the pilot clicks right away, the chemistry between Bill and Ralph is spot on perfect, when you add Ralph's lawyer girlfriend Pam (Connie Sellecca) and the students headed up by Michael Pare, and Faye Grant the sparks start flying.  During the first season this weird cocktail made for fun character moments - like the classic handshake where Ralph accidentally breaks Bill's hand, or whenever Bill and Pam get into arguments about Bill's sexist views, all classic moments.

The other funny thing was how the producers couldn't decide what Ralph's last name was going to be, for the first 3 - 5 episodes his name last name was Hinkley, then for some unknown reason they changed it to Hanley for the last 3 episodes of season one.  But on ""The Greatest American Heroine"" pilot it's changed back to Hinkley.

Final Grade A

DVD FEATURES

I did not realize that the first season of the show was so short.  I was disappointed when I found out that there were only eight original season one episodes.  The good thing is, all of the season one episodes are terrific and appear to be uncut. The set includes the original two hour pilot and for snicks it also includes the one hr pilot for the proposed spin-off ""The Greatest American Heroine."" Let me just say, that pilot was HORRIBLE.  In many ways this is why TV Shows on DVD is a fantastic concept.  This is one of those shows that I had fond memories of and has not worn out its welcome through ""over syndication."" In fact I don't remember this show ever airing again after it's initial first several years of post television cancellation. I'm surprised a channel like Sci-Fi hasn't aired reruns.

The DVD set is real lean on extras, there are no episode specific commentary tracks, but there is about 75 minutes worth of new interviews with Stephen J. Cannell, William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, and Michael Pare each talking about 15 - 19 minutes about their experiences.  In a cute moment they had Connie interview Michael.  There seemed to be genuine like there. It was good to see that after 23 years they were still obviously good friends.  The cast has aged gracefully, Sellecca, Cannell, Culp and Pare all look pretty much the same, Katt looks tired.

The quality of the transfer was interesting. The first five episodes are clean, crisp and color corrected.  But episodes six - eight include some fuzziness and blemishes where things get out of focused and duo toned for a few seconds. While the pilot for ""Greatest American Heroine"" looks really bad.  The audio is in Dolby Digital Stereo, and is pretty sharp. I particularly like the menu screens, they include the theme song playing in the background, with nice full motion video.  The menu text fonts are clear and easily readable.  As for the packaging the case cover is beautiful, and instead of the annoying fold out disks, the set comes with two slip case disks that are easy to pull out and put away. This DVD gets extra points for taking the time and effort to include all the original music from the series. I adore the music in GAH, and it's nice that all of it is still intact.  You hear that Fox??????!! I won't go into my ""Roswell"" was butchered on DVD rant here.

DVD Extras Grade B

FINAL THOUGHTS

When they announced that this series was coming to television, I feared that it wouldn't hold up, that maybe my memory of the show was fuzzy. The one thing that was consistent was how that theme song has always stayed with me, for the last three months it's been stuck in my head and won't go away. It's hard to believe this series is 23 years old. Sometimes it doesn't pay to go back and relive your childhood (I still shudder and can't believe how much I loved Ultraman or Johnny Socko), not in this case, I was blown away and surprised by how well the special effects and stories hold up - the fashions are a little questionable, but it's not as bad as a lot of 70s television. ""The Greatest American Hero"" has aged gracefully. It is truly a classic and a must own DVD.

GREATEST AMERICAN HERO ORIGINAL THEME SONG LYRICS

Look at what's happened to me,

I can't believe it myself.

Suddenly I'm up on top of the world,

It should've been somebody else.

Believe it or not,

I'm walking on air.

I never thought I could feel so free eee eee.

Flying away on a wing and a prayer.

Who could it be?

Believe it or not it's just me.

It's like a light of a new day,

It came from out of the blue.

Breaking me out of the spell I was in,

Making all of my wishes come true ue ue.

Believe it or not,

I'm walking on air.

I never thought I could feel so free eee eee.

Flying away on a wing and a prayer.

Who could it be?

Believe it or not it's just me",1107043200,2,6083,4.408071748878924
2194810,4,B0006SSP9O,"I fondly remember this show from the early 1980s. I love superhero stuff, especially where an average guy gets superpowers. This show was sort of a take off on ""Green Lantern"" from DC comics. However, instead of a magic ring, schoolteacher, Ralph Hinckley (William Katt))(later changed abruptly and pointlessly to ""Hanley"" after Reagan was shot by John Hinckley), gets a supersuit from benevolent aliens that allows him to do all sorts of super stuff (fly, super strength, super speed, telekinesis, telepathy, invisibility, etc.). The aliens arrange for Ralph to be paired with an FBI agent, wonderfully played by a scene-chewing Robert Culp, to keep the world safe. Unfortunately, Ralph quickly loses the instruction book and mayhem ensues whenever he tries to use his powers. During the series, Ralph used his superpowers to fight mafia types, ghosts, nuclear war, spies, etc. The better episodes (I can't remember how many seasons this show lasted) involved learning some backstory to the aliens and the super suit. (In one episode, we learn that, much like the Green Lantern, other men had been given the suit in the past). I vaguely recall there was a feeble attempt to revive the series with Ralph handing the suit over to a woman, but it never went anywhere.

The upside to the series was a prime-time show with a superhero premise and fun acting. The downside was dismal, repetitive special effects (I would love to see someone redo this show today with the modern FX techniques available) and Ralph's annoying class of 30-year-old ""high school"" students.",1105833600,,1563,5.058139534883721
