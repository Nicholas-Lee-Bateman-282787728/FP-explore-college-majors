7389196,3,B014DMSJD0,"I just finished watching THE DIABOLICAL and am about to be the first review, which I really don't like. But, since there are no others, here goes: First, I noticed that this film had won an award at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas, where I happen to live. So, I went into the movie with very high expectations and that was MY problem with it from the beginning. There have been so many talented writers, directors, musicians, etc. from Austin that have ""made it"" in the show business arena that I was expecting to be blown away!
THE DIABOLICAL starts out strong, with solid actors that are skilled and a story that brings you into it immediately. Unfortunately, as the story starts to unfold, it gets very strange and continues to stay that way. At first, it seems to be a type of ghost or haunting tale, with the single mother trying to protect her two young children from extremely dreadful looking ""ghosts"" that would scare the hell out of anyone! These entities get stronger and more terrifying as the plot thickens. But, once the tale starts to reveal itself, is when it becomes entirely too inconceivable to be believed. With that said, it's still got some good spooky moments that will make you jump, but for me, I was left feeling disappointed, because I know it could've been much more frightening with some minor changes to the script.",1445126400,5,1353,4.618257261410788
7389197,1,B014DMSJD0,"This movie is boring and the ending is ridiculous.

I can save you some time.
This movie is not about a haunting.
It is a science fiction movie about teleporting from the future.

7389199,5,B014DMSJD0,"I have to preface my review with the fact that I waited to watch this for free streaming before I purchased. I then went in for the full HD buy, something I rarely do. This film deserves it. It is a genre film. If you don't like the genre, moveon.org. From the first immaculate long shot with delicious foley and soundscape work, and luscious visual first-person transfer of perspective, this film is a paranormal mystery. You will be surprised at the end if you keep spoilers at bay and just sink into this piece for exactly what it is. The craftsmanship is impeccable, the casting amazing, writing and plot strong start to finish. This is not a masterpiece of filmmaking, it is a masterpiece of its genre. It is the perfect embodiment of its genre, with a genuine, interesting conclusion, that builds up to, rather than abruptly jar with, its fascinating finish. In an effort to not give too much away or become an accursed spoiler myself, I leave my review at this.",1461456000,3,968,4.601156069364162
7389200,3,B014DMSJD0,I thought this would be better then it actually turned out.  It starts off as looking like a paranormal movie but halfway through we realise that science is to blame for this threat to a mother and her young family.  I think I did more or less work it all out by the end but there are still a few things unclear.  It's one of those films you need to watch several times to really understand but most people would not bother nor have the patience to do that.  The conclusion (if that's what it was) came a little too late and there will not be enough interest for a follow up movie.  All in all it left me rather cold.  Disappointing!,1459814400,,633,4.147540983606557

7389206,5,B014DMSJD0,"I thought this movie was great and was easy to understand why certain things were happening.  I don't know why some people found it hard to figure out, because the end of the movie showed exactly why it was happening and to whom it was happening. I don't want to say too much more without giving it away.
I thought the creatures or monsters, whatever you feel like calling them, were awesome and quite scarey and you will find out why they were there in the first place.
I encourage anyone that wants to watch this to really concentrate on exactly what each person is saying and doing so you don't miss the involvement of certain persons.
Overall, a great movie!",1455580800,,662,4.471074380165289
7389207,2,B014DMSJD0,I could not even finish the movie.  The story was slow and really made no sense. I doozed off and then started to think about how I would never get the minutes of my life back that I spent watching this movie.  I would only watch this if it was free and I suffered from insomnia,1455494400,,278,3.9464285714285716
7389208,1,B014DMSJD0,"I had to force myself to finish this movie. The writing and surprising of Ali Larter the acting was so fake and contrived. Every character over did but without doing anything.. I am glad it was free on NF. I would be calling amazon back for my money if I had to pay to rent this movie. Its like the director and writer wanted us to identify with the family so they made it seem like the whole movie was in slow motion. One giant slow moving boring dream, that ultimately ends with a time paradox. Did i mention how horrible every actor was in this movie. Every single person who spoke a line in this movie should give up acting. BLAH...",1455408000,,636,4.221311475409836
7389209,1,B014DMSJD0,"I rarely leave one-star reviews but this was beyond terrible. It starts out with no build-up whatsover, just 'bam' into the nightmare this family is living, and apparently has been living for many years. I know it's a B movie (more life an F), but no mother would allow her children to stay in a house like that for more than a night, let alone years. Instead, they try to find out the 'why' rather than just get out.
There are no explanations, just cheesy attempts at 'jump' scenes that fall flat. When they FINALLY decide to attempt an explanation for the paranormal experiences, they make no sense and don't fit the film at all. Don't waste your time, no matter how much you like B horror flicks - and I love them - this is beyond redemption.",1455408000,,745,4.405797101449275
7389210,4,B014DMSJD0,"I personally found this movie, a breath of fresh air, among all the smog of the horror movies released these days. It was fresh and original and unique. It wasn't afraid to take chances and delivered on the scares and creepy feelings expected to be in haunted house movies, but it did it in a unique and original way that not only worked, but was intriguing as well. A lot of people have said that the movie left too many unanswered questions and that it needed a ""prequel"" to explain some things; however, I don't think those people payed close enough attention to what they probably assumed was ""unnecessary dialogue"" throughout the film. Infact, I thought the film makers did a good job setting up the story and answering questions. I'm a movie buff and story writer, though, so I pay close attention to those kinds of details. Overall, this movie this movie won't disappoint you. If you are looking for a descent haunted house movie with a unique and different twist, then this is a good movie to take a chance on.",1454976000,2,1018,4.5683060109289615

Yeah, there are low budgets and those are bound to be not that great, but this with its so called ~artsy sci-fi flair~ it tries for is just an insult.  The timelines make NO SENSE. Nothing gets really explained at all. Certain conclusions are just randomly found. I've never wanted to find a director and film maker and punch him for how s***ty a movie is till I saw this. The actors are fine. It's not their fault because they did a decent job. It's completely the plot, the way it was shot, and just about everything else.

7389220,3,B014DMSJD0,"I rented this on the basis that it was a ""horror"". If it had been classified as Sci-Fi which it is, I would have got more out of it. I don't see the plot holes and problems that other reviewers have mentioned, but I do see the anomalies by a cross genre  mis-labelling. As a horror it is 3 or less. As a Sci-Fi, it works fine. I guess I had more expectations, or different expectations from the Horror genre. Glad to see that most of the reviewers here tend to go in that direction. It should have a big label saying it is  Sci-Fi. As a Horror, I got more scares from NON-STOP. Actually, until the reveal point, the film does work as a scarey film, but then it takes a huge nose-dive when the Sci-Fi motif becomes fully apparent.",1451260800,,729,4.163120567375887

Madison (Ali Larter) a single mother and her children are awoken nightly by an increasingly strange and intense presence. She gets help from her scientist boyfriend Nikolai, together begin a hunt to destroy the violent spirit that paranormal experts are too frightened to take on.

This is certainly one of the better Straight to DVD horror releases in a while, a decent budget movie with a great story that's gets stuck straight into the creepiness right from the beginning after the cool open credit sequence, this movie is plenty scary, it may borrow a few ideas from other movies but it holds its own with some inventive effects and hellraiser style nightmarish sequences, it has some bloody moments as well, all the effects look of a great budget, the movie near the end as it unfolds goes in a different direction, an interesting type of twist I suppose for this type of movie, the cast is all good, Ali Larter is a beautiful and talented lead and is no stranger to horror movies (Final destination, Final destination 2, House on haunted hill, Resident evil) the soundtrack score is creepy, its a great little horror that's worth seeking out.

7389231,3,B014DMSJD0,"Madison Heller (Ali Larter) is a single mom with financial problems. She has two children, Jacob (Max Rose) and Haley (Chloe Perrin). Jacob has anger management issues and the house they live in has visitors. Haley believes the man in her closet is her father. Paranormal investigators run from the house. She wants to leave the house, the bank has made her a nice offer, but her kids become ill when they go outside.

The visitors look from all white to something missing its skin and crawling on the floor like something from ""Hellraiser."" They have determined there are three distinct visitors. Mom's boyfriend and the kid's tutor (Arjun Gupta) agrees to help out.

What made the film interesting is that it starts out as a supernatural horror and ends up with a nice twist. It was an okay film and would make for a decent rental.

7389232,2,B014DMSJD0,"When the film opens single mom Madison (Ali Larter) and her young son and daughter are trapped in a house so haunted paranormal investigators run screaming from it, but they can't move--first for financial reasons, then for (apparently) paranormal ones involving the health of the children.  The Diabolical has a decent enough starting off point and some interesting special effects, but it generates virtually no suspense and becomes fairly monotonous by thirty minutes in.  From that point on the movie lumbers on dutifully and dully until a third act plot twist that ends up taking the movie into a different genre altogether.

I suppose you could possibly give first time co-writer/director Alistair Legrand some points for ambition, but execution is another matter altogether.  His special effects are frequently more interesting in concept than effective and it all feels like a movie that didn't know what it wanted to be--is The Diabolical a mediocre horror film or incoherent science fiction?  Is the end meant to be ambiguous or just accidentally confusing?

The Diabolical is a mess that isn't completely uninteresting but the handful of moments that actually work don't come close to making up for the bad pacing, repetitive shock effects and sloppy writing that relies way too heavily on hard to swallow coincidences.  Then there's the complete shift in genre towards the end that wasn't set-up sufficiently beforehand to actually work, making it feel very much like The Diabolical started off as a haunted house movie and the filmmakers changed their minds at some point during the shoot.  This one simply doesn't work.",1446249600,,1633,5.182509505703422

7389234,4,B014DMSJD0,"The movie simply needs a prequel or a sequel. Something more to answer all the unanswered questions which leave a giant hole in the plot. As almost every review has said it started out right from the first scenes as a great horror film. It had all of the right elements to bring you to that high. Then it did seem as though it started a mix of sci-fi which was a great blend. The ending just fell flat without information which led to the whole thing. We are left with so many questions that need to be answered. But how? How to make that ending into a prequel or sequel which has the same scary, freaky kick Perhaps the fight to keep her. A war between science which goes too far and love that has to go farther..

7389238,2,B014DMSJD0,"Here is a movie that seemed to have some real momentum behind it. Horror buffs ready to unite in sheer glee that a film with some real teeth was finally delivered to the market. The film's promise was further supported in many of the major online reviews. ""Immediate driving action"" they said ""Twists and turns like a roller coaster"" another reviewer barked. But, the review that topped them all said ""An ending so creative and unexpected...you never see it coming!""
Well, I didn't need much more encouraging especially considering the exceptionally tight trailer that was cut and lastly...but certainly in no way least, the cast is lead by the beautiful and talented, Ali Larter.
In the famous words of Martha Stewart: ""What could possibly go wrong""...Right?
WRONG!! Let me just get the good stuff out of the way first. Not to worry Ali Larter fans...she gives this role and this film everything she's got and more. As always...she's an absolute pleasure to watch. That said, The Diabolical also lives up to it's hype and sucks you in from the very opening scenes. It doesn't let go either! It continues to deliver all of the creative twists and turns and keeps you guessing as the action builds and the plot strategically moves forward. Here's the clincher though...the film does such a good job entertaining and distracting you from tracking the running time (as any good filmmaker would hope to achieve). So you really feel you've reached the mid-point of the film as the crazy, unexpected plot and hair raising action reach their crescendo, and you are just starting to guess at where this hugely hyped ending might take you...and your excitement for this first rate horror film actually delivering something special is at it's absolute HEIGHT! The film ends and the credits start to role.
WHAT??? I'm not kidding here...it's the craziest thing I have ever seen. It's like they just ran out of money and stopped filming directly in the middle and slapped the credits on so they could take what they finished to market and recoup their losses. This movie seriously had phenomenal potential. They were leading us to an ending that looked like it was going to deliver something exceptionally creative and they just flat out cut it off without an ending. Some of you may just want to check this out to experience the sheer novelty of a film being ended in the middle. Perhaps this is the filmmakers idea of creating a hard stop for a sequel Whatever the case...it's got to be one of the more frustrating experiences I've ever had!.",1445558400,4,2532,4.809633027522936

(The following paragraph includes some mild spoilers.)
About halfway through the story the film suddenly transforms into a sort of sci-fi thriller, trying to explain how and why these entities have to appear specifically in Madisons house.

The basic idea has potential for unique, genre-bending thriller, but sadly The Diabolical is simply not that. Some may turn a blind eye to the films obvious logical inconsistencies, but even so, The Diabolical has another and bigger problem. That is, the film is dull and boring.

Director Alistair Legrand (nephew of Oscar-winning composer Michel Legrand) knows what he is doing and the cast including Ali Larter are doing their best, but The Diabolical is plodding, lacking the finesse of a skilled storyteller.
