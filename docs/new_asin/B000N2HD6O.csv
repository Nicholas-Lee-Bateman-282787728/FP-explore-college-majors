2752981,5,B000N2HD6O,"Bought the 4th season the day it came out on 5-15. There is a cool bonus episode from season 5 as a bonus with Tom Selleck as detective Lance White called ""White on White nearly perfect."" Great guest appearances including Larry Hagaman (JR Ewing) and Rita Moreno.",1179964800,4,263,4.617021276595745
2752982,5,B000N2HD6O,"Folks, I'd ignore Jabbers review, clearly he doesn't open his eyes when saying ""Does he ever change his coat"", do compare the box set artwork of seasons 3 & 4 and you'll find they differ. He also contradicts himself on the Brady Bunch complete series stating ""Bad family values"" whilst he gave Family Guy four stars, I love Family Guy, it's an excellent show, but that has bad family values -- that's what makes it funny.

In my opinion the Rockford Files is one of the best PI series ever, join Jim in season four for some more outstanding acting and cases. If you purchase this you won't be disappointed.",1178582400,6,606,4.509090909090909
2752983,5,B000N2HD6O,"Anyone who followed the antics and precarious situation ole Rockford get's himself into can not help but enjoy this special, special classic TV Series. Watch out Star Trek, Rockford Files may become the new cult classic.",1174348800,4,220,5.138888888888889
2752984,5,B000N2HD6O,"the 70's get a bad rap. they brought us disco and sideburns but also spawned great movies & television. sanford & son, archie bunker, happy days, the jeffersons and, yes, the Rockford Files.

Man I loved this show. Garner is a guy's guy, no blown dry hair like CHIPS or Magnum PI. Just a tough guy doing his job as a PI. The slew of great characters (Angel sticks out) are a precursor the Law & Order franchise. And who could forget the cheesy theme song.",1174003200,23,455,4.290697674418604
2752985,5,B000N2HD6O,"Hard to digest the fact that this is coming out so close to the release of Season 3 (which I just reviewed!) Anyway, I have seen some of these eps on my local TV and the dvd set isn't out yet but I suspect the quality will be as top notch as the previous seasons. What I wanted to weigh in on is the brillance behind the show. How they continuously and yet CREDIBLY (very important) got Jim Rockford into trouble each week is nothing short of amazing... and when I hear Angel Martins quivering voice, no matter what is being said I HAVE to laugh. BRILLIANT! Throw in Becker and Joseph Rockford and you've got a bonafide hit... and of course I saved the ""Beth"" for last:) Gretchen Corbett my heart is still yours after all these years:)~

TV will never be better than the Rockford Files, and I have to commend Universal on releasing these seasons so quickly, with BEAUTIFUL artwork, and on single sided non-freezing discs... now can you redo the A-Team with similar quality control?? Charging people for discs that play 2 out of 6 episodes should be a crime even Beth couldn't bail you out of. Now, release Season 5 next month:)",1173225600,22,1127,4.444444444444445
2752986,5,B000N2HD6O,"James Garner's laconic charm as Jim Rockford kept us coming back week after week and finally won him an Emmy in 1977. Garner, who would have been a star in any era, and sometimes seemed as if he would have fit more into films of the 1940's, finally found the perfect role on television as Jim Rockford. He was an ex-con given a full pardon when it was discovered he was innocent after all. Working as a P.I. and parking his gold Firebird in front of his trailor on the L.A. beach, Rockford could never quite shake the ex-con tag, nor could he shake his old cellmate, Evelyn ""Angel"" Martin.

Stuart Margolin was simply fantastic as the scheming Angel, always with an angle, and always certain to get Rockford into trouble when it backfired. Like Rockford, you just couldn't stay mad at Angel, no matter what con had blown up in his face or how much trouble he would get our favorite TV detective in from time to time. Rockford and Angel remained friends because of that unspoken bond all ex-cons have, and because deep down, Angel was a stand-up guy, though you couldn't always tell it from looking at the surface.

Noah Beery Jr. portrayed Rockford's lovable dad, Rocky. Rocky was a retired trucker who loved to fish, and passed on the hobby to Jim. It was the little moments like fishing that were really the heart and soul of this show when you stop to think about it. There were always a few slice-of-life moments mingled in with the great car chases, glorious con games, and other assorted mischief, as Rockford tried to solve a closed case and stay out of jail at the same time. Some weeks he was just trying to stay alive. Rocky would always give Jim that ""look"" if he had to come post bail.

Joe Santos was Rockford's often exasperated police pal, Dennis Becker. He was the buffer between Rockford and Becker's superiors, who hated Rockford and wanted any excuse to pull his P.I. license. Becker was a pal, but could only do so much for Jim as he had to stay out of hot water himself. He had a wife and kids to support, and for some strange reason, that sometimes took priority over helping Rockford out of a complicated jam.

Last, but by no means least, was Gretchen Corbett as lawyer Beth Davenport. The relationship between she and Rockford was complicated. They both had a deep affection for each other, which was sometimes complicated by the attorney-client relationship. Her efforts to keep Jim out of trouble with the cops took up a lot of her time. There was a romance of sorts between the two, but it never matured into something that would lead to marriage.

There were always solid guest stars, but it was Garner and his weekly regulars which made the show what it was. Stephen J. Cannell and Roy Huggins created this wonderful series and Juanita Bartlett wrote some of the finest scripts ever done for television. James Garner was absolutely perfect as Jim Rockford, and it has become difficult as the years have passed to separate the two in our minds.

Garner was, and is, a great actor and screen presence who made everything look easy. This was a terrific show and one of the best ever to be beamed into our homes once a week. Everyone loved ""The Rockford Files"" and couldn't wait to hear Mike Post's great theme music each week. It was recorded and turned into a huge radio hit and launched his career.

For a fourth season, we will get to listen to all those crazy messages left on Jim Rockford's answering machine. Fans never missed the opening of the show because a smile or a good laugh might be missed. You don't want to miss it either.

""This is Jim Rockford. At the tone, leave your name and message and I'll get back to you.""",1173052800,65,3658,4.506787330316742

He IS Rockford, just as he was Maverick and Cash McCall, etc. It's actually fun to watch how television shows used to be with the bad suits and the women's big hair and perfect makeup after car chases, etc. Not much has changed, come to think of it.

It's REALLY noticeable that more than 1 person subtitled the show, and 1 of them did a seriously poor job on all of the episodes he/she did. The extra stuff, while not a whole lot of it, was all subtitled nicely, and I especially enjoyed the Top 10 Sleuths show. I'd enjoy seeing more of that!

2753049,5,B000N2HD6O,"This show is about crime, and people in distress, etc., all of the same material covered by today's crime dramas.  However, too many of today's U.S.-produced crime dramas (I exclude the many fine British crime dramas being broadcast by public television) focus on graphic depictions low-life people dedicated to violence, drugs, sex, etc.  The values of too many of the people who live in the world of entertainment are a disgrace to themselves and others, and far too often the movies and television shows that they produce are saturated with their own low-life ways of living.  Rockford is a welcome respite from the trash now on television, and the chance to watch them without advertising is so wonderful, that I will keep buying the seasons of Rockford until all of them are gone.",1390521600,,785,4.887218045112782

2753063,5,B000N2HD6O,"James Garner returns as Malibu based private investigator James Rockford for the fourth season of The Rockford Files (1977-78).  Under the direction of Juanita Bartlett, the writing team for the series had their stuff together, delivering a season full of wonderfully written and immensely entertaining stories, that would earn The Rockford Files an Emmy, as the most Outstanding Drama.  There really isn't a loser among the 22 episodes, as Jim Rockford is operating at top form, getting involved in some compelling and intriguing adventures, while finding a good measure of success.

James Garner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maverick/dp/B007AAF3FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maverick</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marlowe/dp/B004ZRFQCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marlowe</a>) was simply brilliant as Rockford, a savvy but down to earth operator, who also cared about people.  While Garner was clearly the star, the outstanding and colorful group of supporting characters, were also huge contributors to the series' appeal.  Noah Berry Jr., Joe Santos, Stuart Margolin, and Gretchen Corbett, are all fantastic, although sadly this would be the last season to feature Corbett as Beth Davenport.  Even lieutenants Chapman (James Luisi) and Diehl (Tom Atkins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Creeps/dp/B002KPUN0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Creeps</a>), cops who clearly weren't Rockford fans, are still entertaining characters.

A talented group of guest stars, helps make the stories come alive.  These include James Whitmore Jr., John Pleshette, Susan Strasberg, George Loros, Priscilla Barnes, Claudette Nevins, Anthony Zerbe, Larry Hagman, Malachi Throne, and Vince Bagetta.  Rita Moreno won an Emmy, for her performance as Rita Capkovic in ""The Paper Palace"", while Valerie Curtin gives an equally worthy performance, as a dippy hippie chick in way over her head, in ""Quickie Nivana"".

Larry Linville is wonderfully irritating, as a behavioral researcher in ""A Deadly Maze"".  Joanne Nail is the classic girl in distress, in ""The Dog and Pony Show.  In a familiar tale, Chuck McCann plays a comedian who takes Rockford for a ride, in ""Requiem for a Funny Box"".  Jim has his mind twisted into a knot, while in pursuit of Nazi loot, in ""Irving the Explainer"".

Among Rockford's most bizarre adventures is ""South By Southeast"", where Jimbo winds up in a Latin American country, helping a woman (Dorrie Kavanaugh) in jeopardy.  In ""The Competitive Edge"", Rockford investigates a health club, and then finds himself trapped in an insane asylum.  Isaac Hayes returns as Gandolph Fitch in ""Second Chance"", where Jim's former cellmate, is involved with a singer (Dionne Warwick).

In ""The Queen of Peru"", while trying to recover a stolen diamond, Rockford crosses paths with a family from Indiana on vacation.  Jim's father Rocky, is involved with an old mob boss (Ken Lynch), and a retired FBI man (Victory Jory) in ""The Attractive Nuisance"".  ""The House on Willis Avenue"", introduces private eye Ritchie Brockelman (Dennis Dugan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling/dp/B00BNAE2AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling</a>), who teams with Jim, in investigating the death of a fellow private detective, as the obnoxious Vern St. Cloud (Simon Oakland) also snoops around.

Created by Roy Huggins and Stephen J. Cannell, The Rockford Files took the clich heavy private detective genre, down a completely new road.  With Rockford shedding his lovable loser image, the Emmy award winning fourth season is one of the best in the series, with more of the quirky adventures that the Malibu native specializes in.  This set is pretty much essential for any fan of the series, unfortunately like many programs from the 70's, image quality sometimes suffers, and James Garner's lack of involvement in any of the Rockford DVD releases is a real disappointment.",1372464000,2,4051,6.033158813263525

There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion).

Co-star his Pontiac Firebird Classic Sports Car, {The Rockfordmobile}, that out-ran all the baddies. His Texas characters, printing press, and routines are classics! Began as a spin-off from Jack Webb's Adam-12, laid the groundwork for the series, with Jim in trouble with the law. (Jim, Jimbo, Jimmy) almost NEVER got paid!

2753083,4,B000N2HD6O,"You can't go wrong with Jim Rockford. Season four is another great installment that has all 21 episodes. Unfortunately, it's the last season that has Beth Davenport (Gretchen Corbett). The remaining cast is excellent: Rocky (Noah Beery, Jr.), Dennis Becker (Joe Santos) & the slimeball Angel (Stuart Margolin).

The set opens with ""Beamer's Last Case"" that guest stars James Whitmore, Jr. (Beamer). Beamer is just a mechanic's gopher who steals Rockford's identity.
""Second Chance"" brings back Gandolph ""Gandy"" Fitch (Isaac Hayes). Gandy has fallen in love with a singer, Theda Best (Dionne Warwick) who has a shady past & a shady husband who's just been released from prison.
""The Dog & Pony Show"" has Jim helping a former mental patient.
""Irving the Explainer"" is one of the most unique episodes of The Rockford Files. It's directed by James Coburn who elicits some unusual nuances in the Rockford character. This episode is a matter of taste to many Rockford fans.
""The Mayor's Committee From Deer Lick Falls"" is directed by Ivan Dixon (Hogan's Heroes). Jim gets involved with four businessmen who wish to commission him in murdering Lauren Ingeborg (Priscilla Barnes of Three's Company's latter days).
""Hotel of Fear"" features Angel who has witnessed a murder by a hit man. It's hilarious watching him putting Lt. Chapman (James Luisi) through the hoops.
""Forced Retirement"" has Larry Hagman as guest star. Jim is hired to investigate the Minerva Project by Beth.
""The Attractive Nuisance"" finds Rocky opening a restaurant with a friend who has an unknown shady past.
""The Gang at Don's Drive-In"" guest stars Anthony Zerbe as an old friend of Jim's who will do anything to write another best seller. The running gag of the episode is no one seems to have read past chapter four of ""Free Fall to Ecstasy"".
""The Paper Palace"" has Rita Moreno guest starring as a prostitute who's being stalked.
""Dwarf in a Helium Hat"" finds Jim getting involved in a case after he receives a death threat by phone, the thing is it's not Jim being threatened, the caller has called the wrong number. Rick Springfield has a featured role in the episode.
""South by Southeast"" has Jim misidentified by the F.B.I. & sent to Mexico to handle a delicate situation.
""The House on Willis Avenue"" is a two part episode that features the P.I., Richie Brockleman (Dennis Dugan), who would later be the star of a short lived series starring the same character. Guest stars include Jackie Cooper, Howard Hesseman (WKRP in Cincinnati) & Simon Oakland.

There's a bonus episode from Season five but is that really a bonus? There's also a featurette that names the 10 greatest American detectives from film & television according to an online fan vote. It's nothing more than an advertisement for another cable channel.

One other thing: The subtitles are not completely accurate, there are many instances where the captioning doesn't match the dialog, sometimes with significant differences.",1230249600,24,2960,5.024439918533605

2753085,3,B000N2HD6O,"I don't want to rain on anyone's parade by giving the series only 3 stars.  I can see why people like it so much.  My interest was to see early work of David Chase, creator of the immortal series The Sopranos.  Chase produced and wrote several of the Season 4 episodes. Who knew such genius lurked behind this hokey series.

My favorite episode is the one involving the hippie chick who follows various New Age gurus.  At one point Rockford delivers a stirring lecture about having your own thoughts instead of blindly following opinion makers. It's certainly relevant for today.

My enjoyment was hindered by annoyances.  Annoying characters:  the dad and Angel. I cringed at the mere sight of Angel. He's just not funny, although I can see why people would think he's hilarious.  In matters of taste there is no dispute.

The cloying, irritating, grandiose musical score.

The ridiculous concept.  Rockford lives in a dilapidated trailer that is about to fall apart.  The outside is filthy.  The paint has worn away. Yet, he is allowed to park the trailer in the lot of a trendy beachfront bar & grill in a neighborhood that's described as upscale. No patrons or neighbors complained?

The trailer is the source of all sorts of nuisance activity (hoodlums stalking Rockford, shootouts and so on).  In one episode a guy jumps off the roof of the trailer, drawing paramedics, cops, and ambulance chasers.  And yet Rockford's still welcome.

At one point we learn that Rockford still owes money on the eyesore.  He's had to refinance it.  It's not even worth what it could fetch for salvage!  The restaurant probably doesn't charge rent, so what's the problem?

The gold Firebird:  The car is involved in all kinds of fender-benders and smashups yet it's always in pristine condition.

You see Rockford, an old man, sprinting after and tackling guys half his age.

You can accept these shortcomings if you're a fan of the show. They could be what make it so entertaining. If you think about it, that dopey trailer is kind of funny.

Rockford is perfect for late-night television when every channel has an infomercial, something to get you through a bout of insomnia. I watched two or three of the disks and decided to end the nice little nostalgia tour.

Being that David Chase worked on Rockford, the episodes are a worthwhile artifact of television history.",1217376000,4,2358,4.815461346633416
2753086,5,B000N2HD6O,"Love them, watched them as a kid on tv. Coffee was 10 cents a cup in one episode and Jim asked for 3 dollars in gas at the gas station in another. Those were the days !!",1204934400,2,169,3.5945945945945947
2753087,5,B000N2HD6O,I still enjoy this series after all these years.  What makes it better is my cousin Terry Leonard has a couple of uncredited roles and did some stunt work for this series.,1195603200,2,171,4.34375
2753088,4,B000N2HD6O,"This 1977-78 Season was a wonderful season of the ROCKFORD FILES along with the fact that the 4th Season of this detective drama was probably the 2nd best season of the ROCKFORD FILES as well, since it was the last season with my favorite character which was the down-on-his-luck private dick Jim Rockford(James Garner) foxy attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett)and Becker's skeptical superior officer Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins) along with the fact that Beth made the episodes of Rockford more interesting.

Unfortunately Gretchen Corbett abruptly quit the show in the Winter of 1978 due to a salary dispute Corbett had over her contract with Universal leaving us mourning the loss of Beth on this private detective drama which was such a shame on her abrupt departure in the second half of Rockford's Fourth Season in January of 1978 leaving no Beth in the last 2 seasons, which made it less interesting and less dramatic since Rockford didn't have Beth defending him anymore to be a buffer between him and Becker's hard-nosed superior officer Lt. Doug Chapman(James Luisi)a.k.a. ""Chappy"" whenever Rockford got arrested and/or in hot water in the Fifth and Sixth Seasons along with the fact that the last 2 seasons didn't have that chemisty kind of client/attorney relationship along with Becker's fondness and support towards Beth as well along with the fact that Beth was my favorite character on this show and always seemed to have a way of making people pay more attention and listen to her whenever Rockford was in trouble or arrested, even with Becker's overzealous superior officers(Lt. Chapman and Lt. Diehl), which obviously despised Rockford very much & constantly kept looking for excuses to bust Rockford & to get his P.I. license cancelled yet Beth still seemed to always manage finding a way to make Chapman & Diehl listen to her even though Rockford's frequent help from his often frustrated cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD often put Becker on a back-burner with Diehl and Chapman.

Unfortunately, when Beth abruptly departed the show, especially in the Fifth Season, Chappy didn't seem to pay much attention to Rockford's reasons or logics whenever Rockford was arrested and/or in hot water, since Rockford didn't have Beth to back him up anymore, which really sucked and was a tad similar to how it was when Amy Allen(Melinda Culea)was abruptly dropped from THE A-TEAM in the second half of the A-TEAM's 2nd Season when Culea was fired for being too tomboyish.

I also noticed Rockford's 4th Season was that both the inclusive Beth and Rockford's sleazy manipulative ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stu Margolin) seemed to have started coming out less and less often in the 4th Season and that Chapman didn't seem to come out much in this season either and that Chappy started coming out quite a bit more often in the following season(1978-79 Season)with Beth gone even though Angel continued to appear in lesser episodes in the remaining 2 seasons of this private detective show as well.

Therefore, Beth and Angel came out a lot more often in the first 3 seasons of this show than they did in the last 3 seasons of Rockford along with the fact that Beth was no longer on the show anymore and made her last appearance in ""The Attractive Nuisance"" episode, since Beth supposedly moved away and started a law office of her own in the second half of Rockford's Fourth Season when she had given Rockford and Angel the news in the ""Forced Retirement"" episode that she was resigning from the Hartcourt & Lowe firm in L.A.

Now that the ROCKFORD FILES Fourth Season and Fifth Season are on DVD, I hope to see Rockford's Sixth Season released on DVD by the end of this year(2008)along with the fact that the ROCKFORD FILES-Season 6 would be a great X-Mas gift for this year if it were released by late November and early December of 2008.

I also thought it was interesting seeing guest stars like
*Singers Dionne Warwick & the late great Isaac Hayes in the ""Second Chance"" episode

*Gerald McRaney in the ""Hotel Fear"" episode before his co-starring days as the short-tempered gonzo private-detective(Rick Simon) on SIMON & SIMON and before his co-starring days on MAJOR DAD, TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL, & PROMISED LAND.

*Larry Hagman in the ""Forced Retirement"" episode after his co-starring days as Major Nelson on I DREAM OF JEANNIE days and before his co-starring days as the salty J.R. Ewing on DALLAS.

*Singer Rick Springfield in the ""Dwarf In A Helium Hat"" episode before his teen idol days as a musician before he got famous from his song ""Jessie's Girl"".

*Larry Linville in the ""Deadly Maze"" episode during his co-starring days on M.A.S.H.

*George Wyner in the ""Queen Of Peru"" episode before his co-starring days on the detective drama MATT HOUSTON and on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES.

*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Beamer's Last Case"" episode way before his co-starring days as Hunter and McCall's incompetent fellow officer(Det. Bernie Terwiller) on the police drama HUNTER.

*Lance LeGault in the ""A Deadly Maze"" episode before his co-starring days as the bitter Army nemesis(Col. Decker)on THE A-TEAM and before his co-starring days as Magnum's skeptical Naval nemesis(Col. Buck Green) on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Dennis Fimple in ""The Prisoner Of Rosemont Hall"" episode before his co-starring days on MATT HOUSTON.

*Quinn Redekker in the ""Quickie Nirvana"" episode before his co-starring days as Rex Sterling on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Oscar nominee(Rita Moreno) in ""The Paper Palace"" episode

*Bill Boyett in ""The Competitive Edge"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12

*Meredith Mac Rae in the ""Requiem Of A Funny Box"" episode after her co-starring days as Billy Jo Bradley on both PETTICOAT JUNCTION & THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES

*Mills Watson in the ""Gang At Don's Drive-In"" episode before his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO

In addition to why this 1977-78 Season DVD of Rockford was so cool, I thought it was cool how the ROCKFORD FILES-Season 4 DVD provided a bonus episode from Rockford's 5th Season by adding the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode on it, which was from the 1978-79 Season of Rockford on NBC, which by the way was one of my favorite episodes of Rockford along with the fact that the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode was almost like a preminition of Tom Selleck's days on the detective drama MAGNUM, P.I.

Therefore, I would also have to say that Rockford's Fourth Season was definitely one of my favorite season throughout the ROCKFORD FILES whole 6-year run on NBC.

The one thing I don't understand is on the bonus features on this DVD when the producers and critics of the ROCKFORD FILES were all talking about this show and looking back on it during the days when the ROCKFORD FILES was a big hit TV show in the 1970's, they had exaggerrated when they had explained that Rockford was the one private investigator that just could not fight, since he used to get beat up a lot, but that I know that was not true, because the only time Rockford would get beat up was when there were 2 or more people ganging up on Rockford, but Rockford would usually beat up the goones that jumped him if Rockford was fighting them in a fair fight, especially when Rockford fought his opponents one-on-one or one at a time.

Therefore, the truth of the matter is even though Rockford would get beat up quite a bit throughout the ROCKFORD FILES whole 6-year run on NBC, Rockford would kick a lot of ass too and was not too bad of a fighter either, but this show kind of reminded me of the detective show MANNIX, since it was quite similar to the ROCKFORD FILES along with the fact that  Mannix(Michael Connors) used to get beat up a lot too along with the fact that MANNIX took place in the L.A. Area on top of that.

Something else I noticed about this 1977-1978 Season was Rockford's Firebird wasn't quite the same Firebird he used in the first 3 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES, because I noticed that in the last 3 seasons of this show that the grill on Rockford's gold Firebird was different and more slanted than the grill was from Season 1-3, even though Rockfords Firebird was supposedly the same car throughout the ROCKFORD FILES whole 1974-80 run on NBC.

This was also probably one of Rockford's better years since this was the season before James Garner's health problems and newer more popular shows like the DUKES OF HAZZARD had led to the ROCKFORD FILES cancellation on NBC with its last episode ""Deadlock In Parma"" on Thursday January 10, 1980, but this show still inspired the premiere of newer detective shows in the 80's like MAGNUM, PI which debuted on CBS in December of 1980 and SIMON & SIMON which debuted on CBS in November of 1981.

It was also a lot better & nicer to watch these episodes of Rockford complete & uncut like they were originally shown on their original air-dates on NBC unlike they were shown in reruns on A&E, TNN, TV Land, WGN, and ME-TV since they edited each episode with too many deleted scenes to allot more time for more commercial interruptions.

So now that Universal has released just about all 6 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES out on DVD, we can now look forward to the private detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 being releasing on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and the detective drama SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 being released on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 which gives us 2 new classic private detective dramas to look forward to for the Spring of 2010.",1195430400,6,9533,4.803418803418803

I have bought all four seasons and intend to buy all the rest as they are released.
If you are not that familiar with this off-beat detective who lives in a trailer on a California beach, watch a few episodes and you will be hooked on this show.",1188691200,5,459,3.946236559139785
2753092,5,B000N2HD6O,"What a joy it is to watch the season 4 episodes of The Rockford Files again! As with all Rockfod Files episodes, each show features a variety
of talented actors, interesting (although seemingly improbable) plots, a fun car chase or two, and a cadre of interesting characters. With all of the stupid and insipid ""realty shows"" on TV, it is refreshing to see an ""unreality show"" that offers us entertainment, action, and ""tongue-in-cheek"" wit. I hope that someday, TV may return to shows such as this!!",1188086400,6,500,4.825581395348837

2753095,4,B000N2HD6O,"I love the Rockford Files. I own every season on DVD to date. Season Four has demonstrated the obvious effects of overt liberalism. (Which I do not appreciate.) It is actually a little preachy on feminism and homosexuality...

I will still continue to buy the remaining seasons, however, this trend is unfortunate.",1184284800,10,314,5.038461538461538

I can sum it up in 3 words...great!..GREAT!!..G R E A T !!! Each season gets better and season 4 holds true! the only thing that I'm disappointed in that there is NO extras in interviews?? I don't understand why they don't have more on this set, they added a TV special on this one. Im sure there are so many stories with so many actors, but they dont? So in closing, if your a Rockford fan you will want this one! And I will be looking forward to season 5!",1183939200,4,537,3.9357798165137616

And including the classic season 5 episode ""White on White and Nearly Perfect"" featuring Tom Selleck as Lance White, makes this set a must have! I'm looking forward to having all 6 seasons of Rockford on DVD, it's the best detective show ever. Between the acting, the writing and direction, you just can't beat it. James Garner was extraordinary as the cynical, reluctant hero. And the supporting cast was top notch. A true TV classic.",1183852800,6,513,4.840909090909091

8174217,5,B000N2HD6O,"I meant to note that there is one glaring error in the description, however. It is stated to be a ""paperback"" when, in reality, it is DVD Video. I ordered it thinking I was getting a book, as I already had the videos. Even though it is a duplicate in my library, I am not overly concerned, because I now can loan out Volume 4 without fretting over its return.

Rock Files has been, is, and probably always will be my favorite television show of all time.

I'm grateful mostly that the series was made available on high quality media, unlike so many other classic television programs.

Few actors had the gift of class that they could combine with a folks, yet sarcastic demeanor, that James Garner polished into smooth, seemingly effortless display the man from Oklahoma perfected.

Garner was a bridge between the era of great natural actors of the big screen, Ward Bond, Henry Fonda and James Stewart, and  the up and coming stars of television that so often made their mark in westerns, but then found the transition to post-Wild-West TV to be a challenge.

Huggins was key to understanding Garner's magic, as he knew what made Bret Maverick work and seized upon that with Rockford Files. Cannell learned a lot from his work with both men and went on post-TV to establish a great reputation as a novelist, concentrating his efforts on detective novels. Without Rockford Files, and without James Garner, I doubt Cannell would have achieved such success writing PI novels.

Cannell directed only the season premier episode, but he wrote the teleplay for several of Season 4's 22 episodes, including the opener, ""Beamer's Last Case.""

Episode 16 introduces Rita Moreno as Rita Capkovic. If you don't know Moreno, this episode is a great insight into the woman who was possibly the most under-rated actress/performer of all time.

All 22 episodes are terrific, but the two I've highlighted aren't the only great stories.

Five stars out of five.",1466726400,2,1944,4.8108108108108105
8174218,2,B000N2HD6O,Some of the DVDs freeze up or skip sections.  I was disappointed because I was unable to watch some of the programs.  Bumber!,1466380800,,125,4.391304347826087
