8202753,5,B000RW3UXA,"Rob Bell uses his talents in great ways! Anything in the NOOMA series is worth checking out again and again...and 'Today' is no different.  I highly recommend this to anyone! It's great for group discussion or for individual viewing.  It will definitely push you to think and will cause individual growth.  Excellent, as always!",1265932800,,328,5.037037037037037
8202754,4,B000RW3UXA,"How much time and energy do we spend wishing things were how they used to be? We often think about times in our past when things were different and want our lives to be like that again. Some of us have even come to believe that our best days may actually be behind us. But if we're in some way hung up on the past, what does that mean for our lives now? How are we and those around us affected if we're not fully present? If we're longing for the way things used to be what does that really say about our understanding and appreciation of our lives today? Maybe we need to learn to embrace our past for what it is, in order to live our lives to the fullest, right here, right now.",1207267200,7,680,4.007352941176471
