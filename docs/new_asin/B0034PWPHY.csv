4069784,5,B0034PWPHY,"A superb trio DVD disc set of Hammers' Columbia releases! Of great interest here because they have not seen the light of day for nearly fifty years! Good clean, crisp and sharp bright transfers! Minimal packaging no booklet but, it matters not! I was delighted to view the full length version of 'Cash On Demand' a taut and superb suspenser with an excellent script with sardonic and alternating comical  dialogue-no spoilers here for those yet to see! 'Never Take Candy From A Stranger' is another gem dealing with (then) with the very real threat of child abduction. 'The Snorkel' another suspenser-worth a look. Three others-all in crisp black & white-don't wait until this set is out of print-you'll never get over it!",1270252800,67,722,4.918032786885246

4069788,5,B0034PWPHY,Its rare to purchase a set of any old movies where all have been entertaining so this is a definite departure from the norm. I had actually seen a few of these at the movies when I was doing the weekend double features back in the 60s. I wouldnt call these nail biting or edge of your seat but they are filled with their share of plot twists which make guessing the end pretty hard. The quality is good and several are close to Film Noir. It turned out to be a very good purchase.,1423353600,,480,4.063157894736842
4069789,4,B0034PWPHY,"If you are looking for the wonderfully rich Hammer horror films, look elsewhere. This is a collection of slow, but enjoyable tales of mystery, told in true Hammer form.

After watching Christopher Lee as Dracula, or the Baskerville heir in two Hammer tales, it was tough to get used to the slower pace of the films in this collection. They are just... different... from the Hammer Films I'm used to, but always seem to have some interesting twist at the end. Even though it took a while to get there, I always enjoyed the ride.

They are good, but definitely not what I expected.",1411948800,3,579,4.5576923076923075
4069790,4,B0034PWPHY,"This time the horror doesn't come from Dracula, but from the six films in this collection.  Sometimes the pacing is slow, but the story is still terrifying, especially in ""Never Take Candy from a Stranger"".  Also included in this set is ""Cash on Demand"", with Peter Cushing.  As a special treat for fans of early sci-fi movies, ""These Are the Damned"" provides a horrific vision of genetically altered humans. Tame by todays sci-fi standards, maybe, but still scary enough to make us think about the future.  You'll have to try to overlook the unpleasant and dated soundtrack in the beginning of this movie.  Overall, a great collection for fans of Hammer horror flicks.",1411430400,,669,4.884955752212389
4069791,5,B0034PWPHY,Glad that these lesser known B&W Hammer gems are out.  They aren't Hammer's bread and butter but these films do show that the old studio could do more than colour remakes of old Universal horror films.,1408838400,,201,4.583333333333333
4069792,5,B0034PWPHY,"Six masterworks are released here in this DVD collection from the British film studio who gave us such gothic horror classics as Horror of Dracula (1958), The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), and The Mummy (1959).  Continuing Hammer Films high production values and intriguing stories, these films are sure to please suspense movie fans and are must haves for all Hammer Film collectors.  The six films featured in this collection are as follows:

Stop Me, Before I Kill! (1960)
Alan Colby (Ronald Lewis) and his newly wed wife Denise, (Diane Cilento) have just experienced a head on collision with Alan sustaining a serious head injury.  Leaving the hospital Alan and Denise are encouraged to continue their honeymoon in the South of France. Alan and Denise return to the South of France and while kissing Denise, Alan is suddenly and unexpectedly struck with a compulsion to strangle her! They meet Dr. David Prade (Claude Dauphin), a local psychiatrist, who suspiciously takes an interest in Alan, while seeming more than just a little bit too friendly with Denise.  Alan and Denise decide to return to their home in London, England.  The psychiatrist follows them and taking Denise into his confidence, he convinces her that he his Alans only hope for a full recovery. Alan reluctantly agrees to see Dr. Prade and undergoes several sessions of hypnosis.

The story becomes more intriguing and suspenseful as Denise mysteriously disappears and Alan is suspected of her murder.  Filmed in glorious black and white and directed by Val Guest, Stop Me, Before I Kill is an enjoyable suspense thriller that both intrigues and keeps you guessing!

Cash On Demand (1961)
Peter Cushing brilliantly takes on the role as an unsympathetic bank manager who is blackmailed into robbing his own bank by a cunning and clever gentleman-thief Andre Morel. Cushing is top notch in his role and you can feel his desperation to keep his family from being harmed.  Cushings character has little to nothing to do with his staffs personal lives and he has bullied them relentlessly.  He now finds himself needing their help and sees his error in keeping to himself and not taking an interest in his staffs lives.

The story is set during Christmas and you get a feeling of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol, from the pouring snow outside the banks windows, the stingy and hard character of Cushing is reminisce of Scrooge and the staff characters are like Bob Cratchet.  The whole film is wonderfully entertaining and one that you will want to visit again soon after watching!

Maniac (1963)
Maniac opens with a young Annette Beynat (Liliane Brousse) teasing some school boys as they all laugh and depart a school bus. A sinister looking man is watching her and desiring her as the boys kiss her and then leave Annette, as she walks home.  The man drives his pickup truck beside of Annette and offers her a ride.  She looks undecided for a moment and then decides to take him up on his offer and gets in the truck.  He forces her out of the truck and assaults her while one of the school boys, who followed them on his bike, hurries off to tell the girls father.  Annettes father arrives on the scene and takes the man back to their house and murders him with a blowtorch.
The movie moves on to the next scene as we meet a handsome playboy, Paul Farell, (Kerwin Mathews) who is down on his luck, after just breaking off with a wealthy young woman. He meets Eve Beynat (Nadia Gray) and her step-daughter, Annette. They operate a small hotel in Southern France, while Annettes father has been committed to the insane asylum for killing her assailant. At first, Paul is interested in Annette, but Eve easily manipulates Paul into falling in love with her and soon a scheme to free her husband from the insane asylum is put into action.  Eve convinces Paul that once her husband is free, that she can get a divorce and then be free to marry Paul.

Everything isn't as simple as Paul believes it to be and one twist and turn after another begins to untangle the spiders web that Paul finds himself in.  Fine performances from the entire cast, as well as a tight suspense storyline, makes Maniac a notch above the average suspense film.

The Snorkel (1958)
Candy Brown (Mandy Miller) believes her mother's ""suicide"" was orchestrated by her suave and cunning stepfather, Paul Decker (Peter Van Eyck). Candy also suspects Paul of murdering her real father in a drowning accident that in her words was no accident.  Candys companion, Jean Edwards (Betta St. John) accompanies her home. Jean has an obvious affection for Paul and keeps telling Candy that her accusing Paul of murdering her mother must stop.  Paul acts hurt and sad by Candys continual accusations that he murdered her mother, but soon he decides that Candy is discovering more than she should about what really happened and he must get rid of her.

The atmosphere and creepy settings of the house where the murder took place is top notch and gives the film a Hitchcock feel with Mandy Miller giving a wonderful performance as the daughter who is dedicated to bringing her parents murderer to justice.  The finale scene, which brings the murderer to his just reward, reminded me so much of a perfect Hitchcock moment that I almost applauded.  The Snorkel is a treat for fans of classic suspense films and an added treasure to the Hammer Films suspense collection!

Never Take Candy From A Stranger (1960)
Jean Carter, (Janina Faye) nine-year-old daughter of the town's newly-appointed school principal, Peter Carter (Patrick Allen) and his wife Sally (Gwen Watford), is playing in the woods with her 11-year-old friend Lucille (Frances Green), when Jean discovers she has lost her purse containing her ""candy"" money. Lucille tells her she knows where they can get sweets for nothing, and leads her to an imposing mansion, from which the owner, Clarence Olderberry, Sr. (Felix Aylmer), a tall, gaunt man of 70 has been watching the girls from a window.

The film consists of a story that was very daring for its time, which deals with taking advantage of a child and how a community responds to the event when the person accused of the crime is a wealthy resident who has great influence with the towns elected officials.  The ending is very suspenseful and will have you on the edge of your seat.

These Are The Damned (1963)
An American tourist, Simon Wells (Macdonald Carey) is robbed by a gang of teenaged boys, assisted by the leader's sister, Joan (Shirley Anne Field). But soon afterward she jumps to the victim's boat to escape her brother's King, (Oliver Reed) incestuous jealousy. Simon and the gang leaders sister take off together in his boat and is hunted down by the entire gang. During the chase they all enter onto high-classified military territory.  The group discovers that the government has created a race of children that are being conditioned to survive a possible third world war that would leave the world in an atomic radioactive state of life.  The government military soon discovers the intruders and begins to hunt them down.

This is an interesting movie that is fun to watch and one of the better 60s sci-fi films.  It was sort of like The Wild One meets Village of the Damned, with the biker-type gang encountering the spooky kids from the village of the damned.  Oliver Reed, once again, does an exceptional job in his role as the gangs leader.

The set contains three DVDs, with 2 movies on each disc.  The discs are not flipper discs, but contain the movies on one side of the disc. Each film is in glorious black and white and the film prints used are very good and look sharp.  The audio is clear and sounds great on my surround sound system.  As mentioned in other reviews, the DVDs are stacked on top of one another in the case, however, don't let this keep you from purchasing this collection. I purchased a set of DVD cases that house 3 DVDs individually and simply transferred the DVD jacket and the discs into the 3-DVD case.",1402531200,3,8000,4.760492040520984

We get to know the other side of Hammer besides the traditional monster, vampire and supernatural films which to this day are still loved and enjoyed (specially remastered) ""Icons of Suspense"" is actually quite good. Well scripted and directed with good drama and of course excellently acted.

4069799,4,B0034PWPHY,"Although production values are clearly evident in these four films, aside from THE SNORKEL, you will need extreme patience to view the other three movies.

4069800,4,B0034PWPHY,"Columbia/SONY's ""Hammer Icons of Suspense"" Collection has a bunch of films (""Stop Me Before I Kill"", ""Cash on Demand"", ""The Snorkel"", ""Maniac"", ""Never Take Candy From a Stranger"" and ""These are the Damned"") that were released in the early sixties just before I started to check the papers regularly for film trade, but was aware of ""Psycho"" and major films that some of these films were designed to ride on the coattails of like ""Maniac.""  The average Joseph Losey film presents a lot of problems and ""These are the Damned"" (AKA: ""The Damned""), his contribution to ""the art film of Hammer"" is almost laughable.  Losey ruined the prospects of ""Modesty Blaise"" in 1966 which could have been a great franchise package.  Val Guest, another director of note is included here with ""Stop Me Before I Kill"" (AKA: ""The Full Treatment"") starring Diane Cilento (""Negatives""), Claude Dauphin and Ronald Lewis in a well-acted mystery that is too a bit convoluted and contrived. Val Guest helped write and direct the mess that became ""Casino Royale"" and also ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the World."" Guy Green, a wonderful director and cinematographer (he directed ""The Magus"""" and ""A Patch of Blue"") is represented with ""The Snorkel"", a story about a nearly perfect crime is an excellent, taunt film.  ""Maniac"" was written by Jimmy Sangster and directed by Hammer's Michael Carreras and stars Kerwyn Mathews (""Seventh Voyage of Sinbad,"" ""Jack the Giant Killer""). ""Cash on Demand,"" based on a play, stars Peter Cushing in a rather complex role.  Unfortunately these films can not be considered Hammer Horror.  Hammer released them while they were bordering on obscurity at the time of their release and it is any wonder they are required to be ""unearthed"" for us now.  The oldest of these films is ""The Snorkel"" (1958) probably the best, although the obscurity of interest to some in the set, a rather reverse ""Reefer Madness"" on child molestation called ""Never Take Candy from a Stranger.""  I think Columbia had the weakest link to Hammer, although I consider ""Scream of Fear"" from the ""Icons of Horror"" Collection a masterpiece.

Never Take Candy from a Stranger, a story about an old Child molester, I'm sure must have been way ahead of its time, very direct portrayal, the real little girl in the film was very good in her role.
These Are the Damned, Probably the strangest film in the set (I'm still not sure how to even classify it) the ending will haunt you.
The Snorkel, was really fun, a battle of wits between the older man and the young girl, a great film.

4069808,3,B0034PWPHY,"THE FULL TREATMENT

**1/2 British psycho-thriller. Sex with her husband means certain death for poor Denise Colby so she restrains herself for the time being and contents herself with nude sea bathing in the Mediterranean while Doctor Prade's concupiscent binoculars are observing her (gasp!). After these exciting beginnings, I admit that I nearly felt asleep during Allan Colby's psychoanalysis before waking up for the finale. In short, the film is 30 minutes too long but will certainly please amateurs of British thrillers.

CASH ON DEMAND

** My favorite scene of Cash on Demand is the opening credits one with superb travellings driving us from the main door of the bank to its strongroom. The rest of the film is watchable with an agreeable outdated charm but I often had the feeling to see a play and not a film. Good Peter Cushing performance, though. Already forgotten.

THE SNORKEL

**1/2. Routine British thriller with at least two great scenes: the first describes van Eyck's pre Jaws shark-like attempt to drown Candy and, of course, the film's last scene. Just too bad that Hammer preferred a happy ending to a more disturbing and cruel one. Recommended to Hammer fans and nostalgic ones though.

MANIAC

** One or two interesting scenes like the final scene in a gravel pit that could have been used as a set for H. Rider Haggard's She. That's about all. Recommended to Hammer films fans, only.

NEVER TAKE SWEETS FROM A STRANGER

***1/2 A very good surprise. The movie could have been sanctimonious but isn't. The theme is very daring considering it was shot in 1960, the photography - thank you, Freddie Francis - superb and the villain one of the most disturbing characters I've seen in a long time. Highly recommended.

THE DAMNED

***** Joseph Losey is outrageously disregarded nowadays, let's admit it. Like Richard Brooks, he must wait for a better future and crawl through history limbo with a hopeful smile. Take The Damned for instance, a sci-fi mystery produced by Hammer films during the Cold War: nobody cares for it. After five minutes, you know for sure that this film is directed by an auteur and not by a yes man obsessed by special effects or the description of improbable aliens. The Damned could very well be the best movie ever produced by the British production company. Masterpiece.",1327449600,7,2322,4.88295165394402

We have a large, not huge, TV and the picture quality is good.  We are always a bit skeptical when you get multiple movies for a relatively low price but these are very nice.",1325635200,,457,4.033333333333333
4069810,4,B0034PWPHY,"A wonderful performance by Peter Cushing in ""Cash on Demand"" dominates this collection, but most of the rest of the films are enjoyable as well.  Hammer Studios had a remarkable record of churning out movies that were not always great, but very seldom were they actually bad.  This collection typifies the studios style, with generally well made movies containing reasonably good performances.",1323907200,,393,5.32258064516129
4069811,5,B0034PWPHY,"I won't waste your time by telling you what you already know, that all of these films are top notch and of excellent quality.  HOWEVER, one reviewer pointed out the TERRIBLE packaging provided by SONY in that there is no protection for the discs which are stacked up on each other and easily subject to scratching.  Today after finishing my viewing I took a couple of paper towels and traced the circles around a disc, then cut them out and cut holes in the center.  RESULT. GREAT PROTECTION FOR EACH DISC.",1319932800,,506,4.538461538461538
4069812,5,B0034PWPHY,"I did not even realize these Hammer suspense films were available on DVD until I literally stumbled across them at my local library. The set contains three DVDs - there are two films on each disc, and one can access both films without having to flip the disc over.

All the movies are in glorious B&W, and the print quality is mostly good. The special features on all discs are the original theatrical trailers for each film. Disc One contains Stop Me Before I Kill! (run time: 108 minutes) & Cash on Demand (starring the great Peter Cushing, run time: 80 minutes); Disc Two contains The Snorkel (run time: 90 minutes) & Maniac (run time: 86 minutes); and finally, Disc Three contains Never Take Candy from a Stranger (run time: 81 minutes) & These Are the Damned (run time: 95 minutes). Total running time is 541 minutes.

Some of the noteworthy titles in this collection are : Stop me Before I Kill! which is a taut, twisted, psychological drama which is reminiscent of classic Hitchcock; then there's The Snorkel about a young girl who tries her desperate best to convince those around her that her stepfather is a murderer; and the uber rare and chillingly creepy Never Take Candy from a Stranger about a young family new to a small town and how their lives become entangled with an aging child molester.

Definitely recommended for fans of classic psychological suspense!",1312934400,3,1376,4.725
4069813,5,B0034PWPHY,"I totally agree with some previous reviewers. This collection comes with 6 movies that are all about psychological suspense (Stop me before I kill, Maniac), well accomplished thrillers that are based on interesting scripts and good camera work (The snorkel). Moreover, in ""These are the damned"" you have a feature that starts as a typical gang movie, but goes into a more science fiction twist. May be the most disturbing (yet excellent) of the 6 is ""Never take a candy from a stranger"" as it goes into the always awful topic of pedophilia. Among Hammer celebrities, you will see an excellent acting by Peter Cushing and Andre Morell in ""Cash on demand"" or Oliver Reed in ""These are the damned"". Excellent, crisp, sharp and widescreen DVD transfers. English subtitles included. I would say the packing is a bit too simple (all three disks mounted on each other), but my copies arrived without any problem.",1295740800,2,905,4.883116883116883
4069814,5,B0034PWPHY,"I was looking for some quality entertainment for the Halloween season and picked this collection up in a store.  It was a ""used"" copy so I bought it at a good price.  (If it wasn't used I probably would have held onto my money.)  But....boy, I am so glad I purchased this.  The movies are excellent and make for exciting, thought-provoking viewing. I don't want to give away too much, but offer here just a few observations and insights into the collection.  And this collection is worth every penny! There are 3 discs with 2 movies on each and are as follows:

1) ""Stop Me Before I Kill""  - This is the weakest and most predictable of all the films.  But it is still well-written, acted, directed - and the end may very well have been the inspiration for the ending of the recent ""Shutter Island.""

2)  ""Cash on Demand"" - Based on a play and seeming very much like a filmed play actually helps in creating that perfect sense of confinement and being trapped that is essential to the plot.  There is a touch of ""A Christmas Carol"" to it, also - and Peter Cushing gives perhaps the best performance of his long career in this movie.

3)  ""The Snorkel"" - This movie is like an episode of ""Columbo"" in that the crime is shown in the beginning sequence but instead of Peter Falk we rely on a young girl to solve the case. There is the sparring twixt killer and ""investigator"" that was the largest part of the ""Columbo"" series. And in this movie there is a basset hound that will surely remind you of Columbo's pet dog which had a recurring role in several of the ""Columbo"" episodes. But all ""Columbo"" similarities aside, this is one heck of a film!

4)  ""Maniac"" stars Kerwin (""Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"")Mathews in a movie that isn't as good as the two mentioned above, but it has a fantastic locale (the south of France) and a keeps-one-guessing story-line that by-and-large works.

5)  ""Never Take Candy From A Stranger"" left me slack-jawed.  It is an amazingly powerful film conveyed in the simplest of ways - and the story-line is perhaps even more relevant today than it is when the film was made.  This is frightening film - but not due to gore and guts and graphic excess.  It is frightening because it is so subtly done and shows like no other film I can think of ""the banality of evil.""  This and ""Cash on Demand"" are the two best features in the collection.

6) ""These Are The Damned"" is totally unpredictable and utterly engaging - because you don't have a clue where it is going. And Life is like that.  So on this one especially, rid yourself of any and all expectation as to where it will lead you.

There is no CGI in any of these films, no blood and guts that are supposed to be shocking but no longer are because they have been used time and again to the point of overkill (all pun intended) ;  no...these films (three of which are bona-fide classics by my lights), these films rely on strong stories, excellent acting and fabulous direction and photography. And the music doesn't constantly dictate how you're supposed to feel as strongly as movie scores of today often have a habit of doing. These are movies from a time when plot was paramount, when dialogue mattered, when the film-makers knew how to walk the tightrope subtly without falling into the net of sensationalism.  This collection is a treasure-trove of obscure films that might have been forever lost without the advent of DVD.  So I suggest you get 'em while they last!  (Unless, of course, you prefer fast-paced, action-packed, overly scored, underwritten, CGI laden movies that have, sadly, become the norm for these hectic, hellish times.)",1286150400,15,3622,4.556414219474497

4069820,5,B0034PWPHY,"As someone who is not really into horror movies, but whose husband is a fan of classic horror, I know rather more than I ever expected to about the genre. For instance, I know that if it's a Hammer production, I'll probably like it even in spite of the vampires and whatnot.

The Icons of Suspense brings back six Hammer movies that don't fit the horror or noir or adventure categories (which Hammer also produced.) There are no wolfmen or supernatural beings, just nerve-wracking tension in the tradition of psychological thrillers. These six selections feel like B-movies, low key without any big stars or big budgets. Because of an arrangement Hammer Films had with an American producer in the 1950s, when these movies were made, all of the British movies feature at least one American actor.

The video and sound quality are good, unlike the uneven quality of the Hammer Noir series, which are also fun to watch nonetheless.

Here are quick thumbnail descriptions of the six movies, listed here in my order of preference, starting with my favorites.

Cash on Demand - Inspired by A Christmas Carol, features Peter Cushing as a Scrooge-like bank manager whose bank is the target of an elaborate robbery undertaken by a charming con-man. Great acting all around, keeps you guessing through a series of twists and turns.

The Snorkel - Despite the atrocious title, this is a very tense tale of a murderer whose stepdaughter is on to him but can't convince anyone else that he's evil. Nice location shots in the south of France. This had the most perfect ending of any movie I've seen in a long time.

Maniac - Another movie filmed on location in France, this time the wild southwest. An American who's just been dumped by his rich girlfriend finds himself stranded in a small town, where he meets a beautiful teenager and her attractive mother. He's quickly ensnared in a web of some kind, but pretty boy is slow on the uptake.

Stop Me Before I Kill - A race car driver who's recovering from an accident has barely controllable urges to strangle his new wife. The couple meets a friendly (perhaps too friendly?) psychiatrist while visiting the French Riviera. What's triggering the homicidal compulsions? Who can he trust?

These Are the Damned - This is supposed to be some kind of lost classic, with teddy boys and Oliver Reed in an early role. I found it a messy mix of noir and sci-fi with social commentary tossed in. Entirely unbelievable and too long.

Never Take Candy From a Stranger - A cautionary tale whose title is completely non-ironic. A British family newly arrived in Canada becomes embroiled in controversy when a cartoon-like dirty old man, a scion of the community, leches after the nine-year-old daughter, who was lured by the promise of candy. Melodramatic and too long.

4069821,5,B0034PWPHY,"I just wanted to log my positive vote for the terrific 1963 Hammer Film, 'These are the Damned'. It's great that they're now releasing this classic sci-fi/horror film in an omnibus Hammer package DVD set.

*The Story*

An American yachtsman [Macdonald Carey] gets a less-than-welcome reception in England when he runs afoul of a motorcycle gang but he continues to challenge them, even helping the gang leader's sister escape their dominion of her life.

Meanwhile, a group of super-intelligent children are being raised and schooled by British scientists in a super-secret cave-like underground location near the coast. It's not long before the yachtsman, not comprehending the danger that these children pose to himself and others, tries to aide them. Big trouble ensues.

The only shortcoming of this well-directed film is the music which is badly dated [think Drive-in, sock-hop, bongo-beat, cheesy, 50s music!] But this doesn't prevail for very long -- it's just a song or two that the producers stuck in.

Otherwise, the cinematography is exemplary, the acting is first-class, and the story is solid. This is a full-length film, presented in letterbox format, and shot in black-and-white. The movie leans more toward being creepy than scary.

Don't miss it -- highly recommended.",1278720000,3,1285,5.2745098039215685
4069822,4,B0034PWPHY,"I got this set mainly because of the restored and full length version of the Losey film ""These are the damned"" , and an interest in Hammer films generally. ""TATD""  is a strange film that starts off like a naff teen movie with a bad theme song, but gets better as it progresses eventually  evolving into a supenseful character based  ""discussion"" of pessimism/fatalism Vs creativity/life. Alexander Knox and Vivica Lindfors are excellent as the 2 secondary  characters who actually embody the opposing principles of the story. ""Cash on demand"" is an undiscovered gem - Peter Cushing and Andre Morrel in a tightly scripted and directed tale of a Con man and a martinet Bank manager. Great acting by both the leads, and a satisfying outcome to a tension filled day in the life of both men. ""Never take sweets (""candy"" in US) from a stranger"" is another unheralded classic. Sensitively handled and very well acted story of a child molester in a Canadian town, and how the townsfolk, and the parents of one  young girl in particular, deal with the issue. The film is not exploitative or sensational, and raises a number of issues that are still pertinent today. Of these 3 films I have watched so far all have been well restored/cleaned up, and the prints are in excellent shape - good blacks and contrast, little overt grain and no nasties or scratches. Audio is fine. I look forward to watching the rest of this set. However, if only for the 3 films mentioned above the set would be worth it. Recommended.",1273363200,6,1502,4.695817490494297
4069823,5,B0034PWPHY,"""The Icons of Suspense Collection: Hammer Films"" is Sony's follow-up to their two other Hammer sets. The films featured in this set are some of Hammer's most obscure. All of the six included are debuting on Region 1 DVD. Having written reveiws for other Hammer product, I would like to put down my thoughts on this set, disc by disc.

Disc One

STOP ME BEFORE I KILL! stars Ronald Lewis (TASTE OF FEAR, MR. SARDONICUS) as a man convinced he's being driven to kill his wife. The film was directed by Hammer veteran Val Guest, which means it has some interesting details, but with a running time of 108 minutes, the story is a bit overlong.

CASH ON DEMAND This film has about three or four sets, a small cast, and not much action--yet it may be the best picture in this set. Peter Cushing stars as an anal bank manager, and Andre Morell opposes him as the mysterious and somewhat charming bank robber, ""The Colonel"". Cushing and Morell spend most of the movie verbally sparring with one another, but the actors are so good, and the tension so high, you'll forget you're just watching two guys talking. Peter Cushing is my idol, but I have to admit, Andre Morell steals the show.

Disc Two

THE SNORKEL Peter Van Eyck (who starred in a number of German Edgar Wallace thrillers) stars as a man who thinks he's committed the perfect crime. This picture has a great opening, and it also features Betta St. John (CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, HORROR HOTEL).

MANIAC This is one of several ""mini-Hitchcocks"" that were written by Hammer's Jimmy Sangster in the early 60's to capitalize on the success of PSYCHO. If you've seen the other Sangster Hammer thrillers (TASTE OF FEAR, PARANOIAC, NIGHTMARE) you'll know pretty much what to expect and you'll probably be able to guess the plot twists. Film buffs will note that the leading man is Kerwin Mathews, who may have been the best Sinbad ever.

Disc Three

NEVER TAKE CANDY FROM A STRANGER This is a drama about, believe it or not, child molestation. One would think right off the bat that because it is a Hammer film, it's pure exploitation, but this is actually a well-crafted, serious, and gripping story. Out of all the movies in this set, this one surprised me the most. It stars Hammer favorite Patrick Allen.

THESE ARE THE DAMNED This well-renowned, cult science-fiction film is making it's DVD debut in the longest version of the movie available. While watching this, I was constantly reminded of THE BIRDS (the coastal setting, the slow build-up, the camera looking down on the characters and the action from far away). I won't give away the story, but here's a few items of note: in the beginning of the film, Shirley Anne Field wears some of the tightest pants in entertainment history (at least until Robert Conrad in ""The Wild, Wild West"" came along), and the soundtrack has a rock & roll song, ""Black Leather Rock"". The song's lyrics are so over the top that it almost ruins the story's mood.
This was directed by Joseph Losey, a man beloved by critics. The movie is excellent, but I wonder how much of a reputation THE DAMNED would have if it had been helmed by one of Hammer's regulars. Oliver Reed plays the crazed gang leader King, and like most of the Hammer roles Reed played, he makes a bigger impression than the leading cast.

Overall, if you are a Hammer fan, or someone who appreciates classic suspense movies, this is a must buy. This set doesn't contain any of the cheesy Hammer monster movies beloved by fans, but it will pleasantly surprise those who have never seen or heard of the films included in this set. All the films here are black & white, but they are all in widescreen and the picture and sound quality is superb for product that is almost all fifty years old. Once again, Sony hits it out of the park.",1271203200,26,3776,4.58074074074074
4069824,5,B0034PWPHY,"Sony's ICONS OF SUSPENSE sets the highwater mark for releases in their ICONS series so far. This is the third in the series after ICONS OF ADVENTURE and ICONS OF HORROR to feature releases from England's Hammer Films. Two other sets, ICONS OF SCIENCE FICTION, feature Japanese movies from Toho Studios and low budget offerings from producer Sam Katzman. There is also an ICONS OF HORROR set featuring Boris Karloff. All three Hammer releases have featured lesser known fare although Columbia Pictures (now part of Sony) released more Hammer offerings than any other major American studio. What makes this set especially appealing is that none of these films have appeared on DVD before and they are presented uncut and in their original aspect ratio which is key to at least two of the films (NEVER TAKE CANDY FROM A STRANGER, THESE ARE THE DAMNED) which feature stunning black and white cinematography. Unlike the previous two ICON releases, you get 6 movies with this set instead of 4.

All of the films were made and released between 1958 and 1963 after Hammer had made it big with their Gothic horror films. They also made a number of so called ""psychological thrillers"" in the vein of PSYCHO although some were made before it. Disk 1 has STOP ME BEFORE I KILL  which dates from 1958 and shows the dark side of psychiatry. CASH ON DEMAND, from 1961, features a taut script and one of Peter Cushing's best non-horror performances. Disk 2 has THE SNORKEL (1958) and MANIAC (1963), about a perfect crime and a twisted killer, are the least of the set but still worthwhile. Disk 3 is worth the whole package for it contains beautiful uncut versions of two 1960 classics NEVER TAKE CANDY FROM A STRANGER about pedophilia and THESE ARE THE DAMNED, a multi-layerd offering from Joseph Losey (THE SERVANT). If you enjoy quality cinema on a meager budget then check out what the Hammer team did with these 6 titles. CASH ON DEMAND and Disk 3 are so good, I could watch them over and over again.",1270771200,37,1989,4.696275071633238
