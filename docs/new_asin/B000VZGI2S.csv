8220705,5,B000VZGI2S,A tale of hubris and learned humility wonderfully performed in the wuxia style. Most enjoyable.,1498608000,,95,5.4
8220706,5,B000VZGI2S,"Great movie, highly recommend. It's kung fu and serial killers and hubris. Highly essential from 1982, I think Shaw Brothers. You'll never forget the villain.",1495411200,,158,5.36
8220707,3,B000VZGI2S,"This official HK DVD version in NOT anamorphic widescreen. A huge let down if having a 16:9 HDTV (and who doesn't have one these days?). Therefore, you'll have to hit the zoom button on your DVD or Blu-Ray player remote for ""simulated"" anamorphic widescreen. The English subtitles are small and hard to read. All being said and the only upside, the picture quality on this HK DVD release is actually good and much better than the US Image Entertainment DVD release.",1494115200,,465,4.753086419753086

8220709,5,B000VZGI2S,"A very good revenge flick.
The true gruesome nature of the crimes is lost due to modern effects and greater details in comparison to the time it was made, but that doesn't lessen the film and story.",1481155200,,198,4.378378378378378
