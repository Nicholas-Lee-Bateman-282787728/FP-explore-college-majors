The way many of the scenes were shot demonstrated a director who really understood how storytelling could be different on film than on stage. But the real credit here goes to Basil Rathbone and Kay Francis, both of whom were able to invoke in the viewer, the exact emotional response needed for their characters. Basil is charming and seductive and Kay is able to take her character from one extreme to the other so believably. For anyone who's had their life destroyed by someone with no moral compass, Kay's journey from the girl who ""had it all"" to a completely broken individual, is all too familiar. She manages to truly convey this both by her physical transformation and the emotions she projects. This movie is a tear jerker but not sappy. Very well done and worth inclusion in any diverse movie library.",1520121600,,913,4.6770186335403725
8727046,5,B0137I9AU2,"The movie is a scene-by-scene mirror image of the 1935 German film Mazurka, which was based on actual events in Europe. An opera star is pursued by a womanizing musician who ruins her marriage. The opera star seeks revenge and goes on trial for her actions. This is a fascinating story with good acting and intrigue throughout. Viewing Confession is time well spent.",1489881600,,366,4.825396825396825
