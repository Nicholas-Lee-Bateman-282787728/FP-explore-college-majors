8089607,5,B000BNSHD8,"Indeed, it took many years after the creation of this film, but still this film evokes strong emotions. This picture is impossible to watch without tears. And I want to thank all the creators of this film and in particular the leading of actor by named Bim. This dog is left in the soul an indelible impression. His fate was a sad and cruel. He had to know betrayal, humiliation and cruelty on the part of the people. But even through these trials of life he retained to love to his master. And after watching the film, a question arises, who turned out to be more human: dog or people? I think the answer is obvious.",1419811200,,617,4.327586206896552

8089609,5,B000BNSHD8,It's a DVD. A disc of plastic that you put in a machine. The machine reads the data and displays the film. The smallest child is now familiar with the concept. I  don't propose to do a full lit crit of the film - this is just about the means of delivery. Anyway I bought it for my girl-friend. Better ask her what it's about. I just forked out the spondoolics. Well that's it Amazon. That'll be 20 plus VAT/IVA please.,1267228800,,418,4.160493827160494
8089610,5,B000BNSHD8,"This is a wonderful movie that I purchased recently since I saw it once as a child and remember it having a deep effect on me.

** Note ** Some spoilers ahead.

The movie tells the story of an old retired hunter and his dog, that while purebred, looks like a mutt. The movie is about the relationship the man has the dog and then the relationship between the dog and society.

It's a heartwrenching film and definitely different than typical Hollywood movies.",1207699200,6,459,4.506024096385542
