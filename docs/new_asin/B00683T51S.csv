It's definitely more tailored for kids as it tends to feel like it was written by a 12 year old at times.

4973414,5,B00683T51S,"Our youth film critics reviewed this and here is what one 14-year-old had to say:

Journey 2 is a fun and entertaining movie and offers some brilliant eye candy in some of the most impressive action scenes. Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has a new man in his life, his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson). This movie is more about the relationship between Sean and Hank than a mindless clich adventure movie. Sean grew up with a lot of loss of loved ones and people coming in and out of his life. Sean has trust issues with his new stepdad and doesn't want to get too close to him, for he's afraid that he'll leave him due to his unfortunate past. Hank wants to play a bigger role in Sean's life and hopes to finally make a bond between them. Then they uncover the mystery of the Mysterious Island and go on an adventure to find Sean's long lost grandfather (Michael Caine). The only way to get to the island is by flying by helicopter. The quirky and fun tour guide (Luis Guzman) is the comic relief in this huge journey. His daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) is Sean's love interest in the movie. The plot itself is easy to understand for younger audiences and is fun to see how it plays out in the end. The movie is chockfull of massive set pieces which all are creatively brought to life by cinematography and editing.

Vanessa Hudgens doesn't deliver the most believable performance of her career because of the fact that she acts more like a big-city girl then a hardened islander of their destination. All in all she has great chemistry between Josh Hutcherson in the movie, and should be amended for it. Luis Guzman however, delivered some tongue-in-cheek jokes throughout the film. He'll offer a couple of chuckles throughout the movie for older viewers, but most of his jokes will appeal to the younger audience. I like this movie because of its frantic action sequences and surprising suiting soundtrack. This movie may be scary for younger viewers at points such as the lizard chase sequences. The intensity and the importance of the given situation during the final act of the movie gives the audience a very good reason to sit on the edge of their seat. Overall, I think the movie was very entertaining and had many great moments.

4973415,3,B00683T51S,"You just can't hate it, no matter how you try. It's a family picture starring Dwayne Johnson popping his pecs, singing ""What a Wonderful World"" (with different lyrics), fighting an electric eel and riding a huge bee. (As for the last one, Sir Michael Caine does it, too.) The story of ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"" directed by Brad Peyton (""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore""), is certainly corny, full of physically impossible moments, but somehow I enjoyed watching the film that is silly but entertaining.

Very loosely based on a famous Jules Verne novel, ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" chronicles the fun adventures of four characters crash landing on an uncharted island in the South Pacific. They are a 17-year-old American boy Sean (Josh Hutcherson, reprising the role he played in a 2008 movie ""Journey to the Center of the Earth""); Sean's step-father Hank (Dwayne Johnson); Gabato, a local tour guide in Palau (Luis Guzmn) and Gabato's daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens).

After one of the most incredible code cracking activities performed in the movie history, Sean and Hank have discovered that Sean's grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine), who has been missing for two years, is living on the mysterious island. Of course, they are right. The thin story is just a pretext for a loosely strung series of set pieces with special effects. The 94 minute film is a concoction of ideas possibly inspired by classic Swift / Stevenson novels and one legend everyone knows. (But didn't I write ""Pacific""?)

The film is good, clean fun. There are no ""villains."" Just a monster lizard and other digitally rendered creatures. Shot in Hawaii, the location is very beautiful. Elephants are cute. And don't forget Dwayne Johnson popping his pecs. What else do we need?",1333497600,,1784,5.040677966101695
4973416,4,B00683T51S,"MOVIE REVIEW #23: "" Journey 2: Mysrterious Island""

Okay, I am not a big fan of Dwyane ""The Rock""  Johnson (Scorpion King, Fast Five) but he is in this film to sell tickets. He's simple and acting as himself - no big surprise here. What surprised me was the fresh take on the script written by brothers Brian and Mark Gunn from a story by Richard Outten. They took Jules Vernes original story and mixed with a few others to create was is basically a sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brandon Frasier. However Brandon is not back for this one, his son played by Josh Hutchison (Hunger Games, Red Dawn) is.

The story is an adventure that Josh's character wants to partake and his step-dad (Dwyane) wants to take with him. Of course, they are reluctant at first, but later realize that two lessons can be learned. (Basically each trying to prove the other wrong!) I like the humor and fun of the adventure in the film. It's no Indiana Jones, but definitely a fun film.

Of course, it's an exotic, unapproachable island where Josh's grandfather, amazing played by Michael Caine (Batman Begins, Prestige, The Cider House Rules) is suspected to be looking for the actual Jules Verne `Mysterious Island' - complete with the Nautilus and Captain Nemo himself!

In order to get there we meet a ragged helicopter pilot played by Luis Guzman (Boogie Man, Arthur) and his daughter, the love interest, played by Vanessa Hudgens (High School Musical, Sucker Punch). Well of course the father gets them stranded and Vanessa has caught Josh's eye.

The movie spends most of its time trying to get these five people of the island because it is sinking, however the effects are pretty sharp and the humor is witty. The ending is suspenseful and even had all the kids in the audience applauding at the results of the families working together. Quite cute.  This is a fun family film with giant bees, spider and miniature elephants too! Great fun for the family. Not high concept, not boldly broad in theme - just plain family fun! (3-2012)",1331510400,,2037,4.657381615598886
4973417,5,B00683T51S,I got to see this in the theaters 2 weeks ago and it met my expectations. It was a very good movie. I like the special affects and how colorful and beautiful the island and creatures on that island is. And even though I was disappointed Brendan Fraiser wasn't in this movie the Rock did a good job acting in this. And normally The Rocks acting is hit or miss its good in some movies and in others not so much. I can't wait for the third one. I'm hoping both Brendan Fraiser and the Rock show up in the next film.,1330646400,,512,4.029411764705882

4973419,3,B00683T51S,"Because of the way that Pixar blurred the boundaries of adult vs. children's movies beginning with the ""Toy Story"" franchise, it is difficult to rate kiddie fare in this day and age.  In the case of ""Journey 2"", however, the verdict is quite clear: The kids will sit through this one, while the adults will be looking at their watches or hitting the concession stand.

For a basic plot summary, ""Journey 2"" sees young adventurer Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and his step-dad Hank (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) travel to the Mysterious Island foretold by Jules Verne.  While on their way to rescue Sean's grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine), the pair is accompanied by a comedic-relief airplane pilot (Luis Guzman) and his beautiful young daughter (Vanessa Hudgens).

There are some things that this film does get right: It most definitely covers all its bases.  Young boys will love Hudgens, Johnson has pretty much a universal appeal now, and  adults will smile to themselves at the presence of Caine.  The cringe-worthy comedy from Guzman is even well-done...when aimed at the kiddies, of course.  Plus, the visuals are stunning and the whole island adventure is magical.

The trouble, of course, is that there is no plot development and only forced character growth.  In this way, it is very much geared for the minds of children.  Everything is predictable, and the characters act exactly as expected throughout.  Even the sappy message at the heart of the film is geared for the young minds.

Thus, from an ""adult"" point of view, I would struggle to give this film two stars.  From the eyes of a child, however, there would be much more enjoyment (if not touching Pixar's level or anything like that, of course).  As such, this is a ""middle-of-the-road"" 3-star experience.  The visuals are nice and some of the characters are fun initially, but enjoying it any further requires a childhood perspective.",1328918400,,1901,4.968354430379747
4973420,3,B00683T51S,"The writers and producers of this film were smart enough not to have Dwayne Johnson play the role of Brendan Fraiser. Sean, the son, is back and lives with his mom and step-dad in teen prison, known as Dayton, Ohio. Dwayne is intelligent and understanding. When Sean gets a cryptic message, Brainiac Dwayne Johnson helps him decode it. Sean wants to go to the Island and find his grandfather, who he thinks sent the message. Dwayne, who is trying to connect with Sean, decides to humor him and very quickly into the film, we are at Mysterious Island.

Luis Guzmn plays a local helicopter pilot who along with his pretty daughter Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella Montez of High School Musical) are capable of getting the foursome stranded on the Island. Once they meet up with Michael Caine, there is some ridiculous rivalry dialouge that doesn't fit well into the film. The special effects were good. The humor and story was aimed at the kids who enjoyed the picture far more than their parents with some scenes being downright juvenile. Sean, of course, has a thing for the island girl, who plays hard to get. All this is going on while the volcano blows smokes and oozes lava.

Some cheesy fun. 3D effects...unfortunately bounce right at you.

No F-bombs, sex, or nudity, Pure PG goodness. Good one for the kids (pre-teen and younger). WARNING: Dwayne Johnson sings. 5 STARS for kids, 3 stars for the adults who sit through it.",1328918400,,1423,4.729838709677419

But if you're going to constantly inject scientific principles into the movie, at least try and abide by some very basic ones. So the island, which is Atlantis, completely destroys itself while it sinks and rises every 140 years. And in this 140 year cycle, the island is completely repopulated with flora & fauna, that evolves the complete opposite of what it is, only not proportionally. The tiny organisms grow to millions of times their original size while the large ones shrink to a hundredth of their original size.  But nothing co-evolves. Like most island movies, the food chain is upside down, with virtually no herbivores and an island full of carnivores. Also the ancient Atlantian ruins are somehow re-build each time the island re-emerges. Apparently the nautilus has been udner the island for over 1 hundred years, but there are no crustacean growths on it and the overhead hatch is easily opened, because it wouldn't rust in salt water of something.....Anyway enjoy the movie!",1514592000,,1164,4.878787878787879

4973521,3,B00683T51S,"Review of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island
Hot Toasty Rag, December 1, 2017

I actually didn't know this when I watched it, but Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is the sequel to the 2008 remake of Journey to the Center of the Earth. Brendan Fraser didn't come back, but Josh Hutcherson did, and the story follows him as he and his stepfather, Dwayne Johnson, go to the famed Mysterious Island and meet up with his long-lost grandfather, Michael Caine.

If you're expecting a lighthearted kids flick, youll be very entertained while watching this movie. Its got some incredible special effects that immerse you in the environment; every time theres a Mysterious Island movie, I love seeing the gigantic plants and animals. Josh is sweet and easy to root for, and Dwayne is given some pretty funny comic relief bits. And who wouldnt love travelling to an exotic fantasy island with Michael Caine as their guide? Its a very fun movie, if you don't mind seeing Michael playing grandfather to a teenager, and has a lot to offer for everyone in the family. While lots of movies claim to be fun for all ages and are really only enjoyable to toddlers, this one can truly be watched by the whole group. Grown-ups will be entertained by the grown-up actors, teens will be interested in Josh and his romance with Vanessa Hudgens, and the little ones will be awed by the scenery.",1512086400,,1367,4.691666666666666

4973560,3,B00683T51S,"Whoa......so bad....so bad.  Artwork beauty drags one through the film as the acting and script constantly kicks the viewer in the ""shame dept"" for continuing to voluntarily watch this pap.  The action scenes were okay-ish but the physics were constantly bogus.  Ride a giant bee?  Yeah the physics on that deal are easy peasy, right.  This thing had ""Disney World Theme Ride"" written all over it.  It was insulting.

I saw the trailer, so I have only myself to blame.  I thought maybe the script was better, but everything was so ridiculous.  Can't see most kids watching this, because of so many lovey-dovey scenes.....stupid soap opera scenes......and even kids should pick up on the bad acting.

4973855,3,B00683T51S,"In this sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth, the kid from the first one is now living with him mum and stepfather (Dwayne Johnson), he has a bad attitude to authority as well as the man married to his mother. Even when that stepfather uses his influence to keep him out of a pretty much certain six month jail sentence for endangering countless lives in a dirt bike police chase where the kid finds a one of a kind slippery dip that runs into the ground rather than having room for the kid to put their legs down, sit up, then stand up and get off that you find everywhere else. After doing this for him he still shows him no respect.  The kid has a puzzle to solve that will connect him with his grandfather that of course the stepfather solves with him. Of course that puzzle solution is a bunch of coordinates in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  The dumb kid starts packing his bag and instead of his mother and step father laying down the law, the step father decides to burn through thousands of dollars in cash flying with the kid to the middle of nowhere.  Of course there is no island at those co-ordinates so they have to land in some fictitious nearby small country, where luckily everyone speaks English.  There they meet a dodgy helicopter pilot who knowing full well there is nothing at those coordinates tells them he will take them there for large wads of cash.  For reasons I can't fathom especially when they are supposedly struggling to pay the bills and extra weight will use more fuel his daughter also comes along.  However a sudden storm appears at the coordinates, and following the kids hunch that there is a scene with a storm in a Jules Verne book, they fly into a tornado type thing that destroys their helicopter but safely puts their bodies on the sand all together on a small beach surrounded by cliffs.  They then find an island where things that should be big are small, and small things are big.  But they don't have long to get off or they will die, for reasons you might as well find out by watching the movie.

The movie is sort of like Sharknado for kids.  There are so many things happening that raise questions, contradict an earlier part of the plot, basic physics or just aren't explained at all, such as how do you make a bee fly wherever you want and risk itself being eaten just by jumping on its back?  Why would it not just sting you with it's stinger to protect the hive and the queen, which we never see?  Plus with no real predators shouldn't there be thousands of insects all over the island?  Why has the grandfather made signs for everything in his tree house when it's not real likely he's going to be getting visitors and how did he get the parts from the boat to make it all the way to where it is?  There's also ridiculously convenient Ewok style logs on rope traps in the exact right spot. Plus I'm pretty sure that all these animals would drown every 140 years, how do they reappear again?  Surely the larger animals like the plane sized birds would just fly to the mainland.  Why don't they take a photo of any of these things except for the map? You could just head towards the ocean if you got lost and walk around the circumference of the island anyway.

This is a movie that uses some seriously obvious green screen standing in front of, or running in front of, as well as CGI animals. It's watchable for a laugh, just like you watch Sharknado or something you know isn't going to be even 1% believable just to enjoy and laugh with other watchers as to how bad it is.  If you go in with that mindset, Journey 2 The Mysterious Island is quite enjoyable viewing.",1452902400,,3633,4.357037037037037

4974151,3,B00683T51S,"The question you're probably wondering is, Why is there a ""2"" in the title?  Is it a sequel?  Well, not exactly.  It's more of a, sort of a, kind of a...continuation.  Not that Hollywood hasn't made other movie versions of ""The Mysterious Island""; this just isn't really one of them.  No, the filmmakers called 2012's ""Journey 2:  The Mysterious Island"" number ""2"" because it features the same young character, Sean Anderson, we met in 2008's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" Sean now off on another adventure; and because Jules Verne wrote both stories.  OK, the ""2"" is a stretch.  I think it may have confused potential moviegoers more than enlightened them.  Not that the movie itself doesn't do that all by itself; it makes little sense in any case.

What the folks at New Line appear to have wanted in the new movie was to duplicate everything audiences liked about the previous film, which from my perspective was precious little.  It means they loaded the new movie with lots of CGI, exotic scenery, and action, action, action.  What they forgot was a coherent story line or halfway believable characters.  And, of course, they made the film in 3-D again, so watch for the gimmicky shots meant solely to show off the 3-D process.  Thank goodness the Blu-ray disc I watched is in regular 2-D, or I'd have to have endured the dim picture quality so beloved of 3-D fans.

Warner/New Line obviously intended ""Journey 2"" as a family picture, but the emphasis is heavily on younger members of the family.  Indeed, the film may be downright insulting to most thinking adults, and since I'm an adult, that's the way I had to view it.  I can only guess at what children might think of it, although I have no doubt many of them would like it for its picturesque locales and colorful escapades.

Still, as an adult, I found the picture a typical DAM:  a dumb adventure movie, where even suspending one's disbelief entirely doesn't help because the events are so harebrained.  Don't expect a serious family adventure here like ""Jurassic Park.""  This one is more like a ""Jurassic Lark.""

The returning character, Sean (Josh Hutcherson), is now a few years older, in his late teens, and being a dedicated Vernian, he's ready for another Jules Verne adventure.  The big difference this time out is that Brendan Fraser, who played Sean's uncle in the first movie, is nowhere around.  Apparently, he'd seen that first film and declined any offer of returning.  Replacing him we find Dwayne Johnson, playing Sean's hunky stepfather, Hank.  But Sean resents his step dad and rejects any attempt by Hank to be his friend.  Needless to say, the adventure they go on together helps them bond and become a real family.

OK, so Sean is just hanging out, moody and dejected, when he gets a coded message from his uncle Alexander (Michael Caine), another dedicated Vernian, about the location of Jules Verne's ""Mysterious Island.""  So off go Sean and Hank (in the middle of the school year) on an expedition to the faraway isle, a place filled with majestic scenery and gigantic reptiles, spiders, and bugs.

But you can't have just two people on an adventure; you have to have the requisite comedy relief and the requisite beautiful girl.  Accordingly, Sean and Hank pick up a guide, Gabato (Luis Guzman), and his sexy daughter, Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens).  The daughter just happens to be about Sean's age; nice coincidence.

You can guess the rest.  The movie sets the tone in the opening sequence where we see Sean on a motorcycle chased by two police cars as he zooms in and out of backyards and winds up in a swimming pool.  Maybe the film is not so much dumb as it is stupid.  Keep remembering it's for kids.

Anyway, the movie has more than its quotient of jump-the-shark, what-are-the-odds moments:  For instance, the ""Mysterious Island"" rises out of the sea and then returns every 140 years, and the heroes arrive just hours before it's ready to sink.  The heroes outrun a giant lizard.  The heroes get around the island by flying on the backs of enormous bees.  The girl falls about 10,000 feet, and Sean safely catches her.  Sean and Hank devise makeshift scuba tanks on the spot to breathe underwater.  An electric eel powers a submarine's batteries.  And so on.

The movie also contains any number of all-out silly moments:  For example, in a homage to the famous 3-D paddleball scene in ""The House of Wax,"" Johnson bounces berries off his pecs and directly at the camera.  A little later, perhaps in a homage to the original ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" with Pat Boone, Johnson plays the ukelele and warbles a song.  Then, there are those CGI critters and landscapes that look glorious but are about as realistic as a Pixar animation.

The fact is, the group of people at the center of the story are the least-appealing folks you'd ever want to be stuck with on a deserted island.  Sean is a sullen, spoiled, pushy, childish character; Hank is a Superman; the grandfather (with Caine in full Richard Attenborough mode) is a dotty old know-it-all; the girl is something of a standoffish snob; and the guide is a fool.  The group bicker and argue endlessly, rather lessening our enjoyment of the adventure.

Director Brad Peyton's only big-screen movie before ""Journey 2"" was ""Cats & Dogs:  The Revenge of Kitty Galore,"" if that gives you any idea about this newer effort.  Yes, you can take some comfort in the beauty of the Hawaiian panoramas standing in for the ""Mysterious Island"" or in the sight of the lost city of Atlantis.  Yet these are temporary diversions; the rest of the movie is pretty weak.

Video:
Warner/New Line have transferred the movie to Blu-ray disc in its native aspect ratio, 1.85:1, using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec.  The colors range from slightly pink-purplish on occasion to bright and vivid most of the time, which is a welcome change from the colors on the earlier ""Journey"" movie.  However, because this was originally a 3-D production, the filmmakers shot it digitally, and the PQ looks soft and mostly flat.  The image has a cartoonish appearance, which I suppose suits the movie perfectly.

Audio:
The lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is the best part of the show.  As we would expect from a modern action-adventure movie, the soundtrack displays a wide frequency response, a strong impact, and a good use of the surrounds.  The midrange is fairly natural sounding, too, and bass lovers will appreciate the deep low end.

Extras:
The primary bonus item is an interactive, informational map ""Are You Strong Enough to Survive Mysterious Island?,"" which takes you to various parts of the island and provides background material on the filming and such.  There are two levels, ""Interactive"" and ""Junior Explorer.""  Next is a very brief (one minute) gag reel, followed by five deleted scenes totaling about six minutes.

The extras conclude with a meager ten scene selections; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Then, because this is a Combo pack, you not only get the movie on Blu-ray but on DVD and UltraViolet digital copy as well (the latter offer expiring June 5, 2014).  The two discs come housed in a flimsy double Eco-case, further enclosed in a light-cardboard slipcover.

Parting Shots:
Although, as I've said, Warner/New Line intended ""Journey 2:  The Mysterious Island"" as a family adventure, they aimed it squarely at children, not adults.  For kids, it's fine; they'll probably enjoy all the color, action, and preposterous goings-on.  However, for adults it's a pretty tedious affair, on the intellectual level of an old-time ""Flash Gordon"" serial or Donald Duck cartoon.  While it's harmless enough, be forewarned.",1433808000,,7786,4.852807283763278

4974191,4,B00683T51S,"I seem to be one of the few who enjoyed Journey to the Center of the Earth when it was released a few years back, so I was surprised to see a sequel was planned.  I guess the original made enough money.  I knew immediately I'd be going to see Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.  And I enjoyed it, too.

In the time since his first adventures, Sean (Josh Hutcherson, the only returning cast member) has become a Jules Vern fanatic.  Which is why he immediate recognizes a code he's gotten made of character names from Jules Vern books.  Along with his step-father Hank (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), he deciphers it and discovers it gives clues to The Mysterious Island.  Sean is convinced that it came from his grandfather.

Eventually, he and Hank set out to find the island.  They hire Gabato (Luis Guzman) and his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) to fly them out there on a helicopter.  Will they find Sean's grandfather (Michael Caine)?  And can they get off the island again?

Okay, let's be perfectly honest here.  This is a kid's movie.  Yes, it has action and fantasy and plenty of comedy.  But kids are the target audience.  Now, that's definitely not a bad thing in my book.  I fully recognize this is not ""great"" cinema.  It's designed to be a fun movie, and I enjoyed it as such.

The story is not terribly original, although I got so caught up in it that I really didn't care.  There is plenty of action to keep you engaged even if you know how it is going to end.

And I can't forget the comedy.  The packed theater I saw the movie with laughed multiple times, and it sounded to me like the adults were laughing as much as the kids.

The film is filled with special effects as well, and they worked.  While I knew what I was seeing couldn't be real, I believed it.  While the movie was released in 3D, I didn't see it that way, so I can't comment on how that looked.

And the acting worked, too.  It's not outstanding, but it gets the job done without pulling you out of the film.  Plus we learn that Dwayne Johnson has a pretty decent singing voice.

There were some flaws to the film.  There was a certain level of cheese, especially most of the times the film tried to do anything serious.  And on that note, the interpersonal relationships were so predictable it was a bit annoying.

Then there's Luis Guzman.  I'm not sure if it was him or how his character was written, but I found him more annoying than funny.  I would have preferred the movie without his character.

I realize that I will be in the minority for enjoying Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, but I found it to be entertaining.  And since that's all it was really aiming for, I think it succeeded.",1432598400,6,2681,4.389002036659877

I'm just an adult male who enjoys watching action films but not violence, which is hard to come by.  Even most ""kids"" movies have a fair share of violence or violent laden tension.  This movie was good clean adventurous  and beautiful fun, that kept me interested the entire time.  I usually do not make it through most movies I start, so it is refreshing when I do.  The acting was not overly spectacular, some of the things that happened were a bit fantastic, but nothing that made the movie dull or uninteresting.  The Rock was also very charming as well as humorous, and even though he was not supposed to be the hero of the movie, his undeniably formidable physical presence made it easy to not get too worked up when things got perilous.",1430611200,,823,4.410596026490066

Within the first 15 minutes or so we are introduced to Vanessa Hudgens' character. You can tell that the main character really thinks that she is a good looking just by dialogue alone, and then they needlessly pan down to her chest. Why does this always happen to the female lead in action movies (ex Star Trek, GI Joe)? Always the damsel in distress, and the object of ""affection"" of the main male lead. The theme keeps going throughout the whole movie.

Instead it winds up being a long action film with elements of Robinson Crusoe or Swiss Family Robinson tossed in there.

Not a bad flim as such, but really aimed at a younger crowd that can buy into miniature elephants and over sized rideable bumble bees.

The dialogue was just bad to the point that it was like the characters knew they were in a movie and were reading lines off of a script.  Also when the Polynesian girl shows up, she might as well just shake Sean's hand and say, ""Hi!  I'm your love interest for this movie and we'll be dating by the end!""  Cuz it was very obvious that was what was going to happen.

Also there are times in the movie that I was just rolling my eyes and knew that these things were done just so they would have things to make the 3D effects look cool.  For example when berries are bouncing off of the Rock's chest and flying at the camera.  Also the bird chase where it ends in an explosion of feathers.  Not to mention that whole chase scene made me roll my eyes and say, ""well I guess we're back on Endor for this scene.""

The story was outlandish, but being loosely based off a turn of the century sci-fi book, that was expected.  Good flick to watch with the kiddos.",1400716800,,270,4.254901960784314
4974763,2,B00683T51S,"I'll come right out and say it: I'm not really a fan of this film.  I like the first one, with Brendan Fraser -- it has plenty of action, gets you emotionally involved with the characters, handled the inevitable romance in a way that didn't make me want to barf, is just cheesy enough to be fun without being too stupid, and the 3D effects make it worth seeing.  All in all a good film for days when I want to switch off my brain for 90 minutes and enjoy some mindless escapism.

This sequel meanwhile is so dull.  It's not well-paced, and any onscreen tension quickly vanishes before it has a chance to produce thrills.  Because we couldn't have that.  The very idea!  It's almost as if the director was going out of his way to make this boring instead of an action-packed adventure film.  The few chase scenes and stuff that we do get rely so heavily on Matrix-like slow motion shots that it starts to get tedious.  They also manage to make me feel more sympathy for the animal ""monsters"" involved than the actual human protagonists.  Speaking of the humans, the characters are bland paper cutouts who can be reduced purely to their function within the story: the hero.  The hero's future girlfriend.  The comic relief.  The step-dad.  The crazy grandfather.  And so on.  The romance feels forced and and cliche and treats the girl pretty much just as an object for the hero to pursue and win in the end.  Because that's why we girls exist: so guys can date us.  Anything else is crazy talk.  (Rolls eyes in disgust.)  The dialogue meanwhile is ridiculous.  Some of the interchanges make me laugh, and not for the right reasons.  The one decent thing about this movie is the Rock -- and sadly he can't save it for me.  I honestly get more enjoyment making fun of this film than actually watching it.  It also doesn't help that unlike the first Journey film, the DVD release just has the 2D version; I think 3D might make it a little more palatable.  But I'm not gonna buy a BluRay player just so I can see one film in 3D that I don't really like anyway.

Bottom line: Kids will probably enjoy it I guess.  Everyone else will die from boredom.",1400544000,4,2145,4.419437340153452

This is the follow-up to the 2008 hit!

Unable to stop him from going, Sean's new stepfather [Dwayne Johnson] joins the quest. Together with a helicopter pilot [Luis Guzman] and his beautiful, strong-willed daughter [Vanessa Hudgens], they set out to find the island, rescue its lone inhabitant and escape before seismic shockwaves force the island under the sea and bury its treasures forever.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: `Journey 2: The Mysterious Island 3D' is a sequel to the 2008's family oriented action and effects extravaganza `Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D.' As with its predecessor, it does not adapt the Jules Verne novel of the same name, but instead tells a new story set in modern times based around the premise that Verne's fiction was based on fact, and modern day ""Vernians"" are actively working to crack codes hidden in his and other contemporaneous works that will unlock the secrets to visiting fantastic locales. This sequel begins with Sean Anderson [Josh Hutcherson], receiving a coded transmission that he is convinced is coming from his Grandfather Alexander [Sir Michael Caine] stranded on Jules Verne's Mysterious Island.'

With the help of his stepfather, Hank [Dwayne Johnson], he makes the connection that Verne's Island is actually the same island referenced by Robert Louis Stevenson in ""Treasure Island"" and by Jonathan Swift in ""Gulliver's Travels."" By combining maps from all three books (don't ask what editions, just roll with it!), they are able to pinpoint the location in the Pacific where the island must be. With the help of helicopter tour guide Gabato [Luis Guzm&aacute;n] and his daughter Kailani [Vanessa Hudgens] they locate the island, but find themselves stranded, a situation the becomes more critical when they discover that the island is not so slowly sinking into the sea.

As a rule, I am not always keen on sequels that either barely connect the dots to their predecessor or completely re-hash their predecessor (I'm looking at you, rubbish obnoxious Hangover 2'). `Journey 2: The Mysterious Island 3D' somehow manages to do both, and yet I found it to be overall a more enjoyable experience than `Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D.' While in the first film, Josh Hutcherson was the tagalong nephew attaching himself to his Uncle's quest to track down their missing father/brother. This film simply flips the roles with Josh Hutcherson now a dedicated ""Vernian"" dragging his sceptical stepfather along on the journey. They even shamelessly repeat the device of stranding them with a tour guide and daughter conveniently age appropriate to be a chastely romantic interest for Josh Hutcherson.

Sir Michael Caine is in full-on hamming it up scenario chewing mode, and while excerpts from this film will never show up on his career highlight reels, his performance is exactly what the 3D film calls for. His constant barbs thrown in the direction of Dwayne Johnson's Hank character are not particularly witty or even dramatically earned in the context of the story, but they are delivered with a great deal of relish by Sir Michael Caine. It does not hurt that Dwayne Johnson is such a good sport and not afraid to look ridiculous either, but that was also the case with Brendan Fraser in the first film.

For whatever reason, there is simply a better comic chemistry between Sir Michael Caine and Dwayne Johnson that there was between Fraser and some of his nondescript co-stars. Luis Guzman's mix of comic buffoonery and sentimentality as the tour guide is also more in keeping with the fun and forgettable tone of the film than the more competent tour guide from the first film. In summary, the film presents a modestly fun, mostly preposterous and ultimately forgettable action and effects romp that will likely please its target audience of ten year olds. Who knows? It might even trick them into reading a Jules Verne book.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `Journey 2: The Mysterious Island 3D' gets a shiny 1.85:1 and with a 1080p encoded image presentation, and it looks excellent. Colours leap off the screen, fine detail is through the roof, and contrast is rock-solid. The only downside to such a vibrant, squeaky-clean picture is that it kind of betrays the film's reduced budget: it sort of looks and feels like a television show, highlighting the line between a set and a digital backdrop. Of course, even that's sort of reflective of the image's quality: it's showing you a level of detail the filmmakers might not want the viewer to notice. Warner offers up a transfer whose bright colours pop off the screen. There is a lot of eye candy to be absorbed; lush green jungles, deep blue oceans, and scaly drooling monstrosities. The picture has a deep clarity that makes everything look crystal clear.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is fitting of a big adventure picture. Rumbling hurricanes, tumbling rocks, buzzing bees, screeching birds, an underwater electric eel, and Dwayne Johnson's singing voice are all replicated with crystal clarity and nice directionality. It's been awhile since I really felt like I was getting the theatre experience watching a film at home and to be fair, probably more indicative of my film selection than any audio deficiencies, but this really felt like a blockbuster, with great immersive, weighty mixing. I even liked Andrew Lockington's score, which is understated, but pleasingly so. This is the kind of 3D film that features all kinds of rollicking surround sounds. The front, rear, and side speakers are all engaged without any obvious defects.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: All the following extras are presented in 1080p video with Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo Audio via the DVD disc only.

Special Feature: Are You Strong Enough to Survive Mysterious Island? [2012] [1080p] [21:07] This is a series of documentaries that are viewable in either of two selectable modes called ""Interactive"" and ""Junior Explorer."" The ""Interactive"" mode asks the user to make a selection after each documentary that guides them towards another section of an interactive map that corresponds to another documentary. The ""Junior Explorer"" mode simply plays all ten documentaries straight through in a predetermined order. Both modes are preceded by a 24 second introduction from Josh Hutcherson [""Sean""]. Once all ten documentaries are viewed in either mode, the viewer is treated to a congratulatory message from Josh Hutcherson and a minute and a half of outtakes from the film. The documentaries themselves mix behind the scenes information about various sequences and design elements of the film with related ""real life facts"" from experts in biology, geology, scuba diving, and Jules Verne. The documentaries topics and durations are as follows: Giant Lizard [1:56]; Atlantis [1:51]; Tree House Set [1:45]; Giant Flowers [1:50]; Volcanic Mountain of Gold [1:36]; Giant Bees [2:15]; Glowing Mushrooms [1:23]; Captain Nemo's Tomb [2:10]; The Ocean (Water Tank) [2:04]; The Nautilus Submarine [2:12].

Deleted Scenes [2012] [1080p] [5:54] This is a collection of five scenes that did not make the final cut of the film. A number of them feature unfinished effects which appear as crude animatronics and blue screen backgrounds mixed in with the live actors. The individual scenes are not selectable from the disc menu, but they are encoded with chapter stops between them. Scene descriptions follow:

1. Discussion by the group of five island adventurers about how animals can survive an unusual recurring event that happens to the island.

2. Some extra arguing between Sean, his mother, and Hank after Sean's arrest at the beginning of the film. This scene directly references the events of the previous film.

3. Alexander, Kailani, and Gabato face some additional jeopardy from falling pillars.

4. A fairly long scene from early in the film where Hank seeks parenting tips from one of his employees on a construction site.

5. Some additional congratulations, teasing, and sentimentality near the end of the film aboard a submarine.

Special Feature: Gag Reel [2012] [1080p] [1:15] This is a mercifully brief assemblage of on-set flubs, falls, and goofing around set to fast paced music.

Finally, `Journey 2: The Mysterious Island 3D' is full of adventure and excitement that should be fun for the entire family. And while this isn't a direct telling of Jules Verne's story, I think this is a great way to introduce your children to a variety of classic literature, as this movie pulls a little from a variety of some of the best-known authors. Furthermore, with such a great presentation, this Blu-ray will definitely become a family favourite. I would definitely recommend going 3D on this film. Either way `Journey 2: The Mysterious Island 3D' is very enjoyable, but the 3D truly completes the experience. Like the previous `Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D' Blu-ray release, I was worried this film would be a total dud, as Dwayne Johnson is a professional wrestler and is not a trained actor, but I was pleasantly surprised how good he was in this film and it is a brilliant follow up 3D Blu-ray and a great Double Feature and is also a stunning brilliant 3D presentation that will have your guest have a great jaw dropping entertainment and again I am so proud to add this to my ever increasing 3D Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

4974886,3,B00683T51S,"An elderly friend who's also a movie nut lent this to me and my wife, sure that we would love it.  While I wouldn't exactly say this is my cup of tea, I do like adventure cheese like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-the-Earth-s-Core/dp/B00005O06Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At the Earth's Core</a>&nbsp;so I was hoping I'd at least be in for a fun B-movie experience, though I was honestly fully expecting to not like it at all.

The story starts with a very Irish kid racing home away from the cops.  He apparently broke in somewhere to steal some kind of distress code based on the writings of Jules Verne he was trying to interpret.  We then learn that Conan O'Brien Jr's step dad is The Rock and some typical step-family friction ensues.  The Rock decides to connect with Lucky Charms by helping him figure out his code in a scene that literally is over in three minutes.  Code broken, they discover its coming from Guiness McJameson's grandpa who's one some mysterious island that some 19th century authors all reference in their fiction, blah blah blah off they go to find it.

Who will take them to the island?  Why its helicopter pilot and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greendale/dp/B002N5N5LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greendale</a>&nbsp;alumni Luis Guzman and his daughter, whom Potatoes O'Toole immediate falls in love with thanks to a leering cheesecake shot that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Bay/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Bay</a>&nbsp;would be proud of (frankly, its more than a little pervy how much they sexualize the daughter character given that both the young lead characters are apparently in high school).

Now that everyone's in Guzman's helicopter, of course they crash and of course the island is big and colorful and full of CGI creatures.  In this case its large creatures are small and small creatures are large, although what constitutes a ""large"" or ""small"" creature is very very arbitrary and not particularily consistant.  The gang gets chased by a big lizard, find Dropkick Murphy's grandpa (played by Michael Cane, now with more free time than ever since Batman retired with Catwoman), discover the island is sinking/blowing apart because of a golden volcano (don't ask), ride bumble bees, and do plenty of other light adventure fare.

Its all pretty ridiculous, but these movies usually are, so no complaints here.  What I did appreciate was that this movie kept a fast pace, didn't overstay its welcome, and never pretended to be anything it wasn't.  The characters don't bicker or scream a lot, there's no heavy-handed emotional parts and the actors all do okay with what is a *very* weak script, but its all in good fun and seeing Guzman work hard to sell very corny jokes is pretty amusing in itself.

So in the end, its an okay movie.  Its as cliche and ridiculous as it gets but its unassuming tone and fast pace makes it a fun enough watch.  Its nothing I need to own but kids will love it and chances are most adults will find it much less annoying than a good 60% of the alternatives.",1390780800,2,3194,5.3687374749499

4975018,3,B00683T51S,"Much like a fairy tale, hard to believe in what you see and hear. There are many very predictable moments in plot and witty humor along the way. Again we meet the same boy from the first movie and that's what I dislike. I don't like that actor. He is obnoxious, annoying like in other movies and I also dislike his attitude and to see him fall in 'love' with a girl right from the start of the movie is very 'original'. A girl was an unnecessary character. Didn't like her, because her character reminds me of other girlish characters from other movies. I think the decoding of the message that took place in the beginning of the movie was a little too fast. Everything happens fast, even getting to the mysterious island. The special effects, creatures, plants, all look unrealistic, even bouncing off the ground that happens when the boy falls of the bird or swimming in the water (some parts). By the way how a boy that had hurt his leg so bad he couldn't walk could swim very well by using his legs? Slow-motion was used frequently. Riding the beasts is easy as anything, fear in characters even of the heights is almost absent. Characters that get separated from the group and run a long way in different directions don't have or need to search for others. They are they are in a second or few. Getting lost on an island is impossible. When they say that island goes under water after the period of time nobody mentions what happens to trees, elephants and all that. They must be able to live underwater and repopulate when the island gets dry again. Yet when the volcano's will erupt they'll show an island collapsing in many pieces. If this happens every 140 years, I wonder the island also looks intact apart from other weirdness. The explosion that happens underwater in a few meters away from the submarine does no damage to the submarine and its glass. Still it's an all right movie, was entertaining and not too bad to watch. This movie is for kids, maybe some teenagers along the way. There is just a lot I don't like in this movie. Yet I am giving it 3.5 because it's not a bad movie and maybe, just maybe I would watch it again some day.

Update: Looked at 4-5 stars reviews and I realized that I was right. Many parents write that it is a family movie and their 4 or 7 year old children absolutely love it. If their kids are happy, I see why parents rated the movie so well.",1373587200,2,2390,4.395033860045147

This is meant to be watched in 3D though. There are quite a number of gimmics in the movie that make it obvious so I will update my review once I've seen it in that format.

There was one scene that could have been left out-Dwayne flecking his chest muslces, that was silly; but maybe a young boy might like that and that might have been what they had in mind when doing the scene ( I don't know). It was a good idea to put ""THE Rock"" in this roll, he seems to have a playful appeal to kids, and the setting of trying to connect to his step-son was in good taste too.

They were also smart by making this second movie when Josh is older, because you really can't have any fun with a kid. Well there's a positive and a negative in this cast like they kick the boring guy out and replace him with The Rock,which I already mentioned, now that's good. Now they replace the lady from the first one and add the annoying girl, Vanessa Hudgens, not good. That's really the only bad thing about this film. I was surprised as to how much I really liked this film, and I'm old, so yeah, I loved watching Josh and The Rock, they were great together.

The movie was another story.  The writers and the director attempted to combine three classic books into one film (Gulliver's Travel, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, and Treasure Island).

The movie really had potential, but I feel like they could have put in a bit more effort. There were several scenes that were clearly made for 3D, which is fine, but when you sacrifice a good chunk of time to include nonsense story telling and offer eye candy... you're not improving the film.

But if you can watch the 3D version of this in 3D it is really a lot more fun.  Yes, they throw in some 3D cheap shots (when he does the ""pec pops,"" the berries pop right at you) but as I said, it has a couple of campy spots but they just make it more fun.

Amusing even, esp some of the cartoon-like set decorations & CGI.  Nice eye candy all around but don't try to analyze for any realism or logistics.  I don't have a 3D TV but it's evident where those are & they look like they'd be fun.  I also live in Hawaii where a lot of the scenery was shot, so watching for that along w/ the behind-the-scenes featurettes made it worth the Blu-ray set.

As far the movie goes, we all enjoyed it. There were plenty of funny moments and lots of action. It held the attention of my 8 and 5 year old daughters. I think movie wise this is on part with the first film, and it setups up a couple possibilities for a third, which I would look forward to if they bring back Josh, Vanessa and Rock, it would also be nice to have Brendan back also.

4975314,1,B00683T51S,"Viewing Equipment: Epson 3010 3D PJ on a 92"" Da-Lite Screen. The only thing worse than a bad movie night
is a bad movie night that ultimately becomes a double bill. I made the mistake of blind buying a South Korean
film that I watched the same evening that was also unbearable called ""Quick"" that I reviewed under it's proper
title.

Good news first: It's a short movie thankfully! Michael Caine was enjoyable as always in this kind of role.
The film was at least shot in native 3D unlike most 3D films being released right now that are conversions.
This is a decent family film with no significant objectionable content that prevents many films from being
family friendly. The 3D is very good in several scenes with some nice pop outs and depth is consistent. The
AQ is great! The 3D PQ was good overall, but does have some detractors that I will mention below.

Bad news: The writing and acting are unbearable excluding Michael Caine. I'm surprised this movie has a 4 star rating on Amazon.  I figured it would at least be split with 2 stars, but I guess the 4 star rating indicates that more films like this will continue to be made.  I did make it through the whole
movie which I cannot say for the awful South Korean film ""Quick"" that I fast forwarded through the 2nd half of
on the same night. While I expected the cheese factor to be high; I was also expecting it to come with some
beef. I'm making myself hungry as I write this, but I digress. The first movie is significantly better than the
sequel which isn't much of a surprise, given most sequels aren't as good as their predecessor. This movie
made me start to wish for Uwe Boll since his movies are often so bad they are funny. The 3D had some
ghosting issues that were bothersome, especially when the far off shots that should have had a lot of depth
instead had a rather blurry look to them which was disappointing. This movie jumped the proverbial shark for
me when Luis Guzman's character started throwing cherries at The Rock's pecks as he moved them around
sending the cherries flying back towards the screen creating a nice 3D effect. I really enjoy 3D technology,
but the stupid factor hit a 10 at that point. It was funny, but in a (Wow this movie is bad) sort of way! LOL!

Final thoughts: If you are looking for family friendly material in jaw dropping 3D; there are many other titles
worth your hard earned dollars. 3D BD's are expensive! Just to name a few briefly you could pick; The
Adventures of Tin Tin, Journey to the Center of the Earth part 1, and Under the Sea to name just a few. Imax
3D films are all very family friendly and offer jaw dropping 3D for the most part. If you must own this in 3D
and can't rent it in 3D first; rent the 2D version and see if you can handle it. I could never bring myself to sit
through this tripe twice. Thankfully the BD case arrived in the mail damaged so I knew I would need a
replacement, but I will be accepting a refund instead after suffering through this wasted opportunity.  If you want to watch a really mind blowing 3D movie in HD check out ""The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate.""",1355270400,,3105,4.354058721934369
4975315,4,B00683T51S,"This Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel is cute at best. It should be compared to Disney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Search-of-the-Castaways/dp/B00005JLJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Search of the Castaways</a>. Both following the traditions of Verne novels. This film uses the ideas of Captain Nemo mythos in its adaptation of Mysterious Island.

The problem is this film tries to act adult when it is a child's film. Using references that adults will understand when this film was made for teens and yound adults.

The Rock shows his strong male lead, so he plays Hank , the step=father of Josh. He seems like he acts like he knows everything. Luis Guzman is the comic relief of this film playing the airplane pilot who takes John and Hank to the island.  Michael Caine tries to be the sagely Grandfather of Sean, played by  Josh Hutcherson (the only one who appeared in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-to-the-Center-of-Earth/dp/B001JIDE3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey to the Center of Earth</a>&nbsp;redo). High School Musical's Vanessa Hudgens is the teen eye candy and The token female of this male group> Of course like all Disney-like films.  she becomes Josh's love interest.

If you can suspend disbelief, this film is a cute adventure film for the family. It has a few missteps that you can overlook, It is a special effect man's dreams from flying bees, a sinking island to revising of Nemo's Nautilus. ..so if you love special effects, this is your film

so if you looking for an old family DDisney-like family film, this one will do

4975385,4,B00683T51S,"Journey 2 is a fun and entertaining movie and offers some brilliant eye candy in some of the most impressive action scenes. Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has a new man in his life, his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson). This movie is more about the relationship between Sean and Hank than a mindless clich adventure movie. Sean grew up with a lot of loss of loved ones and people coming in and out of his life. Sean has trust issues with his new stepdad and doesn't want to get too close to him, for he's afraid that he'll leave him due to his unfortunate past. Hank wants to play a bigger role in Sean's life and hopes to finally make a bond between them. Then they uncover the mystery of the Mysterious Island and go on an adventure to find Sean's long lost grandfather (Michael Caine). The only way to get to the island is by flying by helicopter.

The quirky and fun tour guide (Luis Guzman) is the comic relief in this huge journey. His daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) is Sean's love interest in the movie. The plot itself is easy to understand for younger audiences and is fun to see how it plays out in the end. The movie is chock-full of massive set pieces which all are creatively brought to life by cinematography and editing.

Vanessa Hudgens doesn't deliver the most believable performance of her career because of the fact that she acts more like a big-city girl then a hardened islander of their destination. All in all she has great chemistry between Josh Hutcherson in the movie, and should be amended for it. Luis Guzman however, delivered some tongue-in-cheek jokes throughout the film. He'll offer a couple of chuckles throughout the movie for older viewers, but most of his jokes will appeal to the younger audience.

I like this movie because of its frantic action sequences and surprising suiting soundtrack. This movie may be scary for younger viewers at points such as the lizard chase sequences. The intensity and the importance of the given situation during the final act of the movie gives the audience a very good reason to sit on the edge of their seat. Overall, I think the movie was very entertaining and had many great moments. I give this movie 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 10-15.

Describing the same island in three different stories made the plot thrilling and enjoyable.

Now here's how I feel about Journey 2. It was wonderful. I was not sure if Dwayne Johnson could pull it off but he sure did. The entire cast had great chemistry. What I do is preview the movie in 2-D and if I like it ,I then get it in 3-D when there is a sale. From what I saw the visual were spectacular and the story line was just plain fun. This movie is a family friendly winner. Stick around for some of the end credits,they were pretty cool too. This is one I will purchase in 3-D.

The dialogue between the step-father and the grandfather was also not necessary.  Nevertheless, it was entertaining, and fun!

I loved the bantering that the two characters do throughout the entire movie.

As you guessed, it has to do with a mysterious island with strange animals. One strange animal that Sean tries to cotton to is Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens you may remember from the  ""Robot Chicken"" (TV series)).

4975538,3,B00683T51S,"This is probably the goofiest movie I've ever seen, and would definitely not be out of line on the rotation of a Nickelodeon movie special, if they do such things nowadays. A lot of semi-funny and cringe inducing one-liners and gags to be found, and to top it all off, yet another example of The Rock playing to a non-R rated audience. Some may think this as ironic given his bad guy image on WWE, but a look back to his earliest days as a wrestler reveals a man pretty well steeped in the classic ""face"" good guy image that used to define Hulk Hogan and a few others. Interestingly enough, this is pretty close to the same sort of well-intending, but hopelessly campy PG rated film exploits of the Hulkster, though with about twelve times the amount of special effects.

The overall vibe of this movie is cartoon-like, featuring a number of odd sized animals (giant iguanas and mouse-sized elephants) and seemingly impossible scenarios such as riding around on giant bees (the one giant animal held over from the older cinematic portrayal of this story) while being chased by even larger birds. But it's all in good fun and is sure to please any kid between the ages of 3 and 13, though speaking for myself the appeal to adults is pretty minimal, save maybe the classic scene of The Rock bouncing stuff off his pecks and Michael Caine's textbook portrayal of an eccentric explorer, both of which are outright hilarious.

Perhaps the greatest thing about this movie is that it doesn't attempt to put it self off as being a literal dramatization of the Jules Verne novel, but more a sequel/fan fiction take on the story, thus freeing itself from the obligation of taking itself too seriously for the intended audience. It's definitely something worth getting if you have a couple of kids to entertain without having to explain away a lot of the adult themes that are generally common to many PG movies.",1343174400,,1901,4.654761904761905

However, as a 64-year old, although I still love sci/fantasy movies, they have to have more going for them than Dwayne Johnson's ability to bounce cherries off his pecs. The dialog is beyond awful, the acting is perfunctory and even the special effects are unconvincing. Michael Caine proves yet again that, as a working actor, he will take any part offered to him; I'm never really sure whether to applaud his lack of pretentiousness or bemoan his lack of discrimination.

4975603,3,B00683T51S,"This is fun formula movie making on a budget.

Duane Johnson is the likeable star and Michael Cain, not shown on the cover, is a pleasant surprise. The special effects are sometimes cheesy, but only by recent standards set by Avatar, John Carter and others. There is no real need for the expensive effects as Dwane Johnson and Michael Caine are a delight to watch!

The story is what one would anticipate, a Jules Vernes format tale on a island full of surprises and adventure. Some of the dialogue is outright corny, ""Let's have and adventure!"" but who really cares?

You'll see actors doing the usual blue screen flying around on giant bees, pretty much like the special effects tour at Disneyland. It doesn't matter as this isn't meant to be taken seriously anyway.

Now, I love any scene that has lots of panoramic scenery and dense tropical foliage in 3D and I must give it four stars in that department. The artists who designed the sets did a marvelous job here, sometimes coming close to the settings in Tim Burton's Alice and Wonderland. This is comparable to the recent Gulliver's Travels in story and production value with less humor.

If a clever plot is important to you, you can bypass this one, however this is enjoyable fare for the whole family and I think an enjoyable 3 STARS is in order here.

Kids will watch this over and over, guarenteed, and I'm just a big kid fooling around during my retirement years, so guess what?  I'm going to sit down and watch this visual delight again in a few minutes. There  is no one who would not enjoy this great movie.",1341014400,,1574,4.556737588652482

Usual CGI of a Hollywood imaginary blend of Mayan, Aztec, Persian, Egyptian cities with hanging vines of course.

Well, so much for archeology and artifact retrieval. Odd assortment of critters that made no sense from toy elephants to a gigantic Frilled lizard which was an odd adaptation since the frill is meant to make him look larger to predators yet it was the biggest predator on the island. Really cheap graphics that made the CGI butterflies look pasted on the screen and the plants like paper mach props. How the plants and animals survive the islands periodic subduction beneath the ocean was never thought out.

The characters were all Hollywood formula stereotypes meant only to sell a movie. Johnson with his customary narcissistic paste on t-shirt and as a stepfather relating to the usual Hollywood family plot dilemma of a angry male teen. The usual portrayal of a not so bright and bumbling comedic Hispanic character. The usual attractive female sex object for the angry teen. No swearing, no violence, no animals were harmed Disney robotic conformist family friendly offering. Except, any teen over the age of 14 worth his age would just roll his eyes at this script.

A children's movie with a disclaimer at the beginning that says, ""Some scenes may not be suitable for children.""???
Good morality in that our hero teen is shown running away from cops on his motorbike; destroying property and endangering lives. Then the cops let him off because his stepdad is a card playing buddy to the cops. Well, that sends a good message.

If you are looking for Oscar worthy performances, you won't find it here but what you will find is a great, family movie with laughs and action.

My kids are big fans of Josh Hutcherson since his Zathura days so we get happy when we see him.

The kids and I watched the movie and after it was over they wanted to watch it again. That is always a good sign. There are some cool special effects like a tiny elephant and the flight of the massively hairy bees which will have kids very interested.

Yes, there is a little love story as Sean (Josh) is very interested in Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) character but I think the lusty teen thing was mostly lost on them. It is very much played down.

Dwayne Johnson is his likable self as Hank and Luis Guzman is perfect as the weird bi-sexual dad of Hudgens. Honestly I have no idea if he is bi-sexual but there were some weird moments where I felt he was too interested in Hank but that is just me.

I loved Michael Cain as Sean's grandfather, part Indiana Jones, part Jurassic Park creator.

Fun for the whole family. The kids loved the special effects and Dwayne Johnson can pop his pecs anytime for me.

4975618,1,B00683T51S,"I had high expectations for this movie.  Normally, I love this genre: high adventure with lots of CGI.  I assumed it was a no-brainer, who could ruin a readymade concept like this?
They lost my interest during the first few minutes and nothing they could slam at the screen after that could coax me into liking this movie (not even the wildly amusing performance by Luis Guzman).
It's obvious that they spent a fortune on the effects then forgot to waste a dime on the script.  To suggest the story was ""dumbed-down"" for the benefit of children is to do the writers a disservice; they took all of five minutes to slap their story together, ripped it right out of the official playbook of stupidity.  This was Jules Verne for Dummies.  This is what you get when people who lack originality have to muck about with someone else's work.  Worse.  They thought no one would notice the lacking in their script if they ran everything at a breakneck speed.  They had everything working like clockwork, starting with the clich of the angst-riddled brat oozing with attitude (Josh Hutcherson), to the nitwit grandfather (Michael Caine), the comic sidekick (Luis Guzman) and the obligatory babe in training (Vanessa Hudgens), with poor Dwayne Johnson doing double time trying to act out the part of the put upon stepfather.  Every aspect of this movie was a contrivance, there only for the convenience of an inadequately thought out story that was little more than a series of sight gags cobbled together.  What was this, a commercial for the merits of 3D?  (If you didn't get the point straight off, they happily repeated things in slow motion!)
Just once I'd like to see a film without a snotty teen in the starring role.  Not only is it an aching clich, it's also not that entertaining to watch.  Kids like that you ground, you don't take them on vacation and hope they'll snap out of it.  That only works in the movies.  Or not.",1340064000,6,1921,4.658753709198813

But the writing and acting is below even the usual standards for this genre, and even The Rock couldn't charm his way out of it. If you're looking for a nice, escapist adventure family movie, this is fine, but keep your expectations in check. Also, this does have some sexual innuendo and romance subplot - nothing too extreme, but worth mentioning as some parents with young kids are sensitive to this. It flew completely over my own kids heads, so no issue.",1340064000,,576,4.495238095238095
4975631,2,B00683T51S,"The 3D Blue-ray disc of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" starring Brendan Fraser is wonderful. An exciting story and awesome 3D that insures a fun time for adults as well as kids. So I had high hopes for its sequel, ""Journey 2: Mysterious Island"". I was disappointed. Whereas ""Journey 1"" was entertaining for all ages, ""Journey 2"" is aimed specifically for children. Since I'm not a child, my criticism is from an adult's view. First, some of the acting was way overboard. Of course, the sappy dialogue doesn't help matters. In the sequel, the boy Sean (Josh Hutcherson) comes off as so smart-alecky, disrespectful and brooding, he should be in juvenile detention. Until he meets up with his 'know-it-all' grandfather (Micael Caine), who is always laughing at others' misfortunes and mistakes. And the two of them seem to relish every opportunity to make Sean's stepdad (Dwayne Johnson) look like a stupid fool. Supposedly done for laughs, but for a film meant for kids, this sends the wrong message. Then there's the pilot (Luis Guzman) who is a total baffoon. Children might find him funny, he just made me cringe. And the scene with Dwayne Johnson's ""pec-bouncing"", while maybe amusing to children, made me want to hide my face from imbarrassment. Though not nearly as good as the ones in ""Journey 1"", the 3D effects in ""Journey 2"" are done fairly well, which justifies the generous 2 star rating rather than one or zero. If I had watched this in 2D, I would've ejected it within the first 15 minutes. If you want to keep your children UNDER 12 occupied for 90 minutes, this film might do it. But for adults who want to be entertained (either with your kids, or other adults, or even alone), avoid ""Journey 2"" and stay with the 3D Blue-ray of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"".",1339977600,,1787,4.694267515923567

4975633,2,B00683T51S,"Josh Hutcherson returns as Sean from 2008's ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth.""  Now he's a brooding teenager focused on finding his grandfather (Michael Caine) who has been sending him coded messages from some unknown island, not found on any map.  With the help of his very tolerant step-father (Dwayne Johnson), a former Navy sailor, he discovers the location of the island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.

Being a good guy, Hank (Johnson) agrees to finance a trip and accompany Sean to find the island and the grandfather.  Sean's mom (Kristin Davis) pretty much just nods in agreement in the few scenes she's in.  Departing from some fictitious Polynesian island, the two hook-up with a helicopter pilot (Luis Guzman) and his cute daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens).  They then fly this rickety old `copter into an approaching hurricane.  I guess they didn't get the warning??  The next thing you know, they're on the beach of a beautiful mysterious island.

After Sean flirts with Kailani and Gabato (Guzman) does his I'm-so-dumb comedy bit, they find grandpa' Alexander.  Then he and Hank go at each other playfully.  Would you believe that Alexander has found the lost city of Atlantis too?  Most mythology has Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean.  Couldn't they at least call it Pacificas?

I haven't read Jules Verne's novel but I doubt much of the silliness in this film can be found in the book.  For example.  Instead of walking around a large nest of eggs, the adventurers walk on top of them, even after one cracks.  This allows Guzman to fall into the embryonic fluid.  Ewww!  The eggs themselves are about 3 times as large as they should be based on momma lizard's size as she comes running.  I'm not sure how many eggs a lizard normally lays but there are dozens at this location.

I didn't see this in 3-D but I suspect that would have added some fun to the film.  In 2-D, the scenery and animals look very fake to my eye.  This film with a PG rating is aiming at a younger audience and I'm sure many will like the adventure.  For those of us over 13 or so, I'd say find something else.

There's nothing wrong with the Blu ray transfer.  Shot with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio it looks very good.  Maybe too good given the obvious green screen shots and animated backdrops.

Screened because I'm a fan of Dwayne Johnson. So despite the pedestrian screenplay and plot holes large enough to fly a 747 through - with room to spare - I hung tough with the gang and their adventures throughout the film. No fast forwarding.

Definitely a movie kids & families would enjoy and one I would heartily recommend for that market.

The highlight for me was: ""Wow, The Rock can really sing!""

Minor complaints:

- Josh Hutcherson is one of those former child actors who is clearly, if he has any smarts, headed toward character actor territory. A career arc, if he plays his cards right, that will allow a transition from pretentious kid into good paying jobs as crispy weed dealer and/or snarky sidekick. Otherwise, I just can't see it.

- The obvious and strained effort to squeeze 3-D elements into the picture. Director Brad Peyton just tried too hard. A more nuanced and clever approach would've been appreciated.

- The lack of a more interesting story, particularly given the freedom one has when entering this type of genre.

- One tends to hope that filmmakers would try to be more inclusive of parents and/or adults who might screen the production.

Now Sean, his step father, the helicopter pilot (Luis Guzman), and the pilot's daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) need to find a way off the island. Though it's full of unexplored wonders, they're in a race against time to find a way off before the whole island sinks to the ocean floor.

While this is a sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth, it's not necessary to have seen the first installment. Journey 2 is a standalone story, with Sean going on an entirely separate adventure.  As before, this adventure is immersed in classic science fiction. Fans of classic scifi, young and old, will enjoy the numerous references and Jules Verne's Mysterious Island brought to new heights. With creatures of humorous sizes, a volcano full of gold, and other bizarre secrets - this island unfortunately can't be fully explored because of an unfortunate timetable. Of course, suspension of belief must be held for most science fiction movies (especially geared towards children), but the sinking of the island really pushes it.

But for the most part, this was a surprisingly enjoyable, if mostly corny and predictable, movie for young families. While a fast-paced adventure, there is no violence or profanity, so even very young children can enjoy (as long as they don't mind the occasional giant bug).  The acting is good for a heart-warming family film. Hutcherson (""Hunger Games"") and Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson of course steer the story. And the supporting cast provides comedy relief and a cute romantic interest for Sean. Johnson has been doing a lot of family movies lately, and this may be one of his more watchable ones.

The only real problem I had with it is that is seemed to be a movie where people said, lets make it look pretty and have strange sized animals for an hour and a half. That's pretty much what this is. Overall, entertaining but not as good as original. My kids felt the same way. I give it a B, they give it a B+.",1337644800,,1116,4.219626168224299
4975686,3,B00683T51S,"The writers and producers of this film were smart enough not to have Dwayne Johnson play the role of Brendan Fraiser. Sean, the son, is back and lives with his mom and step-dad in teen prison, known as Dayton, Ohio. Dwayne is intelligent and understanding. When Sean gets a cryptic message, Brainiac Dwayne Johnson helps him decode it. Sean wants to go to the Island and find his grandfather, who he thinks sent the message. Dwayne, who is trying to connect with Sean, decides to humor him and very quickly into the film, we are at Mysterious Island.

Luis Guzmn plays a local helicopter pilot who along with his pretty daughter Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella Montez of High School Musical) are capable of getting the foursome stranded on the Island. Once they meet up with Michael Caine, there is some ridiculous rivalry dialouge that doesn't fit well into the film. The special effects were good. The humor and story was aimed at the kids who enjoyed the picture far more than their parents with some scenes being downright juvenile. Sean, of course, has a thing for the island girl, who plays hard to get. All this is going on while the volcano blows smokes and oozes lava.

Some cheesy fun. 3D effects...unfortunately bounce right at you.

No F-bombs, sex, or nudity, Pure PG goodness. Good one for the kids (pre-teen and younger). WARNING: Dwayne Johnson sings. 5 STARS for kids, 3 stars for the adults who sit through it.",1336003200,33,1423,4.729838709677419
4975687,5,B00683T51S,"This movie is an adventure of imagination. The young boy bonds with his stepfather who is brilliant and fun and they go in search of a mystery island where his grandfather lives. The South Pacific is full of sights and smells that would rock anybody into a happy place. Fish that are magenta, purple pink and tropical blue are all on the dock. They hire a loopy young acting flyer and his daughter. He owns an adventure helicopter, rickety and old but it will be part of all the excitement they encounter. They find the shangrila island with big and small animals. The underwater world is breathtaking with masses of colors and plants. A mountain of gold stands out in the distance. The hiking thru the heart of the jungle holds more visual images that are full of what anybody creative would love to have. They are living out the Jules Verne book in a way but with there own special touches. There are whirlwind storms flying all around, sparkling lakes and streams filled with shiny plants and stones, green all over lush and beautiful, everything you would wish for on a secret island. There are bees that fly, the characters jump on their backs and zoom over the plankton and planet of abundance. There is a submarine they fire up with the help of an electrical eel. This movie is full of positive energy.",1335916800,3,1309,4.574468085106383
4975688,3,B00683T51S,"I'm a movie buff. I have watched and seen about every kind of movie old or new there is. This movie is PG, and so I way predicted everything that would pretty much happen before it happen. I kind of liked the first movie, and so I gave this a shot. It's pretty much the same thing, but now there a extra love interest threw into the mix. It's not really exciting but NOT boring either. It just okay.

You don't need to watch the first movie to watch this movie. There's no back story to it at all. All there is that connect these two movie is the boy, Sean. He is in both movie, the end.

So, if you're looking for a family filled fun movie, this is it! Otherwise, you might get pretty bored with this one and you can pass on it.",1335225600,,729,3.9863013698630136

However, this movie is geared for a younger audience and I now wish I had brought my 3 year old!  Great family action/humor/adventure movie.  Can't wait until it's released!",1335139200,3,321,4.129032258064516
4975690,4,B00683T51S,"Juvenile action films should always have Dwayne Johnson (formerly The Rock) in the cast. He has an unmistakable charm that spoofs his image and seems enormously likable. This time he treats us to his dancing pecs (yes, you read that right!) and a ukulele-accompanied version of ""What a Wonderful World,"" but his focus is still kid-friendly family fare. No argument here! And Amazon.com has family fare!

To make an island this mysterious, Director Brad Peyton (""Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"") is once again using a LOT of Computer Generated Imaging. How else can we have puppy-sized elephants and honeybees big enough to ride?

We see:
  * Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids are All Right"") as our hero, off in quest of an island that seems to exist only in books: Jules Verne's Mysterious Island and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Robert Lewis Stevenson's Treasure Island. He decodes a message from his long-missing grandfather and thinks he might be stranded on an island doomed to soon disappear.
  * Dwayne Johnson (""Fast Five"") is our young hero's stepfather but his awkward attempt at a father-son talk is pretty pathetic. He agrees to take the boy on a trip to the South Pacific, but has no idea what the kid really has in mind.
  * Luis Guzmn (""The Caller"") owns a rickety old helicopter which they hire (chickens roosting in it are his ""security system""). He knows the danger, but really needs the money to send his daughter to college.
  * Michael Caine (""The Dark Knight"") is our hero's grandfather, isolated on that mysterious island for many years and more than a bit daft.
  * Vanessa Hudgens (""Beastly"") is here for set decoration and to provide a flimsy love interest for our hero.

Lame dialogue like ""Who's up for adventure?"" and calling three guys ""ladies"" is offered, along with 3-D images of centipedes skittering off rocks into our laps, cherries ricocheting off the pecs of Rock into our midst, and pieces of that helicopter as it disintegrates in a hurricane. The children in the audience weren't bored and I am, once again, impressed by Dwayne Johnson's career path. He is the most unlikely of PG-rated actors, yet he consistently entertains in these goofy things. Good for him.",1334275200,43,2212,4.835543766578249
