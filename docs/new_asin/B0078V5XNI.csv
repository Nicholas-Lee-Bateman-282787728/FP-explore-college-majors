8512397,5,B0078V5XNI,"I always wanted to try using a mandala to reach deeper and to learn more about myself and this video helped me break the ice! I've now done two mandalas which I still use to meditate on and learn new things about myself. I was surprised and how intimidating the whole process seemed at first and this video really helped me take the first step. It's amazing when you start sharing your mandala - If you're so inclined- to others, the layers they can read into your drawings! Thanks Kris for a great intro to mandalas and their uses!!!",1342396800,,534,4.404040404040404
8512398,5,B0078V5XNI,"This DVD was recommended to me by a close friend to better understand personal Mandala drawing, their meaning and how to do it.  I was left so inspired I sat down and drew my first one! Kristine delivers an intricate and ancient concept in an easy and engaging way.  If you have any curiosity about what Mandalas are, or how they work, watch this short DVD but be sure to have some colored pencils and a pad.  You will want to try it first hand!",1341964800,,445,4.211764705882353
