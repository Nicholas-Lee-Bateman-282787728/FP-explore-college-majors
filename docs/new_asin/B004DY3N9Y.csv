4334806,5,B004DY3N9Y,"I wondered, as I watched this, what the writer and director was up to when they used fairly realistic elements along with some very unrealistic elements that we know about the time period.  For instance, one of the reasons it's called the dark ages is because we know so little.  This is primarily because the clergy were the only ones who could write and create a written history.  It's known that the clergy abandoned their posts like..well...rats...when the plague hit their villages.  This is the reason why we mostly have estimates on how many people were killed.  This means that the knights and clergymen of the time period were far from the ""sterling"" god-fearing men we see pictured in the beginning of the film.

As the film progresses, it becomes obvious what the motivation is for depicting the characters in the way they are.  It's a bleak morality lesson on man's inhumanity to man. It's a great watch with at least one or two twists you won't expect.  5 star recommendation!",1298764800,2,989,4.742690058479532
4334807,5,B004DY3N9Y,"I just recently watched this movie through the pre-theatrical view on my X-Box 360. It was excellent. It's been a long time since a movie like this has come out. A good adventure movie with lots of action and lots of dialog. Every Knight in the group was His own character with their own personality, unlike a lot of movies where the supporting cast are basically a group of no names that are simply there to die. The premiss was excellent and the twist at the end was unexpected. This is definitely a history buff's dream (especially if your into that particular time period) and it is as believable as it was enjoyable. Good acting, good plot, good movie. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",1297814400,7,694,4.4296875
4334808,5,B004DY3N9Y,"Its 1348, do you know where your monks are?

The Black Death has decended and, at first, the world seems to be suffering and suffering alone. This leads one monk to question his beliefs, and leads him on a quest to help a group of men as they search for a secluded town. This eventually leads the monk to question just about everything, including a love he was not supposed to have and whether or not the Black Death is something that is  prodded along by faith or a lack therein.

Black Death seemed, at first, to be a period piece that would be something like Black Robe. not the content, just the type of movie. It had the clothing and the suffering down, and it had a lot of the pieces to the puzzle inside it. Basically you have a monk that is asking if faith is something that is really form fitting for him or not, and you have him willing to leave the peace of his home to find out. While I was not certain whether or not this would be a good thing, i was sure that it would be a decent movie. Then the movie gets better, and it is because of a piece of the puzzle you do not see coming.

While there is a lot more to the story it would be ruinous to say much more, I can add that the movie is indeed a bit different. From the addition of the walking Plague Doctors to the people you see punishing themselves, you have an eclectic landscape that seems to be well-drawn. You also have a group of men that are traversing the land in search of a town, and you start following and questioning why. The thing is that thinking you know is a bad thing because, plot-wise, this is a nice thing that leads you to have a little fun. Ther movie here gets different and interesting.

At first I would not have called it a horror movie. It seemed to be more of a comentary on the moment. At the end I would have called it something different, but horror still seems a little out there. It does have toture in there - not overdrawn but key to the moment - and it does have some oddities. It also have elements that you epect, only it does not stay that way. This makes it worth watching because it isn't what you think you are tuning into - a thing I like. And while I am avoiding ruining the movie, I will say this is a nice 4.5 that rounds into a 5 nicely, making it a key watch.

If you have heard of it, enjoy watching it beforehand. Thank you.",1297209600,5,2342,4.06941431670282
4334809,5,B004DY3N9Y,"Yes, it's a european film, so it is different. But in my opinion in a very good way. This is my favorite movie, it feels like you are really with them on their journey. Sean Bean is exceptional. Watch this if your tired of the same old, same old and are yearning for something different. and It really has nothing to do with the wicker man other than that there are witches in it. and well a spoiler.",1297036800,4,400,4.141025641025641
4334810,2,B004DY3N9Y,"....it's a much better, more suspenseful, and compelling tale.  Black Death doesn't have that ""grab you and keep you enthralled"" storytelling, and is poorly woven together, although in a few scenes there are delicious bits of irony that keep this movie from being a total waste of time.  Save your money - you'll be glad you did.",1296950400,6,329,4.754385964912281
4334811,3,B004DY3N9Y,"On the heels of Season of the Witch (as inaccurate a vision of this era as I have seen), Black Death manages to be everything that its predecessor  was not. A group of knights are traveling to a village which has reportedly not been impacted by the plague AT ALL, to determine whether or not it is ""protected"" by a necromancer. If so, they are to return same to the bishop who commissioned them for judgement and execution. Along the way, they pick up a young monk who knows the area to guide them, discover one of their men shows signs of having contracted the plague, and run afoul of thieves who are obviously robbing any and all travelers for whatever they can get. Ultimately, they reach their destination and discover that the rumors appear to be, in fact, quite true. What is unknown is the identity of the necromancer and how the few soldiers should proceed against so many villagers.

I won't reveal certain twists and I won't give away any more of the plot than I already have. What I will say is that this is one good ""tale"". The kind The Brothers Grimm would be impressed with; and that any who watch it would do well to remember that a really good tale is neither about leaving, arrival or SPECIAL EFFECTS, it is about the journey. How men are changed by their journeys and about how not all of those changes are honorable or even life-affirming.

The Black Death, The Little Ice Age and The Inquisition were known as the dark ages and there is a reason for that name. This is a movie that is dark, cold, bleak and disturbing... just as it should be.

It is also well shot, well acted, well scripted, costumed and lit. Furthermore, it does not pander to the audience nor assume that we are, or are not, historians. In the end; it's just a well put-together film, one that is well worth seeing.",1296864000,190,1806,4.414414414414415
4334812,5,B004DY3N9Y,"This movie really stuck with me days after I watched it. I can't imagine what it was like to live in Europe during the Black Death but it must have seemed like Hell on earth. I really enjoyed Eddie Redmayne in this as well as his acting in the excellent The Pillars of the Earth mini series. The cover may fool you into thinking there is a lot of action but the majority is on the story and the characters. However, the action was very brutal and realistic as I think it should be. The pace of the movie was done well and the overall atmosphere is very haunting. Do yourself a favor and watch it.",1291161600,112,596,4.146551724137931

4334827,5,B004DY3N9Y,"I originally watched this movie on Hoopla (an online streaming website for Public Library card owners) after it was recommended to me based on my love of historical/war/thriller movies. I read the synopsis for the movie and went in expecting a run-of-the-mill medieval action flick.

Black Death has action, don't get me wrong. I would have been satisfied just with that. Instead, I got so much more out of this movie than I expected. Black Death is an action movie, yes; however, it is also a fantastic character study of a man's descent into darkness due to trauma and worldly experiences. It is a study of the human psyche and how it is affected due to religion and the general ignorance of a population in 1348. It is a study of how two groups of people who have two very different sets of ideals can clash and live with (or not) one another. This movie has no hero and no antagonist, though you may feel it does going into it and experiencing the first half hour or so alone.

Do not look up spoilers for this movie before watching it. This is a fantastic, low budget movie that deserves much more attention than it received. I adored the movie so much after viewing it the first time, but didn't think it'd be worth another viewing. A few weeks later, and I couldn't get it out of my head; I had to experience a second viewing. I bought it and showed it to my husband, who also immensely enjoyed it, and we spent a good half hour afterwards talking about various philosophies and how they related to what we'd seen. Black Death is a dark, grim thriller and a good conversation piece, and I highly recommend it.",1484524800,2,1616,4.456081081081081
4334828,4,B004DY3N9Y,"3 1/2 stars... It's very rare to find films about the Black Death so I was eager to view this.  It did not disappoint much.  (Frankly, I'm surprised this subject hasn't been covered more extensively given that it shaved off about 25% of the Eurasian population in just one year - like the US losing 80 million people at once.)  The story concerns a novice monk who volunteers to help  a band of mercenaries investigate a village where, it is said, no one has died of plague.  (Oh, and, on the way, the monk can perhaps meet his lover.)  What follows is medieval - filth, disease, death, degeneracy, gruesome murder, rabid exhortations of faith - and the story flows along nicely for the most part with solid performances by Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne and Carice van Houten, who, if I'm not mistaken, manages to get through the film without exposing her breasts.  The theme is quite similar to ""The Wicker Man"", although the latter is substantially better.  The problem with ""Black Death"" is that it takes an acceptably slow time getting to the point but, once there, tackles it in an instant.  The climax doesn't quite make sense (plague isn't THAT contagious) and the rapid change the monk undergoes fails to add up.  Still, it is a decent movie and an admirable effort to convey the despair of the Black Death to a modern audience.",1484092800,,1332,4.629787234042553

This film really could be shrunken down into one TV episode. As someone who loves history, I expected to see more about the Black Death such as when it first reached villages, their reactions, families becoming torn apart, grave pits of bodies, 14th century silly remedies to cure the plague, the pope being surrounded by fire etc. I'd recommend watching it as a day filler but don't expect it to be the best damned movie you'll ever see.",1482969600,,575,4.592233009708738

4334903,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Overall really good film!

Previous reviews mentioned a lack of a story, but I think given the context and the setting, the story was very compelling. Lots of action and suspense kept the story moving with very beautiful cinematic elements. The fact that the characters motives are always 'suspect' makes for twists in the plot that are really dynamic, and ultimately leave you to second-guess which 'side' you are supporting.

The topic of the early Catholic church and inquisitions into heretical personalities definitely cast a dark shadow of fear and drama over Europe at the time, and as such the topic is handled really simply but with alot of raw energy. Not quite giving it a 'glamorous' perspective, and consequently also making the view second-guess the point of the protagonists on their mission. Regardless of the end message, the topic is addressed in a compelling way, and you as the viewer are left to imagine the era with renewed interest.

I felt like this film had traits reminiscent of the movie ""The New World"", in that the fear of the unknown was a major aspect in the daily lives of people at the time, and this movie portrays the seriousness of how religion and faith were judged (if wrongly at the time) as essential to existence.

The climax also leaves the viewer to question the result of the main character, and whether any actions justify violence & execution.",1477699200,5,1389,4.823529411764706

4334915,1,B004DY3N9Y,"A twisted sick story of the dark ages, this film can't make up it's mind whether it's condemning the stupidity, ignorance and homicidal viciousness of the christian church (well described and shown), or how those who are not believers are righteous on the outside, but just as sick on the inside. I suppose that in the end you are supposed to see how a good, pious man is turned by unbelievers into a vile, vengeful sword for the church... burning innocents at the stake (but really only because a non-believer made him do it).
If this film was meant to be anti-religious in it's outlook, it failed. If it meant to illustrate how the evil in the church wasn't the fault of believers (the devil made me do it excuse), that failed also. And the shocking twist in the story toward the end was telegraphed loudly by anyone with a brain. No surprise there.
All in all, it was a very confusing mish-mosh of what I might call superstitious, gory religious porn.
The only point of the film is that it had no point.",1477440000,,1006,4.4728260869565215

I felt terrible that the witch that lived in this marshland had drugged Osmand's girlfriend leading him to later kill her thinking she was still a dead spirit.  Osmand's faith was later challenged after he found out that his girlfriend was not dead but drugged, buried and made to look like the witch had raised her from the dead.

 In saying that the Game of Thrones pair of Sean Bean and the absolutely gorgeous Carice van Houten were excellent especially Carice who if she told me to throw myself off a cliff for her I would go over with a smile on my face. Eddie Redmayne was quite good as Osmund too.

4335045,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Scarcely seen in the United States and released on home video to little fanfare, Black Death is one of those underrated films that for whatever reason never amounts to more than a tiny blip on the radar of the movie world, but whose merits offer a rewarding experience to those who do find it. In many ways Black Death is an alternate take on the same story told in Season of the Witch, the Nicolas Cage feature released earlier this year. Like that film, Black Death's story takes place in the Middle Ages amidst the ravages of the bubonic plague. And as with Season of the Witch, the greatest terrors encountered in Black Death lurk within the human heart.

As the ruthless plague kills indiscriminately outside the walls of his monasteryand sometimes within it as wellthe young monk Osmund finds his faith wavering. Torn between his unyielding vows to God and his love for the lovely Averill, Osmund prays fervently for a sign. When a knight arrives as the monastery's doorstep in search of a guide into unknown territory, Osmund believes his prayer has been answered. Ulrich, the bishop's personal envoy, is leading his men in search of a village where the plague supposedly does not afflict. It is said the village is home to witches and devils, and Ulrich is determined to find the truth. Osmund, against the wishes of his abbot, agrees to lead Ulrich to what he seeks, fearing that whatever the young man finds out there waiting for him, it will change him forever. But Osmund is desperate to discover his destiny, no matter the price. And so begins a journey deep into a dark, blighted wilderness, where superstition and religion mingle in benighted forests and the line between faith and madness blends seamlessly together.

Black Death is thoughtfully written, carefully directed, and realistically performed. There is some action, and likewise a few scenes of torture and not a few moments of white-knuckle suspense, but unlike Season of the Witch it is not really an action film. Black Death's delicately unfolding plot mines several rich, dark veins of human thought, particularly the nature of humanity and how we as fragile, and very sinful, individuals live out the ideals of our religion in a world of chaos and inexplicable suffering. The eternal struggle between Christianity and paganism is played out in an artful, uncompromising little epic that is as terrifying as it is heartbreaking, as is the undying war within the human heart between good and evil. Directed by Christopher Smith and starring stalwart veteran actor Sean Bean as the crusading Ulrich, Eddie Redmayne as the confused Osmund and Carice van Houten as a woman who may be the worst sort of witch, Black Death is a startlingly effective film on all counts. Unlike Season of the Witch, Black Death leaves many questions unanswered, and the plot is nothing if not ambiguous. But it is the thoughtfulness of its mysterious story, and that which it inspires in the viewer, that makes it such an excellent film.",1438128000,2,2993,4.87819253438114

A shame because it had promise. Acting is solid, visuals and tone are good.

The violence is overdone and adds next to nothing to the plot. It had a desperate feel, as if the director was trying  to distract the audience from  the gaping plot holes.

4335056,4,B004DY3N9Y,"This little film presents a view of the Middle Ages that manages to eclipse the most horrific moments of Game of Thrones.  What are the ingredients?

1.  Set it in the time of bubonic plague ... a time of almost unbelievable death and horror that had many people unfortunate enough to live through it convinced they were seeing the Apocalypse.

2.  Have as the protagonists a group of men absolutely convinced that they are doing God's work (something that has so often been the cause of evil throughout history).

3.  Have them confront a group of pagans who initially come across as the medieval equivalent of flower children but very soon are revealed to be monsters in human form.  I really give kudos to the film makers for not making the Christians in the story the exclusive villains.

4.  Throw in an incredible amount of violence with a boatload of killing...which includes an incredibly graphic death for Sean Bean.

5.  Add to the mix, the fine acting talents of Carice Van Houten (who seems to have a talent for playing pitiless fanatics professing a ""new creed"" first here and then in Game of Thrones).

Bottom line:  what you've got here is an almost unrelentingly grim horror story about a clash between fanatics that made me think of Henry Kissenger's statement about the Iran-Iraq War (""it's a shame they both can't lose."").",1435881600,,1341,4.748917748917749

4335133,3,B004DY3N9Y,"Just a friendly warning - this movie might be more violent than you're expecting. It certainly was for me. That's not to say it's a bad movie. Given the subject matter, the violence made sense and was even appropriate. It was just horrific and shocking in a 'cringe, cover my eyes and fight back the nausea' kind of way.

The producers of Black Death took the brutal, ugly side of the middle ages and ran with it. A group of soldiers representing the church seek out an isolated village that has been untouched by the plague, believing a necromancer and/or evil witchcraft must be responsible because everywhere else has been decimated by the ""pestilence."" The look and feel of the movie certainly seems authentic, but unfortunately that authenticity doesn't stop at thatched cottages and rotting teeth. It also includes scenes of a man being crucified & gutted, and another being drawn & quartered. I'm not condemning the movie based on the level of brutality. I'm just saying I was caught off guard by HOW violent it was, and even though I understood WHY this movie was so disturbing it didn't make it any easier to watch. This movie immerses you in the terror and violence caused by a disease that couldn't be understood or stopped. It doesn't make excuses for itself and it doesn't apologize for a dark ending. Take the title ""Black Death"" literally - the producers certainly did.

But like I said - I didn't necessarily think this was a bad movie. I actually found the religious debate and various reactions to the plague really interesting from a historical perspective. Just know that this isn't a ""Pillars of the Earth"" kind of medieval movie. It's also not a ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy-type movie, or a ""Gladiator"" or ""Braveheart"" kind of action movie. I would describe this movie more like a gritty and gruesome documentary - the kind that makes you hunker down on the couch and thank your lucky stars you live in time that has soap and antibiotics.

It's worth seeing - just maybe don't eat dinner beforehand.",1422921600,,2021,4.735795454545454

Very dark, depressing even, but it definitely will stay with you after you finish watching it. As a period piece, it is fantastic, and really captures the feel of the times of the black plague. Its themes are faith and morality, and it works those themes expertly. I actually found it faith-affirming, although in the darkest way possible, if that makes any sense. The movie is about men who do ""the work of God"" but they're hardly cast in a favorable light. But, spoilers, their faith is strong, it does not waver in adversity. For good or bad.

This movie is not for those with weak constitutions. There are scenes of graphic violence, sickness and torture. It is not for anyone who wants a feel-good movie.

4335209,4,B004DY3N9Y,"We often take revisionist stances on history. We like not to think about what was done in the name of our people and our gods during the course of history, but those things happened. They happened all the time. We did not even have a word for ""genocide"" until after World War II. Wiping out entire villages that had on the wrong hat, or bowed to the wrong altar was commonplace. This movie is clever in pointing out that all sides did this, not just ours, but that it was wrong for all. The movie also does an excellent job of pointing out that the worst villains kill from an emotional well that often mingles with love and understanding. It's a small spoiler to say that this movie creates a better Darth Vader than all of the Star Wars prequels combined. The movie does not have an uplifting ending, but an uplifting ending would have been a ridiculous, revisionist lie that spits in the face of the pile of bodies beneath out collective feet. We must look back at our history, at ourselves, and wonder why we had to do things the way we did, and the more troubling notion that maybe, at that time, there were few alternatives. Those who dislike the ending must ask whether it's the ending they do not like, or the last several millennia of human interaction. It can hardly be said that the movie somehow lied to us, it's one of the few movies I have ever known that accurately portrayed all sides while not insulting us with easy answers or simple endings.

For anyone who is susceptible to motion sickness, this film cannot be viewed in one sitting.

The battle scenes are particularly difficult to watch. The hand-cam jumps around so much, they are not worth watching.

Some film-makers are constrained by budgets, so they go with hand-held cams and wing it hoping for a salable result.

Some films that use hand-held cams are very well done, e.g., the Matt Damon Bourne films. However, this is not one of them.

4335250,4,B004DY3N9Y,"England, 1348: The country is reeling from the plague, but one village surrounded by foggy marshlands remains mysteriously untouched. Some monks at a nearby monastery, along with some knights and soldiers, are convinced that this immunity must be due to the Devil, witches, and necromancers. Led by knight Ulric (Sean Bean), with young monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) as a guide, a small band of soldiers journeys to the village to battle Satan.

As you can probably surmise from the premise and cover, BLACK DEATH is a very bleak, violent, and gory film. Still, it's nowhere near as schlocky as I thought it might be, and the time setting is captured quite authentically. The makers of this film did an admirable job considering the low budget they were working with. BLACK DEATH's plot follows a solid, original, but fairly predictable path: There aren't a lot of huge surprises, but there are a number of nicely done minor twists. Though it's not exactly Middle English (for which we'd need subtitles), the script is also pretty decent. Careful but spontaneous acting: Carice van Houten is a standout as Langiva, the village enchantress, witch, or whatever one chooses to label her. The fact that she's a real hottie also helps. The pretty natural scenery--set in England but filmed in Germany--provides an effective contrast to all the human horrors here. Finally, BLACK DEATH's religious themes--open to interpretation as pro-Christian, anti-Christian, neither, or both--do a great deal to distinguish it. As I see it, it shows both sides of the religious coin, with just the right amount of vagary.

While it didn't absolutely floor me, BLACK DEATH was still a pleasant surprise.

4335251,4,B004DY3N9Y,"I have been a fan of Sean Bean since his appearance in Lord of the Rings.  I liked him in National Treasure, Troy, and Silent Hill.  I had never heard of anyone else in the movie with the exception of David Warner but the trailer looked good, so I took a chance.

I was not disappointed!

The overall ""feel"" of the movie is excellent -- even with the couple of mistakes in the details.  They do not take away from the flavor of setting.  The sense of desperation is palpable and the tension is real.  Without giving away the twist, I will say the ending is satisfying and explains the questions you may have.

Having said all that, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the director chose to use the ""shaky camera"" technique.  I believe this is to make the viewer feel more a part of the action but he overuses it in my opinion and I found it more annoying than anything.  It is not in use the entire time, so do not that put you off.

The methods were extreme in how they dealt with the objects of their pursuit.  Their strong beliefs are at the heart of the punishment they inflict on those they feel are deserving.. The few true believers are willing to endure indescribable pain and torture, and in some cases, even death to defend their faith. But as I stated, it is not always crystal clear who is deserving of their wrath.

The subject was quite interesting, as the common blame for bubonic plague was witches and necromancers at that time. The movie didn't try to allay those fears, in fact sort of promoted them. Now we knew it was rat borne fleas but it was not until recent times we ruled out the punishment of god for our sins as a major factor. Redwayne playing a flawed novice priest was a very good use of his talents and Bean's leader of the Bishop's investigatory force was apt for him.

Black Death From a medieval person's point of view, they didn't know much about biology. When entire villages were wiped out by a mysterious, nasty disease, they thought it was either caused by witches or by an angry God. They flailed around trying to do something - anything - to get it to end.

Into this mix comes a group of religious men. Osmund is a quiet monk who is torn by his love for a woman. He wants her to get somewhere safe from the plague. Ulric is a knight who's on a quest to examine a village which apparently is safe from the plague. Along with them go various other miscreants.

The movie keeps you guessing. Are there supernatural elements? Is what they are seeing real? This is useful because it helps the viewer get into the mindset of medieval people. From their point of view, some elements of human biology *were* supernatural. I wasn't that fond of the ending, as I find it doesn't add to the story, but I'm sure others might find it fitting.

They did a good job on the historical side. Not perfect, but then again most movies are far worse. The plague years were gritty, run down, rough, and full of intense emotion. People had no idea what to do. It seemed as if the world were about to end. The clothing and architecture is fairly accurate. So many movies make the middle ages seem like a eat-off-the-floor-clean wonderland. It wasn't. Especially not these years.

Interestingly, for Game of Throne fans, both Sean Bean (Eddard Stark) and Carice van Houten (Melisandre) play key characters in this movie.

Well recommended.",1391558400,,1751,4.596153846153846

The movie is definitely dark and sobering but quite thought provoking.  I went into this movie knowing full well that the side of faith would most likely be shown in a fanatical light.  I was very surprised to see that the pagan was also shown to be a bit fanatical as well.  This brought a good balance to the movie for me and I wasn't really sure which side was good and which was evil - until the climax came and then I knew without a doubt.

Be warned.  This not a movie for the faint of heart.  There is quite a bit of gore involved.  The times were violent and the church was on one of her many ""convert'em or kill'em"" crusades, times I've considered to be the saddest in the history of my faith.  The movie does, however, show how even the most spiritual of men can be pushed beyond their endurance so that they crack under the pressure and become something they might not normally have been otherwise.",1390867200,,1057,4.218905472636816

4335343,5,B004DY3N9Y,"I purchased this at a Wal-Mart on a whim after seeing the cover.

It was an interesting film. I thought it was trying to deliver a message that religions were like plagues, and best to be avoided by isolation. There was a strong anti Catholic feeling in it, much like Ridley Scotts film. The attempt to display how pain or the threat of can change anyones belief was interesting, but wouldnt support the Warrior Monks sacrifice at Hattin in 1187.

The story takes place after the demise of the Templar Order, and the lead character sports items hinting hes a member of a powerful Order (Hospitaller) as attested by the difference of the Abby to his presence.

During this time, under Pope Gregory XI, Hospitallers and Dominicans were used to promote the inquisitorial pursuit of heretics in Europe. (see: The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571: The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries By Kenneth Meyer Setton, or Gregory XI bio)

So maybe he was..all I know is, if my horse were stolen, thered be a lot of local villages pretending to be large piles of kindling!
The young monk follows the reverse route of experience than Brother Cadfael. It was asking too much of him to make those vows, and the enemy plays on that fact. On the other hand you have Brother Ulrichs character; hardened by lifes events, and he chooses a path much like some of the historical Warrior Monks did. (Loss of family, a chance to exercise your skills/trade in the pursuit of an idea larger than ones self)

Some of the events led me to say that if you make an example in a harsh way with someone, you quiet possibly harden the resolve of those you're trying to win over. (See the Knights in the cage, or the young monk, who ended up displaying just this line of thinking)

It was a No Brainer that theyd kill any knight who turned faiths, because to set him free, was to risk retaliation when he returned with a larger army. It was also to prove to the young monk, that even the strongest would break, to save their skins, and that faith had no deep found roots.

Seeing the young monk give up the cloth, so to speak, and live a life of violence is not exactly the same as what Ulrich did. Ulrich was a trained soldier from the beginning, plying his skills in the cause of the faith. The monk/turned warrior, learned violence to exact revenge for what occurred years before. Although in pursuit of the aims of the Church, his was motivated by revenge, and not piety.

All in all I liked the movie.",1386028800,,2472,4.502232142857143
4335344,5,B004DY3N9Y,"Absolutely epic film. I found the Blu-Ray in the $7 bin at Walmart and thought I'd give it a try. It was worth every penny.

Amazingly accurate in its portrayal of 1300s Europe, Black Death is a story with many facets, and will leave the watcher(s) with many thoughts even after the second or third viewing. The characters are believable, the action is gritty, and the tension is palpable. I especially loved the fact that although the film garnered an R rating, there is literally no smutzy sexual scenes and very little profanity.

As a Christian myself, I definitely enjoyed the look into the various aspects of the faith at that time in history: the militaristic Crusader, exemplified in Sean Bean's character; the hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic church; and the more modern Protestant tendencies of the young monk. However, I do know some scenes that would disturb some more conservative Christians than myself, so this film is probably not for everyone.

Even the portrayal of witchcraft was tasteful in that it leaves the entire thing in a very vague cloud where you aren't sure whether it truly is sorcery or just coincidence. It really forces the viewer to get involved with the story and make judgements on their view of the events.

To be sure, this is a movie that I will be returning to for years to come, if only to puzzle out all the little nuances of the characters and beliefs...",1385856000,,1396,4.709016393442623

Background info on the production indicates that indeed some compromises and last moment changes were made to the story and it feels that way.  This could have been either much more twisted and eerie without any particular moral stance, or much more convincingly played as a clash of two belief systems, but in the end the opportunity was lost to some hamfisted and rather trite choices.

Still, a very good looking movie and quite enjoyable to watch, enough so that I initially gave it four stars just because it looks so damned good.  I was hoping for another story equal to The Name of the Rose and ended up with a 1960s Hammer Films type of melodrama - lush, lovely, moody and a bit hokey and trite.",1384387200,,906,4.708860759493671

4335361,5,B004DY3N9Y,"Wow! In case you missed that first part it was...Wow! For most of the first part of this movie you are in relatively familiar territory. You have the Plaugue and the good guys have to make a journey to try and make things right etc.., but then things take a sharp Left! The second half of this movie has that gritty realistic vibe similar to many films of the 70's. It is creepy and I mean the real deal, genuinely creepy. The idea that evil will present itself with a benevolent face is nothing new, but it is done here in a spectacular way.  All I can say is while you are watching the first part of this movie it's good, but be patient because you're in for a real treat the second half. I was especially pleased with the defense of God and the Knights faith. Christianity is often portrayed in such a poor, weak, light, so it was refereshing to see people champion God in a meaningful way. Reminds me of Foxes Book of Martyrs. If you have never read this book, it is a powerful read. It gives actual accounts of Christians tortured for their faith during pre/post medieval times and is very inspiring. In one account a man is being burned at the stake and his legs and arms are gone. The ropes holding his head and torso to the stake burn away and he rolls onto the ground away from the fire. His accusers take a pitch fork and fling what is left of his body back onto the fire. While flying to the air with no arms and legs he can be heard singing and praising God! Not for the meek or faint of heart!

A lot of fighting, a lot of blood and guts. A lot of ""I am going to impose my beliefs upon you."" The Xtians dish it out and they get a good dose of it.

Taking a young monk and opening his eyes to true harsh realities, to pain, to death, to challenge his faith in ways he could never have imagined and the effect on him.

The film shows fairly realistically without falling into gratuitous violence how women were treated when thought to be a ""witch"".  Of course there is a biased and imho unrealistic, misogynistic and somewhat heavy handed ""pro"" Christian message in the way women and a woman in particular was characterized and used.  My view differs from those who say there is an anti-Christian view near the end.  I see it as anti-woman, prejudiced and narrow-minded toward the Christian mindset for the time.

Luckily, ""witches"" aren't burnt anymore, but in many cases we are also not well tolerated and face judgment by those who claim to be Christian (judge not, lest ye be judged).

That said, the 3rd act is so gruesome and nihilistic that I couldn't even sleep, and I'm generally on the dark side in terms of taste.  The writers are Christopher Hitchens level atheists and, without giving anything away, there is no redemption here.

The Christians (remember that at the time of the story (mid 14th Century) the church hadn't yet split into Catholic and Protestant) are portrayed as bad or worse than the witches and necromancers they are hunting, and if a meteorite had destroyed the planet in the last five minutes of this film it would have been greeted with a sigh of relief from the theatre audience.

The cast is quite good, the kid (the monk, Osmund) who played the boyfriend Jean Valjean rescues in Les Miz is terrific (forgive me not knowing his name) and Sean Bean is terrific as almost always. The sorceress was cast (I think) to remind of the young Helen Mirren from John Boorman's King Arthur movie (which Nicol Williamson as Merlin stole,  with one of the all time great performances) but to me she didn't really look period and it looked in some scenes like she was wearing a chic cashmere cardigan, not really period).

Recommended, but only for those with a very strong stomach, if you are Christian you may have a very hard time with the ending.

Black Death is a good honest try at putting the horror of those times onto film, so I rate it four stars.

4335402,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Black Death (Christopher Smith, 2010)

Christopher Smith, over the years, has gotten very, very good at one particular thing: taking ideas that were played out years ago and remaking them with clever, funny twists to come up with surprisingly watchable movies. The best thing about such a specialization is that it's highly portable; you can apply it to pretty much any genre and come up with a winner. Here, he tackles the historical-drama-with-a-subgenre-of-Inquisition, which has been played out approximately since Cecil B. DeMille was a pup, and once again comes up with something quite nice. It does lack the humor of Smith's earlier films, but I've gotta say, I was okay with that. (And I did not expect to be.)

If you need any further convincing, well, have a look at the cast list. The abbot (David Warner. I mean, DAVID WARNER.) of a German monastery hires a band of mercenaries headed up by the amoral, violent Ulrich (Sean Bean... the list of people here who will need no introduction is just gonna keep going, folks) to investigate a town located in the center of a nearby swamp that seems to be immune from the Black Plague. Ulrich, who doesn't really believe in divine providence and Satanic protection from disease and all that sort of thing, opines that, perhaps, marsh gas is providing a natural air filter that keeps out the bug, but the abbot is having none of that. A young monk, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), offers to guide the band through the swamp, partially to get out and get some experience on the road, but partially because his betrothed, Averill (Angus, Thongs, and Perfect Snogging's Kimberley Nixon), has fled the city because of the plague and is currently hiding in the village where the party is bound...or so he hopes, having had no word from her. Once they get there, and the trip is fraught with all sorts of dangers, they find the wild animals and bandits in the woods are nothing compared to Langiva (Carice van Houtenand she was cast only after both Famke Janssen and Lena Headey had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts!), the suspected witch trafficking with the devil to keep the plague out of the village, who happens to be mind-meltingly hot, and pretty durned good with herbs besides (as soon as the group gets into town, she takes Osmund, wounded in the side during a battle, and fixes him up but good with poultices and bandages). While the main plot plays out about the way you'd expect it to, we get a very interesting subplot here: is Osmund going to hold fast to Mother Church, or will Langiva's kindness and good deeds usher in Osmund's own personal Age of Reason?

Oh, and did I mention that Ulrich's band of merry men contains Emun Elliott (Prometheus), Johnny Harris (Atonement), Smith regular Andy Nyman (The Brothers Bloom), Tygo Gernant (Godforsaken), and John Lynch (In the Name of the Father)? This movie is not hurting for starpower one bitthat's one of the little bits of magic that Christopher Smith regularly brings to his moviesand talent will out just as much as truth will. You could put a merely competent director in a movie with this much talent in it at the helm and it would be worth watching; someone like Smith can take this crew and guarantee you a good time. It's ugly, it's angry, it's compelling and somehow surprisingly tender. If you've not yet discovered Christopher Smith, this is as good a place as any to begin. *** ",1361145600,,3407,4.730639730639731

Really dark and creepy well directed and acted this movie was not only a pleasant surprise but one of my favorites of 2010. Great performances by Sean Bean, Carice van Houten and Eddie Redmayne.

4335409,5,B004DY3N9Y,"I have to start out with a confession: I avoided this movie as if it carried the plague itself. To me, it looked fairly generic and when I had checked it out previously, it was described as a historical adventure mystery horror film. Such a description failed to pique my interest.
Convinced by one of my oldest and dearest friends to give the film a chance, I settled down to watch 2010's Black Death, a film directed by Christopher Smith (Creep, Severance) and starring Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings, Silent Hill), Eddie Redmayne (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Good Shepherd) and Carice van Houten (Repo Men, Valkyrie).

The DVD cover offered the following synopsis:
""The year is 1348. Europe has fallen under the shadow of the Black Death. As the plague decimates all in its path, fear and superstition are rife. There are rumors of a village hidden in marshland that the plague cannot reach. There is talk of a necromancer who leads the village and is able to bring the dead back to life. Ulric (Sean Bean), a fearsome knight, is charged by the church to investigate these rumors. Joined by a young monk and a small consort of soldiers, the journey ahead will lead them into the heart of darkness where faith is challenged and put to the ultimate test.""

I have to open with admitting that I was impressed by this film. Within minutes, I was reminded of a number of films such as: The Name of the Rose, Witchfinder General, Roger Corman's The Pit and The Pendulum and The Masque of the Red Death; and much of the movie had the feel of an old school Hammer production. Top marks from me so far...

However, proceedings for a significant portion of the movie were very much in the vein of a dark action/adventure. Much is made of the plague sweeping across the country and the viewer is treated to the execution of a ""witch"" and the summary despatching of one of the soldiers sent to investigate the mysterious village. It is only when the band arrive at the village that this film ventures into solid horror country.

Speaking of the country, Black Death was filmed in Germany and much of the proceedings took place outdoors, lending a much needed element of reality to a movie that would have suffered greatly had it been filmed on a studio lot.

Given that the film is set about 650 years ago, some of the messages conveyed are still as relevant then as they are now, such as what people are prepared to do in the name of religion.

I don't want to spoil the film for any potential viewer but this film is worthy of inclusion in the horror genre. There's bloody violence, executions, crucifixions, dismemberment, pagan/ satanic worship and resurrection of the dead. The film has been criticised for its depiction of torture methods but in my opinion, it doesn't exactly venture into torture-porn; but I think it's fair to say that gorehounds will appreciate Black Death!
Despite these brutal aspects, the plot of Black Death is far from neglected and is in fact compelling; and the characters are convincingly portrayed by those already mentioned and ably supported by experienced performers such as: Tim McInnerny (Severance, Rogue Trader), John Lynch (Moll Flanders, In the Name of the Father), Johnny Harris (RocknRolla, Dorian Gray); and there's also a nice turn from veteran actor David Warner (Straw Dogs, The Omen, Time Bandits).

Christopher Smith has conjured up a suitably dour atmosphere for Black Death; created a cast of characters devoid of any real heroes or ""good guys""; and topped it off with a suitably sombre, bleak and barbaric ending making Black Death a solid entry to the genre but family entertainment it ain't!",1355616000,2,3636,4.725552050473186
4335410,5,B004DY3N9Y,This is a film about the dangers of religion whether it is Christianity or paganism. A Christian man murders the women he loves because he believes she is a reanimated corpse. A woman fools a tribe into believing she is a God because she knows herbalism. The pagans and the Christians proceed to try to tear each other limb from limb but meanwhile the bubonic plague burns in the background turning lymph nodes into baseball sized abcesses that rupture in massive explosions of pus. This is NOT a cheery film but it is a great illustration of fact that fear turns people into monsters.,1355184000,3,585,4.634615384615385

4335412,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Kinda funny that such a long and really harsh part of our history is basically just a recollection at this point.

But Black Death tells the story well. Native Americans say that stories are medicine and have healing power. Very true, I think here in this movie as well. The chapter of people dying horrific deaths for God, was so long and brutal, it's hard to encapsulate that into a movie, but that's what happened here.

Pros and cons are thus. The main character has got to stop being typecast into that medieval knight. It is officially irritating. But of course, he does it well. So, didn't let it bother me too much. Aside from that, not much was done clinically wrong in any way. So on with the story!

Spoiler alert.

The figure of the monk becoming a warrior for God is not so hard to understand. Insanity need not even play a role, which was the major accomplishment of Black Death. I had a hunch that the woman/witch had drugged the girl, it was kinda logical. And playing with his mind was the key, that was the brilliant part. It is nothing more than charlatans from all ages of old have done. Convince lesser minds of anything using some tried and true old magic tricks. And then of course, a Bishop sending out a small tactical team to find heathens and torture them to death is just part of the fun of ruling idiots.

Collectively, it seems that we almost have the exact same thing happening right now, in that, in the far, more comfortable future, they will look on us equally bemused!

For several hundred years, the Church massacred, assassinated, tortured and burned anything in its way. The message was clear, confess, live honestly and poorly, respect authority and pay your taxes. Black Death gives us a nugget of that history. Tree people who live in lush mountain lands and have access to medicines and ""potions"" - fresh water, it makes sense that a group may renounce God and live a Pagan life. Even to this extreme, believing that a woman amongst them can raise the dead.

It makes sense that a disease spread mostly by rats would spare these mountain, tree people. Don't forget that cats saved us from it in the end. Save a cat, I say.

In the end, this was well done. It takes a slice of our history and serves it up, cold, for our enjoyment. It probably happened, thousands of times.",1351987200,2,2314,4.492857142857143
4335413,3,B004DY3N9Y,"Sean Bean plays his character as if he were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ned-Stark/dp/B008CLI4N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ned Stark</a>'s twin-brother: the religious maniac. He surrounds himself with a posse of psychopaths, and together they romp through 14th Century England killing and maiming the insufficiently churched. This is the period  of the Black Death, which adds atmosphere as well as the title. The opening scenes feature a panorama of decaying corpses and scurrying rats. Corpses are a running theme throughout the movie.

There is still one village that is as yet untouched by the plague. Apparently this is due to witchcraft. The protagonist, a young novice, volunteers to guide Bean and his Merry Men to the village, where they plan on capturing the village chief and embarking on the usual rape, pillage, and so forth. The twist is that the village is more than ready for them when they arrive. Without spoiling too much, its as if the gang had been transported through time and space to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summerisle/dp/B00005KHJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summerisle</a>.  I'll leave it at that.

It's a well-done movie. The atmosphere of a countryside bewildered by, and under siege from the plague, is palpable. It's a bit like The Seventh Seal in that regard. Bean is quite believable as a inwardly tortured but outwardly fanatical heresy-hunter. (I did, however, fully expect him to announce ""winter is coming"". I couldn't shake Game of Thrones.)

Unfortunately, as others have noted, the rest of the characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The guileless adolescent novice remains a guileless adolescent novice, even with the forced twist at the movies end. That is my second criticism. Cinematically speaking, the twist at the end of the film doesn't add much to the experience of the film. The kid turns out to be a witless schmuck, just like the rest of 14th Century society. I suppose that the coda's saving grace is it denies Eddie Redmayne any claim to heroism...which, I guess, is kind of the point of the film.

When visited by something as horrific as the black death, no amount of flailing will suffice. Chances are you're not getting out alive.

There is a fair amount of arterial spray in the film. Not something for the squeamish, but then I doubt the squeamish would acquire something called ""The Black Death"". For the rest of us, it's nothing we haven't seen before.

The film was shot with a very Hollywood feel, and Bean and Eddie Redmayne are a stellar duo--both have A-list acting chops, and I hope the latter's career continues to take off.

I believe I have it figured out and will share evidence at the end of this review.

THE PLOT: The year is 1348 and England is plagued by the Black Death. The Roman Church learns of a remote village that has eluded the plague and suspect sorcery. They send their knight Ulrich (Sean Bean) and a team of hardened soldiers to investigate. On the way they enlist a young monk to lead them to the village, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), but he has ulterior motives in taking the assignment: He hopes to reunite with Averill, a girl who took sanctuary in the monastery but recently left due to the plague. The monk and the soldiers are all professing believers, but will their faith withstand the ultimate testing?

The film has high production values and was shot in NE Germany.

The story pulls you in before the first act is over. But it's the final act where the film's greatness really emerges. This part of ""Black Death"" took me by surprise and reveals that it's not really a film about the Black Death, at least not literally. The era of the bubonic plague is just a stage for a grueling exploration into personal belief in God, whether true faith or false.

Two important characters are introduced in the second half: Hob (Tim McInnerny) and the beautiful Langiva (Carice van Houten), the authorities of the village. Carice is exceptional.

A couple sequences show true cinematic excellence: A scene where Langiva leads Osmund out into the night marsh for an amazing revelation, and later when Osmund searches through the misty reeds while Langiva conveys the awful truth.

The lengthy water-pit sequence also stands out just for being so excruciating and is on par with the initial Russian roulette sequence in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deer-Hunter/dp/0783225997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deer Hunter</a>"" but with more meaning since the outcome in ""Black Death"" hinges on the victims' faith or lack of faith and the everlasting outcome. If Christianity is true, those who denounce their faith have nothing but eternal black death to look forward to.

""Black Death"" is reminiscent of films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Witchfinder-General/dp/B000RO9PUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Witchfinder General</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wicker-Man/dp/B000FUF6QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wicker Man</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Valley/dp/B0001GF2GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Valley</a>"" and maybe ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ravenous/dp/B0009X75J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ravenous</a>."" ""Black Death"" is as good or better.

GRADE: A

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

MY EXPLANATION:

Osmund was never a believer. He may have had some positive qualities but he simply wasn't a believer and the clues are there from the very beginning: For one, he was fornicating with his girlfriend and jumped on the first excuse to leave the monastery so he could see her again (using prayer and a ""sign from God"" as a cover - even a cover for his own delusion). In fact, Averill told him, ""You've ALREADY betrayed God."" Secondly, Dalywag points out that his purpose as a torturer was to sniff out lies and tells Osmund to his face that he's a lie. Speaking of Dalywag, despite his gruff exterior and occupation, he later proves his genuine faith as the first person to be crucified for it. Thirdly, Langiva (the red witch) said she looked into the eyes of each visitor when they arrived and saw that Osmund was the only one who wasn't out to harm them, meaning she pegged the others as believers, but not Osmund. Remember, the ""eyes are the windows of the soul."" Fourthly, although Osmund didn't vocalize his denouncement of God he readily got out of the water pit to view his girlfriend in the cottage. Fourthly, Osmund openly disagreed with Ulrich and the soldiers about Langiva and the villagers. Why? Because he was actually one of them, an unbeliever, whether he knew it or not. And lastly, the end plainly shows what became of Osmund: He became a lifeless and bitter false accuser who cruelly tortured and slew in the name of the church. Remember, Jesus said you can recognize false prophets by their fruits (Matthew 7:15-23).

Some object to Osmund being a fake believer on the grounds that he was a monk and lived in a monastery, not to mention he prayed. But these things don't make you a believer any more than being in a garage makes you a vehicle. True belief is a matter of the heart, not putting on airs of religiosity, like the Pharisees whom Jesus denounced as fakes.

The very first sign that Osmund wasn't a true believer was his seduction by Averill's beauty and his subsequent unrepentant spirit. At the end of the film when Hob is apprehended and caged he's asked why he follows the red witch and he replies, ""Because she's beautiful."" Hence, both Hob and Osmund were alike in that they renounced faith due to the seduction of beauty.

Although depicted as brutal witch-hunters, Ulrich and his team were RIGHT regarding their suspicions of the marsh village - the people HAD renounced God and witchcraft WAS being practiced, albeit in a partially charlatan form. Of course it's wrong to persecute people simply because they don't believe in God or adhere to pagan beliefs, but this was a different time and place, when the Anglican Roman Church was the state religion.

Although Swire proved to be a fake believer and is actually an obvious type of Judas, Ulrich, Wolfstan, Dalywag and the other surviving soldiers proved their genuine faith and escaped the ""black death"" of eternal death.

The idea that Osmund was the protagonist is a red herring. Ulrich and Wolfstan - gruff and flawed as they are - are the true protagonists of ""Black Death."" Besides his courageousness in the face of martyrdom, Ulrich cries out to the villagers in no uncertain terms, ""Repent before it's too late - Repent!""",1349222400,2,6322,5.337688442211055

4335423,4,B004DY3N9Y,"There have been many reviews of this film already, and quite a large number of them have tended to drop heavy hints about the story (not to say spoilers). Accordingly, I will limit myself to a few comments and try to explain why I liked this film so much more than I had expected to.

The first point is that my expectations have been rather low, and perhaps too low, just as it seems to have been the case for a number of other reviewers on Amazon sites. It is obviously always somewhat preferable to experience a ""nice"" rather than an ""unpleasant"" surprise, and this tends to influence the rating that a reviewer might deliver. I, like many others, have had a rather ""nice"" surprise when watching this film made on a relatively small budget by a director that I had never heard about before. I would have gone for the film anyway, as I tend to do with all ""historical"" films where the action is supposed to take place either during Antiquity or during the Middle Ages. To tell the truth, I was expecting an action romp with a lot of fighting, possibly quite a bit of gore, a second rate scenario, and a bunch of second rate actors. While this film is not a masterpiece, I nevertheless got something different and much better than what I was expecting.

Second, there was a real plot, set in 1348 as the Black Plague (or Black Death, hence the film's title) is sweeping across the British Isles after having ravaged Europe. These rather extraordinary circumstances, and the extremes to which people are lead to as a result, are superbly rendered at the beginning of the film. So you get the mass burials were the victims of the plague can hardly be buried fast enough before yet another load of carts full of bodies comes along. You also get the population of a village turning on however in their community happens to be different from them, whatever may be meant by ""different"", as they blame them for having somehow caused the disease (sorcery and witchcraft being the reason, of course). You also get a whole bunch of half crazed flagellants that come across the expedition of our heroes - a knight working for the Holy Inquisition, his band of professional warriors, and Osmond, a young monk who guides them to their destination: a village surrounded by marshes and inexplicably spared from the plague.

Third, the historical context and details seem to be remarkably accurate or, perhaps more modestly, I should just mention that I did not spotted any significant ""howlers"". In addition to the context mentioned above, this includes the two main characters - Ulric (Sean Bean), the leader of the band of soldiers serving the Church and tasked to root out heretics by any means, and Osmond (Eddie Redmayne), the young, totally inexperienced and somewhat nave monk who guides them on their way. These two characters, in particular, had much more depth to them than what I was expecting. Ulric is not only a brute, a soldier and a ruthless killer driven by his faith, and Sean Bean has a bit of a field day in playing the part. Osmond is not only a boy, pure and innocent (he is not entirely innocent, by the way). I also very much liked some of the other characters, in particular the ""unnervingly"" smiling Tim McInnerny.

Fourth, there is the gore and fighting. Surprisingly, there is not too much of either. I was expecting more, but it is both credible and sufficient. There is only one significant fight when Ulric's troop is attacked by bandits on its way, but it is a rather spectacular one, with a clear emphasis put on making it as ""realistic"" as possible. I had expected also a big fight towards the end, with our heroes being, of course, finally victorious, but this is NOT how the film ends and, as far as I am concerned, I was surprised by the ending.

So, for me at least, this little film turned out to be an unexpected gem. It is not the biggest gem you can think off. It is not the purest or the most precious one, either, but it is a little gem all the same, and enough of one to have watched the film a couple of times over the last few months.",1340150400,3,4067,4.527891156462585
4335424,2,B004DY3N9Y,"I was expecting the movie to live up to the name and be about the plague, but the black death only provided a backdrop to the action. The story is about religion, power, culture, and paranoid ""justice"" in the middle ages. But that's not exactly right either because the writer didn't do a great job of researching. Things like knowing that only a priest can give last rites (not a novice) make a big difference in believability of the plot. Lots of good actors were cast, but it was sadly a waste of talent. Add to that the shaky-cam and weird cuts and you have a disjointed film. If you are going into this with the intention of suspending reality and going along with a dark, head-slashing, blood gushing medieval fantasy ride, you will enjoy it.

The bad:
There are a few scenes shot from cameras attached to the actors like in The Blair Witch Project. They look jerky and out of place. They do take the time to show the horrors of the times. However, it seemed like they had two different effects teams that did not know about each other.
In spite of a great set up... it all fizzles out with a less than satisfactory ending.

Fearing for her life and hoping to escape ""God's wrath,"" beautiful Averill (Kimberley Nixon) chooses to leave a town that has only recently fallen prey to the illness. The man she loves, a novice at the local monastery, refuses to go with her but she tells him she will wait for him for five days at their former meeting place in case he changes his mind. Young Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) is torn between his love for her and his devotion to Christ, and sees an opportunity to reconsider when a group of men arrive at the monastery on a mission from the bishop. Rumor has it a village in the wilds has not yet been touched by illness and is guarded over by a necromancer.

Ulric (Sean Bean) has been dispatched to find the witch or warlock and execute them. But in the woodland between the city and the village lie many perils and at the far end, rampant paganism and other evils await them. The script is surprisingly solid for a B-movie and certainly has enough creepiness and horror to make this an unusual period drama. It has a great cast and decent costuming and design, but it's also unpleasant at times to watch -- not merely for its cruelties but also its rather harsh view of Christianity. Neither Christians nor atheists nor pagans are cast in a very good light, because it all boils down to an entwined series of events built around revenge. Osmund seems the most faithful but in a twist is revealed to have forsaken his compassion for pursuing the slaughter of innocents in God's name. Without revealing too much, in the village they encounter a woman professing to be (or faking it) a necromancer and the villiagers offer them life if they renounce their faith in God. (Of course, they don't intend to keep their promise.) The villiagers believe that killing Christians will keep them safe from the plague.

Numerous times, the plague is referenced as God's judgment on all people. Ulric takes his role seriously as a man who kills in the Church's name, and they tote along a torture machine. Supernatural elements are present -- Osmund is haunted by visions of someone he loved haunting him, drenched in blood and full of accusations; it appears that a woman has been resurrected from the dead (later, it is said it was a trick, but the audience is never quite sure). The R-rating is well deserved for moments of explicit violence and intense thematic elements. The scenes in which the men are killed one by one and asked to renounce God are hard to watch. And the script is quite clever in constantly keeping us guessing as we try and figure out who the bad guys are here -- is it Ulric? the witch? the villiagers? Osmund? The ambiguous nature of the story leaves it open to interpretation but at the end of the day it's the lack of inclusion of any sort of moral governing force that leaves a bitter taste. It's a very dark, rather sick, and depressing look into an interesting and horrible time in European history.",1332892800,2,3089,4.563963963963964
4335430,4,B004DY3N9Y,"After watching this film, I feel like I should check my 'pits for pus-filled boils or something. BLACK DEATH may be, to quote director Chris Smith, ""a 'guys on a mission' movie that's set in medieval England"" but there's more to it than that. It's a moody supernatural period film. There's a thought-provoking element at play, and a grittiness and a nasty streak. It challenges your perceptions.

As historians know, in 1348 Hell came to Earth in the guise of the Black Plague, a disease so malevolent it killed off 50% of Europe's population. The 14th Century isn't exactly known for its enlightened era (it's known more for the Great Famine of 1315 and the Hundred Years' War), and the sweeping pestilence inspired ignorant superstition and vile persecution. The desperate populace turned to passing judgment on each other, suspecting that demons and witches lurk in their midst.

Murmurs abound of a remote village in the marshlands that remain untouched by the sickness, a village that shelters a necromancer. Sir Ulric (Sean Bean), knight envoy to the Bishop, is sanctioned by the Church to bring the necromancer to justice. Joining Sir Ulric and his band of unsavory men is their guide, the conflicted young monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne). Osmund harbors an ulterior motive. Deep in the marshlands he hopes to meet his childhood sweetheart. But Sir Ulric has lied to him, has informed Osmund's monastery that he and his men are on an errand of mercy. But the Iron Maidenesque device strapped on to Ulric's wagon belies his words.

On the surface BLACK DEATH looks to be a bleak medieval horror adventure film, but you need to peek closer. The story places our gents in morally complex scenarios. It raises themes dealing with faith and religious zeal and fundamentalism. The movie's ending leaves you debating whether there really was a supernatural element at work. At the end, you question the characters, you question their worldviews. It doesn't help that Sir Ulric's troop of men is composed of sinister warriors (one of whom is a professional torturer). Sean Bean turns in a strong performance as the righteous Sir Ulric who does occasionally exhibit moments of clemency (or, let's say, relative clemency). Sir Ulric doesn't stray from his devotion to God. You may or may not blame his unshakable faith for what befalls him and his men when they finally arrive at their sought after destination. They take in the friendly, hospitable village and can you blame them for harboring doubts? That is, excepting Sir Ulric. He persists in his claim that dark forces hold sway in the village. Perhaps.

Osmund the monk may've been our default point-of-view character, but there's a callowness about him which made me sort of dismiss him. And neither Sir Ulric's stoic nature nor his unrelenting beliefs endear him to this viewer. Me, I found myself sympathizing the most with the world-weary veteran, Wolfstan, who as thoughtfully played by John Lynch proves to be the wisest soldier in Ulric's seedy bunch.

I frankly thought this would be scarier. Credit the film for its wealth of macabre imagery and the oppressiveness which blankets each scene. These lend a chilling atmosphere. There are a few sword fights and so credit, too, the realism and brisk brutality that went into the staging of them. Sucks not to have a band-aid or Neosporin in the 14th century. I recommend BLACK DEATH. It's not a by-the-numbers movie. It'll make you think. It'll surprise you. I did not see that unsettling coda coming at all.

4335431,4,B004DY3N9Y,"The Year of Our Lord 1348: the Black Death ravages Europe.  At a monastery, novice monk Osmund is separated from his love by his faith.  Soon after, a band of soldiers arrive.  They need a guide to find a remote village supposedly free of the plague; Osmund agrees to guide them, not knowing that the soldiers' true quest is to capture an evil necromancer.

BLACK DEATH is a refreshingly uninhibited little horror film.  It's ambiguous enough to please both genre lovers and those like myself who are a little more skeptical (I prefer some brains behind my horror, thank you very much).  Yes, it's a bit predictable, but that's to be expected.  Director Christopher Smith knows his way around a period piece, shooting from Dario Poloni's delightfully minimalist script; Smith lets the horror of the moment sink in, never lingering too long, never showing too much, never letting a dramatic swell of music cue the viewer that yes, something awful is happening.  He also managed to wrangle a fine cast: as young Osmund, Eddie Redmayne gives a truly credible performance.  Sean Bean lends some brawn (and, later, some good dramatic chops) as the soldiers' leader, with Jon Lynch providing a fantastic performance as the moral soldier Wolfstan.  (It's also nice to see David Warner in a small supporting role; he doesn't get enough work these days.)  All of this adds up to a film that doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but is still a welcome film.  It's small and unambitious, and as such, it manages to offer up a few thrills that horror films rarely have these days.  I won't say that BLACK DEATH will scare your socks off; but it will unease you, and if nothing else, it's proof that horror doesn't have to sink to low levels to be entertaining.",1329955200,2,1752,4.723684210526316

The characters aren't compelling (the dialogue is terrible, there are no surprises, and the main character isn't actually Sean Bean).

The characters themselves are fine for sure, but nothing spectacular. I am not one who watches a lot of horror generally. The historical setting, the plot, and prior reviews drew me to watch this movie. I was not disappointed. If you are a fan of Marion Zimmer Bradley's fantasy books, e.g. Mysts of Avalon, then you will find a good bit in common with this story.",1329004800,2,504,4.489130434782608
4335434,3,B004DY3N9Y,"I watched Black Death and Season of the Witch a week apart, which gives some perspective on what goes right and what goes terribly wrong in both films.  They both share a similar plot: during the Black Plague, holy knights (in both movies, Teutonic Knightss judging from their attire) are sent to retrieve a witch who is to be put on trial for her crimes, a crime tied to the plague.  In Black Death it's a town that avoids the plague and is rumored to bring the dead back to life; in Season of the Witch it's a witch who is believed to have caused the plague. Black Death features Sean Bean as Teutonic Knight Ulric, responsible for marching to the village to bring back the necromancer.

In need of a guide, Ulric drafts novitiate monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) into service.  Osmund is in love with Averill (Kimberley Nixon) but has sent her away for fear that she will contract the plague - he joins the quest in the hope of reuniting with her.

Ulric's ratag band of warriors includes Wolfstan (John Lynch), Wolfstan's friend Griff (Jamie Ballard), Dalywag the torturer (Andy Nyman), Mold (Johnny Harris), the mute Ivo (Tygo Gernandt), and chatty Swire (Emun Elliott).  This is one of those Seven Samurai-style films where the audience has to connect with the warriors quickly, so they are each given a signature weapon, combat style, or personality tic.  This is important because they're probably not going to all survive.  Also, it features Sean Bean, so they're all screwed.  SPOILER BEAN: It's become an ironic trope that every character Sean Bean plays is a flawed figure that dies heroically to atone for his sins (see Lord of the Rings, Equilibrium, Games of Thrones).

The village, it turns out, is in fact untouched by the plague.  Hob (Tim McInnerny) seems like the leader, but Langiva (Clarice van Houten) lurks in the background with her modern ideas and her clean hair and makeup. Something else is going on here: Langiva belongs to a tradition predating Christianity.

Black Death is far more interested in testing its protagonist's souls than it is in telling a compelling tale.  As TV Tropes put it, the film pivots on an ""idiot ball"" - a moment where the character's stupidity fuels the entire plot. The assembled suspicious, hardened warriors do something really stupid that lands them in hot water.  They get what they deserve.

What happens next is either a startling revelation or very predictable. Black Death has a lot in common with The Wicker Man in that it features torture, reversed gender roles, and a test of faith in the face of pagan practices. What Black Death brings to the genre is the strengths and weaknesses of the men as they are slowly picked off one by one.

This is not an uplifting film.  It's also surprisingly cerebral, discounting one gory combat scene. If you're a fan of Sean Bean (or maybe if you aren't) Black Death is worth watching.  Just don't expect to feel good about it later.",1328400000,2,2935,4.7215686274509805
4335435,5,B004DY3N9Y,"If you expect exciting medieval adventures and swordfights, this movie is not for you. This film is in fact a story about a trial of faith imposed upon a small group of men in England, in time of possibly the worst cataclysm in history of Europe: the deadly plague of 1348-1352. This horrible epidemic killed 50% of Europe population in only four years (and probably as much as 60% of population of England, Wales and Scotland). There was no cure for the plague in this time and a great majority of people who became ill died - and their death was a horrible and painful one. This epidemic is generally known as ""Black Death"", but in my personal understanding of the movie, the title does not refer only to the plague (see below).

The story takes place in 1348, somewhere in England (LIMITED SPOILERS FOLLOW). As the plague is killing hundreds of people every day, rumours start to circulate that there is an isolated village in the middle of marshes, which not only is magically protected from the epidemic but in which a necromancer raises the dead from their graves. Later, even worse things are told about this place, tales of blasphemous pagan ceremonies, human sacrifices and even cannibalism. Initially sceptical, local bishop finally dispatches his personal envoy and a group of soldiers to investigate. The movie will follow them as they go towards their destiny...

The personal envoy of the bishop is a noble knight, Ulric (Sean Bean), a grizzled veteran of many wars, who recently lost all his family to the plague and for that reason is in deep mourning. Ulric is a wealthy man, quite educated for a provincial knight (he can read and write and even speaks Latin). He is a natural leader both feared and respected by his men and he is also a devout Christian, but his recent loss brought him to the verge of madness. He accepted this mission in part to keep his sanity by getting busy and forgetting at least partially the death of his wife and children.

Ulric's second in command is Wolfstan (John Lynch), a middle aged man who seems to be a squire who never became a full knight. He is a tough man who makes his living with the sword in hand, but is also well spoken, honourable and good to his word.

The rest of the group is a wild bunch of professional foot soldiers, tough and battle scarred veterans all of them. They served together in France under Edward III and fought in the great battle of Crecy in 1346. Griff (Jamie Ballard) is Wolfstan's best friend and they travelled and campaigned together for years. Swire (Emun Elliott) seems to be the youngest of the group, he is also the most talkative, the most wise-cracking and the only one who seems to really care about his clothes and haircut.

Mold (Johnny Harris) is a rugged peasant who long time ago chose the battle axe other the scythe and never regretted the choice. Ivo (Tygo Germandt) was once captured by the French and later rescued by his companions - but not before his captors cut his tongue... Last but not least there is Dalywag (Andy Nyman), a man who once was a bandit, later became a mercenary and who now works for the bishop as torturer and executioner. At one moment Swire tells about him ""he is a torturer and executioner; he is also a thief, a murderer and a defiler of women - but other than that he is really a good man...""

In his quest Ulric needs a guide who knows the local forest and especially the treacherous marshes. Being the personal envoy of the bishop he commandeers for this purpose Osmund, a young monk from a monastery near the marshes. Osmund, who is barely out of his teens, actually is quite eager to go, because he has his own agenda, which will have a considerable influence on the rest of the story...

Once they reach their destination Ulric and his men expect to meet great danger in this isolated village and they will be served beyond their worst expectations! They will be tried and tested in their chair but even more in their faith - and the test will be so horrible that at one moment some of them will be ready to fight for the privilege of being tortured and killed because the alternative will seem too horrible to contemplate! Some will pass the test and some will fail - and in both cases there will be surprises...

In my personal opinion to better understand the second part of the movie (the trial of faith) it is important to remember some fragments from the Bible. You should ponder the First Commandment, the story about Jesus being tempted by the Devil in the wilderness, the fragment which describes how Judas died and the passage of New Testament about the false prophets. It is also important to remember that one of the names of Satan is ""The Prince of Lies""...

The Devil being present in every place and time where and when even a single human being lives, he is also very much present in this village. Unusual (at least for XIV century England) customs observed by the villagers and especially by their leader will allow the Prince of Lies to have some very special fun with the newcomers. The terrible trial of faith to which Ulric and his men will be submitted will decide if they save their souls or if they are damned and can be claimed by Satan.

Now, Satan is of course interested in every human soul and tries to attract toward damnation as many people as he can, without ever giving up on anybody until his/her very last breath, but some are obviously more interesting than others. Ulric is so horribly damaged by his recent loss and in so much pain, that he is nothing more than a burned out wrecked empty hulk of a man he once was. His men all spend their lives killing, plundering and committing all other deadly sins - and with the possible exception of Wolfstan they are already more or less damned anyway. So dragging them to hell seems to not be much of a challenge for the Devil, but rather just a routine chore, necessary and useful but uninspiring, like repainting the outhouse...

But with Osmund, this is a whole different story. He is very young (probably around 18), he is gentle and peaceful by nature and being an orphan he lived all his life protected by friendly monks and under tender care of the old abbot who raised him almost as a son he never had. Even if he is a sinner, as all men, the sheltered existence he led preserved him from most of the worst aspects of life - and therefore his soul is mostly innocent and pure. For the Devil, Osmund is the top prize in the game he sets and capturing this soul would be in devilish works the equivalent of painting the Sistine Chapel. It is also quite frequent that the purer the person before he/she turns bad, the worse will be evil he/she visits on the world. For all those reasons Osmund will be tried, tested and tempted in the worst possible way, with indeed devilish cunning and sadistic cruelty.

But who gambles, takes the chance of loosing, no matter how loaded are the dice. And for that reason the final result will not be entirely satisfying for the Devil - although in my modest opinion he will still end ahead of the game... Ultimately, some of ""heroes"" will live and keep their chances to earn their salvation before their time comes. Some will die but save their souls. And some, be they dead or alive, will be claimed by the Devil and therefore suffer the real ""Black Death""...

I found this movie devilishly clever and surprisingly good and I encourage everybody to watch it at least once and decide if it is worthy or if it should be sentenced to the purgatory of charity sale or even the damnation of garbage bin. Enjoy!",1326153600,7,7567,4.518626734842951

But I would say it is also the kind of movie that given a 1/2 hour to digest what you just saw, you will likely come to the conclusion that, in fact, it was pretty bad.

The movie is overdone, from start to finish.  I like Sean Bean but he has a tendency to overact and overact he does; but I can overlook that since, somehow, he is still interesting to watch.  The visuals surrounding what it may have felt like during a plague was pretty good; but there really wasn't anything particularly good about the story and the ending, which some describe as a surprise, seemed pretty predictable to me.

Handsomely filmed & acted medieval drama about the hypocrisies of religion. In this case, Christianity & Paganism, involving God's wrath through the Bubonic plague, & a village that has been left untouched by it. So the Bishop's soldiers go to investigate for witchcraft.

A text book example of how religion breeds ignorance & blindness to ones surroundings, & how both religions end up dealing with the other in the same sadistic ways. A true analogy to today's environment, & yesterday's, & tomorrows.

4335440,4,B004DY3N9Y,"THe black death killed about half the population of europe, to those living through this it was like the end of the world. This movie is not a horror movie , but a story about the horror of the time. IN fact some people did behave quite well during this disaster but in many other cases everything broked down and mobs killed jews and others, flagelents went down the roads beating their backs with whips. Whole towns vanished for good never to be seen again. ANd this was only a hundred years after the mongols had destroyed parts of eastern Europe. This movie depicts a group of men going after a village who they believe is using magic to stay plague free. And something like that could have happened. (people going after a plague free village), then they throw in a necromacer who supposedly can raise the dead. In the village the people have gone celtic in religion , and this point must be made , that storyline is highly doubtful. As by the 1300's celtic religion was forgotten almost completely.  Still this is a brutal and savage movie and the violence is very accurate looking. In fact people in those days went to public executions to watch people be hacked to pieces. Anyways, I wasn't sure if the woman was supposed to be a real witch or not. YOu'll have to watch this to find out. The blu ray looks very good and this actually played in the theaters on a limited basis. It was here in Colorado at a arthouse theater. This blu ray also features deleted scenes and other extras. The acting is very good because the great Sean Bean is in this one. It's pre ""game of thrones' and made in germany. It's supposed to be england though which doesn't matter.

I know some will feel that the investigators should be ones to die. The story was okay, with good action scenes, good gory make up, nice mystery, tension and even a little love and romance. If  it had a deeper meaning it was lost in all the noise as there was no clear theme as far as I could reckon. So should you pay to see it or wait for it to make network television? I am leaning towards waiting, either way though, there is a good chance you will find it entertaining.",1322956800,2,794,4.122580645161291
4335443,4,B004DY3N9Y,"This movie really came out of nowhere for me. I heard a little buzz about it but I didn't expect it to be so effective. The medieval era is perhaps my favorite in history, especially the time of The Black Plaque. Why? I guess that misery, terror, death and religious fanaticism appeal to me, bored as I am with capitalism and the modern secular state.

So here is another film about this fascinating time period from long ago. The movie starts in very conventional fashion, with flashes of ""Name of the Rose"" and even the abysmal ""Season of the Witch"" with Nicolas Cage. But the cinematography, set design and costumes carry the opening sections even if the plot starts out by the numbers. A group of knights enlist a young monk to guide them to a remote village that is unaffected by the plague.

The journey is also predictable with a short battle scene in the forest. It's when the characters finally arrive in the village that this movie takes off into 5th gear. The Christian knights are drugged and tortured by the villagers, who abandoned Christianity for various pagan rituals but are now mainly atheists spearheaded by their godless cult leader. That the leader is a woman makes it even more intense as the battle of wills begin.

The knights are men of true conviction, not the wimpy middle class American Christians of today for whom Jesus is a bumper sticker. For these men, God is everything and death is preferable over any earthly secular pleasure. For the viewers who think this is an anti-Christian film, that is not so. This movie appeals to whatever perspective you may hold. If you're godless, you can interpret this movie as an example of religious fanaticism run amok and the violence it can lead to. If you're a Christian, you can interpret this film as one that teaches people to truly stand for God and their faith, even in the face of death. I thought it was a powerful film, whether viewed from one perspective or another.

The militant atheists, especially those who despise Christianity, are going to have a blast watching this movie for the torture and killing of Christians. But the Christians win in the end and are portrayed in a positive, heroic light. You can't help but feel for these knights and this young monk as they confront the godless heathens. This is a film with a message but the filmmakers don't really take sides and let the audience's own prejudices guide the interpretation of the film. Sean Bean gives another classy performance. Eddie Redmayne has been doing a lot of medieval stuff lately and he's very good as the young monk. Carice van Houten plays the leader of the villagers with enough venom that one just wants to cut her to pieces. The supporting cast is also outstanding, with every knight given a strong personality.

Alright, so ""Black Death"" is not a great film by any measure but it is really well made and isn't just some exploitative trash like ""Season of the Witch"" and other nonsense that is floating around.

Just take my word for it and watch the movie! Also if you are a fan of Sean Bean or the Middle Ages/plague then you will love this movie.",1322438400,2,464,4.0
4335445,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Grim, and not a little depressing, this is a film about a very dark period in history.  This was a time when surviving was not an easy task.  If plagues didn't get you, religious persecution could.

The story involves two men of differing faith.  One man (Sean Bean) has an unwavering belief system in place, plus a keen sense of duty.  The other man, a monk (Eddie Redmayne), has a lesser, flawed faith.  How they deal with that faith and the task at hand is the heart of this movie.  Their job is to travel to a distant town untouched by the plague and discover why it has escaped the curse (God's judgment).  Naturally, they are traveling with specific orders in play and a decidedly preconceived notion as to how this town has escaped death (and how they should deal with that).
In those days, things were viewed simply, broken into two camps: good or evil.  Anything that was not Church doctrine was definitely evil.  Gray areas were never taken into account, if you were going to err, err on the side of God.  It wasn't a perfect system but it was all they had to work with at the time.  Atrocities were committed by everyone.

I viewed this film as an adventure with religious overtones.  I did not see it as anti-Christian.  I also didn't see it as ""A chilling piece of Gothic Horror,"" as the blurb on the DVD claimed (they also called it ""an occult thriller"").  There was very little horror to be had and as for the occult, it was briefly touched on then dismissed in favor of religious fervor.

I found this movie to be well done, fascinating, and highly entertaining, also sad and not something I'd ever want to watch again.",1321920000,7,1635,4.451178451178452
4335446,1,B004DY3N9Y,"As much as I like Sean Bean and this genre in general, I cannot recommend this title to anyone.

This film is basically a gorefest set in 13th century, plague-ridden Europe, and chronicals the journey of a young monk and a band of church mercenaries who are charged with finding and rooting out pagans who have been able to avoid the plague. The plot is simple enough.  The problem is, there is no protagonist to root for and no ""villian.""  Everyone is equally deranged by their religous beliefs, even the pagans, and the movie is one scene of pointless gory battle, gory torturing, death, and suffering after another.

I guess if you want to see and hear graphic depictions of beheadings, cruxification, drawing and quartering, hacking of limbs, etc., then this may be for you.  Not that I have a problem with such depictions in movies, but they serve no purpose here other than to shock.

By the end of the movie, you don't care who lives or dies, and the movie ends on a sour note by turning the main character into a vengeful blood fiend.  There are no great battles to speak of, just a gory skirmish in the woods involving people who are not central to the plot.

The church believes that the Devil or his servant is creating the death and has set up shop in the village.  I was expecting that there were going to be some medieval zombies or something but alas just a difference of opinion on the goodness of God.  The film is given legitimacy with Sean Bean (currently watching in ""The Game of Thrones"") and Eddie Redmayne (last seen a couple months ago in ""The Yellow Handkerchief"").  Smith doesn't play favorites in his convictions with both the Christians and the non-believers doing their share of bad deeds.

Black Death may not be the instant classic that A.N. is, but that's not the fault of the movie. It succeeds admirably in what it sets out to do.

Just what it sets out to do, however, seems to be the major point of contention in most of the reviews I've read, on amazon and elsewhere.

Did I see this movie as an anti-Christian screed, as so many ""Christian"" reviewers seem to?* Nope. nor did it come across as anti-religious, pro-atheist or any other such thing.

Is it a largely accurate portrayal of a bleak period in human history, with some fancified elements added to spice up the plot? Sure thing!  Those days are referred to as the DARK AGES for several reasons: ignorance abounded, life was short and often brutal, and those two factors often acted together to help keep most of Europe  (and the Middle East, and North Africa) miserable. The church, like it or not, was a big part of all that. Best take off your rosy glasses and face it.

I would dearly love it if the revisionist/apologist historians of the world, no matter what their faith (even the atheists and heathens), would keep said faith out of movie reviews, stop seeing devils hiding behind every door, and just generally mellow out. Life could be so much better. Sometimes I wonder if those folks are trying to bring about a new dark age for all of us - but I digress.

Is Black Death a perfect film? No. Is it far, far above average? Yes! If you like your historical drama on the raw and bloody side, mostly accurate with some fantastic elements thrown in, and really really Really DARK, this is your movie. Could easily (if somewhat unfairly) be described as Season of the Witch with 95% less hokey BS/Nicholas Cage.

If you want squeaky-clean peasants talking about how well-treated they are under their feudal landlords, fluffy animals dancing and singing, or sugar-coated anything, this one ain't for you.

Haven't seen the Blu-Ray, just the DVD and on the big (or, more accurately, medium-sized) screen. Picture looked fine on both. Would have liked more bonus features, but I'd ALWAYS like more bonus features, and was reasonably happy with what was included.

4335451,1,B004DY3N9Y,"Hollywood strikes again!  Let's attack Christians by making a movie where we take a sincere Christian (Monk-sincere faith with good heart) and turn him into a  fanatic religious killer that tortures women.  And let's use the backdrop of the plague, obvious distraction, so that we can bash the Christian faith without putting it right in front of you!  You think the movie is about the plague and corresponding hardships, but the real theme becomes clear as you see the ending.  It was all just a set-up to take a jab at the Christian faith.  They could have just as easily had this end with the Monk finding his true path to God, which was not a ""religious"" path , but one based on true love.",1316304000,10,693,4.504
4335452,4,B004DY3N9Y,"While this movie had a nice use of color and cinematography, I give it only 4 stars because it comes up alittle short. But as for the bad reviews for being anti-christian, ignore these. It does paint a bad picture of christianity, but only because it is showing the truth about the realities of many religions. Many older movies tried to glorify Jewish and Christian beliefs but that is hollywood. The more you read history books and not religious theologies, the more you see how religion was used to control and stifle people.
It is a fact that if you went against the popular belief it led to death. People are just mad at this movie for showing the more realistic side to what it was like to live in those days. It was not soccer moms coming out of their minivans for an hour and jumping back in to go to the mall.
Many reviewers feel Christians are portrayed in a bad light. Too bad. It is what it is. History paints more oppression and condemnation about Christians than a pastor painting some glorified picture to get his weekly donations.
One big focus of this movie is on how Christians want to put this village to death for not being affected by the plague. Take religion out of the scenario and if this had happened in real life, it would not lead to death, but curiosity as to why these people had survived where others have died. Religion has been proven to slow progress and science in the name God. Nostradomus was threatened for  his views and had to conceal them or be ridiculed. And many times people that did survive an incident or do something unexplained or misunderstood were put to death or punished. Enjoy this movie for what it is. If you are a religious fanatic and get insulted by this type of view, than pass on this movie. People are so fast to throw religious views in other people faces, but as soon as someone takes an alternative point of view they get mad. Grow up. The bible is filled with sooo much violence and dark stories it is awful. Being raised Roman Catholic I found the Bible to be horrific. It is not a feel good book. The historical parts of the bible, not the inspirational parts, are dark and depressing. Just history in general is violent and scary. Back before the Egyptians and foward, every historical account shows war, conquering, death and destruction. It is not just religion. But do not paint religion out to be feel good stuff. Life before the 20th century was hard. We are so spoiled today with our houses and cars and computers. If you had to endure those days, you would have to have tread lightly. So lighten up and learn to look outside faith. It is a movie that portrayed a different, but not untrue point of view. I do not like people that bring religion into reviews. It just confirms how uptight their religion has made them. Comedians make fun of religion all the time to make people laugh. Relax!!!",1316304000,7,2867,4.471374045801527

Obviously the director has used his talent, and I will admit he is a talented storyteller, for either misguided purposes or to deliberately distort and smear Judeao-Christian religion by generalizing ""all"" religion and religious belief by utilizing the period of the Dark Ages as the defining characteristic of ""all"" religios belief;  superstitious, ignorance and violence actally came as a result of  corrupt intitutions concealing the Bible from the masses and distorting its teachings to accomplish worldly goals of power and wealth.

It did keep my attention and was generally interesting but it is so consistently grim in nature as to make you want to roll over and die by the time it was over.

It is extremely well-shot and features exceptionally beautiful lighting. Clocking in at a bit over 90 minutes, everything is pretty straight-forward, as Christopher Smith does away with most of the fluff, giving us some of the best and speediest exposition I have ever seen in a film, especially for a period piece like this (Chrisopher Nolan, you could learn a thing or two from Smith.) Also, don't be bothered to think about slow-pacing, things pick up rather quickly here. In summary, a group of bishop-appointed warriors find a young monk who agrees to guide them to a village. What you don't know (until a bit later) is that this monk has been corrupted by love and agrees to join the men only to reunite with his lover. Following the plot, this village they seek has been spared by the plague, which is why these men have been appointed to ""investigate"" the reason behind this strange occurrence. The Bishop, of course, believes that this ""miracle"" is a result of witch-craft. When the men arrive, they find something else. If anything, this film has a very satisfying ending.

Sean Bean is tasked by the Bishop to locate a village in the marsh where it is rumored they have not been affected by the plague and the village is run by a necromancer. A young monk who knows the marsh, leads them. Some things happen along route, but the story doesn't really get going until they are in the village of ""Thomas Tryon"" led by a pagan woman skilled in herbs. At this point the movie takes its anticipated twist. Overall the ending was a let down for me.

The acting was acceptable. No one tried to talk with funny accents. The action scenes were quick as the movie is built upon reoccurring themes. I think a better ending and a different soundtrack was needed. It is a little like Season of the Witch without the witch.

4335464,3,B004DY3N9Y,"If you like movies that take place in medieval days, this is certainly an authentic looking film - the costuming, the armor, the hair and makeup, the rotten teeth. There's no ""Lord of the Rings"" glamour here. There is, however, lots and lots of bloodshed, combat, torture, crucifixions, dismemberments, and all sorts of physical pains. The movie's description suggests that the story takes a supernatural approach to The Plague, but whether this is or isn't the actual case (I won't spoil it for you) the movie is very visceral and real and doesn't pull any punches in its depiction of medieval life. The movie is almost so brutal, however, that it's hard to develop any interest in what's happening. I didn't feel myself caring for the characters at all, but whether that was my fault or the fault of the shallow character development, I can't be sure.

Across the board, the performances of the actors are all quite good. Sean Bean, of Lord of the Rings fame, always looks good in medieval get-up, but his character is pretty one dimensional and may even come across to some as cruel, unless you take the time to appreciate his motives.

In the end, the movie is just so depressing that there's really no reason to watch it again. Like I said, if you enjoy medieval stuff, you'll have plenty to feast your eyes on in this film, but if you're looking for an enjoyable movie night, I'd skip this one.",1312243200,3,1400,4.641129032258065
4335465,4,B004DY3N9Y,"I'm not sure why I'm reviewing this other than occasionally I just feel like reviewing something a little out of the norm for me, and this definitely fits that category.

Plot?  The plague has Europe in its grip, and the population is being decimated by something they just don't understand.  And when people don't understand something, they tend to turn to supernatural explanations, madly grasping for SOMEthing that helps them make sense of their world.

Basically the story involves a group of knights/warriors given a mission by a bishop to find a small village that has somehow escaped the ravages of the plague, and because it HAS avoided the infection, there must obviously be some supernatural evil goings-on and wrongs that must be righted (at least according to the church and the ever-faithful who follow it).

Sean Bean turns in a solid performance as a knight/believer wholly bought-in to his mission to carry out the church's sense of justice and apprehend and deliver to the bishop whoever it is who has been cavorting with the devil.  Bean does have a palpable presence in all these swinging-sword-flicks, honed in part with his role in ""Lord of the Rings"" and it helps give this movie a bit more weight.  And that's good because at times it seems almost like a ""made for tv"" effort.  There is a bit of gore, and the story does seem a bit contrived as to propel the story in a very specific direction, but I liked the fact it wasn't TOO preachy.

Bottom line take away from the story (for me anyway) is ""it's never prudent to blindly follow ANYbody or ideology.""  Neither the church nor some self-appointed pagan guru has all the answers.

So, that's what I got out of it anyway.  Not a great flick, but good enough, and it did hold my interest, and that's a feat in itself.  Three and half stars with a round up to four.",1312070400,3,1838,4.618461538461538

I love historical type movies (and it was a boring Saturday) .... so I rented it.

First of all, Sean Bean is completely under-rated as far as I am concerned. He is awesome in everything he does and he is great in this too.
The rest of the actors are excellent too. Especially the main character (who's name is escaping me).

The story was fairly strong and it was interesting to think about the plague in the Dark Ages and how it affected life. It also make you think about how religion and faith directed people's attitudes and actions in this time. Fascinating subject!

Yes the ending was not the best, but I believe it was extremely plausible and I found myself ""buying into"" it.

Generally I prefer movies that are on location (and not on a set). This movie is filmed on location in and around a German forest which gave much credence to the look and feel of the film.

Also the costumes, gear, buildings, etc etc were first rate. They all lend themselves to the time and the story.

I would have liked to see more depth and in general.... just more to the movie. All the characters seem to be killed off and it leaves you with ""wanting more"". Especially how the ""authorities"" and people around the characters interact in more depth and it did seem a bit short.

I would NOT let children see this movie. Violence and some sticky situations that you'll find yourself explaining to a little one... best not let them see it.

I also would of liked a more dramatic hard hitting score.

I am sure there were women who were well educated leaders of their people (Queen of England, Catherine the Great, etc.) but for some reason it was hard to buy the woman leader in this movie.

All in all, this movie was a great one! I should probably give this a 4 star rating instead.

4335469,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Sean Bean, still sporting his fresh-of-the-set of HBO's Game of Thrones shag, plays the Bishop's go-to badass (Ulric) in this compelling medieval mystery-action movie.  His team of mercenaries is guided toward a marsh village by a young monk (Osmond) with ulterior motives of forbidden romance.  Their mission is essentially a witch hunt.  This marsh village has been rumored to have been spared by the black death and its people, naturally, must be in league with the devil.  Ulric and his men have been charged to find their God-renouncing heretic leader and bring him back to be tried and executed in the name of God.

 Ulric is as gritty and callous as they come.  He was ""chosen by God"" for this mission and would sooner gut a wrongly accused innocent than be troubled to detour his mission.  Bean's Ulric is rather extreme, but easily likeable by any typical Maxim subscriber.  However, it is the young monk (played by Eddie Redmayne) who brings the sincerity to the screen.  He anthropomorphizes the compassion, desperation, fear and longing of Everyman while Ulric filters all such characteristics through a prism of fanatical devotion to his charge.  Ulric's mercenaries initially depict greed, yet later favor to their fellow soldiers and demonstrate surprising camaraderie when faced with the worst.  They are dirty, ratty-haired, and perfectly credible ""tough guys"".

 I was a bit confused by the action scenes in this movie.  They were brutal and cool, but would have been much better without the palsy-shaky camerawork.  Maybe this camera style was meant to help the tone, but then why put so much effort into the gore, choreography and surroundings if the intended filming style only masks the effects of such efforts?  Again, the battle scenes were good.  This was also one of few movies which well-identified how exhausting it is to swing a sword for 60-90 seconds.  Not since The 13th Warrior have I seen that portrayed so accurately.  Ensuing the fray, these guys sounded like a fat kid after running a mile for his high school physical fitness test.

 Finally Ulric and his men reach the quiet, plague-free, hospitable town.  They are welcomed, wounds are dressed, and they are hosted with dinner and lodging.  Here's where I have to stop giving details.  I'll close by saying that I really like this movie, although there was (what I consider to be) a big oversight in the scenes which transitioned between the middle and end portions of the movie.  I'm not saying that it's obvious or that everyone should catch it, but I felt like it was an insult to my intelligence as a viewer for the screenwriters to assume that viewers wouldn't catch it.  This ranty nit-picking aside, if you liked Sean Bean in ""any"" other movie then I vote you see this one.

 Fair warning, I feel that they showed more than they should have in the trailer.  Not that it obviously gives anything away, but I suggest that you do NOT watch it.  I didn't see it before watching the movie.  I'm glad I didn't.",1310428800,11,3001,4.834970530451867

The movie's plot centers around The Plague, which swept through Europe during the 1300s, killing almost half (if not more)of Europe's population.  However, there is a village that is not ""touched by the plague,"" according to the Bishop, and he says that this village must be populated with ""necromancers,--  those who ""bring the dead back to life.""  Thus, he sends his most courageous Knight (Sean Bean) and a band of fearless soldiers, to find these ""necromancers,"" and bring them to justice (kill them).

So, begins the story and adventures of this this fearless knight and his brave soldiers and their plight to find this village in the marshland where the plague has not reached.  Enroute to this village, they visit a monastery to enlist the help of a monk who knows the marshland area where this village sets.  A young monk volunteers, for he is in love with a girl that he wishes to meet on the edge of a forest, near where this village lies.  This young monk views his role as ""guide"" as an opportunity to meet and be with the girl of his dreams.  Little does he know of the danger and betrayal that will soon set in as he travels with this knight and his soldiers to the village in this marshland.

What follows is grim terror.  I won't give the entire plot away, but viewers will be entertained, horrified, spooked and left very sad at the ending.  It will truly leave you sad and wonder why destiny (fate) played such a cruel hand to these seekers and religious fanatics.

Only one person was supposedly brought back to life, but she had not died to begin with, her burial was just faked.

I don't think I've ever seen a medieval movie that tried to be this realistic.  Possibly Kingdom of Heaven or parts of the Pillars of the Earth miniseries (maybe some of The 13 Warrior, too), but nothing else I've seen comes close.  One thing that impressed me is the clothing, armor, and weapons of the warriors.  Everything looks handcrafted, but not necessarily crafted well.  The armor looks worn and uncomfortable, like it doesn't entirely fit (as I imagine it wouldn't unless you were rich), and the weapons seem similarly suited to professional warriors who aren't noblemen.  I also appreciate that they picked a specific time and place -- England sometime around 1360 -- rather than just going for some generic medieval locale during a generic plague outbreak.

The acting is excellent, and the characterization and dialogue are surprisingly awesome.  As for the plot, it genuinely had me guessing about characters' motivations and just what was real and what wasn't.  I thought I had this movie figured out about ten minutes in, but it had me radically rethinking my assumptions about it right up until the end.

Since they are the burn the witch at the stake types, they are very excited to go get the witch.  On their way they pick up a young monk who knows the way.  But the young monk is suffering from a bit of a crisis of faith (well not faith - it's just that he's in love with a girl and wants to find a way to serve God AND get the girl).  So they hack a bloody and gruesome path to the hamlet where others of their types have been before.

Hate begets hate and violence leads to violence.  These happy little towns people are more than meets the eye, and lead by a viciously intelligent ""Necromancer.""  Based more on history (though loosely) than the supernatural the viewer watches as hate takes the front seat.

Some have said that this was a dark and dismal movie... and it is, but I think it has a profound meaning about when faith leads to hatred, that no one wins.

4335479,4,B004DY3N9Y,"I know there are some number of films containing the Black Plague or have the Black Plague as a backdrop, but this is the first I've seen that dealt specifically with that deadly historical disease.

Here's the scoop. A young monk on the religious fence agrees to guide some of the Bishop's soldiers to a remote village which has somehow managed to avoid being effected by the plague. His real reason for guiding the soldiers is to visit his girlfriend and see what side of the fence he will come down on. The soldiers are sure of what they will find and have weapons and instruments of torture to make things right. Of course, things go awry and it makes for a great ride.

Some great decisions were made in this movie. It has a good look and feel. This might be the only movie I've seen that gave me a genuine sense of what life might have been like back then. The costuming, buildings, ubiquitous death and despair were all present. It was shot well. Sometimes the camera was steady and sometimes it moved and the blend was good. I was drawn into the scenes. The casting was good. The band of soldiers was a group of individuals. They didn't run together. The casting agent made sure they didn't all look alike so you could pick each one out in a given scene, and they were all allotted as much personality as possible given the circumstances.

The story worked well too. Certain things happened sooner than I expected so it made me wonder where the proceedings would go from there. The Catholic Church has garnered a bad reputation in regard to that period of history and this movie doesn't shy away from showing them in a less than favorable light. These soldiers of God are on a mission and they are going to do what they are going to do no matter what they find. It's a no win situation for whomever is involved. I did wonder how the story would be resolved and was more than pleased with the ending. All too often films move like a freight train only to slip the tracks in the final scenes. Here I felt things stayed true.

This is a good movie that, at 102 minutes, is the right length for the content. It gives a good historical perspective yet maintains an innate ability to entertain.",1308873600,26,2196,4.4148148148148145

Its riveted chainmaile for crying out loud.
The fantasy wardrobe failed against the believable settings and was one of the two glaring issues that made me stop enjoying the film and want to watch anything with Ryan Seacrest (I hate Ryan Seacrest, though I'm not sure why).
Anyway, I recommend this film as it's really a well done piece of cinema, with actors who don't suck a lot. Too bad Dario Polonzi and Christopher Smith were so stuck on the whole  ""Christians are bad"" thing (study some history you tools), it kept it from being a really great flick and made me ask ""what is the point?"".

I like a good slasher movie, the more gore the better.  I like suspense and drama too.  This movie tried to combine them all - and actually did a fairly decent job.  It could of been a solid 3 star beauty in the rough.  HOWEVER, I'm getting a little miffed at movies that have an anti-hero ending simply to make it more artsy or make the director feel like there's some kind of deep meaning.  Some life changing moment in film.

That's fine and dandy if your owning a 5 star file (for instance Cold Mountain - kills the hero and still ends up being a fine movie).  Or your solid Trauma type movies like ""Hobo with a shotgun"" - ending MAKES that movie a solid 3 star gore fest.

If your a decent little 3 star movie and your going for that 4th star by killing your hero, just don't do it.  It pisses me off.  Anyway that's my rant.  Thanks for reading.",1306800000,4,881,4.209580838323354
4335492,2,B004DY3N9Y,"I'm a fan of Sean Bean and the Sharpe's series, and a graphic depiction of the 14th century and the horrors of the plague with the weird forces of nature and man at work seemed like a interesting night of movie watching for me.

A young church novice guides a rough and tough band of soldiers lead by Bean on a so called mission to discover the reason why a secluded village is unaffected by the plague.  In reality, the soldiers have a more sinister mission in mind.  The somewhat innocent novice struggles with his role in the goings on and what plight he may bring upon an apparently innocent village.

This is basically a road trip horror flick.  The acting, the sets all are fine and dismally display the pathetic time period where superstition and savagery rule.  And that's fine with me, but my complaint is that I didn't enjoy the film. The story left me wondering why I spent my time watching brutality and hopelessness without anyone or any theme, even in the slightest bit, that I wanted to follow or relate to.

Yes, I know it's the time of the plague, and it's a pretty ugly situation, but from start to finish, there's no redeeming message or heroism here.",1306800000,6,1170,4.490566037735849

Any belief, forged in tragedy and despair, can molt into disastrous outcomes.  I am actually curious as to why there was not more publicity for this particular film.  I believe it was supposed to be released to theatres in 2010.  I am not going to jump on any conspiracy theory that it was held back because of controversial religious themes.

4335494,2,B004DY3N9Y,"I'll say up front two things about BLACK DEATH. The first is that it is a well made film, photographed well, acted well, directed well. The second is that it falls into a category of film I've tired of: trying to make Christians look responsible for every bad thing to ever happen in the world.

The time is 1342 and England is being ravaged by the Black Plague. The smell of death floats across the air in every corner of every location that exists. The dead are carted to the roadside to be taken away and rotting corpses are nothing unusual.

A monastery is no safer from the plague than anywhere else. Monks are dying just as the everyday citizens are. Young Osmond (Eddie Redmayne) is a monk early on in his life. Having sworn his life to God he also has done the forbidden by falling in love with childhood friend Averill (Kimberly Nixon). Insisting she leave town before she falls victim to the plague, she gives him a last chance: abandon God and follow me. She tells him she will wait for one week in the town they grew up in and then move on with her life.

Once Averill leaves a new group enters. This is an emissary of the Bishop, a warrior named Ulric (Sean Bean) who is en route to find a town where it is said no one dies or is affected by the plague. He's looking for a guide and Osmond, having just asked God for a sign what to do, jumps at the chance since the town they seek is next to the one he grew up in. That town holds the chance of returning to Averill.

The journey is slow moving as the men walk and one cart is pulled along, a cart that contains the tools of torture used to force confessions of witchcraft and necromancy from helpless victims. The warriors that accompany Ulric all have their own short tales to tell, how they came to this place and what they expect to find. Bloodthirsty and ready for action they get their chance early on.

Near the town, Osmond sneaks off one morning to see if Averill awaits. To his dismay he only finds her cape drenched in blood and a group of thieves, weapons drawn. Osmond runs back and alerts the warriors who take up arms and battle the larger numbered thieves. They win but at what costs as one of their own lies dying and Osmond is wounded.

Moving forward they come to the marshland that holds the mysterious city they are searching for. They enter and find the inhabitants at first inhospitable, but after pretending to seek sanctuary they are welcomed to spend the night. A pale and well groomed woman takes Osmond with her and tends to his wound with a poultice. The rest wander about trying to figure out which one is the necromancer, the wizard, that has taken this village under his wing.

At dinner they discover that there may be more than meets the eye in this group. Are they truly bewitched? Are they pagans, worshipping the devil himself? Or is it just that this town is lucky? Perhaps they've discovered a secret that keeps them alive.

In short order (and hopefully without giving too much away) a confrontation involving the warriors being forced to recant their beliefs in order to stay alive is offered and a discussion about the horrors inflicted on many because of their belief in Christianity ensues. Christians are depicted as believe like me or die while pagans are shown as understanding and compassionate yet eventually acting the same way. Follow my way or die. A twist ending feels more tacked on than a part of the whole.

While both sides are shown to have terrible flaws in their religious backgrounds and thinking, the more damaging presentation is tossed at Christians. Certainly if you go back and check history you will find that Christians did some terrible things in the name of God (anyone ever heard of the Inquisition?).  But if all you had to go by was this film you'd think Christians did nothing but attempt to exterminate people and that pagans just wanted to be left to their own devices. The truth is a combination. Both sides did wrong at one time or another. To depict one as being more aggressive at it just shows us another movie maker taking a swipe at Christians.

One thing this movie definitely illustrates. Those of us who can remember far back know of a time when Hollywood made movies like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, KING OF KINGS and BEN HUR. All of these movies painted Christianity in a good light. With the inclusion of historical ""accuracy"" into films in the late 60s, things changed. It was no longer considered cool. Weird religions started popping up and those new age followings were given a wider birth to be explored than Christianity. So what happened? Why did it become wrong to believe in God? And why is it that the only religion that seems to be fair game is Christianity?

I can't give an answer to that other than to believe offers more restrictions than these new age religions. And God knows Hollywood doesn't want to be restricted from anything.

In any event out of 5 stars I would give this movie 3 just for the quality of the production. Were it on content alone I'd have to slide down to 2. But if it were rated on the basis of how much it would offend or upset someone its 5 stars all the way. Perhaps I took it to hard or too serious.

4335497,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Filmed in Germany, ""Black Death"" takes place in medieval England, while the Bubonic Plague (which killed almost 50% of England's population in a few months) is ravaging the land.

The story: a young monk, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), is charged with guiding the Bishop's envoy - a small cohort of mercenaries and slayers led by the knight Ulric (Sean Bean, in an outstanding-as-usual performance) - to a remote marsh-surrounded village whose population appears to be immune to the plague, and which, for reasons never fully explained, has embraced godlessness and irreligion. Ulric has information that this village has ""turned its back"" on God and now he's traveling there to arrest, judge, and execute the presumably diabolical ringleaders that have led the villagers to apostasy. But Osmund has an ulterior motive in leading Ulric's group to the village: he is trying to keep a secret tryst with his forbidden love, Averill (Kimberley Nixon), who awaits him in the forest. With set-pieces that range from bleak battles and Bosch-inspired horror imagery, to scenes of eerie, depopulated, pastoral weirdness, ""Black Death"" manages to create an atmosphere of a civilization in the midst of upheaval, without going over the top in the creation of plague-scarred landscapes and hospital-morgue gore.

In the end, this film puts a simple, but nonetheless thought-provoking, question to its viewers: ""When you have absolute faith in something, and you act accordingly, and later you find out you erred horribly in your decision to follow your faith, what do you do then? How do you, knowing full well your error, live the rest of your life as one of the faithful?""

In the final scene of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", it was clear to most viewers that Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) found it easier to respond to Shelley Levene's (Jack Lemmon) situation by continuing to act like the consummate salesman, instead of responding with shock, sympathy, disgust, or some other form of genuine emotion. No, instead Roma acted like the salesman all the way to the end, and up to Shelley's eventual demise, because, to Roma, that was an easier way for him to deal with the situation than it was to confront the truth.

At the end of ""Black Death"", it appears Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) decides, similarly, to buy into what Ulric (Sean Bean) said to him earlier in the film: that demons and necromancers are indeed among us, corrupting the world with their diabolical evil; despite what Osmund himself had found to the contrary. And so, Osmund becomes the consummate witchfinder and destroyer of many innocent women. Guilt drives him to it; Osmund finds this is an easier way for him to deal with his life - to perpetuate this idea of witches and necromancers - than it is to confront the truth of the terrible thing he has done. It's easier to believe that the ""evil witch"" brought this great evil onto him, instead of believing the fact that he, Osmund, himself performed the evil act, and in God's name to boot.

Which brings us to the next question this film unintentionally raises: why must Christians always whine like little children crying ""It's not fair!"" whenever their made-up, fairytale, completely fictional religion is portrayed in anything other than a 100% positive light?

Because, for Christians, painting themselves as ""victims"" and their detractors as ""unreasonably critical and unjust"" is an easier way to deal with the fact that their religion, like so many others, has racked up a tremendous body count through the centuries, and continues to do so, without any evidence whatsoever that their god actually exists. This is what they must do, because the fact that every atrocity attributed to the Christian religion through the centuries was performed by actual, living, believing Christians who were acting according to their faith - doing things ""in the name of God""- is a truth too difficult for them to confront honestly. No, it is easier for today's Christians to cop-out with the ""a few bad apples"" explanation, and then revile all their critics for being ""unreasonable and unjust."" I think ""Black Death"" makes that point nicely, and so do a number of the Amazon reviews of the film.",1306108800,6,4176,4.992816091954023
4335498,1,B004DY3N9Y,"Let me start by saying that this movie starts off very well and in fact is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, until the end.

If they were trying to give it some twist, well they succeeded... unfortunately, the twist seem to make the writer of the story seem bitter towards anything spiritual and ruins what could have been a great picture.  Further, the ending has one knight totally change and become a different character, at least in his persona.  Then they have the monk change to a crazed sadistic killer.  I chatted with others who felt the same way after watching this movie and they all agreed, the ending does not match the rest of the movie.

The final 10 min of the movie after that should be cut in a subsequent Director's ""cut"".

4335500,4,B004DY3N9Y,"Sean Bean plays the part of Ulric, a mercenary knight on a mission for the Bishop.  There is a village that reportedly has not been affected by the bubonic plague (circa 1348 A.D.), and rumors indicate the reason why is a necromancer (one who brings the dead back to life) or a witch (one who uses herbs and spells) has some kind of unholy alliance with evil.  What follows is a Sci-Fi / Fantasy film of a brief introduction to the seasoned fighters among the rest of the crew of mercenary knights travelling with Ulric, and a young monk who knows the territory so the monk serves as guide.  The knights encounter a band of thieves who wield the weapons of that time period with above average skill, and that fight in the forest is possibly the high point of special FX.  There is a swamp to wade through and the viewer has to use their own imagination considerably during that sequence or end up wondering why that was even left in the movie.  Then there is the village.  From this point, the movie seems to be geared to educated, mature audiences who are strong fans of Sci-Fi / Fantasy, and this is possibly the most milquetoast type film if all you consider is religion.  There is no incredible degree of anti-Christian or anti-Pagan holy crusade anywhere as part of the intended message of this film, as some reviewers have commented.  I've seen stronger sentiment along religious lines on Sesame Street with Jim Henson's muppets.  The point of this film is the emotional awakening of the young monk, who loses his beautiful girlfriend (that he's not supposed to have), sees her seem to be resurrected from the dead, loses her again, and due to the trauma of the surrounding events compounding upon the pain of forbidden love ending badly; the monk now turns to near insanity as he seeks vengeance against women who allegedly practice what that time period considers to be the dark arts.  It isn't so much a religious thing as it is how he watched most of the mercenary knights tortured and killed, and as the young monk's innocence of adolescence was fading away, a forbidden love is overcome with tragedy that few would ever remain unchanged by.  Religion just isn't the focus, and anybody who thinks this is a religious film is grossly in error; the Dark Ages of that time period had very little understanding of any religion beyond the persecution and control of the Catholic Church at almost Spanish Inquisition levels.  However, the movie ""Black Death"" isn't making a statement about anything necessarily having to do with religion, the film delves into the psyche of human nature and how we are all shaped by the events, opportunities, and fortitude that affect our lives directly or indirectly.  As a product of our own experiences and environments, how we handle the years that pass will shape us in a myriad of directions, it simply falls to opportunity and resources after that.  In my mind, the leader of the mercenary knights ends up on the worst end of the mission, if you compare his demise to the village witch; but the movie doesn't let me feel sorry for either one of them.  In my opinion, this movie focusses upon the young monk and how circumstances change him as he matures.
Kimberley Nixon plays the part of the forbidden girlfriend, Marianne Graffam plays the part of the witch, and ""Black Death"" also stars Eddie Redmayne, David Warner, Carice Van Houten, Andy Nyman, Tim McInnerny, John Lynch, Emun Elliott, Johnny Harris, Tygo Gernandt, and other people who seem familiar and yet not so familiar.  The R rating for this film is for the violence and gore, but the weapons and fighting is well done, and although tastefully done female nudity would have rounded out the movie quite a bit (WOULD have, but if there was any I missed it), I still give this film a 4 star rating.",1305849600,3,3804,4.663677130044843

4335502,4,B004DY3N9Y,"This is not intended as a full review, since most of the reviews already written do a good job of analysing and commenting on the material. However, there are some things I feel need to be clarified, or at least given another opinion.

For starters, the camera work can be jarring at first, but it will eventually become more suitable to the material after the first 10 minutes or so.

The gore is minor. Too much has been made on this, because there are one or two brief shots that are somewhat repulsive, but nothing worse than what would have been shown in Lord of the Rings. It's not a Tarantino Grindhouse flick.

Lastly, the fights. Very disappointing. At least in how they were shot. Much attention is given to this part of the film in the special features, and sure, watching them rehearse the action is awesome, because you get to see it. Unfortunately, this film follows that horrible trend in Hollywood in which the use of quick, rapid cuts is supposed to give the action a more visceral, in-the-moment experience. What nonsense. It's an insult to the choreographers and denigrating to the performers when the action is not properly captured on screen.

Okay, that's all. My two cents. A very decent picture overall in terms of story, performances and pacing -- all that. The ending is a little messy: too jumbled, too much to wrap up in a few short minutes. Still a cool, mostly quality flick.",1305590400,7,1405,4.6305220883534135
4335503,5,B004DY3N9Y,"I was a bit hesitant about renting this movie at first, (the preview did not have enough information to go on)but after reading a few reviews, I decided to take a chance. I am glad that I did! Great movie! It is definitely well crafted, pulls you right in and has you wondering what is going to happen next. I find it really amazing when I think about it, how so many people ended up being killed simply because a certain behavior was perceived as abnormal by someone of a superstitious mind. The interesting thing is that this pattern is still seen today, but just in a more sophisticated form. I really like how the movie captured the young monk's inner quarrels, his doubts, his challenges with regards to his faith. I love how the movie depicted the chaos that was prevalent at the time. How our human fear of the unknown often compelled us (and continues to do so)to ""create"" knowns and become attached to them, and as Alan Watts once put it; forget that it was I who ""created"" the idol. This movie has great twists and I love the flow that was gained as the plot progressed. Much like making love. Momentum starts to gather and it inevitably reaches the point of climax. This movie unfolds into a situation where you are gripped to your seat wondering how the story will end, for it is as if there are no conventional, already conceived cookie-cutter ways that the story can possibly end! And that is the beauty! You have no idea where things will go next!

I would like to extend a word of caution though, there were parts in this movie that were clearly intended to give the viewer a close as possible taste of ""reality,"" of what you would have truly seen had you been there back then if you had witnessed actual hand to hand battles, etc. In other words, the sensoring as to what would happen to the body in actual hand to hand combat situaitons were not watered down or downgraded as far as editing is concerned. So if you are sensitive to such scenes, then you might not want to see this movie. I, personally feel that for a movie expressing such hostical context, that those scenes were quite necessary, a crucial tangent of the overall story.

Anyway, I don't mean to write my own book here, but I just wanted to share that this movie effectively pulled me into its plot and allowed my mind to go on an adventure through time. It is what I love so much about cinema! I hope it does the same for you!",1305417600,3,2412,4.381696428571429
4335504,4,B004DY3N9Y,"I couldn't pass up the chance to Sean Bean appearing as a ""Boromir"" character again, and it really wasn't a bad movie.  In fact, it could have been quite good if there had been more depth and development of the story line.  I also found it distracting that the director had to use the visual motif of the camera point-of-view being jostled around so much. It made for a frequently jerky presentation which didn't really lend anything to the ability to enjoy the action scenes more. The technique won't be new to you; many movies made during the past ten years or so have used jerky action scenes, so it's gotten to be ordinary fare.

As for the good-versus-evil, ""why did God let this happen?"" aspects of the story, well, you'll have to come to your own philosophical conclusions.  Suffice to say that this director likes the contemporary German cinema approach to these kinds of topics, and it makes for an unambiguous, starkly harsh depiction of this especially horrible time in European history.  Sean Bean is the best actor in it, of course, but Carice van Houten gave an excellent performance in her role as this story's prime anatagonist to the Christian ""invaders"".

See this movie by yourself, and don't choose it as the movie for a ""hot date"" unless your date is into extreme torture and gore.",1305417600,6,1302,4.68859649122807
4335505,2,B004DY3N9Y,"This movie has its fair share of swash-buckling action, but who knew the writers and directors would deviate completely from the movie's title and from the trailer??  I mean, could this movie have been any more anti-Christian??  I guess that's the price Christianity pays for being the world's more dominant religion.  This movie is VERY loosely based on fact, and more based on witches, wizards, evil, and oh yeah, the plague.  But the plague is the last thing on your mind here as a few warriors with the help of a young monk who is really trying to search for his lost love try to find the ""root cause"" of the pestilence, which at that time was strongly believed to be the workings of witches and witchcraft.  Magic and witchcraft was the science back then, and nowhere was there a scientist to tell them that it was probably the rats and dreary conditions Europe lived in all along.

Instead,  this movie wants the viewer to focus on the ""evils"" of Christianity and perhaps religion in general, and how Christians have killed more people in the name of ""God"" than anything else.  This is a very dark movie with none other than a divisive message for the viewer to take with him.  Seeing as this film is a European production, I'm not surprised on its content.  Europe separates itself from religion more and more as each day goes by.  A movie like this would not probably fly that well in the States.  In all honesty, there have been many instances since the dawn of civilization where people have killed and died in the name of some higher power or another.  Why does Christianity take most of the blame?  I wonder if they'll ever make a movie on how Islam has killed ten times as many people just in the last 100 years.....

Bet it'll be a cold day in hell before we see a movie like that.",1305417600,16,1795,4.46319018404908
4335506,5,B004DY3N9Y,"This is an awesome move.  STORY: very original and well done.  A group of warriors is going to a village that has avoided the plaque with the hint of black magic.  They pick up a monk who knows the area and is also in love with a girl from his hometown.  The village is not at all what they think and the mystery around the village and the leader is incredibly well done-don't want to give too much away!  BATTLES:  There are several fight scenes and they are as good as it gets for battles/fight scenes.  Great and brutal action (i.e. some Mike Tyson reconstructive surgery, lots of limbs and heads flying).  GREAT!  There are also some stomach churning torture scenes as well.  CHARACTERS: Most people know Sean Bean from his great performance in Lord of the Rings.  He has another great performance but the rest of cast is awesome as well (especially John Lynch and his character).  They are developed nicely.  SCENERY: This is one of the best parts of the film.  You feel like you are in the 1300's England.  Awesome sets from the monastery, to the village, to the forest to the marsh. CAMERA:  I know a few people complained about camera work, I disagree.  Most of the camera work is done standard and not shaky.  There are some battle scenes and when they are walking in the marsh that the camera men are in the action with them but this is not annoying it is awesome, it really makes you feel like you are in the battle or walking in the marsh-kind of like Saving Private Ryan). DIRECTOR:  OK, other than George Lucas I cannot name another director, until now.  I loved the movie so much I watched the special features which are great.  The director is Christopher Smith and you can tell how much he loves directing and working with actors.  I would really recommend watching the special features.  I will be looking for his movies in the future.  I really hate that this movie didn't make it to US theaters, I just don't understand it.  I would have loved to see it on the big screen.

4335507,4,B004DY3N9Y,"I don't typically review movies, but ""Black Death"" is a surprisingly good Dark Ages mashup of period drama, brooding horror, and even hack and slash action. The mood is pervasively bleak, as one would expect about any movie set in the time of the Black Plague, and therefore fitting. It opens oppressively and ends perhaps even more so, leaving nothing that even resembles a happy Hollywood ending, which will undoubtedly alienate some. So too will the violence, which often happens offscreen (including scenes of torture that could have ended up feeling like a Dark Ages version of ""Saw,"" but thankfully don't), but it is nonetheless raw and brutal. Point of fact, one mid-movie battle is brilliantly staged and shot, making the sword-crossing sequences in other such films, i.e. ""Centurian,"" feel cartoony by comparison. When the mood shifts over to that of a thriller or horror film, the movie doesn't so much as miss a step. The ending, which I'll not dare spoil, is a great turning of the tables, and provides moments of triumph and complete and total failure that seem cynically like one and the same. Not a feel good flick nor a scary horror film, it is instead a fine blending of the genres it tackles, all of them culminating in a satisfyingly grim message that will leave you pondering the film's themes as the credits roll.",1305158400,2,1334,4.829694323144105
4335508,4,B004DY3N9Y,"A well fleshed-out rendering of medieval plague hysteria that evokes the cruel flavor of frenzied proselytizing. What emerges appears to be supernatural fiction, but one of the strengths of the film is its historical plausibility. Modernist script sanfus, iffy directoral cuts, & occasional storyline drags prevent me from raving up to the 5*.",1305158400,,343,5.490566037735849
4335509,2,B004DY3N9Y,"I really wanted to like this movie but it got off on the wrong foot when I soon realized that the ""Black Death"" title was VERY deceiving. This movie is NOT about the Black Death. Yes, it is set in 1348 when the plague was getting going but the plague itself is just a backdrop. The real story here is about the Church and how it used its power to force people into line using savage mercenaries who would murder you without remorse to ""save you"". So it is a movie about the excesses of ""religion"" and ""control"" more than anything else.

The acting is not bad, the story ok, and overall I would rate this 3 stars but I had to take one star off for having a title that is just blatant false advertising. A better title would have been ""In The Name of God"" or something like that.

I would not buy this movie (but it was ok as a rental).

If you were waiting for the first good movie dealing with the Black Death which killed 1/3 of all Europeans in the mid 14th century, then you'll just have to keep waiting....",1305072000,6,1010,4.142857142857143
4335510,4,B004DY3N9Y,"It's quite a journey, Black Death is, nicely framed, relevant (how are religious terrorists made?  here's one way), well-acted, great location, interesting storyline.  Could have been tightened up a bit...yet one of my favorite scenes was only available as a Bonus Feature ""deleted scene.""  Some scenes of walking could have been cut to make room for that.  I think the crew was so enamored of the glorious German countryside (yes, it's set in England but was shot in Germany) that they let purely landscapey scenes drag on too much.  Surprisingly bloodless considering what they COULD have done with it.  The few scenes of truly awful violence went by fast and there was no effort to cash in on the current taste for ""torture porn,"" when the setting certainly would have permitted it.

I suppose what I liked most about the movie was that it was, ultimately, thought-provoking.  SPOILER ALERT!

In the end it turns on the idea that an atheist woman living in a swamp fakes magic in order to keep her people under control and safe from the plague.  Safe no matter what, safe at any cost, including becoming as cruel and bloodthirsty as the Catholics whose barbaric god she rejects.  What was dificult about the movie was the paucity of sympathetic characters.  Pretty much everyone was horrible.  Even the innocent, love-struck novice with whom we start the movie becomes a monster by the end.  I think the point was simply that desperate, awful, lethal times have ways of turning everyone--almost everyone--into monsters.  No one is immune.  Not the pious, and not the proto-Stalinists using murder and ""magic"" to try to build a godless paradise in a bog.",1305072000,2,1656,4.881720430107527
4335511,5,B004DY3N9Y,"I remember seeing Black Death's trailer. It gave the feeling that it was an indie budget film with some gore along with a predictable plot; and was using it's medieval sensibilities as an attention-getter and nothing more. Man, oh man, was I ever wrong. Upon watching this film I can safely say that it IS those things, but so much more. Never have I EVER experienced such an intense re-imagining of the dark ages. And dark indeed it is, within Christopher Smith's vision. Several moments within the film will your mouth drop open from the boldness and direction this film is willing to go towards - this film is truly unforgettable.

For better or for worse, the film incorporates gratuitous violence at every turn. This film is INTENDED for a mature audience, who can handle the gore and violence on-screen. Parents, take EXTREME heed to this film's R rating - I would not recommend this movie to children or even early teens due to its extremities of violence.
Yet, if I dare so, it incorporates violence very very well - if such a phrase could be stated about violence. The violence not only carries an external effect, but an emotional one as well. The movie forces each death to give a sort of meaning and sense of desperation that would otherwise be simple fodder in any other typical 'action sequence.' There is a particular scene in which one particular execution, forces the watcher to turn away or pause the film, because it is so powerful and gruesome. If you have seen the film already, no doubt you know which particular death scene I am referring to. All the while the film is keen on delivering disturbing imagery that either forces the audience to gag or stare in wonder. Smith's exemplary film takes its one hour and 40 minute running length and ensures its audience will feel every one of those minutes.

Of special note is the dialogue. Each character, from Edward Redmayne playing as the meek and timid Osmund, to Sean Bean's character, Ulric, are very much distinct and of their own. Each character has diversity; this is displayed from their distinct choice of diction and action to a situation to their fighting styles. Another great plus that adds more flavor and keeps the audience invested in what happens to the characters. I found myself firmly rooted in my seat, and at certain times in a completely state of suspense as to who would make it out of the situation alive.

Black Death also handles smartly the use of plot. At first I predicted a linear story in which the protagonist joins a band of men Lord of the Rings style and roams through marshes and forests and evil, all the while hacking down villains that are clearly in the wrong (actually that does happen in the film). However, within half an hour one suddenly loses all confidence in what will happen. This is especially true near the last half of the film, to which the pacing is superbly executed.

My only gripe? the ending. [light spoiler ahead] While it was conclusive in its own way, it doesn't end with a happy tone at all. It instead asks the reader to question what makes a protagonist 'good,' and what makes the antagonist 'evil.' Which is a topic I refuse to get into because of the religious implications it can give to certain people. Watch the film, and decide for yourself what the final shot of the film was intending to say. All I can say was that for the whopping 1 hour and 40 minutes that it was, I certainly wanted a more conclusive finish.

In case you didn't feel like reading all of the above:

Black death is a great film. It is great because it takes an overly-done genre and forges a completely new identity with it. The acting is top of the line, and the fight sequences are breathtaking as they are terrifying. The plot is well done, and the pacing is so smartly done that the audience is literally on edge in every scene, even though the actual fight sequences are far apart.

At the end of the day, it is a film that stands very well on its own feet and delivers a story that's worth hearing more than once. Just don't bring the kids.

I should start off by saying that but for a few exceptions I have never really liked movies set in the Dark/Mid-evil ages.  This is not a bad movie at all, just a little too slow moving for me.  I was expecting this to be a little more of a horror movie then it was.  The acting is a little flat, but I have seen much worse.  This movie is worth watching, but don't expect anything amazing.

In reality, Black Death is a perfectly adequate film, though it more resembles a well, made-for-tv production. The cast is compiled from a list of unknowns, aside from Bean who is pitch perfect as usual. The rest of the actors and actresses do a great job as well and I honestly have no complaints in that department. The problem for me lies with the plot. Set in England, it more or less revolves around a young monk who gets recruited for a mission alongside Bean and his fellow companions-to travel to a small village where the inhabitants seem to be immune from the deadly disease. The plague does not touch them there and the question is why? So they set off and of course there is danger and surprises and gruesome imagery. It actually gets less interesting as they come upon the village because the plot becomes more contrived and quite predictable and just plain odd. There is a twist too but you may or may not have seen it coming a mile away...

4335518,4,B004DY3N9Y,"It is 1348 and the Black Death is sweeping the English countryside, killing tens of thousands. A young monk, Osmund, has fallen in love with a young girl who has taken refuge in his monastery. His actions lead him to joining a band of the King's men, led by the knight Ulric, on a mission to find a marshland village reputed to be in the grip of witchcraft. Along the way, he hopes to break off and run away with his love. But in the woodlands he finds himself drawn onto a far darker and crueler path.

Black Death is a relatively low-budget movie financed and made in Germany, although the film is in English and has a mostly British cast. It stars Sean Bean as Ulric and Eddie Redmayne - the main character in the recent adaptation of Pillars of the Earth - as Osmund, with veteran actors David Warner (too many roles to list) and Tim McInnery (Blackadder) in support, along with rising star Carice van Houten (noted for recent roles in Black Book, Valkyrie and Repo Men). A bunch of solid supporting actors such as Emun Elliott (soon to be seen in Game of Thrones, along with Bean) and John Lynch (Merlin's father in the BBC series of the same name) line out the relatively small cast.

Given this is a small-budget movie with Sean Bean wearing armour and swinging a sword, the first impression is of a cheesy action flick. Nothing could be further from the truth. Black Death is a surprisingly bleak and dark movie about faith, power and fundamentalism. Sean Bean's Ulric is a far, far cry from his other heroic roles or his out-and-out villains. Instead he's a God-fearing knight who believes absolutely that the Black Death is God's punishment of humanity for its sins. He's a brave and capable warrior, but also utterly unrelenting and ruthless in his quest, capable of killing anyone who gets in his way. Redmayne's Osmund is idealistic and hopeful, shocked by the viciousness of the world and the perchance for violence demonstrated by his new associates.

The film unexpectedly moves into Wicker Man territory when our protagonists reach the supposedly witch-infested town and become engaged in a struggle of faith, reason and power. McInnery is cast against type as the the town headman, with Van Houten as the woman who has brought hope to it. Van Houten is a little too obviously villainous from the off, but her contempt of those who slavishly believe whatever they are told is well-played.

The director, Christopher Smith (best-known for Severance), seems to be aware of the potential for sniggering comparisons to Monty Python and the Holy Grail and with Blackadder, so tackles them head-on. McInnery's casting is possibly one allusion to this, whilst the scene with the monks flagellating themselves as they walk along seems to be a very overt reference to the Grail. Beyond these nods, there is little humour in the film, especially once it moves into its final, dark act.

The film's biggest weakness is that the supposedly wordly wise knights fall a little to easily into a certain and very obvious trap, and whilst the film's focus is commendable in an age of bloated 3D monsters, some side-elements and secondary characters could have done with a bit more fleshing out.

The film's ending is a startling, expectation-destroying sequence. Initially it appears to render the entire film pointless, but on further reflection it raises further questions over corruption and fundamentalism that are surprisingly effective.

Black Death (****) is a dark, bleak and occasionally powerful movie which poses hard questions of its audience. A sometimes uncomfortable watch, this is a far more intelligent and interesting movie than it looks like on first glance.
