1625572,5,B00005MEPC,"Wow!  I saw this video for the first time in the IMAX at the Huntsville U.S Space & Rocket center.  This video gives you a whole new perspective to space flight.  I felt as though I was going to literally float out of my chair.  And, there is an added bonus of having an excellent narratation from Leonard Nimoy.  A must buy!",996796800,16,325,4.17741935483871
1625578,5,B00005MEPC,GREAT!  IMAX movies are wonderful.  I have several of them and love them all.,1207094400,,77,4.428571428571429
1625579,4,B00005MEPC,"DESTINY IN SPACE was an IMAX film released at the height of the NASA's space shuttle program.  The film is narrated by Leonard Nimoy and includes both archived and never before publicly released footage.  The film provides a glimpse of how it is like to live on the space shuttle and the work that American astronauts do in the current age of space exploration.  The film was specifically shot for the IMAX formula so much of the movies grandeur is lost when watching the film on a normal television.  I had an opportunity to watch the film on a screen similar those at a drive-in theatre and was in awe of some of the space shots.  DESTINY IN SPACE has lost some impact over the years because the space shuttle program isn't new anymore, shuttle program is over twenty-five years old now and in another decade a new and different age of space exploration will begin.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching the movie and was reminded of some things we discussed in my elementary and middle school science classes.  Also, the main theme of the film is that humankind has been destined to explore space so when the next age of exploration of the cosmos begins, DESTINY IN SPACE will remain as a tribute of how things were and a reminder that we should keep pressing forward.",1146700800,3,1267,4.579646017699115
1625580,5,B00005MEPC,"My dad just checked this DVD out from the library for the whole family to watch. It was great - the picture, the sound (although it seemed to be too loud for a normal TV set), everything! We learned everything from hoping to discover Mars in the future, to how the Hubble space telescope is repaired...

Best of all, no objectionable content - just pure educational fun! If you have kids that like space so much then watch this DVD.",1118448000,4,432,4.4
1625581,5,B00005MEPC,Destiny in Space is a remarkable production!  I wish I could have seen this in the IMAX theatre but after viewing the DVD version in my home I can say that I truly felt I was floating in space with the astronauts!  The photography is truly astounding and the images of the blue earth below is breathtaking!  The clarity of the images are what is truly spectacular!  The last part of the film shows the Hubble space telescope being released into orbit and it is sight to remember!  Leonard Nimoy's narration is an added extra to this well produced film and for anyone who has an interest in space and our efforts in the space program will find this DVD a worthy investment!  I highly recommend this remarkable film!,1116288000,2,714,4.496124031007752
1625582,3,B00005MEPC,"The film is good and worth having to remind you of the wonder of space travel. Would not recommend watching it on a small screen TV with weak speakers because this movie is meant to be BIG.
Without the size all you're left with is an above average documentary about space.",1101427200,,272,4.352941176470588
1625583,3,B00005MEPC,"This movie is alright. That's it. Just okay. Mediocre. Because of all of the glowing reviews I thought it would be better, so I guess because of my expectations I was let down. I've been looking for a really good movie that shows footage of space and the planets that I could play through my projector at 12 foot wide. But alas, all I continue to get are 20 minutes of astronauts working out or floating around in zero gravity and 10 minutes of footage in space. If anyone has any suggestions for some jaw dropping planetary footage on DVD, please, by all means, let me know. I don't care if it's actual footage or computer generated (as long as it's up to date graphics).
Three stars is fair for this video, but I wouldn't pay over ten dollars for it. This is way over priced for 37 minutes. It's like charging $20,000 dollars for a couple of bolts for the space shuttle. Ridiculous. I'm glad they've started to privatize space flight, maybe we'll actually see some real progress in the field of space exploration. Since NASA doesn't seem to be making any.",1088035200,6,1057,4.481865284974093
1625584,5,B00005MEPC,"I first seen this one at Paramount's Great America in their IMAX theater several years ago.  When I seen this in the stores, I couldn't believe it!  This wasn't the first IMAX movie I've seen.  The first one was Blue Planet, which I highly recommend.  Now, I'm shopping for other IMAX films I've seen in the past.",1068163200,4,313,4.43859649122807
1625585,4,B00005MEPC,"I got both this dvd and ""the dream is alive"" today from Amazon.
I give this one a 4 star only because of the other one which is the best!",1021852800,6,137,3.6
1625586,5,B00005MEPC,"This amazing dvd has one of the crispiest images I've ever seen. Filmed using IMAX cameras, only the digital media of the dvd can truly live up to it. Through more than 50 minutes, the apacible music and the soothing voice of Leonard Nemoy's take you trhough a journey of the metaphisical. Learn how the Space Shuttle deploys satellites, what it may take for us to go to other planets, or simply relax and hold your breath at the many sights of earth from 400 KM above ground. If you are into space, this one is a must!",1011830400,13,519,4.3061224489795915
1625587,5,B00005MEPC,Excellent near Earth orbit photography plus great CGI of Martian and Venerian topography. Shots of the shuttle and various satellites the best!,1007164800,7,143,5.545454545454546
7945526,5,B00005MEPC,"I love this DVD and I Lenard Nemoy (Spok from Star Trek) is the narrator.  It is an actually IMAX film that played at Kennedy Space Center for several years.  I am a Tour Guide and often go to Kennedy Space Center and I use this film while going for the 1 hour to get there.

Part of the film is history as to what has been accomplished, what is being done now, and what the future hold for space exploration.",1451779200,,409,4.0246913580246915

7945531,3,B00005MEPC,This dvd was too short and had little informative information. Wouldn't waste the money or time on it. Was not impressed with IMAX either.,1382572800,,138,4.791666666666667
7945532,5,B00005MEPC,"In this movie, we join Space Shuttle astronauts as we ask the all important question about manned spaceflight: Can humans live and work in space for long periods of time?

Like a previous NASA IMAX film, The Dream is Alive, a lot of the footage was taken on various Shuttle missions, this time during the late 80s and early 90s. We join the crew of a mission to carry the Spacelab module into orbit to perform science experiments in microgravity. Or watch along as another Shuttle deploys the Galileo spacecraft bound for Jupiter. Or the unique sight of the Space Shuttle itself in orbit filmed from the SPAS platform (not so common before the International Space Station made views like it commonplace).

This film also includes ponderings of what it might be like to explore other planets. We ride along as we see the terrain of Venus and Mars (although the computer-generated graphics look pretty dated today).

But what about beyond our Solar System? The last part of the film shows the deployment of the famous Hubble Space Telescope. Unfortunately, it was launched with a flawed mirror. We see the first Shuttle mission to visit Hubble in orbit to correct the problems. Today all of the amazing photographs of the Universe taken by Hubble are taken for granted. But without the efforts of NASA and the astronauts shown in this film, that would have never been possible.

Narrated by Leonard Nimoy, aside from the obvious Star Trek connection, does a fine job telling the story of the film.

Definitely recommended for space nerds.",1298160000,,1536,4.82509505703422
7945533,5,B00005MEPC,"I have been looking forward to seeing this completed movie since I saw the unedited raw footage at the IMAX theater at the Ontario place during ISDC1994. It does not disappoint. One of the design problems of the IMAX camera is that it can only hold an 8minute film magazine, so the amateur cinematographers with NASA have to be judicious in what they film. As always, they exceed expectations.
The movie is also a sort of history lesson. We have become so used to the enormous size of the ISS, that we now take its expanse for granted It is hard to remember that there was a time when the Spacelab was our Space Station. Today, we use similar sized modules as cargo containers to the Station.
This film is an excellent introduction to spaceflight",1269216000,,746,4.533333333333333
7945534,5,B00005MEPC,Excellent DVD! I bought it for a child with asperger's autism who absolutely loves space and he got a big kick out of it. We are also going to use it in his 4th grade science class where we are currently studying the solar system.,1265587200,,230,4.133333333333334
7945535,4,B00005MEPC,"Destiny In Space (IMAX) (1994) was at least a full four star IMAX production that provided colorful razor sharp documentation of the Space Shuttle, MIR Space Station, SPACELAB, the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), the HUBBLE Telescope and much more. A good value at under $10.00 from Amazon and full of extra features.

In addition, wonderful computer animations of the landscapes of Venus and Mars were ""filmed"" from an orbital perspective and presented based on detailed radar imaging. Although this film was narrated by Leonard Nimoy I had difficulty hearing his calm voice behind the sound track and music.",1238371200,,617,5.232323232323233
