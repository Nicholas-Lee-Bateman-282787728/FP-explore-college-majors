5109758,5,B007SZD69M,"Excellent Pilates DVD for Older Folks, People with Pain Issues, and Travelers.  I am definitely in the ""target market"" for this Pilates video.  It is geared towards folks over the age of 50, people dealing with pain management issues, and frequent travelers. The video lasts about 70 minutes and Jennifer does a great job of explaining every exercise down to the tiniest detail.  It can be used by brand new beginners to Pilates or folks that have done Pilates for years because she explains and demonstrates the easiest and most challenging way to do each exercise. She is very careful to point out which exercises may be too difficult for some people and therefore helps them to avoid any strains or injuries.

The video is broken up into segments of: 1) Warm-Up, 2) Mat Exercises with Props, 3) Mat Exercises Without Props, and 4) Stretches.  I like that you can jump to each segment from the main screen and bypass what you don't want to watch.  This allows you to take the 70 minute video and make yourself a 10, 20, or 30 minute workout. It is clear that Jennifer is a highly trained and certified Professional.  I see in her bio that she is a trainer for other Pilates Instuctors as well as has her own studio of private clients in LA.  It is clearly demonstrated by her instructional method in the video.

I ordered on Monday and received it on Friday.  Very pleased with the quality and shipping.

Highly recommended!",1334880000,7,1426,4.619047619047619

I could not do many of the exercises and in fact, some are in conflict with what my physical therapist told me to do or not do. I am happy that others with pain found this video helpful, but it did not help me. On a plus side, she did describe the exercises well, so I like her technique. I will donate the CD to my local library; perhaps someone else may benefit from it.",1402790400,2,524,4.0
8521701,5,B007SZD69M,"I am very much a beginner and while I haven't been able to do everything yet, the program is so well explained and organized that I'm able to do more each time I do it. My favorite part is that because Jennifer shows different levels of most of the moves, the program works for my much more advanced daughter too so she can do the program right along with me. This is just what I needed to get moving again and alleviate my daily pain.",1395705600,,435,4.129411764705883
8521702,5,B007SZD69M,Jennifer Kutch's DVD was very thorough and specific in showing stretches and exercises to help me with my back pain and stretching my hip flexors.  Jennifer had excellent camera vantage points to show exactly how to do the movements and to avoid injury.  She is obviously very knowledgable in both Pilates and pain management.,1390176000,,326,5.018518518518518

8521704,5,B007SZD69M,"After purchasing several different pilates videos in the past, with different instructors, I hesitated to order this one, thinking it might be like the rest, however, I'm EXTREMELY glad I did.  This far exceeds the others I've purchased in the past.  This DVD is well targated toward all ages; it's not only great for the body, but it's great for the mind as well, it's a smooth, detailed and easy to follow video.  The calming effect it has on me has made it easy to stay focused on the importance of the exercise itself.  Looking forward to the next one.",1356825600,2,556,4.53
8521705,4,B007SZD69M,"This DVD provides very thorough instruction regarding pilates exercises and positions.  It is also something you can take with you when you travel.

8521706,5,B007SZD69M,"About 10 years ago, I took a Pilates mat class, hurt my neck, and gave it up. However, after taking classes with Jennifer, I am now a believer again. She is a gentle, but very effective teacher...gives options and makes it fun also. I highly recommend this video and know that if a person does what she says, they will feel much better !!!!!

8521707,5,B007SZD69M,"This is easy to follow and extremely well done.  Although at 71 I cannot do ALL of the advanced moves, I can definitely get an excellent workout. Jennifer explains things very well and the photography shows different views, so that I know what is happening.  I love her reminders to ""breathe"" and ""think of an ice pick"" which immediately get my attention. Thanks, Jennifer.",1337212800,5,373,4.8125
8521708,5,B007SZD69M,Great pilates dvd!  I love the selection of exercises and how Jennifer explains what to do to increase or decrease the difficulty for a customized workout.  It has a nice flow to it with plenty of helpful camera angles and close up shots to keep you focused on the details of the movements.  Jennifer's verbal cues keep you thinking about proper form throughout and the steady pace makes me confident I'll workout with this dvd over and over.,1336521600,4,442,4.641025641025641
8521709,5,B007SZD69M,Wow! Fantastic Pilates video. It's already helping my wife alleviate some nagging back pain. Jennifer is a fresh new face in the crowded world of workout videos. We have been looking for the perfect workout for our lifestyle and this is it.  We have just started watching the DVD but it is already becoming a huge part of our weekly routine.
