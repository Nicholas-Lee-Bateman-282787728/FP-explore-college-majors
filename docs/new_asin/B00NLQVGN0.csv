6667165,5,B00NLQVGN0,"We saw this group in concert in San Francisco in April 2015, after having seen them on the Classic Arts Showcase channel, and having heard and enjoyed the Heute Nacht oder Nie CD for some years.  They did not disappoint.  There's no group who can sound like 80 or 90 years ago jazz.  Max Raabe's compositions are good, though he's still got a little way to go to equal some of the 1920s--30s compositions. Still, perhaps it's just familiarity on my part that's lacking, and I really do love this group.  They are quite accomplished as musicians and as showmen and women.",1431734400,,570,4.5588235294117645
6667166,3,B00NLQVGN0,"This DVD does not do justice to Max Raabe and his Palast Orchester, whose performances are brilliant, as usual.  The audio quality is excellent, and captures the acoustic ambience of the Admiralspalast in a pleasing manner.  The video quality is simply bizarre.  Some tracks are in a 2.35 (approx) aspect ratio, while others are in the usual widescreen 16:9.  The entire production seems overexposed, with washed-out colors and a murky look, almost like cigarette smoke.  The attempts at being creative, with some tracks in black and white, rapid cutaways and variable screen dissolve techniques, are very distracting and annoying.  I think these problems must the the fault of the Deutsche Grammophon production team.  Compare this with Raabe's ""Heute Nacht oder Nie"", filmed in the same venue, which is a far superior video production. I suggest being more patient than I was, and waiting for a possible Blu Ray release, which may or may not correct these defects.  And no, there are no English subtitles, as noted by the other reviewer.",1429315200,2,1039,5.070588235294117
6667167,2,B00NLQVGN0,"Max Raabe has been a long time favorite of mine. I already have two of his DVD's. So when I saw this new one I immediately ordered it. What a disappointment. Amazon's write up on the DVD says it's in English. So does the DVD itself. BUT IT IS NOT! Every time Raabe speaks he talks in German. And there are no subtititles either. I feel cheated. Amazon should do something before they continue marketing this product. And if any of you want to buy it, you have been warned. I could return it but it's such a hassle to do.",1425081600,9,520,4.158415841584159
