8574850,3,B00BWU1EOS,"It should be noted that this was the final live monthly PPV for TNA as they would scale back their live PPV schedule to only 3 (Lockdown, Slammiversary, Bound For Glory) while doing the rest of the events as special editions of Impact & monthly pre-taped themed PPV's under the ""One Night Only"" series.  Also on this show was a segment between Brooke Hogan & Bully Ray to put over their upcoming wedding on Impact as well.

Tag Team Champions Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Joey Ryan & Matt Morgan - A rematch from the previous Final Resolution PPV that started off that saw Joey Ryan constantly showing off & not taking matters as seriously as his partner that kept allowing Chavo & Hernandez to get the advantage to the point where Morgan had to keep tagging himself in to get the advantage back for his team only for Ryan to keep tagging himself back in & losing the advantage.  This was one of those matches that was more about pushing a storyline than anything else which was the issues between Morgan & Ryan.

Samoa Joe vs. Mr. Anderson - Samoa Joe wanted an answer to weather Anderson was aligned with Aces & Eights while Anderson refused to give an answer leading to this match here with Joe starting out very aggressive just beating on Anderson non-stop in & out of the ring while yelling ""ANSWER ME!"" until Anderson was able to take advantage of his surroundings to get some momentum working over a part of Joe's body that was clearly hurt to the point where he showed signs of it while executing his own offense.  This was an average match that only served the purpose of continuing the mystery of if Anderson was a member of Aces & Eights.

Christian York vs. Kenny King - This was the finals of an X Division contenders tournament with the winner facing the champion right after the match as the action starting off with both men trading slaps before York was able to gain the advantage with various chops & dropkicks along with a head scissors takedown off the apron before King was able to come back showcasing various offense in either strength such as muscling up York for a rock bottom or aerial with a reverse top rope crossbody.  This was a good match between both men but had an aftermath with the loser taking his aggression out on the winner setting up...

X Division Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Christian York - ...this match right after with York in even worse condition from the post-match attack to the point where RVD attempted to reason with York that he didn't have to compete only for York to slap him as the match had RVD in control with his trademark offense of using his educated feet along with some impactful moves & stretches only for York to not only keep kicking out despite RVD yelling for him to stay down but also keep hanging with RVD & even got some close pin attempts on him as well.  This match told a real good story of York being an underdog & not 100% yet still took everything the champion threw at him & even gave RVD a run for his money as the two matches here really put over York as a strong babyface for the division.

Television Champion Devon vs. Joseph Park - This was Park's first match since he was officially ""trained"" with Devon constantly taunting him & showing that he wasn't taking Park seriously until Park was able to get some quick moves in on him & keep catching Devon off guard causing Devon to get more serious in his attack on Park including taking a shortcut that caused Park not to bleed but showcase a reaction that we've seen from his brother in the past.  This was one of those matches where you'll enjoy it if you understand the story they were telling about Park still being inexperienced to the point where you saw he was clearly nervous & having second thoughts on some of the offense he performed.

Knockouts Gauntlet Match: Gail Kim vs. Brooke Tessmacher vs. O.D.B. vs. Mickie James vs. Velvet Sky - This was to determine the #1 contender for Tara's Knockout Championship that saw various highlights such as Gail & Tessmacher renewing their old rivalry with hard they were going at it against each other, where the match with O.D.B. started, the hardest we've seen Mickie James work in a while, and when it got down to the final two including the issues one participant kept having with the referee Taryn Terrell.  This was one of the best knockouts matches in a while due to how hard some of the knockouts (including one who was the M.V.P. of the match) worked while Taz did have some funny lines on commentary that I couldn't help but laugh at from time to time.

James Storm vs. Christopher Daniels - This match had a special stipulation with the winner getting a TNA Championship match on a future episode of Impact while Kazarian was Daniels' manager for the match complete with a ""manager's license.""  Storm started out in control taking the match both in & outside the ring before Kaz had to cause a distraction allowing Daniels to take back the advantage in the ring working over Storm's arm while Kaz would then get physically involved on the outside.  Very good match with both men trading momentum & Kaz adding to the match playing the ""old school"" heel manager role as well.

Sting vs. D.O.C. - Sting came out brawling on the outside before the match even started all the way to the Aces & Eights entrance to the point where D.O.C. had to use help to regain control for a moment while also avoiding whenever Sting attempted to use the Scorpion Deathdrop.  This match served the purpose of Sting returning against the man who put him out for weeks but was pretty short & sweet past that & the aftermath where he had help when the rest of Aces & Eights appeared.

Elimination Match: TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Austin Aries vs. Bobby Roode - Jeff Hardy came into this match as the odd man out as Aries & Roode already revealed that they made a deal to work together as a team to take out Hardy which was showcased throughout the match with both men working him over together & take away his daredevil offense by keeping him grounded causing Hardy to use different strategies such as hit & run on both men or single out one man at a time which was able to keep Hardy one step ahead of both men at times including using one to execute offense on the other while capitalizing on moments of miscommunication between Roode & Aries as well.  This was a very good main event with the story of the match playing out perfectly.

In the end, this was one of those events that didn't have a bad unwatchable match on it as there was some average & solid to really good wrestling but didn't have a match that was very memorable or worth going out of your way to watch as this was more about continuing storylines more than anything else so it's a solid event that I would recommend to steam or rent.",1438992000,,6776,4.46160064672595
