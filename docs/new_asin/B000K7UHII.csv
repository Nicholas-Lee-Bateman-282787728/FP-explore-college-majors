8166257,2,B000K7UHII,"This movie is fine if you're interested in this era of New York City, which is mostly the reason I watched it. But as a movie, on it's own, it's not great. The character of Elaine is somewhat interesting, but the story itself isn't great. It's sort of stuck in a limbo between a regular crime/mystery/comedy and exploitation and camp. Unfortunately it doesn't have enough of either to be really noteworthy. It is good enough to watch if you're interested in the era, though. Definitely don't watch it for Debbie Harry, I think she had one line!",1505692800,,544,4.618556701030927
8166258,5,B000K7UHII,"This film brings back the best of memories -- in a New York city that has long past.  Simple plot, retro vibes, i give a huge thumbs up for this feel good wrinkle in time.",1472428800,,171,3.8857142857142857
8166259,1,B000K7UHII,Definitely a low budget movie.. I guess special effects weren't very Special back in 1987. I think  most everyone involved in the making of this movie tried really hard to produce a decent movie ...unfortunately...it wasn't. Not sure who the slacker was...,1456617600,,256,5.095238095238095
8166260,1,B000K7UHII,"This film is a pastiche of New York scenes and actions. Several characters involved which never created any empathy from this  viewer.
The best elements of the film are the New York City real shot scenery.",1419292800,,205,4.694444444444445
8166261,1,B000K7UHII,"Gave up after about 10 minutes.
Its free, but a waste of time.
Did not even get to Baldwin's part.",1398556800,,98,3.95
8166262,1,B000K7UHII,"this movie is really a waste of time, it shows Debbie Harry only in passing (the cover implies she is ""Lulu"") it's the story of a desperately poor artist in New York. I have a high tolerance for BS movies but I just couldn't finish this one. the stars should be negative.",1378425600,2,271,4.230769230769231
8166263,3,B000K7UHII,"The 3 stars are for seeing Alec in a cop uniform, which you'll need to skip most of the movie to find...",1366675200,2,104,3.772727272727273
8166264,1,B000K7UHII,"This DVD was apparently produced by somebody at home on their computer. Label on the disc was definitely homemade. Picture quality is fuzzy; it may have been copied from a VHS tape. Sound is muffled at times. One scene skipped. Besides that, the storyline is predictable and the acting of the main actress is contrived and horrible. Very much a high school project feeling. Deborah Harry is barely in it and has little to no speaking parts. Alec Baldwin must have been just starting out in his career or suffered through the bad script as a favor to a friend. Even if these actors are your favorites, I would skip this movie and pretend it was never part of their career.",1197244800,3,671,4.553719008264463
