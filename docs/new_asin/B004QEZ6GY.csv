8438083,4,B004QEZ6GY,"I've seen Colin many times in some of the many CC dvd's I have. I have been fascinated by them for well over a decade and he clarified that some of the ""good"" ones may be human made and what reasons that went down for them. The Incredible ones (MIlk HIll Aug 2001, with 409 circles over 1000 feet wide, and perfect) all but proves that Some of them are made by Beings way beyond our evolution. Where ""They"" come from (or ""reach in"" from) is a fun but serious mystery which is open to everyone interested. I gave the program 4 stars only because I knew much of everything Colin brought out in his fine discussion. That we are being contacted via the CC's-- to me-- is not even a question. That They do many of ""them"" in grain crops is amusing but logical, as the grain ends up being more fortified w/ nutrients. Too bad the ""visitors""-- we humans-- going into the postCC fields have done such damage, antagonizing the farmer/owners. Not all visitors, but some. That this amazing phemon is going down mostly in England ( & near Stonehenge, Avebury, Silbury HIll) doesn't surprise me so much. The Ancients (I think They are) have been here before, watching us evolve on this living Being we call Earth. AND I'm thinking, They're not too impressed w/ our social, political and economic systems. Don't blame them. War, violence, terror still are too popular and now are ""entertainment"" as well. Naked breasts are ""evil"" but automatic weapons shredding someone aren't... What's wrong w/ this picture? The Brit Gov't/Military denying their obsessive interest in the CC's was also amusing.. but that's been going on a LONG time as well. What's a bigger hoot- it's illegal to make a CC in Jolly Ol' but ""they"" keep showing up every summer.... No UFO's or Aliens have been detained/ arrested. Yet.",1366761600,,1787,4.640378548895899
8438084,5,B004QEZ6GY,"PLEASE BUY & VIEW ""CONSCIOUS CIRCLES,"" WHICH HAS EXCELLENT PRESENTATION BY AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER, COLIN ANDREWS, IN THE FIELD OF CROP CIRCLES, DESIGNS, ACTUALLY, USUALLY IN CROPS.  HE PRESENTS MUCH INFO UNAVAILABLE IN OTHER RESOURCES.  NEVER BORING, & ANY MUSIC IS NOT TOO LOUD SO THE WORDS ARE AUDIBLE.",1346630400,2,305,5.204081632653061
8438085,4,B004QEZ6GY,"As another reviewer mentioned, this lecture was filmed in the ""Buddha Barn,""  a cozy, wood-beamed ""community room"" near Colin Andrews' small Connecticut farm.  Speaking before an intimate, sympathetic gathering, Andrews sums up in about two hours the results of his thirty-plus years investigating crop circles and related paranormal phenomena.  Andrews supplements his comments with numerous slides, charts, and video clips.

For Andrews, crop circles - both ""hoaxed"" and ""real"" - are part of a larger change in consciousnes which Andrews sees as essential to the betterment (and even survival) of the human race.  The phenomenon thus has enormous social and political implications.

Andrews relates events happening over many years in certain areas of England, and attempts to tie them together in a broad synthesis, a coherent, unfolding drama, as it were, a progressive ""revelation.""

But, one might ask, a revelation from whom, or what? And how much of that revelation is explicit, and how much comes from our own psychological needs or projections?  Thorny questions, indeed.

Andrews derides those crop circle fanatics who insist that few - if any - of the beautifully complex circles are human creations, and rightfully warns against their religious zeal and disregard for demonstrable facts.  Yet it is clear that the circles also have a religious significance for Andrews, and that should also give pause.  I have considerable respect for Andrews as a man of integrity and good will, but I cannot follow him all the way in some of his views.  One rather jarring note - for me - was Andrews' apparent belief in the authenticity of an alleged message from a space being named Vrillon, an apocalyptic message which mysteriously cut into a British television broadcast back in the 1970s.  This message is widely considered a sophisticated hoax, yet Andrews takes it at face value.

So there is material in this lecture that will ""raise eyebrows,"" to use a journalistic cliche, material that will strike many as either unbelieveable, dubious, or even ridiculous.  So be it.  I nonetheless recommend this DVD as something like a visit with an old friend, a charming friend who is always good company but whose views we might not share in their entirety.  Andrews thinks he has finally found some answers to the crop circle mystery, and he discerns a clear and portentious message emanating from the phenomenon.  I do not share that belief, but I do believe that the circles are a mystery, and that the modern world's smug certainties can certainly stand a little shaking.",1341619200,3,2575,5.105011933174224
8438086,5,B004QEZ6GY,"The format is a seminar/classroom but in a warm setting, at the ""Buddha Barn"" in Massachusetts, actually a warm, homey setting for Mr. Andrews to deliver his personal take on a world phenomenon. He manages to isolate the subject in one region near Sussex, England, and to tell a very credible story, with a very compelling timeline, with crystal clear slides and diagrams.

The third part of the surveillance, if you will, is British government (interestingly, the former employer of Andrews). This Reviewer was floored to learn that a ""crop circle"" formed on royal property - how could hoaxters possibly penetrate that area? Where did the design originate?

Another fascinating detail here is a discussion of those two crop circle originators, who around 1979, took credit for the early circles; what the viewer will find as ""new"" is the real impetus for such an endeavour.

A big impetus for me to buy this DVD was the idea that it contained that well-known radio broadcasting live on-air ""break-in"" of a ""voice from space"". I'd seen that a few times a while back on a TV Documentary I've been searching for ever since. What is contained herein is a BBC TELEVISION encounter, which is much longer. And in the same relatively small georgraphic area. I won't spill the beans. Check it out for yourself.

The speaker weaves it all together, bringing in Science, Higher Mathematics,  Philosophy, Astrology, and Media.

This is a keeper.",1323993600,7,1434,4.929460580912863
