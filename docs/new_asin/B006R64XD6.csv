If you're not into breeding and color morph genetics, it gets old quick. I don't know if Herpers II & III are just more of the same.",1432771200,,261,4.458333333333333

8503472,5,B006R64XD6,"IMO this video is a 'must have' for anyone that keeps reptiles. Its great for those just starting to keep reptiles because it opens up a whole new world the the Herping hobby/passion. For those that have been Herpers for a while its fun to watch and may even show you some things you didn't know or didn't realize the scope of some of the aspects of the Herping community. This is not an instructional or a 'how to' for keeping reptiles. This video takes you out in the field ""Herping"", to a major reptile show, talks with some of the breeders of reptiles, shows you what some of us do for fun ( Herpetological Society and Ren Fest ) and many other things. Get this video, you won't regret it. Thanks to Dav and his crew for making this film !! And check out Herpers 2 !!",1332201600,,771,4.216216216216216
8503473,5,B006R64XD6,"I thought it was very good. If you know anybody that likes snakes, lizards, frogs, and stuff like that then this would be good for them. It is good for for anybody nothing too bad. Has a lot of people that are somewhat famous in the reptile community. Helps people find out more about breeding and keeping herps and its enjoyable. It may be a little boring to a person thats young with a small attention span.",1329004800,,409,4.324675324675325
