8539671,4,B009CSVQAE,"This is experimental/avant-garde filmmaking at its best. Gutsy, envelope-pushing storytelling and acting. And I think the risks pay off. (As for the reviewer who thinks only people from ""American ghettos"" might relate - I suggest you stick to Jerry Bruckheimer flicks. Global arthouse cinema is not for you, if you can only relate to films from your tiny neck of the world.)",1454284800,,374,5.048387096774194

8539673,3,B009CSVQAE,A brave attempt by Q. Some parts of the movie was very tiresome but none the less Horihor - nara nara,1364947200,,101,3.857142857142857
8539674,3,B009CSVQAE,"It's hard to judge Gandu since it deals with the trials of a young man searching for an identity in India, a rather foreign experience for someone who grew up in mainstream America.  So it's difficult to form any connection with the characters.  I suppose someone who grew up in an American ghetto could form a bond with them.  The film is quite graphic with explicit, on-screen fellatio.",1361232000,2,388,4.676470588235294
8539675,5,B009CSVQAE,"I had the pleasure of watching Gandu in 2011 at the Starz Denver Film Festival, it was easily the most impressive and audacious movie not only there but probably anywhere else in recent memory.  The film really mixes it up in regard to tone and style, which of course can be off-putting to common viewers, but in my opinion it was exceedingly fresh, something that could be built on in today's contemporary film environment and what one might expect from a director that's not content to just follow traditions yet still has a firm grasp on filmmaking and how to create a vibrant and beautiful picture.  It's very radical, anyone with a taste for cult and super progressive cinema would probably relish this, I for one am glad to see it released in DVD format, it fully deserves it.  Too bad it didn't get the theatrical release it deserved, I used to work in the art house circuit as a projectionist through the 90's and this would have been a huge hit.",1358208000,,954,4.534883720930233
