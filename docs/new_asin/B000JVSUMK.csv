8153342,2,B000JVSUMK,"I can put up with low budget movies. With a title like Treasure of Lust you would expect some sexual situations, and a lot of nudity, you don't get that here, although there are a couple of bare breasts in one scene. The acting isn't bad, but it isn't good either. There is a lot of arguing at the beginning, that put me off, it was unnecessary. The plot is easy to follow, but the movie is poorly done. The 3 main characters are women with weird powers, but they only use them once. Then there are 2 double crosses at the end. If you are looking for titillation you won't find it here. Unless you are a fan of B movies there is no reason to watch this, it isn't worth a nickel. (I did not purchase or rent this from Amazon, I got it from another source) As bad as this  movie is, I can not see anyone, even a die hard fan,  paying what is being asked for this movie.",1506470400,,867,4.005780346820809
