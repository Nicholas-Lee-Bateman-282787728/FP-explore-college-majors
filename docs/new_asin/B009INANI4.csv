5340464,5,B009INANI4,"Holy s*** what a great PPV I usually don't have this much fun watching a wwe ppv anymore, but boy did this one deliver ! Great first outing by the shield. Worth your money.",1357430400,,172,4.088235294117647
5340465,3,B009INANI4,"Tables Match: Rey Mysterio & Sin Cara vs. Team Rhodes Scholars - The tables came into play in the early moments with Rey & Cara using one as a battery ram into both Cody & Damien while also sticking to their high flying offense such as a crossbody & springboard armdrag before later executing holds like head scissors that took down one while the other over the top.  Cody & Damien tried to utilize the tactic of ""divide & conquer"" as they worked over Cara's leg using the ringside steps & table while keeping Rey away either by tossing him into barricades or off the apron.  This was a good match with Rhodes & Sandow really working well as a team with some even the comedic reactions from the crowd & Twitter in regards to Cody's ""ravishing"" mustache.

United States Champion Antonio Cesaro vs. R-Truth - Both men started off trading momentum as Cesaro worked a slower grounded offense such as a hammerlock/chinlock combination while Truth also worked a ground game with a headlock before getting quicker with his offense with pin attempts along with his trademark axe kick & spinning forearm.  I'll say this was Cesaro's most competitive PPV match to date but unfortunately ended before they really had a chance to build up to something due an injury by Truth.

Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston vs. Wade Barrett - Barrett made his intentions clear early on in that his strategy was to take away Kofi's arial offense by first trying to ground then kicking his legs out from under him while also using some power offense like a pumphandle slam & a top rope elbow of his own as Kofi was still able to hit some offense like a suicide dive & still to use his speed against Wade resulting a good back & forth match but really nothing different than we haven't already seen from their matches in recent weeks.

T.L.C. Match: Ryback & Team Hell No vs. The Shield - This was the first T.L.C. match (but not the first ladder match) where you can win by pinfall & submission and you saw exactly how this match was going to go when all the teams started brawling on the floor the moment The Shield made their way to ringside.  There were plenty of hard hits & falls as expected in this type of match like one man sandwitched in between a ladder with a chair striking it, a DDT on a chair, a double suplex onto a ladder, a powerbomb through a table, a double suplex from a table setup on the top turnbuckle & Kane's top rope clothesline from that same table that turned one of The Shield inside out, a spear through the barricade before being buried underneath everything in sight, Daniel Bryan doing a ""NO Lock"" to everyone in sight, a curb stomp onto an open chair, and a dangerous fall off a ladder through tables.  This was definitely a highlight performance for everyone involved as Kane & Ryback were made to look like monsters, Daniel Bryan came off like a little pitbull who kept bringing the fight, and The Shield looked like a tight unit who kept using the strategy of trying to single out one person for double & triple teaming.

Divas Champion Eve Torres vs. Naomi - Outside of Naomi showing some athleticism & Eve attempting to work over her arm, this was too short to have any relevance with the only purpose it served was Eve screwing Kaitlyn out of the match on the pre-show battle royal earlier in the night.

Chairs Match: World Champion Big Show vs. Sheamus - Both of these men weren't able to touch each other for weeks so they went at right away at the start of the match with Sheamus taking Show's leg out & keeping him down before they went to the outside with Show trying to avoid Sheamus the moment he got a chair only to still eventually get hit & be on the receiving end of scoop slam & flying shoulderblock with a chair.  Show was able to regain the advantage when he caught Sheamus with a mid-air spear before slowing down the pace & beat down on Sheamus including executing a Vader Bomb sandwitching Sheamus between chairs & the mat but Sheamus kept fighting as they were able to exchange some hard hits like White Noise on open chairs, Show's KO punch, and the biggest chairshot you've ever seen in your life...literally.  This was my favorite out of their series so far as not only did it come off as a fight but they used the chairs in unique ways.

The Miz, Alberto Del Rio, Brooklyn Brawler vs. 3MB - This was setup through an episode of MizTV earlier in the night with Del Rio in the unfamiliar (and to be honest, awkward) role of fan favorite in what was nothing more than a quick six man tag, with even Ricardo getting involved, just to pop the Brooklyn crowd for the appearance of the Brooklyn Brawler while the commentators got all the jokes they could possibly could in regards to Brawler's history in the WWE.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: John Cena vs. Dolph Ziggler - This is the first time since 2010 that this was the third Money In The Bank ladder match within an calendar year while these two were the winners of the previous two at the PPV earlier this year while it should also be noted that this was a very anti-Cena/pro-Ziggler crowd.  Cena was in control early & used some offense that we hadn't seen from him before (or in a very long time) like a monkey flip out of the corner on Dolph that caused him to resort to weapons like using a chair before Cena retailed using the ladder & steel steps with a table being brought into play as well.  Both men gave out punishment as much as they gave it throughout the match like when Dolph applied a sleeper while Cena continued to climb to the top of the ladder before the hold was eventually ""broken"" in a way that ended up hurting both guys, Cena pulling out a frankensteiner on Dolph into a table, and Dolph being able to counter the A.A. multiple times either by using a chair or into moves like a DDT or Zig Zag.  Vickie Guerrero eventually made her presence which eventually lead to the sexiest John Cena offense I've ever seen (just watch to see what I'm talking about) before something happened that just shocked everyone involved in the match.  This was advertised as a Ladder Match but evolved into a T.L.C. Match with all of those weapons coming into play which benefited the match as Cena gives a better performance during these ""no rules"" contest, Dolph continued to give the performance he's been known for years, and everyone else involved only added to the contest instead of distracting from it.

In the end, the best matches in this PPV were the ones that fit the name of the PPV (tag team tables match, ladder match, T.L.C. match, chairs match) but there also wasn't a bad match on here past the divas so it's one worth checking out.",1356566400,3,6649,4.462108731466228

5340468,5,B009INANI4,"On the 4th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...WWE TLC 2012. The tag team Tables match between the team of Sin Cara & Rey Mysterio Jr. against Team Rhodes Scholars(Cody Rhodes & Damian Sandow) had nice high-flying(from Sin Cara & Rey Mysterio),solid brawling(from Rhodes & Sandow) and I love Rhodes Scholars's creative uses of the tables themselves.  The United States title match between Antonio Cesaro & R-Truth was not great but pretty good. The Intercontinental title match between Kofi Kingston & Wade Barrett was a back-and-forth,hard-hitting bout. The 6 man Tables,Ladders & Chairs match between The Shield against the team of Ryback,Daniel Bryan & Kane was a ruthless,extreme,aggressive slobber-knocker. The Divas title match between Eve Torres & Naomi was short but still entertaining. The Chairs match for the Worlds title between Sheamus & The Big Show was slow yet savage & nail-biting. The Bonus 6 man tag team match between 3MB against the team of The Miz,Alberto Del Rio & The Brooklyn Brawler was good for a 6 man tag match even though it was rushed at best. The Money in the Bank ladder match between John Cena & Dolph Ziggler was a combative,entertaining & fun bout with a twist ending  of A.J. turning on Cena to boot. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1355702400,6,1276,4.821917808219178

Tables Match for the #1 Contendership for the Tag Titles
Team Rhodes Scholars v. Rey Mysterio & Sin Cara  3.3/5
- Nice opener here. The Scholars win after a sick spot where Sin Cara was pushed into a table outside the ring.

United States Championship
Antonio Cesaro(c) v. R-Truth  2.6/5
- An alright here, Cesaro gets the win and retains the U.S. Championship

Intercontiental Championship
Kofi Kingston(c) v. Wade Barrett  3/5

Tables, Ladders, and Chairs Match, either win by Pinfall or Submission
""The Shield"" Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns v. ""Team Hell No"" Daniel Bryan, Kane, and Ryback  4.5/5
- This match was phenomenal, maybe the match of the year(2012)! The Shield's debut match on the main roster. And it delivered. You have six great athletes(yes, Ryback too) went out there and put on a hell of a match. Should of maybe closed the show, but ts waddevs. The Shield won the match after powerbombing Bryan threw the table. Go out if your way to watch this one. Crazy, crazy spots.

DIva's Championship
Eve(c) v. Naomi 2/5
- Welp, Eve retains the Diva's title.

Chairs Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Big Show(c) v. Sheamus  3.3/5
- These two guys have actually put on good matches with eachother. Suprising, I know. Big Show wins after a shot from a huge chair.

3MB v. The Miz, Brooklyn Brawler, and Alberto Del Rio (w/ Ricardo Rodriguez) 2.4/5
- Nice seeing the Brooklyn Brawler, decent match up here.

Ladder Match for Dolph Ziggler's Money in the Bank Briefcase
Dolph Ziggler v. John Cena  4.2/5
- Great main event here, Ziggler always main eventing a show is great. Some really cool spots in this one. I rather enjoyed this match. Ziggler beating the face of the WWE was fantastic, Also was nice seeing AJ cost Cena the match and turning heel. Another thing is that superkick from Ziggler was awesome. Ziggler defeats Cena and keeps his MITB Briefcase.

TLC 2012

This event would turn out to be one of my favorites from 2012 as there were great moments throughout the night. From tag matches to the gimmick matches there was something for everyone here. Of course the match I was looking forward to the most was The Shield finally mixing it up in there. Also I knew the main event would be great because Ziggler was in there and Cena always delivers when he is in there with someone like Ziggler.

1.[TABLES MATCH]REY MYSTERIO & SIN CARA VS RHODES SCHOLARS-great opening match right here as two good tag teams go at it for a shot at the tag titles. Scholars remind me of old school classic heel teams and Rey & Cara are just excellent. This was a fun match with Rey and Cara starting strong using the table as a weapon. But the Scholars would fight back taking control working over Cara most of the time. The high flyers would try to come back from that but it would be that style of offense that would cost them. Sin Cara would attempt a springboard only to be shoved in the air out onto a table thus giving Rhodes Scholars the win. Also I love that the crowd was chanting ""Cody's mustache"".

2.[US TITLE]ANTONIO CESARO VS R TRUTH-this was a good match but in my opinion it was too short. This felt like a match we could have got on Smackdown or something. Still it was a competitive match with back and forth action. Truth of course was the quicker of the two delivering his signature moves but Cesaro still comes out on top with a more grounded attack.

3.[I-C TITLE]KOFI KINGSTON VS WADE BARRETT-next up is the I-C title match and both guys deliver here. Once again it is a bit shorter than I thought it should have been but it was good. This was a great back and forth affair with Kofi hitting all the high spots and Wade using his power to his advantage. These two work really well together and gave us a great match with Kofi winning the title.

Right here we get CM Punk and Paul Heyman up in their box cutting a great promo on the New York crowd and Ryback.

4.[TLC MATCH]THE SHEILD VS TEAM HELL NO & RYBACK-talk about a war and you will be talking about this match. This was an extremely entertaining and dramatic match. This was the match I was most looking forward to and  I was right as this was an excellent match. I was surprised that this match was this soon into the event but still it was a great match. The Shield looked amazing in their first match sticking to the plan of many against one as they would isolate one opponent at a time. Ryback of course looked strong during his offensive moments as did Kane and Bryan was a ""pitbull"" as they called him. There were many high spots and crazy moments throughout the match. The double superplex off of the table, power bomb on the announcers table and Kane getting speared through the barricade and then getting buried never to be seen again. Of course Rollins took a huge fall that took him out of the match only for his teammates to get the win for the team moments later. I was happy that The Shield got the win here in what could easily be the best match f the night.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]EVE TORRES VS NAOMI-Naomi won the preshow Divas battle Royal to get the title shot here and like many other Divas matches it was short and nothing to special. Eve keeps the belt in a quick bonus match.

6.[WORLD TITLE CHAIR MATCH]BIG SHOW VS SHEAMUS-we get another good match up next which was the World title match in which chairs were legal. Sheamus looked good early on trying to take Show's legs out. Show would fight back and use his size advantage to overpower Sheamus at times. This was a high impact match that would see some good spots. I loved the KO shot Show landed and that huge chair was great. Show keeps the belt in another good match.

7. THE MIZ, ALBERTO DEL RIO, & BROOKLYN BRAWLER VS 3MB-this match happened as a bonus because of a 3MB guest appearance Miz TV segment earlier in the night. This was  a good little match that didn't take much time. It was cool to see the Brooklyn Brawler back in action although a little slower. The action was good and Brawler was able to get the win with a Boston Crab.

8.[MITB LADDER MATCH]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS JOHN CENA-Ziggler's Money in the Bank contract was on the line here against Cena. I remember wanting Ziggler to win so bad even though I like Cena. Anyway this was a really good match and actually one of the best of the night. Cena always seems do bring his ""A"" game when he is in there with someone like Ziggler. This was a very physical affair as this ladder match was basically a TLC match with all kinds of weapons being used. Ziggler of course was excellent as always but even Cena surprised everyone hitting things like a Frankensteiner. This back and forth contest was great but it was the ending that everyone will most likely remember. AJ comes out to stop Vickie from getting involved in the match only to turn on Cena as he is going up the ladder by pushing it over. This allows Ziggler to climb to the top and win. Great ending.

This was a fun event that had a few great matches in it and good ones throughout the rest. In all honesty this is one of my favorites of 2012. The Shield match is one of the most fun matches I have ever watched with everyone. Then of course the drama and ending of the main event was excellent. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone, also we get an interview with Dolph as a special feature. I still don't get why the pre show Divas battle Royal was not added as a special feature.",1374019200,3,5495,4.318137730358875

This WWE PPV had a Triple Main Event, each involving 3 different feuds ready for nothing less of a fight!:

1st: The Big Show (c) VS Sheamus in a Chairs Match for the World Heavyweight Championship.
- I didn't enjoy this match all that well because it was slow and boring.
- Not really worth watching (3/10).

2nd: Team Hell No and Ryback VS The Shield in a TLC Match; Match could only be decided pinfall or submission in the ring.
- Match is The Shield VS 3 men who they attacked. This was not a match, this was fight! Root for either, both sides should earn respect after this.
- Couldn't ask for a better not match, but fight (10/10)!

3rd: Dolph Ziggler VS John Cena in a Money in the Bank Ladder Match for a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship anywhere.
- A great back-and-forth match with great counters also and a somewhat ""shocking"" ending. This was one Dolph's best matches.
- Proves that Ziggler can match to the best, but still could have done something better to Vickie (9.5/10)!
