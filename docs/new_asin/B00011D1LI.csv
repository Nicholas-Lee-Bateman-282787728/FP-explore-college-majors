8005076,5,B00011D1LI,"Yes, it's utterly absurd, and arguably stupid, but this made me laugh out loud a number of times, smile a lot of others, and left my mouth hanging open with 'how did he do that'? camera moves, and 'did he just do that?!?' visual moments.

Berkley adds color to his extravaganza dance numbers wonderfully, and even the tiny plot is handled with more fun than most of his earlier films.

Carmen Miranda is terrific, as is Edward Horton, and the musical numbers are so over-the-top -- borderline obscene at times and flat out surreal at others -- that they're worth any moment of creaky dialogue. And for me, there were a lot fewer of those creaky moments than in Berkley's films from the 30s.

If you're lucky enough to be able to pay region B blu-rays, this is a definite step up from the US DVD.",1454544000,,795,4.431506849315069
8005077,5,B00011D1LI,"THE GANGS ALL HERE [1943] [Masters of Cinema] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] Hail! Hail! The Gangs All Here in Spectacular Technicolor!

The iconic director-choreographer Busby Berkeley's first full-length film in Technicolor of the classic 1940s psychedelia musical extravaganza and well established as being perhaps the most visually stunning spectacle of any Hollywood musical. But to focus on this risks overlooking its exuberant performances, gleeful humour, sensational music and glowing romance, amidst countless other pleasures.

A young soldier's fast-struck love affair with a New York City nightclub singer, despite his long-standing betrothal to a wealthy childhood friend, provides the catalyst for this dizzying parade of home-front melodrama, comic set-pieces and mind-boggling musical numbers, including The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat and The Polka-Dot Polka.

Featuring some of the most popular musical stars of its day, including Alice Faye, the incomparable Carmen Miranda, and the legendary Benny Goodman, along with brilliantly funny supporting turns from Edward Everett Horton, Eugene Pallette, and Charlotte Greenwood. The Gang's All Here is an outlandishly surprising classic from one of the Hollywood dream factory's most influential innovators. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present a world premiere of a stunning new restoration on Blu-ray.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The great choreographer Busby Berkeley [1895-1976] learned his craft as a US army officer orchestrating parades during the First World War and became famous in the 1930s regimenting chorus girls in black-and-white art deco musicals at Warner Brothers. The Gangs All Here was his first picture in colour, made on loan from conservative M-G-M to 20th Century Fox, which specialised in conventional, brightly lit Technicolor musicals, usually starring Alice Faye and Don Ameche. His wildest, most delirious picture, and it is of quoted on a regular basis and totally justified when it was said, Those who consider Busby Berkeley a master consider this his masterpiece, especially in the 1940s.

Hollywoods response to World War II was a strange mixture of escapism and gritty heroism. The year Busby Berkeleys The Gangs All Here was released also saw such fare as the gripping Edge of Darkness about a Swedish village that overthrows Nazi occupying forces and Action in the North Atlantic which brought the dreaded Nazi U-Boats and the War of the Atlantic right into American cinemas. Way over on the other end of the spectrum is Busby Berkeleys film. A seemingly disconnected story filled with dazzling musical productions, surreal, often phallic symbolism, romance, and beautiful dancing showgirls by the dozens.

At the heart of The Gangs All Here remains a story of a soldier, Andrew Mason [James Ellison], who, ahead of his deployment to the South Pacific to fight the Japanese, falls for the beautiful blonde, but very hard to get, showgirl Eadie Allen [Alice Faye], even though he is already engaged to his childhood sweetheart Vivian Potter [Sheila  Ryan]. His return to the States and a U.S. Bond drive put on by his parents and their friends and neighbours, the parents of his betrothed, lead to an awkward situation when both Edie and Vivian are gathered for a big charity performance. While the situation does allow for what is probably the realest moment in the film when Edie Allen, finally made aware of Andrew Masons two-timing, lets him know that his status as a war hero does not give him free rein to treat all the women left back at home like rubbish, for the most part The Gangs All Here is light-hearted, comical, and completely unaware of the real problems in the world at the time. Made in the midst of the big band Jazz explosion and the countrys newfound discovery of the South American and Latin sounds, the film also features music and appearances from Benny Goodman and his Orchestra and the wonderfully energetic Carmen Miranda, who, despite her marketing as a Latin spice, was in fact Portuguese.

With the return of Andrew Mason [James Ellison] to the United States and a U.S. Bond drive put on by Andrew Mason Sr. [Eugene Pallette], Mr. Peyton Potter [Edward Everett Horton] and Mrs. Peyton Potter [Charlotte Greenwood], plus their friends and neighbours, and the parents of his betrothed leads to an awkward situation when both Edie Allen and Vivian Potter are gathered for a big charity performance. While the situation does allow for what is probably the realistic moment in the film when Eadie Allen is finally made aware of Andrew Masons two-timing, lets him know that his status as a war hero does not give him free rein to treat all the women left back at home like rubbish, When Andrew Mason and the real Sgt. Pat Casey [Dave Willock] arrive at the club, however, Eadie Allen learns the truth. Andrew Mason proclaims that he wants to marry her and not Vivian Potter, but Eadie Allen insists on breaking off their relationship, as she believes that Vivian Potter really cares for Andrew Mason. During the show, however, Vivian Potter tells  Eadie Allen that she is going off to Broadway to perform as Tony De Marco's permanent partner, and reveals that she and Andrew Mason were never truly in love. As the show comes to a close, Eadie Allen and Andrew Mason reconcile their differences, and everyone joins in the final song. For the most part The Gangs All Here is light-hearted, comical, and completely unaware of the real problems in the world at the time.

Made in the midst of the big band Jazz explosion and the countrys newfound discovery of the South American and Latin sounds, the film also features music and appearances from Benny Goodman and his Orchestra and the wonderfully energetic Carmen Miranda, who, despite her marketing as a Latin spice, was in fact Portuguese.

Musical highlights include Carmen Miranda performing an insinuating, witty version of ""You Discover You're in New York"" that lampoons fads, fashions, and wartime shortages of the time. The film is also memorable for Miranda's ""The Lady in the Tutti Frutti Hat"", which because of its sexual innuendo, with dozens of scantily clad women handling very large bananas, prevented the film from being shown in Miranda's native Portugal in its initial release.[3][4] Even in the US the censors dictated that the chorus girls must hold the bananas at the waist and not at the hip. Alice Faye sings ""A Journey to a Star,"" ""No Love, No Nothin',"" and the surreal finale ""The Polka-Dot Polka.""

It is the visual aesthetic of Busby Berkeleys choreography that is the real draw in the film, however. His signature style of an almost monolith of dancing showgirls, wide angle overhead panning shots and a kaleidoscope of visual effects that include at one point the very obviously phallic use of giant bananas are both dazzling to watch, but also, at times, unsettling. The film ends with wonderful panoply of disembodied heads of the main characters against a background of swirling colours. It leaves one both mesmerised and also wondering what, if anything, the film might have really been all about.

The entire feeling of The Gangs All Here, in fact, is one of not just comedic excess and camp, but one of desperately trying to avoid the darker side of reality. It ticks all the boxes of the styles that were currently in vogue in Hollywood at the time in the 1940s, but it does it in its own peculiar way, one that exists in its own universe.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This Technicolor spectacular from 20th Century Fox comes to Blu-ray in a beautiful stunning 1080p encoded image.

Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There is only one standard audio track on this Blu-ray release 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio. For the record, Eureka Entertainment Ltd has provided optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. Generally speaking, depth and clarity remain pleasing throughout the entire film. There is a bit of room for minor improvements in the high-frequencies, but the music performances and the dialogue sound very good. Balance is good and there are no sudden spikes or drops in dynamic activity. Lastly, there are no pops, cracks, audio dropouts, or distortions to report in this review.

New and exclusive full-length Audio Commentary with critics Glenn Kenny and Farran Smith Nehme and Film Historian Ed Hulse: With this fascinating audio commentary, film critics Glenn Kenny and Farran Smith Nehme and film historian Ed Hulse discuss Busby Berkeley's directing style, 20th Century Fox's handling of The Gang's All Here, the socio-political climate in America at the time when the film was shot and specifically the effects the war had on the manner in which the narrative was structured, especially with the romantic and patriotic overtones, the film's surrealistic qualities, the music numbers, etc. Glenn Kenny and Ed Hulse share stories from their own personal interactions with Alice Faye on the repertory circuit, and all three are quick to call out particular sequences to which they are especially attached. Its a great balance of personal appreciation and scholarly analysis, allowing for the slight differences of opinion each person brings while allowing that diversity to prop up the film even more. Their discussion of Alice Faye in particular, was so informative and fascinating. We also here some other very interesting information, especially where they explain, among other things, how the films Latin flavour was due to the governments Good Neighbour policy, as European markets closed down, the US sought to reinforce its ties with South America, and how the film became a favourite of the New York gay scene when it was revived in the 1970s. We also learn that Busby Berkeley allegedly almost clonked Carmen Miranda on the head by accident during the opening scene with one of his beloved crane shots. The audio commentary was recorded exclusively for The Masters of Cinema Series in New York in February 2014.

Special Feature Documentary: Busby Berkeley: A Journey with a Star [2006] [1080p] [1.37:1 / 1.77:1] [19:29] This short retrospective piece includes interviews duel conversations with USC film professor Rick Jewell and President of the Institute of the American Musical Miles Krueger. Both gentlemen have clearly steeped themselves in classic Hollywood history and are devout fans of Busby Berkeley in general. A lot of neat things are touched on here from Busby Berkeley's place in a studio system that could be both supportive and extremely restrictive to a creative mind such as his well as lots of things that he did as signatures that were part of this film as well as his others and is a very lively and passionate discussion of the brilliant Busby Berkeley.

Deleted Scene [1943] [1.37:1] [480i] [5:08] Here we have only one deleted scene from the film and it is quite amusing, especially near the end.

Theatrical Trailer [1943] [1.37:1] [480i] [2:10] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for The Gang's All Here.

BONUS: A stunning characteristically stellar 56 Page Booklet featuring essays on the film by critics David Cairns and Karina Longworth, alongside a plethora of very rare archival imagery from the production of The Gangs All Here and we are also given the evidence of why Busby Berkeley was so brilliant at his craft and that he never stopped trying to push the boundaries of aesthetic possibilities in the cinema genre as far as Busby Berkeley could go, even if it meant going well beyond the limits of good taste.

Finally, Busby Berkeley's The Gang's All Here is a totally phenomenal production that has to be seen on Blu-ray to be fully appreciated. Shot in beautiful Technicolor, it truly looks and feels like a giant surrealistic dream in which anything is possible. Eureka Entertainment's technical presentation of The Gang's All Here is fantastic. Catch the dazzling excess, the surreal imagery, and the catchy musical escapades including Girl in the Tutti-Frutti Hat and The Polka-Dot Polka in this colourful wartime musical, The Gangs All Here, a classic bit of Hollywood escapism from the golden age. Its another fantastic package from Masters of Cinema, more than I ever could have dreamed this wonderful film would receive. Classic Hollywood musicals are usually held tightly by their respective studios, prohibiting access from distributors more inclined to offer scholarly appreciations, so this is an especially welcome development. I hope it is the first of many more, but even if not, it is extraordinarily valuable all its own. Highly Recommended!

8005080,2,B00011D1LI,"Frankie Darro's tough-kid adventures were a mainstay for low-budget Monogram Pictures in the late '30s and early '40s, and when two of Monogram's other series faltered, the studio lumped them into the indestructible Darro series. Thus Marcia Mae Jones and Jackie Moran (of Monogram's teen romances) and Keye Luke (late of ""Mr. Wong"") joined pop-eyed Mantan Moreland as Darro's co-stars, prompting the title ""The Gang's All Here.""

The title suggests a genial comedy, but the new co-stars are dropped uneasily into a crime-melodrama plot:  villainous truckers running a rival trucking company off the roads and out of business. Frankie and Mantan sign on as new drivers, and are targeted for death. Not as slow as some of the Monogram mellers, but a notch or two below Darro's best; the Darro gang would find more rewarding work in the musical-comedy format.

The source appears to be a carefully edited composite of two vintage prints, resulting in a fully complete and well preserved film. But the picture quality is troubling; the image looks jerky in a few scenes, like a movie taken with a digital camera, as though the action is being ""stretched."" This is either Monogram tricking up the speed of the ""truck"" exteriors, or an inferior digital transfer (the Alpha Video series is generally excellent).

It's nice to see Darro and Moreland in action, but B-movie fans might try Alpha's DVD of ""Up in the Air"" instead, in which the stars work with more assurance.",1101945600,14,1465,4.96734693877551
