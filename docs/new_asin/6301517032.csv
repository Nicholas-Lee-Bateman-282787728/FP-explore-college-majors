7813306,4,6301517032,"Heavy Nova was the 1988 album release by Grammy Winner Robert Palmer, one of his best selling albums world wide and million plus seller and Top 20 Chart Hit in the US. ""Super Nova"" essentially is the music videos for the songs that comprised the album.

Not exactly an inside look at the making of the record (Palmer's first after leaving Island Records) although there are some tidbits of trivia and information related to some of the songs and their videos courtesy of Palmer, who acts as defacto host, mostly in the form of an interview segment but also popping up occassionally to introduce and give limited background on some of the videos.  The videos more than the album are are the star here.

That said, Palmer was well known for his dislike in making music videos, depsite their immense popularity via MTV at the time. You're not getting visually arresting and out of the box creative music videos here, many are performance oriented clips. ""Tell Me Im Not Dreaming"" is filmed in a night club with Palmer & Band on stage (including back up singer BJ Nelson, who duets on the song), ""She Makes My Day"" (a huge hit for Palmer in the UK) and his cover version of ""It Could Happen To You"" are black white clips with Palmer in the studio, while ""Early In The Morning"" (a Top 20 hit on the US Charts for Palmer) mixes clips of Palmer and his band in rehearsal and in concert, both filmed during the Heavy Nova Tour's stop in Miami. Of course the mega hit ""Simply Irresistible"" is included, major US hit single and popular MTV Video.  For good measure, there are three songs included from an actual live concert (Wembley Stadium, London) including ""Some Like It Hot"" (a US Top 10 hit for Palmer in 1985 during his run with The Power Station) and a soulful rendition of Otis Redding's ""Dreams To Remember"", which would land on Palmer's next album two years later.

Some of the videos are rare and hard to find, and any live concert footage of Palmer and his band outside of promotional appearances on TV is also very rare, so 80s music fans and especially fans of Robert Palmer would enjoy this collection. It is largely based around just 1988's Heavy Nova album however so you won't find any other Palmer hits outside this album included. A worthy buy you will enjoy if already a fan.",1402012800,2,2287,4.54126213592233
7813307,3,6301517032,"1989's Super Nova video release from EMI Records is an hour long collection of muisc videos for the songs featured on Robert Palmer's 1988 Heavy Nova album (hence the video title).  The album itself was a major sales success in both the US and UK for Palmer, propelled by the very popular video and single ""Simply Irresistible"" in the US and the smash hit ballad ""She Makes My Day"" in the UK.  Videos for both songs are inluded here, along with videos for virtually every other song on the Heavy Nova album.  There is also live concert footage from Palmer's massive 1988-89 world tour (taken from a stadium performance in Birmingham England).  Palmer himself acts as host, introducing the videos and giving history on their filming or on the songs themselves.  Palmer, usually more enigmatic than charismatic, does a nice job of hosting what is essentially an hour long special on his Heavy Nova album.  The videos themselves are entertaining but nothing unusual in terms of visuals or production quality.  ""Early In The Morning"" was widely played on MTV in 1988-89 as it was a US hit single for Palmer.  If you are looking for rare music videos not often shown on TV this collection is a good choice, but limited as it focusses only on the Heavy Nova album tracklist, essentially representing just one year of the singer's long career.  If you are a fan of Palmer's work you'll likely enjoy this collection very much, as will most 80's rock fans.  ""Simply Irresistible"" was one of the most requested and played clips on MTV that year, a trademark video in Palmer's career.",1083542400,3,1573,4.728937728937729
