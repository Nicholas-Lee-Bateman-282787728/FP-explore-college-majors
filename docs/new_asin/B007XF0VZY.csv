Pop it in the DVD player, though, and you can tell it's not: the first three songs look like they're from the _Monster_ tour, but not all from the same show (based on the band members' wardrobes). Okay, so it's a compilation of tour footage, right? No! The next thing is the *video* for ""Imitation of Life"". Not even a performance, but the video you would have seen on VH1! Then back to performance footage! I'm so confused! ... And then more music videos! And back and forth, back and forth. (I think this DVD is having split-personality issues.) So it's some performance footage from 1995-ish, then videos from the late '90s and early 2000s. I'm just not sure what the makers (and of course, this doesn't look like it's an official R.E.M./Warner Bros. release) of this DVD were trying to accomplish, other than ""We've got the rights to some R.E.M. material, let's make some money off of it.""

I wouldn't spend your money on this unless you're a HARDCORE R.E.M. ""I must have ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!"" collector. I mean, I'm a hardcore completist, and even *I* wish I hadn't purchased this. If you get any of their performance DVDs (_Tourfilm_, _Perfect Square_, etc.) and/or video compilations, you'll be fine. But it is fun to see them in all of their rockin'-out glory again :)",1401062400,6,1401,4.626506024096385
