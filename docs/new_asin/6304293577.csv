7868950,4,6304293577,Very well done for 1960. The movie Midway even used footage from this film fifteen years later. Would recomend.,1431388800,,111,4.894736842105263

7868953,4,6304293577,"As promised in the title Suei Mastubayashi's ""I bombed Pearl  Harbor"" tells a story of a Japanese torpedo-bomber navigator (played  by Yosuke Natsuki) from the carrier ""Hiryu,"" beginning with the  attack on Peal Harbor and ending with well-reconstructed sequences of the  battle of Midway. The Japanese star Toshiro Mifune (""Hell in the  Pacific"") plays a secondary role of admiral Yamaguchi, commander of  the ship. For the war buffs, the film contains decent sequences of naval  aerial combat, reconstructed with some degree of detail and accuracy (the  most prominent mistake in this respect is the showing of American naval  torpedo bombers as two-engine craft). Otherwise, the story is totally  conventional and includes all the clich&eacute;s of a war film (a story of the  navigator's love interest at home, etc). It reminds me the most of an  almost contemporary German 1957 film ""Der Stern von Afrika"" (The  Star of Africa).  However, the value of viewing ""I bombed Pearl  Harbor"" goes well beyond its aesthetic or ""thrill"" merit. It  is a probably a typical example of the Japanese big-budget war film  production, which started as soon as the stringent U.S. occupation-era  restrictions placed on the content of Japanese films were removed. The film  is aimed at Japanese audiences and gives an almost totally  ""patriotic"" and pro-military treatment of the war. The film's  director, Shuei Matsubayashi was an Imperial Navy's veteran, known for his  ""loyalty"" and ""wartime patriotism."" It is because of  his ""patriotism"" (I am quoting from his short biography provided  by the Internet Movie Database) that the Toho motion picture company  entrusted Mastubayashi with directing big-budget war epics, which include  1957 ""Sumbarine I-57 will not surrender"" (the title is  self-explanatory) and 1981 ""The Grand Fleet"" (a story of the  sinking of the battleship ""Yamato"").  The Japanese public  obviously must have enjoyed the unapologetic story of Imperial Navy's  triumphs and reverses. Significantly, in 1960 Japan was in a state of  virtual civil war between the Socialist and pacifist left and the more or  less authoritarian right, which wanted to partially re-militarize the  country and push into a closer Cold War alliance with the United States.  The Japanese anti-war cinema, represented by Masaki Kobayashi's trilogy  ""The Human Condition,"" was obviously more pro-left. The films  like ""I bombed Pearl Harbor"" which portrayed a ""noble""  Japanese fight against the Americans, paradoxically, worked to the right's  advantage by emphasizing the glory and thrill of war, patriotism, duty,  hierarchy, loyalty and other ""traditional"" Japanese values for  which the right stood. In this respect the German ""Der Stern von  Afrika"" which portrays a totally ""sanitized"" version of war  for the benefit of the German public (from the movie one cannot even tell  who started the war, etc.) must have performed a similar function for the  re-militarization of Germany (even though the film is more anti-war than  ""I bombed Pearl Harbor""). Politically, the Japanese right won the  struggle across the board. On balance, I think that the movie is worth  seeing as both a portrayal of war and a document of Japanese public memory  of the war in the early 1960s.",961372800,,3266,5.297455968688846
