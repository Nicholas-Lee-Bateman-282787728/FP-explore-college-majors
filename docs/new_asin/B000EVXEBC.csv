8114844,5,B000EVXEBC,"I have rented this dvd three times from the library.  Now I'm going to buy it.  It is fantastic instruction for someone who has mastered handling the needles and getting the basics of casting on, knitting and purling.  There are classes offered in my locality, but the difficulty attending them makes this dvd perfect for me.  I can watch it carefully, as she gives clear instructions on each step.  I can back it up and watch a segment over that I didn't quite understand.  She describes yarns, needle sizes, casting on, decreases, gage and much more.  For what you would pay for a lesson you can have a permanent copy of instructions, in case you need a refresher, for the low price of around $24.00.  My granddaughter is learning to knit from this dvd also.  Although, she was interested before I am happy the dvd has increased her interest many times over and she is willing to try some of the stitches it introduces.  Each of the five hats incorporates new stitches to learn.  Each hat is extremely easy, practical and attractive and she teaches in very clear and easy to understand terms.  She is a little silly, but not overly so that is distracts the viewer.",1263772800,4,1166,4.579710144927536
