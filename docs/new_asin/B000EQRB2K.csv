8113460,5,B000EQRB2K,"It's #6 vs. #5. It's the Big Eight vs. the Big Ten. It's the first and, as it turned out, only meeting between Coach Osborne's Nebraska Cornhuskers and Coach Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines. A fun and interesting note about this game is the starting quarterback for Michigan, Jim Harbaugh, now runs the show for the Wolverines.
Except for halftime, this is the complete NBC telecast of the 1986 FIESTA BOWL presented commercial free. Even included is a nice little intro by Bob Costas promoting the network's bowl game triple header for the day. However, the most important message to convey here is the beautiful picture quality. It's close to perfection. You'll be hard pressed to believe you are watching a telecast from January 1, 1986. At two points(late in the second quarter and midway of the fourth quarter), the picture becomes very ""pixilated"" for a play but clears right up.
Good, entertaining game. Excellent quality. Buy this dvd!",1486944000,,946,5.031847133757962
