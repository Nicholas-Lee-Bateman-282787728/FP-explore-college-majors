2270041,5,B000980GWU,"I fell upon this movie surfing amazon and bought it because of Gale Howard, and was surprised how deeply it affected me. The acting was amazing! The small cast drew me in to the dysfunction and has been on my mind for several days. ART pure and simple.",1171756800,,252,4.270833333333333
2270042,4,B000980GWU,"I purchased this item mainly because Gale Harold was involved in it. What can I say? Gale Harold is sexy in anything. He does an amazing job in this film, playing Kyle, the youngest of four brothers. He is slightly insane.

Overall plot of the movie was decent though nothing to write home about. Jack and Ray (two of the brothers) were only home to find their fathers insurance money. Sebastian (obviously the only other brother left) was trying to put an end to their mothers' suffering. Kyle was the brother caught between the two groups, just wanting his mother to get better and to help himself get better.

Personally, I felt as if the moive were building up to something...and then just dropped off a cliff somewhere. It was like...where did the movie's end go?

Other than the rather crappy ending, its a good moive. Definately worth it if you're just trying to see more Gale Harold. :D",1158796800,4,894,4.610062893081761
8058217,5,B000980GWU,Just what I expected.  Like the actor & couldn't find it anywhere on TV.  Delivery was earlier than expected.  Would definitely use this vendor again.,1504915200,,150,4.92
8058218,4,B000980GWU,I purchased the movie because Gale Harold was in it. He was able to make me forget that he was Brian Kinney from Queer as Folk. Check out his 14 minute monologue in the special features. Very dark intense movie.,1461974400,,211,4.3
8058219,2,B000980GWU,"Like others, I bought it because Gale Harold was in it and the subject matter seemed interesting. I could not stay engaged, oh my goodness. The movie left me feeling detached and wondering when the apex would occur. I didn't buy the fact that they were all brothers, and for most of the film, I was wondering who was related to who and who were friends. It was apparent who the females were. Also, was I hearing a slightly Scottish/Irish accent from Sebastian, but not from the other ""brothers?"". What that just me? I just think there was so much missed with the way it was shot, the actors that were picked for the film, sequences I felt should have been included to help tell the story, the lackluster music... wow... there was just almost nothing there to move me, except toward the PS4 controller to stop the madness. Even though I could tell what everyone's motives were, it never really lead to any sort of gripping, or at the least bit, exciting conclusion. There were also a lot of long and boring parts.

I enjoyed the ""Queer as Folk"" Easter egg and seeing Gale do his best with the garbage he was given. It is not the worst film I have ever seen, but I will never watch it again. I am going to be selling it for $5 during my summer garage sale. Thanks!",1459728000,,1262,4.3474576271186445
8058220,5,B000980GWU,Great movie! Gale Harold is amazing.,1442793600,,36,5.166666666666667
8058221,5,B000980GWU,"I adore Gale Harold! He was excellent as the youngest of four troubled brothers in this sad tale told in flashbacks. Won't give anything away.
There is one scene which was done in one continuous 14 min. take!
A good movie and Gale just makes it better!",1425600000,,252,4.382978723404255
8058222,5,B000980GWU,I thought this movie was fantastic. Gale Harold is spectacular. He is so good at playing crazy. The rest of the brothers are awesome as well.,1411948800,,141,4.461538461538462
8058223,5,B000980GWU,"This is a great story about great characters. And Gale Harold carries an incredible monologue. Everyone is wonderful in this movie, but Gale Harold makes it!",1402099200,2,157,5.076923076923077
8058224,5,B000980GWU,"Not really a fan of movies with violence, but as part of the back story I felt okay with it. Interesting characters. Good story. Great role for Gale Harold.",1353715200,,156,4.413793103448276
8058225,4,B000980GWU,"Another movie I bought because of Gale Harold being in it.  Loved it.  Was such a sad situation for the family to be in and interested in how it affected their lives well into adulthood.  Seems they never could let go of how their mother died. If you not sure about purchasing look at You Tube many clips from movie but one is of a monologue from Gale, lasted 14 minutes or so, it will give you some idea of the intensity of the movie.  I would recommend you purchase it if you can deal with scenario of helping mother die.",1346803200,,523,4.148514851485149
8058226,4,B000980GWU,"this movie invite to trip into a single crazy night. gale and blake's scaring by yours performances. seems like a play, but face to face in a movie's frame.",1280620800,,156,4.413793103448276
