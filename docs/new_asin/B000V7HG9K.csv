2932797,2,B000V7HG9K,"I'm actually a fan of Andy Dick and his unpredictable, teetering on the edge on maniacal style of comedy so I actually was hoping that this dvd, his first time film theatrical effort would actually turn out to be decent.  Sadly that was not to be found with a mostly medicore and unfunny 84 minutes that felt stitched together at the last minute with a cheap (digital video) and unfinished visual style.  The flick does get 1 extra star for Jack Black's cameo.",1216512000,,460,4.530120481927711
2932798,1,B000V7HG9K,"Oh, Andy. I caught a little bit of this on Comedy Central and thought the whole thing must be hilaious, so i bought it. I have been a fan of Andy Dick ever since ""The Ben Stiller Show"" and I know not all of his stuff is gold, but even with all of the quirky cameos, nothing could save this mockumentary. I laughed twice. In 83 minutes.",1214179200,,335,4.014925373134329
2932799,1,B000V7HG9K,"This guy joins the list that includes such amazing talents as Carrot Top (Blueberry HEad), Tom Green etc in creating ""humour"" that is just idiotic and cheap. I cannot believe he is actually got a career he is awful. Talentless Hack. Someone needs to buy him a comedy manual or better yet remove his vocal chords so no one has to hear his awful awful awful ""jokes""",1207353600,,363,4.432835820895522
2932800,5,B000V7HG9K,"Andy Dick is amazingly creative in this ""auto-biography""??? poking fun at aspects of Hollywood and perhaps his own life in this mockumentary featuring cameos from Hollywoods finest actors and comedians.  He is self effacing to the point of re-enacting painful rehab memories.  This all star cast delivers the unexpeced around every corner.  I highly recommend this for any lover of Spinal Tap, or any Christopher Guest film.",1194307200,4,424,5.298507462686567
2932801,3,B000V7HG9K,"This whole movie was one big joke. It was hilarious. Especially the part where Anthony Rapp does the ""Another Great Day for Drugs"" scene. There were little references here and there that someone might not catch if they haven't seen other movies these actors have been in. You gotta love Jack Black and Anthony Rapp. It was awesome.",1189900800,4,331,4.724137931034483
2932802,4,B000V7HG9K,"I caught 'Danny Roane' one rainy morning on comedy central and was late to work because it was so funny.  When I logged on to Amazon to find this movie I was suprised to find a one star rating.  I had to chime in. This mockumentary in the style of Christopher Guest, has an amazing cast and Andy Dick makes a hilarious comment on hollywood, filmaking and himself.  I loved it and highly recommend this film for anyone who has a sense of humor.",1189900800,9,443,4.25
2932803,1,B000V7HG9K,"I had low expectations going into this, but Andy surpassed them. I watched this amazingly s***ty movie on Comedy Central (it went direct to cable for obvious reasons). This is one of the worst pieces of s*** I have ever seen. It's badly acted, directed, and filmed (it was shot on cheap looking DV). Dick got all his comic friends together and said ""I'm making a film"". Jack Black and Ben Stiller (among others) appear here, and they look tired, annoyed, and completely uninspired. There was a few scattered laughs, but this was due to the fact that the film ended up being like an Ed Wood film because it was truly awful. The film reminded me of a really bad ""art"" film from the 1960's where the filmmakers use a bunch of technical tricks to try and cover up the fact that they don't know what they're doing. The film is a true trainwreck. Andy Dick is the most overrated performer, and I've never understood why people think he's so funny. He's just a drug saddled celebrity, the male equivalent of Courtney Love.",1187395200,3,1015,4.521739130434782
2932804,5,B000V7HG9K,I love this movie.,1464652800,,18,3.75
2932805,5,B000V7HG9K,"I love you Andy Dick and I have missed you since your TV show on MTV.  This movie has all the crazy Dick antics you've come to love. A star studded cast such as Ben Stiller and Robin Williams works so well that you will be wishing for more Dick after watching this film.  I hope he continues his comedy stylings because I find Dick to be so refreshing with all this new-age politically correct comedy that puts not-offending people first.  Dick you always amaze me and I wish I could have more, honestly, the more Dick the better!",1464134400,,530,4.333333333333333

2932808,1,B000V7HG9K,Yawn!! And not at all funny.,1463356800,,28,3.8333333333333335
2932809,4,B000V7HG9K,"Andy Dick is funny as ever in Danny Roane: First Time Director. This movie isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of his, you will love this bittersweet tale of Danny Roane (Andy Dick), making his comeback in Hollywood, after being blackballed due to his alcohol fueled outbursts. To make his comeback, he decides to direct a film about the horrors of drugs and alcohol, which quickly spirals out of control. Tons of celebrity cameos are thrown throughout the movie. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and James van der Beek, along with many others. Some songs of Andy's are featured such as, ""Leonard's Ass is Bleeding,"" and ""Another Great Day For Drugs.""

For the price, if you are looking for a goofy comedy, with a bunch of guest stars, this is it. If you are a fan of Andy's this is a must own.",1435363200,,791,4.455172413793103
2932810,3,B000V7HG9K,"I can think of one thing that would've helped this movie get some traction: call it ANDY DICK: FIRST TIME DIRECTOR.  The line between reality and fantasy was already blurred enough.  The creation of ""Danny Roane"" was completely unnecessary.  This was Andy.  It would've given the film more credibility if he'd just said WHO AM I KIDDING--THIS IS ME.

The sitcom past.  The drugs and alcohol.  The alternating highs and lows on a daily basis.  This is actually Andy's life.  Why create a character when you are already a brand?

There are some really funny moments here and I liked most of the people in the rest of the cast.  I laughed out loud at Maura Tierney's scene (the dog had the funniest actions).

If you like Andy's humor, you'll probably like the movie.  If you like watching the train wreck downward spiral of Andy...well...I guess you'll enjoy that aspect of it.  And if you're involved in filmmaking from the most independent level, you will definitely appreciate a lot of scenes.

But it if it had just been a straight up ""documentary of Andy Dick making a film,"" it would've been the same film...but more effective, if that makes sense.",1419465600,,1152,4.69
2932811,5,B000V7HG9K,"I loved the Andy Dick show, but can't find it on DVD anywhere.  So I got this and can't believe that I hadn't seen it before.  If you are a fan, you will probably really love this.",1382572800,,180,3.8378378378378377
2932812,4,B000V7HG9K,"Andy Dick is out of his mind, but you can't beat this for stomach hurting laughs....you have to watch this 2 or 3 times to get all of the humour.",1284508800,,145,3.8666666666666667
2932813,3,B000V7HG9K,"Much better than I expected it would be.  If you buy it cheap, its worth the money.",1249862400,,83,3.8823529411764706
8217140,5,B000V7HG9K,This is basically a documentary.  Andy Dick shows the highs and lows of his life in a disturbingly hilarious way. I was really impressed. All in all a great movie.,1475280000,,163,4.433333333333334
