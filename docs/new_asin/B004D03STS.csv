8424618,5,B004D03STS,"The DVD holds two films.  One film, which starts off with the CIA logo flashing onto the screen, is the journey of a American news reporter through Communist China.  The Chinese, no doubt, showed him only the best parts of China and their Great Leap Forward but even that makes for a interesting 49 minute film.  It is refreshingly un-American in its point of view, seeming to state the facts, or at least the facts given to him by the Chinese authorities.  It shows a lot of energy on the part of the Chinese people but also shows some very big gaps in their level of scientific equipment and modern technology.  Well, modern for that time period.
The second film is a Chinese made one dealing with the explosion of the first atomic bombs by the Peoples' Republic of China.  It is VERY pro-Chinese, of course, but still the 34 minutes are worth watching and, funny enough, reminds me very much of some of the American ideas about the atomic bomb and the fall-out it produced.  It is dubbed, so don't worry about subtitles.
