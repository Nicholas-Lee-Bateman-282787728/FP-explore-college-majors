7846617,1,6303444431,"This is a low thrills thriller from writer/director Don Boyd, only distinguishable by the performances of Amy Irving as a rich bored alcoholic  bulemic kleptomaniac, Victor Garber in an all too rare acting role as Amy's  husband, and Patsy Kensit as a streetwoman whom Amy befriends. Casting Amy  and Victor as a married couple is an aural delight since both have  beautifully resonant voices. Call me perverse but seeing Amy dressed to the  nines, thoughts of the settlement from her marriage to Steven Spielberg  came to mind, though it seems Boyd glams her up so we can see her status  ravaged. It's also not fun when she masturbates with a stolen necklace, and  then runs it through her lips. You can tell when a writer/director opens  with a rape/murder that delicacy isn't going to be a strong element of his  auteur. Amy also has a bizarre scene where she drunkenly speaks from a  church pulpit, to the audience of her limo driver. I wondered where the  priests were!  Kensit's role is the lesser one, as the world-weary put-upon  waif, though she is direct and funny in her reactions to Irving. Boyd  doesn't seem to be worried when in the scene where Patsy teaches Amy how to  steal from a subway crowd, extras can clearly see what Amy is doing. I  guess it only proves how heartless New York is. He coats his film with  annoying country and western ballads, which tell us the meaning of what we  are seeing, as if we are so dim it needs explaination, and is fond of a  tilted camera, I guess to show how ""unbalanced"" Irving's  character and Kensit's underground underworlds are. And the smug ending,  accompanied by appropriate C&W song, is unforgiveable.",966124800,9,1665,4.688581314878893
