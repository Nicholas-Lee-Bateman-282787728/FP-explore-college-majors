2004990,4,B0001I55ZQ,"A lot of people are saying how much they don't like this season but ""hello!"" it's not over yet people! However, (...) the season will be coming to a close soon and I think it's safe to say that this is a pretty good season; it's very promising. I do agree with other critics that nothing can top Irina in the second season, but that's okay since I hear she might come back occasionally. I am enjoying the season villains for this year: the Covenant. I especially like Bomani. I also think the dynamic duo of Lauren and Mr. Sark is great. Sark is really getting his chance to shine in this season. Also, I've been reading spoilers and I can assure the critics who don't like this season so far that the best is yet to come. Anybody who's missing the family affair that was going on last season is going to love what's going to happen at the end of this month. Also, many people hate Lauren and I can understand it but I don't think they should. I admit, I hated Lauren when we all thought she was just the ""other woman"" but I actually like her as a villain. Plus, with episodes like: The Two, A Missing Link, After Six, Blowback, Facade, and the Frame, I can deduce that this is going to be a good season. I really can't see how they're going to top last season's cliffhanger though. Overall, I liked the second season a lot, but so far I think Alias is one of those shows that gets better as it progresses.",1081382400,2,1406,4.230483271375465
2004991,5,B0001I55ZQ,"""Alias"" is the best show on television.  Period.
From the beginning, the show has been nothing but purely original, captivating, exciting, entertaining, emotional, beautiful, gritty, and intelligent.  It looks like nothing else on TV, it sounds like nothing else on TV, and when you watch it, you have no choice but to become engrossed in the storyline and in the characters.
Seasons 1 and 2 were pretty straight forward until midway through season 2 when the SD-6 element was removed from the show.  Some fans and critics became skeptical that the show would simplify itself in order to grab more viewers.  But anyone who's watched the show since then knows that it is still the most complex and suprising show on the air (and really, we had to get rid of SD-6...How many more times could Syd be suspected of double-agentry without being found out?).
Season 3 has proved to be another test of the audience's devotion.  Many people have said that this current season (season 3) is subparr and that it just hasn't lived up to the previous two.  I disagree, and here's why:
--There is no other show that has changed its direction so quickly while still maintaining the heart of the show.  Each season has been astonishingly different from the last and each season the writing is consistently superb and the story lines remain fresh.
--""Alias"" is the art of storytelling.  If nothing else, the viewer feels he gets closer to the bigger picture of the ""Alias"" universe with each episode.  5 episodes until the end of season 3, we are still going back and filling in pieces from season 1.  It is a puzzle that is continuously being filled in and no other show has the same constantness.  Season 3 may be different from the first two, but in its own right it is still uniquely ""Alias"" and is every bit as addicting as the previous two years have been.
--The show never fails to shock and amaze. Just when you think you have one thing figured out, another secret will be revealed.  Makes for compelling storytelling and TV.
--THe acting is just superb.  If Jennifer Garner's Golden Globe and 2 Emmy nominations don't speak for themselves, then just watch the emotional scene at the end of ""The Two"" with her and Michael Vartan (Vaughn) in the hallway in which she expresses her hurt over his betrayal.  There is not an actor on the show who disappoints.
My only complaint is that Irina (Sydney's mother, played by Lena Olin) was absent this season.  She brought so much to the show last year, and while they've gotten along just fine without her, I miss her character and her interaction with Sydney and Jack.  But it appears as if it may be shaping up for her return, so let's cross our fingers.
All in all, I would say that I know the show won't always please everyone, but don't dismiss this season based on it's different direction.  It is still stellar, perfect television and will no doubt hook you in and have you craving for season 4 to start next fall.",1081382400,18,2954,4.617590822179732
2004992,5,B0001I55ZQ,"(...)P>The mystery regarding Sydney's 2 missing years was absolutely great - Julia Thorne, The Rambaldi Cube, Sydney going under the alias of Julia to try to find out what happened, and so many great missions and mysteries. Now there's the whole thing with The Covenant... and Sloane - who knows whether he's good or bad - that whole mystery is really interesting. And Lauren will be discovered - and Vaughn will turn the tables on her and start spying on her. Who knows what the CIA will do when they find out she's been deceiving them.
With 5 episodes left at this point, I can't wait to see what's gonna happen, and apparently, there's gonna be a new family member for Sydney in the last 3 episodes. Plus, Lena Olin might come back for an episode...(...)",1081123200,,757,4.573529411764706
2004993,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias is the best show on TV. It has everything you could ever want in a TV show. Jennifer Garner is terrific, along with Michael Vartan, Victor Garber, and Ron Rifkin. The cast is excellent, and the story is amazing! I really recommend this exciting, adrenaline-filled TV show to everyone! Every minute of it is awesome!",1081036800,,321,4.75
2004994,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Though not as strong as it's previous seasons, Alias still has the best action and plotlines on TV. The only thing most people have a problem with is the awful casting choice of Lauren (Melissa George). Jack and Sydney give their best perfformances yet, however. I would say that anyone who likes Alias would enjoy this; anyone who wishes to start watching should get season one first, then, if they like that, get season 2 and 3. Season 2 is the best.",1080777600,,452,4.524390243902439
2004995,5,B0001I55ZQ,"(...) Characters like Lauren and Robert Lindsay are not SUPPOSED to be likeable -- they are VILLAINS. And trying to say that Sydney is not someone you root for leaves me wondering -- why are you bothering to watch the show then? Rooting for Sydney is what it is all about. For those people saying she has no ""spine"" -- you try losing all memory of two years of your life and see how you react to it.
Season 3 has already had some incredible ""oh my god"" moments, and for that reason alone I will buy this -- one for me and one for my friend in Denmark who loves the show and can't see current episodes over there. This is definitely on my must have list.",1080604800,,653,4.109375
2004996,2,B0001I55ZQ,"What Happenned to Alias?  I didn't understand the reviewer that said this is the best season and it's packed with action?!
This season barely shows all of the cool action scenes we saw on the last 2 seasons, Sydney barely kicks ass! And don't let me get started on the plot , which is quite boring compared to the last 2 seasons, they seem to recycle materials , just with new characters and that's another downer , all the cool characters were gone- her best friend francy and even her evil clone, will and her mother. The love triangle of Sydney, Vaughn and Lauren is quite lame too, it seems like a bad soap opera, they just go on and on and all they give is a good yawn!
Sark is annoying too!
I'm just waiting for this season to end so I can see what happenned.",1080604800,6,765,4.204081632653061
2004997,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  I've been watching since the pilot got me completely hooked and have found that as the seasons progress the show only seems to get better.  The third season introduces new characters and new twists on the story, and places the completely likeable Sydney and Vaughn in a strange love triangle.  Not only must Sydney overcome her feelings towards Vaughn, but she must also figure out what has happened to two years of her life.  I wasn't wild about the plot twist when it was first introduced, but now that I've seen it progress I find it extremely exciting and heartwrenching!
As the season unfolds you learn what's been going on with the characters over Sydney's lost two years, but are left wondering about her until the middle.  New enemies are introduced and they make you want to rip them to shreads, leaving you yelling at the screen when they do something to hurt Syd, Jack or Vaughn.  And of course, new allies are also introduced, leaving you ready for a tissue at the end!
If anything, the third season has created more of a fan base.  Forums are packed with people raving about their love of Sydney and Vaughn, and of course, their hatred of Lauren!
Admittedly however, Alias seems to only be for intelligent viewers.  If you enjoy mind games, plot twists, and hidden innuendoes then this is obviously a must have.  If you don't like having to think about what's going on and prefer obvious plot changes and an easy going atmosphere within a show then perhaps you may want to skip on it!...",1080000000,2,1550,4.566787003610108

2005022,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Wow! Holly Hook has done it again with an action packed introduction to her new Deathwind series. The author managed to immediately grab my attention by diving straight into this novels drama filled plot. This is a fast paced book which doesnt slow down  not even on the very last page. Holly Hook has an amazing gift which allows her to keep the reader on the edge of their seat throughout. This book is full of action, suspense, betrayal and drama. The author has done a brilliant job of making this novels plot move seamlessly.

Allie is a normal teenage girl apart from her slight quirk. She loves tornadoes! During her holiday instead of spending her time at the beach with other girls her age, her uncle takes her tornado chasing. Although all seems well at the beginning of the chase Allies life is about to be turned upside down. After a tornado hits their truck Allie wakes up in a foreign barn with the sound of peoples voices surrounding her. Allie later awakens again only to find out she has become the very thing she has spent her whole life fascinated with. Throughout this novel Allie is faced with her uncles repeated betrayals, the reason she was turned and the discovery she is not alone in her new life. During this book there were small hints of a love triangle between Allie, Tommy her best friend and Dorian another out breaker who Allie appears to have a connection with. Although there seems to be a love triangle it is not evident as that is not what the book was about. This novel is purely about Allie herself and the new life she is forced into. The only criticism I have for this book is although there is mention of a connection being formed between Dorian and Allie very little is mentioned about it. I would have liked to have seen more reason behind it and a bigger reaction to it.

Allie was an easy character to like she had to deal with large changes in a short space of time and her uncles constant betrayals. Both Tommy and Dorian were great characters in my opinion, some parts of their personalities were quite similar. This meant if you liked one chances are you would like the other.

Overall this was a fast paced book which I enjoyed apart from one small thing. This was a fantastic start to a new series and if you likes Holly Hooks other books you will love this one as well. I would definitely recommend people try this books as soon as it is released.",1387152000,,2400,4.447727272727272

2005025,5,B0001I55ZQ,"This was a great series!  Ended way to quickly though.  We watch this still, to this day.  Highly recommend.  Highly recommend.  It was good enough what we would watch several episodes at a time!",1348790400,2,195,4.617647058823529
2005026,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Season 3 was a big reset in the show certainly and sadly for me not a particularly popular one among fans. The biggest reason for this disdain seems to be the road block in the Sydney/Vaughn relationship, I don't watch shows for character romance personally and had no problem with this whatsoever. The other is the removal of Will and Francie from the show and as a result the decrease in emphasis on Sydney's home and social life. I liked Will's on and off investigation storyline in season 1 and Francie's double trouble arc in the back half of season two and the show was different without them for sure. I still loved the increase in intensity this season brought though and that's why for me it's roughly equal with season 2, ahead of the also very popular season 1, as my favorite of the show. Season three of Alias wasn't meant to warm hearts or really even to get to know the characters better- which I understand some people will have issues with- it was meant to bring an aggressive, dark twist to the overall show almost every week and it almost always succeeded in doing that. This is the most mysterious season of the show for sure- I don't think the other four seasons combined keep the audience and/or and most of the characters in the dark as much as this middle season of the show- and I for one have always loved that approach.

I started watching Alias in the dark in the early morning hours via TNT reruns- there would be five or six episodes straight one, maybe two nights a week- and I think this season more than any other excels in that type of format. If you watch one or two episodes a day (or more) on DVD I think you'll probably like season three more than the original run audience as well. Maybe it wouldn't have played as well watching one episode a week with all the time to think about the characters, their lives, etc. built in. I was essentially holding my breath from one episode to the next in five or six hour bunches and didn't have time to focus on anything but the cliff hanger that just ended the previous episode. Regardless of how I watched it I was completely hooked by season three when I first watched it and I am still hooked.

I consider the episode ""Conscious,"" just before the halfway point of the season to be one of the two or three best of the series and to this day I still only watch it the same way in which I saw it for the first time- at night, in the dark, and in silence as I refuse to let anyone disturb me while this one is on the screen. It has to be one of my 15-20 favorites TV episodes of all time from any show. The episode ""Full Disclosure,"" just two episodes later is an instant classic as well that closes out the big story line of the first half of the season beautifully and then at the very end starts the big story of the rest of the season in absolutely stunning fashion. Season 3 is what I'd call a dedicated arc season whereas seasons one and two were more balanced between arcs and characters. For me the story emphasis was amazing because I thought the arcs were good enough to warrant the extra attention. Many people did miss the personal touches from the previous two years though and I do at least understand this criticism, I just don't really care about it that much when I'm as engrossed in the stories as I still am when watching season three.",1340236800,,3332,4.321086261980831

Season 2 got steadily worse - Sidney was becoming a weak, emotional wimp.
Her scenes with Vaughn were simpering, cheap romance-novel scenes.
Season2 predicted the rapid downhill slide of Alias.

Please, do NOT waste your time watching Season 3,4,5 - remember, time is something that, once lost, can never be regained - use it wisely.
I was fortunate to have stopped after Season 2 (I should have stopped earlier, but like many fans, I kept hoping it would improve)

2005048,3,B0001I55ZQ,"There seems to be nothing more terrifying to Sydney Bristow than waking up two years after she closed her eyes to find her world upside down: her squeeze married to another, a mysterious scar on her lower stomach, and two years of her life as material as a fairytale. As the season two closer, Bristow (played by Jennifer Garner) has woken up in a Hong Kong backdrop without any incilination of what has happened with her life.
The first episode holds the typical first episode feel: what has happened, and how can we fix it. Sydney finds herself strangely alone in a world she once found solace in. But as the script takes a turn for the worse, after a single day of going back to the CIA, she delivers a powerhouse monologue to her past love, Vaughn. I'm not sure if Michael Vartan is still the actor he once was in previous seasons, or maybe personal effects of his real-life relationship with Garner have surfaced onto the silver screen.
As the season progresses, and Syndey finds herself deeply entangled in the web of what has happened with her life, after waking up ""like it was just one night"", she finds herself fighting foes just as desperate as she to recover her memory, dealing with the day-to-day of working with Vaughn and his NSC wife, Lauren (well played by Melissa George), and finding how the terrorist organization of the season is getting so close to her life and her work.
Episodes that keep the ALIAS promise and remind one of the past two amazing seasons: Episodes 2-7, which draw their power from the state both Sydney and the viewer is in, mass confusion; Episode 9, a beautifully shot episode full of twists, turns, amazing sets and effects as Sydney goes throw an attempt to regain her memory by hypnosis; and Episode 22, the finale that holds more excitement than most, answering questions and asking new ones.
As ALIAS progresses, the seasons get less memorable with hard scripts and forced emotions, but this season  a lot of emotional sympathy",1217116800,,1975,4.675287356321839

2005064,3,B0001I55ZQ,"After the first season of Alias, I was hooked.  After the second season, I'd even call myself a fan.  As a guy, it doesn't get much better than a sexy female special agent rooting out sinister terrorist elements worldwide.  And Jennifer Garner really did something special by playing out multiple roles through the Sydney Bristow character, demonstrating a considerable range as an actress.  If that wasn't enough, there was the fact that Alias boasted what so many similar shows did not - an actual storyline, and one with some depth.

Unfortunately, it was somewhere in the midst of Season 3 that everything took a nosedive.  As if to keep the series running instead of bringing the plot to a satisfying conclusion, Season 3 saw the introduction of a completely unnecessary character in Lauren (nothing against Melissa George, however) - and a rehash of the same ""secret organization bent on world domination"" theme that was present in the first two seasons.

This season marks the tumultuous decline of the entire series, culminating, or rather flatlining, with the horrendous conclusion in Season 5.  If you love Alias, then watch this season, but understand that this is where things start to go horribly wrong.",1188691200,,1216,5.014925373134329

2005082,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Season 3 of Alias may go down as the most disliked of all seasons by fans of the show. Why? Because Sydney and Vaughn are not together this season. Let me say that if that is your only basis for judgement and you turned away from the show and didn't bother to give it a second chance, you missed a darn good season.

I thought breaking Syd and Vaughn apart was a great thing. Give this season credit, it tried something different. People complain that season 4 was too much like the first two, but yet when they get a different concept like this season they disapprove as well.

The first episode of season 3 entitled ""The Two"", may very well be in the top 3 Alias episodes of all time. Jennifer Garner gives her most fantastic perfomance of all in this one. Having said that, the first 4 eps of S3 are some of my faves of all time. Sydney's world is turned upside down and these episodes are breathtaking.

The season can be broken into two halves. The first half involves Sydney trying to recover her memory in which she's missing two years of her life. The second half involves the most hated character (I loved her, more on that later) in Alias history, Lauren Reed. Without giving too much away, she plays the biggest part in the last half of the season and Sydney is almost sidelined because of how big of a role Lauren plays. That's not a bad thing because the story is that good. Both halves are fantastic.

As I said, some of my favorite Alias episodes ever are in this season. However, it is not a perfect season. Unlike almost everyone else, my problem is not the Sydney/Vaughn relationship or lack there of, but a few other things. I never got used to Dixon being in charge. The whole time it just seemed like he was out of place. Second would be the absense of Sydney's Mom, Irina. She was the best part of season 2 and it's too bad she wasn't in this one, and the explanation why she wasn't there was so flawed. And my last complaint would be the awkward discovery of Sydney's half sister. It got to the point where I wished she wouldn't have so many family members thrown into her world of being a spy. Just seemed like they needed a new storyline so they threw her in there. Never got used to her.

So if you can go into this season with an open mind and know right from the start that thisseason is unlike the 2 before, you will love it. Two fantastic storylines blend together to create a wonderful season.",1167436800,2,2424,4.307017543859649

I think season 3 may very well be my favorite of all the seasons (and believe me I have watched them all!)  Although the love triangle between Syd/Vaughan/Lauren is an exercise in suspended reality (as all TV shows/movies are) it strikes a cord with anyone who has loved and lost or had their life shattered in some way. Here are some of my personal favorite season 3 moments: When Jack tells Vaughan that Syd will never be his mistress and Vaughan reacts in such a way that shows he would never make Syd stoop to such a thing. Julian Sark teamed up with Quentin Tarantino's character McKenas Cole was a stroke of genius and will stand as one of my favorite episodes ever!  The episode with Ricky Gervais of ""the Office"" as a vengeful bomb maker and Vaughan pretending to be Sark was a blast! Peggy Lipton of ""the Mod Squad"" as Lauren's evil Mom! When Vaughan finds the wig belonging to Lauren that seals the fact that Syd was right about her!  Every single season of Alias has significant highlights and many of them occur in season 3.

My opinion is that the erratic scheduling of the show made it less compelling to follow on TV. But on DVD back to back episodes show how the thrills kept going through the season.

2005085,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias had a heart-stopping season finale for Season 2.  I'd heard negative things about Season 3 (and I'm experiencing Alias for the first time on DVD, actually, I only saw glimpses of it on TV), but I was eager to jump in.  I wasn't disappointed--the formula was much the same as the others: Sydney's life is totally screwed, but she finds a way to cope with the changes by about the second or third episode.  Sure, there are characters missing, but I hardly think that makes the quality deteriorate--though I would admit that not seeing Sydney's mom definitely makes you wonder what's going on with her (and I thought Lena Olin was awesome in that role, so dangerous and so doggone seductive with just one look, so I'd be the first to say the show isn't the same without her, but it's still great without her).  (And what was up with the person analyzing the Ford F-150 scene??  That's a little TOO much thinking, it's a TV show, every show or movie has a hole somewhere if you look hard enough.  I mean, honestly, how many times would Sydney have been killed in the real world during the first two seasons?  Probably a lot.)  For me, it was just more of what I love: Alias!  Besides, as long as you have Sydney, Jack, Sloane every so often (who is a great villain without even really changing his expression much, because you really never know what he's really up to except that it's got to do with Rambaldi), Vaughn (another person whose expression hardly changes, but he's still very good at his role), and Sark, you can't go wrong.  I enjoyed this one because it had more of Sark, who I thought was pretty cool.  And I think adding Lauren to the mix was a good way to throw intrigue and very personal issues into it all.  There's nothing wrong with Season 3--I was addicted to it just as I was to Seasons 1 and 2.  And I've watched the first 2 episodes of Season 4, and that has been pretty good, too.  Just sit back and enjoy Alias without over-criticizing.  Either you'll love it or hate it anyway, no matter what I say...but I love it!

Every person has times in their lives when nothing seems to go right and everything is upside down.  Season 3 was a successful change.  Seasons 1 and 2 were great, but another season similar to the previous would have been repetitive.  Season 3 kept me in suspense:  What really happened to Sydney?  How will Sydney and Vaughn's relationship end?  What will happen to Lauren? I loved Season 3. I loved how Sydney and Vaughn still loved each other, but tried to stay apart. I have bought all of the seasons of Alias, and Season 3 is one of my favorites.  Buy Season 3--You will not be disappointed.",1156204800,6,729,4.589147286821706
2005087,4,B0001I55ZQ,"I did watch the first season of Alias and I do believe I even saw the second season, and I saw parts of the other seasons, but it had been quite awhile inbetween my viewing of seasons 1 & 2, so I can't give a review based on watching the first 2 seasons of the show.

Despite others saying that season 3 was clearly a disappointment, though it is said the acting was still top notch, I cannot say the same about the disappointment part.  I was on edge the entire time I watched this season.  I stayed up all night watching the entire 6 disks, and the only disappointment to me was the fact that I didn't have the next season to follow up on.

I remembered enough from the first two seasons to keep me up to date on what was happening via season 3.  I rate it four stars because I felt that it lacked a little in explanations, but other than that I was riveted, and ready to pop in the next disc.  I found that the plot for season 3 had nice twists and turns to keep my interest peaked for the most part.

But if you are a die hard Alias fan, you might find that season 3 isn't written as well as the first two seasons and some actors previously in the cast only make guest appearances, and short ones at that.  So, I can see how it might be a disappointment to Alias fans.  But, I bought season 3 at regular price and I wasn't disappointed.  So, maybe you won't be either.",1155859200,,1372,4.048148148148148

Each mystery packs a powerful punch; Where has Sydney been? Will she reunite with Vaughn? Who is Lauren working for? Why did Sydney kill Lazery? What's Sloane's secret...

The twists and turns are neverending. This season, despite what some say, is fantastic. Many questions are raised, but by the series' end... everything comes together.

This purchase is well worth it.",1154304000,2,568,5.086021505376344
2005099,4,B0001I55ZQ,"So all in all I didn't hate Season 3 the way I often see others ranting on about it. However I also believe that's because I didn't have to wait week to week for answers, I could and practically did watch each episode back to back. I finished the entire season in approximately 2 days. I rate this 4 stars, because despite not living up to season 2's cliffhanger hype it's STILL one of the best TV shows out there.

With a cliffhanger like the one in Season 2 you know there's big things about to go down, and the first half of season 3 didn't disappoint.

The petty drama between Lauren, Vaughn and Syd was to be expected considering the situation, but luckily it takes a back seat to watching Sydney obsessively track down her lost 2 years. It was a lot of fun to me and FAR outweighed the silly dramas. Syd blowing up the car in the second episode has got to be one of the best action shots ever. Julia Thorne is Syd's ultimate alias. Loved her! And the memory recovery attempt/dreams episode was one of the most highly creative editing jobs I've seen on TV.

A pet peeve I have with this season though was the absence of Will Tippin. (read: unimaginative writers wrote him off) Granted, I'm biased because he's been a favorite character of mine since day 1, but he always gave the show (and Sydney) a more grounded feel to me. A little bit of realness in Sydney's life considering all the high action drama. Supposedly the writers didn't think it was working having Will be part of the CIA, but frankly I couldn't get enough in season 2, he fit perfectly into their world! --- Besides, if I were to analyze Will as a character, I'd know there's no way on earth he would've just accepted Syd's death and marched right off to witness protection. Not after what happened to Danny and Francie. Those reporter/investigating instincts would've went into overdrive landing him right back in the middle of trouble alonside Jack. But that's just my personal idealization and I guess the writers had other things in mind.

This season was also missing one other key charismatic player, IRINA DEREVKO. A few chats with Daddy Bistow here an there doesn't fill the void of the wildly mysterious and conniving Irina. Sadly it's all because they couldn't negotiate a contract with the actress. Her absence is starkly evident and she is missed.

Anyway, it's a bit strange to think back on this 3rd season. Literally 1/2 way through it feels like a completely different show. In the second half of the season things get a little off course which is, I assume, why this season is so loathed among many of the fans. Watching post coital Sloane & Dr. Barnett or seeing Daddy Bristow swapping spit with Auntie Dereveko was never high on my Alias `wishlist of things to see', ever.

Besides the cast absences I believe they messed up in 2 key places in this season. First was revealing everything to Sydney about her missing 2 years in one episode 1/2 way through the season and the second was initially bringing Lauren in as a Vaugn's goody-two-shoes wife just for the soap opera drama effect. It was lame and cheesy. If they wanted to pursue the ""love triangle of doom"" route, one was already forming between Syd, Will and Vaughn in season 2, why change it?

In my opinion Lauren should've been seen as the `bad girl' all along. When I thought I could take no more of the soap opera ""love triangle of doom"" they switched things up and brought in Sark as evil-Lauren's ally. She and Sark sizzled up such a flat/stale storyline and I must admit I had WAY more fun watching Lauren and Sark take down the Covenant leaders and thwarting the CIA's plans than I did watching the angst between Syd and Vaughn *yawn*. But I guess on a show about the good guys trying to stop the bad guys it's not really ideal that the writers had managed to get me to cheer on the bad guys. It's a shame they couldn't have made it work by letting us root for both Syd/Vaughn and Sark/Lauren. (boo!)

Oh and I almost forgot, Sydney's sister... sadly there's no substance to her right now, and as you can tell, she's a fairly forgettable character. Maybe she'll be more interesting in season 4, but for now I coudn't care less about her. She truly does feel like yet another Rambaldi Artifact (read: plot device) and not an actual character.

The cliffhanger for season 3 also left much to be desired, but I don't think anything will ever top Season 2's cliffhanger so anything else would pale in comparison.",1152835200,,4466,4.517326732673268

2005101,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Somewhere along the way all of a sudden people started saying Season 3 of Alias is ""no good"". Somewhere along the way people actually believed it. And somewhere along the way someone has to come on here and tell you nothing could be farther from the truth. That is me. I'm only halfway through Season 3 but I simply can't sit around another minute and let someone pass up Season 3 based solely on misguided opinions.

Season 3 marks a huge change in the show because of circumstance. I suppose I can conceive people not liking the change of characters through a radical shift in circumstance (Syd's disappearance) however to write a review proclaiming this show has declined because of it is simply untrue. Just like LIFE, the show moved on and it only adds to the drama, not detracts from it. How a person can say Season 3 is nothing more than ""a love triangle with guns"" must have not paid attention to Season Two (the one they gloat over, which I also love). That was a love triangle of a different sort between Sydney, Irina, and Jack Bristow... with guns. Replace that with Sydney, Lauren, and Micheal Vaughn and you have a beast of another shade, nothing more. Maybe not as strong, but certainly no less compelling.

Add to that Syds memory loss/disappearance, Marshall's baby/gf, Dixons revenge, Sloanes ""apparent apathy"", Allisons return; shaken liberally, and you have a bonafied winner. Drink up!",1147392000,5,1406,4.758196721311475
2005102,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Shows at times tend to falter somewhere. The X-Files can be argued it lost steam around season 6 or 7, Law and Order was pretty much when they just rewrote same storylines with new people(how far back that would be? wow.) and Buffy had a pretty mediocre 6th season. A lot of people will say Alias' blemish was its 3rd season and yes it does have problems but then it was also quite entertaining and I even did another marathon and finished it in 2 days.

Season 2's finale had CIA agent Sydney Bristow waking up in Hong Kong having been missing for 2 years. Now everything's changed: her dad's in jail, her friend Dixon is Director of their group, op-tech geek Marshall is still with Carrie Bowman with a surprise on the way and 2 worse things: her archnemesis Arvin Sloane is now a supposedly reformed humanitarian and her love Vaughn is actually re-married. Mysteriously there's a new group called the Covenant which are the main focus of villainy for this year.

In season 2's episode Phase One, the CIA successfully dismantled and shut down all SD-6 cells and the Alliance members. Unlike the X-Files which didn't solve the Samantha Mulder mystery till season 7(very clumsily I might add), people were expecting a long drawn out fight but the series hit the refresh and got rid of SD-6 halfway. Season 3 does this with the 2 year missing but it also got slightly silly at times. The Rambaldi plot gets added on more and more to the point where it felt like there wasn't a foundation, just a ""yep, there's an added part to it we just found out"". How convenient.

Another sillyness came from other conveniences as well, namely the elusive Mr. Sark and others who always seems to avoid capture even with no possible escape plan and the reappearance of supposed-to-be dead enemies. If you're planning a drinking game for Alias, take a swig everytime somebody mentions ""Rambaldi"" or the ""Passenger"", I'll swear you'll hit the floor really quickly.  But such is the world of Alias and can't knock all that much.

Sure it's kind of a weak season but it's quite interesting too with plot twists, recurring and new characters and one nice addition right at the end of the season that gets more fleshed out in season 4 but still, you kinda know Alias is better than this.",1147305600,3,2265,4.610421836228288
2005103,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Let me say first off that I *really* love the Alias series. I love the multiple sides of each character, I love that the heroine is smart, skilled but also vulnerable. I think that season 2 was *fantastic* and incredibly well done. That all being said, I was a bit disappointed with Season 3. I think if I'd seen Season 3 first - without any background - that I would have been blown away with what it offered. However, Season 2 was so incredibly brilliant, so well crafted from start to finish, that Season 3 was just not up to that same standard. I'll try to give this review without giving away any of the key plot points in this season.

First off, some of the episdoes have HUGE plot holes that truly defy definition. Sydney, who is super-fast at running and super-accurate at shooting, suddenly loses these skills when it's convenient. Characters see-saw incredibly from feeling one way to feeling the exact opposite with very little reason. Some product placements in the show are completely blatant and obvious - but not only that, the placement is done in such a silly way that you get BAD impressions about those products.

However, the huge issue I have with this season is with the entire premise. Season 2 was brilliant. Sydney and Vaughn built up an incredible relationship, full of strength and meaning, and the big cliffhanger at the end of Season 2 was that she'd been ""lost"" for 2 years and presumed dead. Vaughn had remarried.

So we begin Season 3 with Sydney back - still loving him - and Vaughn having ""moved on"" but of course still in love with her. Good enough - this has been done on Star Trek and many other shows before. However, it was REALLY EVIL to have a good part of this season involve a married man - i.e. Vaughn - with a wife who married him in good faith, and Sydney being the ""other woman""!! What, were you supposed to root for Sydney to break up a married couple? Root for Vaughn to leave his wife, who he loved? The whole thing was completely nasty as far as I was concerned. Regardless of what might be revealed later in the season, the whole premise was just nasty. I took no pleasure at all in watching any of those episodes.

On top of this, both of Sydney's friends - Will and Francie - are out of the story. Both helped make Sydney a full, rounded, human character. Now all she had was her way-too-obsessed father and her cheating-in-his-heart married boyfriend. In the meantime, the main plot - Rambaldi - has been dismissed in a completely ridiculous way. Sloan says ""Oh it only gave me blank paper and ""peace"" when I assembled it, so I gave up on my 20 year quest."" As if! Plus he threw away the paper as being meaningless? And everyone accepted this? There was no longer any real immediacy or meaning to what the group was doing. Even as the season neared its ""climactic ending"", the things brought in seemed forced and artificial. The final season cliffhanger was completely silly. Again, compared to Season 2 which ended with an amazing twist that made you really think and wonder, Season 3 ended with a NON-revalation which made you wonder, ""What was THAT all about?""

I definitely watched season 3 and still consider Alias to be one of the best series out there. I am really sad, though, that they ""fell"" so much compared to Season 2. Obviously they had the skills from Season 2. They could have made the series just as incredible. Why did they go with less well written plots and with the inane product placements? Were they thinking they could coast now that people were so in love with Season 2? Surely we viewers deserved more than that, given how much we supported them!",1145664000,2,3628,4.5159817351598175

Jennifer Garner continues her great acting, carrying the show, but the plots have become increasingly laughable and dull.  The only other really compelling character, Will, has been written out.  The action sequences are well choreographed, but dull, since Sidney's missions all proceed in an identical fashion, except for her getup and the location.  If you must watch this, do so as a drinking game, taking a gulp whenever any character says ""Rambaldi"", and downing the drink for the full ""Milo Rambaldi""; Midori mellon liquor is recommended since it looks exactly like Rambaldi fluid.

2005106,3,B0001I55ZQ,"I have been hooked on Alias since the beginning, and will likely continue to watch it out of loyalty no matter what. Of course I used to say that about West Wing too.

Season three had many of the qualities I've always enjoyed in this show: strong acting from the whole cast most of the time, with character development for almost everyone; interesting plot lines (after a rocky start) and twists; good action scenes. The main reasons season three was somewhat disappointing to me are: 1) When a script calls for a main character to have amnesia, it's a thinly veiled statement that the writers are out of ideas and literally have to wipe the slate clean and start again. I expect better from such a creative team. They do seem to have regained some ground after dumping the amnesia plot on us, but was that really necessary? 2) The loss of characters like Francie and Will are not necessarily huge losses in and of themselves (though I happened to like them). What we really lost is the sense of Sydney as a whole person, not just a two-dimensional cartoon superhero. Any show that cannot envision and portray its characters as fully-realized human beings with all the attendant quirkiness takes the chance of losing the connection with the audience and becoming meaninglessly repetitive right before its cancellation. The same issue relates to Sydney as a grad student, as someone with some other goals or interests in life outside of SD6/CIA. 3) The blatant product placement was a significant problem. It took me right out of the moment and got me thinking, not about buying a truck I don't need, but about how uncomfortable Garner much have felt saying that (assuming she truly cares about the quality of the show, which I think she does). I accept that advertisers know we don't watch ads anymore, but I would appreciate a little subtler approach please.

One of the great joys of the first couple of seasons of Alias was the blend of ass-kicking (who doesn't love that?), intelligence (who speaks all of those languages?!), and nuance (Sydney and Vaughn's relationship, though inevitable, was approached very slowly - the build-up of attraction and then passion was much more enticing than if they had just gotten drunk and slept together in the second episode). A straight action plot would be instantly forgettable, while a show with only nuanced character drama doesn't have a chance at pleasing enough people with short attention spans. Fine. But I hope they don't spend too much time catering to advertisers and to their best guess at what will please most of the people most of the time.",1134345600,5,2600,4.801339285714286
2005107,5,B0001I55ZQ,"The second season of Alias ended with the show's best fight scene to date and one of television's most jaw dropping cliffhangers of all time.  Unfortunately, the shocking finale caused the writers to spend much of the next season cleaning up fallout from that surprise, and many of the loyal viewers didn't think it was on the same level with the first two seasons.  A lot of people didn't accept Melissa George as Michael Vaughn's new wife, didn't like the idea of Arvin Sloane being a benevelont and benign humanitarian and spent the entire season pining away for the return of Lena Olin as Sydney's mother.  While they were complaining they missed some compelling relationships, more shocking surprises and the addition of Sydney's sister and a second Direvko sybling.  The acting is as first class as the previous years, the dialogue is extremely sharp and the plot twists are still crisp enough to keep up the espionage show's vaunted reputation.  The Alias DVDs are never loaded with too many extras, but the animated episode [""Tribunal""] is exceptional.  If there is a true dissapointment to season 3, it is the confusing final scene that serves as the cliff hanger.  Compared to the fantastic climaxes to each of the other four seasons, this one is a vague snoozer that fails to raise any real excitement for the next episode.  None the less, this season is still not as bad as a lot of devoted viewers make it sound and is a must own if you're at all a fan of the show or Jennifer Garner.",1129680000,6,1497,4.665399239543726
2005128,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Well, now that everyone on the planet has pointed out Season 3's ""bad"" quirks, let's talk about some of things that make this season, not as HORRIBLE as everyone says. A devoted fan since day one, I promise you, I won't ramble on...

As tragic as it was for Sydney to be missing for two years, it brought about some very interesting and tense issues for her and Vaughn. That first episode...or was it the second, where she rightedly told him off for moving on and getting married - ""I would have waited"", she proclaims,  not only showcased Garner's great acting abilities but brought closure to the situation (as much as we could expect) for such a traumatic experience in that she not only found out she had been missing, but she again, lost the love of her life.  Another interesting pawn in the game was the level at which Laura's character brought tention to the whole story. She not only was the new wife reflecting jealousy from Sydney's point of view, but the bad guy as well. The psychological aspect and mind games that went on between the three characters was fantastic. Everyone hated her but she was so good at deceiving, you couldn't help but give her props. The whole ""we know but they don't"" tactic keeps things fresh.  For this I give Alias Season 3 Five stars. I don't think these seasons should be compared with the last, but looked at as a work by itself.",1127779200,10,1374,4.506024096385542
2005129,2,B0001I55ZQ,"This season could have been better. It was doomed from the start, courtesy of season 2 cliffhanger, because both Sydney's amnesia and disappearance had to be explained, and it was too much. However, some of the plot changes were really good - Vaughn's being married, Sloane's new ideology - but most of the story lines were just lame. It was so convenient that Lauren turned out to be bad because then, despite Vaughn's attraction to Sydney and their kiss, he could not come out as the bad guy. It would have been much more interesting if Lauren had not joined ""the dark side of the force"", because then Vaughn's character would have had to make a choice. And the introduction of the unknown sister is simply bad soap-opera TV. I did not buy it ! But I unfortunately bought the DVD, which is hardly saved by a couple of interesting extra features.
Excuse my French, but to me, this show seems to consider its audience as a bunch of ""dumb and dumbers"" craving for lame twists.",1125014400,5,975,4.545454545454546
2005130,4,B0001I55ZQ,"I have to admit to waiting a couple of months before finally picking up season 3, regardless of that incredible cliffhanger at the end of season 2.  The first eleven episodes deal with resolving Sydney's amnesia, coming to a close in the aptly titled episode 11, ""Full Disclosure.""  Those eleven episodes, for what it's worth, are all outstanding shows with very little predictability and stellar acting from everyone involved.  But then the show plummets into a state of limbo and encompasses an utter lack of direction.  By the time episode 14, ""Blowback,"" unfolds the show has hit rock bottom with the most boring ""Alias"" episode ever filmed.  However, just two episodes later, episode 16, ""Taken,"" challenges for the worst episode ever made, period.  The final scene of ""Taken"" is so horribly written as to be painful; what makes it more so is that I know somebody got paid to write that rubbish!  After that episode, however, the show had nowhere to go but up.  The Rambaldi storyline picks up the remains and slowly but surely renewed my interest in what the characters were doing and where they were headed.  It should be noted that during the first eleven episodes very little is even mentioned about Rambaldi and his devices and/or prophecies.  I found this an enjoyable vacation for the show to take while the characters were never more interesting or more attractive to the eye.  Sydney's mother is never seen, only relating online, in season 3, which is certainly a shame, but there are plenty of new and steadfast recurring characters to keep the show afloat and often very exciting.  The acting, except in the aforementioned dud episodes, is as good as ever, Jennifer Garner leading the way admirably with veteran actors pitching around the corners successfully time and again.  Ron Rifkin is especially memorable in many episodes.  If you just finished season 2 and are simply aching for more, but are simultaneously apprehensive due to the many average reviews present for season 3, don't wait.  I blazed through season 3 faster than either season 1 or season 2, the first eleven epsiodes in a matter of a few days, and I soonafter pre-ordered season 4 when I was finally finished.  The first half of season 3 is superb; the next few episodes are a travesty to behold for any ""Alias"" fan; but the final shows bring it all back together and have the story back on track for a promising season 4.

2005131,3,B0001I55ZQ,"I agree with the majority of Alias fans when I say that season 3 was by far the worst of seasons so far. Lauren tore Vaughn and Syd apart, Will and Francie were gone and took virtually all of the ""Syd at home"" bits with them, and the best part of the season 2 was gone. Lena Olin was perfect in the roll of Irina Derevko, and I wish contract reasons had not driven her away from the show. Isabella Rosallinni as Katya Derevko was a rather weak attempt to bring back some of the depth and mysteriousness Olin's Derevko brought to season's 2 and 4. Season 3 was not horrible though, with Sloane's new found role as a ""humanitarian,"" bringing some depth to the formerly pure evil character. The whole Covenant thing got a bit old after a while since in previous seasons there was never just one evil organization, but many. I have seen the last half of season four, so I will have to watch the first half eventually. But I am hoping season five's pregnancy storyline will bring back the ""Syd outside the CIA"" parts that made the show less sci-fi.

2005132,3,B0001I55ZQ,"This is my favorite TV show. I loved Seasons 1, 2, and 4, but this one was crazy. It started out good. Great acting, great story. It had me hooked. The show then took a Christmas Break like all shows. But when it started back up, it was horrible. There was no storey, chracter development got weak, and the script was just horrible. It got a little to unrealistic. Ask a friend about the final episode and thats all you'll need to know about this season for the fourth one.",1121385600,,473,4.266666666666667
2005133,5,B0001I55ZQ,"As the credits rolled on the season finale of ""Alias: Season Two"", I know I was shocked by the cliffhanger, and frustrated that I was now going to have to wait 3 months to find out what the heck happened to Sydney to cause her to wake up in Hong Kong and have 2 years of her life missing.

""Alias: Season Three"" as the previous seasons have done, picks up right where season two left off.  Sydney wakes up in Hong Kong, calls in to CIA and Agent Vaughn comes to meet her.  As Sydney tries to kiss and embrace the man she knows to be her boyfriend, she notices something is not quite right, Vaughn is wearing a wedding band.  As if that wasn't enough of a punch in the gut, here's the real kicker, Sydney's been missing and presumed dead for 2 years.  Now, Sydney must find out where she's been for 2 years, who is responsible for her current dilemma, and how can she cope with Vaughn being married for over a year, when the last thing she remembers is beating up a clone of her former roommate, Francie.  What a way to come back to work.

""Alias: Season Three"" really shook things up for the show, even more so than the previous season did when the CIA finally took down SD-6 and Sydney and Vaughn finally hooked up.  This season basically took what Sydney and the audience knew from the first 2 seasons of this incredible show and turned it upside down.  ""Alias: Season Three"" delivered some very unique twists as Sydney struggles to discover what to make of her life now that everything is different, and a new terrorist threat emerges called The Covenant, and this group is not led by Arvin Sloane.  If you loved the first 2 seasons of ""Alias"" and if you have any sense at all, then you did, then you will most definitely enjoy ""Alias: Season Three"".  Don't miss it.",1120608000,2,1769,4.33030303030303
2005134,2,B0001I55ZQ,"After being riveted to Alias through Season's 1 and 2 I was dissapointed to find Season 3 loaded with day-time Soap Opera drama and cliche suspense. About five episodes were good and that's being generous. The rest did nothing to develop plot or character.

By Soap Opera, I'm referring to the endless and uninteresting fueds between Sydney, Vaugh, and Lauren (as well as the infidelity overtones - the foundation of every Soap Opera). Please! We learn Lauren is a bad egg halfway through the season; clearly the producers realization that it was a near career fatality to bring her into the show in the first place. So just end it there, why drag her (and us) through to the end of the season, smearing Vaugh and Sydney's discernment both professionally and personally along the way.

As if this isn't enough, we are also subjected to the worst cliche suspense since the Scream series. How many time can Vaugh and Sydney walk into the room just minutes from Sark and Lauren?

On the good side, however, it was wonderful to see Marshall's character continue to develop. Don't be surprised to see Kevin Weisman with his own TV show when this is all over. Furthermore, the episode where Sydney finds out that it was herself that was hiding the history of the past two years is very creative and masterfully delivered.

All in all, I'm hooked for Season 4, but don't rest on your laurels. It better be more like Seasons 1 and 2 or this show won't be on much longer.",1119830400,4,1462,4.611538461538461
2005135,5,B0001I55ZQ,"The third season of Alias is great but not as good as the first or second season. You must watch the first two seasons before watching this season. I believe that the plot is amazing and that after watching all of these seasons you will feel like you know everything about the characters. This is a great series.

P.S. Watch the bloopers, they are fun.",1118361600,,352,4.415384615384616
2005136,5,B0001I55ZQ,"I just finished season 3 of Alias...and am wondering ""What the HELL happened in the last scene?""...season 4 dvds won't be out for a while....grumble grumble.

Anyway, I agree that season 3 wasn't as strong as season 2, but I enjoyed it more than season 1.  Season 1 (although I loved it as well) almost seems now like a prequel to the main attractions.  The parts of the show that suffered in season 3 were largely parts that I didn't care about.  I really don't care about ""Sydney and friends at home."", which there really isn't any of in this season.  If you really miss it that much, then watch half an episode, pause it, and go find a re-run of friends on tv....sadly, you can probably find these re-runs on SOME channel 24-7.  In addition, the new character simply isn't as interesting as the others.  We also have to deal with the absence of Sydney's mother in this season, and she is a large part of what made Season 2 great.

However, I really care mostly about 3 things in Alias, and they remain nearly at season 2 levels:

1. Characters- while I explained a couple of problems above, the returning characters are great.  Sloane gets even more interesting, Weiss and Marshall are further developed, and a couple of minor but interesting characters are introduced.

2. Action Scenes/Missions- no slouching here....the missions, costumes, fights, etc. continue to be over the top, well scored, and fun to watch.

3. MOST IMPORTANTLY...the PLOT- The plot for this season comes VERY close to season 2.  The middle is a little slow, but the beginning and end were great.  I watched the last six episodes in one sitting....something I have only previously done for 24.  The writers continue to be good at writing twists that make sense and manipulating viewer expectations.  There were several times where I thought the story had twisted in a way that would have invalidated some past events only to find out that the story was actually twisting a different way.  I really don't understand people that think this season had a fragmented story.  To me, the story continues to warp around revealing a larger, grander story with each season...things that didn't make sense 2 seasons ago make sense now...it's just....brilliant.  And I don't understand why everybody is tired of the Rambaldi stuff.  The Rambaldi story is the PERFECT frame for this type of show.  It enable endless opportunity for new important artifacts to race to and adds a slight supernatural edge to the show at times that can be really fun.  In fact, I think the Rambaldi storyline is one of the ways that Alias actually trumps 24.  24 is my favorite, but Alias has one long continous storyline...it doesn't even take a breath at the end of seasons.  When I heard that season 3 of Alias wasn't supposed to be as good as the others, I prepared for worst....it seems I was misled...the season was great (although uneven), and Alias continues to be one of the 4 best shows on tv (the others being 24, The Shield, and Lost).",1117152000,7,2992,4.687739463601533
2005137,3,B0001I55ZQ,"I really loved seasons 1 and 2 of Alias, but I found season 3 to be quite a disappointment.  The main reason for this is the excessive use of violence this season.  It's not necessary and actually detracts from the show.  I don't know why creators of shows like this thinks that people are drawn to excessive violence.

I was also very disappointed by the loss of scenes which included Sydney and her friends at home.

I was also disappointed by the absence of 2 key characters this season.  I know this may have been due to the actors wanting to leave, but I still felt it detracted from the show.

I am not sure if I will buy season 4 or not.  Hopefully the show has improved back to it's original greatness from the first 2 seasons.  Season 2 is my favorite.",1116720000,2,761,4.265734265734266
2005148,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Yes, Sydney really has been missing for two years.  And she comes back to find that Vaughn is married, her dad is in jail, and Sloane is a good guy.  Hold on to your hats, it's season 3.

Syd quickly begins to get back on her feet, going back to work for the CIA under her former partner Dixon.  But her search for the two years missing from her memory takes her to some pretty strange places.  Most shocking of all is the fact that she killed someone in cold blood.  It's beginning to look more and more like some group called The Covenant is involved.  What could this all mean?  And can she successfully work with Vaughn and his pretty new wife Lauren?

I have watched this show faithfully since day 1, becoming a die hard fan about episode three.  I faithfully tuned in for this season and spent as much time as always speculating on what each line of dialog and plot twist meant.  But it wasn't as entertaining as the first two seasons.  The twists felt forced, and the emphasis on Rimbaldi near the end overwhelmed me.  That's one storyline I'd love for them to completely leave behind.

This six disc set is up to the previous set's high standards even if the show isn't.  All 22 episodes are shown in wide screen and full surround sound.  There's a fan commentary, which is fun if not informative, and two commentaries with cast and crew.  Disc six contains an animated episode from Syd's missing two years (forgettable), and the usually behind the scenes stuff.  This is actually very interesting and I watched it all intently.  Also included are a handful of deleted scenes and the outtake real for the season.

While the show stumbled in season 3, it has regained its footing in season 4.  Fans will be glad they have this to complete their set.  Those catching up will need to see it as well to understand the current episodes.",1116547200,2,1839,4.45945945945946
2005149,5,B0001I55ZQ,"...but it is NOT that he let the series in some way down (as suggested by many, even himself, but IMHO he didn't), it is that unforgivable final scene which makes you put all the disks through again searching for hints as to what it is she is reading there in those dark sheets, especially given that you are wondering how a certain other person could have known about all this. So I guess the mystery will already be solved for the majority of people who read this, but for me it will be awhile longer until season four even gets onto TV, not to speak about DVD,  or even DVD which will not be encoded Region1. Long time of torture ahead...

Otherwise, despite some logic faults over the season (and be honest - there were those in seasons 1+2 as well),  it is still the best what ever happened on TV. Season 3 even rises above previous ones, even though it misses such a clearly defined killer episode such as Phase One has been previos season (I guess that will remain my favorite episode of any TV show for a long time).  Some plot twists are shocking,  actors performance is consistently above the standard (and it would be unfair to single out Jennifer Garner in this regard, although she IS stellar), and there are some especially nice character recurrences from previous seasons as well as a bunch of new guest stars.

The only thing I hated even more than the final scene was the hairstyle which Sydney features through the last third-or-so of the season.",1116460800,,1464,4.484962406015038
2005150,3,B0001I55ZQ,"I should start by saying that Alias is my favorite show on TV and I've been dedicated to it since the first season.

However, season three was a severe disappointment. It starts with the soap-opera-coma-like ""you've been missing for two years"", and procedes to the old ""you erased your own memory"" and ""you have a long-lost sister"". The worst clich&eacute; of the season, though, was BY FAR the addition of Lauren Reed, Michael Vaughn's wife. For a show known for its tight and believable characters, Mrs. Reed is embarassing. Her character is anti-Sydney one minute and her best friend another. Add to the mixture that she, of course, is EEEEVIL, and you have me rolling my eyes.

However, that's not to say that season three didn't have its good episodes; mainly the stand-alones Breaking Point and Facade, but Concious, Remnants, and Prelude also shine.

A previous reviewer was correct in naming Blowback as the worst episode of the series.

Thank goodness the writers and producers managed to put the show back on track with season four, or Lost may have become my prime show.",1114387200,5,1081,4.858695652173913
2005151,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Premiering in September 2001, Alias has built a steady and loyal following among television viewers. The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files. It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman. But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...

Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency. However, problems arise when her fianc is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all... In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent. Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work. Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...

The Alias (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Two"" in which Sydney, suffering from amnesia, desperately tries to uncover the truth about the past few years of her life. Meanwhile, the CIA puts her on a case which might possibly aid in her memory's recovery... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Reunion"" in which Sydney and Michael once again pair up on an assignment in order to halt an evil plot by Sark, and ""Conscious"" in which Sydney participates in a strange doctor's experiment to recover her earlier memories...

2005152,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Lots of die-hard Alias fans tend not to like season three as much as the previous two. According to an interview, even J.J. Abrams himself felt the show drifting, which motivated him to get it ""back on track"" for season four. Nevertheless there are quite a few gems, proverbial diamonds in the rough. And you have to hand it to them for taking some pretty substantial risks, including the introduction of Lauren Reed, a character so reviled in some circles that it was practically obscene. (Thankfully, most were willing to separate the character from the actress. Melissa George did quite well as Lauren, but she happened to be written in between Sydney and Vaughn. Not a fun job being put between one of TV's hottest couples.) Then there was the whole two-year amnesia bit--really out there, but you bought it anyway.

But that's the charm of the show, I think. No matter how ridiculous it gets--come on, the whole Rambaldi thing is as out there as any plot device gets, no pun intended--but you can't help but come back for more. And really, season three's greatest failing is that it had to live up to the seasons that came before it. With the departure of Merrin Dungey, Bradley Cooper, and most notably Lena Olin, it was as if an entire part of Sydney's life had dropped out of frame. I have to admit that I didn't warm to Will initially, but it was great to see him when he made his guest appearance. And the rest of the cast continued to give stellar performances, Victor Garber and Michael Vartan especially. And you can't help but love the guest appearances by Quentin Tarantino (reprising his season one guest role as McKenas Cole), Vivica A. Fox, David Carradine, Peggy Lipton, Justin Theroux...the list goes on.

So maybe season three wasn't the strongest, but it's still a hell of a contender. And it sets the stage for a reworked, re-energized season four.",1113523200,4,1871,4.683890577507599

So the concept of Sydney's missing years what a pretty implausible reach.  (and completely unexpected)  However, it was an interesting idea, while it took me a long time to accept, somehow it worked.

The whole Lauren/Vaughn tryst made me want to vomit, however JJ followed through and made her bad, so of course, the end of Sydney/Vaughn was not here.

However, when Sydney and Vaughn kissed in North Korea, that was BEFORE Vaughn and Sydney found out the truth, and that was my personal favorite moment of the season.  (with Damien Rice's ""Delicate"" playing in the background)

I pretty much hated the last few episodes, and the whole ""Sister"" named Nadia storyline to continue the Rambaldi prophesy was way too over the top for me.

The first flaw: Sidney couldn't be more stupid when she decided to erase her memory! Obviously she would like to know what happened in the 2 missing years.
The second flaw: the transformation of Lauren Reed. In the beginning, clearly Lauren was a good person and even naive. Suddenly, she turned into a murderer bitch working for the Covenant. That was totally pointless, it only worked to separate Sid and Vaugh for a while.
Overall this season is not that awful like some people say. But there are some of the worst episodes of Alias like After Six and Blowback. It's worth to watch it at least one time.",1110931200,3,623,4.621621621621622

2005168,4,B0001I55ZQ,"""Alias"" is creator J.J. Abrams' slick TV update of James Bond, Mission Impossible, and the Avengers for the 21st Century. Sure, it has about as much to do with the real CIA as a can of Chef Boyardee has to do with authentic Italian cuisine, but that isn't the point. Abrams has given his audience a delicious spy fantasy worthy of some of Ian Fleming's novels, and ""Alias"" is an incredible success on its own terms.

All ""Alias"" seasons thusfar are enjoyable, but the third season may be best suited for DVD. Abrams decided to weave individual episode plots into a larger story arc with three key components. Firstly, there's the mystery of agent Sydney Bristow(lead actress Jennifer Garner)'s amnesia for the past two years. Secondly, there's the rise of a new terrorist organization called the Covenant, featuring the villainous Sark (David Anders). Last, but not least, is the enigmatic (and supposedly reformed criminal mastermind) Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), and his attempts to manipulate and coerce those around him to do his bidding.

""Alias"" packs a powerful punch where other, similar series can only muster a limp wrist-slapping. Credit is due to Abrams' stress on family and interpersonal relationships, his creation of believable supporting characters, and an excellent array of character actors employed to bring Abrams' vision to life. Garner attracts most of the media's attention (and understandably so, since she's not only beautiful and talented but also possesses a charming girlish quality) - but it's the rest of the cast that kept me tuning in time and time again. Unlike ""Dark Angel,"" which debuted at around the same time, ""Alias"" prefers not to use its supporting characters as comic relief. I'm not entirely thrilled about the series' repeated interludes regarding the mysterious Renaissance ""prophet"" Rambaldi and his many inventions, but it does provide Abrams with a ""DaVinci Code""-style twist that traditional spy dramas don't have.

I can't and won't reveal any of the plot twists and turns. Taken as a whole, this is a very enjoyable 22 hours for anyone who likes cloak-and-dagger material. Even the extras make for fun viewing.",1109376000,2,2160,5.130681818181818

In fact i liked it more than season 2. True, the story is not as strong as the last season, but hey, most of the missions looked more of a swat team than cia spies, specially in the second half. In this season the missions go back to how they were. Great characters, environment, mistery, missions and characters from the past enrich this season more than the last one.

The season opener of this season just me away, one of the best episodes there have been, and the guest stars were superb. The character of Lauren was well done and mysterious, i think even more than Irina Derevko, since most of the time she was in a cell. The mistery leading up to the half season got me hooked and then the surprise with vaughn's wife made me stay.

However, it is true that there were a few mistakes in the way, the relationship between syd and vaughn looks like a classic sope opera, and kathya and jack's relationship is ridiculous as well as barnett and slone's. And yes, the story leading up to the end of the season was a bit stronger in season 2, but most that say it was a bad season are those who saw it in the tv, this season needs to be watched with certan fludity and continuty in order to appreciate it best.

2005173,4,B0001I55ZQ,"[About 3.5 stars, a letdown from prior seasons.]

I'm going to try something a little different for this review of ""Alias: The Complete Third Season"".  I'll start by telling you that ""Alias"" is still one of my favorite shows, and then I'm going to tell you about the worst episode of ""Alias"" to date, ""Blowback"", #14 of the third season.

In ""Blowback"" Sydney and Vaughn are (unknown to them) chasing Lauren and Sark to first find the location of a ""plasma charge"" in a data vault, and then find the plasma charge itself.  There's a product placement for Ford F-150 trucks that only lasts 1.5 minutes but was the main focus of planning for the show, as revealed in the DVD bonus material.  And much of the script is a tricky device showing the same scenes twice, from two different perspectives.  The writer for this turkey was Laurence Andries, and the director Lawrence Trilling, one of the literally dozens of producers on ""Alias"".

For a bomb of a type that he'd never seen, Marshall knew that detaching the blue wire and shorting the red and black wires together would both stop the countdown and render the external trigger inert.  (I guess there's an international standard wire color code for bombs that all terrorists follow.  That's certainly a comfort in these troubled times!)

At the data vault facility: ""Our telescopes generate over 350 gigabytes of information per day.""  ""Not a problem.  Our vaults are designed to accomodate teraFLOPs.  You can store 20 years of data in the vault you've leased.""  (This is like comparing apples and aardvarks.  A FLOP is a FLoating-point OPeration, a unit of processing power.  Data is in bytes, units of storage.  What's the lease rate on 2.5 petabytes, with twice-daily backup, anyway?  Whatever it is, it must be worth it because the approximately TEN THOUSAND drives in that room were *really* quiet.)

""Let me know when you're connected to the mainframe"" in the data vault.  (Must be what's generating all those teraFLOPs.  A real data vault needs a firewall and a high-speed traffic router; mainframes haven't been needed for mass storage since the 1980s.)

While downloading data from one of many rooms with 2 petabytes each, it's echoed scrolling across the antiquated white on black block text screen at about 1200 bps.  (I guess they assume you can wait 50,000 years for your data.)

The act of downloading data injects a virus into a running system.  Stopping the download on the sending end stops the spread of the virus on the infected receiving end.  (Even AOL users know viruses don't work this way.  Plus the CIA's virus detector tells you there's an infection by blanking the screen, but doesn't automatically stop the virus.  That's OK, though; Marshall is such a stud that he can manually quarantine the virus by typing commands furiously while the screen is still blanked.)

The Ford F-150 product placement was both blatant and ironic.  The irony of this Ford ""promotion"" was that it showed the F-150 truck could be stolen so fast that they could keep a Mustang fleeing the scene in sight; that's got to be less than 5 seconds.  Of course, the F-150 fishtailed at least twice trying to keep up with the Mustang.  In addition to its ease of theft, the F-150 was chosen because it could push a parked car out of the way.  Yet while the Mustang could push an obstructing non-parked car out of its way, the F-150 couldn't do the same.  (The bonus material showed they spent several days planning this car chase scene, and 12 hours shooting it.  Apparently this left no time for anybody to read the script.)

A ""plasma detector""?  Something that detects a gas so dispersed that the electrons aren't tied to any particular nuclei, with 100 feet of atmosphere and metal walls intervening?  (Puh-lease!  There's also the basic problem of an explosive sniffer being able to point to a source through metal ship decks, instead of following the air path to get there.  Or it having a fixed 100' straight line detection range, whether in open air or through multiple steel walls.)

Every time Syd and Vaughn point their Glock pistols, they make hammer-cocking sounds.  (Glocks don't have hammers.)

Sydney's generally got perceptions that would make Sherlock Holmes look myopic, yet she referred to the masked Lauren as ""him"".  (I must have missed the part of the briefing when they revealed that most male Covenant agents use mascara.  And one of these years the CIA's highly-trained agents will take the basic course that tells you not to stand within touching distance of someone when you have them at gunpoint.  But apparently not in 2004.)

Crack shot Syd obviously couldn't shoot Lauren running away in a straight, narrow corridor at a distance of 8 yards, so she didn't even bother to try.  And Sydney's a runner; she was a track star in high school and college.  She successfully runs away from pursuing enemies in practically every episode.  Yet she couldn't catch up with Lauren.  (Script armor is better than Kevlar PLUS a jet pack!)

In one of the DVD episode commentaries they mention that ""Alias"" episodes generally either shine or stink.  ""Blowback"" was quite the stinker.  Luckily for all of us there are still some shiny bits this season.  But be prepared to hold you nose occasionally for Season Three.  The acting is still top-notch, but the rest of the crew seriously needs to buy a clue.  I'm glad I bought my DVD set used; I'd be grumbling more if I paid full price.

Season 3 is bordering on the ridiculous. The acting is first rate; no complaints there. But the story arc is pure cartoon. There isn't a single moment of reality in that series. Everything about this season is ridiculous. But that's not the worst of it.
Other than Marshall (and sometimes Weiss), there is not one iota of humour here; even life's worst situations bring moments of funny if only to relieve the pressure. But season is absurdly serious - even more so than seasons 1 and 2 which weren't much better. I'm not saying it's not a good show overall. But it could be so much more if it didn't take itself so seriously. I suspect the show is popular with the younger macho crowd because of the excessive violence (and Jennifer!).
I'm hoping season 4 brings SOME semblance of reality and a bit more fun along with a bit less violence . Because overly earnest TV sucks. I own seasons 1 and 2 on DVD because they held some interest; there was good caracter development, intrigue and variety, but I won't be buying this one.

2005189,2,B0001I55ZQ,"The season finale of Alias season 2 was breathtaking.  The final fight between Sydney and faux-Francie had me on the edge of my seat, and then the cliffhanger was vintage J.J.Abrams.  Then it came back and it all went down the drain.

Vaugn's wife, Lauren, is for lack of a better word... lame.  The fact that she turns out to be (spoiler) evil is so cliched.  The fact that she is ineptly dating Sark and is bad at keeping the secret, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS A SPY, is pretty ridiculous.  And I think the big reveal about Sydney's memory loss-- that she did it to herself-- is weak storytelling.  I mean, how dumb is Sydney?  Doesn't she know herself well enough to know that she wouldn't accept a loss of TWO YEARS without an explanation to her memory-less self?  Or did she just not understand the concept of NOT REMEMBERING?  And don't even get me started on Indiana Sydney and the Temple of Rambaldi.

There are some good things about this season.  Dixon, Marshall and most of all Jack get a chance to shine.  But my firmest memory of this season is the moment when Sloane raises a stupid-looking green glowy hourglass over his hand and smashes it, with videogame cg-style, on the ground.  At that moment, I wanted to do the same thing to J.J.Abrams for wasting my time all  year.  Save your money and buy ""Lost"" when it comes out; it's much better.",1102032000,14,1349,4.444897959183673

But I have a real problem with Season 3 on DVD.  That is that it is too dark.  It seems that most scenes are so dark that we miss facial expressions and all the nuances of them.  I thought it was my television but we have just gotten a new one and it is just as bad.  It was so irritating trying to see it during the first disk, which was a little slow, that we just quit watching.

I realize that  it is a ""spy game"" and many things have to be done in the dark but it is ridiculous to suffer eyestrain from squinting just to be able to tell what is happening.  And then there are the fight scenes where everyone is wearing black  and when it is over you are wondering what happened since you couldn't see  even who hit who or how!!

But it is a great show and I have to recommend buying all 3 seasons even if you have to turn the contrast way up to see it--which we tried without much success.",1101686400,8,1168,3.8284518828451883
2005191,3,B0001I55ZQ,"How about that which made the first two seasons (Season 1 especially so great).  I think the show (and I could be speaking very prematurely here as JJ Adams is a genius on Whedon scale and could pull the show back to greatness) really jumped the shark in the second season when it killed off Francie and got rid of Will.  They were really the ones that I enjoyed and I found myself particularly watching the scenes when Syd was just being Syd and interacting with her friends.  What made the show great was the balance between her spy life and her real life and the fact that the show as like James Bond but more human and complex.

Season 3 devolved into Sydney crying every episode, Jack doing all the dirty work to protect his precious, weak little Syd, the Rambaldi arc getting out of control and lots of little side stories that were just naff.  I'm sorry but seeing a topless Ron Rifkin (I think the actor and character is genius though) made me gag ever so slightly.  I did enjoy Jack getting it on with Isabella Rosselini who I hope shows up again in Season 4 (""I think you're hot Jack, deal with it""  I love it!)  And the long-lost sister storyline was pretty much the nail in the meandering, nonsensical coffin that was Season 3.  Now that Greg Grunberg is getting his own series (yet another JJ brainchild), Sydney will have no friends and it'll be the Spy, Spy Daddy, Spy Boyfriend and Spy Partner (Dixon, whose character was just shelved and ruined by making him director of the Rotunda).  Bring back the Francinator and make her a big baddy instead of Sark's henchgirl/bed buddy!  I don't agree with the Amazon reviewer that Melissa George was lackluster but I think she could have had more luster.  I wasn't sad to see her go though and am not exactly clamoring to have her back.  Will, on the other hand, please, please, please restore this show to the greatness that it was for 2 brief seasons.",1101340800,18,1911,4.456896551724138
2005192,3,B0001I55ZQ,"Season 3 of Alias ups the ante in all areas: the drama is more heartfelt, the budget is higher, and the action is more plentiful.  In fact, for its first half, Season 3 is pretty much the best of Alias, until the series nosedives HARD halfway in, and abruptly degrades into some of the worst television I've ever seen.  After such a strong first half, it's disheartening that the show turns into what I could best describe as a live-action remake of the old ""GI Joe"" cartoon, as rewritten by children under the influence of Magic Marker fumes.  But hardcore Alias fans, please don't hit that ""review not helpful"" button yet!

Season 3 begins exactly where Season 2 left off: CIA super-agent Sydney Bristow awakens after a battle with a doppelganger of her best friend, only to find 2 years have passed.  A woman out of her time, Syd seeks to discover what happened to her, while at the same time make sense of and come to terms with the manifold changes in her life.  For one, former head villain Sloane now seems to be a redeemed champion of peace.  Syd's father Jack is in prison, though Syd takes care of this promptly.  Most importantly, Vaughn, Syd's love interest, is now married to a wenchy Federal agent who doesn't like Sydney in the least.

The unfolding suspense of Syd's missing years is nicely complimented by phenomenal action, as Syd battles ""The Covenant,"" a SPECTRE-type global organization that's basically the same as Season 1's The Alliance.  Whereas Season 2's action was an improvement over Season 1's ""Buffy""-type shenanigans, Season 3 is the best yet.  Season 2 thankfully admitted that a spy needs MORE than just a wig and a few martial arts moves to survive, and in that season Syd carried some weaponry and took out several foes.  In Season 3 she's become a full-scale Terminator, wasting enemies left and right and always carrying a weapon.  Makes you chuckle at the Season 1 episode where she bawled over  killing someone on a mission.

But this is also where Season 3 fails.  Sark, the blonde-haired, English-accented Sloane footstool of Season 2, is back, and he acts as Syd's foil throughout.  Seriously, no matter where in the world Syd is, Sark will show up to throw a monkeywrench in the works.  This gets old fast, and each time Syd just knocks the guy out and runs away.  She could just save herself so much heartache by just pumping a round in the guy's head, like, you know, a real spy would do.  Especially when you consider all of the people Sark has murdered.  And especially when you consider how much of a thorn Sark gradually becomes in Sydney's side over the course of this rocky season.

However the main problem with Season 3 is the quick wrap-up of Syd's missing years, midway through the season.  At first it's hinted that Syd was used by the Covenant as an assassin, but this engaging idea is dropped mercilessly and unconvincingly, in one single episode.  This same episode also features the unwelcome return of Season 1's hokey ""chosen one"" subplot, which denigrates the series into cheap ""Buffy"" sub-standards.  That being said, this episode also features one of the series' best action scenes, as Syd et al parachute into a Covenant base and raise havoc on full auto.

After this episode, things get worse and worse.  The ""chosen one"" junk takes predominance, and whereas the first half of the season was a taut action thriller about globe-trotting spies, the latter half becomes mired in prophecies, annoying villains, and completely stupid and unnecessary character revelations (in what can only be seen as something the writers came up with during a lunch break, a main character discovers that he/she has a sister; another character is revealed to be evil, a cheap revelation which completely undermines the drama and emotion of preceding episodes).  It's kind of the reverse of Season 2, which started off poorly but revamped itself for a strong second half.

But on to the good stuff.  Let's talk about the action again, just for a minute.  Car chases, explosions, martial arts (still not as believable as the krav maga techniques on ""24,"" though), and gunfights galore.  Nice use of blood quibs, too.  Season 3 is pretty gory.  Usually on TV, a person just falls down when shot, but here the blood flows freely.  In other good points, the high production values make each episode seem like a glossy feature film.

The two other big positives: one, Syd's mother is mercifully out of the picture.  Man, the soap-operatic melodrama between her and Syd in Season 2 drove me to drink.  Jettisoning her character freed the show in a big way.  And two, there is a wonderfully diminished amount of crying this season, at least for the first half.  In previous seasons, Syd cried every five minutes, but here entire episodes will pass, unbelievably, without her shedding a tear.  It's good to see our girl growing up.

Guest stars aren't as irritating this time out, with even Vivica Fox presenting herself in fine fashion (though she did look a bit ridiculous running and firing an M-16 at the same time).  Quentin Tarantino makes a welcome return as smarmy rogue agent McKennas Cole, completely blowing the similarly-styled Sark character out of the water.  The best guest performance by far is courtesy director David Cronenberg, as an easygoing, drug-dabbling explorer of the mind.

So in the end, I'm just some anonymous Amazon reviewer who has a problem with the season.  But bear in mind that series creator and producer JJ Abrams agrees, publicly stating that he'd lost his way with Season 3 and planned to re-tool the show.  Let's hope he fixes it up right.  Alias has the potential to be a great show, with strong production values and a strong cast.  But this season it shoots itself in the foot by trying to become something that it's not.",1100476800,11,5804,4.767535070140281
2005193,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Although not quite as incredible as the last two seasons, season three is still full of intrigue and fun.  The DVD extras are worth watching, especially the commentaries with the actors and staff members.  Of the three seasons, this season's extras are definitely the best.

2005194,4,B0001I55ZQ,"At the beginning of season three of ""Alias,"" Sydney Bristow is supposedly ""back from the dead"" after two years of being gone, with many changes having taken place while she was away, and she is re-instated to CIA work almost immediately. I found this quite implausible, as I'd imagine the intelligence community would have at least a few pointed questions for her about her whereabouts for the last two years, which she can't remember at all.

This is one example of a number of problems that plagued this season of ""Alias."" The problem with season three isn't suspense or action -- there's still plenty of both to be had here. However, in an effort to keep it moving the writers seem to have overlooked a few gaping plot holes right off the bat, and this occurs several times through the story.

Mind you, there are some truly standout episodes in this season too. The danger of the Alliance has been replaced by a new, more sinister organization: the Covenant. Rambaldi artifacts continue to play a major part, and get more and more complex as the story progresses. Both Sydney and Vaughn go through some pretty significant character changes for this season, and where some found this a letdown, I found it refreshing, especially in Vaughn's case. Michael Vaughn was a character who was languishing in the world of being the eternal ""boy scout,"" and finally in this season we start seeing a different side of him peeking out.

The special effects of the series are definitely getting better, and the situations (and the costumes!) Sydney gets herself into are just as outlandish as ever. This has always been part of the fun in this show, and they definitely keep that aspect going here.

The surprising guest stars continue to crop up as well, including Djimon Hounsou of ""Gladiator"" fame, Vivica A. Fox, and a repeat appearance of Quentin Tarantino reprising his role from the first season. Meanwhile the tried and true folks, such as Ron Rifkin, Victor Garber, and the impressive Jennifer Garner continue to light up the screen. This season I have developed a real liking for Jack Bristow, Victor Garber's character, and was glad to see that Greg Grunberg got more screen time as Eric Weiss, perhaps the most geuninely likable character in the show.

All in all, this third season of ""Alias"" suffers a bit because the writers are overreaching a tad. There are a few times when the story seems to get out of control and the resulting effects on the characters are, to be kind, implausible. I would have liked to have seen more of the tight, carefully-written aspects of the first two seasons. But despite this, ""Alias"" is still the most addictive show on television these days, and I look forward to the fourth season (starts in January!) anxiously.  In the commentary on the third season discs, Abrams says that the developments in the third season will have a larger effect on the story as a whole, and suggests that seeming inconsistencies will be explained. The man has definitely earned enough of my respect that I feel I can trust him to make good on that promise.

Just keep it rolling, that's all I ask.",1099872000,4,3115,4.7467652495378925
2005205,3,B0001I55ZQ,"Frankly in previous seasons I sometimes found it distracting when Sydney returned to her secret identity and interacted with her friends.  I didn't realize how important it was until I watched Season 3 and realized how of Sydney's 'real' character only came out in these interactions.  Without this and without the amazing range of emotions provoked in the last season by her mother, Sydney anf the show that revolves around her seemed less than they had previously.  Perhaps to compensate there was an attempt to raise the level of the action and a greater reliance on flashly gadgets and special effects.  But without the human element of the show it simply became too difficult to maintain my suspension of disbelief.

This season begins where the Season 2 finale ended, with Syd discovering that she has been presumed dead by her friends, family and colleagues for 2 years.  She has no recollection of this period, which drives her on a crusade to recover her lost memories.  Along the way she discovers that her world has changed in her absense <SPOILER WARNING>; her partner Dixon is now an adminstrator at the CIA; her father is in prison (though she quickly manages his release and reinstatement); her mother has disappeared without a trace; her friend Will is in witness protection; the villainous Sloane has become a philanthropist and ally of the CIA (and if you believe that I have a great bridge for sale); and most traumatically her beloved Vaugh has moved on and remarried (which has dire consequences throughout the season).  <END SPOILER> This is all very interesting, but some of it is gratuitous and some of it just plain doesn't work (the Vaughn situation in particular), leading to later attempts at triage that just muddy the waters further.  There are some exciting developments on the Rambaldi front, and an effective new villainous organization called the Covenant, but it is all built on the shaky foundation of Syd's shattered life and growing obsession.  Basically, I believe that this was a problem of implementation. The season had the required elements to still be great, but there was a failure of vision from the top down about the important emotional and character driven elements of the show.  J.J. Abrams has virtually admitted this in interviews and seems to have some good ideas to revive the franchise next season.  I still love the show and hope to see a return to the more sucessful story-telling and character driven action of previous seasons.",1099526400,8,2486,4.9352517985611515
2005206,3,B0001I55ZQ,"The merits of Alias are obvious if you watch seasons one and two. They lost their way in the third season, with frenetic action taking over -- taking too much time away from personal and interpersonal drama, characters acting out of character, and plots that were unbelievable even within the framework of a fantasy/spy/romance show. On any whim, the guys and gals would leave the CIA to go off on some rogue mission (where do they get the funding for all these insane worldwide operations?) and be back in time for supper, with no permanent repercussions.

I don't know if the Rambaldi stuff will ever go anywhere or not. But what made Alias special was the relationships anyway. And these have been folded, spindled, and mutilated in season 3. The season finale looks like another ""good guy"" is going to turn out to be a betrayer. I won't say who, but it is horrible that they spent three seasons building up a special relationship between two people who had big issues at the beginning of the series, and now it looks like they want to destroy all the trust that was built. Perhaps they are simply running out of ideas, and they are simply going to destroy all the characters we have grown to love, like one of those sick John Irving novels.

I never saw the series on TV, and I'm glad I've been able to watch the DVDs. I'm all caught up on the plot (implausible as it became) and ready for season four to begin in January. But unless they return to some of the scriptwriting sense and character consistency of the first and second seasons, I'm going to give up on it. I hope they can get back in the game.

2005207,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Two years have passed for Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) since her fight with Allison Doren (Merrin Dungey).  A lot has happened... and she doesn't remember a thing.  Syd wakes up to find Dixon (Carl Lumley) as the head of CIA brach she worked for, Weiss (Greg Grunberg) is now a major player, her friend Will (Bradley Cooper) is now in Witness Protection, Jack (Victor Garber), her father, is now in prison for collaborating with her mother, Irina Direvko (Lena Olin), an enemy of the state who is still missing, Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), Syd's old nemesis, is now a philanthropist/humanitarian, and her old boyfriend Vaughn (Michael Vartan) is no longer with the CIA and is married to Lauren Reed (Melissa George), and member of the National Security Council (NSC).  And that's all in the first two episodes.  The first half of the season revolves around Syd trying to learn about her missing two years through a variety of leads, all of which tend to come to dead ends.  One of the more interesting (read bizzare) episodes involves a drugged-out doctor and his equally spacy assistant who specialize in neuro recovery research.  At the same time, Syd learns that she killed a Russian diplomat while she was gone, and it turns out that the man was Mr. Sark's (David Anders) father, and with Sark's new inheritance, he joins a new terrorist group known as The Covenant.  The Covenant is a group of Russians who are trying to bring about the fulfillment Rambaldi's prophecies.  Eventually, Director Kendall (Terry O'Quinn) returns to fill Syd in on the past.

The next half of the season involves the search for ""The Passenger"", another key player in Rambaldi's prophecies.  The CIA wants to find them in order to prevent The Covenant from using the Passenger to bring about destruction.  However, unbeknownst to the CIA, the Covenant has a mole in the LA branch that Syd works in.

This season, much like 24's third season, is not as good as the preceding two.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very good television show, and it was much better than the majority of programming that was on at the same time, it just doesn't stand up to the amazing second season.  There was a little too much melodrama and not enough actual drama.  Also, a lot of the characters were present even when they weren't needed.  The biggest offender was Carrie (Amanda Foreman) whose only purpose was to be there as Marshall's (Kevin Wiessman) girlfriend/wife.  Sark was a regular, but he was not needed in every episode (even though I think Sark is an awesome character, I think that it's better that he's only going to be a recurring character next year).  Finally, there is Weiss.  He was used a lot at the beginning (it seemed as if he was going to be a new love interest for Syd at the beginning), then his use dropped off a little, then he came back again towards the end.  I must say that I like Weiss, and it seems like he's the character who tends to get the short end of the stick (like Lorne in Angel or Xander in the last two seasons of Buffy).  He is a bit of a ""punching bag"" and is vastly overlooked by writers and fans.

All in all though, this is still good TV despite not being quite up to Alias standards.  Only a few months until season 4...",1098489600,2,3240,4.577123050259965
2005208,4,B0001I55ZQ,"[spoilers follow] Although I found myself rather disappointed with Season 3 when it aired, I ordered the DVD because I needed my Alias fix while waiting for Season 4 in January. And I discovered something quite surprising: Despite its obvious flaws, Season 3 was actually really, really good--much better than I had remembered.

First, the flaws:  With JJ Abrams out of the picture for the most part, the show lacked a coherent story arc. The writers took what should have been a season-long mystery--Sydney's disappearance and missing memory--and shot their wad halfway through the season. This was the point at which things began to fall apart. Without a clear story arc to pursue, the writers threw in every plot device they could think of, introducing yet another new secret society (The Trust), yet another new Rambali endgame (The Passenger), and then yet another Rambaldi endgame (The Sphere of Life), yet another bunch of moles (Mrs. Reed, Katya), yet another long-lost relative, and more. Although the lack of Bradley Cooper and Lena Olin was painfully obvious (especially in light of Michael Vartan's wooden acting), and although losing the very real menace that Sloane presented left Sydney without a worthy foil, it was the decline in the writing that was the true weakness. Consider the rampant use of these four contrivances:  1) The ticking time bomb that gets defused with 1 second left, 2) The revealing document that only the character onscreen gets to read--we never see it, 3) Electro-shock as a torture device and 4) The love triangle. The fact that the writers kept coming back to these things time and again makes it clear they just ran out of things to say. The kicker was the masks used in the final episode. They were stupid in Mission Impossible, and even more so here.

But with all this said, the season was better than you've been led to believe by many of these reviews. The missing-time mystery was a great plot device, and there were countless scenes that recalled the best moments of Alias past, such as the scene where Sydney fingers Vaughn as her ""supplier"", all while she's got a knife to her throat, and they race to give him an immediate criminal record. The series also took a darker turn, with a lot more blood being shed. But real terrorist organizations are nasty, so this change isn't so unwelcome. The episode where Will returned was bittersweet, because it's obvious how much the show used to rely on his screen presence. What's interesting, too, is that things that struck me as flaws during the original airing were actually explained well--I just wasn't paying close enough attention. Why didn't Lauren turn in Sloane to the Covenant when he became a double agent? It's because she was a sleeper agent, and hadn't been contacted by the Covenant in years. What was Sloane's secret endgame that Lindsey referred to? Well, it was really nothing more than his daughter. The best part is, the season finale, despite all its weirdness (Vaughn flies from LA to Palermo in 3 hours?), set up some good stories for Season 4, most notably new revelations about Project Christmas. With Jeff Bell (The X-Files) on board for next season, things are definitely looking up.

So whether you're an Alias addict or just looking for some good television to watch on your laptop, get this DVD set (but only after watching the first two). It's great television, and great fun.",1098403200,6,3403,4.860344827586207
2005209,4,B0001I55ZQ,"For those of you who are big alias fans you'll love this season, but you must bare in mind taht it it very different from the previous two. Mostly because it is two years later and she comes back and you sort of realise that she doesn't have a personal life anymore. But the great thing about this season is that the character who plays Lauren is delightfully evil in the same way that you love to hate Snape in the Harry Potter series. I still love Alias, I'm just not sure taht this would be the season that I would buy first, just because Sydney is not her happiest, like the entire season and I wouldn't want people to get the impression that that it the way the entire series is, becaues it's not. For the most character development try the first season, not that the second isn't awesome too.",1098316800,,798,4.291390728476821
2005210,3,B0001I55ZQ,"For an action/adventure series Alias is one of the best & 3rd season continues with great location/set work and some good ideas.

2nd season ended with Sydney awakening in a Hong Kong alley after the attack in her home and learning that she's lost two years of her life and Vaughn has long since married another woman.

As the season runs along we learn more about what happened to her and the rest of the former SD-6 crowd (Marshall Finkmann is now the CIA gadget guy- sort of believable while Dixon is CIA section chief- too high a post for a former suspect, unbelievable). Her SD-6 boss, Sloane, is now the head of an international charity, never sure where his loyalties lie or what his motives are (very confusing)while Irina Derevko has disappeared (Lean Olin wouldn't come back to the show)her replacement- a younger sister played by Isabella Rosselini (she's good but looks nothing like Olin,this subplot wasn't very well handled).

Along the way we see some good stories, great location work ( I like the way the show creators go to the trouble of casting extras who look like someone from the country a set is supposed to be in)lots of twists and turns including the new enemy, something called ""The Covenant"" and the fact that Vaughn's wife is a double agent for them. Sydney's discovery of a sister near season's end was a real twist, I'm waiting to see how the writers develop that one and the renewed Rambaldi subplot.

The series is well worth watching and owning, I just hope that somebody gets around to tying together all the loose threads left hanging everywhere.",1097884800,2,1582,4.700361010830325
2005211,5,B0001I55ZQ,"My Alias while in viewing limbo was ""Couch Potato.""  This series promises to suck the viewer in.  I remember watching a couple of episodes of season 3 on television, and being very intrigued, however very confused as well. Deciding to rent a disc at the video store to get to the bottom of it all, I found myself returning twice and sometimes three times in one day (ahh!) to pick up the next disc.  I ate my meals in front of Alias, and when sleep overcame me, I had grandiose dreams that I was Jennifer Garner, traveling all regions of the world, kicking terrorist butt!  I admit it was a bit much, I had absolutley no social life while getting through all three seasons, but I cannot wait until season four starts.",1097539200,7,717,4.409090909090909
2005212,3,B0001I55ZQ,"I almost feel bad for rating this season so low, but after the first two seasons, it's not unreasonable to hold Alias to a higer standard than we see here.

I absolutely guarantee you that no office, CIA or otherwise, would tolerate the amount of lovelorn crap that dominates this season of television.  Seriously.  Let's have a workgroup that consists of a man, his wife, his former lover, and the former lover's dad.  And it's not like these relationships are particularly secret.  There.  I said it.

Screenwriting 101: To create tension where there is none, write a love triangle.

High standards are a double-edged sword.  Season 3 lives up to that standard in many ways.  Jennifer Garner, et al, turn in the same fantastic performances we've come to expect.  There are some genuinely unexpected twists, and some really complex subplots.  The absence of Lena Olin and Bradley Cooper is sorely felt, but it's not a gaping void.  Putting an actor of Ron Rifkin's caliber in the background is criminal.  Melissa George is terrible.  David Anders is great, but his character lost some of his dimensions.  Like, two of his three.

Screenwriting 102: When in doubt, have a bomb with a timer.  Gets ya every time, doesn't it?

They really did start out strong, though.  Season 2's cliffhanger established what could have been a two (or even three!) year story arc that could have guided the writers the same way the SD-6 arc did for the first year and a half.  And instead, it's a sideline plot for 10 episodes, wrapped up in 1 episode, and then swept aside while the show drifts rather aimlessly.

Screenwriting 103: Everything has a remote control with handy red and green lights.

What made SD-6 and the Alliance a great enemy was the fact that  we saw them every once in a while.  Keeping the Covenant so nebulous and far removed from the audience diminishes the tension that's derived from their spooky name.  The big bads we see are the likes of Sark, Cole, and Lauren.  They're young and hip and have great hairstyles.  Blofeld, they ain't.  Rather, I'd describe them as being prissy; more like TV lawyers than anything else.  Not all that scary.  The writers failed to sell the threat here.

Screenwriting 104: If it worked once, try doing it ten more times.

The remarkable thing, though, is the fact that the show survives.  It does a lot of things wrong, and doesn't live up to its legacy, but it's still not bad.  For me, and probably for the network as well, the next season will either make or break Alias.  It's in the sophomore slump; if it comes out, it'll be stronger than ever.  If it doesn't, then... well... if it goes downhill from here, it won't be much of a loss, will it?",1097452800,8,2694,4.63135593220339
2005213,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias's 3rd season gets its due from this DVD set.  It looks great on TV - the colors are vivid and striking.  Resolution is terrific.  At no points is there any graininess - a problem with some TV shows on DVD.

There is one catch - if you buy this without having seen the season, I'd recommend avoiding the special features until you finish.  Some of the ones on discs 1-5 do contain spoilers.

There are a few nice features on the 6th disc.  We get the usual hilarity from the outtakes reel (it's breathtaking to realize that Victor Garber can both smile and laugh while not in character).  There's a nice featurette on how the show handles locations.  Also, there's a great feature on the show's guest stars, including a hilarious interview with Ricky Gervais (best known as the boss from The Office).

The Season 3 storyline has some causes for disappointment for those who really liked the second season.  A few people are conspicuously missing and a few plot elements seem like retreads.  Still, it's a riveting season.  It moves nicely and has some wonderfully dramatic moments.  Between the DVD features, the image quality and the storyline, these are well worth buying.",1097366400,4,1179,4.715686274509804
2005214,4,B0001I55ZQ,"While not as exciting and intense as the first 2 seasons, Alias's third season still proves it's one of the best television shows on the air. Boasting some of the finest actors working today, starting with the magnificant Jennifer Garner, who should have won the emmy this year based her performance in the season opener, it's truly heartbreaking.  Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan, Greg Grunburg, and David Anders are all phenomenal. The storyline this year isn't as ""edge of your seat"" like last year but it did keep my interest and it does build to an excellent climax. The beginning is all about trying to find out what happened to Syndey, and we finally find out in the amazing episode Full Disclosure, but the majority of the season is based on Lauren, Vaugns wife who is obviously not who she says she is, and the final episode gives us another shocking cliffhanger. I think the major disappointments was Melissa George who played Lauren. She's quite boring and was a sad replacement for the wonderful Lena Olin, so it was hard to get into any of her scenes, and she just didn't fit in with the remarkable cast.
Leno Olin, Bradley Whitford(Will), and Merrin Dungey(Francie) are also gone, with a guest appearance in a few eps from  Will and Francie. However, it still was an amazing season and I will can't wait for Season 4.",1096761600,3,1341,4.702127659574468
2005225,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Firstly, if you are an Alias Fan, there isn't really any point in reading this, or any other review.  In fact, you probably already own the DVDs, and have no reason to read this!  Secondly, if you are new to Alias, start at the beginning, and get all 3 seasons, because as far as true - and original - entertainment goes, you can't get better value for your money.  Alias 3, contrary to what some people might say, is not the weakest of the 3.  It's more realistic to compare it to the 1st season, in which we are introduced to Sidney Bristow's strange world.  That's how season 3 starts, and by the time it finishes, you wonder what on earth is going on.  It seems clear to me that creator JJ Abrams is taking the story down a different road - perhaps to peak our interest, or because, in part, certain actresses (Lena Olin) don't want to come back.  Either way, it seems clear that we are still at the beginning of a story, and, as with any story, we need to be patient as it unfolds.  As brilliant as the series is, however, I am still left wishing that David Anders (Sark) would do better at his supposed-British accent.  I would say the same for Melissa George (Lauren), however, I seem to think that she is SUPPOSED to sound like some sort of Australian/British/American cocktail.  As for extras, once again, I don't see the logic in the choice of episodes that have commentaries, and do wish that the fan commentary had remained but an idea in someone's head.  There is one bit of the Gag Reel in particular that caused me to laugh ridiculously loudly, and that's because you don't ever think of Jack as being funny or crude.  If there were a prize for silliest dialogue in a series, it would have to be for a conversation between Vaughn and someone who worked with his father.  The guy asks, ""Are you so-and-so's (can't remember his name) kid?""  Vaughn answers, ""That's right.  He was my father.""  In closing, I would compare the 3rd season to a good meal: you find yourself wanting seconds!  Bring on Season 4!",1096329600,4,2019,4.428184281842818

I'm enjoying the Season 3 DVDs a bit more than the run of Season 3 itself, if only b/c I can play the episodes consecutively and don't have to endure the many gaps between episodes that hurt the third season.  The DVDs are lacking in audio commentary from much of the cast.  (As far as I can tell thus far, Jennifer Garner, Greg Grunberg and Melissa George are the only 3 cast members to provide commentary.)  The ultimate fan commentary does not make up for these omissions.  The bonus features, however, are entertaining, especially the animated Alias (which could've been longer).  Despite not ever thinking myself much of a bloopers person, I find the gag reels entertaining year after year.  Also, I'm told there's an Easter egg on disc 5.

I still miss the additional storylines involving Sydneys personal life, (Will, Francie, etc...) but all in all this season was still better than most of the stuff that's on tv.  The DVD package is good, beautifully packaged and packed full of great extras.

But owning the set and watching at my own pace the show seems totally different when viewed one show right after the other.  I think it's right on and just as good as seasons one and two.  I think shows like Alias and 24 need to be shown week to week without breaks and that is why season 3 looked disjointed.  I believe that is why season 4 will be shown week to week without any breaks......it will help the ratings and bring in more viewers.  So having said that I believe you should buy season 3 and watch it without interrupations......you'll see it's as great as the other seasons.  The ONLY differance I see between this season 3 and seasons 1 and 2 is that Syndey ""lost"" her down time from the missions.  Then again it was a season about her being ""lost"" and with that in mind the season was GREAT!!!!!",1094947200,4,1079,4.219512195121951
2005245,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Hold the horses.  There are all running away.  ALIAS is THE BEST(!!) show on television.  OK, it hit a bump this season, granted, I'll let you have that point.  Now, all of you who lost faith this season, give it another go come January, don't lose faith in our beloved show yet.  They're going to fix.  Please don't let them cancel it.  If they do, I will cry, and never speak to another living soul, until I can write and produce its substitute (which would probably never happen) so don't let it get cancelled.

But, alas, I must move onto the point of this review.  I hated Season Three.  It angered me.  Lauren was a silly plot contrivance, now that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it, becuase you should now I will attempt to explain what I mean.

Fundamentals that were taken from us:

Lena Olin-I wish I could tell her how much we miss her so that she could understand.  PLEASE come back.  WE love you!

Ron Rifkin-We had him, but we didn't have Sloane.  We turn on the television and there he is.  All we want say, ""Hey, get off the stage you sick clone, we want the real Sloane back.""  Sloane having an affair. ICK!  Worst of all, Sloane always has an agenda, and it is always partially made known to us, Season 1 and 2, Rambaldi obsession.  Season 3, big unknown.  First, its his desire for redemption, then he's a double agent, that story arc last for five episodes, it kinda unraveled, then he in search of his daughter, meanwhile they get the daughter only to slam our beloved Irina Derevko into the dirt.

However, stay with me.

The things that make brilliant, though the entire season was subpar for ALIAS, but head and shoulders above most of it competition.

Jennifer Garner-she never ceases to amaze us with her brilliant acting.  ""The Two"" give us her best acting ever.  She attacks Vaughn with sharpness of a stiletto, yet while leaving sobbing for her, as her toughness melts away and we see her true shattered, vulnerable self.  (Great fight scene, emotionally)  The seventh episode begins with an incredibly shocking twist, leaving us breathless again at her immense acting talent.  Finally, she is absolutely shattered in ""Full Disclosure"" learning that she may never be able to bear children because of the evil spy trade she had so long fought against and long to rid her life of.

Victor Garber-a nasty, and more gentle SpyDaddy.  Great development in his character.

Mia Maestro- though the whole Sydney's sister is a little out there, she brings new acting blood with incredible talent to the show, showcased in episode 21 where she tells Sloane how she longed for a father as an orphan child, though if she knew who she was waiting for she would have gladly been adopted.

Melissa George-give the gal some credit.  She played the most hated woman on television.  She did a charming and graceful job, playing my most hated character on television, and for that I give her my respect.  I hate her character, though I do not feel she is a bad actress.  Her scenes with Garber and Garner are amazing showing what true talent and chemistry she has as an actress.  She and Vartan, were not the best matched for playing husband and wife in my opinion.  Kudos.  (Nothing as good and Olin and Garber.  By the way Sloane, you think you have the cake at manipulation, back-stabbing, and knife-twisting, that award goes to the Season Two co-Queen Irena Derevko.)

Great guest stars.

Great episode: the Two, Full Disclosure, and the Hourglass.

As many have said the individual parts are greater that the whole.  The whole is not grand and glorious like the 1 and 2, but the anticipation of project Christmas being an active operation with Sydney centered in it, and the sheer brokenness of what she gave us at the end of Season 3, because of what she had read, promises us a brilliant 4th season.  Don't miss it in January of 2005, ABC Sunday 9/8c (hopefully, the time and day may change becuase of the new line-up)

If you are going to buy this, make sure you own Season 1 and 2, or have at least watch them, otherwise you may be a little lost.",1094774400,,4065,4.557399723374827

2005248,3,B0001I55ZQ,"The end of season 2 left quite a job for season 3, and for a while, it feels like Alias will pull it off.  But suddenly, somewhere in the second half of the season, it loses steam.  I wonder what the point that it happened was, because the season's best episode - the full throttle ""Full Disclosure"" - comes right in the center of the season, giving brilliant breadth to Sydney's trauma, and establishing the season's great sleight-of-hand - just when we thought we could trust Lauren (Melissa George), she becomes the villain.  Many fans disagree with me, but I think George's Lauren is the one thing the season has going for it - she's a sexy, vicious villainness, a grand vixen you love to hate.  Unfortunately, though, as the plots start to turn more towards Rimbaldi, Lauren and Vaughan and away from Sydney (she does very little of note after she discovers the truth in ""Full Disclosure), we lose interest fast.  Michael Vartan, it turns out, isn't much of an actor, and his increasing instability is tough to swallow.  And as the Rimbaldi plotlines become grander and grander, they become too silly for words, climaxing into the embarassing 11th hour addition of a sister that adds nothing to the season, nor to Sydney.  The action is still exciting, for the most part, and as always, Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber (more excitingly ruthless than ever) are terrific.  The season, though, gets so big, it eventually explodes, which, unfortunately for us, leaves just scraps this time around.",1094601600,4,1500,4.809338521400778
2005249,5,B0001I55ZQ,"I missed the majority of episodes that comprised the third season of ALIAS so I was understandably anxious to get my hands on this six-disc DVD set of what is one of my few delights on television these days.
This DVD set is simply stunning in both presentation and content.
The packaging for these shows have always offered something surprising and this season is no exception. As was the case with the second season we have here a slip-over case that reveals additional artwork once it is removed. What I found of particular interest however is the attractive plastic accordion method for storing the DVDs. Gone are the keepcases for each disc, instead we have separate plastic `pages' each containing one disc. There is also a handsomely put together booklet detailing short synoposis of each show and details of the special features.
The end of the second season left CIA agent Sydney Bristow in what can be described as one of the best cliffhanging moments in television history. Waking up after falling unconscious following a particularly brutal fight in her home Sydney is shocked to discover that two years have passed - two years of which she has no memory. Furthermore everyone (except for a couple of people) believed her to be dead. The main thrust of the third season is Sydney's quest to uncover the truth about those missing two years and find her way back into the trust of the CIA.
Many things have changed in the intervening years. Dixon is now the head of CIA operations, Vaughn is married and has left the agency to teach French and Sydney's father is imprisoned for working with her traitorous mother in a determined quest to learn the truth of Sydney's whereabouts. Also, Sydney's arch nemesis Sloane is now a trusted CIA informant.
Firstly the performances in the third season of ALIAS are uniformly excellent. The entire cast (especially Jennifer Garner, Ron Rifkin and Victor Garber) and Kevin Weisman is in top comic form as techno-genius (the Q of the ALIAS universe) Marshall.
The plotting of these episodes also moves along at a brisk pace and (in what will come as no surprise to devotees of the show) they are both engaging and intriguing.
Of particular interest is the audio commentary that accompanies the first episode of the season. Rather than having members of the cast and crew do the commentary we are instead treated to a fan commentary. Two real-life ALIAS fans speak on the shoe and there observations and comments are more engaging than the typical commentaries.
Jennifer Garner herself can be heard on a commentary on the third disc. This commentary is good humored and actually very funny, especially when Ken Olin (the director of the episode) does an imitation of Garners mother.

2005253,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Don't get me wrong.. Season 3 was good, very good in fact... but only when you're watching it. After you've seen an episode you kinda tend to think ""wait.. that was pretty lame"". It's true to say that Alias went off the rails and lost itself during this 3rd season.. even the amazing creator J.J. Abrams said this. But don't give up on the show yet...........Season 4 promises to be ""AMAZING"" Alias is getting new writers who have worked on TV Shows such as Angel and Buffy - and this means GOOD! Abrams even went on to say that he's so excited about this 4th season that he thinks its how the show should have started off back in season 1.

Another factor to consider is that the character of Irina (Lena Olin) does not want to return to the show.. mainly cos shes a stupid girl who objects to working on tv shows but only movies. (crazy i know) and the writers were probably scrambling for something... enter Lauren Reed. I have to say however that having her as a double agent was not a bad idea completely.... instead of playing it out the way they did (which has been done soooo many times on probably every tv show ever) it would have been better maybe to not have her revealed at all (to the audience or the characters) but instead have her killed and then a later revelation that she was in fact bad... ==> opens gate for syd and vaughn to get it on.

But, anyway... Alias will return in Season 4.. and i have absolutely no doubt that it will return bigger, badder and better than ever. Please don't give up on it.. we need viewers cos otherwise our show will probably end up on the ever growing Cancelled pile.

2005254,4,B0001I55ZQ,"The first two seasons of Alias were outstanding.  Season 3 on the other hand, had some problems.  The cliffhanger at the end of season 2 left all Alias fans salivating over the much anticipated third year.  The problem is, after about ten episodes, the show seemed to be failing to deliver what season 2 promised.  But the more I watched, I realized that while most Alias fans would wish season 3 never happened, I think creator JJ Abrams was thinking about the big picture.  Yes, I wish that we saw more of Sydney's personal life and introduced some new friends for her to keep her grounded, and the whole Rambaldi plot was out of control.  On the other hand, without such storylines and plots laid out, the biggest plotline, and the cliffhanger at the end could not have been written.  I will not say what that is, but I believe season 4 is going to get Alias back, and fans are going to remember why we love it so much.  I think true Alias fans will like season 3, just to keep the Bristow's alive, others may want to stick with seasons 1 and 2-but remember, season 3 is just a teaser.

2005255,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias Season 2 was, in my opinion, the best season of television ever produced. Season 3 had sky high expectations to live up to, and unfortunately failed to do so.

The first few episodes of the third season of Alias are typical high standard Alias with only a few things detracting from it, emanating from the love triangle. Season 3 peaks in episode ten, 'Remnants'. After that, it only manages to regain quality for one episode near the end, 'Hourglass'.

What was wrong with it? Well I can't speak specifically because it would spoil things, but suffice it to say that the season was brought down by uninteresting new characters, dramatic unexpected changes to characters that do not work, the abuse of one of the most interesting ongoing plotlines on the show to create a rather contrived answer to the original mystery of the season, and a general feeling of confusion at the end.

Still it's better than a lot of television, most of the acting is great, it is still directed fantastically and shot like a dream, and there are some genuinely good moments littered amongst the 22 episodes.

For people who loved the first two seasons, this is essential viewing, if only to witness the continuing story, and creator JJ Abrams promises next year will remedy things.",1094083200,2,1269,4.780821917808219

However, I have to admit that I am one of the Alias fans who did not find this season appealing enough to stick around till the end.  I searched the Net for the season's plot in my enthusiasm, but the weekly series was just not at par.  True, the scenes are still great, the confrontations exciting, BUT there is something lacking.  With the absence of some great characters present in Season 2, Season 3 somehow lost a binding effect.  We can say that in the case of Season 3, each individual part is greater than the whole picture.

2005260,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Picking up where season 2 ended w/ Sydney learning that she had been missing for two years is how this season begins. Sydney believes Sloane had something to do w/ her missing years, but he said that the Rambaldi device had told him only one word: peace. Now he is one of the top informants to the CIA. Sydney tries to go back to her normal life, which she discovers as impossible, now that Francie has been killed, Will is in witness protection program, her mother is nowhere to be found except for on the internet, and her father is in jail for communicating to her mother via the internet. Over the next 11 episodes is the plotline of Sydney recovering her missing years while being pursued by a mean NSC man as well as a new person in her life-Vaughn's new wife, Lauren Reed. The two are at odds w/ each other for most of the season. When the truth of her missing years is revealed, Sydney is shocked of what it is (hint:it has to do w/ the prophecy from season 1) and who tells it to her (terry o quin ((i forgot what his characters name was)) ). At the ending of that episode an assassination changes the storyline for the remaining 11 eps. of season 3-get ready an overused plot brought back in the form of Lauren-a double agent whose actions in this season resemble Irina Derevko very much. This in turn gives Jack and Vaughn something to talk about. Many new revelations are revealed this season- including lots of rambaldi stuff, a aunt for sydney (probably to make up for lack of appearance on mommy's part) as well as a semi-plotholed sister for sydney (watch the show and see what i mean) this one doesn't end w/ a bang as seasons 1 and 2 did, but it leaves you waiting january. luckily this will keep everyone company until then (lol) While the writing isn't as strong as before this is still RECOMMENDED, BUT ONLY AFTER PURCHASING SEASONS 1/2!!!",1093824000,,1860,4.425655976676385

K Weld,

Perhaps you are unaware that Alias Season 3 actually aired on Television from the Fall 0f 2003 throught Spring 2004. These shows are going to be the primary content of the Season 3 DVD and could have POSSIBLY been seen by all of these reviewers.

2005263,1,B0001I55ZQ,"This season was a complete let down. I loved the first two seasons. They were always action packed! The third season took five or six episodes to get started then went downhill. I could not believe how many episodes I watched before I lost all expectations.

Sad.",1093305600,4,263,4.595744680851064
2005284,5,B0001I55ZQ,"OK, like 99% of all ALIAS fans, I will agree that Season Three is the weakest of the three to appear so far.  Having said that, it was still one of the most interesting shows on TV, and at no point was it anything less than riveting television.  Personally, I respect J. J. Abrams and the rest of the production staff for being willing to take some genuine risks with the show.  I'm sick of shows that merely crank out the same old product week after week and year after year (another season of LAW AND ORDER, anyone?).  I love the fact that Abrams and the others were willing to shake things up, push the edge, and take some risks.  OK, so a lot of them didn't pan out, but at least they tried.  Apart from ANGEL, of how many shows in the 2003-04 season could that be said?

Even Abrams admits that many things did not go well in Season Three.  Melissa George's (whom I previously had primarily known as the Jenny, the daughter of Terence Stamp's character in THE LIMEY:  the film memorably begins over a black screen with Stamp urging, ""Tell me!  Tell me about Jenny!"") character of Lauren is widely hated, primarily because she separates Sydney and Vaughan for an entire season.  More troubling to me was the loss of Lena Olin (apparently more because she was simply not interested, than because of money quibbles), which robbed the show of the single greatest addition of Season Two, as well as the complete loss of ""Sydney at home.""  Hopefully in Season Four we will get more moments with Sydney eating ice cream, watching TV, reading a novel, hanging with friends.  About the only scene all season like this was the great time when Sydney and Weiss sit in her apartment and empty a bottle of tequila doing shots.  We could have used a whole lot more of that (as well as more of Weiss as a friend--he would have helped make up for the incredible loss of Will in Season Three, though I've read that he is going to be back to some degree in Season Four, and hopefully not merely as a guest).

Still, a huge number of things went well in Season Three.  The missions were consistently exciting, most of them doing a marvelous job of advancing the plot.  Arvin Sloane managed to emerge as an even more complex and difficult to comprehend character, apparently having undergone a moral conversion of sorts.  For the greater part, the stunning reappearance of Sydney after having been missing for two years was masterfully handled, and occasioned some truly shocking moments.  And although I have never been much of a fan of the Reynaldo Rambaldi aspects of the show (which always seems to edge the show a bit away from being James Bond in a skirt and further towards INDIANA JONES or TOMB RAIDER), that theme does manage to generate many of the crucial plot turns and is well integrated into the rest of the story.  I'm not as enamored of the new bad guy outfit, The Covenant, but it does bring the ever evil Sark back into the story, and provides the occasion for a great appearance by the great African actor Djimon Hounsou as an especially ruthless bad guy.

Season Three also is probably more overtly critical of a presidential administration than any series in the history of American television.  Forget the Covenant; for the first half of the season the bad guys are members of the Bush administration.  Lindsey, a National Security Council director whose immediate boss (an obvious, if unstated, point) is Condleezza Rice and who is said to be a golf buddy of the president, embodies all the worst possibilities of abuse under the Patriot Act.  Lindsey gleefully ignores the writ of habeas corpus, and routinely tosses people into jail and throws away the key.  He also embodies the lack of accountability and openness that has reached an apex in this administration.  And given that the CIA has been almost openly at war with the Bush team, this fits even closer with the theme of the show.  The first half of the season, before Lindsey's assassination, mirrors Sydney's angry words to him in a men's bathroom:  ""Go ahead, give me an object lesson in the abuse of power.""  And so he does.

So yeah, it isn't as good as the first two seasons.  But ALIAS didn't rest on its laurels.  Everyone involved continued to push the envelope, did their best to go further, and despite the disappointments still managed a stunning season.  And with the stunning final moments of the season, with Sydney learning that Project Christmas was an active program (with her at its center), I'm am primed and ready for Season Four.",1093046400,39,4519,4.60875

2005287,4,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias is great and I'm eagerly awaiting Season Four in January but this season was a little disappointing compared to the fantastic second season and the exciting & new first season.

Why was it disappointing?  I know I've said that twice now and I'm not discouraging anyone who is thinking about buying the DVD from buying it, the show's still great and I recommend it but...if you don't have the first two seasons or haven't seen those...stop what you are doing right now, get those, watch them non-stop for the 32-33 hours it'll take to get through them and then come back here to read the rest of this.  Yeah, the first two years were THAT good.

The disappointments of Year Three:

1) Uh, sorry if you've heard this before...Lauren Reed (Melissa George).  I sorta see what they were trying to do here with the whole Vaughn as Jack Bristow, Lauren as Irina Derevko thing but sorry I don't want that storyline again.  Put Vaughn & Sydney back together again please and let them go to a damn hockey game for once!  Or at least bring back the Sydney/Vaughn hockey practice scenes.  Those are some of my favorites.

2) The whole disappearance of any kind of a life outside the agency for Sydney.  In the first two seasons she had Will & Francie (then the evil Francie but she was still there doing her duplicitious things) to do stuff with (and the Vaughn thing too).  She also had her school stuff in the first year to give us something different to look at.  In year three, it's all about CIA stuff and that's about it (with the brief Will interlude).  This isn't good.  I love the CIA stuff and I love Sydney the International Spy and I know the show is called Alias but give the girl a break please.  Let's see her eat ice cream again or go jogging with a friend.  Something.  Please.

3) The whole allusions to Irina Derevko without having her really around.  Not having Lena Olin available for this season really hurt it and I think it caused storyline problems.  I'm sure J.J. Abrams was counting on having Irina around for season three and he had to adjust on the fly when Lena Olin backed out because of money.  The whole Irina/Jack/Sydney dynamic is so spectacular and it is what made season two tremendous.

4) Let's see what else.  Umm, the whole is Sloane evil or not thing.  We know the guy is conflicted about his past with the Bristow clan but let's not be totally ambiguous about this.  He's a bad guy now.  He may have been good at some point when he was CIA with Jack before SD-6 formed or whatever and I'm dying to see what S.A.B. 47 is exactly about but...it was better when Sydney despised the man and he wasn't saving their lives or whatever.

I'll stop there because as I said I'm making this sound like I'm trashing the show.  I'm not.  I still love it, I'm going to buy this DVD and I'll be watching in Jan 2005 when it comes back.

 As has been said many times before, Season 3 was a huge letdown from the previous two (which are stunningly excellent). This decline can be traced back to the episode that aired after the Super Bowl in Season 2. When the creators used that epsiode (one of the most exciting in TV history) to ""restart"" the series so new viewers wouldn't have to learn all the backstory of SD-6 and so forth, it eroded and (in Season 3) eventually wiped out all the best elements of the show. The Rambaldi elements became incredulous. The twists, turns, and liaisons became arbitrary, forced, and repetitive. Worst of all, the crackling tension in the relationships has downshifted into sniping and griping. And Lena Olin is sorely missed.

 The fall of SD-6 and the end of Sydney Bristow's double life may be likened to the Scoobies of ""Buffy"" graduating high school. It may have been inevitable but things were never the same after.

 I love ""Alias"" and I still ask people to ty it out - both so my friends can enjoy it and so its ratings will improve! The feature film flavor still lingers, the actors are all engaging, the look and music are still cool, and Jennifer Garner is so sweet she should be illegal.

2005300,2,B0001I55ZQ,"I'd like to start by saying that I fell in love with Alias the first time I saw it (specifically, ""The Box - Part 1"") and that continued until the FIRST episode of season 3. I remember how I'd seen a preview to the new season that said something along the lines of ""forget everything you know about Alias""...I really do wish I had done that... There were so many things wrong with it, I don't know where to begin...but I'll try. I'm not venting frustration or anything (already have along with all my friends), this is just a WARNING to all Alias fans who have yet to see this season: Simply DON'T.

 1) First and most important, Alias became unimaginably unrealistic during this season (though mostly toward the end). For example, during the last episode the viewers are tricked into thinking Sydney is betraying the CIA, when it is really Lauren under a mask. Then, Lauren is ""captured"" later and she gets Sark to talk about the plan. Surprise! It's Sydney, also with a mask as well as a voice thingy to make her sound exactly like Lauren...it actually made me roll my eyes. Then, let's see...Lauren's mother being a traitor with her daughter was pretty bad (not saying ""terrible"", because at least it made me laugh for the entire break).

 2) What happened to Syd's mother!? I know she apparently refused to go back...but even getting a replacement would be SOOOO much better than just winging it like they did.

 3) Nothing is left, except for Syd's CIA life. The reason the first two seasons were so great was because she had to worry about her normal life, her life in SD-6, and her life with the CIA. Now it's boring as hell...no lies between friends and no worry when secrets are revealed. On top of that, all her friends in her (now non-existant) normal life are gone (I still haven't a clue why Will left...it just didn't make sense to me).

 4) Everything you thought you knew about the characters doesn't matter anymore. The thing that REALLY got to me what how when Lauren finally left Vaughn, though he had known for quite a while that she was a double agent, he went out to kill her. First, Vaughn would not do that (I'm sure every regular viewer would agree with me). Second, when he comes back and is badly injured, Syd (who warned him against going) heads after Lauren to kill her (?). Syd is not a bloodthirsty killer (in the first season the actually changed an entire scene to avoid making her kill the ""Snowman"". He falls on his knife, if you recall).

 Here's a conclusion: Alias season 3 was random and boring. Despite how this review may sound, I'm still a fan and hold high hopes about next season. Until then just read the summaries at ABC's Alias page, instead of stomaching this horror.",1091059200,6,2715,4.522448979591837
2005301,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Being an avid fan since the beginning, I can tell you that this show has more depth, more heart, and more fun than just about anything else I have EVER watched on televisions or at the movie theater for that matter.  If you are willing to invest the time, this show will pay off in spades!!! Everything in this show soars high above the standard, mind-numbing garbage that is passing for TV today.

I will admit that some of the plots, okay...a LOT of the plots are extreme but that is the POINT!!  A show like this is not trying to be a spy documentary.  Taken as entertainment, as is its intent, there is nothing better.

Unfortunately, there are so many ways for the every day Joe or Jane to find entertainment these days, as compared to even a few years ago, that some of the best examples of modern entertainment accomplishment can go unseen by many.  This is where Alias comes in!  Never have I so thoroughly enjoyed a series.  Never have I purchased a show on DVD (have first two seasons, anxious to add third).  Never have I rewatched episodes so much. Never have I successfully HOOKED so many people on a show I love!! To date, I have showed my first two seasons (on DVD) to over a dozen people.  Not one was immune to the joy this show brings.  Each has been watching the DVDs and is waiting to watch Season Three on DVD before watching Season Four live in January.  While this show is great fun for the casual viewer, the best return comes from watching religiousy.  In my mind, Alias is reason enough for the invention of the DVD format and TiVo so that all of us, no matter how busy, might have a way to fit this gem into our hectic lives.  If it were up to me, the powers that be would make you, the potential buyer, the same promise I made recently.  Specifically, two friends were reluctant to watch the first two episodes from Season One (all it takes to get hooked in my opinion) so I just bet them $50 they would like it. What happened you ask?  They are finishing Season Two now in preparation for Season Three.  With the next season of Alias not starting until January, there has never been a better time to get up to speed on the world of Sydney Bristow and Alias.  Trust me...you will NOT be disappointed!!",1090800000,3,2229,4.330120481927711
2005302,3,B0001I55ZQ,"This was most definately not the best season of the great show of Alias. But that won't stop me from at least renting this. Some of the episodes were actually good, like ""Hourglass"" and ""The Two"". Actually, the main reason I think this is maybe worth the money is the fan commentary on the latter. It should be very good, I am told.

 So, I am giving this more like 3 1/3 stars. This is a great show, but the love triangle of the third season is irritating to say the least. I will probably rent this first before deciding to purchase.",1090627200,7,535,4.235294117647059
2005303,5,B0001I55ZQ,Season 3 definitely wasn't as good as 1 or 2. That's not stopping me from buying the DVD set though. Season 3 did have its moments of mind-blowing episodes and awesome action. It also answered a lot of questions we had in the past seasons.  I am mostly looking forward to the extras on this DVD like the cast and fan commentary but most of all the classic blooper reel. I am a big fan of Alias and I will stick by it until the end bad plots or no. Hopefully season 4 will lack that and Lauren Reed.  The finale of Season 3 will definitely have me coming back next year for more. What can I say...I love the thought of Sydney and Vaughn. I can't wait for the release of this DVD.,1090540800,5,678,4.052238805970149
2005314,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Season 3 was great.  It really took off when Syd found out she was the chosen one.  When she found out out she had a sister and she was Sloane's daughter.  Or how about when she found out her father had something to do with her disapperance.  Season three kept you on your toes.  This will be added to my Alias collection.  The only thing I missed in season 3 was Will and Francie.  I hope they bring Will back in Season 4.  Season 1, 2 and 3 were awesome and I look forward to Season 4.",1090368000,3,487,3.948453608247423

2005316,5,B0001I55ZQ,"I started watching Alias since the pilot episode of the first season. Then later on I got excited over the show because its the best show on television right now (on sundays that is). Alias is my #1 favorite show to watch any time and any where. Now that I own the first two season on DVD, its great collecting the DVD to watch over and over. I am so addicted to this show, more than words can say... Also I buy the Alias magazines which comes out every two months. I love having Alias on DVD to watch at home. Its a priceless item for such a fan of Alias. Seasons 1 & 2 were great, and season 3 was full of twists and turns which was really a shocker to learn that Sydney Bristow (aka Jennifer Garner) has a half-sister whom dad is Arvin Sloane. And finally Syd & Vaughn back together in the last epiosde of the season.

 2 thumbs up for Alias! The most addicting show ever!!!",1089936000,,877,4.12280701754386
2005317,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Many rabid ALIAS fans like myself were extremely dissapointed with the Greek tragedy that has been Season 3. However, too many are quick to jump on the 'I hate Season 3!' bandwagon before really breaking it down.
The entire season was driven not by cliffhangers and plot twists, but by emotions and the tense relations between characters. From the first episode to the last, the driving force was Sydney's issues with Vaughn, Lauren, and at the very end, her father.
While we can still expect all the spy-jinks and costumes, as well as a morally ambigious Jack (and now Sloane! at least until the end of the season), the entire Alias universe was tossed upside down for Season 3. And while there are several plot holes and obvious screw-ups, that's to be expected in a show as detailed as this one.
This DVD set has not yet been released, so I cannot rate the special features. I can tell you that I am looking for more colorful commentary from cast, crew, and the 'ultimate fan'.",1089244800,9,980,4.605714285714286
2005318,5,B0001I55ZQ,"I first bumped into Alias on C4 (UK) during the pilot. It caught my eye but because of poor scheduling I soon forgot about it. I later caught up with it by mistake (again) on a more reasonable slot during the 1st season's cliffhanger! I quickly bought the dvd and since then I've chased it all over the various schedules and channels here in the UK. It hasn't made an impact but unsurpringly got a loyal fan base - waiting til midnight on a Sunday for an episode is serious dedication.
I was happy when a channel finally gave it the respect this show deserves. Why? Coz it's awesome. Even when I went to work tired on a Monday morning, I knew it was worth it. Season 3 has been excellent, something we've come to expect but it was still 'disappointing' becoz we are used to something more than excellent. Because of very high standards set, small mistakes in season 3 seemed enormous (Lauren calling Sark from inside the CIA, would Syd have done the same at SD6? No way, damn she even  used a 'bug killer' when talking to her own father!)
So what am I saying? Even though I haven't seen all the season 3 episodes yet, I will definitely buy the dvd when it becomes available. If you want intelligent drama, excuse the pun - the talent working for this thing is normally working for the big screen - go for Alias. Sure, I miss the intrigue, the delicate little hand or eye gestures that were surviving in this big world. The gestures were not supposed to be the big world themselves. Trying to simplify Alias was a bad idea, if I was in charge I would've complicated it more, say, by bringing Espinosa back as some rival to the Covenant, or something ...In other words, there is still enough punch left in this show to last a few years. I'll be there for the ride, even if it takes waiting for a midnight showing!!!!",1089158400,,1814,4.366863905325443

2005321,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias has produced some of the most enjoyable, interesting television in years.  Seasons 1 and 2 were action-packed, alias-filled and they kept you on the edge of your seat.  Season 3 met those expectations, but didn't do anything spectacular to go above and beyond it's preceding seasons.  That's where we were disappointed.
We came into Season 3 expecting the action, the aliases, the suspenseful missions.  But the fact of the matter is, Seasons 1 and 2 had the SD-6 situation to fall back on.  The Covenant, our current terrorist organization, is not as deceiving, as involved.  Sydney doesn't have the determination and motivation she previously had to take them down.  And we, the viewers, certainly don't have the motivation to sit and wait for her to find it.
Lauren's all-too-obvious reveal as a double agent for the Covenant DID improve the season.  Dramatically.  Except for one thing:  we, the viewers, refused to see the advantages of her reveal.  Between the 'cow-bashing' on the boards and the letters of complaint to JJ, you wouldn't know that there was anything ELSE going on in the season besides Lauren being evil.
The love triangle was overplayed, yes.  But after all the complaining from viewers, the tension between Syd/Vaughn, are we not happy with our resolution?  And for those who have become sick of Syd/Vaughn, were you sick of the first two seasons too?  Because if you think about it, everything leading up to Phase One was theirs, their tension, their struggle to hold back on their feelings.
So what exactly is it that we're all sick of?",1088553600,3,1569,4.893939393939394

I am not sure if i will be watching next season. it was a really good show. i would reccommend DVD 1 and 2 even though the ending to 2 is stupid. i guess if syd and vaughn are together i will be watching with you all.",1088380800,3,760,4.212328767123288
2005323,5,B0001I55ZQ,"First of all, this is one of my absolute favourite shows on TV right now. (The other being Gilmore Girls.) My feelings about this season started after the season two finale when we all learned that Vaughn was freakin' married, that idiot! I couldn't wait to see who he thought was better than Sydney. But, yeah, he thought Syd had been dead for three years, but still! He should've known there was at least some chance that she was still alive. ANYWAY, season three introduced us to Lauren, Vaughn's so-called ""wife"" or somebody who could also be described as a double-crossing beeyatch!! I knew there was something fishy about this character from the very beginning & when Sydney and FINALLY Michael found out she was a traitor, I screamed with joy. And when Sydney and Vaughn kissed in an episode after that Lauren revelation, I was so excited cuz they really need to be together. This was also the season where we found out Sydney had a half-sister. So much happened, I can't even remember it all, but I KNOW I enjoyed it very much! Basically, this was another great season of spy-related fun and drama. But, I'm still kinda confused about the season three finale. Whatever, I freakin' love this show and these actors!! Can't wait for season four to begin!",1088208000,4,1259,4.675675675675675
2005334,5,B0001I55ZQ,"When I was growing up there were three shows that I always sat down to watch: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dawson's Creek, and Popular.  But as you probablly know all three of those shows have been over for well over a year (atleast populars been over for a couple years).  So I was looking for another show to fill in the void, and the void was filled by the of the best looking, action packed, Plot Thickend, Spy Series I have ever seen: Alias.  I was first introduced to Alias via watching the pilot episode of the series.  I liked the series, but due to school and other things I never really got to watch it (and if you know the show you'll know that if you miss an episode, you might as well give up on the rest of the season).
But then about 9 months ago I purchased the first season DVD.  I watched that puppy in 6 days!!! (Thats a record for me, it usually takes like 2/3 weeks to finish of a TVSet).  And then I was hooked, but so I started to Tape the Third season of of ABC, while watching for Season two.
Now that I have seen all three seasons I can't wait for the Alias Marathon I have planned for September, because Alias is one of the greatest shows (next to Buffy), but if you don't believe me, this is what a review for the pilot said: ""is ""a spy-fi roller coaster of killer gadgets, double roundkicks, triple crosses, poignant confessionals, cliff-hangers, sliced-off fingers, conspiracies, outrageous outfits, exotic locales, flirtations, mythologies - and that's just before the first commercial break.""",1088208000,2,1521,4.453237410071942
2005335,4,B0001I55ZQ,"The problem with Alias now is that they made the first two seasons so goddam good that where do they do from there??
The writers chose to take the series to new levels of twists and Rambaldi mysteries, managing only just to pull it off.
The show begins with Sydney-two years later in Hong Kong, being told that she has been ""dead"" for the last two years. Vaughn has already moved on to her disgust-a topic I won't go into too deeply but really begins to drag by the end of the season, and Sydney now, for some reason, friendless. Sloane is now a good guy, and Jack in prison. The non-presence of Lena Olin shows deeply, and brining in Irina's sister was a lame move, that made it all seem a tad desperate, as did all the constant new Rambaldi artifacts that seemed to suddenly pop out of nowhere. Anyway I'm babbling, and nearly saying too much but basically the season deals with love triangles, betrayal(yawn) and the Rambaldi end game.
The writing begins to drag and the twists become ridiculous. The show needs to think of something new and quick, otherwise fans will begin to lose interest. Now it does sound like i didn't like the season, but this is untrue-I merely disliked it against the greatness of the first two series. I still give it 4 stars for still managing to be a great program, but this is definately nearer to 3 stars than 5.",1088121600,3,1346,4.431451612903226

Jennifer Garner makes the character of Sydney Bristow soo amazing and in season 3 she proved why she is truly one of the greatest actresses to grace TV and movies. i loved season 3 and Lauren was the best villian on it since Irina Derevko. i loved how she drove fans like me nuts because of the way she played Vaughn and kept him and Sydney apart. (...) she was one of my favorite character's on the show. i was a bit dissapointed that the season ended the way it did and i wanted a huge Sydney/evil Francie fight between Sydney and Lauren but that didn't really happen and the fight was just ok but good.

2005340,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Alias is ultimately the best and most intriguing show on television. I, myself have been an Alias fan from the minute it began in 2001. It has been for the past three years the only show i cannot live without.  Basically, i start preparing  for Alias at least 3 days before. This include an increase of giddines and excitement. No show has ever done that for me. It is the perfect blend of drama, suspense, (a little comedy) and romance.  Seasons 1 and 2 were the most riveting and amazing seasons of a television show ever. There were some problems with season 3 ..that somewhat disappointed me. And me being a hardcore alias nothing slips beneath my eye. NOTHING!!!However, seasoon 3 was still the best hour on television every week or (sometimes every 2 weeks )[thanks ABC ]
Some wrong things about Season 3:
1. In seasons 1 and 2, Sydney always had friends and a personal life (will and francie.) In season 3, her relationship with vaughn was no longer in existane and she didn't have her friends. Therefore, there really was a lack of relatable instances in season 3. I believe this definetely increased the chaos of the spy-world which made the show less believable and real. Hopefully, season 4 ..she'll make friends and have vaughn again.
2. Okay did anyone notice in season 3, the C.I.A workers were using different cellphones and my biggest pet peeve was that Sydney started calling Weiss-Eric and Vaughn---Michael..am i the only one this bothered.  First of all the whole calling people by there last names was always very intriguing and just something different.  I loved that!! hopefuly it comes back.
And all alias fans are pining the fact that we have to wait a looooong time for alias. I myself almost cried but realized that hopefully J.J Abrams(the genius) will be able to bring the show back to life and back to its old valor(which i know he can do)
I could stay here for days just talking about why alias is amazing and how good it is..however im going to go watch season 1 and 2 for the billionth time..",1087603200,7,2024,4.611111111111111
2005341,5,B0001I55ZQ,"First of all I can't even imagine how the ratings aren't high when a DVD that doesn't come out for another 3 months has 29 reviews!
To tell the truth I'm a new fan of Alias.  I had been a huge fan of FRIENDS for as long as I can remember, but since it was ending this year I needed a new show to fill the void!  ALIAS did just that!
I had caught some episodes of season 2 the previous year but started watching season 3 without any knowledge of what was going on!  Let me tell you DON'T ATTEMPT THAT!  I guess in a way me being lost for most of the third season made me a BIGGER fan!  I had to buy the 1st and 2nd seasons on DVD and read the books to figure out what was going on!
After doing all this I finally realized what was going on and let me tell you the 3rd season was AWESOME!  I agree that the 2nd season was THE BEST, but the 3rd was pretty good!
My only complaints for the 3rd season are:
1. What happened to Sydney's personal life?  One of my favorite things about the show was her attempt to have a semi-normal life!  Sydney hanging out with her friends and her boyfriend!  There was almost NONE of that in this season!
2. LAUREN REED!  I don't think i've ever despised someone so much!  I mean she made me throw things at the TV!  She was sooo annoying! It also drove me nuts that Vaughn was so stupid to believe her!  I mean I was yelling at him to OPEN HIS EYES! I usually am not the kind to hate people, but she could make ANYONE hate her!
3. I'm big fan SYDNEY & VAUGHN!  I was really upset when they weren't together!  I can only imagine that someone will come in the 4th season and split them up again!  I can't stand when shows do that!
4. The cliffhanger!  Everyone says that it wasn't as great as the previous two, and I agree!  But truthfully I like it better that way!  Especially since we have 8 months to wait from May to January 2005!
5. I could just die that Greg Grunberg (Weiss) won't be back for the 4th season!  It's even sadder to think that his small role in the 3rd season will be the way he leaves!  Marshall and Weiss (besides Sydney and Vaughn) are my favorites!  To have a comic relief from them is something that I love about ALIAS!  I can't imagine a full season without WIESS!
6. All the new characters!  Lauren was just...there are no words for her!  Katya was just a sad attempt to distract fans from the fact that Lena Olin (Irina) wasn't in this season! Not to mention Nadia (Mia Maestro)!  I mean I don't hate her but she's not a character I could see myself really liking!
In the end you should definitly buy this season!  The acting is SOOO GREAT!  After seeing Jennifer in 13 Going On 30 playing SUCH a different role, makes me think she's an even BETTER actress to play such opposites!  Her and Michael are so cute off screen and on!
Overall I thought it was an okay season!  I mean ALIAS is still the best show out there!  I'm going to buy it and give it 5 stars, just because it's...ALIAS(and Sydney and Vaughn got back together in the finale!)!",1087603200,8,3001,4.096054888507719
2005342,1,B0001I55ZQ,"I am a HUGE, I mean HUGE Alias fan. Atleast, I used to be.  My life pretty much revolved around this show, as sad as that may sound.  I bought the DVDs of seasons one and two the very day they came out. However, I will not be buying season 3.  This show has become so bad this season.
""Days of Our Spies"" might as well be the new title. The whole season revolved around the boring, lifeless Sydney/Vaughn/Lauren triangle. Sydney used to be the epitome of a strong woman, yet all she does this season is mope and cry about some stupid guy.  Basically, I was screaming at her to move on, pick herself up, and get back to being the strong Syd I knew and loved.
Vaughn's character was destroyed.  He seemed like an idiot, marrying some random evil woman just a few months after his very close girlfriend died.  I never really cared about the Vaughn/Sydney relationship, but this season showed that it was WAY better than what we got.
Lauren Reed.  The character that destroyed Alias.  Seriously, she made no sense.  First, the writers obviously intended for her to be ""good"".  Then, in the middle of the season, they randomly made her ""bad"".  It became quite obvious due to the eeevil eyeliner and eeeevil stares which were never present before. How dumb.  She had no real motivations, no air of mystery, nothing.  Maybe she would have worked slightly better if she had been played by a capable actress.  Melissa George, you suck. Get over it.
Sark was ruined. He was my favorite character, but he has become a boring, one dimensional, cartoonishly evil, sniveling little bitch.  How could someone like Lauren Reed trick him? Ugh.
Sloane became quite boring as well.  In the beginning of the season, he served as nothing more than an informant. Boring.  Still, his motivations aren't clear.
All of the characters we loved pushed aside, given basically nothing to do.  Dixon who?  Yeah, he used to be the best when he was in the field.  Now, he's nothing more than a shadow of his former self.  He seriously did nothing this season.  Jack was given about 5 minutes an episode, in place of more important characters, such as Lauren effing Reed.  Marshall and Weiss were hardly seen.
There are way too many plot holes and forgotten storylines htis season to forgive.  I'm trying to wipe this season from my memory, hopefully season 4 won't be such a disastor.
If you want to get into Alias, which you should because it used to be GENIOUS, go buy seasons 1 and 2.  Seriously, you will love it",1087603200,13,2484,4.553047404063205
2005353,5,B0001I55ZQ,"I'm one of those ""geeks"" who have yet to miss a first-run episode of Alias.  What can I say?  I actually LIKE having my intelligence, for a change, OVERestimated by a TV show.
Season 3 came in on the heels of one of the most jaw-dropping season finales of any TV series in recent memory.  Where had Syd (Jennifer Garner) been the past two years?  Vaughan (Michael Vartan), married?  Jack Bristow (Victor Garber), in JAIL?!  (The sight of the perpetually perfectly-shaven Jack Bristow wearing a beard was priceless, by the way!) Talk about starting a season with a bang!
And then things got a little iffy.  Lauren Reed (Melissa George) chewed up entirely too much scenery throughout the season.  Arvin Sloan's (Ron Rifkin's) character, the quintessence of badguyness the first two campaigns, was flattened.  The short-lived Syd-Weiss (Greg Grunberg) romance that went for like an episode or two early on, didn't work out, and Weiss ended up as almost a side character.  (And if Greg Grunberg takes a walk next season after that, I don't blame him.)  While we're on walkouts, Irina Darevko (Lena Olin) staying offscreen the whole season (after getting an EMMY NOMINATION?  Lena, what were you THINKING?) did not help the story.
A couple of pleasant surprises did offset that, however.  The under-utilized Dr. Barnett (Patricia Wettig) having a multi-episode run-in with Sloan was a good point.  Watching Vaughn totally lose it when he found out what his wife was up to was also good storytelling.  Mr. Sark (David Anders) did make a few refreshing appearances, although too many of them involved Lauren.  Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weissman) becoming a father was absolutely priceless.
Overall, though, Season 3 was a bit of a letdown from the stellar Season 2.  Something about the whole season just felt less ""there.""  It's still the best show on TV, no question, but I hope Season 4 packs more of a punch.
So when does January get here, again?",1087430400,6,1942,4.904907975460123
2005354,5,B0001I55ZQ,"I must agree with the majority here... Season 3 was definitely not as good as Season 2, however I do believe it was better than Season 1 as a whole. But who cares? Season 3 was still better than anything else on television!
The one thing I love about Alias is that every season is different and has a completely different story line than any other season. Season 1 was all about Sydney being a double agent, Season 2 was mainly about Sydney's family and Irina, and Season 3 was about the love triangle between Lauren, Michael, and Sydney. I also think that Season 3 was more about Rambaldi than the others but maybe that's just me. Rambaldi is the only constant story line in Alias.
Anyways, I found Season 3 to be excellent. A lot of people who have reviewed Season 3 have complained about the absence of Lena Olin. In my opinion, I believe that Melissa George's character, Lauren Reed, definitely made up for it. Lauren brought a lot of elements to the show. I've never been so mad at a character on a television show. Truthfully, I was actually disappointed that she died in the finale (or did she?... lol). But like I said, a good thing about Alias is its ability to end and create different characters every season.
Alias Season 3 has everything you could ever want... drama, suspense, action, romance, and comedy (Thanks to Marshall). Alias is by far the best show on television. And I believe that Season 3 is NOT a disappointment. I just don't know if I can wait 6 months for season 4!",1087344000,17,1493,4.472527472527473

First of all, a DVD that WON'T EVEN BE RELEASED for a month already has 79 reviews.  Why this sign of Alias' nerdly loyal fan base doesn't translate into ratings, I'll never know.  But, in a way, it makes the show even more special to us - our little secret.  I just thank God that ABC and Touchstone, which produces the show, are both owned by Disney, probably the reason it's still on the air.

Secondly, I am an unabashed and loyal Alias watcher, but J. J. Abrams and crew painted themselves into a corner by having an excellent Season 2; it was a hard act to follow, not helped by Lena Olin's unexpected departure.  So, no, this season just didn't generate quite the excitement for me that the first two seasons did.  And STILL, it's the best television around - the perfect blend of excitement, intrigue, camp, mystery, and emotional reality.  I agree with one of the other reviewers here:  I miss Sidney's personal life, and I missed it right away after a few episodes.  My hope is that this returns in Season 4, of course with a twist that only the Alias creators can come up with.  After seeing Ms. Garner in the movie ""13 Going On 30,"" I would like to see Sidney smile more.  The character deserves a little bit of happiness.  As for complaints of how hard it is to follow the story - GET OVER IT <grin>.  The complexity of the show is what we love about it.  I've watched every first-run episode on TV, then re-watched them on DVD, and I still don't know what's going on most of the time - and it doesn't take away my enjoyment one bit.  Don't dumb down Alias!

Thirdly:  To ABC - TREAT THIS SHOW WITH THE EXCITEMENT IT DESERVES!!  As much as I'm gonna be missing me some Alias until January 2005, I do think ABC is making a smart move by postponing it until then so that the season's momentum won't be interrupted by several hiatuses (hiati?).  But WHAT a PROPERTY ABC has on its hands.  Good Lord, this should be a top 10 show!

Fourth:  I think, in retrospect, Season 3 will be viewed as Season 6 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer was (and how apt another reviewer's comparison of Abrams to Joss Whedon) - not a fan favorite but a necessary dark period for the lead character.

And finally:  From one Charleston Mountaineer to another - Jennifer Garner, you simply rock.  You do West Virginia proud!  And do you have any idea what a gay male icon you have become - !?

BUY THIS DVD.  WATCH THIS SHOW.  OR BE SQUARE.

Addendum:  The above was written in June of 2004; now that the DVD is out, I have to bump up my rating to 4.5 stars.  Nothing could reach the heights of Season 2, but rewatching Season 3 makes me realize just how good of a season it was.  Yes, it was emotionally dark, as befits the two-year disappearance in Sydney's life, and yes I missed humor and joy - although there were flashes of humor, such as the interplay between Will & Sydney when he guest-starred.  But it was all true to Sydney's character and growth, and however fantastical and campy the show may get at times, it's always been emotionally grounded and true.  Jennifer Garner can find the emotional truth in the most outlandish of situations.

And I even liked Lauren Reed better this time!  Especially after she started putting on that red wig and having post-murder coitus with Sark - !

It's heartening to see the great out-of-the-gate ratings for J. J. Abrams' new show, Lost, but it leaves me a little resentful that Alias didn't achieve similar results.  ABC better promote the heck out of Alias during Lost's December episodes.",1086134400,12,3566,4.432973805855162
2005357,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Ahh..sigh...another great season...yes, I got concerned that the writers will tap out of the creative fountain of excellent story telling, but nope...still strong...which proves this has got to be the best series ever.  The season 4 finale just aired on TV and left me wanting more...I swear I could leave live just watching these episodes forever :-)  yeah..it is that good and I am sooo picky. If you have not seen or watched any of these, then give yourself a special treat...buy all the Alias sets. Truly worth a 100 star rating, not just the 5 allowed.",1085875200,,557,4.731958762886598
2005358,4,B0001I55ZQ,"The season starts off where season 2 left off with Sydney waking up in Asia and finds out from Vaughn that she was missing for 2 years. On top of that she notices a wedding ring on him. She was  assumed dead so he eventually moved on and married Lauren Reed who also works for the CIA.

  He still loves Sydney but he also loves his wife and doesn't want to hurt her. Anyway a lot goes down in this season. Sydney trys to find out where she was for 2 years. She also finds out that she has a sister . Sloane had an affair with her mom and her sister is Sloane's daughter. On top of things Lauren is really bad and is a spy for the covident. Jack realizes it first and tells Vaugn. Vaughn finds the idea crazy and doesn't believe it until he finds things of hers to convince him otherwise. Vaughn becomes obsessed with getting revenge on his wife especially after he's captured and tortured by her and Sark.

  Anyway this season is full of action and surprises and it's always un-predictible just like the other seasons. It does get goofy though and some things are hard to believe. I mean Sydney is a tough girl. It's out of character that she would erase her own memory to get rid of the pain of seeing Vaughn married. The show is the still the funnest on tv though even if this season wasn't the best. Lauren Reed was a great villain though and her scenes with Sark are probably the most entertaining scenes. Alias did get pretty weird in seaon 3 but season 4 so far has been as good season 1 and 2. Still I think this season is far from bad, just isn't as good.",1085270400,,1565,4.162251655629139
2005359,4,B0001I55ZQ,"The third season of Alias picks up right where the second left off with Sydney waking up in Asia two years after the events in season 2, with no memory of how or why she got there. When Sydney makes it safely into CIA custody, she learns that fellow CIA agent and boyfriend Michael Vaughn( Michael Vartan)thought Sydney was dead,and moved on to marry another woman named Lauren Reed(Melissa George), her father Jack Bristow( Victor Garber) is in prison, Dixon( Carl Lumbly) is now the director of the CIA office she worked for, and her greatest enemy Sloan ( Ron Rifkin)is now a changed man who is running one of the most respected charity organizations in the world. Sydney manages to get Jack released, only to discover through videotape evidence from Jack that Sydney murdered a man in cold blood during the mysterious two years of her life that she went missing. This would begin the chain reaction of events for the rest of season 3 which include Sydney finding out who took the two years from her life and what happened during that time, as well as fighting her feelings for Vaughn.
I have been a huge fan of Alias for the last three years, and I have never missed a single episode. The first season of Alias provided for an original, sexy, and fresh spy thriller that was packed full of great action and dialogue. The second season of Alias managed to somehow be even better, and had an outstanding cliffhanger that left fans of the show feeling anxious to find out what happens. Season 3 did have a lot of momentum going in. But with Vaughn being married to the unlikeable Lauren Reed, and Sloan offering no suspense as a changed man, season 3 could not seem to find the same rythm as the previous two seasons. However, after the initial speedbump in the beginning of the season, season 3 still manages to offer plenty of twists, action, suspense, great cliffhangers, and the sexy Jennifer Garner. Overall, fans of the show will still be satisfied for the most part. The only problem, is that the first two seasons set the bar so high, that season 3 could just not go any higher.
The DVD package itself still manages to live up to its predecessors however. The extras are first rate with commentary from cast and crew, deleted scenes, and two featurettes. However, the blooper reel is what I am looking forward to the most. The blooper reels in the last two sets have been hilarious, and I have no doubt that the one for season 3 will be just as good. With great DVD features and a good overall season, the season 3 DVD set is definately worth owning.
A solid 4 stars...",1084147200,8,2578,4.534334763948498
2005360,4,B0001I55ZQ,"The third season of Alias hasn't been quite as good as the first two.  The introduction of the character of Lauren Reed was interesting, adding another element of difficulty into Sydney's life for her to challenge - but enough is enough - Syd and Vaughan have to get back together!  The element of a sister, Nadja, close to the end of the season - has turned the focus of the show in a strange direction.  While it might be seen as the whole reason for the search of Rambaldi artifacts in the first two seasons, i'm interested to see how J.J. Abrams will pull the story into the fourth season, and turn it into a great stroyline, instead of ruin the series with predictability and ridiculous storylines.  However, this season of Alias was still better than almost all shows on TV right now, and unless Syd starts battling monsters from the underworld next season, this viewer will be tuning in.",1084060800,,894,4.56875
2005361,5,B0001I55ZQ,This season has been incredible.  With only a few episodes left im dieing to see what plays out.  I hope Sydney kicks the crap out of Lauren.  hehe.  Anyway Alias along with Angel (this is Angels last year) are the only good shows left on tv.  This dvd set is of highest priority on my list in september.,1081987200,,304,4.172413793103448
2005362,5,B0001I55ZQ,"Okay, does anyone remember back to the beginning of the season when sydney blew up the corvette with the flame gun in the hot red dress VROOM!! I love Jennifer Garner.
People say that season 3 did not live up to season 2...well when u have a great dynmic presence like Lena Olin that we got used to reduced to an instant message u are gonna suffer a little , and they are at least being creative keeping her there: her sister, the passenger, the rambaldi box....
Okay, lauren is annoying and a *itch but at least now we have a better reason to hate her aside from the fact that she stole Vaughn.  I also love the fact that she is the new Irina, sabotaging her dumb trusting CIA husband...can we say season 1 please....?
I think it is good that sometimes we have to go bad all the way to season 1 to understnad things, and what about ""Blowback"" where first we see from Sydney and Vaughn and then Lauren and Sark.
At least Sloane is still bad and did not do a total ""DR. Evil in Goldmember"" thing
I detest some people who have said that some characters are gone Allison (Francie's clone) has been back and will be back before the season is over and Will is funny and handsome as ever in wisconsin.  They even brought back McKenas Cole.  The only character never fully resolved is Lazerey (At first Syd said he was shot, and then just dead, are wefor sure here) and especially ANNA ESPINOSA.  Do you people even watch from week to week?  I'll give you that there were lose ends in the beginning and in the middine and still now because of the covenant and the 2 years, and sometimes the writers just kinda fly by the seats of their pants , but that is why we watch.
Merrin Dungey has been filming again and lets not for get the key between sydney in the white jumpsuit and in the black.
Also great guest stars like Isabella Rosillini and Ricky Gervais from ""The Office""
Just keep in mind that we went from family triangle to love triangle and don't forget that there is a little flinkman now.  Altho I do wish Syd would get with weiss, they are beach neighbors :)
The last 5 episodes are always the best, remember the last ep of season one where syd was almost exposed by dixon and they had to get sloane to say the certain words...just please hold out to see what the future will bring and then see if it really deserves only 1 or 2 stars",1081555200,11,2336,4.25
