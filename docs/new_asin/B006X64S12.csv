8506143,5,B006X64S12,"Really excellent collection of surreal films. If you're a fan of the man himself, then you won't be disappointed.",1525651200,,113,5.0
8506144,4,B006X64S12,"First off I'm going to note that, and this may have been the artist's intent, but one film which has narration appears to be out of sync with the imagery being shown? Maybe that's a purposeful element meant to be a metaphor or something, however.

Awesome collection of work from an interesting experimental artist! I've found that, for me, the best way to digest this almost four-and-a-half-hour set has been to just watch one or two at a time and consider them, vs trying to power through the entire thing in one sitting.",1519430400,,523,4.623655913978495
8506145,5,B006X64S12,"Hollis Frampton was a seer and a prophet well ahead of his time. I had the good luck to take some film-history courses with him, and it was a revelatory experience. I mean, how many people could have predicted in 1971 that silver-emulsion film was going to all but disappear, and that virtually all film and photography would one day be in digital form, via the computer? Frampton, who died in 1984 at the age of 48, foresaw it all, yet he did not live to see the digital revolution. His films are not entertaining! They are, rather, intellectually stimulating, very much so. Each one of the experimental films in this collection is different, because each one was truly an experiment, not a just a knee-jerl repetition of some commercial formula. That said, I'm not totally convinced that seeing these films on DVD is the way to go. To really understand appreciate them for what they are, you must see them as a traditional film projection. But for those who might never have the chance, at least this release gives you a hint of what HF was all about.",1396310400,3,1053,4.576719576719577
8506146,1,B006X64S12,"This has got to be one of the worst things I've ever watched.  These short films look like you got a child a video camera and told them to go nuts.  Some have sound some don't.  There is no kind of consistency at all.  No story is being told, you are just subjected to random images maybe, or random sounds maybe.  This collection is so terrible it wouldn't even been worth Mystery Science Theater 3000 to try to tackle.  If you are not familiar at all with the director or have some very good reason to buy this, stay away at all costs!",1373068800,4,537,4.165048543689321
8506147,4,B006X64S12,"Hollis Frampton's films are certainly not for everyone. In fact, Nostalgia and Zorns Lemma are the only ones I got any real ""enjoyment"" out of (make no mistake, I'm glad I saw everything). I would strongly encourage you to check out some of Frampton's work on Youtube before you buy this set.

The video quality on these films varies quite a bit. The earlier films look a bit rough, but Zorns Lemma, Nostalgia and The Magellan Cycle all look quite good. Criterion, I'm sure, has done the best they could with what they had.

Sound quality fairs the same. Many of these films lack a soundtrack, but when it's present, sound effects and dialogue come across well.

The extras are actually a fairly big draw to the set. Most of the films come with remarks by Hollis Frampton himself. He doesn't have the most engaging delivery, but his comments are interesting and provide some much needed insight into these films. A 20-minute interview with Frampton included, as well as a lecture by Frampton narrated by Michael Snow, and a collection of product labels designed by Frampton.

A terrific set, but not for the unconverted.",1345593600,6,1120,4.757731958762887
8506148,5,B006X64S12,"There seems to be two kinds of film buyers: those that have a good idea of what they like and can tell from synopses and reviews whether something will be for them, and those who like to cast their line out and see what they might find. For those latter kind, A Hollis Frampton Odyssey might be a disaster of rather comic proportions, but for the people who come to it with some idea of where they're going, they might find a wonderful surprise. Expect to be challenged to the utmost of your intellectual faculties. Frampton may even evince some kind of sadomasochistic verve in torturing his audience, but hey, no pain, no gain. Challenging, delightful, witty, confusing, hypnotic, beautiful are all adjectives that I think may apply. So now you know, the rest is up to you.",1340323200,8,775,4.6231884057971016
8506149,5,B006X64S12,"Many Criterion Collection fans have wondered when the company would release more anthology collections featuring avante-garde filmmakers.

We have seen the release of films by Stan Brakhage via two anthology volumes on Blu-ray but yet, fans have hoped to see an anthology or special release showcasing the work of Maya Deren, Kenneth Anger, Ernie Gehr, Andy Warhol, Marie Menken, Pat O'Neill and Hollis Frampton, to name a few.

With the support from those who enjoyed the ""Stan Brakhage Anthology"" release, Criterion Collection has chosen some of the best work of avante-garde filmmaker Hollis Frampton,  in order to help introduce Frampton's oeuvre to curious cineaste but also please a following who have wanted to see a more thorough collection of his hard-to-find films.

Hollis Frampton is one of the most unique and talented filmmakers, especially when you follow his career as a student at Harvard University and Western Reserve University who was looked at by his peers as a genius but at the same time, he was also the type that walked the beat of his own drum and while taking a lot of classes that he wanted to take, he never graduated.

But it's the third of learning of art that inspired Frampton.  From his friendship with painters Frank Stella, sculptor Carl Andre to developing a correspondence with modernist poet Ezra Pound, Frampton would take an interest in photography documenting Carl Andre's work.

And with his pursuit of creativity, Frampton would explore his ideas through filmmaking and showcasing his experimental use of film, audio and also digital art through the use of computers during that time of his life.

While creating a plethora of films, some to have been shown in museums and galleries, the film that he is best known for is his 1970 experimental film ""Zorns Lemma"" but like a painting, many have had their own take and perspective of Frampton's work.  He would later follow up with the Hapax Legomena films and many more that would follow, including what would have hoped to be his magnum opus, the Magellan films.

But unfortunately, Hollis Frampton's life was cut short at the age of 48 due to lung cancer and for many avante-garde and fans of Frampton's work, his ultimate project ""Magellan"" would never be completed.  Yet, Frampton still leaves behind a body of work that is celebrated to this day.

""A Hollis Frampton Odyssey"" features the following 24 films which were selected by film preservationist Bill Brand and Frampton scholars Bruce Jenkins and Michael Zryd, in consultation with Frampton's former partner, Marion Faller:

FILMS FROM MAGELLAN

Hollis Frampton began working on his ""Magellan"" movie back in 1972 and would continue to work on it until his death in 1984.

The goal for Frampton was to create a film that was 36-hours long and it would be shown for 369 days (369 because the first two days of the cycle overlaps the last two days of the preceding calendar year and the last two days of the cycle overlaps the first two days of the following calendar year, source: Brian Henderson - ""Propositions for the Exploration of Frampton's Magellan"", note: You will also see the figure of 371 days used.).  At the time of his death, Frampton had completed around 7-8 hours.

The schedule was planned around Ferdinand Magellan's annotated calendar and the film would feature 1,000 films, divided into 24 sections, some films would allow for a few minutes of screenings while longer works would be featured during equinoxes, solstices and other specialized dates.

The Birth of Magellan
The Birth of Magellan: Cadenza I (1977-1980 * 5 minutes, 41 seconds * Color * Mono)
Straits of Magellan
Pans 0-4 and 697-700 (1969-74 * 1-minute each * Color * Silent)
INGENIVM NOBIS IPSA PVELLA FECIT, Part I (1975 * 4 minutes, 48 seconds * Color * Silent)
Magellan: At the Gates of Death, Part I: The Red Gate 1, 0 (1976 * 5 minutes, 10 seconds * Color * Silent)
Winter Solstice (1974 * 32 minutes, 36 seconds * Color * Silent)
The Death of Magellan
Gloria! (1979 * 9 minutes, 36 seconds * Color * Mono)

JUDGMENT CALL:

""A Hollis Frampton Odyssey"" is a fascinating collection of works from the avant-garde filmmaker Hollis Frampton.  Intellectual, witty and creative, there was no doubt that there was no limit to the creativity of Frampton's work and perhaps the work on ""The Magellan Films"" would have been his magnum opus if he did not die from cancer.

But I do know that for years, there have been a group of Criterion Collection fans who absolutely adored the release of the ""By Brakhage Anthology"" and many have been clamoring for a release of may it be Maya Deren, Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger and Hollis Frampton, to name a few.

And fortunately, the Criterion Collection will be bringing out 24 of his films on Blu-ray and DVD titled ""A Hollis Frampton Odyssey"".

First, it's important to note that ""A Hollis Frampton Odyssey"" and its films are not as easily reviewable for the public because it's subjective.  What I find fascinating, it would be a disservice to say that these films are easily accessible especially those who are expecting films that they hope they can understand.

In fact, the beauty of Frampton's work is that even if you look online, everyone including those who research Frampton's work have their own perspective of what they think the film is about.  The good news is that there are ""remarks by Hollis Frampton"" giving insight to why he made the film.  But Frampton is not the type to tell people what the film is about, he can tell why and for what purpose but not how one should react to it.

Starting off with the ""Early Films"", ""Manual of Arms"" is a black and white, gritty silent film as we see images of Frampton's friends with various sources of lighting.  Then we see one smoking, one cutting his nails, one sitting down and fascinating editing of back-and-forth images, short images unlike Andy Warhol's ""Screen test"" which fixates the camera on an individual for minutes and letting the individual play with the camera with a variety of emotions.  With ""Manual of Arms"", it's frenetic, gritty and this style of editing would be a signature style for Frampton for his films.

""Process Red"" is a short three minute film which one can picture being shown via a loop at a museum or gallery.  Another silent film which goes from white images to red, but this time, instead of the back-and-forth imagery, it's a loop of moving images, sped up and then repeated.

For ""Maxwell's Demon"", the film is another three minute short which has audio but it features buzzing to go along with the colors and a man exercising.  According to Frampton, this film was to pay homage to James Clerk Maxwell, the Scottish physicist and mathematician.  While known for his work on electromagnetism, Maxwell was also involved in teh field of optics and the study of color vision.  In fact, the first color photograph was taken by Maxwell and for Frampton, as a photographer and filmmaker, his goal was to create a short film based on the imaginary and pure energy of James Clerk Maxwell.

In the film ""Surface Tension"", it's a three part film that deals with the passage of time (a sped up film of a man playing with a clock while a telephone is ringing), the passage through space (featuring a sped up tour of the city but audio featuring a man speaking in a foreign language) and the third part, a disregard of time and space featuring a goldfish caught in an aquarium as the beach tides roll in, and titling is seen on the clip.

For the short ""Carrots & Peas"", we see visual images of carrots and peas in this five minute short, while a voice is played backwards.  Where in ""Lemon"", we see an image of a lemon as light goes around it and then focuses on the background, turning the lemon to a silhouette.  Interesting commentary included as Robert Gardner and Hollis Frampton discuss the lemon, while Gardner goes into discussion if the film is mean to be a symbol of eroticism.  Is the lemon a breast and the end, a nipple?  Once again, the beauty of Hollis Frampton films is one's ability to have their own perspective and opinion.

Hollis Frampton's most recognized work ""Zorns Lema"" is a 1 hour film in which Frampton came up with the idea of what he was unable to capture on actual photo stills while showing people, he can go in different order and loop through film.  So, what we have is moving images combined with video stills of titles, brands, etc.  I will say that when I first watched this film long ago, my perspective was a counterculture film about America being eaten away by corporations.  Money that is often spent towards corporation branding or material things.  So, that was my perspective when I first watched this film back then.  But it turns out that the film was an ""open allusion"" to alphabetization and the encyclopedic tradition.

This leads us to ""Hapax Legomena"", where there are seven films, only three are presented.  According to Frampton, each film is interrelated but are detachable parts and my favorite shorts included on the Blu-ray and possibly the most accessible.

For ""nostalgia"" (the first film of ""Hapax Legomena), this film is a story about Hollis Framptons photos.  Narrated by artist Michael Snow, each photo has a story behind it, and while Snow is telling the story, we see the photos being burned.

The second film of ""Hapax Legomena"" is ""Poetic Justice"", a half hour film about a filmed script.  What we see on the table is a cactus, a cup of coffee and a script/screenplay and the pages changes.

The third film of ""Hapax Legomena"" featured is ""Critical Mass"" , this is a witty film made during the time that Hollis Frampton was teaching at the State University of New York, Buffalo.  He brought in two individuals who are great at improvisation and can be volatile in a story about a couple who live together, but the young man disappears for two days and returns.  What we get is a 25-minute argument but edited in a way that that each word is repeated and audio that plays in black and then we see video in which the video, similar to the audio is cut and replayed throughout the argument.

And the final films are ""The Films of Magellan"", possibly the most complex work of Hollis Frampton that was not completed.  Broken down to ""The Birth of Magellan"", ""Straits of Magellan"" and ""Death of Magellan"", this was part of the work that was done by Frampton, worked on since 1972 up to 1984, the year he died.

Footage that ranges from a flickering cloud, a watch swinging back and forth to images of a naked woman walking, stretching, fiery embers leaving and returning and many more visual images.  These were films designed to be shown via a cycle of films for 369 days (or 371 days) with differing lengths, each day.  While the film ends with ""Gloria!"", it was not supposed to be the final film but it was the latest film of the Magellan cycle to be completed.

But the film is not easy to be explained,  but for Frampton, the films were a study of the way humans perceive experiences, the relation of the mind and the ""metahistory of film"".

And with that being said, this leads me to the question that I have been asked, ""is `A Hollis Frampton Odyssey'"" worth buying?  And it's important to note that as a cineaste, I am intrigued and fascinated by avante garde works of filmmakers in various parts of the world.  I'm intrigued by the most abstract, complex, comprehensible and incomprehensible work, even if these films range from the 1890's to the present, I watch these films to observe of what was the intention of the filmmaker.  Granted, earlier works were done for the sake of experimenting with new technology but with Hollis Frampton, this is an intellectual that saw life much differently than the average person.

He made his films not following any traditional path but creating films of his own accord, but with purpose.

I often hear a joke about artistic, avante-garde films that if one would throw a splatter paint on the wall, avante-garde cinema fans will have an interpretation of it.  And that is how I enjoy Frampton's films, like a painting that I can sit and observe for many minutes at an art museum, ""A Hollis Frampton Odyssey"" is a release where one can sit and observe and come up with their own opinion.

And if Hollis Frampton was alive today and was able to continue his work, using today's technology, I often wonder what kind of work he would create.  Similar to Chris Marker, Frampton would later incorporate digital artwork in his films, but with today's Internet age, I wonder if he would be satisfied with the human experience through his film ""Magellan"" if completed.

I think of these things and once again, I'm rather fascinated by avante-garde films, may it be comprehensible, accessible, boring or fascinating, and yes...even incomprehensible and complex.  And by saying that, I know these type of films are not for everyone.

For Frampton's films, it's about illusionist complexity as a whole and Frampton even said, ""the trained eye and the trained mind will respond in the way that he indicates"".  Some may find these films redundant, didactic or effete, but others may find it complex, surreal and cerebral.  As a fan of avante-garde films, I was fascinated by its complexity and audaciousness.  These films are about how you interpret it on your own, through your own personal experience.

Overall, ""A Hollis Frampton Odyssey"" is a wonderful collection of the best of Hollis Frampton (not a release of his complete work), but it's a long awaited release that Frampton fans have wanted to see for a very long time.  Not only do you get 24 films but you also get a good number of include remarks by Frampton and fascinating special features as well.  On Blu-ray, as expected, various footage ranges in quality and for now, this Blu-ray release is the definitive version of Frampton's work in one collection.

For avante-garde and Hollis Frampton fans, ""A Hollis Frampton Odyssey"" is highly recommended!",1336176000,23,17871,4.83744652846331
8506150,5,B006X64S12,"I am glad that Criterion has assembled a Hollis Frampton anthology.  Over the last quarter century I have had only a few chances to see his movies.  Screenings of experimental cinema are scarce.  When I watched them, I found Frampton's movies difficult and in need of repeated viewing. It is good that they are accessible, and in the excellent condition that Criterion is known for.

The movies themselves challenge the viewer.  Frampton has some basic topics he likes to address: the material work of movies and moviemaking, forms of human experience and perception,  the promises and disappointments of arcane knowledge. He likes to push the audience past the point of comfortable viewing. It an approach to film making that is directly related to the approach of conceptual artists, and it has the same effects.  The experience of watching his movies, even short ones, can be confusing and stretch concentration past its limits.

There was a burst of creative film-making in New York beginning in the late 50s and running through the early 80s.  For two generations, artists like Bruce Connor and Michael Snow, Lou Reed and Andy Warhol, Beth B and Richard Kern made movies that refused to let the audience sit comfortably in a dark room watching familiar projected images.  Hollis Frampton is is one of the most important of those artists.  By assembling this small collection, Criterion has made it a little easier to understand this difficult but important film maker.",1335744000,17,1473,5.020576131687243
8506151,2,B006X64S12,"After much anticipation, I received this item two days ago and have made my way through most of the films it contains.  While it's not fair to compare two different artists, my previous experience with experimental film came through Criterion's ""By Brakhage,"" a collection of the films of Stan Brakhage.  Whereas Brakhage's films are often loaded with engaging visual material, Frampton's films, however lofty their intellectual conceits, are often far less visually stimulating.  The product description describes the work as ""thrilling"" and ""captivating.""  Almost without exception, this isn't true.  ""Carrots and Peas,"" for example, culminates with a five minute static shot of, well, carrots and peas, with a backwards vocal playing in the background.  ""Lemon"" is nothing but a single shot of a lemon being very subtly lit from different angles.  Interesting in concept, but watching it is a different matter.  There are highlights - ""Surface Tension"" features a hyper-speed walk through New York and an interesting shot of a goldfish, and the ""Magellan"" films are sporadically interesting.

I realize I open myself up to ridicule from genius film historians who will snort derisive laughter at my inability to ""get it,"" and who will gleefully explain why these films are the greatest things since the invention of the motion picture.  And that's fine.  This isn't for them - it's for the adventurous home viewer who is considering a purchase of ""Hollis Frampton.""  To each his own, but I can see this one gathering all sorts of cobwebs on my shelf for years to come.  If you took a shot on ""Brakhage"" and found yourself pleasantly surprised, you may still find ""Frampton"" dry as dust.  35 minutes into ""Zorns Lemma,"" you'll either be pleasantly hypnotized or itching to switch it off altogether.  It doesn't matter how brilliant a film is if it's not engaging or remotely entertaining.  My suggestion would be to check out as many of the films as you can on YouTube before making a purchase.",1335225600,37,1996,5.058103975535168
