2556567,2,B000FA577G,"Strangely danced.  Stiff without that wonderful Balanchine flair.  But then, NYCB doesn't have it anymore either.  Costumes are horrible.  The French make such beautiful things, why didn't they just make exact copies of the divine Karinska originals?!  If you want to see these great ballets danced they way they should be, don't waste your tme watching this DVD.  Go to the Dance Collection at the NY Public Library at Lincoln Center.  Maybe they will break their hearts and let you watch a tape of the great days of NYCB.",1162684800,7,523,4.808988764044944
2556568,4,B000FA577G,"I was in the audience the evening the performance was taped (there I am, in the view of the spectators applauding Rubies!).  There is not a great deal I can add to the erudite comments which already have been written, but I can add one or two personal observations.

First, the main reason I gave the dvd only 4 stars out of 5 is the weak performance of Clairemarie Osta in Emeralds.  She is the very antithesis of the Balanchine ideal: she is short, dare I say almost ""stocky"", with very little magic in her stage presence.  She is the weakest link among the ranks of the women Etoiles.  And secondly, both the decor and the costumes were distinctly sub-par compared with the Kirov's, whose performance I had seen just a couple of years before.

Back to Emeralds - the audience just didn't ""get"" it (despite a French composer).  There was much squirming and looking at wristwatches during the act.

On the other hand, Rubies electrified the audience.  Aurelie Dupont is a consistent crowd pleaser, and her fans were out in great number.  And how could one not be captivated by Diamonds, particularly by the Letestu/Bart pas de deux.  When he knelt to kiss her hand, there were audible gasps.

All in all, it was a wonderful, magical evening - even if for personal reasons I prefered the alternate cast, whose performance I had seen just the previous week.",1160870400,60,1356,4.627615062761507
2556569,5,B000FA577G,"Los Angeles Times dance critic Lewis Segal says that ""Jewels,"" George Balanchine's storyless three ballets-in-one, has become ""The Mt. Everest of 20th century ballet, the jewel in the crown, the work that major companies must conquer in order to define their mastery"" and has replaced ""Swan Lake"" as the "". . . enduring standard of excellence. . . .""  I think Mr. Segal is correct.  The prowess of the Paris Opera Ballet on this DVD shows that this is a dance company which performs at the highest levels of proficiency and authenticity; it has scaled Mt. Everest.

Other reviewers of this DVD have for the most part focused their criticisms on the solo dancers.  These reviewers praise the principals for their technical capabilities and how well they execute Mr. B's steps.  But Balanchine also demanded that the ensemble dancers exhibit a high level of classical technique and do the steps he intended.  The corps of the Paris Opera Ballet do justice to Balanchine's choreography.  When I go to see a ballet or when I view a recording of a ballet, I often watch the ensemble dancers more than the soloists.  The corps of this troupe is among the best.

In ""Emeralds,"" ten corps women do various steps that complement the dancing of the soloists.  For Balanchine, every dancer on stage is an integral, essential part of the dance.  The corps de ballet is not for him simply backdrop or scenery for the main event; it actively participates and performs moves that other choreographers only give to principal dancers.  The corps women spend a lot of time up on pointe:  the most common step is pas de bourree couru and they do it beautifully.  As for the principals, Laetitia Pujol is fluid in attack but is trifle too emotive. ""Don't act,"" Balanchine advised his dancers, ""just do the steps!""  Clairemarie Osta and Kader Belarbi do the steps all right, but they can't seem to walk on the beat of the music as they enter and exit in their ""Nocturne"" pas de deux.  Both soloists and corps do considerable off-pointe walking.  In one sequence the women and soloists move ""through the arches"" of the up-raised arms of the corps women.  A fast-paced pas de trois, rendered suavely and persuasively by Eleonora Abbegnato, Nolwenn Daniel, and Emmanuel Thibault,  provides a shift in mood and in choreography from the more relaxed and lyrical romanticism that dominates most of the ballet.

""Rubies"" is hot, quicksilver dancing  for soloists and ensemble alike.  Many balletomanes and critics suggest  that ""Rubies"" is representative of America.  The principal dancers themselves and ballet director Brigitte Lefevre allude to this, calling the ballet an ""American musical comedy"" with Broadway overtones.  Perhaps.  The music and choreography are not by native-born denizens of Tin-Pan Alley but by two classically trained Russian migrs.  Balanchine said he only tried to express Stravinsky's music.  Etoile Aurelie Dupont rightly points out that this ballet is still modern, forward-looking, and ""multifaceted.""  Balanchine liked to say that ballet is woman; but in ""Rubies,"" ballet is man and woman, separate and equal entities.  Soloist Alessio Carbone is not just a cavalier whose sole function is to support the ballerina and stand behind her inconspicuously. The woman in this ballet is not a princess who is put up on a pedestal to be admired by her consort.  ""Rubies"" showcases male bravura dancing and Carbone is equal to the task.  In this neoclassical abstraction, the speed and agility of the dancers are tested.  Scoring high marks is the most Balanchine-like principal,  Marie-Agnes Gillot.  She dances as the leader of the corps of eight women and four men and is never on stage alone except for a brief moment at the end of the second ensemble section.  As the corps prepares to strut off into the wings, she slides into an open leg position that immediately becomes a plie, does an arabesque-penchee, turns, does another arabesque-penchee, slides again into the split leg position with subsequent plie, followed by a third penche arabesque, turns again, and exits.  At times she and the ensemble execute the same steps simultaneously while on other occasions she and the corps do a type of contrapuntal dancing.  In this ballet we also get to see all of the female dancers' legs without the encumbrances of either romantic or classical tutus.  Gillot and Dupont have long shapely legs and they use them to great effect by executing high kicks(front and back), impressive extensions, and other complex moves.  Both have very beautiful ""singing legs.""  The tune they sing, though, is not an aria but an Ella Fitzgerald scat.

In ""Diamonds"" Balanchine honors Petipa and Ivanov, the renowned choreographers of the late 19th century Russian Imperial Theaters.  The corps women, used more extensively in ""Diamonds"" than in the other two ballets, demonstrate just how adroit, delicate, and artful their ensemble dancing is.  The first scherzo of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 3 (2nd movement) features an all female corps of twelve ensemble dancers plus two soloists.  These ""ballet blanc"" women, clad in white classical tutus are swan maidens:  they thrust out their chests, wave their arms, and nicely reel off some grands battements, emboite moves, and turns of various types.  They also do a good deal of walking and running.  Incidentally, Balanchine always considered walking and running legitimate ballet steps and not just transitions from one step to another.  Arlene Croce says that in ""Jewels,"" ""The choreography 's binding theme is walking . . . a theme that bridges the evening's three sections.""  In the second scherzo (Tchaikovsky's 4th movement), four demi-soloists do pique arabesque moves, pas de chat, chaine turns, and pique tours in addition to other steps too numerous to mention. I haven't counted the number of separate steps but it seems as if  ""Diamonds"" has more steps in it than most full-length 19th century narrative ballets.  The final movement (Tchaikovsky's 5th movement, a polonaise) looks a lot like the entrance and procession of the royal court and fairy-tale characters in ""Sleeping Beauty"" (danced to another Tchaikovsky polonaise).  Agnes Letestu, the female lead in ""Diamonds,"" confirms that there are many other references to ""Sleeping Beauty"" in this ballet.  The finale fills the stage with 32 corps dancers and two soloists.  In this emotionally charged dramatic ending, we see the women in classic rows with the men at the sides; they unite with their partners with kneeling, rising, promenading, and spinning galore.  The finale ends with rows of  men and women striking various poses in slow 3/4 time and then as the music speeds up to the original tempo, the dancers form an inverted V wedge in which the ensemble women are in a tendu pose while the men kneel beside them.  The soloists are centered in the V wedge holding the same pose as the corps as the music concludes.  Every time I see this majestic ending, I feel a joyous passion aroused by the interplay of great music and of beautiful bodies in motion.  Balanchine knew precisely the emotional effect that filling the stage with a large number of dancers would have on the audience.  Lincoln Kirstein said that it was ""one of the best examples of Balanchine's applause-machines.""

The Orchestra of the Opera national de Paris led by Paul Connelly gives us polished musical gems.  The Stravinsky piano concerto, ""Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra,"" is a sheer delight.  The pianist (Jean-Yves Sebillotte) and the woodwind players are noteworthy for the transparency of their playing and how deftly they articulate the nuances of Stravinsky's score.

A documentary of Balanchine and his style (""George Balanchine Forever"") by Reiner E. Moritz is included on the DVD.  It would be wise to view it before watching the ballet.  The female etoiles, ballet director Lefevre, longtime Balanchine assistant Barbara Horgan, TV director Pierre Cavassilas, and set/costume designer Christian Lacroix all provide valuable insight about Balanchine, his ""American"" style of classical dancing, and each ballet.  The dancers were coached on Balanchine technique by former principals of the New York City Ballet or had the opportunity to view recordings of these ballets.

Go out immediately and buy this emotion provoking recording.  Only sitting in the theater seeing a live performance of this jewel would be better.",1153785600,43,8411,5.093498904309715
2556570,5,B000FA577G,"I was prepared to write a long and glowing review of this DVD when I came onto this Amazon page and discovered the wonderful review already written by Ignacio Mart&iacute;nez-Ybor and realized I couldn't add very much to his definitive review. (I urge you to stop right now and scroll down to read it.) But I decided to add my unqualified praise for this DVD if only to assert that his very positive response is not just one man's opinion. Everything about the performances, the production, the videography and sound is smashing.

I would add a couple of details. Like Mart&iacute;nez-Ybor, my favorite section is 'Emeralds' set to music of Faur&eacute; (primarily from his 'Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande' suite, with a couple of additions) and the two solos near its beginning by Latitia Pujol and Clairmarie Osta are so elegant that I immediately repeated them. The costumes by Christian LaCroix are particularly beautiful. The American spirit of 'Rubies' is perky, jazzy and fun. Its musical accompaniment featuring Stravinsky's 'Capriccio' with piano soloist Jean-Yves  S&eacute;billote is excellent as well. In fact, the entire evening's musical underscoring by the Paris Op&eacute;ra Orchestra under Paul Connelly is superb.

'Diamonds', set to music from Tchaikovsky's Third Symphony takes us back to Tsarist Russia, but with a difference in that Balanchine makes homage to the choreography of Petipa but adds his own spicy reinterpretation of it. There is an old film of Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins dancing excerpts from the ballet -- the only films of any of these three ballets -- and it is a treasure, but this new film of a complete performance of the ballet is definitely worth having.

If you love Balanchine, you must own this DVD. It is that simple.

2556571,5,B000FA577G,"This is an excellent performance of Balanchine's last full-evening entertainement (Coppelia came later but it was a collaborative effort with Danilova and anchored in Saint-Leon).  ""Emeralds"", ""Rubies"", and ""Diamonds"", contrast stylistically with each other to provide a varied evening of dance, the common thread being perhaps a pervasive aura of elegance, luxury and beauty, but otherwise the pieces do not relate to each other. Indeed they have been performed as stand-alone items; I saw the Paris Opera Ballet in the '70's perform Rubies which they then called Capriccio, Stravinsky's title for the music.  It was a different generation of dancers.  It gives great pleasure to see some of the children of dancers active with the company then performing in the current DVD.

The ballet has never looked better. It seems to truly belong in a magnificent jewel box, and none better than the Palais Garnier.  The choreography seems to fit the company like a glove.  French technique traditionally has emphasized clarity of movement.  These long-limbed dancers (and they all seem long-limbed, male and female) delineate Balanchine's movements as a jewel cutter carves the facets of a stone. They are always musical: indeed they offer live demonstration of Balanchine's ideal to ""hear the steps and see the music.""

""Emeralds,"" the first item, set to music by Faure, is probably my personal favorite. The beautiful and French Violette Verdy on whom the role was created in 1967 was memorable in it. The piece seems tailor-made for these Paris dancers of today. Technically flawless, projecting the elegance and subtlety in Faure's music, one can only sit back and wonder at the great, understated beauty of the piece, the quietly eloquent performance by these dancers. This alone is worth the purchase price.

""Rubies"" is a spunky setting of Stravinsky's Cappriccio for Piano and Orchestra.  In my mind, no soloists have ever topped the originals: Patricia McBride and Edward Vilella.  Nonetheless, the French do it very well, perhaps more ""boulevard"" than ""vaudeville."" In fact, they can't swing and strut their hips in quite the way American dancers do, but this does not detract from their virtuoso performance: it gives it a different accent.

""Diamonds"" closes the evening with music from Tchaikovsky's Symphony #3.  Until this performance, I always felt it to be the least effective of the three.  Somehow it always evoked memories of Balanchine's own older and arguably more interesting ""Theme and Variations,"" and suffered by comparison. Furthermore, the ballerina role was engraved in my mind by Suzanne Farrell, how she would move, balance and tilt, the expression in her face, her arms, how her fingers would arch. Well, I experienced an epiphany. For the first time ever after many years of seeing ""Diamonds,""  I have truly appreciated the piece on its own terms and left past associations behind. It is a marvelous ballet, perfectly structured, with fascinating patterns and combinations, and certainly a festive way with which to close an evening. Agnes Letestu as the ballerina establishes the role as her own, imposing her line, her style, her vision on a part so vividly etched in the memory of many by somebody else. She is magnificent. Everything works for me in this version of ""Diamonds"" that just quite never had before, Farrell aside.

The production shines. The costumes by Christian Lacroix are elegant and support, not overwhelm, the dance as his designs at times do. The decor is minimalist and cool, suggesting the glitter of the stones, the brilliance of the dance.

There's a documentary which includes commentary by dancers and a rare appearance by Barbara Horgan who worked closely with Balanchine and whom Balanchine himself entrusted with the preservation of the integrity with which his choreographies are danced.

There are not many opportunities to see Jewels, one of Balanchine's later great creations. It's a big ballet, hard to dance, and in the rep of very few companies: to mind, in addition to Paris, only New York and Miami City Ballets perform it with some regularity. The excerpts in the ""Choreography by Balanchine"" DVD's consist of a truncated Emeralds and the pas-de-deux from Diamonds, danced by Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins; nothing from Rubies. To my knowledge there is no other DVD of the whole work other than this great performance by the Paris Opera Ballet.

By all accounts, Balanchine always loved Paris. One of his greatest masterpieces, Palais de Cristal (known in America as Symphony in C, to Bizet's score) was created for the Paris Opera Ballet in the immediate post-WWII period. The Paris Opera Ballet itself has always had very cooperative relations with New York City Ballet, not only through the work of Balanchine but Jerome Robbins as well. One has to rejoice at seeing love so warmly returned in such a splendid performance of Jewels.

This is a DVD to treasure.",1151193600,68,4935,5.1373283395755305
2556572,5,B000FA577G,"There are now two fine recent versions of this ballet to choose from. This one by the Paris Opera ballet and recorded in 2005 and the Mariinsky version recorded in 2006 although not released until 2011.

The ballet is a totally abstract creation by George Balanchine based on music by Faure, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky. The steps danced in both versions are identical of course and are equally well performed. Both stage settings focus on the colour of the three featured jewels, my preference being for the slightly more sumptuous sets at the Mariinsky theatre. The music is equally well performed and recorded by both teams and both offer finely detailed camera work giving a nice combination of close and panoramic views. The sound in both cases offers good quality surround sound or stereo.

Although this is an abstract creation as mentioned above, it is nevertheless very traditional as regards movements and dress. It best rewards repeat viewing as some people might find the lack of narrative and drama a little dull at first. The target is actually to illustrate grace and abstract beauty as appropriate to the perceived characteristics of emeralds, rubies and diamonds. The music moves from gentle Faure to spikier but accessible Stravinsky and concluding with typical Tchaikovsky but un-typically using the conclusion of his less well-known 3rd symphony.

So which to buy? In this case there is no clear winner in my view and choice could well be based simply on price. I personally would wish to own both as the choices of camera angles and use of close-up and panoramic views vary throughout, sometimes favouring the Paris production and sometimes the Russians.

Prospective purchasers would be safe with either version despite my very slight preference for the Mariinsky recording. As that is an entirely personal preference others could easily choose the other way round and for similar subjective reasons. In my opinion therefore, both are worth the full 5 stars and will give much satisfaction.",1343520000,3,2011,5.103343465045593
2556573,5,B000FA577G,"One of the wonders of film and DVD is the ability to conserve choreography. This is a classical Ballanchine work and it deserves such conservation.  The technique is highly demanding but you can see why dancers would shorten their careers to dance it. Absolutley beautiful AND well-filmed, focusing mostly on all the dancers on stage for the vast majority of the time or at least on the full body of the principals.  This work resists the temptation to go close up on the faces (missing the action of the body, an annoying trend in many other films of dance)and it does not over-use double exposures and inappropriate disolves.  Very well-done!",1329004800,3,644,4.836363636363636
2556574,5,B000FA577G,"Though I'm not what you would call a die-hard fan of Balanchine, I must say that this DVD is definitely worth owning.
Personally, I'd recommend the viewer to watch the hour-long documentary about the ballet before viewing the ballet itself. It provides a huge amount of insight to the ballet, from the points of view of the directress, dancers, and stagers. For those new to Jewels, there is a significant amount of information given about what each act represents, and how Balanchine's seemingly abstract movements are actually something of poetic genius.

In the French interpretation of this work, I have to say that they dance Emeralds (the act that represents the French school) with the highest and most unique French quality. The dancers in the first act are perfectly selected, and the corps de ballet here is stunning. Very notable dancers here are Nolwenn Daniel (in the 'Entr'acte', or pas de trios), and Clairemarie Osta (in 'Sicilienne', 'Nocturne', and 'La mort de Mlisande'), who perfected the Emeralds image with their own artistic takes on the choreography.
The most disappointing of the acts was Rubies, which is well-known for it's representation of the American school and style. Here, it is danced with much more restraint, much less daring, and much more balance. However, technically the dancers are still stunning, so the effect of Jewels isn't diminished greatly.
Finally, Diamonds, the act that represents the Russian school and style is danced with an artfulness and with extreme cleanliness, though at some points, a little dull.
Of the three acts, Paris Opra Ballet is stunning in the French style in Emeralds, while the other acts are danced cleanly and precisely, though without some of the flair intended by Balanchine.

Also, the costumes and sets for all three of the acts, while somewhat minimalistic (in the Balanchine style), are very beautiful. I recommend this DVD to any ballet collectors, it's an important, historic work of art danced by a fantastic company!",1326412800,2,2000,5.113149847094801
2556575,4,B000FA577G,"Balanchine had a particular fondness for the French, and an affinity for their sensibilities.  I believe he would have been very proud of this rendering of this blockbuster ballet hit of his.

""Diamonds"" would not be with its brilliancy were it not for the precision and musical unison of the corps de ballet.  What a breathtaking, resplendent sight they are.  During the interviews, Barbara Horgan commented on how both the POB and the  Maryinksky caused the large ensemble pieces in ""Diamonds"" to ""give it a new profile"".  I can't think of a better way to put it.  And of course, we have the grand and womanly Agnes Letestu plumbing the deepest depths of the ballerina role, and showing for all of us to see, what it really means to be a Ballerina Czarina Princess.

Laetitia Pujol in the Violette Verdy variation in ""Emeralds"" is a joy to watch from start to finish.  Her hands, her arms, her deliciously articulated feet evoking Violette Verdy's own poetic feet...Two thirds of the way through the variation, she steps upstage left with her upstage leg, does a small grand battement with her downstage leg,  fouettes into a half turn facing the way she came, then lunges backward with an ecstatic lift of her left arm and head.  A delicious, liquid and magical moment,  as if she's ""swooning"" at the pleasure of showing off her emerald rings; which she repeats in the next musical phrase.  Pujol states with some regret that Verdy herself could not be present to coach her.  One would never know it.  I find that I play this variation over and over again, without ever tiring of it.

I marked this DVD with four stars, only because the inconsistent video quality.  In fact the performance I taped on a VHS tape from a PBS TV telecast is far more tolerable to watch than this DVD.  Please don't let this deter you from buying this DVD.",1288310400,2,1838,4.637770897832818
2556576,5,B000FA577G,"Yes, one wants to replay this disc, time and time again, catching the interplay, the movement, that one missed previously. I have no basis for judging how the Paris Opera Ballet matches up against the Company which Balanchine founded, or any of the other Companies licensed to  perform this work. Furthermore, I write only as one of the uninformed audience for ballet; I watch this as I did Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, The Nicholas Brothers, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson and the rest who grew up in Vaudeville, Broadway shows and film, as I watched Balanchine productions on the stage of the New York State Theater when Lincoln Center was still glowing in the first phase of its life ( the first major renovation of the entirety is now in progress) almost half century ago, simply for the pleasure of seeing and  hearing the integration of physical movement with music. I have no technical expertise, no knowledge of the ""moves"", I am just sitting, listening and seeing, without any intellectualizing, as people did thousands of years ago, when they engaged in dance and music, naively, without sophistication, just feeling what was going on.
From that perspective, and only that perspective, I am quite comfortable with recommending these performances for the sheer pleasure of the moment. Most likely, as I do, you will feel the need to return to catch sequences, movements, interchanges, that did not make an individualized impression on your mind in first viewing. Buy or rent...and enjoy!

2556577,3,B000FA577G,"I bought this in order to have a video version of all three jewels. I agree that the NYC Ballet/Balanchine style is not really there, the physical wit, the tiny moments that hold a pose, the legwork coming from the hips. The main problem with the video--and perhaps not the actual performance--is the camera work and/or the TV I'm playing it on. Everyone looks somewhat more horizontal than they should; ensembles are not shown properly, and look confused--which was never the case with Balanchine; and as one reviewer noted, exits are not always shot. The orchestra sound as engineered is too lush--louder and bigger sometimes than the dancers can expand to in the VIDEO--it was probably proportionate in the Palais Garnier. I kept wanting to tell the camera man to do something else, please. The documentary portion does not tell us much.",1273708800,5,840,4.922535211267606

If only we could get more Balanchine on dvd especially the Stravinsky ballets. I'd love to see John Cranko's version of Jeu de Carte again, another funny witty Stravinsky piece.

The Paris Opera Ballet is a great company which consistently presents techincally flawless performances with grace, verve, and style. Special praise must be given to the production, the sets and costumes, and even the lighting. A BBC critic recently praised their orchestra, which is very fine indeed, giving full weight to the music. The choreography is by Mr. Dance himself, George Balanchine, who made hundreds of ballets, and this is his magnum opus, a special work of abstract dance based on the music of Faure, Stravinsky, and Tchiakovsky.  Each section represents a different jewel--emeralds, rubies, and diamonds--with corresponding color and music.  This production contains an interesting interview with some of the principle dancers and directors, explaining how this ballet was conceived and how the Paris company approaches it. Of course, subtitles in several languages are accessable. Sound and picture are faultless, too.

2556584,5,B000FA577G,"... it's almost as polarized as American bi-partisan politics.

I thought the entire presentation was excellent.  Some of the reviewers who complained of blurry movement might want to consider buying a better TV set.  Some of the big-screen LCD and plasma TVs do not have the on/off switching speed of CRT-based TVs, so they're going to get more ""mouse pointer trails"" than us low-tech guys with our antique Sony Trinitrons.  Furthermore, the larger the screen, the further an image has to travel on the screen while it is switching on and off from one frame to another, so you are more likely to see some of the ""gray area"" between on and off.  Given a certain production resolution of a DVD, all other things being equal, the larger the screen upon which viewed, the more noticeable the movement trails.  In general, larger screens will not yield the same perceived resolution and seamless movement as smaller screens.

One also has to keep in mind that DVDs and CDs do not have the same quality as film-based video and vinyl audio recordings.  Much is lost in the analog-digital compression and expansion.  The sound quality on many DVD movies is not as good as the VHS versions ... in fact, the sound track on many DVDs is extremely muffled.

When in doubt about the quality of a recording, or the quality and resolution of your TV, just move your hand in front of your face from one side to the other as fast as you can and see if you get seamless, unblurred reception.

2556586,5,B000FA577G,"This DVD of the Paris Opera Ballet's production of Balanchine's ""Jewels"" is excellent. This full length ballet (with no story!) is a display of gorgeous dancing and beautiful dancers. ""Jewels"" is one of my favorite ballets and this is one of the best productions that I have seen, and I have seen this ballet performed by 3 different ballet companies.

One of the highlights is that the costume design is new, but this might not be noticable for a first time viewer. A slight criticism would be the backdrops.....they are not terribly imaginative! My favorite sections are Emeralds (the green act) and Diamonds (the white act) although most people would say that their favorite is ""Rubies"" (the red act) and ""Rubies"" is performed the most by various ballet companies as a stand-alone ballet.

I recommend this DVD for all ballet lovers. However a beginner ballet-lover might miss the 'swans' and 'princesses' !!

The opening scenes of the magnificent lobby of the Paris Opera House is enough to make one jump on a plane and be there in person.",1178928000,7,1043,4.848314606741573
2556587,5,B000FA577G,"I am very happy with this DVD -- the quality in terms of camera work, the sound (I have 5.1), and just how beautifully the menu is set up, is amazing. This is one of my favorite ballets of all times, and it's great to watch it when I want to :)",1176681600,3,244,3.7115384615384617
2556588,1,B000FA577G,"I watched it on big screens (57 and 106 inches) and whenever there is fast movement or the camera moves, the dancers are not sharp. I even wrote OpusArte about it, but was informed they don't see any problems with it.

The performance itself is outstanding, but the DVD is visually poorly produced.",1172707200,11,298,4.622641509433962
2556589,2,B000FA577G,"I have to agree that the DVD is not of very good quality. Movement is indeed blurred. This is, in fact, the only ballet disk which I have where I have noticed this to such an extent.  ABT telecasts of such ballets as Swan Lake or Le Corsair on DVD are much superior in terms of the quality of the disk.  I found it coninually interfered with my enjoyment of the dance.  One other complaint-- sometimes exits are as exciting as anything else in the dance.  No one who ever saw Edward Villella will ever forget his whirling off the stage after the 'playing tag' section of Rubies.  On this DVD, the camera cuts away before the dancer's exit!",1170115200,17,639,4.336134453781512
2556590,5,B000FA577G,"The Paris Opera Ballet performs Balanchine's masterpiece beautifully on this well-produced DVD. I can't imagine any other company today, with the possible exception of San Francisco Ballet, giving a performance as spirited, technically brilliant, and authentic to the choreographer's style and intent as this one (forget about the Peter Martins City Ballet, known in better, Balanchine-directed times as New York City Ballet). This disk is definitely a worthwhile purchase for lovers of ballet and Balanchine.",1168560000,7,509,5.8
2556591,5,B000FA577G,"I am a Balanchine dancer and guard his work jealously.  Though I never performed ""Jewels"" I've known it since it's premier.  Memories of those glorious performances have never left my mind and are the foundation upon which I base any comparison of productions of ""Jewels"" mounted on other companies.  It is now becoming a bit fadish for companies to have all or part of the work, it seems like everyone is doing it.  Some quite good, some not so.  Companies trained in Balanchine technique have the burdon of comparison with New York City Ballet.  However, other companies such as the Kirov or Paris Opera Ballet, legendary companies of classical technique, could find themselves in over their heads.  They simply have not been trained as Balanchine dancers.  That could prove disasterous, however, both companies have taken Balanchine to heart and, as a result, have blossomed into something totally new.  Mr. B. would be proud.  The Paris Opera production is a glorious example.  From Emeralds, to Rubies, to Diamonds, each movement flawlessly performed, immaculately coached, musical beyond description, and a total feast for any jaded eye.  The de la Croix designs (costumes) are perfect: new ideas based on the original Karinska's.  The scenic designs are two out of three: Emeralds and Diamonds are divine: Rubies not so much.  The lone red banner hanging upstage center is nothing more than a distraction from the precision, humor, and energy of the choreography.  It would have been better just on a barren stage.  Other than that, though, a sumptuous production that has been very intelligently video'ed.  At last, a full video of ""Jewels.""  What a pity the original NYCB production was not preserved in like manner.",1167782400,13,1725,5.07829181494662

8119553,5,B000FA577G,"From a Blu Ray technical point of view I cannot comment. But on an artistic level this is exceptional.

Whether you go for the Opera de Paris (filmed at the celebrated Garnier Opera House, where I saw this production) or another version - the Bolshoi has one out as well as well as the New York Ballet - will come down to taste. But if you are in the market for classy traditional dancing - graceful but with great contrasts of quirky funny choreography especially in the Stravinsky Ruby selection - with some wonderful solos, duets, corps de ballet and more...it's all here. And you do not have the distraction of a childish story line to follow which I abhor and puts me off classical dance from the start. Go for it.

The film faithfully replicates the theatrical experience I so much enjoyed in the City of Light and imparted a cultural ""high"" to my stay in Paris. There are good long shots taking in the action across the (largest in the world?) Garnier stage, medium and close ups which vary the visuals.

To my mind, this is a fitting tribute to Balanchine executed with rare taste and talent at the home of classical dance. A real delight for experts, afficionados - or kids fresh off the block like me! Get it.",1437091200,,1219,4.481981981981982

This is a different sort of ballet from what I'd been coerced into watching before.
No money wasted on sets or contrived stories.  No obligatory cameo dances by the director's niece and friends, This is purely ballet at it's best.  Danced by the Paris Opera Ballet Company, it reaches heights of excellence seldom seen anywhere.  Magnificent choreography and the most amazing performances by everyone involved.  There is humor, drama, and grace and when it was over, I wanted more.",1436227200,,610,4.9411764705882355

8119558,5,B000FA577G,"This electrifying ballet by the eminent George Balanchine is an abstract triptych, performed to compositions by, respectively,  Faur&eacute;, Stravinsky, and Tchaikovsky, with the ever intriguing choreographer's recognizable use of stage techniques permitting the emphasis of the work to be upon the matchless dancing by members from the Paris Opera Ballet, even upon consideration of designer Christian LaCroix' essay into the medium of classical ballet costuming.  Balanchine's inspiration for Joyaux, presented here upon the stage of the delightfully ornamental Palais Garnier in Paris, before a live audience, came from showcase windows of the celebrated Manhattan jewelers, Van Cleef and Arpels, from which originated the disparate gem-based imagery created for the affair: emeralds, rubies, and diamonds.  The persona of Balanchine seems to be immediate throughout.  The French company is one of but six that include Joyaux within their repertories, and this performance makes it clear that the Paris Opera Ballet shall provide a touchstone for Balanchine's dazzling invention for a good many years later than this 2005 production that features a magnificent corps, and the tightly trained Orchestre national de l'Opera de Paris beneath the skillful baton of Paul Connelly.  Etoiles and other soloists from the French company sparkle as might the jewels that they depict during this ambitiously staged masterpiece that additionally benefits from the designing of Christian Lacroix that gives the ballet the character of being a brand new creation, despite its public debut in 1967 when performed by Balanchine's New York City Ballet.  An Opus Arte DVD is currently the sole video source for Joyaux.  It includes a fine documentary:  ""George Balantine Forever"", that features interviews of several Paris Opera Ballet &eacute;toiles, and other soloists.  These are supplied with optional subtitles.  The entire DVD, one that provides excellent visual and sound quality, runs for greater than one and one-half hours, during which it effectively presents a superior ballet creation, one that should become a requisite inclusion for any viewer's dance collection on film as it showcases a great deal of matchless balletic execution.",1363996800,,2233,5.658682634730539
