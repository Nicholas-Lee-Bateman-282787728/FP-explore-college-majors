7969125,1,B00006IFSG,"Watching this movie was about as fun as a homework assignment.  While it was just about as cheesy as a cheesy martial arts flick can get (and that's good news for some folks), it's just about pure rotten cheese.  Everything, and I mean everything is just awful in this film.  There is a ton of fight action, and that shouldn't be bad, but it is totally screwed up as well.

There are basically two stories within the film, yet neither have any connection to the other, which I was hoping would at least happen at the end.  The first is about two white guys who train to fight each other in a private ring to be the best.  The other, which is a little more interesting and gets more focus, is about Thai gangs and cops, who is corrupt and who isn't, and features a showdown between a loyal cop and an outlawed streetfighter.  There are so many fights with Pete (the streetfighter) and Thai gangs that it becomes hard to keep up with.  I think it was all thrown together to provide a lot of kung fu action.  The action could have been really good, in that classic kung fu way, but the directing and editing absolutely ruins it, and the slow motion echo hit sound effects become old after the first dozen times.

The film is dubbed and there is no subtitle option.  If you thought the dubbing in a Jackie Chan movie was bad, then you haven't seen anything yet.  It becomes a comedy in Kickboxer King.  The dialouge and script are just about as bad, and even the music is either really cheesy or really overdramatic.  The funniest thing is when the film ended, one guy says ""You did it, you won!"" and then its right back to the main menu, no ending credits or music.

If there is anything, anything at all that redeems this is that some of the Thai fighters are really good, and have some excellent skills, but the director ruins it completely.  This is about as cheesy as it gets, so if you're all for it, go for it, or you just might be laughing so hard it hurts.",1192665600,6,1961,4.288043478260869
