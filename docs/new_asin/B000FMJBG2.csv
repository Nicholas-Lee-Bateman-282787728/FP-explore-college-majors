8124677,3,B000FMJBG2,"Charming 80's teen comedy fluff, THE PRINCESS ACADEMY isn't as well remembered as ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Weird Science"", but still enjoyable when taken in the right spirit.

Lar Park Lincoln stars as Cindy Cathcart, a young reform school girl from America, who wins a scholarship to the Von Pupsin Academy in Switzerland.  It's THE place for pampered, poor little rich girls, where they learn all about the in's and out's of credit cards, caviar and careers...as women under the men who rule, of course.  Countess Von Pupsin (Eva Gabor) is their charming headmistress, but she's being slowly undermined by corrupt matron Fraulein Stinkenschmidt (Lu Leonard).

The rest of the film focuses on Cindy and her high society schoolmates as they mix and mingle with students from a neighbouring boys' college, arrange a rendezvous for two love-starved nerds in, of all places, a whorehouse; and of course save the day for the Countess.

Most of the actresses do manage to convince us of being teenagers (though precious few of them actually were at the time of filming).  80's sexpot Carole Davis is especially campy here.  Despite her star billing, Eva Gabor has surprisingly very little screen time and her performance seems like it has been telephoned in from an altogether different movie!  She spends most of her scenes draped over the arm of an elderly admirer in ""I Remember It Well"" mode, albeit gorgeously costumed in true 80's flair by Nolan Miller.  THE PRINCESS ACADEMY was filmed on location in Yugoslavia, and does have some fantastic photography.  The soundtrack features Sid Caesar's outragous ""Gold Card Rap""...yes, you read that correctly.

Super fun if you're lucky enough to track it down.",1149552000,,1701,5.060931899641577
