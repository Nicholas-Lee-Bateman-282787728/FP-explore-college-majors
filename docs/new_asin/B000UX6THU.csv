2925972,5,B000UX6THU,"I wish we could get such a ""Unique"" show on our own TV networks over here in Europe but...we don't. You lucky B.

Having followed Stephen since his appearances in Jon Stewart's Daily Show a few years ago, it was with such a great pleasure that I joined the crowds of dedicated fans (some gathered in The Colbert Nation) when He got his very own show.

There's Nothing like it on TV anywhere, indeed !!!  From the Threatdown to The Word, the entire show is just Brilliant!  Smart, clever, thoughtful and packed with such ""Humour Noir"" & sarcasm that only one word comes to my mind :  Respect !!!",1190764800,6,594,4.412844036697248

2925986,3,B000UX6THU,"Honestly, I was hoping this would be a lot funnier. It's selections from the beginning of when his show started so it' not as fine tuned.

2925991,3,B000UX6THU,"I have enjoyed watching Colbert ever since his Daily Show days with 'This Week in God'. He is extremely talented and has a great writing staff. His segments are legendary and have become the stuff of Wikipedia and even dictionaries (via gluestick, at least).

The first hour of this ""Best of"" is hilarious. We are treated to multiple segments of 'The Word' and 'Better Know a District'; District of Columbia's Representative put up quite a fight, even though she came off as both racist and nationist.

However, this DVD became tiring after the first hour; 'Shock and Awe' was a unique segment, but the 22 minutes devoted to it could have been reduced. I soon left the DVD running while I performed other tasks, listening to it instead. My attention-span was no match for the three hours this DVD requires.",1264723200,,806,4.75
2925992,5,B000UX6THU,I laughed all the way through. I love Stephen Colbert and this was a great collecton of all my favorite moments from his show! I hope that Stephen will come out with another. If you're a fan of his show... then you will love The Best of the Colbert Report.,1231286400,3,256,4.14

The menu is basic scroll of clips and thats about it, well previews of other Comedy Central releases. Its not really the best of the show. Poor selection of clips, whoever picked them. The only saving grace for the dvd is the Better Know a District segements, which is one of the funniest segements in any variety/news show. Still I recommend it to Colbert fans because they love him no matter what.",1201219200,10,552,4.3173076923076925

2925997,5,B000UX6THU,"By saved my life I mean filled me with the American spirit, of course.

What this DVD is, in a nutshell, is Comedy Central compiling all of the clips that we'd probably look for on youtube to show our friends. This is a collection of the times that Stephen has not just reported on the news, but created it.

~The Star Wars Green Screen Challenge! (not a contest)
~His shred down with The Decemberists

It's hilarious. We giggled for hours. Seriously, this DVD was long! I was extremely pleased and will be sharing this with my friends for sure. =) A+ for Stephen!",1199836800,2,621,4.627272727272727
2925998,2,B000UX6THU,Wow what a let down - i never laughed so little at Colbert material.  I suppose every great comedian reaches sellout at a specific point of success.

2925999,5,B000UX6THU,"The box of chocolates was nice and perfume wasn't a bad thing....but to make my Christmas sweeter,
I ordered myself The Best of The Colbert Report well before Christmas.  Imagine my surprise and delight when I opened the DVD which had been placed under my tree by Santa. I've only watched half of it because of time constraints but it's as good as I thought it would be. Stephen is
witty, charming, a great interviewer. He knows all just like Papa Bear and his little buddy ""W"". I'm hoping Jane Fonda is on it. She makes more trouble on his lap than she did on the tank!",1199059200,,570,4.327102803738318
2926000,4,B000UX6THU,"This is a long and meaty collection of what someone somewhere deemed the best of the Report.  Too bad they didn't ask me for help, they'd have ended up with a much better collection.

Its still great though.  We've missed a lot of the Report, so we were able to catch up on the highlights of some of what we had missed, and see again some of our favorite bits.

A good gift, but hardly definitive, collection.",1198368000,,409,4.2727272727272725

Purchase this book for each member of your family, you will not be sorry.  Hopefully you will be able to get in on one of the First Editions...destined no doubt to be a collector's item.

2926002,5,B000UX6THU,"The man who is America (and so can you, by the way), cannot run for President in his home state of South Carolina. Stephen Colbert, my horse for the long haul 2008 Presidential election--the man who promised--if elected--that he would ""crush the state of Georgia"" because their peaches weren't as good--is not going to be the Democratic nominee from S.C. The reasoning behind the Democratic executive committee, which makes the ultimate decision who can run as a Democrat, was that Colbert wasn't a serious candidate. ""I think this committee that votes took their responsibilities seriously. Our rules are pretty specific about what makes a legitimate candidate,"" a committee member said. Well, excuse me, Miss Committee member! If thousands and thousand of South Caolinigian legal and illegal immigrants want to vote for a joke, what's wrong with that? Remember all the people who voted for Ross Perot? What a joke. I see nothing different from John Edwards' comments about health care and Colbert's comments about peaches. They're both jokes--only Colbert is up front about his comedy (well, kind of).

2926004,5,B000UX6THU,"...thankfully I tuned in to the Colbert Report: a brilliantly humorous show and guaranteed Stress-Reliever >regardless of one's own political affiliation. Colbert is for Everyone -and that's a great rarity! For the devout fan: most of the best goodies are on this great collection, but not all. This just left me wanting to see more. -good marketing strategy. Funny stuff!

2926005,1,B000UX6THU,"When I first noticed that this DVD set called the ""Best of the Colbert Report"" was being released,  I was ecstatic.  I figured I'd get around 20-25 dvd's containing every episode ever recorded and then some and for only $14.99 ... who could beat that price.
But No!!!  This is only a small glimpse into the first few season of the show.  Mr. Colbert,  this is not a ""Best of"",  what you gave us is called a ""greatest hits"" compilation.
The best of your show should begin with the opening sequence of your first ever show  and lasting up to the present day and into the future.  Yes Stephen,  with the purchase of this DVD I was expecting future DVD's to be sent to my house weekly for the remainder of the relevancy of your show,  just so my ""Best of"" set would be constantly up to date and be truly what you so falsely described it.
I don't even know what to do with this purchase.  It's like giving a Coke sniffin junkie some over-the-counter nose spray instead of what he most needed (and deserved).  You're just lucky the Hollywood writers are on strike because I was planning on boycotting your show for a week....so there.(Good thing too, cause it would've killed me to miss even a single episode of your show)",1194912000,4,1216,4.403587443946188
2926006,5,B000UX6THU,"I've finally seen this DVD and I have to say that I spent the whole three hours laughing (not continuously, but close!).  It was a wonderful peek into the world of Stephen Colbert and the awesome 'Colbert Report' and all the goings on in this man's head.  I am a relatively new fan of Colbert and his show, so this look back on the Repor(t) from about early '07 and before to the very first episode was an incredible delight.  I could probably go on and on about how much I liked it, but to make it short: The Best of The Colbert Report deserves a hearty Tip of the Hat and I recommend it to anyone who finds Papa Bear O'Rilley scary/a father figure and also loves making the best dessert in America; among other things; this DVD is for you! Awesome man (handsome too :) and a great show!  Colbert '12!",1194652800,2,802,4.222222222222222

2926008,3,B000UX6THU,"If you're a dedicated viewer of the Report, you might find yourself a bit disappointed with this DVD.  While it does feature some of the major highlights of the past couple years, there is so much missing: no gag reel, no behind-the-scenes, no sign of segments like Tip of the Hat, Who's Honoring Me Now, Alpha Dog of the Week, Cheating Death, Bears and Balls, the Atone Phone, etc.  The disc features only one Threatdown and two Words.  The Report is a big show packed with hilarity, and often it's the little things (character breaks, malfunctions, random absurdity) that truly make it great.  Comedy Central would do well in the future to include some montages that capture more of TCR's daily wit instead of presenting only the biggest events as an uninspired overview.",1194393600,48,773,4.7894736842105265
2926009,1,B000UX6THU,"I have to agree with those who have reviewed this DVD now it has been released. I found it a big disappointment, sloppily put together, arguably not even the best bits of the show thus far. Some of the ""Better know a district"" segments didn't even have the lead in, just jumped straight to the interview (e.g. John Hall). No doubt that the show is one of the funniest things on TV, and I'm a huge Colbert fan, but this DVD was very, very disappointing.",1194307200,34,452,4.329411764705882

TCR is so sharp, so funny and brings such insightful commentaries, not just on the latest news but on the state of the US and the occidental world as a whole, that I feel this DVD will be as relevant now to remind all the fun as it will be in a couple of years to reflect on what we went thru.
I'd say it's a must buy and hell, for me to say this with the exorbitant international shipping costs, is definitely saying something.

Anyone familiar with The Colbert Report and some of Stephen Colbert's now infamous moments and vocabulary inventions know that this DVD is going to be one of the best things released in quite a long time. For me, not knowing the extent of the content at this point only makes me more excited in anticipation.
