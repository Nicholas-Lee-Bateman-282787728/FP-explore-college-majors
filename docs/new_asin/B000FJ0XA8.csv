8123525,4,B000FJ0XA8,"I found Play Like Me to be a wonderful experience to learn piano, most especially for an older adult who would otherwise want to play like you have been playing for years and are not happy with the slow boring basic learning books.. I can only fault Play Like me in one way.. they should have placed a bright marker over middle C on the keyboard of the piano, the overhead view as shown makes it very hard to figure out where his hands are playing... I do not know how they managed to overlook this big error... if you stick with this and it is easy to stick with, you will enjoy the experience and the results will carry you on to new challenges.. I wish they would come out with more tunes...  Play like me turns your piano investment into something you will enjoy not regret... BUY IT NOW and see the results in days...
