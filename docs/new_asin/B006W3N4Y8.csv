8505325,3,B006W3N4Y8,"I didn't care for the beginning, where the person who is filming is riding behind another bike rider. Thankfully it didn't last long. After that, the countryside and the filming of it is wonderfully done. The protective lens or lens cover needed to be cleaned though. Depending on how the sun light hits the camera, you can see that the lens or cover are not clean. That is somewhat distracting, but it only happens 2 or 3 times during the video.
The countryside is awesome and the towns are quaint, quiet and very clean. I did not care for the choice of music either. I much prefer the natural sounds of nature, i.e. birds, bees, wind, etc. It makes it feel a lot more as if you're truly out there, enjoying the scenery.
Great pace, great variety of scenery and mostly beautifully done!",1358208000,,787,4.510489510489511
8505326,5,B006W3N4Y8,"Sometimes I just have it playing in a corner of my computer screen while I'm writing.  I'm sure it would be perfect for use in front of a bicycle exerciser or a jogging treadmill as intended, but you don't have to run or ride to let this perfect hour transport you to a place of calm beauty.  The production is very well done.  If there were a road-of-the-month club from this company, I'd subscribe.  In the meantime, I'm getting to be a regular on this road, and it's fun to think that I might make a trip someday to do it in person.",1332806400,2,535,4.165048543689321
8505327,5,B006W3N4Y8,"The time passes quickly on my exercise bike as I feel I am really on the road in France. I love to watch the sports cars passing me. Nice guitar music as well. We all need to keep our new year's resolution to get in shape and this is one way I am keeping mine. Worth the purchase price, got the dvd in a timely manner as well.",1327881600,2,326,3.8088235294117645
8505328,5,B006W3N4Y8,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD while on my exercise bike. The first time I worked out with it, I rode my bike for the whole duration of the video because it felt like I was riding in France on a beautiful road trip!

I like the time indicators that let you know you've been exercising for 15, 30, 45 minutes.

I also like the little indications about the beaujolais wine vats, and the rabbit. The tractor and the cool collectors sports cars make it very enjoyable and fun.

The music is very easy listening and relaxing, with a perfect French touch to it.

I traveled in France a few years ago, and I love the DVD because it makes me feel like I'm really there again. It's a great road trip through the Beaujolais region of France for less than 20 bucks!
