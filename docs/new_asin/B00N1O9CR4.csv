His style is similar to the Comprehensive Beginner Chess Course if you watched that series. Damian lectures at a moderate (not fast) pace, he explains the purpose/ideas behind every move from the beginning (he does not rapidly click through some parts, like the opening or ""non-critical"" middle game parts, as some other presenters), and he is clear and understandable. For example, after the first few moves, Damian would often stop and explain the main ideas about the particular opening, not assuming the viewer knows the opening. Another thing I like about Damian is that he gets down to business; there is no 5 minute speech at the beginning of the video, maybe 30 seconds, and then he says lets get started. I love it! To the point! My 7 year old son watched every video from the Manifesto series. My son watched the videos with a physical chessboard and chess pieces in front of him, and he played through the games while Damian lectured. Damians pace and explanations are so perfect that my son easily followed the lectures. I hope that Damian makes a Manifesto 2.",1409011200,6,1206,4.854368932038835
