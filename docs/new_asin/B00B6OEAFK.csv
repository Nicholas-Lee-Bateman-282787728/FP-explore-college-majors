8563363,5,B00B6OEAFK,"A great documentary for all football fans, and anyone who loves sports. A story about an iconic club (Liverpool FC), the most loyal fans and one of the true cathedrals of football (Anfield). A chance to see the players up close and personal, and learn about their lives outside of the football pitch. Wonderfully narrated by Clive Owen and great to see Daniel Craig (a big Liverpool fan) make an appearance!",1363305600,4,407,4.746478873239437
