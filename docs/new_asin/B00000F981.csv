7907815,4,B00000F981,"Hits Out of Hell is fifty-eight minutes and was released on VHS on June 4, 1991. Of the nine songs in this video only three are actual videos the others six are Meat Loaf and his band performing on stage. This would have been better if it was a live concert video. The three videos that look like a mini movie are Razor's Edge, More than You Deserve, and If You Really Want To. The making of the three videos look like it was done at Low Budget Studios. The video covers the time period of 1978 through 1983. Die hard Meat Loaf fans will love and others like will be left wanting more. Hits Out of Hell gets a B+.
