8013262,1,B0001J2KJO,"The tape I received was very bad, recorded in the EP mode  There was poor tracking as is usually the  case. with  EP tapes..  The  picture  was faded and the sound was terrible  with  some kind of  cross talk so  that  you  could understand very little of  what  was  being  said  or  sung.
It was  shrink  wrapped, so I assume it was the fault of the manufacturer and not the seller.  I saw the film when it first came out and wanted to own it,  but this tape was horrible in every  way.",1469750400,,488,4.010752688172043
8013263,1,B0001J2KJO,"This version of Brecht & Weill's masterpiece, suffers greatly from being transferred from a very, VERY, poor quality master film print.  Scratched, poorly spliced, faded images...the surface quality of the master print used is a serious detraction from the viewing of the dvd.

This is a copy of a copy of the German/French production that was released via Video Yesteryear, thusly, no picture of the film in the Amazon description.

To see Sammy Davis Jr.'s interpretation of the Street Singer is almost fun.  It is (his portrayal) is very close to a Brechtian interpretation of the role.  However, it is quite obvious that all of his (Sammy') segments are shot in front of a rear-screen projection of the rest of the film, and, were spliced in for the American release of the film.  Sadly, some of his bits actually overlap the start of musical numbers in the film, and, the actual full character performance of those singing is somewhat lost.

The dubbing of the English in this film is next to atrocious, almost as if watching a very ""B""-level samurai film at times.

Musical numbers are rearranged, edited, cut short...and missing is Brecht/Weill's masterpiece, 'PIRATE JENNY'. (Along with 'BALLAD OF THE EASY LIFE', and the tour de force 'CALLS FROM THE GRAVE' for Macheath.)  It is quite apparent where this film does take some cues from the 1931 German version of 1931 (which really changed the story line and song order), as well as gave some insipiration to the 1989 version of the work (MACK THE KNIFE) which suffered from poor interpretation of the material, despite a stellar cast that included Raul Julia as the title role, reprising some of his amazing performance from the Joseph Papp produced version of THREEPENNY for the New York Shakespeare Festival in the 1976. The latter film (MACK THE KNIFE) was released on VHS, sadly, not on DVD...even if just for comparison purposes.

It is rumored that a new version using motion capture process is due out in 2012, featuring the work of Nick Cave and Andy Serkis.  Hopefully they will settle on a decent translation (Mannheim-Willets, as Papp used for his 1976 staging, or, if need be, the Blitzstein softened version that has tended to be the norm since the 1950's).

At any rate, there has yet to be a fully satisfying film version of this amazing stage piece.",1299542400,4,2325,4.843434343434343
