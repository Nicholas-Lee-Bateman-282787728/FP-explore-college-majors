7795042,4,0981849156,"The DVD plays for under 30 minutes, not long, but the teacher runs through a number of techniques for your masseuse to work on you.  This DVD is useful if you want to learn massages that stimulate the body before ovulation.  It is focused on the pre ovulation stage.  Unfortunately, if you are seeking treatment, this DVD does not totally focus on self massage: time to get your partner to watch it with you.  However, there were techniques that you can self apply as well as foot flexilogy.  The teacher references to a technique to help you bring your baby spirit to communicate and enter the embryo... Very spiritual and has a focus on the understanding of the Universla energy that I found useful to understand what some of the massages were meant to achieve.  The teacher also mentioned that kissing is very good to relax the hips, she has a theory why lots of kissing is helpful in conception!  A lot of information packed in this 30 minutes space. And very different from the yoga practice.",1294790400,7,997,4.598870056497175
7795043,5,0981849156,"I am a licensed massage therapist, and I recently took Claire's Nurturing the Mother Fertility Massage Specialist training course and I bought 4 of her DVD's, including the Fertility Massage DVD. I am throughly impressed with everything that Claire does. Her approach is in sync with everything that I believe. It is my philosophy that we have the ability to heal ourselves but sometimes we need a little help from those who have a healing touch. Claire's Fertility Massage course and DVD have given me some amazing tools to help couples who want to concieve a child. I am very excited to bring Claire's work into my practice.",1237766400,9,626,4.805555555555555
