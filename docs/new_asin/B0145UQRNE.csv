7384012,5,B0145UQRNE,Incredibly funny show.,1447891200,3,22,6.666666666666667
7384013,5,B0145UQRNE,"Besides ""Impractical Jokers"", this is the funniest show on television, HANDS DOWN.",1447632000,4,82,5.916666666666667
7384014,5,B0145UQRNE,"This show could either be a comedy or a brilliant piece of performance art, either way; Nathan For You is one of the best shows on this century.",1447632000,16,144,4.178571428571429
7384015,5,B0145UQRNE,One of the best programs on TV right now,1447372800,6,40,3.5555555555555554

7384017,5,B0145UQRNE,"If you've already seen every episode then this probably isn't worth it. You get a grand total of about 4 minutes of unaired material (no exaggeration). There is also two episodes that have commentary which is pretty funny.

I still gave it 5 stars just because the show is so good.",1505174400,6,281,4.509803921568627
7384018,5,B0145UQRNE,"One of the best tv shows of all times, hands down",1500940800,,49,3.5454545454545454
7384019,5,B0145UQRNE,"This is the funniest show I've ever seen.  I want it to be just successful enough that it keeps airing, but not successful enough that too many business owners know about it!  I just love this show more than I can describe.",1496188800,,223,4.285714285714286
7384020,5,B0145UQRNE,"I legitimately think this is the greatest show on TV right now.  I have laughed harder at this show than I have just about anything in my life.  To the point of light-headedness.  It was the funniest show on TV, but the ""I love you"" moment and the tightrope episode catapulted it in to an important examination of the human condition.  Cannot wait for season 4.",1495152000,3,361,4.424242424242424
7384021,5,B0145UQRNE,Great product and service,1494892800,2,25,5.5
7384022,5,B0145UQRNE,"One of the best shows and maybe most original i will ever watch (except for breaking bad). You ever watch one of those documentary type follow the host around shows where they are helping restaurants, or helping companies make millions? He makes fun of shows like that perfectly and does a great job narrating it. And his quirky self conceited type personality is the cherry on top.",1492646400,,382,4.7164179104477615
7384023,5,B0145UQRNE,I just wish they had season 3.,1492128000,2,30,3.4285714285714284
7384024,1,B0145UQRNE,"I found this show to be terrible and only watched 2 episodes and decided to return it. Nathan has idiotic ideas for businesses and in my opinion is wasting the time of business owners and me by watching this stupid show. There is some slight entertainment value but the show ""The Profit"" with Marcus Lemonis is 1000 times better.",1483315200,,329,4.593220338983051

7384029,5,B0145UQRNE,Funniest show ever! It's stupid humor so if you're not into that it won't be your show.,1455926400,2,87,4.176470588235294
7384030,5,B0145UQRNE,Hilarious!! The funniest part is that there is success in the insanity. My family and I just laugh out loud!!!,1453161600,5,110,4.55

7384033,5,B0145UQRNE,"This show is one of the funniest shows out there. It's definitely not for everyone though. If you thought Nacho Libre, Napoleon Dynamite, and Office Space were funny, then you will definitely like this. Also, hopefully most of you guys know that Nathan Fielder is faking his awkwardness (to the 1-star reviewer). Anyways, this show is definitely worth checking out and is laugh out loud worthy.",1450828800,7,394,4.984848484848484
7384034,5,B0145UQRNE,"This is an amazing program! It was actually very difficult at first, until I realized that It wasn't actually necessary(or even possible) to lift the entire moving van. I recommend starting out slowly with small items like pillows or couch cushions.",1449273600,,249,5.097560975609756
7384035,5,B0145UQRNE,"There is no way to describe this show, except it makes me cry with laughter.",1449273600,6,76,4.133333333333334
7384036,5,B0145UQRNE,"One of the funniest and original comedy reality shows EVER! I love everything he does!  You can actually buy the book ""The Movement"" from this current season on Amazon!  The best thing is people actually bought ""The Movement"" Exercise book thinking it was a real workout!",1448582400,5,271,4.869565217391305

Oh, and shipping went well, no damage to the disk, came with both seasons, not overly priced.

But yes, this is tops. Nathan Fielder knows no bounds.",1514592000,,214,4.325
