582931,3,6303168345,Kind of silly. John Waters is overrated. He's also somewhat perverse. Having somebody eating dog shit on film (as in Pink Flamingos) is disgusting and lowbrow.,1520035200,,159,5.153846153846154

583014,5,6303168345,"This mainstream effort by notorious underground filmmaker John Waters is kind of a tale of two movies.  The first part is a macabre black comedy about the dark impulses that lurk beneath the surface of suburbia.  Not bad but David Lynch did this more succinctly in his masterwork, ""Blue Velvet"".  The second half is infinitely more successful as a comic examination of the media's fascination with murder and mayhem and the ensuing celebrity culture.  The film kind of anticipates the O.J. Simpson media circus that occurred not long after this was released.  A stroke of genius on Waters' part to cast Patty Hearst, famed kidnapped heiress turned terrorist, as a juror who wears white shoes out of season.  The irony didn't escape me that there was an old lady in the film with a predilection for Bill Cosby movies who suffered the misfortune of being killed by a cooked ham.  Kathleen Turner delivers the requisite relish as Serial Mom as though she were a Waters vet.  I watched this with my wife with a little trepidation because her only previous exposure to a Waters flick was ""Crybaby"".  Surprisingly, she liked it.  I don't think I'll chance it with ""Pink Flamingoes"" or ""Female Trouble"", though.",1515715200,,1204,4.857843137254902

583076,5,6303168345,After a brief stint in Hollywood family friendly mainstream fare john waters returned to a more adult feature with serial mom.  The film is a parody of made for TV true crime flicks and it hits every note associated with that including time and date stamps/ disclaimers.  Kathleen Turner is perfect casting.

583133,5,6303168345,"There is the legal thing to do and the moral thing to do. Once in a while they may conflict. Mothers have an instinct for this sort of conflict. And this mother has the unique (final) solution. Only Kathleen Turner can carry this out as the demure conscience mother we wish we all had. I really liked the courtroom scene where she puts on a classic defense.

An added bonus is the appearance of Traci Lords (Roger Corman's film ""Not of This Earth"" 1988) as Carl's Date.

If viewing a tape instead of a DVD,
DO NOT FORGET TO REWIND THIS TAPE.",1501372800,,541,4.294117647058823

Said to be based loosely on the case of a real serial mom, the movie contains dark humor and some not-so-dark humor.

584382,5,6303168345,"Sometimes it's sad when you look at a certain actor or actresses careers and see how they at one time had it all and now have nothing.  Kathleen Turner is one of those actresses.  From the early 80's until the mid-90's she was on fire, and `Serial Mom' marks both the high, and probably the end, of her career.

At least she went out with a bang.

John Waters charming murder film stars Turner as Beverly Sutphin, a caricature of a suburban mother who protests against swearing, encourages healthy eating and is an advocate for recycling.  She is also crazy.  The film starts by exploiting her secret sin; that of harassing her neighbor with prank phone calls and threatening letters all because she stole a parking spot from her.  Then she plots the murder of another neighbor because she won't recycle and winds up delving into serious criminal activity with reckless abandon, including murdering the boy who stood up her overweight daughter or the teacher who talked poorly of her son.  She then goes completely off the deep end, as the authorities and her neighbors start to point the finger at her as the `serial mom'.

With complete control of comedic timing, Turner is flawless here.  She chews the scenery to perfection and creates this modified terror with such hilarious grace.  Her facial expressions, changing at the drop of a hat, all work together in unity to give off a brilliant aura.  The final courtroom scenes are hilarious and the highlights of the film.

This isn't a film for everyone, but if you ever want to embrace murder and mayhem as something `funny' then this is your film.",1376352000,,1602,4.719424460431655

584462,5,6303168345,"John Waters does it again with another classic that epitomizes his post-Divine era. Beverly R. Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) is an immaculate mother who recycles and listens to Barry Manilow. She lives in the Baltimore suburb with her dentist husband (Sam Waterston) and two children, Chip (Matthew Lillard) and Misty (Ricki Lake). Everything is seemingly normal except mom has some issues that she works out differently than most folks.

The film oozes with satire of the modern vs. 50's family, the celebrity status we bestow on criminals, plus other topics. I liked the background details such as the monster models I remember having as a kid as well as the Spiro Agnew painting in the courthouse. There were numerous memorable scenes and lines as in most Waters' films. Worth owning.

584468,5,6303168345,"I've been an admirer of John Waters for as long as I can remember. I grew up with movies like Cry Baby and Hairspray. As I grew older, I went to college and discovered Waters made movies that I had no idea even existed. I grew up in the drive in era and even I wasn't prepared for movies like Pink Flamingos and Desperate Living. They were shocking, revolting, and disgusting. I loved every minute of them. It amazed me how in a Waters' film the hero was normally the character that would be the villain in any other Hollywood made film. He made (still makes actually) movies that were not on the fringe of society, but movies that of their own society. Characters that felt like families. Crazy families yes, but families nonetheless.

Today I will be talking a look at a movie of Waters that fits somewhere between the two extremes. It isn't as ""light"" as Cry Baby or Hairspray but not as in-your-face as Pink Flamingos. The movie in question....1994's Serial Mom. Serial Mom came at a time in society in which America was becoming obsessed with the mass murderer and giving ""killers"" celebrity status. How else can you explain the thousands of marriage proposals Ted Bundy received in prison after confessing to the murder of over 20 young women? It may be a serial killer but isn't he dreamy! Nobody is perfect, right? Well, Serial Mom takes that celebrity obsession and turns it on its head.

As Serial Mom begins we meet Beverly Sutphin (in a go-for-broke pitch perfect performance by Kathleen Turner). She appears to be a typical suburban housewife living with her dentist husband Eugene (Sam Waterston) and their children, Misty (Ricki Lake) and Chip (Matthew Lillard) in the suburbs of Baltimore. Behind her Doris Day faade, however, she is a serial killer, murdering people over the smallest criticism, insult or slight. We open on the  Sutphin family having breakfast and Beverly carefully taking care of family's every needs until two police officers arrive to question the family about the mail threats and obscene phone calls to a fellow resident of the area, Dottie Hinkle (the wonderful Mink Stole). ""Now who on earth would ever want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle,"" Beverly states. Well of course it is Beverly. As we see a brief flashback, Beverly is still upset over Dottie stealing her parking spot at Jo Ann Fabrics. No, seriously.

The first murder she is known (the movie plays out like a true crime reenactment complete with time stamps) to commit occurs after Beverly attends a PTA where Mr. Stubbins, Chip's high school math teacher, criticizes her son's morbid fascination with violent horror films and recommends therapy for Chip. She runs him over with her car, killing him. How DARE he disrespect the horror genre! Bastard had it coming.

The following morning, Misty is upset when she gets stood up by a date, Carl Pageant, proclaiming her desire to kill him. Beverly cautions Misty about using words she doesn't mean and subsequently sees the police investigating her trash cans and her car. Beverly skillfully deflects the cops' questions before her husband asks the cops to leave. Later, seeing Carl with another girl at a local indoor swap meet, Beverly impales him in a men's restroom with a fireplace poker that Rosemary, who came along, had purchased.

A death by blow torch for not wearing a seatbeat and a killing by rack of lamb to the tune ""Tomorrow"" from the movie Annie for not rewinding Ghost Dad are two more deaths for Beverly before she is arrested. Now it is on to the trial and this is where the movie really kicks into high gear. Selling everything from Serial Mom t-shirts to Serial Mom books...everyone is off to make a profit off Beverly. Even Suzanne Somers (in a wonderful tongue-in-cheek performance as herself) who plans to play Beverly in the soon to be made mini-series.

Serial Mom is that perfect pitch black satire Hollywood never makes. The film was a bomb on its initial release grossing only $6 million on a $14 million profit and that's a shame. From the game cast to spot on direction from Waters, everything works. This is the type of movie that you will either find hysterical or you will wonder where all the laughs are. This movie makes me smile like a naughty little kid and I try to watch it every Mother's Day with my mom. If that isn't love, I don't know what is.",1343347200,,4337,4.713720316622691

She murders people for the most trivial of reasons and progressively does so with less and less care to cover up her tracks. Her clueless family slowly begins to realize that something is not altogether right with dear old Mom, who up to now has been a model of motherhood. Turner doesn't carry the weight of the whole film on her shoulders, however.

584538,5,6303168345,"Serial Mom, is easily my second favorite comedy of all time; with The Naked Gun being the first. I first saw this movie on HBO once it was released on VHS those many years ago, and I have seen it multiple times, and for me, it never get's old.

Beverly Sutphin (played fantastically by Kathleen Turner) on the outside, is your typical run-of-the-mill suburban house wife; she is devoted to her husband Eugene (Sam Waterston) and her kids Misty (Ricki Lake) and Chip (Matthew Lillard), but deep on the inside, she is obsessed with keeping her lifestyle perfect on how she see's fit, and will go out of her way to make sure that the people in her life (minus her kids and her husband, who she see's perfect in her eyes) live up to her code on how she see's things; recycling, wearing seat belts, and being good model citizens. If they don't live up to her way of life, she kills them. Literally. If they witness her killing someone, they die.

People get killed along the way; the first one is Chip's math teacher Mr. Stubbins, who criticizes Chip's unhealthy obsession to gory horror movies (Mr. Stubbins caught Chip drawing a graphic picture during class) in front of Chip's mother. Seeing him as a threat, she kills him by running him over with her station wagon. Other's follow; including Misty's boyfriend (who was seeing another girl when he was seeing Misty), she kills him in the men's bathroom with a fire poker, Chip's friend Scotty (setting him on fire during a live concert in front of hundreds of eye witnesses), killing one of Chip's customers at the video store that he works at (because she doesn't rewind her VHS tapes before she returns them), and Mr. and Mrs. Hinkle (Mr. Hinkle is a client to Eugene's dentist office, as Mr. Hinkle doesn't follow Eugene's orders to stop eating sweets as it is rotting his teeth).

Her husband Eugene deny's that his wife would never hurt a fly, until he discovers a tape from Ted Bundy telling her ""That it's cold here on death row."", along with paper clippings of famous murderers; Charles Manson being one of them. Shocked, he try's to figure out what is making her snap and killing everyone. Her kids eventually find out and try to stop her from killing someone else.

The trial scene is just flat-out hilarious; along with the rest of the film. She portrays herself to the jury that she is just a normal house-wife and that she couldn't hurt anybody, and hilarity follows with some of her tactics that will definitely raise some eye-brows.

Serial Mom, in a sense, is a dark comedy. This movie is NOT for everyone; it is dark comedy, and some of the things she does will make you wonder ""Is any suburban house-wife able to commit anything like this?"" Well, Serial Mom does, and it definitely knocks it out of the park with great writing on John Waters part, great direction (again, done by John Waters), and the actors and actresses look like they were having fun with these roles (especially Kathleen Turner). If you are a fan of dark comedies, pick this one up.",1313625600,,3019,4.583333333333333
584539,5,6303168345,"Serial Mom....totally hilarious with plenty of dark humor and original. I loved it and it inspired more dark humor in my next book. Two thumbs up from Cameron (my son) and me!

Watch out for those soccer moms LMAO
I told my boys, ""See, see- more serial killers are soccer mom type of women and they get away with it too for much longer, have a higher body count and are more brutal than most male serial killers.

584595,5,6303168345,"""Serial Mom"" is a comedic take on 1950's TV sitcoms that featured mothers like June Cleaver who wore pearls and dresses (never pants) and who kept their homes cleaned to perfection while at the same time making sure their husbands and children had wonderful meals. These same moms also demanded their family members never swear, go to school and get good grades, and become impeccable people. Kathleen Turner plays one of these mothers, but unbeknownst to her splendid family, is a crazed psycho who goes on a killing rampage when people don't live up to her expectations. For example, she kills an old woman with a leg of lamb when the old woman doesn't rewind a VHS tape she rented from a video store!
 The movie is really funny and Kathleen Turner (who plays Serial Mom) is having a blast playing a part that was made for her. Some of her best scenes are the ones in which she harrrasses a neighbor on the phone, calling her foul names and using explicit language.
 ""Serial Mom"", unfortunately, wasn't a big hit at the boxoffice, but has become popular from regular TV airings and releases on the home video market. This particular DVD release features the film in widescreen format, has audio commentary with director John Walters and Kathleen Turner, as well as interviews with some of the cast members.

The film is a spoof on serial killers, horror movies and wholesome family values. They particularly make fun of the latter, something filmmakers love to do anyway, being of the unwholesome types they are themselves.

584656,4,6303168345,"""Serial Mom,"" (1994), a gory comic crime caper that's another in director John Waters' wickedly twisted salutes to Baltimore, Maryland, his home town, had been difficult to get for years; it now is available in this deluxe version with some interesting, entertaining commentaries that make it even better worth the price.

First things first: it's very entertaining, but it is, of course, a one-joke movie. That being that title character Beverly R. Sutphin,( played by Kathleen Turner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peggy-Sue-Got-Married/dp/B004L8BM90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peggy Sue Got Married</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-of-the-Roses/dp/B004MPEL5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War of the Roses</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-Heat/dp/B001HTD0DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body Heat</a>), is a buttoned down 1950s suburban housewife in the June Cleaver mold. Yet she also happens to be, occasionally, a juicy serial killer - -though she claims the only cereal she knows anything about is Rice Krispies. She is portrayed as the last suburbanite you'd want to live near: a woman so obsessed with doing things the right - suburban--way that she kills one neighbour for not separating her recyclables, and another neighboring kid for unceremoniously dumping her daughter. They say, by the way, that Waters' original choice for the part was Susan Sarandon, but she was too expensive: that's just as well, as, anyone who's seen the picture can tell you, Turner made the part her own. Sam Waterston, who would achieve wider recognition as a U.S. President on American television, plays Beverly's husband, Eugene Sutphin, D.D.S. (a gormless dentist). Waters' regular Ricki Lake plays their daughter Misty; Matthew Lillard plays their son Chip. Another Waters' regular, Mink Stole, is along as Dottie Hinkle, another cross-dressed suburban housewife. Former porn queen Traci Lords twinkles, fully-dressed, in a bit part. The closing courtroom scenes are hilarious, as Beverly achieves celebrity defendant mode in her hometown, long before the O.J. Simpson murders and trial. Notorious heiress Patricia Hearst, who was kidnapped by crazed radical left-wingers in the late 1970's, and paid dearly for the privilege, is very funny as Juror #8, the one wearing the white shoes after Labor Day: don't you just love the conversation in which she desperately tries to convince Beverly that fashion has changed its views in that matter? And Suzanne Somers is along playing her usual pixilated self.

The movie's got some of Waters' typical touches: an autographed photo of Charles Manson; an actual Christmas card made and sent by John Wayne Gacy, and his own (Waters' voice) as Ted Bundy's, on a cassette found under Beverly's bed: you see, she collects serial killer memorabilia. And it's time to say now; he's a very good woman's director: even if that woman is a cross-dressed man (see Divine in the director's original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hairspray-1988/dp/B0030U3VR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hairspray (1988)</a>), which, let's agree, was a wonderful creation of his. In fact, Waters, who recently did a whistle-stop tour, and stopped here -- this is off message as they say, please forgive me -- said he was most proud of two things in regard to HAIRSPRAY. If any local theater or college group decided to do the play, there'd be a part in it for a fat girl; and one for a cross-dresser. The man just loves his twisted sisters, doesn't he? And he's created a fine one here.",1213228800,,3676,5.9209039548022595
584657,4,6303168345,"This was my first John Waters movie-so it's definately my favorite by him, one of my favorite Kathleen Turner movies-2nd being War o/the Roses.
Now, to the review.
Aside from two graphically violent scenes-this movie is a twisted riot!
The prank phone call scene, her twisted sense of morality and the murders leading up to the trial were hilarious!
I just found out it's getting the collector's edition treatment...I WANT IT!
I have the first edition on DVD, worth everything, this edition will not change my opinion of the film. I've loved it since I was 13(27 now) I wish I didn't have to wait till May, oh well.

Feb. 16, 2010
I wish I could update my review, because I've got some new praise for the movie. I now have the coll. edition, watched it twice with the commentary-with John Waters and Kathleen Turner, and it sounds like from that, Kathleen had a lot of fun with this film, who wouldn't? The features are perfect, the picture is much clearer, subtitles are on every feature, I've heard Ms. Turner wasn't interested in doing the movie until she read the script-according to the commentary, that rumor was essentially false, although I think John Waters was insistent on having her play her.
The commentary with John is pretty funny too, I heard it numerous times in the other edition, and though it's somewhat outdated, it's still pretty informative not to mention entertainment, I can certainly relate to the idea that this film was clearly ahead of its time.",1208044800,,1474,4.735408560311284

584703,5,6303168345,John Waters did a terrific job on this movie.  The casting is great.  I can't believe they got Kathleen Turner to do the things she did in this movie.  The movie starts out all sweet and cute with family breakfast and then some detectives stop by to question folks in the neighborhood about a lady in the neighborhood who is being sent some pretty nasty mail.  Once the detectives and kids leave we then get a glimpse into the world of Beverly Sutfid while she makes a prank phone call.  This entire scene is destined to be a comedy classic...Serial Mom then goes on a killing spree because some people have insulted her and her family.  This movie is funny!!!!!!!!,1172793600,3,665,4.5
584704,5,6303168345,"This film was made in 1994, a few years after ""Cry-Baby"". John Waters has a Hollywood sized budget to work with and continues his path to more ""mainstream"" targeted movies. But for those fans who fear this would compromise Waters' humour - don't worry, it doesn't.

""Serial Mom"" has the qualities that many mainstream comedies lack. It can be seen as satire, or you can just turn your brain off and have lots of fun. The dialogue is hysterical and the cast does a wonderful job, especially Kathleen Turner in the title role. In this film, she makes one of the greatest comedic roles in film history. I also love Mink Stole as the neighbor and unknown Patsy Grady Abrams as Emmy Lou, a customer in the local video store who only rents family films - and doesn't rewind!

While this is quite different from the films Waters made 20 years earlier, it is by no means worse. This may very well be his best movie, and one of my favorite comedies ever. I would recommend it to Waters fans as well as those who aren't yet familiar with him. If you buy the region 1 DVD you get a nice director's commentary.",1151193600,5,1098,4.403940886699507

It's worth watching for Kathleen Turner's performance alone, but the rest of the cast is just wonderful as well, making this one of my absolute favorites. I've always been a big fan of John Waters' films because he uses all different types of people...from the beautiful Kathleen Turner to the not-so attractive character of Dottie Hinkle. It just makes his movies seem more real, no matter how surreal they truly are. Strongly recommended!",1138320000,7,593,4.881188118811881

584707,5,6303168345,"I thought this movie was a riot the first time I saw it.  I was only vaguely aware of John Waters at the time, as he had hit it big with Hairspray a few years before.  Watching this movie you can catch the little digs and subleties (the gal from L7 showing off her camel toe, that really filthy porn movie the friend Scottie is watching, etc.) here and there.  Kathleen Turner plays the Divine role very well as the suburban housewife on the edge of exploding.  Beverly is so obsessed with perfection and keeping her world in line that she snaps.  The obscene calls to her neighbor Dottie (all because she cut her off in the parking lot at Joanne Fabrics) are hilarious.  She kills the woman for not rewinding her video tapes before returning them, and even contemplates murder against her literbug neighbor for not recycling.

This was probably John Waters's salute to the courtroom groupie phenomena.  We can turn mass murderers into celebrities, although I wish he had captured more of the party aspect of it rather than the sale of T shirts and merchandise.  Patty Hurst is even in it, and if you didn't know otherwise John Waters was one of the Patty Hurst groupies back in the day.  Suzanne Sommers even makes an appearance, in probably her most signifigant screen role to date, just being herself.  It was a good time and captures one of John Waters's many obsessions.",1129593600,24,1375,4.594262295081967

584752,4,6303168345,"SERIAL MOM is one of John Waters' more mainstream movie offerings and thus lacks the edge of earlier efforts (PINK FLAMINGOES, POLYESTER), though does have Kathleen Turner in one of her most accomplished tour-de-forces.

Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) seems like your ordinary stay-at-home wife and mother, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Anyone who crosses her path and defiles her code of morals is instantly killed or abused, starting with neighbour Dottie Hinkle (Mink Stole) whom Beverly harrasses with shocking prank phonecalls after Dottie rudely cut her out of a parking space.  Then there's the boy who broke daughter Misty's heart, impaled by a Franklin Mint fire-poker; the rude man who doesn't floss, crushed by his airborne cooler-unit; the woman who doesn't rewind her videos, bludgeoned by a lamb chop, and the list goes on...!

Beverly's murder trial takes on a life of it's own and becomes a media circus.  Suzanne Somers is the frontrunner to play Beverly in a TV miniseries and Beverly acts as her own defence.  Too bad about the annoying juror (Patty Hearst) who is wearing white shoes after Labour Day...

Kathleen Turner glows in her ghoulishly-gleeful turn as Beverly.  John Waters directs a fine cast (including Waters stalwarts Mink Stole and Ricki Lake).

This movie is simply delightful off-kilter comedy at it's best.  Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard play Beverly's teens Misty and Chip with Sam Waterston as Beverly's guileless husband.  The cast also includes Traci Lords, Scott Wesley Morgan, Walt MacPherson, Justin Whalin, Patricia Dunnock,  Lonnie Horsey and Mary Jo Catlett.",1113868800,31,1625,5.231660231660232

Whether it's a neighborhood woman rudely taking her parking space, Dottie Hinkle (Mink Stole), a teacher telling her her son is morbid and watches too many horror movies and that maybe his sick imagination is due to her parenting skills, or a boy that stands her daughter up and doesn't treat her the right way.

Now as for the problem that goes unaddressed and isn't really shouted out in Bold type face by amazon.... the DVD box is a carbboard board with a plastic clasp. Not only do these Warner Brother's style DVD boxes fail to fit in to a standard DVD rack or fit snuggly in your collection of other normal boxed DVDs, but the whole case doesnt work after repeated use over a short period of time.

Take a look around:
We live in a day where psychotic soccer-moms are killing teenage girls (or, at least *contracting* to do so), so that their own daughter will win the high school cheerleading competition.
Where slightly obese fathers are beating other fathers to death who, while acting as coach, make a call that upsets the ""home team"".....all while the fourth graders watch from the stands.
Where mothers contract to hire a professional killer to murder the likely-winner of the home-town beauty competition so that her own homely daughter will take first place.
Where mothers drown not one, not two, not three, not four, but FIVE of her children to ""protect"" them from the ever-sneaky Lucifer.
Where fathers hold their children hostage at gun-point because their wives accidently taped over the husband's tape of ""Footballs Greatest Bone-Breaks"" with ""The View.""
This is our world people.  These are true stories, and one could fill pages upon pages by simply clicking on your local news.  So ask yourself, how far off is this movie? Not far at all kiddies.
That being said, let me say this:
This movie is priceless Waters.  Personally, I think it's his most clever, best directed, most well-written film he's ever done (with ""Pecker"" reigning at #2).  The depravity with which Kathleen Turner portrays Mrs. Everymom, USA is just absolutely brilliant.  It's perfect.
If you're at all familiar with Waters (and chances are, if you're looking at this review, you are), definitely do not hesitate to get this DVD.  It's funny from start to finish, and while definitely dark, hits extremely close to each of our homes.  Waters realizes just how absurd our world is, and reminds us with this film.

This one, while it might appear to be otherwise, is not for everyone. Not by a long shot. Many scenes I exploded in laughter. I think you will too. If not, then you get a great performance by Turner, who hasn't been this good in eons.",1003190400,5,910,4.729559748427673

I love the way that he takes the seemigly perfect family and make the pisture perfect ""June CLeaver"" mom into a serial killer. My favorite part has got to be the reason that she wants to kill Dottie Hinkle and how she torments her. You have got to see this movie.

584812,4,6303168345,"Let me just start by saying: I LOVE this movie. I've had the VHS version for quite some time now and I never got tired of it.
However, I was a little disappinted by the lack of features on this DVD. I thought it would have behind-the-scenes footage (if it did, I would give it 5 stars).
After seeing other movies with commentary, I was really surprised that John Waters' commentary was excellent. It really explains a lot about the movie (and some of the lesser known actors). Sometimes it almost compensates for the lack of the other features normally seen on DVD.
Okay, back to the movie itself. Like other Waters' films, the plot focuses on a particular social problem (in this case, the fame gained being a serial killer and also about the death penalty). Kathleen Turner is outstanding as an old-fashioned mom with high morals who goes nuts and kills people for very minor infractions (chewing gum, for example). When she is caught, she defends herself in court (with hillarious results!)
Again, this is a great movie, but I could only give it four stars because of the features on the DVD version.",992995200,6,1103,4.63265306122449
584813,5,6303168345,This movie is just hilarious. It is one of my favorites of all time and probably my favorite John Waters movie. Kathleen Turner gives a tour-de-force performance. It keeps you interested the whole movie. A truly twisted masterpiece.,992217600,,232,5.131578947368421
584814,5,6303168345,"John Waters is the true gross-out artist, perfecting the craft before those two obnoxious brats who created ""South Park"" learned their first dirty words. While in the past 20 years his films have not been as visually shocking as ""Pink Flamingos"" or his other early films, he's never lost his wonderfully twisted sense of humor.
""Serial Mom"" is, perhaps, his greatest achievement of his later works starting with ""Polyester"" and going from there. A brilliant twist on bland sitcom suburbia (Kathleen Turner fits the title role perfectly) mixed with biting commentary about the media hype surrounding trials (and especially since it came out shortly before the OJ Simpson trial).
Waters' DVD commentary is always funny and insightful, especially herein. The other extras are okay, but the commentary is what makes the DVD a good buy.",988934400,2,831,5.162962962962963

Sure, its funny, and has its' share of gratuitous 'funny' homicide, but Kathleen Turner as the Serial Mom is an utter failure. It just doesn't work, right from the opening frames. I spent the entire course of the film wondering who else could have played the role better, when I noticed that it had gotten over. Ah well. No big loss.",971740800,,444,4.36144578313253
584817,4,6303168345,"A deliciously dark comedy from John Waters who also directed other great films such as Cry Baby (1990) and Hairspray (1988).  The crazy plot is centered around a surburban housewife, Beverley Surphin (marvelously played by Kathleen Turner), who lives with her husband (Sam Waterston) and her two fine teenage kids (including Ricki Lake) in a beautiful Baltimore home. However if anybody annoys her, even for the most trivial of matters, she kills them. Such hilariously over the top incidents include her childs tutor telling her that her son is not as academically clever as other students - for this she runs him over. An arrogant middle aged woman that is always continually rude to her son at his workplace in a video shop -for this she again kills her. Sounds absolutley preposterous  to read about but this crazy black comedy actually is very funny throughout, thanks to a fast and furious dialogue and an excellent performance from Kathleen Turner.

584818,5,6303168345,I think this is the greatest movie I have ever seen.  Kathleen Turner was the greatest .  Sam Waterston proved he could be a comedy actor as well as  a serious actor.  I have seen this movie 100 times and I am still watching  it.,969408000,,229,4.0
584819,5,6303168345,"This film speaks directly to me.  All the conflict in the movie revolves around Dottie Hinckle stealing Beverly Sutphin's parking space at the  fabric store. Suburban nightmare!  She can't deal with anything out of  wack in her perfect world.  The satire is dead on and the humor is top  notch.  Plus you'll learn a repertoire of lines to say from now until the  cows come home:  ""Those are beautiful pussywillows"",  ""Rewind! "", ""Lick mommy's feet, make them all nice and  wet."", ""You're  wrong, fashion has changed.""  It's a very  intelligent movie so beware of dopes telling you it's no good.",966729600,3,594,4.81
584850,3,6303168345,"I am a hardcore Waters fan, but this is not my favorite film of his. I can't really think of anything I would want to change about it, however,  other than maybe setting it in the 50's or 60's so Van Smith could have  worked his costume magic. But even my least favorite Waters film beats most  movies. If another director had filmed this, then based on the subject  matter, I probably wouldn't have had any interest in seeing it. But hey,  any movie containing the credits ""Written and Directed by John  Waters"" (in this case, the credit is superimposed over an image of a  pulverized fly who has just been swatted by the title character...he always  picks the best shots for his credit, doesn't he?) I'm there, no matter what  the premise is. Waters' films often center on 'troubled' but lovable female  characters, and this one is no exception. Kathleen Turner does a great job  portraying Beverly Sutphin, a June Cleaver-esque, devoted happy homemaker  who doesn't even allow gum in her house, but has a short fuse and keeps a  secret scrapbook (I wonder if it was from Waters personal collection) of  clippings about serial killers. We don't know how long she's been killing,  but the first half of the film follows a week in her life and the various  neighbors and acquaintances she dispatches simply because they get on her  nerves. Ever momentarily had an urge to kill someone when they stole a  parking spot from you, badmouthed a member of your family, or committed an  obvious fashion violation? Most women don't act on it, but Serial Mom sure  does.
Again, only Waters could have pulled this movie and subject matter  off. If you're a Waters devotee, then you are well aware that criminal  behavior, trials, and serial killers are subjects near and dear to his  heart-this is a man who is a self-confessed ""trial groupie"". With  any other filmmaker, it could have been boring. Many probably would have  been extremely offended by a movie about a lovable serial killer played for  laughs (especially those who knew the victim of a violent crime) but the  tone of the movie is so light and over-the-top that only people with no  sense of humor could think it might condone murder. Who else but Waters  could think of a victim being bludgeoned to death with a slab of pork chop  (because she made the mistake of not rewinding a movie before she returns  it to the video store) while watching a videotape of ""Annie""?  This is not the funniest Waters movie I've seen, but it has its moments.  Among the funniest are the scenes where Beverly torments her neighbor Mink  Stole with hilariously obscene phone calls to drive her over the edge. Also  very amusing are scenes where Beverly's whitebread manner (""oh honey,  the only ""serial"" I know anything about is Rice Krispies!"")  contrasts with the horrified stares of her family and neighbors.
I have  to admit, I can't help but think how much more fun this movie would have  been if Waters' favorite leading lady was still with us. After seeing  Divine portray suburban mothers who are sweetnatured in general but can go  ballistic when pushed too far, every once in a while I catch myself  imagining what could have been...can't you just picture the look on Serial  Mom's face as portrayed by Divine when Mink Stole makes the mistake of  stealing a parking place from her in the supermarket lot?
Sadly, Divine  is now making Heaven flashy instead of acting, but casting Kathleen Turner  was also a stroke of genius. Turner is best in the moments when she goes  from a harmless Donna Reed to Charles Manson within seconds when someone  makes the mistake of annoying her- just watch her face. Waters fans should  also watch for cameos /small roles by Alan Wendel, Traci Lords, Susan Lowe,  Mary Vivian Pearce (I only recognized her from her distinctive voice) and  though he doesn't appear in the credits, Waters manages to work in Don  Knotts.
This is one of the few Waters films that I rent from time to time  rather than own, but it's still lots of fun. I'll take one of Waters less  memorable films over a teen slasher flick or anything starring Jean-Claude  Van Damme any day of the week.",966470400,12,4149,4.67174515235457
