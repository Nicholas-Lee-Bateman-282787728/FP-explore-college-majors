7875721,1,6304601859,Can a DVD with this cast be boring. This one proves that it can. Awful.,1444003200,,71,3.8
7875722,4,6304601859,"with interesting characters.  I did anticipate something BIG was going to happen but it never did.  Other than that, good show laddie!",1336521600,,134,5.045454545454546
7875723,5,6304601859,"It is true that the Thatcher-era market stuff in this film is a bit over the top, but it is true also that sometimes an exaggerated picture is best to illustrate the ills of a concept like Fleet Street greed.

For my money the best two parts of the movie are that the character of Daniel Pascoe commutes to work in an airplane and that Rebecca DeMornay is in it. I admit to being an absolute ninny over anything with Rebecca DeMornay in it, from 'Risky Business' on up. In 'Dealers' she plays Ann, a very self-assured American in a somewhat alien world, a character with yet hidden vulnerabilities and potential to grow as a human being. Her arrogance and confidence are to the fore when Daniel refuses to drive her home from Surrey and she walks out. The next thing he hears is the sound of his own airplane taking off from his own pond.

Among the most romantic, even sexiest, stunts pulled by a male character in love is the scene in which Pascoe inflates helium balloons through the keyhole of Ann's flat so that when she comes home the whole place is mysteriously full of balloons. Between that and driving around in a classic 1963 Facel Vega, this character was all about what I wanted to be at that time-- even if the sound of those '80s phones makes me want to rip them out of the wall today.

Also the soundtrack is great. My VHS copy is a bit worn from overuse and I can barely read the credits, so I'm looking forward to acquiring the DVD so I can see it better... and keeping it for posterity.",1200960000,,1505,4.329787234042553
7875724,3,6304601859,"I am not sure what the other reviews saw in this movie that was so great.  This is definately not at the level of a ""Wall Street"" or ""Working Girl"".  It is even a weak comparison to ""Capital City"".  The story is slow and doesn't exploit any opportunities to create any real drama.  The leading man's character and acting are unsat.  Rebecca carries the scenes with her acting, sensuality, and charisma.  Some of the other smaller roles develop very well, though.  The story, well....  What story.  I only watched this movie because it was another ""Finance Drama"".  We finance types love a good sea story.",1142467200,,604,4.666666666666667
7875725,5,6304601859,"This is a great movie.  The actual market stuff is a bit overdone - watch the market move in the climax scene - but it's definitely entertaining.  It's in my library and I pull it out at least once a year.  Wall Street is great, but I would actually put Dealers slightly above it.",1107388800,,280,4.148148148148148
7875726,5,6304601859,"If you are interested in movies about corporate scandals and suspense, this is one to watch. It's about a currency broker who commits suicide after he has lost over 100 million dollars in the markets and it's up to the stars of the film (Paul McGann and Rebecca DeMorney) to mark up the loss in a wild and crazy roller coast ride in the currency markets. It has a good story line and if you like ""Wall Street"" and ""Boiler Room"", you will love Dealers.",1097625600,3,451,4.317647058823529
7875727,4,6304601859,"Awesome is the beginning of this movie, shedding light
into corporate Britain. The life of Financial dealers
is shown and their breaking point is exposed.
Daniel Pascoe, maverick trader, has a difficult
time when his maestro and compadre Robby Barrell
is fired off the company. Still he finds how to
overcome difficulties. Once problems are over,
comes the time to think whether the perils
and stress are worth it...
Meeting beautiful Ann Schumann lets him understand what
""having all"" means.
The music is glorious (and hard to find,
unfortunately!)
Oh my, I wish this existed on DVD!
Something else: Perhaps from the same studio, they
realized later a tv series on the very same location
(I guess the series didn't pay off... and it wasn't
half the emotion of the movie... that should be the
reason why now only low-end government stations
broadcast the program...)",1025049600,4,866,4.979310344827586
7875728,5,6304601859,"I saw the movie and thought it was very good, a nice change of pace to see the British side of the stock market. Myself, I'll never play any stock market games because I've been on the other side of things ie. getting laid off from 2 jobs before Christmas Eve so some investors and brokers can afford higher priced Christmas parties. As for entertainment, I liked the movie very much and especially Rebecca DeMornay's acting effort. As for Dee or whatever your name is the correct spelling of her name is Rebecca DeMornay. But you must be one of those guys who've never seen a real woman naked before! The deed is done Jim.",983750400,2,623,4.426086956521739
7875729,4,6304601859,"This movie about English currency traders is exciting and intense.  If you are a trader and in need of motivation, you should definitely see this movie.  What I liked about it was that it showed the ups AND downs of  trading, hence a bit of realism.  For instance, what is a trader's life  like when he is unemployed?  It can be grim, as depicted.  However, the  realism is balanced by a somewhat implausbile scenario where US T-Bills  went from 98.00 to 88.00 in less that 10 minutes.  I don't think that kind  of volatility has ever hit the US bond market. Nonetheless, a great movie  that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  It would have  been much better if they showed Rebecca DeMournay naked.",955497600,11,719,4.430769230769231
