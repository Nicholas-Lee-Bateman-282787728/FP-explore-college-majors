7498071,5,B0179PIRQC,I love indie horror and this did not disappoint. Great storyline and acting was on point! Tammy Jean did an amazing job making me believe she was crazy. Asta also really did a fantastic job. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Loved the music choice and what a great ending! Hope to see more movies from these directors. Definitely recommend!,1456099200,5,358,4.4393939393939394

7498074,3,B0179PIRQC,"Mara (Tammy Jean) is a psycho-lesbian killer who makes up her victims as dolls. When Kat (Asta Paredes) enters her life, she doesn't want to kill her, but this causes other issues.

The characters were shallow. Acting wasn't much to speak about. The film was rather pointless.

F-bomb, F/F sex, ample nudity. 3 stars for the nudity.",1455408000,3,332,4.807017543859649
7498075,3,B0179PIRQC,"How in the world did this movie get such high ratings?The only thing I saw redeemable about it was the storyline. But the acting,the effects & the music were horrible. Also the ending was stupid.",1455321600,2,195,4.6

7498078,4,B0179PIRQC,"Sociopathia focuses on Mara (Tammy Jean), an introverted woman who creates costumes for low-budget movies. Her reclusive persona, however, conceals an uncontrollable impulse to kill. When shes hired by Kat (Asta Paredes), an up-and-coming producer, the two instantly hit it off. As their relationship grows more intense, Mara begins to lose her already tenuous grip on reality.

Films about psychopaths are usually intriguing, and Sociopathia falls squarely in that category. We watch Mara with voyeuristic interest as she goes about her Jekyll/Hyde life, a quiet, reserved young woman who at times becomes a maniacal murderer. Unlike fantasy horror films about monsters and supernatural creatures, those centering on mental aberration are not only creepy, but possible, as newspaper headlines attest. So films about such disturbed people register more strongly. Norman Bates in Psycho set the standard of an apparently normal person with a horrifying secret. Mara joins that group of movie characters.

Ms. Jean shoulders most of the films dramatic and terror moments. She believably conveys a woman with a double life, and because of this, we remain involved. The final section of the film appears rushed and perfunctory, tying things together far too quickly and unimaginatively, but those who like their horror films with plenty of blood and gore won't be disappointed.

Bonus features on the widescreen DVD release include deleted scenes, a black-and-white version, and trailer.",1454803200,8,1483,5.524229074889868
7498079,5,B0179PIRQC,"I was lucky enough to catch this film in the lower east side of New York city for its theater premier. It was a wonderful night and the film's directors and some of the cast attended. I was not sure what to expect as the film begun, knowing only it was a horror film and that I certainly am a horror fan. I am interested in independent films, and when one like this is released, I make an effort to try to see it.
The movie was fantastic. It was a slow and moody burner building from the first scene. I was not sure what was going to take place but I knew something was brewing. A dark constrictive, almost claustrophobic atmosphere engrosses this film as we meet Mara, a film prop designer by day, and a sick twisted killer by night. She is clearly conflicted, caught in a battle between living a normal productive life and giving in to her dark twisted desires. She is a quiet seductive black widow, luring beautiful love interests into her life, but then eventually submitting to her dark side and killing them. Mara is not the love them and leave them type. She is a love them and keep them type as she builds her own dead girl menagerie in her home's basement. I do not want to give too much plot away as this film is also a thriller with some twists, so all I can say is if you like movies like Maniac or American Mary, then dive into the madness and see for yourself.",1452988800,7,1374,4.208333333333333

7498081,1,B0179PIRQC,This has to be one of the worst movies my husband and I have ever seen. To call it a B movie is too good for it. It has a very thin story line and I would wager a guess that the actors have had no previous  acting experience. If you have about an hr and a half of time to waste that you never want to get back or get anything out if this movie may be for you.,1464480000,4,359,3.4875
7498082,1,B0179PIRQC,"If I could give no stars I would...worst movie, like a terrible student film. Acting was abismal. Wish I could get my money back.",1461715200,2,129,4.416666666666667
7498083,2,B0179PIRQC,"If you're a horror buff, it's a decent movie.  The lead actress is really very good in a role that has her cycling through personas at a mile per minute.  But the rest of the actors aren't as skilled, they could well have just come to the set from an amateur porn film.  There is gore, though the effects look low budget and sometimes I cringed at the fakiness of it all.  The writers had a promising idea, the cast and production just couldn't pull it off in a satisfying way.",1461456000,6,477,4.208791208791209
7498084,4,B0179PIRQC,"Basically Sociopathia feels almost like a remake of the Maniac remake.  The biggest difference is that the killer is a woman.
I don't get it.  So many people criticize the acting in this film, yet most people had no problems with the terrible acting in The Blair Witch film.
Some of the acting is flawed, but it doesn't hurt the movie much.  A lot of this film is still very effective.  The actresses are attractive and get nekkid.  The atmosphere is creepy.  It's not boring, and the character development is pretty damned good too.
Watch the Maniac movies first, as the original, and remake are better than this film.  However, as far as Maniac ripoffs go, this is one of the better ones.",1461024000,8,690,4.560975609756097
7498085,5,B0179PIRQC,"Very suspenseful, psychological thriller.  The dialogue, acting and direction were excellent.",1456617600,3,93,7.454545454545454
7498086,2,B0179PIRQC,"If you're expecting an actual horror film, pass on this. The accurate genre is exploitation, B-Horror in the vein of Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS. Lots of girl on girl action, a bit of gore, an outrageous story line that allows for gross things to happen such as the psycho lead bathing with a corpse. As a part of this genre, eh, the film works--there's a story line. I laughed more than I think I was intended to. But, it's cheaply made and the acting is mostly horrible. Unless you have a taste for this sort of thing, keep looking for something else.",1456531200,5,550,4.298076923076923
7498087,5,B0179PIRQC,"I love independent films and, I love horror films and psychological thrillers. Today, it feels like, if its not already a sequel, most big studio-produced features are so repetitive, duplicative and predictable that it's an immediate sense of ho hum, deja vu, unlike a small budget indie where you just never know what to expect -- that's what I want out of my couple hours viewing time. Surprises, good writing, some humor and new ways of looking at a genre.

In ""Sociopathia"" I got all that and more.  I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement, as there is in every creative endeavor, but because some of the production values could've benefitted with a little more money, greater creativity was exercised in other, more interesting ways.  For example, the writing really stepped up to the plate. Direction and pacing were excellent, eerie and entertaining, and kept me engaged and anticipating the next twist & turn. I was struck by the music and scoring as well and think it contributed significantly to the tension and sense of mystery.  Thought there were some really interesting sets and art direction that helped mimic the rapid disintegration of the protagonist's mental state. The characters were great and some of the acting was terrific. {And man, can that girl scream!!]

If this is an early offering from a group of young film-makers, then I say give them some real money and let them bring us more, more, more...I know I'm going back and ordering a couple more copies to share.",1456272000,4,1498,4.858823529411764
7498088,5,B0179PIRQC,"""Sociopathia"" is a sordid love story that captured my attention immediately. Written, directed, & produced, by Ruby LaRocca & Rich Mallery, they bring devotion, obsession, & relationship's, to a whole new level of insanity. The cast includes a plethora of Scream Queens with Tammy Jean (Mara - the recluse & secretly sadistic lead character), Asta Paredes (Kat - Mara's latest conquest, who is as charming, as she is sexy & somewhat shy at times), Nicola Fiore, Nicolette Le Faye, Brandy Noir, who all in part make up part of Mara's ""doll"" collection.
The unraveling of Mara's pysche is as compelling, as it is jaunting at times. One may find themselves feeling sympathy & utter terror all at once for her. From the opening scene of sexuality & brutality, you know you're headed straight for a downward spiral of love, lust, & revenge. The intricately slow pace of the film only adds to the suspense. As a fan, collector, & supporter of the independent horror scene, I recommend this film as an addition to one's home library.",1456185600,6,1026,4.8352272727272725
7498089,5,B0179PIRQC,"Great movie with superb writing and directing behind it.  A new type of horror that I would be spoiling the fun if I went into plot details but just know great cast,  with great atmosphere and tension make this a must buy.  This creative team is going places.  Some people are just too narrow-minded to see.  Seriously though, pick up the movie and support the indie filmmakers that will become the future of the genre you love of horror and shock.",1456099200,4,448,4.481481481481482
