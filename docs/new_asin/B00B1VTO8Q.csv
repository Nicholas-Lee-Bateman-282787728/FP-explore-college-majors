8561132,1,B00B1VTO8Q,"This film was released in 2003 as Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires: The Curse of Ed Wood! It was dreadful then, simply re-titling it and re-packaging it is deceitful and, also sells as part of a larger collection ""Tomb of Terrors 50 Movie Pack"" - thus if you really really really have to buy this, get it as a pack, not a stand-alone film.

What is worse is that's it's already been repackaged as ""Lesbian Vampires"" (also available on amazon).

Check out the reviews for it under it's original name. If you haven't the time, then let me tell you that it sucks.

How many different ways does Amazon need to sell this rubbish?",1363392000,,621,4.477876106194691
8561133,1,B00B1VTO8Q,This is a re-released 2003 grade Z movie. Save your money. None of the actors have yet to get IMDB listings.,1362787200,,108,4.190476190476191
