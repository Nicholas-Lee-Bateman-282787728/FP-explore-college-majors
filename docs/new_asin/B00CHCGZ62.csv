5722217,5,B00CHCGZ62,"I really enjoy the breakdowns, the fast pace learning, and the ability to do this at home whenever I decide to. Zoe has a unique way of teaching and her style is fabulous. One of many favorite teachers/inspirations.",1400112000,2,215,4.684210526315789
5722218,5,B00CHCGZ62,"Amazing. First DVD is meant to be a ""beginner level"" but I find it quite advanced. Drills are really amazing, it will definitevly impove your technical skills. Advanced DVD (second one) I take later on, when I feel comfortable enough with the first one. I am intermediate dancer and I will repeat that beginners DVD nr 1 is not literally beginners level ;)
Also what I find very useful and extremely important that you'll find lots of travelling drills on this DVD set, which will make your mind more organized and clear while traveling around with other moves going on top ;)
This is one my number one DVDs",1395446400,5,607,4.577981651376147
5722219,2,B00CHCGZ62,"Maybe its me or my TV. But I want to drill like my life depends on it. But it is really difficult to watch this video. The quality of filming or that bright blue wall in the background gives me migraines. Its something about it I can only get to 20 minutes tops and then I just have to listen to what she is saying. It really really really sucks because its Zoe F'ing Jakes and she is somebody you don't want to just listen to. She is epic and I want to watch Everything she does. I would say if you know some sucker like me who bought this DVD, just barrow it, don't buy it.",1393286400,2,575,3.923076923076923
5722220,5,B00CHCGZ62,"I could follow her instruction, and unlike other dvd's I keep coming back to it so I can perfect my technique. It was challenging but not so hard to where I could not see improvement each day.",1390867200,3,192,4.216216216216216
5722221,5,B00CHCGZ62,"I want to start by saying I was the lucky winner of a contest given on the Cheeky Girls Productions Facebook page, the idea behind it was to encourage the winners to write an honest review for you lovely Amazon shoppers. :)
I wouldnt count this as a DVD for beginners. The marketplace is flooded with DVDs in all dance styles specifically for the beginner demographic, and the best ones, in my opinion, are from this company... That being said the nonstop style of this particular DVD isn't as condusive to a beginner who doesnt have a firm grasp of the movements before hand.
It is really refreshing that Cheeky Girls is making DVDs for those of us who have been training for many years.

To get to the point, this tribal style DVD is very unique. Zoey has a wonderful personality, I've been lucky enough to have taken workshops from her on three separate occasions, and her warmth and charm really comes through on camera.

As the previous the reviewer has stated the warm up is repeated on both discs, however this didn't bother me. I really appreciated the yoga sequences, I am chronically tense, and I feel like even though I don't do Yoga on the daily I was still able to do the moves and benefit from them.

I really liked the feel of this DVD, how she just explains while doing each move, but doesn't really stop the whole ""class"" to break it down and repeat it to death like happens on many other DVDs.
My favorite part of the DVD is how it is broken down into very distinct chapters, and you can choose to do the whole disc or go to the menu and pick the section that you feel like drilling. If you only have 15 minutes to get some drills in then this is a fantastic option. :)
The title really says it all, FLUID is the very definition of what a tribal dancer is hoping to achieve, IMO, and I think doing these kinds of drills at home are the best way to hone those skills. :)
I didn't actually do the advanced disc, just watched, as I am not that fluent in the ways of Tribal, but I love to switch it up for home practice, and this is not only a great dance practice session, but it's a phenomenal workout.

I will recommend this DVD to all of my dance class mates!",1381708800,15,2177,4.263922518159807
5722222,5,B00CHCGZ62,It is Zoe Jakes.  Need I say more.  I think it there is a ton of information in this set of DVDs.  I am a beginner so this is beyond my experience but It is a reference guide that I will use for a long time.  It is worth the money.,1378425600,3,231,3.4705882352941178
5722223,4,B00CHCGZ62,"So I will start this review by saying the I received mine as part of a contest hosted by the producer of this DVD. I will on the other hand be as honest as I can be. So to start out this review I have been doing Egyptian/Cabaret style belly dance for a year now and recently have started taking lessons in the tribal style. I have a strong dance background in other styles such as Ballroom dance and have begun taking yoga lessons regularly.

 So for tribal DVDs I will say that Zoe Jakes has the best on screen personality that I have encountered she seems friendly to the audience even though we aren't there. Which is really important, I have the Serpentine DVD and unfortunately the narrating in that DVD is much to monotone and impersonal for my taste making it hard to use for practice. That being said I feel like some parts of the DVD could be improved.

 The warm-up for both discs is the same, while I have no problem with that normally some of the moves that were covered are much too advanced to do without explanation. Much like other dance DVDs with a yoga section, the yoga itself is very questionable and unless you either have been doing yoga for awhile with an in-person instructor or have a very strong link with your bodies comfort zones you should just skip that section and maybe come back to it later. The warm-up could use with maybe another retake or someone watching to make sure that things are consistent between what she says and does. The best example I can remember is that when you are going from high plank to baby cobra she has inserted some push-ups, there is nothing wrong with that, but at first she states we are going to to three, but then proceeds to then say we are doing five and proceeds to do five. Also her flat back isn't really a flat back if you want to start getting technical. Otherwise it is actually a nice warm-up.

 Onto the the real meat of the DVD. It is an extremely well broken down explanation of Tribal style and in fact is almost comparable to the class I'm currently taking in person. The only real problems I found was again the mixed messages in what she says. She starts doing a regular snake arm she calls it a ""modified snake arm"" and than a few minutes later calls it a regular snake arm, and she doesn't really go over the correct posture in the beginning.

 The extras in the DVD are really fun to watch and are really enjoyable to see a glimpse into the production of the show they were producing and what it takes to be part of a choreography. I was extremely pleased with them and it made life a bit happier watching them. I haven't really done the more advanced disc because as I mentioned earlier in the review I have only recently started seriously studying Tribal style and I will edit this review once I get to a skill level where I can handle it.

Overall this is a great DVD if you actually want to see the Tribal style techniques broken down for you. Zoe Jakes is extremely friendly during these videos, the production values are really nice, and the extras are wonderful. I would just plan to have a different warm-up than the one featured on the DVD.",1378080000,14,3133,4.351027397260274
8581754,5,B00CHCGZ62,"Love her, love her teaching style, her warm up is great and the drills are working for me. Its packed with good information and if you practice it daily youll get better. Quickly.",1519430400,,179,4.454545454545454
8581755,5,B00CHCGZ62,"It's wonderful, it gives me a lot of ideas and high level drills,  if you continue practising them you can get the really fluid move. I love it! And I love the personality the Zoe shows in there, specially in the performance at the end of both DVDs",1480723200,,248,4.166666666666667
8581756,1,B00CHCGZ62,"DISAPPOINTED.

Zoe Jakes is a beautiful, precise dancer, however not so much a teacher.  If you are a beginner, I don't recommend this dvd.  You're better off saving your money by searching Tribal Fusion on YouTube.  Such as EHABY MELT who is an awesome teacher and her classes are free.  I have purchased several other tribal fusion instructional dvd's with different instructors.  I recommend Elisheva and Sera Soltice if you are wanting awesome teachers who are easy to follow.  Unless you are constantly looking at Zoe Jakes in this dvd, you have no clue what she is doing with her arms or body. Because she doesn't tell you everything she's doing.  It seems she teaches the techniques backwards as well. She is very hard to follow and I'm not a beginner.  Not worth the money.",1475884800,2,781,4.725925925925926
8581757,5,B00CHCGZ62,"Zoe Jakes is wonderful, quirky, and informative.
I am slowly working through this DVD as I learn (from local classes and other DVDs), and think I will be able to learn from this for a long time.
Not a primary teaching source (since it's drills) but a really, really good resource for drilling and improving established skills.",1473897600,2,326,4.7368421052631575
8581758,3,B00CHCGZ62,"Initial review of the first cd, just on looking through it: I am disappointed that about 23 minutes of the hour and 47 minutes are just random performances. I do like the artistic value that Jakes adds to her dances, because that is the way I dance. She also includes many techniques I've not seen in other videos that I have. However, I feel that she is not really great at locking and that much of her dance style is twirling and simple things that a person with no knowledge of belly dance could do. For example, if she locks her shoulder or arm it almost seems as if she includes the rest of her body in that lock, which is the opposite of what's supposed to be done. You see evidence of this at 1:29:44. Her arm locks look very lazy and never actually lock at all despite the crowd going wild.

Warmup: I hate yoga, and don't understand why all bellydance videos have it for warmup. That being said, I did it anyway. I noticed quickly that she moves too fast and by the time I get to the position she's suggesting she's already moved to something else. It is already not a beginner dvd because she uses chest circles, snake arms, and randomly inserts arm motions that are standard for her, but not for someone who hasn't seen them before. All this with no instruction on how to do them. What stretching there is, each move is literally less than 3 seconds, obviously not enough.

Arms: I give it a C. I do like that she shows some movements for hands alone.  Again, she will randomly throw in whole arm movements with it, but it's not too bad. Then she starts in with an arm movement to include the hand movements. This she starts out slow, then randomly starts skipping where she does the hand circles, which left me lost. She then progresses to doing a shimmy with it, which is not something she's shown yet, despite the fact it's supposed to be for beginners. Patterns of everything she's shown before follow this, but she doesn't warn what she's going to do or when. Is pent most of my time, again, trying to get to the thing she was doing and by the time I have a rhythm for it she's moved to something else. We're talking seconds of doing one thing then moving on. I spent too much time trying to figure out what she was doing to either enjoy it or learn anything.

Shimmy: So far, a D. Again, she immediately starts shimmying without explaining, again not for a beginner, and starts doing a different arm pattern with an added amount of foot work. No explanation, nothing. She then adds hip slides and circles with no instruction. There is where I stopped the dvd and decided to just do drills on my own. I was not getting a workout from this nor was I learning. Just pure frustration. I will finish my review when I finish the dvd.",1436745600,,2744,4.34307992202729
