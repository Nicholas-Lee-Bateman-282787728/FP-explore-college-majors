8553324,5,B00ALIOVU6,"I first saw this movie when it was first released in 1950 with my parents,  I was ten years old.  I became a big fan of the the stunningly beautiful YVONNE DE CARLO ! ,,,,,, and this movie has stuck in my mind ever since.  I have searched the Video stores and Amazon for many years to see if I could get it on Video Cassette or DVD  It's a really great 'Arabian Nights' story full of action and intrigue and is filmed in glorious 'Technicolor'.  I note the comments about this movie shown here,  however there is another DVD of 'THE DESERT HAWK', which I now have,  available through Amazon UK by 'SIMPLY MEDIA',  the picture and sound quality are excellent,  probably much better than when I first saw 'THE DESERT HAWK' at the Cinema in 1950 !  The 'SIMPLY MEDIA' DVD is also a Region 2,  If you are considering buying an All Region DVD player look no further than one with the name 'PHILIPS' on it  (also available through Amazon)  I have two 'PHILIPS' All Region DVD players they are both excellent machines.",1485129600,2,1011,4.370967741935484
8553325,2,B00ALIOVU6,"Advise against buying this fun Arabian Nights fantasy flick.

Despite being one of the best films in this early 1950s Technicolor Saturday matinee genre, it definitely needs some restoration (colors are faded and muddy).

Hopefully some day a properly restored version will be released on DVD at a reasonable price.

As noted by Amazon, this is a region two disc.",1411603200,6,363,5.016666666666667
