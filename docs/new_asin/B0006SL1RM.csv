i mean don't get me wrong the book this man wrote is good but when has anyone cared about where an author is from and what he does for  a living where he has traveled and why an author wrote a book i thought i was gonna learn something but nothing even if u haven't read any books on the subject matter u won't learn anything

and by the way this dvd is made on someones home computer they cant even cut covers out straight or afford photo paper

Pathetic

Garbage

rip off
