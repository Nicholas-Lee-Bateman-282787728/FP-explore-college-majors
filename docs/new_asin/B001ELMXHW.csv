8298713,5,B001ELMXHW,"After a serious accident, a man with his transfigured face decides to assume other identity. And because of this fact, a doctor makes for him a mask that allows him to walk between his fellow men without nothing to shame.

But the plot is very rich. And the ethical, existential and philosphical consequences derived from this decision will make its appearance, for better or worse.

To my mind, one of the supreme gems of the Japanese cinematography ever made. Teshigara is certainly one of my top of the list Japanese directors.

What a ride. Absolutely recommended. Don't miss it.",1352160000,,583,4.8686868686868685
8298714,4,B001ELMXHW,"Face of Another (Hiroshi Teshigahara, 1966)

Novelist Kobo Abe and director Hiroshi Teshigahara collaborated on four feature-length films during the sixties. Of the four, by far the most remembered today is Woman in the Dunes (which is also Abe's most remembered novel), their second collaboration, made in 1964 and a critical darling ever since (it appears on six of the eleven thousand-best lists I've collected over the years). The others, while they've faded into obscurity, are no less worth watching. The Face of Another was the third of the lot, released in 1966. It won a couple of awards for two more of Teshigahara's longtime collaborators, composer Tohru Takemitsu (who was with him right up until his last film, 1992's Go-hime) and art director Masao Yamazaki, who left the film business in 1968. But it was roundly ignored for acting and directorial awards (it was passed over entirely for the Best Foreign Film Oscar in the same year The Battle of Algiers didn't win it--there's still some egg on some faces from that, I think). Ah, well, hindsight is always 20/20.

Okuyama (Ran's Tatsuya Nakadai) is an office worker who was scarred in a fire. His doctor (The Mystery of Rampo's Mikijiro Hira) is working on a new, indistinguishable-from-the-real-thing skin substitute, and Okuyama, who as the film begins is always going around bandaged, agrees to be a guinea pig and wear a mask made out of the stuff. But Okuyama starts wondering...do I have to have a mask that looks like me? If I don't, can I become anonymous? Given such anonymity, what boundaries could I break down in the wider world?

Okuyama, of course, being a simple (and I use that term in more meanings than one) salaryman, doesn't think in such philosophical terms, but that's what his behavior amounts to. As a result, the film is an effective, sometimes chilling, examination of the meaning of identity. An existential thriller, if you will, quite along the same lines as John Frankenheimer's Seconds, released the same year (and, ironically, also almost ignored by the awards folks; it was nominated only for James Wong Howe's cinematography, losing to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?). As such, it becomes interesting to compare and contrast Okuyama with Rock Hudson's Tony Wilson; the two films would be a treat watched back-to-back. Seconds is the better of the two, but both are well worth it. *** ",1295395200,,2386,4.9575
8298715,3,B001ELMXHW,"Every so often one pops in a DVD into a player and gets a hell of a nice surprise via the images that start pouring out from the boob tube. Such was the case when I decided to watch a film of Hiroshi Teshigahara's, from a trilogy pack, released by The Criterion Collection, a few years ago. I had seen the collection at a good price, so bought it, knowing that some time in the future, when looking for a film to watch, I would come across the three disk set and be taken. Well, I was right. The film of his I chose as my initial foray was his third film, 1966's 124 minute long The Face Of Another (Tanin No Kao or '''',). It's a terrific film about reality, the self, ego, identity, duplication, and a few other classic themes in psychology, and one that just misses greatness because of a few minor flaws: a bit too show-offy and obvious in terms of its psychology and symbolism, a failed side story, and a few moments where the narrative fell into predictability. But, these flaws are only enough to keep it from flat-out greatness. Otherwise, the film is intelligent, well-written, well-acted, and brilliantly directed.

  The film was based on a novel of the same title by Kobo Abe. Abe and Teshigahara were partners on four films in the 1960s that were, to Japanese cinema, what the French New Wave was to European cinema. The film is a mlange of cinematic daring and brilliance, yet oddly contained in the older full frame aspect ratio and shot in black and white. This only emphasizes the innovation within the classic framework.",1283299200,,1538,4.505376344086022
