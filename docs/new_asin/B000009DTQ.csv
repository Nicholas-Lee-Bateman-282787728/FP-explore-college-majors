1197241,3,B000009DTQ,"The Criterion DVD (six W. C. Fields short subjects) has far better quality, but this streaming version is acceptable if not up to the same level of quality.",1375056000,,156,4.607142857142857
1197242,2,B000009DTQ,"It's nice to add this classic to my collection of golf movies but was disapointed somewhat in this one.

I wasn't expecting anything elaborate, knowing the era it was from, but I was expecting more than a two scene play that reminded me of something a 5 year old might have made up. I'm a big fan of W.C Fields but this was not one of his high points of production or writing.

I would not have bought it had I seen it before my purchase.",1250726400,,438,4.0813953488372094
1197243,5,B000009DTQ,"Extraordinary dry wit from the master.  The Dentist and The Golf Specialist are great slapstick, must viewing for comedy lovers.  The Fatal Glass of Beer is something a little different, however: a satirical morality play, at the climax of which Fields--one of entertainment's great drinkers--performs a droll and tuneless song about the perils of drink.  There are few broad laughs in this short, the plot of which has something to do with the Yukon Gold Rush, but Fields here may have striven more to puzzle than to amuse.",976665600,7,524,4.931818181818182

1197258,4,B000009DTQ,Interesting W.C. Fields short. We get to see him show off some of his juggling prowess as well as his biting sarcasm and superior attitude. You can see how his later film persona was just a continuation of these characters.,1424390400,,223,4.6

1197263,1,B000009DTQ,"I thought this would be funny. I wanted it to be funny. But it was just stupid. I like many older moves from the late 40's and 50's, but I couldn't relate to this comedy at all.",1384387200,,177,3.810810810810811
