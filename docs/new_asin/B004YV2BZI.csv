The v/o (voice over) does a good job of keeping up with the film as does the added sound which was not part of Frank Pfuhler's original movies. The Milwaukee streetcar footage at the end of the DVD is a wonderful bonus and brought back my memories of riding the Wells Streetcar line in the last years of operation. I highly recommend this DVD to all North Shore and TMER&L fans.",1428192000,,544,4.494949494949495

8448865,5,B004YV2BZI,"Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, I was never able to get to ride the line when it was still running.  I have always regretted that fact, but now, thanks to this CD, I have had a chance to get an idea of what it must have been like to ride it.  I did get to see one of the Electroliners when I rode the Norristown line, as well as the one in the trolley museum in Orbisonia.  Still, as a railfan, I felt that I should have seen them on their home iron, and not somewhere else.  This DVD lets you see the old cars in action, as well as the varied paint schemes employed by the CNS&M.  Too, I had always wondered what the Milwaukee terminal looked like, trackage wise, and this disk had it right there in plain sight.  It's a great disk for anyone who's interested in the old, high Speed transit that was the interurban.",1360627200,,829,4.182389937106918
