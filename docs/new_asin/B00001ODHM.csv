7914543,4,B00001ODHM,"Vol. 1: In Quest Of: Ancient Aliens -3 out of 5 stars -

 This is just a rehash of ""Chariot of The Gods"" film by Erich Von Daniken. Most of the same footage but they use a different narrator. It might be a bit updated but I didn't bother watching the whole thing. If you don't own ""Chariot of The Gods"" or never seen it, I guess your in luck if you buy this.

 Vol. 2: Aliens and Man: Where Do We Come From? -4 out of 5 stars -

 This one was done well except for all the old footage.

 I was disappointed due to the fact this set was made in the Late 90s. This film deals with the theory of Aliens creating mankind. If you want to know more of this theory I recommend the book ""The 12th Planet"" by Zecharia Sitchin.

 Vol. 3: Man Vs. Nature: Who Will Win? -5 out of 5 stars -

 This one is worth the $20. Very well done with top secret footage shown for the first time of an atomic energy accident. This one is very educational, and will depress you. It is very sad what man has done to his mother earth.

 Vol. 4: Ancient Prophesies -4 out of 5 stars -

 Once again, very old footage (all of them have old footage). Hosted by Orson Welles. This mostly deals with the prophecies of the bible, and makes the connection of a war against Israel as the battle of Armageddon.",1091836800,13,1271,4.00398406374502

7914545,5,B00001ODHM,"well done, has all the elements lot of history, religios studies . Explore all the possibilities and provides stuning visual proof that some form of  life fron auter space landed on Earth centuries ago , takes the viewer into  the far reaches the underground caves and tombs and you go to every major  continent . I enjoyedd very much . this series is for all ages of people  and every  it will be show in every school in the country
