4494418,5,B004XC5LQE,"Finally wrapped my head around all the in-fighting and back biting, and heard the best reply to all these bone heads who think Richard III was a misunderstood nice guy. Why did so many nobles ""Suddenly"" support this ""nobody twice removed"" if Richard hadn't done something they just couldn't deal with.",1360713600,10,301,4.921568627450981
4494419,2,B004XC5LQE,"I really love this period od English history. So, I was very excited when my husband got me this for Christmas...However, I am slightly dissapointed.

Pro:
It is detailed and accurate.
The Visuals are really good.

Cons:
The narrator isn't good.
The music over takes he audio and it makes it hard to hear the narration.

I kept having to pause and explain things to my husband (who is unfamiliar with the middle ages). I was hoping to enjoy this more.
Its not the worst but certainly not the best documentary I have seen.",1359763200,15,521,4.5212765957446805

4494422,5,B004XC5LQE,"New archaeological evidence, and extensive historical research, are featured in this thoughtful examination of the series of battles that consist of the Wars of the Roses. The specials on weaponry, combat techniques, forensics, and the archeological site of Bosworth Field are all well worth watching. You may want to turn on the subtitles; at times, the music overwhelms the narrative. The role of ""The Kingmaker,"" Richard de Neville, Earl of Warwick, is explored: this powerful force of the House of York was centered at his Warwick Castle, pitted against the House of Lancaster and the weak Henry VI. After the devastating Battle of Wakefield (December 1460) Neville's father, the Earl of Salisbury, was killed, beheaded at the direction of Queen Margaret (while Henry VI was having another bout of mental issues). The Earl's son (and Kingmaker's brother) Sir Thomas Neville was killed in battle. Queen Margaret kept the Plantagenet rivalries going, family feuds gone viral; all were related to one another. Richard's brother, John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu, was later killed at another decisive Roses clash, the Battle of Barnett, April 1471; the family lines continued despite all this. No one mentions that one of the The Kingmaker's daughters was Queen Anne (married to Richard III), while her sister Isabel married a great-grandson of Edward III's, George Plantagenet, the Duke of Clarence.

It would have been interesting if the backstory had examined how the powerful Plantagenet, Neville, and Percy (Duke of Buckingham, later Earl of Northumberland), and Beaufort families were all interrelated, with Scottish, Saxon, and various other lineages. This only makes the Wars of the Roses more perplexing. It isn't mentioned that Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, was the grandson of John of Gaunt, a son of Edward the III, King of England. Another of John of Gaunt's daughters was the grandmother of King Henry the VIII. I know those who, oddly enough, happen to be directly descended from pivotal figures involved in the Wars of the Roses; it's a long story from these conflicts to those who became American colonists who fought in the Revolutionary War. Anyway, if you enjoy studying history, I highly recommend this excellent, well-researched, and entertaining film.

4494447,4,B004XC5LQE,"They tended to leave out some major points on several levels,  One, that Edward's being illegitimate and a bigamist dogged his entire reign, and one of the reasons Richard was able to claim the crown. That promoting those reasons, and claiming Elizabeth Woodville was a witch, is why George, Duke of Clarence, was executed.  In fact, recently, documents surfaced that proved that Edward most likely was illegitimate and not entitled to reign,  Second, the HUGE role Margret Beaufort played behind the scenes, scheming.  Third, the fact the Duke of Buckingham might very well have been the one to murder the Princes in the Tower, as it wasn't long after they disappeared, he raised a rebellion against Richard and as Marshall, had access to the Tower.  Third, that if Elizabeth Woodville thought Richard murdered her sons, why did she allow her princesses to return to court under the guardianship of Richard, and she did so willingly.  Fourth, that many of the Northern Lords turned from Richard after his wife, Anne Neville, died and he was rumored to want to marry Princess Elizabeth - Edward's daughter and his own niece. So, at best, this documentary left a huge portion of the political climate and intrigue unexplored.",1474675200,3,1224,4.9754901960784315

Best seen after some study/reading of the time period and/or reading Phillipa Gregory's Cousin's War series (This series gets a solid ""10"" rating to me) to solidify the names/places/time sequence of this non-fiction video.  It is not 100% up to date on the developments following the  finding of Richard III's skull and what other ""finds"" came shortly thereafter, but a good springboard for future study and/or preceding historical travel to the UK - although many places are not, in actuality, very well marked today.",1440806400,2,727,5.135593220338983

4494486,4,B004XC5LQE,"This video looks at the period of strife and conflict which came about during the reign of Henry VI. Henry turned out to be an extremely weak leader, and as a result cliques formed among his retinue. Catastrophic decisons (or non-decisions) would eventually lead to outright military conflict, especially as Henry IV had a bad habit of going catatonic for long periods of time. Richard of York upheld the Plantagenet line against the Lancasters and when he was succeeded by his son Edward the Plantagenets would eventually placew themselves on the throne. But wait, there's more! Edward's brother the Duke of Clarence, dies in the Tower, probably due more to his silly habit of changing sides during the Civil War than any conspiracy involving his brother, the Duke of Glouster. Then when Edward dies Glouster becomes Richard III, eliminates Edward's legitimate successors and is in turn overthrown by Henry Tudor, thus ending the Wars of the Roses.

This series is well done, features some interesting characters who are deeply interested in particular aspects of this period and even features a couple of guys demonstrating how men fought in those days. A really good documentary!",1417564800,,1182,5.092783505154639

4494493,3,B004XC5LQE,"I recommend this program to someone who is already somewhat familiar with the Wars of the Roses and would like to learn more. (Examples of why it would be confusing to a newcomer to the material:  Due to some strange editing, when they first mention the Earl of March they don't bother to state that the Earl of March is Edward Plantagenet, son of Richard, Duke of York, that same Edward who will go on to become Edward IV.  They also don't mention Anne Neville, who goes on to become Queen of England during Richard III's reign, but they do refer to Isabella Neville, her sister, as the Earl of Warwick's ""other daughter"" so apparently Anne was mentioned and edited out.) The first half of the DVD is the most interesting.  I learned quite a bit about the family rivalry between the Percies and the Nevilles and how that helped to that lead to the start of the Wars of the Roses, and the fact that through their skirmishes the ""war"" had actually started before it became a struggle for the crown.  This is information you don't often get in programs about the Wars of the Roses.  I liked that they emphasized Queen Margaret's aggressive involvement in the machinations of government at the time, rather than minimizing her role as is often done to female historical figures. I also appreciated their not reducing Henry VI to the stereotypical crazy, sweet saint, and were willing to discuss his personal flaws as well as his virtues.

As the program progresses, the quality goes downhill a bit.  It was inexplicably biased toward the Yorks and against the Lancastrians, in that they mention the atrocities committed by Lancastrian forces and not the York forces. Another big flaw is the short shrift they give to Richard III.  His role in the Wars as a young man is barely mentioned, and his loyalty to his brother (such a fascinating contrast with his later seizure of the throne) not mentioned at all, and the brief account of his reign is solidly in the ""Richard killed the Princes"" camp without giving the viewer any notion of Richard being the contradictory, complex person he was. Not that I am saying they should have taken the Ricardian point of view; but to portray such a famous king as something other than two-dimensional would have made for a more interesting piece of historical storytelling.  (This in contrast with their more successful and nuanced discussion of Henry VI.) I also wasn't too impressed with their dismissal of Richard's brother George, Duke of Clarence as ""stupid"", an awfully simplistic conclusion considering that a chronicler praised both George and Richard as having been brilliant, intellectual able young men.

If you're interested in details of the battles and in tutorials regarding fighting techniques of this period, you will enjoy this DVD; I skipped through most of this material, but I was intrigued by the forensic evidence they provided of the exceptional brutality of the Battle of Townton, presenting evidence by way of trashed skulls, how the blows struck went beyond what was necessary to end life.

To sum up, I recommend this DVD for its excellent background on the early phases of the Wars of the Roses.",1403827200,52,3158,4.808118081180812

There are several historians who explain the intricate details of the wars in a very easy to understand way. You also get to watch two guys dressed in suits of armor demonstrating medieval weapons and war technique, which I found quite interesting. The only thing that drove me crazy about this documentary was the black and white ""war"" footage. Clearly the filmmakers were going for the whole ""you are there"" experience, trying to make the battle scenes look like actual footage from the Wars of the Roses! Instead, the grainy, blurry scenes were just annoying and distracting to me.

Overall, I recommend you purchase this film for educational and informative benefit.",1390521600,15,565,4.707070707070707

4494505,4,B004XC5LQE,It is more of an audible story than a video.  It did not hold my interest all the time.  I like listening to it.,1382400000,4,112,3.625
4494506,3,B004XC5LQE,Just ok. Poor production values but informative and interesting. History channel should upgrade the dvd to be on par with their more modern ones.,1382227200,2,145,5.083333333333333
4494507,3,B004XC5LQE,The war of the roses was a very informative documentory. I gained a much better understanding of the conflict between the houses of york & Lancaster as a result of viewing this program.,1381449600,2,185,4.636363636363637
4494508,5,B004XC5LQE,great show for my I enjoy hard and entretainig to . but should play on Spanish also  for more audices,1381104000,2,101,4.05

4494510,5,B004XC5LQE,This is an excellent way to either refresh your knowledge or supplement it with more detail of this period in English history.  I watched this after completing a DVD take home course on Medieval England taught by Jennifer Paxton.,1372204800,14,229,4.871794871794871
4494511,5,B004XC5LQE,VERY SPECIFIC AS TO THE ORIGIN AND CONTINUED STRIFE CAUSED BY THE CONFLICT. IF YOU LOVE HISTORY YOU WILL LOVE THIS.,1371168000,,115,4.523809523809524
4494512,3,B004XC5LQE,It's not the best documentary on this episode in history because it did not include enough points of view. This is a very disputed time in history and there are many opinions on every side that would have been good to examine.,1367625600,2,226,4.404761904761905
4494513,3,B004XC5LQE,"At the 6:30 mark, the narrator claims that Henry V ""was to achieve the dynastic ambitions of his great-grandfather, Edward II, and add the crown of France to that of England.""

This is incorrect.  Henry V's great-grandfather was Edward III, not Edward II.  Edward III started the Hundred Years' War in an effort to claim the French throne, not Edward II.

Apparently the makers of this film didn't bother to watch it themselves before they released it.  Who knows what other errors the film contains.",1364688000,5,500,4.8352941176470585

8446725,5,B004XC5LQE,"This is how to make historical documentaries. Covers details, personalities, intrigues, combat and holds your attention from start to finish. While giving you all the pertinent information about what caused these seemingly endless wars, you also get an understanding of how all this impacted the individual soldier. This is so much better than anything on the history channel and surpasses much that the BBC has made as well. An excellent history lesson brought to life. I hope they don't stop with this one.",1519603200,4,508,5.132530120481928

8446727,5,B004XC5LQE,Simply one of the best documentaries Ive seen in a long time. Loved the reenactors sprinkled in to give a visual picture of 15th century warfare. The historians were good at explaining what was really going on and why characters may have behaved as they did. Wish there were more like this.,1518048000,,290,4.596153846153846
8446728,5,B004XC5LQE,"This is an excellent history of the War of the Roses, with all of the posturing behind the scenes, and all the warts of its infamous players.  It packs a lot into a short time, and could get confusing, but then again, this whole dynastic war is confusing of itself.",1517097600,,265,4.3
8446729,5,B004XC5LQE,"These discs are from one of the great productions from the 1960s (I believe) of Shakespeare's Henry VI and Richard III plays of the dynastic war that tore apart England, resulting in the fall of the Plantagenet dynasty that had ruled England since Henry II, and from which the Tutor dynasty arose in Henry VII, the father of Henry VIII.

But this production, which I saw when I was much younger, was an eye opening effort to bring the ""difficult"" Henry VI plays to contemporary audience.

Since then there have been other efforts several worth seeing.  This was the break through",1516233600,3,579,4.712871287128713
