This would appear to be a Showtime cable pay-per-view broadcast from the Cow Palace near San Francisco in 1986.  The show was also simulcast on KLOS-FM out of Los Angeles, and that broadcast can be found here under  'Legendary FM Broadcasts - The Cow Palace, Daly City CA 21st November 1986' as a CD.  The recording is also available in the UK under the listing 'Cow Palace 1986 (2CD)'.

There seems to be some legal loopholes regarding European law where broadcasts such as this can be legally marketed.  I'm a little surprised to see this particular recording on the shelf since it originated as a cable broadcast, not an over-the-air production.  Perhaps since the FM simulcast is being marketed there are 'extenuating circumstances', but you would think someone would want to protect the rights to the visual component.

Obviously the audio and video is professionally produced, although I doubt anyone can account for what generation the item is mastered from. The performance is bold and the sound is stunning.  The setlist is from one of the weaker period in Young's career as the music stylings of the era veered far from Neil's trademark folk/psychedelic/hard rock motif.  Neil composed few tracks during this period that were retained as mainstays in his subsequent tours.  Despite that truth, there is no reason why even casual fans of Neil wouldn't enjoy seeing how tracks like 'Too Lonely', 'Opera Star', and even the 'Trans' offerings such as 'Computer Age' were tendered on-stage.",1495324800,,1974,4.742690058479532
8725538,4,B0127ID9CS,This video contains strong scenes of good Rock'n Roll music. It is recommended not only for Young fans but also for the older ones. And I felt like getting high... FERA CASTRO.,1388620800,,176,4.53125
8725539,3,B0127ID9CS,Neil Young a tapestry is one of the best r&r dvds i have ever seen. Unfortunately the sound & picture quality is poor. This i can not understand as the music in review dvd that comes with it has much of the same footage but is of much higher quality & in 5.1 surround. Go figure!!! This would be a big seller if remastered! Someone please grab this gem & give it the attention it deserves!,1323561600,6,389,4.131578947368421
