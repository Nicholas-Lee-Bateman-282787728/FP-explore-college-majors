8721223,5,B010178OOU,"Anyone and everyone should watch this movie. It is PROFOUND! Whether you are a lactivist like me or a proud bottlefeeder, you can appreciate the disservice that big business has done to humans.  The way we have allowed formula companies and medical institutions to change our feelings on health, birth and motherhood is sickening. I am not arguing breast vs bottle, but I am saying that anyone could benefit from learning how marketing, advertising and professions can influence a whole world. Just watch it. Learn to trust in your bodies and not believe the hype.",1496188800,,564,4.936842105263158

8721227,5,B010178OOU,"This is an amazing movie. I watched on Netflix and highly recommend to anyone expecting a child or grand baby. Discussing how we became a society of very little breastfeeding mothers, the benifits of bf, how to support bf moms, and how in other countries bf is the norm. It's very touching to her other moms struggles and reasons why they stopped breastfeeding.",1455926400,3,361,4.746031746031746
8721228,5,B010178OOU,"This review is not based on content but the production quality of the disc manufacture.  The disc does not read in my Oppo-93 Blu-ray Player giving an unknown disc error.  The disc appears to be burn on demand based on examining the read side of the platter.

Update of my review of this product...  A new disc was sent and it worked without an issue with the Oppo-93... I love this documentary.",1453075200,2,395,4.444444444444445
8721229,5,B010178OOU,Loved this movie so much after watching it today at a breastfeeding support group. I am going to purchase it. The statistics are incredible and after watching it and it reaffirmed that I am doing all the right things. I do hope this promotes further education/development in new mothers that are not exposed to these natural practices.,1445644800,4,335,4.894736842105263
