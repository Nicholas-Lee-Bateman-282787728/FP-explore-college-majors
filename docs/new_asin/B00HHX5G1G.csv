8632837,4,B00HHX5G1G,"Just finished watching all twelve episodes.  I liked the series, and hopefully there will be more as episode 12 ends oddly, and leaves things hanging in mid stream.  As the light novel appears to be still ongoing, hopefully there will be more anime to follow.  As far as the Blu-ray and DVD shown here for sale, I am extremely skeptical of their authenticity, as the last episode just aired in Japan on 27 Mar 14.  In addition, the studio is identified here as ""Import,"" yet the studio for the anime is actually ""Madhouse,"" licensed by ""Sentai Filmworks.""  Further the discs are identified as being ""All Regions,"" which means it is probably a bootleg from China.  We all know how China likes to make illegal copies of everything they can get their hands on.  I think I will wait for a legitimate copy to be put out on the market, as I believe in supporting the industry and don't care to violate copyright laws, nor do I care for those who violate the laws.",1396569600,2,957,4.497109826589595
8632838,2,B00HHX5G1G,"First off, this anime is really good first 6 episodes.  The problem is that this 12 episode anime expands over 7 light novels so the actual anime is so condensed it doesn't really flow well.  Usually a 12 episode series is based off 1-2 give or take 3 light novels MAX because the story won't flow right.  The last 3 episodes were done so bad that you are literally sitting there confused and wondering why I wasted 12 weeks of time watching this. But most of you guys will think that there will be a second season, but you're wrong. The Author who wrote the light novels even said it was a bad idea to do this anime and there will be no more light novels so the ending will be how it ends. Also the $120+ price is absolutely overpriced for an anime that didn't get very good reviews.",1396483200,4,784,4.213333333333333
