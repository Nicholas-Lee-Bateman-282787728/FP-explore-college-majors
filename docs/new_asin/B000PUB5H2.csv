8193363,4,B000PUB5H2,"No Me Defiendas Compadre is one of the better films starring Tin Tan(German Valdes). In this film, he plays an ex-con who struggles to hold a decent job and provide for his romantic interest(played by Rosita Quintana). The scene in the restaurant is so funny, it'll split your sides! It's amazing that Mexican people criticized Tin Tan for mixing English and Pachuco slang in his vocabulary!

""Me cae bien esto Superman! Hello, honey, you wanna dance under the moonlight? ?Que paso?""

This film would be a good place to start if one is unfamiliar with Tin Tan's films.",1237075200,2,568,4.785714285714286
