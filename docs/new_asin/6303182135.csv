589921,4,6303182135,"This workout was done way back in 1987 and it looks like it. The music is really bad and the clothing is even worse. I think that there was a guy with jheri curls in there! Anyway, even though the video is dated, the workout is excellent. Beginners probably will have a hard time completing the video, but it gets a bit easier when you do it on a consistent basis. I could not even lift my legs the first time that I did this workout. Nowadays, the workout is still very intense, but it is not as intense as the first time that I did it.",978307200,39,537,4.02803738317757
589922,5,6303182135,"This is the best video I've ever used.  The moves are easy to follow, but they certainly don't feel easy.  If you want a simple but effective workout, look no further than the original Buns of Steel.  Yes, it was made in 1987 and the clothes are terrible.  Who cares?  This doesn't affect your workout, and in my opinion it adds to the fun!  Others have complained about the music, but the beats really help you keep up the pace.  Greg Smithey is a wonderful instructor -- he explains the moves well and adds a touch of humor.  If you want fast results, buy this video and do it a few times a week.  Don't feel discouraged if you can't do all of the reps right away.  Just do what you can and it will get easier.",969926400,39,712,4.131386861313868

589924,4,6303182135,"I began using buns of steel about a year and a half ago, encouraged by my then roomate who was a B.O.S finatic.  At first it was so hard and I felt like I was extremely out of shape.  But, within months my roomate and I  added 5lb. leg weights and used them through out the whole video.  We both  had a great time with it and found it hilarious to name all the characters  (the russian dancer, the 70's clown, and Chuck Norris).  I have moved out  and live 3000 miles away.  So, after trying to stay steady with a gym  membership, I am ordering my very own copy of B.O.S",945216000,14,570,4.008928571428571
589925,4,6303182135,"This video had too many people on the set, an old set and bad music. But the excercises are the best I've tried. I can't even do the whole workout. If you can get past the cons and a very feminine instrutor, you can get a  great workout. The warm up and cool down are the longest and best I've  seen. Within a week I felt and saw a difference. There are newer tapes but  I feel the excercises on this tape are most effective.",944006400,20,425,3.976470588235294

590053,5,6303182135,"I absolutely LOVE this workout. Forget squats and deadlifts, this workout is the real deal. I'm a writer so I sit quite a bit and I noticed that my butt was becoming flatter. I started doing Greg's butt targeting workout only (I don't do the inner thigh workout because I have naturally slender thighs to begin with). I've been doing the workout 5x per week for about 7 weeks now and my butt is bigger and rounder!  My clothes fit differently, my dresses are more flattering back there, it's fantastic. 5x per week may be too much for some people, but I have a tendency to waiver toward the extreme. Taking only two rest days hasn't hindered my progress whatsoever. I should add that I've upped my water and protein intake, especially right after these sessions to aid in muscle building/repair and it has worked like a charm. This booty has never looked better. Since I'm so familiar with the moves now, I don't always watch the video, but I'll do the entire routine on my own with more reps. It still burns like hell, but I've gained lots of strength so I can add more and more reps to each move or multiple sets of the entire routine (usually 2-3). If you're new to the workout, make sure that you stay true to Greg's form, that's gonna get you there a lot faster. I'll notice that right after the workout my buns will swell a bit, so doing it right before putting on your favorite pants or dress can give you an extra pop. Highly recommended!!",1489708800,2,1447,4.419475655430712

I used to be quite athletic but without doing this workout my thighs didn't get slim. The instructor is funny and the workout works! This - I'd say do it every other day if you are in your 20s, along with any other exercise you like. If you are in your late 50's like me - do it when you can but add more stretching as well. I know there are other Buns of Steel tapes but they (for me) do a lot more muscle building rather than tightening, smoothing, and decreasing size -- I really missed this workout when my VHS tape wore out.",1484956800,5,684,3.9280575539568345

I've been using this vhs since it came out and it is my ""go to"" video, but got scared when my old vcr stopped playing my vhs that was already getting so worn and shaky on tv.  This is the ONLY video my husband is willing to do b/c it's simple enough to follow along with and non threatening.  The video requires no extra equipment which is great, only a little floor space.  The 80's theme in clothes and music is nostalgic.  I think what I like best is that at no point goes Greg make me feel bad about myself, he's inspiring in an unassuming way.  And I don't have to stare at half naked unattainable bodies to discourage me before I even start.  And this video REALLY works.  You can tell while you're doing it too.  It says ""buns"" of steel, but it could really just be ""body"" of steel.  I've tried a lot of different programs and this one tops them all.",1484524800,11,908,4.137142857142857

I lost the vhs somewhere along the way and ended up buying 2 more just in case I lost one again.  Then I sold my vhs player in a yard sale and had no way to play the darn vhs x 2 LOL anyway last night for some reason this vhs popped into my head and I was thinking about buying another vhs player at walmart even though the one I sold worked perfectly.  I looked it up online and found it in DVD format!  Imagine my excitement at finding the Famous Buns of Steel with Greg Smithey on DVD!!  No joke here, if you are looking for a lower body workout that just plain works!  This is it, search no further.  Yes it will kick your butt and lift it at the same time, it'll make your hips and thighs burn like you never thought possible but it when it is said and done people are going to notice.  Do this workout at least 3 or 4 days a week alternating a good upper body work out (which I have not found if anyone knows of a good upper body please let me know) I promise you will be Bikini ready by next summer!  We are moving to a lake and I have got 60 pounds of belly fat to get rid of!  Greg Smithey and I are going to be best buds this fall and winter!

I had never heard about him , yes I'm quite young, I wasn't even born in the 80s, but I know famous fitness instructors like Gilad, Tamilee Webb and Jane Fonda. I've tried many, many workouts before, and this was kind of hard...I began the workout with ankle weights believing this would be easy, but once the warm up was done and the floor work started I was in alot of pain, it was really hard to lift my leg over and over again in all directions, you don't get rest. So I took the ankle weights off and it still was hard. Really, you can do this without weights and still get results. You feel it exactly where he tells you should be feeling something. And once you're done your legs feel weak, but I believe that is a good sign as it means I worked enough.
I am average weight, but I though about toning my legs (my problem area as it is where I tend to gain weight, have cellulite, etc). It is worth trying.",1454457600,2,953,4.184782608695652

This workout is excellent for targeting the hips, gluteal muscles, and inner thighs.  And it helps strengthen knees.  My friend recently was informed by her doctor that she needed to strengthen her knees by strengthening her gluteal and core muscles.  I recommended she try this workout and she has found it to lessen the pain in her knees and strengthen her hip muscles.

590386,5,6303182135,"For some reason, must workout videos targeting the thighs and butt tend to have you lunge a  lot. As a former gymnast, any repetitive lunging makes my upper thighs huge. It simply builds up the targeted areas instead of slimming. The original Buns of Steel workout is fantastic for me because it's nearly all floorwork, which seems to slim and lengthen the muscles as opposed to building bulk. I've used this video on and off for the past 16 years. I can honestly say that this is the only workout I've ever done where my butt looks better almost immediately. I can definitely tell when I use it, and when I take a break. Most certainly, the fashions are 80s-delux with lycra for days, as are the hairstyles. Even though I've now heard Greg Smithey say the same encouraging phrases so often that I can quote them line by line, I enjoy his calm and positive demeanor way more than a lot of the high intensity workout trainers. If you don't like to feel as if you're being shouted at while you work out, then Greg Smithey is just what you need. Also, and this is just a personal choice, but I enjoy the less than perfectly toned 1980s physiques way more than watching highly tanned borderline-bathing suit models jump around. It's better for the self-esteem. Overall, I would highly recommend this workout video. As Greg Smithey would say, buy this dvd is you want beautiful buns, buns of steel!",1401235200,8,1393,4.572

I have tried Tracy Anderson method which really made me slimmer (down 1-2 sizes) however it didn't really changed the shape of my body. So after a research I came through this workout and it was a revelation. It's not an average cardio but it has a fast pace that will keep your heart rate high. You never jump around (warming up is really beginners friendly no matter how much you weight). You'll soon feel your high hip- side bun area burn because I think it really targets problem areas, without stressing your knees. Greg is fun and motivating, he knows what he does but he doesn't act as if he is the ""expert"". I've loved his cueing and the 80's style. Also I've loved that (contrary to modern trainers)in his site he informs that following his workout 3 times a week is enough to see the change.

590423,5,6303182135,"I own a lot of exercise videos, in VHS and DVD formats, and I perhaps utilize them in a way that not everyone does -- I initially watch them to simply see whether there is anything -- and even if it's one exercise, idea, technique, sequencing, or piece of advice -- that is different or otherwise useful in a way that appeals to me, and subsequently expands my 'repertoire', or results in my modifying (or replacing) an existing method, etc. -- if even one such thing is associated with my viewing a given video, then I consider it to have been of benefit.

Not surprisingly, many videos involve exercises that are common to many other videos, and thus for some fitness videos, I might see nothing that truly stands out or is in any way different from what I've seen elsewhere.

Additionally, I do not subscribe to the thinking that seems prevalent in many realms, and involves 'newer' somehow being equated with 'better' -- I'm aware that there are many 'oldies but goodies', and can look past the associated (and usually not-so-appealing) music, outfits, and era-specific hairstyles -- it doesn't affect my motivation, and the importance of the 'what' and 'how' contained within trump any seemingly 'cosmetic' aspects.

I'd heard of the 'Buns of Steel' video many years ago, and found myself curious as to why it had become famous -- and especially wondered whether its popularity was due to anything special or otherwise unique about the production.  Well, not long into viewing a VHS version of the original 'Buns of Steel', I definitely took notice -- this was not anything like the various forms of fluff I'd seen in miscellaneous 1980s fitness videos -- no, ""The Original Buns of Steel"" production (specifically, and with Greg Smithey -- I'm not referring to later variants of the series) can and does still 'hold its own', exercise quality-wise, when compared to so many other fitness videos.

In viewing this the first time, I was also surprised by how it wasn't just one, or even 'just a few' things that I took note of, and could tell would be effective in 'working' the relevant region (and in a way that was friendly to my knees) -- the whole darn production stands out -- it was one 'yes' after another, when it came to my flagging the different exercises for my use... I was and am impressed -- the exercises utilized in this video are still embraced by many today because they work, and I haven't found (and don't expect to find) a true 'replacement' video for this 'routine' (that being said, aspects of some of the exercises would now be considered more representative of certain 'specialties' within the fitness genre (with some Lotte Berk, Bar Method, and Ballet Beautiful -esque aspects found in the video -- which, to an extent, could potentially be interpreted as this video having been somewhat 'ahead of its time'...though all in all, it is simply a terrific combination of well-chosen and effective exercises, and ones which were selected for targetting development of a specific region of the body).

If I had to choose from among my (many) exercise videos, and create a kind of Top Ten list, this video would be among them -- I don't care about the 'when' of its creation, as it's the quality of exercise selection (and associated effectiveness), and the overall usefulness value, that matter most to me.",1378857600,7,3332,4.786086956521739
590424,5,6303182135,"I just recently dusted off my VHS copy of The Original Buns of Steel with Greg Smithey. It had been sitting on my shelf for nearly 20 years, after I had received it as a birthday gift when I was 15 or 16 years old.

Let me tell you, I must have put it to the side because it is a TOUGH workout! When I returned to it 2 weeks ago, I easily made it through the warm-up and upper body exercises, but struggled at times to complete the 30 minute leg workout (all done on the floor). The mat work you see is very old-school, yet I never felt as though the moves were out-dated. Even though my lower body is strong, I can definitely see that my hips and buns are looking firmer (I have done the workout 2-3x/week, along with cardio 3-4x/week.) After the intense bun workout, the video finishes with a short ab workout and then cooldown.

I recall thinking that Mr. Smithey was a little ""creepy"" back in the day (hey I was 15!) with all his bun comments, but now realize he is just a bun enthusiast! I enjoy his instruction, the shiny leotards, perms, etc., even though the outdated look and music may not sit well with some.

Note: Mr. Smithey has a Bachelors of Arts in Physical Education and Masters in Education. His knowledge definitely shines with his instruction during this video!

PROS:
* No major equipment is needed...just a mat or towel on a hard floor
* Exercises really work to slim the hips, thighs, and buns!

CONS:
* None that I can think of",1376265600,6,1451,4.281021897810219
590445,5,6303182135,"I bought the DVD a few months ago, but didn't look at it until today because I know the pain it will cause. You see, I used the videotape version over 10 years ago, and it got me into shape. It was hard though because at first I couldn't get through all of the leg exercises. But eventually I was able to finish them, and, boy, did I have it going on! My legs looked sculpted, my thighs had  that ""inner gap"" that's all the rage now, and, of course, my backside was magnificent -- high, round, and tight. So, what happened? I stopped excercising, and eventually my body got soft. My butt flattened, my inner gap disappeared, and my legs started developing cellulite. But the effects (and good genes, I suppose) lasted more than five years.

Since I passed one of those milestone birthdays almost two years ago, I've been thinking about trying to get back into shape one last time. We don't have a VCR anymore so I had to track down a DVD version (and did so for a lot cheaper on the official website). So today I finally turned on the DVD, and there was Greg and the gang in all of their spandexy, 80s-hair glory, as well as the corny music you usually hear in a B movie. I didn't mind though because I know what's coming. I only did the warm-up and just a little of the arm toning, and will probably repeat these two more times this week before starting the heavy lifting part of the program.

Despite all the pain that's likely to ensue, I'm sure it'll be worth it. I expect to start seeing results in just four weeks and to be in shape by Thanksgiving! If you're serious about getting into shape, start with Buns of Steel. You could then use other exercise tapes, machines, classes, etc. to vary your routine, but BoS is the most cost-effective way to get your act together.",1375660800,6,1777,4.33033033033033

590551,5,6303182135,"I have watched this video (while doing the workout, of course) so many times over the years that I'm surprised the tape has not broken. I'm also kind of surprised that I have not memorized the workout by now...

I lift weights at the gym, both free weights and on the machines, but nothing gives quite the same effects as this workout. If you skip over the aerobic workout at the beginning (and I do), it basically works out to 25 minutes of lower body work and maybe 5 minutes of abs. I rewind and do the ab section twice, then do another different ab video for 15 mins after this.

When I start doing this tape after a fitness lapse, I do it without shoes on. As I get stronger, I put light sneakers on, then heavy sneakers. When I can do all the leg lifts without ""feeling the burn"" in heavy sneakers, then I put ankle weights on. Even at my most fit, when I am doing 20+ mile hikes at 10000+ feet altitude, I have never been able to do this workout with more than 3.5 pound weights on each ankle. So if the workout ever starts to feel easy to you, go get some ankle weights.

This seems to firm and sculpt the muscles in my hips and upper thighs more than anything else. It's a terrific lower body workout. The 80s nostalgia is not lost on me either, and I still enjoy watching the people in the class grin when the instructor makes his dumb jokes. Over and over and over I have heard these dumb jokes, and I still like them. Not sure why.

If I could have only one workout video, this would be it. No contest.",1345248000,17,1514,4.139455782312925

Even though I do a lot of different exercises (circuit training, cross training, yoga, weights, resistance, various cardio, etc.), I find the Buns of Steel video is invaluable in keeping my legs slim and toned.  If you want to build some muscle and strength, then you can't rely on this video alone.  I incorporate this workout into strength-training workouts.

When I am pressed for time I do the butt exercises only (about 15 minutes) and use the full workout when I have more time.  I don't like the tapes that make you jump around.  The exercises really work your butt and you feel muscles you didn't know you had.  It is wonderful.

Greg Smithey knows what he is talking about and with The Original Buns of Steel workout you will be incredibly happy that you purchased the DVD. It's a little pricey but completely worth it! The cardio workout at the beginning warms you up and the intense target training tones your butt and legs. Not to mention the ab workout at the end.

I had to stop periodically until my muscles recovered a bit and then I jumped back in again. Overall, the workout is very good! It's all floor work, which is ideal, and I feel it's more affective than the squats other videos have you do. The workouts in this video are ones you can actually FEEL working.

I got so TONED that I had to start using ankle weights when I did the floor exercises to get more resistance.  My legs and butt looked so good that my friends would ask me how I did it.  I told them all I did was walk a few times a week and do this workout a few times a week.  3 of my best friends actually started coming over and doing the workout with me.  I am now the mom of a 15 month old baby and I want to start doing it again. I have finally lost all of the baby weight, but I am not nearly as toned as I used to be.

I got rid of all of my old VHS tapes years ago, with the exception of this workout.  I have used it SO many times that the tape is starting to wear out.  I used a dvd recorder to transfer it onto a DVD, but the tape was already so degraded that it didn't turn out very well. I am so glad they decided to re-release this workout on DVD.  I remember searching for a DVD version when I was in college but had no luck.

This has always been my all time favorite workout video. Every time I think about it, I think about the time I was in English class doing a group assignment.  We had 10 minutes to come up with as many 2 word noun/adjective combinations as we could think of (chalkboard/dirty, ball/red, alarm/annoying).  After a few minutes of writing, one of the boys in my group looked at me, looked up, then said LEGS/DISTRACTING!!  That moment will forever be stuck in my mind.  It was such a good feeling to know that all my hard work was actually paying off! I want everyone to know that this is an AMAZING workout video.

The other reason I love this video is that it's predominantly mat based. I have bad knees, so I have to avoid squats, lunges, etc. Most of the videos today (outside of pilates) focus on squats/lunges, so I can't do them.

Admittedly, the 80s fashion and music is over the top. Hopefully, the ridiculousness of it will add humor to your workout and help you get through it.",1270684800,8,522,4.316326530612245

590652,2,6303182135,"First, it is funny to see the style of the '80's.  Wow!  What were we thinking?

I do like the instructor Greg, but the workout is an all over body workout and doesn't focus on the buns as the title claims it does.

The speed at which the exercises are done, leg lifts, etc. are done at a rather fast pace and though it's okay, personally I think the pace could and should be slowed down a bit.  So I played the 'floor segment' in slo-motion and found that it was much better.  (I don't do the other portions.) You get the burn either way but with the slo-mo you have more control of your movements and less chance of feeling an ache or pain in your joints.

I say $20 is a bit steep for the quality of this work-out.  I'm sure there are better bun workout DVDs out there and so my quest continues......",1249171200,4,803,4.102564102564102

This, along with the famous Jane Fonda video, was one of my first and still one of the best.  I am so happy it is now available on DVD.  I used to do this video three times a week and was able to do a split up to my mid thirties when I switched to other videos.  I've tried numerous programs, even Tamilee Webb's series and the various Rodney Yee yoga workouts.  Nothing compares to the lower body workout from this old video.  Once you learn the routine, you can turn down the sound and play music if his annoying (and weird) comments turn you off!  I had a baby in March and will be using this video to get rid of those last annoying bits of belly and thigh flab.

Try it and stick with it.  It really works.",1248998400,5,843,4.024096385542169
590674,5,6303182135,"Originally made in the 80s, this video is NOT for you if you care about the appearance of the video and the participants. Sweat bands and leg warmers (and even Jheri Curl I think) abound. And Greg Smithey can drive you CRAZY if you don't mute him or just enjoy the laughs. (""We're going to squeeze out that cheeseburger and that carrot cake."") All that said, I have to say that this is hands down one of the best work out videos ever made (and I've tried a lot) to get your thighs and buns in shape--rock hard and very strong. You can order the DVD directly from Greg Smithey on his web site for only $14.95, so don't pay more than that. I like the DVD cause you can skip the aerobic part (I honestly have never done this part) and start with the floor exercises. I am a mom of 4 and I homeschool, so I have to keep my workout very brief or it just won't happen, so I do 1/2 of the floor exercises one day and the other 1/2 the next, both equaling 18-20 minutes each. The first 1/2 is outer thighs, second 1/2 inner thighs and buns. (I also skip the end ab work; I prefer pilates/ And I do that on alternate days. And I do arm work--push ups and free weights--on my own on days when I have the extra 5 minutes.) And still, after almost 2 years of doing this once a week (okay, some weeks I missed) this workout is still a little tough, in a good way. (If you're new to these exercises, I encourage you to just do as many reps as you can of each, but stick with it and you will see your reps improve.)
This video and a few others (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Abs-Workout/dp/B00029QOTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates: Abs Workout</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Rapid-Results-Pilates/dp/B000GEIRAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Rapid Results Pilates</a>; and Ana Caban Maintenance Pilates for weight loss, which I alternated as ab workouts in that order, adding each after I got rather competent at each) were 1/3 of the reason I was able to loose 40 pounds 1 1/2 years ago and it is great feeling fantastic at 40.
The other 2 reasons?
I started eating healthy (highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SuperFoods-Rx-Fourteen-Foods-That-Will-Change-Your-Life/dp/0061172286/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SuperFoods Rx: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life</a>) and every 7-10 days I ate only fruits and vegetables--as much quantity as I wanted for 48 hours, but only fruits and veggies. I consistently lost 1.25-2 pounds per week, so I lost 40 pounds in about 7 months.
But the most important reason/inspiration for me was Romans 6:12-14...
""Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.""
When I was tempted to eat poorly or turn off my alarm and sleep in instead of exercising and doing my morning devotions, I told myself that ""sin shall not be your master.""
I started the whole process toward weight loss out of sheer obedience to God. I knew He wanted me to take care of myself, and I never had, my entire life really. What I didn't know at the beginning of my 7-month journey was that in the end God wanted me to take care of myself for ME. I have so much more energy now to do so much more. I can mountain hike with my teen and pre-teen daughters and keep one step ahead of them! I used to have pain in my knees occasionally when I went up stairs and lower back pain every morning--no more. I used to snore even--no more! And needless to say, being in the best shape of my life has had a huge, wonderful impact on my marriage.
All that said, I highly recommend this video. There are plenty of buns of steel workouts out there. Some are really wimpy, and in some the instructor yells at you while he's dripping in sweat and bragging about his own physique. I couldn't do most of those more than once or twice because I hated them so much. (I recommend you try videos on loan from your library so you're not wasting money, until you find the ones you like.) Like I said, if you can figure out your own way to get around the 80s look of the video and the quirkiness of Greg Smithey, this workout will deliver life-long, proven results. None others come close to that for me.",1248393600,108,4605,4.7359900373599

I do believe that this video deserves most of the credit for the fact that I do not have cottage cheese puckers on the back of my legs at the age of 39.

I do yoga, pilates, taebo and this tape because of everything I have tried they consistently work for me. Every other tape or dvd sits and collects dust because they don't do it for me!

You don't have to learn dance moves or even be coordinated to do these exercises, yet you will get a great workout.  I still continue to do this video once per week (in addition to walking) to stayed toned.  I do believe that this video deserves most of the credit for the fact that I do not have cottage cheese puckers on the back of my legs at the age of 37.  Greg's outdated outfit and his goofy comments make me laugh... bonus, laughing is great for the abs!

""Squeeze those cheeseburgers out of those thighs""  He's quite energetic through the whole thing, I love the cheesy comments he says it keep you motivated.

There's some interesting characters in the video too that keep you amused.. the crowd is very multicultural, hehe, and multisized.  It's a video that works your butt off (with a bit of warm-up, inner thigh, and stomach exercises) and the instructor makes you feel good through the whole thing. ""Ya, you know if feels good if you know why you're doing it.""

This is an effective workout and just a classic.  There's something about the combination of what he says, in addition to a great workout, and the visual of this 80s video that makes it awesome.

590754,5,6303182135,"I first did this tape three years ago, after a friend told me that doing it for a week straight caused her to lose a pants size. I had no idea what I was getting into. Between the 80s mullets (everywhere, everywhere!), the sea foam colored spandex, and the cheery, effeminate weirdo instructor (who seems to have no problem doing these very difficult exercises), this tape can be a bit much.

I couldn't do even half of the reps the first few times I tried it. But, I did, in fact, lose a pants size after doing it for seven days straight. After that, I've incorporated it into my exercise routine, on and off for the last few years, after purchasing my own copy. I have to say, I really hate doing this tape, but have never found one that gives me results as effectively as it does. It's not easy and you certainly won't enjoy doing it, but if you only get one video for toning your lower body, I would tell you to get this one (and I own upwards of 30 exercise tapes).

I come back to this tape year after year, and even though I can actually keep up with all the reps now, I can never do it with a smile like Greg Smithey, the instructor. My hips and thighs never look as good as they do when I'm doing this video 4X or more, weekly. If you want results, get this tape. After all, no pain, no...er, loss.",1102291200,28,1307,4.141732283464567

It goes by fast, always makes you work, and as Greg Smithey puts it you ""know that something is happening down there"". The impact is felt almost immediately and at a comfortable pace. I've been going crazy lately trying to find videos that are at a good pace and well-instructed. It is funny that my favorite so far has been one made back in 1987. I've talked to people about it and they say it is the best one of out all of the Buns of Steel videos. If you are looking for a good work-out and burn, go for it. Don't be surprised if you spit out a few curse words here or there at first; you'll be surprised at few of the leg movements you do before it just hurts!

I have worked out my whole life at home trying every video that came out starting with Jane Fonda videos and nothing gave me the results this tape did.  While working with the video, Greg gives funny and encouraging comments that really put a smile on my face and made me want to keep going.  It is really hard when you first start out if you are not in shape, but just do a little bit of each exercise and add more each time you do it and you will get where you want to be. It is my absolute favorite!  It starts out with a short arobic workout to warm up your muscles that also works on your arms.  It then you go into the entire leg and [back] workout.  You will feel it in every muscle.  Greg is very thorough. It finishes with a stomach and cool down stretch.  It is just perfect and very enjoyable due to Greg's humor.

590777,5,6303182135,"There's no doubt about it - turning on this video is like turning back time TO THE EIGHTIES.  Admittedly, this tape is dated (after all: it was produced in 1987), but WAIT, don't stop reading yet.  This video is also hands down the best buns, legs, and thighs workout I have ever used.  I was introduced to this video way back when I was about 10 and my aunt used it, and I was just a little kid who thought it was cool to workout (didn't really NEED to back then...).  Since then I have aged, gained and lost weight, needed toning, needed shaping, and in general realized I gotta do something to keep that youthful figure.
This tape has never failed me.  I keep going back to it time after time, year after year, and actually have worn out 2 copies so far. (WISH THEY WOULD COME OUT WITH THE DVD VERSION!!!)  The pastel leotards, leggings and headbands along with the cheesy synthesizer music and comical hairdos definitely date this video but the workout is still the best I have ever experienced for lower body.  Sometimes when I'm feeling the music is just going to be a little TOO cheesy eighties for my taste, I just turn down the volume and turn up my own preferred workout music. (it's easy to follow without Greg's instructions once you have done it a few times over).
For those of you looking for results, this tape is honestly a great bet.  For me, when I am using it regularly (4 times a week or so), it only takes about 3 weeks to SEE dramatic results - toned muscles, less flab, and tighter physique, but takes even less time to FEEL results - there will be less jiggle in your wiggle in no time! AND THAT feels great! :)
Totally worth it - buy this buy this buy this, and you'll see why this is the 2nd rave review I have written on this tape (and I don't write many reviws).  I have talked so many friends into trying this video just based on the results they've seen in me.  This video is the best ever, even after all these years.",1081468800,23,1948,4.269021739130435

I wish it was on DVD because there are so many excellent pieces/parts to mix and match when you don't have time for the full hour-long workout.
