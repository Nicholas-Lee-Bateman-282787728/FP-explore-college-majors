8717578,4,B00Y7R9GYS,"Usual sound performance by Tom Conway, who died of alcoholism shortly after his 1964 performance on Perry Mason with Ray Burr. This film is, I think from 1946. Co-Star Martha O'Driscoll gives out with the beauty and talent and sings all the songs. Plot is typical B picture stuff, but still entertaining.",1453939200,2,304,4.865384615384615
