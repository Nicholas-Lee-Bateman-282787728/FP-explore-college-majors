625266,5,6303320600,I saw mothion picture about Dorian Gray at the first time. This visual image of Dorian is wonderful for my opinion. I think Wilde's Dorian must be like it,1128816000,4,154,4.344827586206897
625267,3,6303320600,"I saw this movie as a kid on late night tv and thought it was much better then the original , then again I was a kid and hated black and white movies , now in my adult years , I haven't seen this 1970's version is quite awhile , but did see the 1945 version again and this time loved it , I then saw the remake with a female version and thought this is interesting too , but alas I have to admit the 1945 version was so much more exceptional .",1122681600,12,443,3.723404255319149
625268,2,6303320600,"And although the picture and sound were great, you didn't miss much.  This appears to be a rather low budget film judging by the sets and clothes (Dorian doesn't redecorate once in 20 years - and his wallpaper never fades either).

Dorian Grey is having his portrait done by Basil, not sure of the relationship if any, when an old, rather dissolute friend of Basil's drops by, and bends the tender ear of Dorian with his tales of a life of fun, and how youth is the only thing worth having. This leads the weak-minded Dorian to proclaim to his portrait that he would give his soul to stay young, if only the portrait would age, and he wouldn't.  He gets his wish....Dorian falls in love with Sybil and wants to marry her, but when this friend advises him to ask her to his house and spend the night, even though she wants to wait until they are married, Dorian, for some unknown reason, decides to heed his advice.  Once he has her, of course, he no longer wants her, and she commits suicide.  Dorian goes on to become completely cold-blooded once this happens.  He's truly an annoying little man.  He proceeds to gamble, have affairs with men and women, and pays for sex with a child.  He also murders.  He also lies in bed tearing off one tiny scrap of toast at a time, then buttering, then putting jelly on the piece, eating it, then repeating the entire process with another tiny piece!  He does this with about 12 pieces and I would have murdered him myself for it! Just put butter and jelly on one slice of toast and eat it!

In any case, Dorian's picture gets gorier and gorier, and even though at one point he hired a handyman to board up the nursery door where the portrait resides, it appears that after that the door to the room is still unimpeded and works as well as ever.  It's at the top of about 10 stairs (which take each person about 5 minutes to get up the last 5 - I had to fast forward this every time).  Dorian likes to visit his picture now and then because he thinks that if he does something good, it will show up in the picture.  However, it just gets worse and worse, so he thinks he might as well continue with his bad ways.  You wonder why he didn't just burn the picture.

Basically, Dorian was a boring, self-centered rich guy, who was not a good person to begin with or none of this would ever have happened.",1120521600,11,2340,4.296127562642369
625269,1,6303320600,"First off...... I liked the story. The acting was mediocre at best - but acceptable.

But this DVD transfer is appalling and has to be the worst I have ever encountered. The picture is grainy and soft. It also suffers from numerous disturbances throughout the film.

The sound is even worse and has to be experienced to be believed. Considerable effort must have been put into making this so bad.

Played on my (very high quality) surround sound system, the entire soundtrack exhibits an extremely echoey effect with the surround speakers fuzzily mirroring the fronts with a considerable time delay. Very weird!

Turning the sound processor off and simply using the front speakers clarified the sound but it still sounded very second rate.... though clear enough to understand without too much effort.

Why, when there are still so many good films out there waiting for a DVD transfer, is resource wasted on producing such a bad disc as this?

Unless you consider that you must have this on DVD for some reason, I would advise passing it by in favour of spending your hard earned cash on another title.",1116374400,18,1102,4.804232804232805
625270,2,6303320600,"Leaving aside audio issues, which are there, not imagined, this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's novella leaves many other things to be desired.

Not only does the screenplay and eerie soundtrack lend an ominous, ""Dark Shadows"" feel to the proceedings, there has been a concerted effort to downplay the homo-erotic subtext of Wilde's work.  Gray is transformed into a Jack-the-Ripperesque, Jeckel and Hyde figure, preying on women, living the life of a rock-star or playboy.  Shane Briant does have a bit of a Freddie Mercury/David Bowie quality about him, but any suggestion that he might be involved with other men is minimized to a few lingering glances and innuendo.

Without Wilde's subtext, some plot points and characters no longer make sense.  Here Sybil kills herself because Gray deflowers her and then abandons her -- in the text it is a split over aesthetics in a much more profound and psychological encounter.  This Gray is simply an insensitive cad, not worthy of the picture becoming so twisted.  Wilde's Gray is a self-consumed aesthete who tires of people and throws them aside when he becomes disillusioned.  This is far more damning to one's soul.

The tell-tale test for me was the handling of Alan Campbell. Compare this rendering with that of the BBC version just three years later.  Again this one doesn't make much sense.  Nor does the relationship with Beatrice, again I feel as an attempt to ""straighten up"" Dorian.

Certainly this production is more ambitious than the BBC version, including remote shots and crowd scenes, but what good are production values when the script is fatally flawed and the mood is reduced to melodramatic horror.

Watch the BBC version with John Gielgud and the far superior Peter Firth.  Not only is that cast more attractive and has a better grasp of the work, it's to be chosen primarily if you want to come anywhere near Wilde's spirit and intention.",1112918400,32,1905,4.949685534591195
625271,1,6303320600,"I wanted to respond to the many reviewers regarding the poor audio quality of this DVD. Evidentally, the transfer was not up to the newer DVD player technology because it plays fine in my older player, but I experience a sound problem when I play it in my newer one. I intend to contact MPI and hopefully get this resolved, and a new, updated copy of this DVD.

Until then, this one gets 1 star.",1110326400,8,395,4.266666666666667
625272,4,6303320600,"This TV version has its flaws, but audio quality is not one of them. My copy has excellent sound: actually louder and clearer than many other DVDs I own. Judging from others' complaints, I can only guess that there are a lot of defective copies out there; unless MPI has now fixed the problem. I'm glad I took the gamble.

625273,1,6303320600,"I saw this movie when it came out in the 70's and it's a great movie, but the sound is so low on the DVD that even at full volume, it is inaudible.

625274,1,6303320600,"As much as I would've liked this film, my enjoyment was ruined by a bad DVD transfer that had a horribly inaudible soundtrack.  When this occurred on my replacement DVD, I had to come to the conclusion that this was a flaw of MPI, who distributed this disc.  While they present a great product in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes films, they do nobody any favors with this slipshod transfer.  It only gets the one star for the solid visuals, but unless you want to crank your TV volume at full blast to even hear a bit of the soundtrack, this is a product that I recommend avoiding.",1031529600,56,582,4.37037037037037
625275,5,6303320600,"I am so glad that Oscar Wilde's genius prose was made into movie form. The cast is excellent. I have always loved John Karlen. I started watching him  when the daytime horror-soap ""Dark Shadows"" was popular. He,  along with Shane and Nigel, give a too true- to- life portrayal of Wilde's  mixed characters battling their own curses and demons that life seemingly  has bestowed upon them. However, it is not exactly circumstances which mold  us into who we are, but our choices and how we handle conflict. I had one  of my English classes watch this movie so that they could see that  everything we do and say eventually makes us who we are, and we can never  undo or repair the damages of ill deeds, greed or lust. It's a frightening  thought. Sometimes it's more difficult to take the hard right than it is to  take the easy wrong, as Al Gore so brilliantly suggested in his 2000  Democratic Convention speech. The fact that man would literally sell his  soul for youth teaches us that our priorities are still out of order. The  conflict of man versus himself is the power point of this book/movie.  Sometimes we truly are our own worst enemies. While the character Dorian  continues to do as he pleases despite hurting others, his portrait changes,  grows old and reveals all of his past sins. This effect is pure genius, and  it really makes one stop and think about his/her own life and choices.  Everyone should watch this movie at least once a month....it's that  powerful and meaningful. I also believe that Oscar Wilde saw himself in  many of his characters. He had a difficult life along with the world  judging him harshly, but he too made choices that cost him everything. In  conclusion, sometimes the hardest thing in the world is self-reflection.",967334400,,1761,4.6677524429967425
625402,4,6303320600,"He who does not know Oscar Wilde is just uneducated. He who does not know Oscar Wilde's ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" is just half human. And any film adapted from Oscar Wilde's stories and plays are a must for any man in this world. I did say man because Oscar Wilde is talking to men about men, and even when he is dealing with women he is addressing men as his privileged audience.

Oscar Wilde was at least bisexual and being Irish and not of noble extract, his gay adventure with the son of an English Lord cost him several years in the prison of Reading. More for than ""perverting"" the son of a lord and future lord himself, and that son remained attached to Oscar Wilde and his work till the end of his life, Oscar Wilde was punished because of the social line of nobility he crossed up, which was unacceptable at the time in England, and will be till the 1980s or so. What's more he dared cross the national divide from Irish to English in his sexual love life and that was a tremendously lot less acceptable than trespassing the first nobility divide, and probably still is or was till at least the beginning of the 21st century.

So this film has to be seen as a fundamental film as for dealing with ""perversion"" and ""perdition"" in English society. The film is discrete about the gay side of things, but a long list of men are said toward the end of the film to refuse to have anything to do any more with Dorian Gray or to step out of a room when Dorian Gray steps in it. That discretion is not important anyway since what is at stake is a lot more than just gayness.

Dorian Gray is young, about 20 at the beginning, and rich, at the beginning again since he will grow poor as years go by. He will be 41 at the end. During those 20 years or so he will do all the villainies and treacheries you can imagine, with women or with men, among other things breaking the hearts of women and leading them to their death or plainly killing men or blackmailing some others like the professor and doctor he uses to get rid of the corpse of his last victim, using the professor's liking men to force him to do something absolutely unethical and make him his accomplice in this crime.

But the appealing and disquieting knack of the novel and the film is the fact that the picture that was done by a famous painter when Dorian Gray was 20 leads Dorian to wishing the painting to age while he himself does not. So at age 41 he is still looking the way he did when 20 and the portrait, hidden away from public view is aging for one and changing in agreement with the horrors Dorian Gray does.

At the end what has to happen happens: Dorian Gray wants to destroy the painting and instead it is him who dies and the curse on the painting reverts itself and Dorian Gray when dead looks his age and carries his horrendous soul ugliness on his face.

But the film reduced to this story line is in fact rather simple and would at best be a horror short story, and in fact was used several times here and there in horror literature. This film and the story behind are not horror literature but deep ethical literature. Oscar Wilde denounces the hypocrisy of English society: ""The value of an idea has nothing to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it."" One can utter the most profound moral statements and yet be the most rotten character on earth. His rotten nature does not in any way degrade the ethical value of the moral statements he proclaims.

In simple words ""those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril."" The real theme of the novel is the fact that the surface of things means nothing and that the true nature of a man is beneath his appearance. Note the well chosen ""beneath."" Oscar Wilde is careful not to use ""behind"" that would not mean a lower level or state. For Oscar Wilde the social world is a superficial appearance and a lower true reality. The appearance is the top surface of things and truth is necessarily underneath. The aristocracy that is at the top of society does not hide a shadow that is at their level but hides an ugliness that is necessarily deep under that aristocratic top surface. Aristocratic societies are necessarily hypocritical and pushing their roots in some deep mud or filth.

Though this is the fundamental idea in the story, Oscar Wilde cannot resist expressing another one he borrowed from Shakespeare. ""Time is jealous of you. Time will have his revenge."" This time is the time Shakespeare describes and despises in his sonnets but with a Macbethian dimension to it. Time is the all leveller but by bringing everything superior down into the muddy pit of human manure.

I will only regret one thing about this film. The actor who plays Dorian Gray is slightly stiff and not directed into some kind of real attractiveness. He may be handsome but he is also tremendously cold or artificial.

625405,4,6303320600,"Like many other people, I saw this movie when it came out in 1973.  I was a huge fan of ""Dark Shadows,"" which was another Dan Curtis Production and I was interested in seeing his version of Oscar Wilde's story.  This version of the Picture of Dorian Gray was ""tastefully"" done compared to Gothic horror films since. Possibly this could be due to the time it was filmed. The actions of the character, Dorian Gray, were more inuendo and not blatantly in your face.  Some sexual excapades were obvious (like his night with Sybil Vane), while other references to pedophilia, homosexuality, and other liasons were hinted. As a result, I appreciated the frightening aspects of hiding his double life and seeing this as a moral tale demonstrating how that life caught up with the character.  I was a teacher at one point in my existence and would have my students read the book BEFORE viewing a film based on the material in that book.  The reason I did that was due to a problem I felt all film makers have when making any film.  They either add to or take away some of the finer points an author writes about when creating a story.  As a result, some of these films lose the original author's intent.  As a classroom tool, reading the book and viewing a film made it easier to compare and constrast the two.  But I always encouraged my students to read the book FIRST, this gave them a better basis to approach both the book and a film.
  The quality of the DVD was fine; it played on my Blueray player. The film has decent sound (I don't think it was supposed to have a surround sound.) Two scenes in the film were slightly discolored possibily because of the age of the film.  Overall, it was great seeing this film after almost 40 years.",1301097600,,1735,4.438485804416404

The DVD transfer is not very good either but that really doesn't seem to matter. This film can't match the cast of George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, and Angela Lansbury of the 1945 version.

Some scenes in which he is still innocent come through ok, as well as some scenes when he is cruel. However, this 1973 version is more intelligently told: it relies a lot on clues and lets the public read between the lines. I understand that they had to resort to this in order to circumvent censorship, but by building the story this way, they were able to show additional evil pleasures that the 2009 version could not touch with a ten-foot pole. Plus, Shane Briant's facial expression changes are really subtle: he conveys the evil, the coldness, and the boredom very well without having to make faces, which makes him a far darker and more evil character than 2009's Dorian Gray.",1457481600,3,1055,4.708108108108108

Dorian Gray does not come off as particularly believable, but as the film is more about philosophy than entertainment it doesn't really matter.  And what we see of how Dorian Gray lives does not seem quite as bad as the painting portrays, so we are left assuming that much that was lived was not shown.

The attempt at reformation towards the end also didn't seem true, but no matter.  The life of the film is in the words of Oscar Wilde that are used throughout the film. There was enough there to keep us thinking for a long time.
