I searched for weeks, and searched for  weeks on the internet to try to find the ORIGINAL tapes with Beto, because these are better than anything they produced since (IMHO). The originals are very precise, less commercial, and concentrate on teaching the correct moves.  I am thrilled with the price, the speed of delivery, and the excellent quality of the tapes.  I am especially thrilled to have found them!  JBL",1379635200,,468,4.670731707317073
8256059,5,B0014ME9UU,So far I am really pleased with these tapes. I still have two to review. The Steps are good for learning the basics. Did the Beginners and really liked that one. The company was very prompt in sending them out. So far so good.,1315872000,,226,4.159090909090909
8256060,5,B0014ME9UU,"I already have owned the old Zumba from 2002 that had Giselle Roque de Escobar who was very sweet & great timing/instruction as well as Beto who is here & Natalie. The 2002 had 60 min of instruction with Giselles's clear English & great analogies. The 30 min beginners & 60 min advanced had additional great dancers & 3 person ""percussion band"" with the great music that demands you move. The quick 20 min Rapido had just jumping around of Beto doing different steps & some regular aerobics mixed in & literally just jumping around like a maniac. I LOVED that set, everyone was a great fluid dancer, were having fun, non-stop aerobics pace, great music & Giselle made learning SO easy & not intimidating at all & have played the beginner & advanced so many times, I know everything down pat to the millisecond.

They have a new 2004 set, but it only has a 20 min learning segment, and the abs section I dislike. The Power & Advanced where the dancing is is good, but the 2002 set is the best.",1246838400,15,992,4.420765027322404
