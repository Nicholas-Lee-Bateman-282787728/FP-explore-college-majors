If you like cheesy Italian horror and/or exploitation movies, you'll love it!

Lorraine de Selle is still on staff and still has that hooker underwear she modeled in CAGED WOMEN, and best of all, the haystack hair blonde and skinny teenish brunette are both doing 20-life here too. The blonde looks as if she's eaten a little lasagna since the previous picture. Her opening scene finds her wearing nothing but *tight* kini panties, over which her tummy roll hangs enticingly. Wow!

Here, dangerous male cons are temporarily housed in the women's lockup, but they get loose and a riot ensues -- at least when they're not having sex with horny femme cons who haven't seen a man since the Aldo Moro administration. No shower scene in my video copy, which is always a drawback, though it does feature a weird theatrical presentation by the inmates, for the inmates.

8253888,4,B00140PKF0,...and the films were every bit as bad as I hoped they would be. A friend and me had a great time watching.,1363737600,,107,3.6956521739130435
8253889,5,B00140PKF0,"This film isn't what I thought it would be.  I thought it was just going to be one of those typical women in prison films where the prisoners are being tortured by the wardens throughout the film, but this was a little different.  It begins like a typical women in prison film and continues to have abuse and fight scenes for awhile, but then it changes when a group of escaped male convicts holds up the prison.  It then becomes an action/horror exploitation film with bloody gun shots, a brain- splattering game of Russian Roulette, and some other bizarre stuff that's a little different than traditional women in prison films.  There's a gruesome scene when one of the guys bites one of the women on the neck using a razor blade in his mouth; and in one particularly funny and memorable scene, one of the men keeps going from cell door to cell door and lets the women constantly fondle his face, chest, and there's a very brief and quick bit of groping below the belt.  He tries this again later on, and It seems that he now did this a little too much because he eventually becomes a bloody mess and drops dead from the women grabbing and clawing him.  Another thing that surprised me is that Laura Gemser has no nude scenes in this one, but there's nudity from other women; full nudity is shown. This film is only recommended for fans of 70s and 80s Italian grindhouse films.  It has catchy 80s style Italian soundtracks, and the dubbing and dialogue are atrocious; I also should mention that I got bored of the film until the parts when the escaped convicts held up the prison, when I first saw the movie, but I watched it again and I now really like it. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, and I think some grindhouse fans might not like it either. The film isn't slow, but it lacks atmosphere and interesting scenery. I didn't think that there was much suspense in the film either. This film is directed by Bruno Mattei; he directed a lot of Italian trash films like HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD. His directing style may or may not be appealing depending on your taste. I should also mention that HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD is a much gorier film. This film is gory in parts, but it's not an extreme gore film.

I thought the anamorphic widescreen DVD quality was great. There's marks and scratches throughout the film with some parts being more scratched up than others, but I thought it looked really good; the scratch marks may bother some people. The bonus film on the second disc is called CAGED WOMEN. This film is supposed to be titled VIOLENCE IN A WOMEN'S PRISON, which is available from Shriek Show. This is typical women in prison film that has Laura Gemser nude.  This film also has some nice 80s style Italian soundtracks.  It isn't nearly as gory as WOMEN'S PRISON MASSACRE but there's a lot of nudity, including some good full nude scenes from Gemser.  The quality on the bonus film is mediocre because it's from a VHS source. The VHS picture quality that's kind of dark interferes with some of the nude scenes. There's also a full screen version of the main film as an added bonus. You also get a small booklet about the film, and my DVD even had a slipcover over it.",1349136000,4,3182,4.468965517241379
8253890,3,B00140PKF0,"Women's Prison Massacre (2 stars)

This release of Women in Prison Massacre (Italian title: Emanuelle fuga dall'inferno) comes as the main feature in this double ""women in prison"" Retro-O-Media package, a film that temporally follows Caged Woman, both by the infamous Bruno Mattei. Contrary to Caged Woman (see next within this review), I was expecting much more. The movie has an ok plot (you cannot expect deep characters or philosophical issues on these films anyway). Here our Emmanuelle (Laura Gemser) is an inmate sent to prison by a corrupt district attorney. Once inside, she and her close friends are subjected to some torture by sadistic female guards, ordered by prison's warden. The warden is supposed to get rid of Emmanuelle and prevent her to uncover corruption by thus attorney. All these characters (and same actors) pretty much repeat what you saw before in Caged Women. What is different here is that four very dangerous male inmates condemned to death managed to get loose inside this prison while keeping a wounded police, the warden, and some of the female inmates as hostages. Let's go to the point now: compared with other entries on this WIP subgenre, you have a descent amount of blood yet nothing extraordinary considering that this movie is from the 1980s. The movie has some female nudity and very little sex content. Thus, I felt that the movie did not take the WIP genre anything further, a disappointment to me.

Technically, this Retro-O-Media release comes in widescreen image format. The transfer is far from perfect, with several scratched scenes. The feature comes with an English audio, and no subtitles. Extras include some trailers.

Caged women (3 stars)

Caged Women (aka Violence in a woman's prison) comes as a bonus feature in this double ""women in prison"" Retro-O-Media package, both films by the infamous Bruno Mattei.  Honestly, I was expecting very, very little from this one. However, Caged Women at least has a credible plot compared with others of this b-movie genre, including Jess Franco's Barbed Wire Dolls or Oswaldo de Oliveira's Bare Behind Bars, just to mention two I know of. Caged Women comes with less explicit sex, torture, and gore compared with these other flicks though. So, this is a matter of taste and choice. Plus, Caged Women comes with an obvious touch from the 1980s: just check the song that goes with the ending credits.

Before watching this film I did some research to find out about uncut versions available. I found what it seems to be a Danish PAL 2 version (entitled as ""Emanuelle I Kvindef Aengslet"" and released by Another World Entertainment) that claims to be uncut as it would run for 99 minutes. This duration is actually what you would expect for an uncut version according to IMDB information posted. Then, two Vipco releases (entitled ""Violence in a woman's prison"" and ""Emmanuelle in Prison"", respectively) claim to be uncut. However, running times posted on Vipco cases indicate 89-90 minutes. That said, the nice surprise came to me as this Caged Women release by Retro-O-Media ran for over 98 minutes in my Sony PC. Most likely then, this NTSC feature of Caged Women is indeed the uncut version of the film. The Danish PAL 2 version still has a widescreen presentation and a booklet that might interest to collectors though. The Retro-O-Media release comes in standard image format, with an English audio, and no subtitles. Extras include some trailers.",1333670400,6,3447,4.986086956521739
