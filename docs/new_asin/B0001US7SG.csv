2025213,4,B0001US7SG,"This was an intensely powerful psychological film. Where it was easy to see what the interest that Peppino had in Valerio, it was more difficult to understand why Valerio wanted to go work with Peppino. I know that sometimes subtitles don't always give a true rendering (according to reviews I've seen of other foreign films), so perhaps something was lost in the translation - I'm not Italian, don't speak Italian, so had to rely on the subtitles.

It was creepy, to say the least, to watch Peppino (Italy's Danny DeDevito) lusting after Valerio (as another reviewer said, and I said this myself when I was watching the film, Italy's Brad Pitt). Obviously, even in the most bizarre of circumstances, it's impossible to imagine that coupling. And we know that Valerio was aware that Peppino's interest in him was more than simply that of a co-worker.

The DVD cover has a quote saying something to the effect of ""all the twists and turns are plausible"". There really any twists and turns. It was a straight forward film. Peppino pursued Valerio, Valerio wasn't interested (at least sexually - he was definitely interested in hopping off to Cuba with Peppino when presented with the idea), and something has to give.

The ending is a powerful one, it will keep you guessing for a bit, and you will probably be surprised by it. I wasn't; I saw the ending in the beginning - but I won't give it away.",1094169600,4,1397,4.6938775510204085
8016564,5,B0001US7SG,"The embalmer is a little filmic gem, as well as a very original proposal. Based on real events, it shows us the odd friendship among two misfits: one of them is an embalmer with a fixed idea.

What it promises be a growing relationship will be disturbed due the irruption of a very alluring femme (Deborah) who will turn the entangled situation.

The film rides between the psycho-thriller and the well known balance between the dominatrix alpha and his victim.

Absolutely recommended.",1517443200,,486,4.902439024390244
8016565,5,B0001US7SG,"The Embalmer is a masterpiece. Matteo Garrone is the best new director coming from Europe. A former director of photography, he makes movies that are unforgettable, both from a visual and a narrative point of view. Highly recommended.",1237507200,,234,5.184210526315789
8016566,5,B0001US7SG,"I was so happy with this movie! It kept we wondering what will happen next and even when I thought I had it figured out, It would surprise me. This movie is really good... And the characters are amazing.there is the lil guy who is just sooo freaky lookng/scary and the main guy who is just crazy hot! Watch this movie. I loved it and I'm sure you will 2",1230076800,,353,4.057142857142857
8016567,4,B0001US7SG,"For me, the best part of this film was the spectacular cinematography with which the physical beauty and talent is captured! Certainly, there will be some points in the movie when you're scratching your head going, 'uhhh why the hell is this happening right now?'
But my goodness, every shot is BEAUTIFUL! The weird and sometimes unbelievable things happen with such an amazing eye that in my opinion they are forgivable if not just to see all the wonderful visual ideas the director put into it.",1217376000,,496,4.77906976744186
8016568,1,B0001US7SG,"I just got done watching this DVD and boy was it bad. Its hard for me to remember when I watched a movie I disliked this much. My husband agrees. The entire plot could have taken place in less than half an hour and it was about as suspenseful as an episode of Sesame Street. The main actors were probably pretty good, but since I don't speak any Italian I'm not 100% sure, but even good actors/acting still can't save this film. If you like watching foreign films like ""Tod in Venedig"", then go ahead and rent this film, maybe you'll like it and you'll only lose a little money and time but you definitely wouldn't want to buy this one because you aren't going to watch it more than once!",1198281600,,688,4.259541984732825
8016569,5,B0001US7SG,"I personally find it stunning. Everything about this film is so unique and brilliant. The characters are strong, yet tender, the music is compelling, the acting is wonderful, the story is, well, again, about loneliness. I understand how it might not be for everyone, and that's why I like it so much.",1172016000,,300,4.788461538461538
8016570,4,B0001US7SG,"This movie is really only a bit twisted, but it's a surprise to many because they may not be expecting it to be what it really is.  The twists deal with various relationships and the plot.  Even though they ""twist"" the plot, it's really surprising changes of focuses in the storyline rather than complete twists of keeping the original story intact.  These changes make the movie seem less effective and unique to others.  What makes this movie more of a stand out are little things which may seem more fit for background at first such as embalmed material, Peppino checking to see if his employee is doing a well done job, and clothing.

The embalmed animals, which are supposed to be eerie, didn't come off as that to me because it was part of Valerio's job and it seemed like part of life.  When Valerio's first wife or sister (not sure which) makes a big deal about his work, it makes her seem freaked out.  When Valerio comes in at 4 AM all smelly later on and gets kicked out, then you start to wonder what will happen next.

There's a scene where Valerio's green silk shirt really matches the scene and his personality just perfectly at that point in time.  The shirt is so nice, top of the line material, and so expensive looking that any man would probably look good in it.

The suspense was well driven until the end.  I think they should have showed more than they did, because it was almost like they were saying that the actors were not good enough at acting for action movies, so they decided to leave that important part out instead.",1143331200,,1548,4.453900709219858
8016571,4,B0001US7SG,"I am not usually suckered in by a pretty face on a DVD box; experience has taught me to be extra careful when I find myself drawn to a handsome photo when choosing films to add to my collection.  Nevertheless, the premise of this picture sounded morbidly intriguing, and the hunk on the cover (who is precisely to my taste) allowed me to decide that the purchase of this film could never be a total loss.

I surprised myself by finding this film satisfactory on several levels.  On the superficial, we have the very good performance of an actor named Valerio Foglia Manzillo, a mouthful in all respects.  Mr. Manzillo is handsome in a sort of breathtaking way that makes me feel all fluttery on the inside, and the character he portrays is likeable enough to seal our affection.

But on a dramatic and emotional plane, it is the portrait of the dwarf Peppino, engagingly acted by Ernesto Mahieux, that will strike a chord of identification in the average viewer strong enough to carry The Embalmer through to its uncomfortable conclusion.  Peppino is likable and charming, but suffers from the terminal loneliness often experienced by those whom society labels ""unsexy"".  The people he meets generally respond to him with warmth and affection, unsuspecting that he continually struggles to mask the fact that he is perpetually unfulfilled, sad and somewhat pathetic.  We feel his desperation and acutely sense his sadness, even as he entertains and inspires laughter and joy in those around him.  His secret sexual longings make him especially human and easy to identify with, and this portrait is ultimately the most satisfying aspect of this interesting film.

The gory scenes I expected from the synopsis on the box failed to materialize, but I was far too engrossed in the characters to feel cheated in any way.  This picture is not for everyone, but if you like brooding, dark and thoughtful foreign films, you may enjoy it as much as I did.  In any event, the film is not as shocking as it is romantic and, if nothing else, the sex appeal of the young apprentice will be more than sufficient to hold many viewers' attention.  Others may wonder what all the fuss is about; I know that I have seen dozens of films in the past few months that I found far less satisfying.",1136160000,3,2274,4.726582278481013
8016572,3,B0001US7SG,"After multiple reviews, annotations, articles and notes about the film you haven't seen you usually grasp something. And this something is usually an idea based on some key words. Now imagine that you memorized (like I did) the following key words for ""The Embalmer"": thriller, taxidermy, corpses, mafia, unexpected twists. And you read the following lines on the box-cover as well: ""diabolical thriller"", ""seductive and suspenseful"", ""profoundly creepy"", ""bizarre twists"", ""perverse and chilling""... I guess you'll get the idea and you'll be expecting something extraordinary won't you? Especially knowing it's an Italian movie...

But you will not find anything of the listed above in ""The Embalmer"". Well, there is a story of human obsession with homoerotic overtones and with a murder, but the film is just so lingering and dull. It seems like for the first hour nothing happens on screen at all. And you realize all your expectations are ruined.

Don't get me wrong - this may not be a bad movie, maybe you will like it but I just want to warn everyone who's expecting some intense thriller - it's not intense it's more like boring.

I gave it three stars more for what this movie could have been, not for what it is.",1129334400,2,1222,4.922330097087379
8016573,3,B0001US7SG,"L'Imbalsamatore (Matteo Garrone, 2002)

From the description the library gave of this film, I was expecting a slick piece of Italian horror of the new wave variety (cf. the absolutely brilliant Michele Soavi film Dellamorte Dellamore, which flirts regularly with inclusion on my 100 Best Films of All Time list). What I got was... not. It's a lurid love-triangle tale, an interesting, if flawed, piece of high drama.

The story revolves around L'imbalsamatore himself, Peppino (Ernesto Mahieux, not yet a name likely to be known amongst Americans, but give him a few years). After an interminable opening scene, Peppino approaches young, handsome Valerio (Valerio Foglia Manzillo, in his first film role) and asks him to become Peppino's apprentice. Valerio accepts, and quickly realizes that things are not all as they seem. First, the rumors Valerio has heard about Peppino being tied in to the mafia somehow seem as if they might have some substance. Second, it seems Peppino's interest in Valerio might not be fatherly. Valerio meets up with Deborah (Elisabetta Rocchetti, recently of Non Ho Sonno) and the two of them drift into a relationship. Deborah is even warier of Peppino than everyone else in his life. Complications ensue.

The best thing about L'imbalsamatore, by far, is its acting. All three of the main characters turn in fine performances, and the love triangle is made eminently believable by all three of them. Unfortunately, it would be even more believable if Garrone had more of a sense of pace. The film drags in a number of places where it shouldn't, and Garrone's use of filler is transparent (the long pan shot from the beach to the city, for example, which turns up first in the title credits for a full two minutes, then shows up for thirty seconds here and there when Garrone needs some extra footage). It's a 101-minute film that could have easily been an eighty-five or ninety-minute better film. Still, it's well worth seeing for the performances of the three lead actors. Worth seeking out. ***",1112227200,4,2029,4.979351032448378
