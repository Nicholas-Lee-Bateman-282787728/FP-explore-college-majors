2327022,1,B0009WFFRW,"It is one of the best series I have ever watched!  Maybe because I am Irish and have a Scotch middle name of Campbell! But it is so refreshing to sit and watch a movie that takes one back to when life was simple, where people did the right thing, and where neighbors mattered.  Dr. Finley is a handsome young doctor who drives all over the farming neighborhood to take care of his farmer patients.  This does not mean there are not normal problems, but they are solved in such a simple and ethical way.  I have loaned my copies to various friends and they also return them with a big smile, and say ""thank you"" that was just great!  Dr. Cameron and Dr. O'Neil have an important role in this series which add to its interest.",1415577600,,724,4.255474452554744

2327025,5,B0009WFFRW,"I love, love, love this series.  A step back to a simpler time in a lovely little Scottish village.  David Rintoul at his best and Ian Bannen -oh - Ian Bannen such a great Scottish actor.  In the episode where he sings ""Carrickfergus"" you better grab a tissue first.  Highly recommended.",1395273600,3,287,4.568627450980392
2327026,5,B0009WFFRW,this is family oriented. shows what medicine practice was and how much improved it is today. I like the character development.,1380758400,2,126,5.0476190476190474
2327027,4,B0009WFFRW,"Dr. Findlay is a doctor in Scotland. The series is set after the second world war. It takes place in a little town in Scotland called Tannochbrae. Although most of it is clear concise 'English', there are several characters throughout the series, that speak either with a Glasgow dialect, or are from the Highlands. If you are not too familiar with the accents then you may just lose some of the story.",1378166400,3,402,4.597222222222222

8068076,5,B0009WFFRW,"The show is now set in the late 1940s in postwar Scotland, and portrays life in a busy medical practice. A couple of old characters have gone, making way for the new.  This was another solid season, but might not be to everyone's taste.  There is a rape in the first episode and issues of homosexuality in a later one.  I love this series in general though, and having a woman doctor in the practice makes for some interesting times.",1521072000,,433,4.3875
8068077,5,B0009WFFRW,"Fun series to watch. Love the way things were years ago. How the medical profession improved. Many interesting stores  Was glad to see that the three series is now provided and hope that the fourth will be available soon.

Have now watched the 3rd series & no series 4. Please we need to know what happened to Janet and the group . Amazon get #4 as we are unable to get DVD it will not play on USA equipment!!!!!",1518998400,2,412,4.2025316455696204
8068078,5,B0009WFFRW,"This is a great series about Dr. Finlay who comes back to practice after serving in WWII.  If you want a heart-warming story plot, this is definitely the series for you.  One fault is that the DVDs are not marked at to which one is first.  But you don't need it because each story is self-contained but there is an ongoing story line.  So it would be more helpful to view in sequence.  I still loved it even though I may have not viewed it in 'order.'",1509408000,,451,4.137931034482759

8068084,5,B0009WFFRW,"An extremely well acted and produced series, far superior to more recent BBC offerings, and with a minimum of technical aids: a small town in Scotland, old cars, an old house, and a doctor's bag. The performances, episode after episode, by the principals, David Rintoul, Annette Crosbie, and Ian Bannen, are remarkably strong; the minor characters are unfailingly credible and engaging. Even the music is simple and affecting, not least when Bannen unlimbers his baritone and belts out a verse or two of a folk song. I've read the original A.J. Cronin stories, The Casebook of Dr. Findlay, and looked at snatches of the original television series. The Doctor Finlay series is better than the book and, not surprisingly, far better than the old television series, which in its day was the most popular program on British television but is very dated for a modern audience. Anyone who likes fine Scottish/British acting and story telling should find the whole series, four sets, of lasting entertainment value.",1421452800,6,1008,5.078313253012048
