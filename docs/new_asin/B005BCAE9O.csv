4643735,5,B005BCAE9O,Excellent follow up to his first DVD with wonderful tips and insight into his world of top tier touring and recording. Great player and person. Thank you for a fantastic product.,1320105600,,178,4.774193548387097
4643736,4,B005BCAE9O,"I was also one of the many who were very excited to hear about and finally receive this follow-up to one of the best drum DVDs to come out in years.  The information in the second rendition is again very informative, and of course delivered in a very entertaining method by the slightly quirky Mr. Sucherman, but the production utilized a tremendous amount of green screen overlays which were very distracting from the performances.  The Austin home was such a beautiful place to film the first DVD, and using random footage of that property as a superimposed backdrop just didn't work for me.  The performances are great and the anecdotes are entertaining and informative as always.  I just think the production was a step down from the original.",1318291200,3,747,4.8125
4643737,5,B005BCAE9O,"For me this was a much anticipated follow up to the original Methods and Mechanics I which in itself had already set the bar in drum instructional videos. This sequel is nothing short of just as amazing if not better. The way this material is presented is in a very comfortable conversational tone. It's almost as if you're sitting in the room with him chatting about technique, drumming in general and how the ""biz"" works. The playing on here is of course incredible and Todd does a very good job of explaining how he executes many of his concepts but also leaving room for you to add your own creativity into the ideas presented. One thing that makes this unique is Todd's ability to entertain and captivate with his subtle bits of humor. If you're a drummer looking to expand your style then this DVD is a much needed addition to your educational library.",1318204800,6,858,4.577922077922078
4643738,5,B005BCAE9O,"I've seen Todd playing with Styx numerous times, so when the first Methods & Mechanics DVD was released I knew I had to get it.  M & M I was so well produced and had so much useful content that I wondered how he could possibly follow that up with something equally amazing?

I wasn't disappointed!  M & M II has the same great audio & video quality, as well as many more live and studio playing examples, followed by an explanation and breakdown of what was played, his thought processes involved in creating and playing blew me away.  I'm an OK drummer, but I quickly realized just how much goes into what Todd does.  His piece on ""Windows"" about the realities of Life on the Road is truly valuable if you plan to be a working musician, so many tips shared from his years of experience that can make your life and travels easier because, like Todd mentions, he spends way more time in airports & hotels than he does on stage.

If you enjoyed Todds first DVD, you'll love this one just as much, if not more. I find myself watching it over and over, now I need to move a TV & DVD player near my drumset so I can watch and learn and attempt to play some of the things that this great drummer plays.

P.S. You also get a ""tour"" of the Styx Tour Bus! Enjoy...",1318204800,6,1255,4.182572614107884
4643739,5,B005BCAE9O,"I purchased this video with the understanding that Todd would help me with any drumming skills. After reviewing the entire DVD, this video will expand your knowledge in all area's of being a drummer. Studio or on the road techniques that many never have encountered, practice sessions skills to increase your ability to become better than your usual standard and he shows many home and concert drumming clips of his focused ability that you can vision to get better. This video is made for you to go back and watch numerous times because Todd shows you time signatures/drum pattern's that will blow you away if your a beginner or intermediate drummer. Well worth the price!!",1318204800,,674,4.869565217391305
4643740,5,B005BCAE9O,"What can you say, this is one of the best sequel or ""part 2"" instructional dvds by an artist ever. Great advice for the up and coming musician by a true professional, Todds playing has been taken to a new level on this dvd too. If you're a drummer, truly, this is a must have in your collection.",1318118400,,295,4.103448275862069
8463935,5,B005BCAE9O,"Amazing dvd!! Highly recommended! I wish I would've known the knowledge in this dvd years ago! Todd Sucherman goes over sooo many great work outs, techniques and great ""quick tips"" for being on the road - those helped me especially. I always find myself coming back to this dvd as a refresher and way to think of new ideas for my playing.",1486771200,,338,4.467741935483871
8463936,5,B005BCAE9O,Todd is another master and a very insightful professional.  I highly recommend.,1438214400,,79,5.583333333333333

8463939,5,B005BCAE9O,"This video is super awesome! I cant say enough about the quility of the audio, video and the content presented. I have been playing drums all my life (i am 50 now) and love to learn something new and Todd really did I great job here.

Thanks",1389225600,,241,4.127659574468085
8463940,5,B005BCAE9O,"Bought this for my son, he has learned a ton from Todd, his favorite drummer.  Very impressed with this DVD.",1386028800,,108,4.4
8463941,2,B005BCAE9O,"i have received the dvd and given the name of the artist, i expected a dvd with a hi definition  quality, but instead, the quality was really poor. the package said in the back clearly that the dvd is in hi definition so i don't understand what happened",1362960000,2,253,4.270833333333333
8463942,5,B005BCAE9O,"This is a great secuel to the first Methods and Mechanics; not only because of the outstanding Todd's performances (playing songs from Styx, Beautiful Taylor MIlls, Jerry Goodman, and incidental music film samples), but for the amazing advices on how to be a professional musician. The humor of Sucherman it's such a lovely component of this video, and of course, the teaching sections will improve your drumming into a more musical perspective, including great technique (Wich actually most of the drummers out there are looking for in a DVD), but this is more than just technique. Todd do not show ""how to do"" the stuff, but how to apply it into musical language.
Please, if you are hesitating about this DVD... Don't. Todd is a great human being, a great drummer, and of course... a great teacher and musician.

8463943,5,B005BCAE9O,"I loved the first Methods and was a little hesitant as I didn't know if he could deliver again. Well Todd not only did it again, but also did it better. This video is great. It has great tips for the travelers and awesome music. Another hit.",1350864000,,241,4.148936170212766
8463944,5,B005BCAE9O,"Todd is AMAZING! This Instructional DVD is also AMAZING! Very informational, Funny and interesting! I Highly recommend this, as well as his first dvd, worth every penny!",1349136000,,169,5.296296296296297
