8148395,4,B000J10GVI,Really good teacher - but the student must practice and be patient.,1426896000,,67,4.666666666666667
8148396,4,B000J10GVI,I learned quite a bit from Paul's DVD.  Remember to pull down the tabs from the website.  Two suggestions:  1) fingering diagrams either inset or posted on the website 2) Resources section for additional learning.,1338940800,,213,5.0285714285714285
8148397,5,B000J10GVI,I saw Paul playing on youtube.com while looking for Rockabilly style guitar instruction.  I wanted to broaden my playing style and found this to be the perfect selection.  He goes through each line slowly and explains everything. This is an intermediate DVD but beginner's will get a lot of benefit from it as well. You can get the guitar tabs (recommended)from his website at no extra cost.,1235260800,4,391,4.82089552238806
8148398,5,B000J10GVI,"This is a great intro into Rockabilly flavored Travis Picking. These lessons are truly for the intermediate/advanced player, though they aren't too hard. (nor too simple!) If you allready know a handfull of Travis picking, this will take you into some new directions.
What's taught here is Rockabilly finger picking.
I've tried lots of guitar DVD's and books, this is one of the best.",1182902400,8,384,5.015625
8148399,5,B000J10GVI,"Now after viewing quite a handful of instructional dvd's ands books it was a great pleasure to come across this one although i had his rockabilly dvd first my comments are for both. Paul Pigat has a good talent for teaching and really gets down to the meat of what students really want when choosing this style to play. Although the dvds are aimed at the intermediate to advanced player,i myself of only 10 months into playing found them very helpful and not too difficult to learn. Once you see these 2 dvds you will find strumming chords boring compared to this style of playing. Easy 5 stars",1160870400,5,594,4.5092592592592595
