8105672,3,B000E3LGHE,"The Mistress of Unit C does not really deliver what you expect and the title is deceptive. Basically Torchlight Pictures are trying to inflate sales by attracting those into Femdom, BDSM, Fetishes, or simply those curious about that stuff. They try to hook your interest by the title, then adding the description Susan is a professional Dominatrix, giving you the expectations for such things. Honestly they depict her more as an escort or a prostitute you might find on HBO's Cathouse than anything to do with Female Domination. I found it almost amazing barely any fetish stuff is in this movie, no foot worship, shoe, boot, facesitting, or just about anything else you can imagine. I've seen hotter Domination action on dating shows, at the very least some foot licking, toe sucking, and foot massaging would have been expected. Sad that even random hardcore or softcore movies have more fetish related action than this production did. For example it isn't uncommon that they contain mild foot worship, boot licking, sucking on the heels of shoes, facesitting, bondage, whipping and many other fetish related activities.

Sadly this contains only light simulated bondage, some feather play, and very easy whipping, the cat o' nine tails used looked like something you could buy of Amazon for 5 dollars. Other instruments were used for that goal too, I'm just trying to give an idea how flimsy certain BDSM related items appeared. In a few spots you get teased that you might see real domination, expecting something to happen to save the scene, yet it never really does. I'm grading this basically for what it is, a softcore trying to trick people into buying it, expecting fetish action. From a purely softcore perspective I've seen a lot worse, though I've seen more Fetish action in bad B-movies hehe. There are barely any beaver shots in this, just to give an idea Brinke Stevens shows you more in Sorority Babes in the Slime Bowl-O-Rama. Don't expect to sink the pink either or ever see it in this film. You have 5 Sexual Scenes, I'm sure that is why most people would buy this, since the plot and story are handled badly at best.

Pros: I felt there was some attempt to dispel the myth that a Dominant has to be a certain image or ideal. Since the reality is anybody could be into D/s, even if they look sweet, innocent, or like a Librarian hehe... The picture quality seemed good, though certain scenes can be annoying to watch. Fans of Angela Nichols (Susan), Jenna West (Wendy aka Natasha), or Jadra Holly might enjoy this more than I did. I have nothing against anybody in the movie, I can't say any are ultra hot, though their scenes could have been done better. I blame that mostly on the writer or director instead of the cast, unless they refused to do certain scenes and fetishes. For those looking to ease into bondage and light whipping, this film makes them appear rather harmless. I can't say I see any real Domination in this movie, yet nothing is shown as scary or in a negative light. Other than the Females are depicted like Prostitutes rather than anything relating to Female Domination. The first sexual scene was all right, though it was probably the best in the entire movie too. Instead of building off it, getting into other fetishes or some actual Domination, things go in the opposite direction. I think if they went in the right direction after that scene this movie would have been saved.

CONS: Anemic Fetish action, lacking totally in certain encounters, I'm trying to remain open minded. The film's sexual scenes don't involve enough Fetish content and the clothes stay on too long. If your idea of bondage is fastening somebody's hands together with a tie, then this is for you. Another binding example was seeing chains wrapped around each wrist to constitute bondage, yet the person could easily slip out, while unused handcuffs are shown in the background. I found it upsetting how the women are shown in this movie, I don't claim to be into womens lib or anything like that. I think all the women in the movie seem needy to some degree and Susan most of all. They claim she is a Pro Dominatrix, I disagree, in the film I saw she was an upper scale escort at best. Bobby is her first client and is shown to have sex with her at a party packed with people. Wendy who later goes by the name Natasha to Dominate Bobby also has sexual relations with her during their ""session"" and later with Bobby. Natasha's ""session"" to supposedly Dominate Bobby was very inconsistent and lacking on many levels. Bobby even has sex with her and ends up whipping her in total control of the situation. Natasha gives him the treatment you would expect from a kinky whore, I feel bad for those who expect this from a Pro Dom. They never establish what she does as a pro vs. her relationship with Bobby, the closest to this they come is when she lets him watch her with a supposed client (Jenna West). Which actually ruins the scene, since every so often they would zoom focus on Bobby's face watching them. I thought it was akin to videos from hot women when during it they show the band members or something else you don't want to see. I mean honestly who buys a DVD like this wanting to see Bobby sitting on the bed watching in his shorts, t-shirt and sneakers?? He never joins in, nor does it build any real direction ending stupidly. There are no DVD extras, the scene selections give you 4 options, really 3 since the first choice takes you to the start of the movie. The best scene (about 7:43) isn't even among the chapter options. Bobby's ""session"" with Natasha is left out too, at least the others take you a few minutes before a sexual encounter begins. I just think it shows such a lack of respect for the consumer who buys this product in the first place.

Blazed Bits: I have to say the tagline on the box ""Her Door Is Always Open"" at least is accurate to how they depict the women in this flick. I think if you are in a relationship with a person this film might help them be open to trying some light bondage and whipping. I know some people are repulsed by certain fetishes, so not having them in this movie might make it appealing to them. Nothing is shown to seem scary, strange, or anything to fear trying. I would have liked some real Domination, I'm not saying hardcore stuff, though at the very least some foot worship would have been nice. I mean even the bondage isn't ever real if you look at the scene, nor is any of the Domination for the most part. I liked how the first scene was, maybe I could have done without her wearing a mask during it. Also a bit of facesitting would have helped this flick a fair amount. Nobody is ever bound helpless if that is what you are expecting to see, more like mild kinky sex if anything. Before you start watching, I suggest you skip to about 7:42 into this movie.

PS (Possible Spoilers) A movie like this really don't have spoilers since any story is usually tossed in to fill time. Bobby's friend Jack hires Susan as his housewarming gift, since he got a card giving him a 20% discount. Susan ends up having feelings for Bobby, as he does for her, Pretty Woman with Whips hehe. There are 5 Sexual Scenes in this movie, I'll explain and comment on them here more fully. The first one is perhaps the best (begins about 7:43) scene, Susan appears wearing a mask and Domination garb... Bobby is sitting on a couch at a party when she arrives, she is holding a feather and a thick chain too... The music is kinda cool, she starts doing a little dance, puts the chain on his neck, takes him into the bedroom and starts undressing him. You get some mild bondage with her tieing his hands with a tie and using a feather on him. She pulls on the chain around his neck a bit, though it is open like a U would be... Hence she has to pull on both ends or it would come off him, she keeps the mask on the entire time which might bother people. Susan is basically on top of Bobby grinding him a bit, touching, holding his hands down at times, kissing and things along those lines. She places a blindfold over his eyes at some point, I think from start to finish this was probably the most Dominant overall spot in the entire film... Though more a sensual teasing type you might find among married couples who like to kink up their sexual relationships without really getting into D/s fully. About 14:44 in Susan finally takes off her top for those desiring female nudity. I noticed something about 15:15 lands on top of her breast and falls off, I'm not sure what it was either. Bobby helps take off her bottom around 15:47 and then she covers his eyes with the blindfold again :)... She mounts him for a while and puts his tie around her neck, then starts pulling on the two ends of the chain around his. She puts her gloved hand on his face for maybe a second for those looking for a small breath control moment. They loop a few parts, though you expect that in these types of movies, a bit after 20 minutes the fun is over. This is the only time in the movie I can say the Woman was Dominant from start to finish, she saw what she wanted and took it. Sensual without any words needing to be spoken, something probably appealing to a couple looking for spice in their romance to watch. Bobby wakes up alone with his mind totally blown, the flick is pretty much all downhill from this point.

More Spoilers: The Second Sexual Scene involves Bobby's friend (Jack) and the girl (Jadra Holly) he seems with at the moment. They start in a small bathtub, some mutual oral, and doggie style in there. Then both exit and have some Santa style action, doggie, fingering, and your typical softcore screaming. Fetish devoid, wouldn't likely appeal to those into Femdom, though a pretty decent to good softcore sex scene. The girl had the cute neighbor look, she has some freckles, blemishes, and other flaws about her body that might bother a perfectionist . Scene Selection takes you to 20:41 but the sex don't start till about 23 minutes in, ending at about the 31 minute mark. The Third Sexual Scene (34:34) had so much potential but failed to fully deliver, at least you can skip to the start of it. Susan has a client (Jenna West) arrive, Bobby ends up invited to watch the session. All you see is some light bondage, whipping, blindfold use, and simulated oral satisfaction. Susan only has her top off for about 2 minutes in the scene. At one point it seems Susan hands control over to her client, this sounds better than it really was. Music plays during it, so you don't get to hear any of the action. Jack is sitting on the bed observing in his shorts, t-shirt, and sneakers. Any arousal is destroyed by closeups on Bobby's face, he does not seem stimulated by it, further negating any enjoyment by the viewer. Bobby being in the scene made it seem like the Dominant Man watching his Kittens play and any shots of him ruined the mood. This is akin to watching a hot female singer on TV and they show closeup shots of her ugly band members. Things end lamely, Susan basically says she has an opening around 7, should she pencil him in... He makes a lame excuse and runs out of there, the encounter ends at about 50:45, a lot of time wasted.

Final Spoilers: Sexual Scene 4 (54:18) Bobby expects Susan to Dominate him via his appointment, only to end up serving her client (Jenna West) instead. A shame since Susan was in a nice outfit when she answered the door, yet she never joins the action :(... Wendy her client informs Bobby she goes by the name Natasha in the playroom/dungeon. Music plays during this scene but you can clearly hear the whipping and dialogue for the most part. The scene starts with potential, perhaps Bobby will be taught a harsh lesson for his rudeness and lying to Susan several times. Natasha basically has sex with him, whips him a bit, and playfully taunts him with her words. She does not stay in control that long, they even toss in some simulated oral service from her. I kept thinking Susan would walk in at some point taking over the action, I hoped in the scene prior both of them would eventually Dominate him. Sadly this never happens, even though you think you hear footsteps or a sound like she might enter several times during the action. Bobby eventually ends up with the whip in his hands, he even whips her a bit and takes her Doggie style. I wasn't really into Natasha, at best her time spent with him was something you might expect from a prostitute or a switch. Bobby mostly appears the Dominant one, he even spanks Natasha a fair amount and is in total control. Bobby talks down and dirty to her, maybe you could argue Susan did this partially to show him what being in control can be like. The scene ends at about 69 minutes, as he leaves he has some silly dialogue with Susan. Typical guy he paid for an hour session and lasted only 15 minutes hehe. Final (5th) Sexual Scene starts with Bobby reading the Mistress of Unit C card and tossing it in the trash. Susan comes crawling to him like a needy woman who can't find a decent man, she informs him that she don't want him as a client. She wants him personally not professionally, this is supposed to take place several weeks after his session with Natasha. He admits to being an idiot, never apologizes for lying to her and some of his other mishaps though. He asks if Susan wants to catch a movie, she says not yet... Then they engage in softcore sex, her outfit is pretty bland too, something suited for a 76 year old grandmother. The action starts about 72 minutes in and ends at 84:20 with the credits rolling immediately. I found this the weakest scene in the entire movie, talk about ending on a low note... You get her giving some simulated oral which is the closest anything fetish related happens, Susan has her clothes on for the bulk of this. Bobby even gets Susan doggie style, though in a far gentler way then he was with Natasha. Bobby does simulate giving oral after all this till Susan achieves release, then they embrace and the credits roll abruptly. They don't list who played who in the movie, for any who care Blade Simpson did the music, while Dino Bravo and Barrett Blade were the male talent.

Only buy this if you want a softcore with some light bondage and weak whipping mixed into things. You get about 64 minutes of Sexual Related Content...",1186099200,4,14344,4.493103448275862
