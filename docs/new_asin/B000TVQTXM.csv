Then as the commercials ended, I waited for the movie to begin. Nothing. I tried the DVD in a BluRay player, a DVD player (which was recently purchased at Amazon) and then on my computer. Same scenario - 6 minutes of commercials and no movie. Then I realized that Rohit Jagessar wanted the viewer to experience slavery and bondage without respite - he accomplished this with the 6 minutes of commercials and no means of escape without any relief and without the promised payout of a movie, indeed, the DVD reflects what the indentured Indians suffered - bondage, forced to do something without the promised payment at the end.

Eventually I was able to view the movie. Authenticity be damned! This movie flipped from one concept to the other, accents changed as the minutes went by. The heroine was as transparent as diaphanous wax paper and the hero left a lot to be desired. The premise is a good one, but the execution was appealing, the only thing well executed was my soul as I suffered through what seemed like 150 years of indentureship. Then again I had an epiphany; Rohit Jagessar wanted the viewer to endure what his ancestors endured at the hand of the British and Irish in Guyana! This movie will bring you to tears, it will make you suffer and it will give you a clear idea of bondage - you even get to pay for your own abuse buy buying this DVD.

As far as the content and the storyline goes, it is utter garbage. I bought this after seeing 12 years a slave and wanted to see the other side of the coin, post slavery. I was disappointed.

I would not recommend to anyone as it presents a skewed idea of indentureship and forces the viewer to suffer needlessly.",1414886400,2,1826,4.444776119402985

I firmly believe that this is important for all Guyanese to see, especially Indo-Guyanese youth. Watching this will help them appreciate the struggle and strength of their forefathers. It will educate them about their roots and give them a sense of pride in being Guyanese of South Asian origin. This film should be more widely available so more people could get the opportunity to see it and be enlightened. Finally, a film about OUR story and it really is one that needed to be told. I hope more movies like this will be made in the future because it is so important for us to understand our past, have pride in who we are as a people, and embrace both our South Asian and Guyanese heritage. I really applaud the great effort and thought put into this wonderful film.",1294531200,6,925,4.544910179640719
