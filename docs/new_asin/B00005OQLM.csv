7949131,5,B00005OQLM,"I was pleasantly surprised that these workouts actually took place ""live"" at Fort Benning, GA in an actual Ranger School class!  Very authentic!  This is a tough calesthenic workout.  It includes various stretches and warmups.  The endless flutter kicks and Ab work is killer.  If you want a great workout without weights, one that can be performed on the floor of your hotel while traveling (and no gym facilities available), this is the tape for you!
