This christmas special is longer than a regular episode, fully uncensored (more swearing & blood), and completely hilarious as you take a look into the various traditions practiced by the gang around christmas time and learn their dark secrets from christmases past...",1257724800,16,404,4.704225352112676
3936046,4,B002IFUCYE,"They show the list price at $26.98, for a 43 minute ""movie""? $19.99 is still way too much for what is basically half the length of an average movie. I'm a huge Sunny in Philly fan, but I'll have to wait 'til that comes down to around $12.99 (what the price should be to start with). I hope they show it on TV, but as best I can tell there is still no word on that (edit: looks like it will NOT be shown).

That being said, I have no doubt the show itself will be 5*, so I have no problem going ahead and giving it that rating. I mainly just wanted to comment on the price. I'll edit my rating if need be.

edit: Down to $17.99. Getting there.",1257206400,8,642,3.8931297709923665

3936052,5,B002IFUCYE,"One of the funniest Christmas movies/tv specials of all time. It deserves it's place next to Christmas Vacation, Home Alone 1 and 2. The gang (a group of highly dysfunctionall friends who run a bar in Philadelphia and whom serve as the shows antihero protagonists) set off to rediscover the meaning of Christmas. Along the way, the show explores some incredibly hilarious memories of the gangs Christmas past, setting the stage for what is very possibly the funniest take on the classic story ""A Christmas Carol.""

This episode was too much for tv, and it's very clear why. Nothing was held back, and it pays off in dividends here.

Personally, I found this to easily be one of the funniest and most memorable episodes in the shows history. Instant classic.",1480204800,,757,4.815384615384615

3936227,1,B002IFUCYE,"Okay, I understand the ""no limitations"" rule this ""movie"" had, but did Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day have to go out to make it such an ugly direct-to-dvd film? Without FX censoring them, they couldn't hold back the cursing, violence and the nudity. Oh my god, the Santa/mall scene was horrifically sick to sit through, as was the Elf Charlie was totally out of character. I only liked the Simon bit and the home videos from The Gang's childhood. Nothing else felt like it was from Sunny, and it totally would've ruined my Christmas spirit had I watched it during December (I watched it in July). Now, I love the series. I have many favorite episodes and I think every season they get better and better. But not this train wreck... I felt that if the special was censored by FX and Rob and Charlie did a better job keeping everyone in character, this would've turned out excellent. I'm guessing they realized how bad it was because they never mention the events of this episode in future episodes. Now whenever I hear ""It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" by Andy Williams or ""Jingle Bell Rock"" by Bobby Helms I think of this dang piece of rubbish. I can't wait until I break the disk and burn the cover. I think giving this dreadful thing to someone else will be the worst possible gift they could receive and they might bite MY ear off.

Bought this on blu-ray from Amazon after the good experience with season 6 on blu-ray from here. And again I was happy to find out that this region A blu-ray plays on my Australian blu-ray player.

There is not a heap of extras for this special Christmas special blu-ray but they have a nice small collection of extra content along with the main feature. The extras are in SD not HD and 4:3 format rather than 16:9. This is very common with extras on blu-rays so no downgrade in review rating from me.

Overall for the price on Amazon, it is good value and given it works in Australia, all the better as it is not available for purchase in Oz.

3936447,5,B002IFUCYE,"A Very Sunny Christmas is a 43 minute ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" Christmas special. Charlie and Mac try to regain the Christmas spirit after they realize their childhood Christmas memories weren't exactly as happy and magical as they thought; meanwhile, Dennis and Dee create a ""Christmas Carol"" scenario for Frank to teach him a lesson and punish him for his fake-outs. This is a hilarious episode. Plenty of memorable scenes and dialogue. The ""fake-out"" is the most memorable, in my opinion (I might use it some day); I also enjoyed the encounter Charlie has with Santa Clause in the mall, which ends in blood; and, Frank being seen into a leather couch. It packs in a lot more than that, thought, and it's consistently funny. This is a great episode, especially during the holiday season.

Overall, this is an amazing, funny episode, whether you're a fan of Always Sunny or not (this may even make you a fan.) However, it's definitely overpriced. If you have Netflix Streaming, as of 12/27/12, this episode is available as the last episode in Season 6.

3936476,2,B002IFUCYE,"2.3 stars

I loved the first season: twisted, low-key genius. The second season was still good but DeVito's presence takes away from the bare-bones charm of season one. Season Three, you can already feel the actors kind of locking into the easy choices and playing up what they know has worked before. Haven't seen the other seasons yet, but grabbed this from Flockcluster to get Xmas in my brain as it's 103 outside right now.

Sigh. I got maybe two good laughs in 42 minutes here, whereas in Season One I got two good laughs a minute. It's not because I'm used to it all, it's because the writing is getting lazy. You can feel that they've gained some fame by this point and it's all a little too easy for them; there's just not enough edge here. Sure, there's plenty of edgy ideas and lines, but the feel isn't there. Case in point: biting Santa. Too much blood, not enough real humor. Wow, you bit Santa. Quick guffaw. But that's it. The early shows on cancer and abortion had more depth to them, as much as a show this wonderfully shallow can have depth. This is the single worst episode I've seen of about thirty-plus so far.

Plus which, how do they sell this for 25 clams?! There's one 42 minute show, a 7 minute doc, less than 3 minutes of deleted scenes...and that's it. That's less than an hour of stuff. Sell it for 10, maybe, but never 25.

Yet that just proves that the shark has been jumped; they're in cash-grab mode now, but frankly this is just a rip-off. On this site it's barely cheaper than the entire first and second seasons, which offer literally almost ten times more show, and far more humor.

If you're a huge fan of the show, rent this, maybe. But if I was a fan and got this for Xmas, I'd feel like Frank's kids: ripped off, cheated, scammed, kablooey.",1281830400,3,1781,4.384848484848485

I never saw my brother laugh until he cried! My mom (who has the same taste in humor as my brother) couldn't stop laughing and quoting it. My dad...well, he just doesn't get good senseless humor. He walked off to start preparing our Christmas lunch. Some people just don't get it I guess.

It's A Very Sunny Christmas is extremely hilarious, but charging 26.98 (even though right now it's on sale for 14.99) for basically 2 episodes is down right criminal, and a slap in the face of Sunny fans that have been there since the beginning and remember when they owned season 1 & 2 and no one else had heard of the show. Not to mention with how much they're making on all the season DVD's, they could have sold this for $5.99 and made good money.

3936522,2,B002IFUCYE,"I am a fan of Always Sunny and own all the seasons on DVD. I am NOT  a hater. This DVD is basically a double episode of Always Sunny with a Christmas theme. There are some funny bits, but it is not an outstanding episode. DVD Extras are weak and not worth the time.

What I think happened is this: The Always Sunny gang wanted to make a Christmas episode for broadcast, but when the suits saw this episode they balked and said ""no way"" to airing it. I mean, this thing pushes more boundaries than ever! So the gang added some minimal dvd extras (very minimal) and packaged it for a DVD release. (Possibly this was prompted by the suits at the network to recoup production costs, but maybe not.) Anyway it is an attempted cash grab and not worth the $20.

The clay-mation scene near the end was a GREAT idea, but I feel, a missed opportunity. It started well, but they went for gross and violent instead of just being Always Sunny. It was the one part I was really hoping to see, but it turned out to be a let down, and not funny at all.

The DVD Extras are s few deleted scenes with Mac and Charlie as kids, and a ""Sing-a-Long With Always Sunny"" which is HORRIBLE. They shot the 'Sing-a-Long' segment with odd lenses and tried to make it look like a Stephen King Horror movie, complete with odd sound effects. EPIC FAIL! Not funny, or even entertaining. Always Sunny is not about a nunch of serial killers! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?

As the actual episode goes it is pretty good, but not great. There are some ""Christmas Past"" flashbacks that allow the viewer to possibly understand why all these people are so damaged. Dee and Dennis do not have well written parts in this one, It's mostly Mac and Charlie with some decent Frank bits thrown in. I personally found the funniest parts to be Charlie's. The one standout exception is, ""Is there a man in that couch?"", and not for the DeVito nudity; for the concept. It made me laugh to see Dee and Dennis basically say, ""There is no man in that couch..."" and then ""...cut him an airhole before he suffocates."" However Charlie's freakout scene with the mall Santa can't be beat!

Yes this is rude, offensive, wrong headed, and base. But that is par for the course for Always Sunny, so quit your complaining HATERS! This is not an episode for casual viewers, and would probably scare away the unintiated. My reason for giving it 2 stars is that it is a single double length episode for $20 (if it's on sale)! Way too pricey! If not for the price I would give it 3 or 4 stars.

I hope they include this in the season 5 box. It does not need to be a stand alone product. WARNING: DO NOT BUY THE BLUE RAY VERSION! THIS WAS NOT FILMED IN HIGH DEF, AND THE BLUE RAY IS UPCONVERTED STANDARD VIDEO!",1262044800,38,2735,4.319688109161794

3936533,4,B002IFUCYE,"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is one of the funniest shows on television. Taking bits and pieces from news headlines, the crew on Philadelphia always makes shows that are funny while also fitting in with the news zeitgeist. As always, I'm a big fan of film and TV that fits in with what's going on today and has something to say about modern social/political moors. I can't say that It's Always Sunny has something to necessarily say regarding today's climate, but it is always funny and entertaining.

Charlie and Mac realize that the Christmases they've had in the past weren't true Christmas traditions, in turn they try to make their pasts right. Dennis and Dee are tired of Frank buying Christmas presents they wanted for himself, and find his old partner, Eugene, that he cheated out of millions of dollars to help show Frank that he's a bad man and needs to shape up or he will die alone.

 A Very Sunny Christmas is no exception. Directed by Fred Savage (for those of you who know the name, yes it's who you think it is; for the rest of you it's Kevin from The Wonder Years) A Very Sunny Christmas fits right along with anything in the Philadelphia catalogue. It's groundbreaking, it pushes the envelope, and it's very funny. I can't point out the news articles they used for this, but because of the fact that they don't just use national news (brilliant!) at times the show is at times hard to determine where they got news from. I choose not to dock the crew for this because of the fact that the show is always funny, and, here, reminds us of how some people have it, or don't have it, at Christmas. It's always important for us to remember that not everyone has it as good as us at Christmas, and that's something that Sunny tries to show us in this series, in a very funny way.

Don't expect anything new from the acting. If you like the series you're going to enjoy the acting in this, the characters are playing the same people they've always played, but if you don't care for the series, naturally you won't like this.

Having watched this, not by myself, but with my girlfriend, I must say that I enjoyed it completely but she didn't. A Very Sunny Christmas takes things a lot farther than the series is able to take it. This means there is more butt cheeks shown in this special, and a lot more use of foul language used. (And a very graphic scene dealing with a Christmas icon that might jar many people awake from just sleeping!)

I find this very enjoyable, and it will become an annual part of my Christmas right next to Bad Santa, but I can't say the same for everyone. If you've never seen It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, check it out and determine if you want this in your collection, because the push the envelope farther than they ever have. If you have seen it, you'll probably love it, but once again, check it before you buy it and show it to the family.",1261180800,4,2892,4.4369114877589455

  Good.

  That's just the way I like it. Nothing to worry about until Thanksgiving, and even then, if you suck at cooking like I do and don't have any children to haul to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, you may have to pick up some beer and wash some dishes. However, marketing geniuses in the retail world have caught on to this euphoric lull, and began a quest to start Christmas joy before Halloween. As if seeing Santa at the end of the Thanksgiving parade wasn't bad enough.

  F**kers.

  So, when I heard It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia was releasing a Christmas Special DVD, I was a little annoyed. Don't get me wrong, I was just as annoyed at seeing Jim Carrey's Christmas Carol in 3-D Disney Awesomeness in theaters beginning last Thursday. I don't even do 12 days of Christmas, unless you count shopping days. A week before Christmas, I pop Bill Murray's Scrooged into the DVD player, and don't take it out except for a viewing of Gremlins, Bad Santa, Nightmare Before Christmas, and The Ref. There are others, but those are the main seasonal movies in my world.

  So where, or when, does A Very Sunny Christmas fit into the holidays? Right now, actually, before you really want to get into the Christmas spirit, and would rather whine about it. Or maybe just the week after Thanksgiving.

  The story is of the normal Sunny style. It's Christmas-time at Paddy's Pub, and the gang is getting into the Christmas spirit, or out of it. Dennis(Glenn Howerton) and Dee Reynolds(Kaitlin Olson) are pissed at their ""childhood father"" Frank(Danny DeVito) because he has repetitively, and purposefully, screwed them over on presents every Christmas, and manages to one-up himself this year. Mac(Rob McElhenney) is pissed because he found out his family spent every Christmas robbing other families. Charlie(Charlie Day) is pissed because he found out multiple Santa Clauses banged his mom. Everyone is pissed at Charlie for wearing a ridiculous Christmas sweater. Wait, that was me.

  Mac and Charlie go out into the city of Philly to rekindle their Christmas spirit. Meanwhile, Dennis and Dee resort to creating their own, extremely lackadaisical Christmas Carol story in order to get Frank to change his ways and buy them something, anything, for the holidays. Through these trials, the gang learns how to come together as a family, overcome trials of the world as well as the heart,  and love one another, unconditionally.

  Yeah, and Robert Goulet is going to spring out of my ass alive and well, singing ""Silver Bells.""

  The main thing about this DVD is that it is the Christmas you would have imagined these characters having. It's funny, it's dark, it makes you feel like a better human being for not being this way, and worse for laughing at it. This is what It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is all about. Some of the greatest moments are seeing Frank stumble around an office party naked, Charlie attacking a Santa Claus, and a claymation segment that will forever scar your enjoyment of claymation Christmas specials like Rudolph saving Christmas with help from Hermey, The Bumble, and the California Raisins.

  The special features aren't too bad. The Young Mac and Charlie deleted scenes are nothing great, showing why they were deleted. The Making Of featurette(a word which I hate with a passion) is funny to watch once or twice, as Fred Savage attempts to gain some time in front of the camera. The crown jewel of the extras is the Sing-A-Long. Play this Sing-A-Long on Christmas Eve, and you are guaranteed to be disowned by your family at the end of those 10 minutes.

  The main question is, ""Is it worth buying for $17?"" I'd say yes, but if you have a chance to borrow it from a friend and forget to bring it back to him or her, do it. It must be watched in any way possible.",1260230400,,3887,4.7522388059701495

I mean come on now, how could anyone pick this show apart. I find myself cracking up when I'm just trying to talk about a scene. I love Sweet Dee and her Lame & Brainless Gang, Geez, I hope this show stays on the air.
Danny Devito is awesome and with the whole bunch together and the situations they get into are hilarious. I love their uniqueness, their originality..I give it 5 stars. Even the title and the 50's type music that plays, fits..for lack of a better word. I totally blew through the 3 seasons now on to number four. Sweet. D.L.Journey",1259625600,,729,4.367647058823529
3936553,4,B002IFUCYE,"If I were to only rate the quality of the movie itself, I'd give it five stars, no question.  The Sunny cast really brought their A-game for this one and crafted a tight plot with some of the darkest gags I've seen in a while.  Set against the usually merry Christmas backdrop, the black humor shined even brighter.

However, the pricing for this DVD is a little steep for what you get, which isn't much.  There's the 43 minute movie, which is really just two episodes strung together.  And there are 3 extras, all of which are funny, none of which are very long.

I absolutely will make this DVD part of my yearly holiday tradition, but I do wish I could have done so at a slightly cheaper price.

Bottom line:  If you're a Sunny fan, buy it.  If you're on the fence, rent it first.  If you see it on sale, don't hesitate.",1259280000,3,823,4.251612903225807

That aside, the episode is a great part of the It's Always Sunny world.  All the Seinfeldian characters are in fine form making bad decisions, bickering, etc. as usual.  Why a DVD instead of broadcast - well you get a nude Danny Devito from behind, some extra swearing and a claymation montage.

Not the funniest episode ever, but not the worst, either.  If you like Sunny, you should like this DVD.",1259107200,6,545,4.6947368421052635

This Christmas special did not make me laugh until the second time I watched it.  The first time, I just sat -wowed by the wrongness of the gang's holiday traditions. A must see for fans of this off color show. ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: A Very Sunny Christmas"" could even win some new fans.

In comparison to the free weekly episodes, this is right up there in terms of humor. I had a few laugh out loud moments. I just don't understand why this was released separately and not just included in season 5. It's only one episode (43 minutes worth) and it basically costs the same as entire seasons. I wasn't really happy about that but, being a huge fan, I purchased it anyways. At least there could've been some more extras or something. The DVD doesn't include many and the ones they have aren't the greatest. Wish there could've been more bloopers and/or gag reels. Great episode and great show but loses a point because this unnecessary stand alone episode cost me extra money for no good reason.",1258848000,,808,4.5793103448275865

Otherwise, I don't think it is worth it.  It is an extra-long mediocre episode at best.  And the extra ""The Gang Singing Christmas Carols"", I don't even know what to say about that part, it is like some kind of demented 80 music video!

Do yourself a favor and purchase the DVD because there's NO reason at all to pick this up over the DVD: same picture quality!

As for the actual movie, if you're a fan of the show, you'll absolutely love this.  My only problem is it's not much longer than 2 episodes, but it's very well worth it.  Throwing rocks at trains, screwed over business partners, omni bot, stolen presents, old friends in a rut, designer hand bags full of Cheetos, Lamborginis, Frank sewed into a couch, and Charlie 'pounding off' are just a fraction of this hilarious Christmas special.

I just got this in the mail today, watched it, it's hilarious, as good as any episode.  It's 40 minutes, the length of two episodes.  The ending is a little weak, the rest is spectacular.  That's really all there is to it.  If you're willing to pay a standard DVD price for two episodes, go for it, I promise you won't be disappointed.

I was lucky enough to get it discounted with Seasons 1-4 on the deal of the day(Thanks Amazon!) so it didn't really effect me. The added violence and cursing definitely made me wish every episode could have it! They use the cursing efficiently and always to great effect.

Plenty of typical ""Sunny"" bizzarre moments but its so nice when you get done with a regular season epsiode and have a bounty of funny quotes and I can't think of one for this special.

Extended in length, profanity, inspiration, and carnage, this serves as their most fully realized, feckless episode. Given the long slack of rope that FX allows them already, you might wonder ""how much further Rob and Co. could push it?"" The answer, of course, is a Claymation elf's dong.

3936567,3,B002IFUCYE,"""A Very Sunny Christmas"" was the final episode of the fifth season of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" and in order to get past the FCC, it was released direct-to-DVD  (note: this episode was longer than a standard episode and features more profanity and violence) and takes place before Christmas time.

It's Christmas time and Mac and Charlie are decorating the pub with holiday glee but when Dennis and Dee arrive to the pub, they don't want to celebrate Christmas at all.

When they receive a call from Frank that he has a Christmas present, both Dennis and Dee are worried about what he bought himself this time.  Frank has upset his children once again when she shows up with a new sports car and carrying around an expensive Italian bag and again, the children are upset that their father is spending the money he stole from his business partner and enjoying life as if he did nothing wrong.

Upset with their father (who disappoints them during the holiday season continuously), Dennis and Dee decide to contact Frank's former business partner (the person he stole money from) and possibly Mr. Hamilton would get some payback.  As for Frank, all this time he has thought his business partner is dead.

So, Dennis and Dee pay a visit to Mr. Hamilton to see if he wants revenge but the thing is that Mr. Hamilton is a big Christian and said he has forgiven Frank.  So, Dennis and Dee come up with an idea that perhaps Mr. Hamilton can teach Frank how to be a Christian since he doesn't believe in God and thus, Mr. Hamilton who figures he can help Frank decides to help Dennis and Dee.

Meanwhile, Charlie and Mac try to celebrate Christmas and share their Christmas traditions but realizing that perhaps Christmas for them was not what they thought it was.

For Mac, he finds a Christmas video in which his family celebrates Christmas by going to someone's home and stealing their presents.  Mac, who is naive, thinks it's a Christmas tradition of going to people's home and taking their gifts, while people go to their homes and take their gifts (thus why there was never gifts at his home) and says its a holiday tradition.  But Charlie informs him there is no such holiday tradition and he and his family were actually stealing.

As for Charlie, he thinks its tradition when a Santa would come in and bring him a present and then each Santa that would come would spend time with his mother and give her money.  He asks if Mac celebrates that Christmas tradition but Mac explains to him that his mother was probably a prostitute and was having sex with the Santa's that would come to his home.

So, while Charlie and Mac try to find out how to celebrate the Christmas holiday, Dennis and Dee brings Mr. Hamilton to Frank's apartment (Frank thinks he's still dead) and Frank freaks out and thinks he's a ghost.  But both Dennis and Dee decided to show a video of how Frank destroyed Christmas for them forever.

But the night of Christmas is about each character discovering Christmas their own way and the gang trying to show Mr. Hamilton of how much Frank is an a-hole and shouldn't be forgiven and that his business partner should demand payback.

Definitely, a very sunny Christmas for the gang!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: A Very Sunny Christmas is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) with AVC@18 or higher MBPS.  It's important to note that on the Blu-ray edition, there is a ""Producer's Blu-ray Introduction"" (:48) in which Rob McElhenny and the producer read a note from Fox that the Christmas special was not shot in HD but in standard definition because it was a creative choice.  Also, explaining that the video was upconverted.

Audio is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and for the most part is a front and center-channel driven episode.  Music sounds much, much louder and cleaner but definitely not an episode where one should expect any surround or subwoofer usage.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: A Very Sunny Christmas"" comes with the following special features:

  * ""Young Charlie & Young Mac: Deleted Scenes: (2:47) Dad, Dogs, Bird - Three hilarious scenes featuring young Charlie and Young Mac talk about their personal life.  Mac talking about his dad going to prison, Mac explaining to Charlie of where he came from when he was a baby and the final deleted scene about Charlie depressed about how he is growing hair in his armpits and his bird.
  * Behind the Scenes/Making Of featurette - (7:22) The cast and crew talk about doing the Christmas special but also thinking back on their favorite Christmas moments as a child.
  * Sunny Sing-A-Long - (3:12) Featuring the cast of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" singing Christmas songs.  Featuring the gang having fun with each other while video effects show the characters with weird heads and some twisted footage.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: A Very Sunny Christmas"" is the darkest, crudest comedy Christmas special I have ever seen.  But in a way, I found it kind of twisted and fun to see a special so unlike any Christmas specials which tend to be happy and cheerful.  ""A Very Sunny Christmas"" is the total opposite of what you would expect to see for a Christmas special and I for one, never expected to see Danny DeVito nude, nor did I expect to see a Santa being mauled during the Christmas children's line at the shopping center.  So, expect to see some hilarious but also...""wow, I can't believe they did that on this episode"" type of scenes.

For those familiar with the show, the Christmas episode works well with the characters as they are misanthropes who have lived somewhat messed up lives and now trying to make it as adults.  It's like watching a Christmas special of ""Scrooge"" but the story works in reverse as the children of Frank really want to see their father get lambasted for his holiday misdeeds.  It was quite interesting to see what kind of storyline they would have for the gang when they were kids and suffice to say, it works.  It's absolutely wild and crazy but it works.

If you are trying to choose if you should go for the Blu-ray over the DVD version, the main difference is that the Blu-ray is in HD and actually brings up the graininess of the series (which is explained in a special feature) and is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio which brings out the music of the show.  If anything, those who are audiophiles will probably go for the lossless soundtrack version but for the most part, there is no exclusive content for Blu-ray over its DVD counterpart and the feature is upconverted.  Personally, I think the video and audio is marginally better than the DVD but by a small fraction.  So, don't expect awesome PQ and AQ with this Blu-ray release.

Overall, this holiday adventure for the gang of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" definitely shows us how far the cast and crew will go when they don't have to bend over for the FCC.  It's twisted, crazy and fun and definitely great for those who could care less for the usual Christmas specials.  Many fans have come to love ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" because of its writing and the fact that the main talent who are acting are the creators and writers of the show seems to help because they really have done a great job with the series thus far.  So, for those who are interested in the Blu-ray or DVD release, if you are sick of the cheerful, happy holidays style of specials all over television, then you will definitely want to give ""A Very Sunny Christmas"" a try.

Overall, though, it sort of places in the middle of the pack when compared to all of Sunny's episodes. I think very few viewers are going to say this is their favorite ep.

More important, there is no way in the world, no way at all, that it's worth even $10. Just comparing the list price of the Season 4 DVD set, this special is worth less than $8 if you count it as two episodes.

I love the show. I bought a D*ck Towel for a friend! Clearly I am willing to give these guys money. But in this case the pricing of this just reeks of make-a-quick-buck greed from FX.

PS:
In regards to the dvd vs. blu-ray for this particular release: IMO, if you have a blu-ray player, you might as well get it for the $3 extra (or whatever the difference is).  There is a *mild* improvement in *some* scenes.  But, you won't be missing out if you get the dvd version.  Either way, blu or dvd, this is a must.  I've watched EVERY episode of It's always sunny, and this is one of the best (near the end when frank's start explaining something (not giving away anything), there's about 90 seconds that are sort of like ""where'd that come from"" - but even that has a couple of moments that are pretty funny.",1258329600,4,821,4.333333333333333

The episode was only mildly funny and I watch all of their shows. The amount of full frontal and rear of Devito, coupled with the amount of animated blood flowing makes for an R rated feature in only 43 minutes, though it felt more like a South Park episode than an IASIP piece. The supplements include:

* Young Charlie & Young Mac Deleted Scenes. These kids were actually pretty funny - better than the episode here.
* Behind the scenes Making of. Lasts a few minutes and covers nothing interesting.
* Sunny Sing-A-Long. The crew making a video that looks like they were on a high of some kind.

The picture quality is one of the worst I have seen on a Blu. The DTS is actually shallow and never gets utilized except for the car driving up to the bar. Lowest common denominator with the sight gags this time (which to me their appeal has been better than that in past episodes). Two stars for a few laughs and nothing else.",1258329600,9,1173,4.274774774774775

8370862,5,B002IFUCYE,This movie is a dark Christmas comedy narcissistic and funny and its own way I personally loved it and if you have a dark sense of humor you will love it to,1513382400,,156,3.90625
8370863,5,B002IFUCYE,Kinda stupid that this one episode is as much as the whole season that it was released in and marketed on here like its something different. Scammy on you Amazon. Last episode of season 6. Not happy with my purchase. Love the show forever.,1512777600,,239,4.454545454545454

8370865,5,B002IFUCYE,How would you expect these idiots to celebrate Christmas?  You are probably way off.  It is way worse and funnier than you'd expect.  You will still laugh no matter how mean some of them are.  All you can do is pray for a Christmas miracle with them.,1497916800,,250,4.25531914893617
8370866,3,B002IFUCYE,Okay this is my favorite show BAR NONE! And I own all the seasons on dvd. But the fact that i have to buy this one episode to complete my collection is kind of ridiculous. And really I think it's idiotic but I do love the episode and this show the fact that there money hungry doesn't make the show any less awesome.... Well maybe a little but it's still my favorite by far.,1489968000,,374,4.0675675675675675
