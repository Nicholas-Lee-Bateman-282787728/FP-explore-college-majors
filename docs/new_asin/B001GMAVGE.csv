3615660,3,B001GMAVGE,The rating is not for the movie but the product. It was advertised as Multi-Format but only included a single disc with the movie. The back of the package actually refers to a bonus disc that was also not included. Actually loved the movie and already had the DVD but it didn't take advantage of my HD TV so ordered the Blu-ray.,1520640000,,328,4.306451612903226

It was obviously updated from the original series but if you're looking for a lot of the original material you may be disappointed.

3615683,4,B001GMAVGE,"Well, that's up to you to decide for yourself, but as a fan of the original series starring Don Adams and Barbara Feldon, this movie was a lot better than I expected.

Obviously the series in the 60's is a classic, and probably many fans would think what I am saying is sacrilege, but Steve Carell is a comic genius in his own right, and although he has a different take on the Agent 86 character than Adams did so perfectly back in the day, Carell is hilariously funny in this film, and his supporting cast of Anne Hathaway (Agent 99) and a new character The Rock (Agent 23), are great comic foils, as well as funny in different ways as well.

This film holds to the campy humor of the original series as well, but what I like about the new ""Get Smart"" movie is the fact that a lot of the humor expands the boundaries of the original, and there are also some dramatic moments as well, for example, when Agent 86 has to deal with the disappointment of again being denied that sought-after promotion to field agent, he so badly wanted.

Lot of twists and turns, great action sequences, and a well-written script.  Again, if you are a diehard fan of the 60's series, you will not be seeing a duplicate of that here, but then again, this is new century, so that is to be expected.

I'm actually surprised there was never a sequel to this movie, but that has more to do with the box office than anything else I'm sure.

Great way to spend a couple hours, if you want to just relax, laugh, and munch on some popcorn.",1510185600,,1511,4.28421052631579

3615686,5,B001GMAVGE,"Although Get Smart has plenty of easy laughs in it, there are many places where the laughs are rather subtle and you have to both be paying attention and get what they are spoofing. Those laughs are probably the biggest if you spot them.

What can you say about Steve Carell? In remakes of this type it is easy for the movie actor to come up short of the legend created out of the popular TV role. (Will Smith as James West anyone?) As much as I enjoyed Don Adams in the TV series, Steve Carell one up's him and is a better Maxwell Smart than Adams was.

Anne Hathaway obviously studied Barbara Feldon's Agent 99 quite a bit, because there are lines in the movie where you could swear that a younger Feldon had been plugged in. She's spot on in the role.

The movie pays homage to Don Adam's most famous repeat bits without overdoing it one bit. The story is engaging, and the action is very well done, although you'll struggle to recognize that because they don't let up on the comedy accelerator even in the middle of action scenes that would be the most tense in any other film.

The Blu-ray redition of the film is a delight to watch. I don't go through special features often, so I won't comment on those, altho we did watch the outtake/gag reel and it was worth the time spent to watch it ... twice.

We have now watched this film several times as we played it for ourselves, and then various sets of family and friends. We enjoy it just as much with each repeated viewing ... a solid accomplishment for any film, and even more so for a comedy.

Obviously, if you like comedies this is highly recommended. If you were a fan of the Get Smart TV series, its must see.",1508976000,,1671,4.288888888888889

I sent three to relatives as a ""hey, let's keep in touch"" gift, and they loved the it. Another relative begged me to send one! And if you loved the original Get Smart, you'll probably love the movie. It starts with Max as an analyst, explains his improbable move to agent, and does a fairly faithful job paying homage to many of the TV show's original themes and tropes. While Max and 99 are the main characters, it is truly an ensemble effort, so there really aren't any thin spots from character myopia. I don't know if it was scripted or improvised, but watch for the best line: ""Thanks for jumping.""",1492560000,,756,4.5661764705882355

It is good on it's as a comedy with a good amount of action it too.  Which surprised me.  As a comedy it is way better then the Austin Powers movies.  But Steve Carell who hasn't been one of my favorites.  Just doesn't pull off Maxwell Smart.  Anne Hathaway who is one of my favorites does a very good and sexy 99.  And about the last thirty minutes of the movie turns into a straight ahead action movie.  I'll take the t.v. show over this anytime.  But all in all this isn't bad,",1491350400,,596,4.060344827586207
3615712,5,B001GMAVGE,"I watched this film Get Smart this past Friday night shortly after getting back to my apartment after a shift at work that went fine. However, this film made me laugh and Im elated to have bought this film. The first reason; Steve Carrell as Maxwell Smart and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. Max Smart  and Agent 99 end up initially meeting each other by chance and working with each other through dangerous situations that break their initial tension. The scenes involving Max Smart and Agent 99 on an airplane involving Dalip (Dalip Singh) comedically foreshadow some of the other adventures that they unexpectedly get into. Dwayne Johnson features as Agent 23, the type of employee that Max Smart initially seems to secretly aspire towards for justified reasons. Terry Crews plays Agent 91 who is friends with Larabee (a Control Worker). There are also  cameos by Bill Murray and James Caan. Max Smart expresses willingness to go on some dangerous missions involving Siegfried (Terrence Stamp) after successfully losing much weight. However, The Chief (Alan Arkin) initially prefers Smart to stay in the office. Of course, there are other characters who also contribute to the plot points. Some of the location andor pop culture references in the Get Smart film; Washington D.C., Moscow, the song Aint No Other Man by Christina Aguilera, Moskva River Russia, Smolensk Russia, some bakery in Moscow, Homeland Security, Disney Hall Los Angeles California. I also liked how the movie ended with the song 4 Minutes by Madonna feat. Justin Timberlake and Timbaland.",1491091200,,1558,5.08203125

3615716,5,B001GMAVGE,"Director Peter Segal has done it again by making the funniest movie of the decade with smashing lead actors such as Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson, and Alan Arkin. From the comedic film Anger Management in 2003 to the heartbreaking romcom, 50 First Dates in 2004 (both of which star Adam Sandler), who would have thought that he would get another hit movie? Peter Segal leads the actors through many comedic struggles such as a harpoon hidden in a pocketknife, uncomfortable dance competitions, and social situations on a plane with a plot that was cohesive and understandable and had each event leading into the next. By doing this, the movie became much more enjoyable to sit back and enjoy. The pace was perfect, leaving time for me to fully laugh at the comedy and feel the full effect of the action scenes. By elaborating on the character development and how those characters impacted the plot and script, director Peter Segal is able to make a laughable, but heartfelt movie for all ages.
 The star of the show is Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell), who is a socially awkward desk worker, which sounds an awful lot like another role he is famous for playing (Michael Scott in The Office). The originality may be lackingdue to the similarities of the two rolesbut the way he plays Maxwell Smart is perfection with just the right combination of socially awkward and intelligent that each word he says has you cringing and laughing at the same time. By the time the movie is over, your stomach will be hurting from laughing so hard. What is even better though, is that Steve Carells character actually develops. He starts the movie alone, with only his work to keep him company, always wishing for something he cannot geta promotion to field agent. As the movie grows, so does his character, and you begin to see him branch out and stretch his comfort zone from becoming an agent to forming a relationship with a woman.
 Maxs partner, Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), plays the experienced woman who always has a plan, which was perfect for Ms. Hathaway because her acting style was complex and intricate in the emotion. She played the role of dramatic-and-mysterious-secret-spy very well through her use of confidence and acrobatic skills. She also seems to know just when she is pushing her audience to the side of disliking her for being rude to Max, because she throws in some heartfelt moments with him that will having you awww-ing in the end. By showing both sides of herself, the audience is able to see that she is more than just a heartless spy and instead that she cares about Max and others around her. This implies that her character also goes through some major character development and learns, once again, how to be close enough with people to trust them. The complexity of both characters shows how careful the directorPeter Segalhad to be to craft this film through all stages of it: writing, casting, and shooting.
 The movie overall showed huge leaps in the action-comedy genre. By creating the fast paced action scenes and incorporating perfectly timed jokes and sarcasm into the already extraordinary script, the director is able to create a movie for all ages. He is able to go the extra mile through extreme close-up shots and super corny theme music which only serve to add to the fake suspense and comedy of the overall movie. The movie is PG-13 but if your kids are old enough, this movie is definitely one to watch with the family. Next time you're all sitting down, just hanging out, turn on Get Smart because by the time its over, youll be closer and all of your hearts will be lighter",1487808000,,3618,4.730586370839936

3615759,4,B001GMAVGE,"As a fan of the original Get Smart series with Don Adams and Barbara Feldon, I think it could've been even less funny and I'm would have still enjoyed it. I love the humor and the tone of the originals and this movie tries to stay with both, at least as much as you would expect from a mainstream movie that's trying to also be enjoyable for people who have never seen the original series. The opening sequence is there as well as the closing. There is also some good stunt work that is done in a skydiving scene and in a car chase scene, among other places. For fans of the original, you will really enjoy this, probably wishing for more references but be satisfied with what they did. If you have never seen the original (like my wife), this is a great way to Get Smart to what the original series was all about with two great stars of the Big Screen. A very good job, as you would expect from Steve Carell and a great job by Anne Hathaway, whom I think is in even better shape than she normally is for this movie, doing a few little stunts that make you say ""wow go Anne!"" The only caveat is I believe the Amazon rental version is not the exact same as the theatrical version, having seen both there was a part or two I remember from the theaters that was not in this version, but not enough to take away from the movie or be a big issue. After we watch the movie they were links to IMDb data on goofs, trivia, etc. which was nice to read right after watching the movie. Also, at the end of the credits it said For Don Adams and another star. While it would've been even greater to see that at the very beginning of the credits it was a nice touch. A big thank you to Mel Brooks Buck Henry, Don Adams and the rest of the original think tanks and brilliance that made it such a great show, the current writers and stars and for God putting them here when he did. Get Smart and God Bless! :)",1467590400,,1892,4.1024258760107815

3615779,1,B001GMAVGE,"Maybe I'm just getting older and more cynical, but I can't help but feel like I've seen this exact same film already a dozen or so times. Let me try to recap the formula:
- a bumbling idiot of a male hero who deadpans through all of his mishaps
- a beautiful, strong, independent female lead who is otherwise perfect, makes few mistakes and is the smarter, faster, stronger of the pair.
- the old, crabby chief
- a contrived plot that involves (spoiler alert!) one of their very own agents that turns out to be the bad guy

And so on.

I didn't find this particularly funny at all. A few sequences were more cringe-worthy than anything, such as the needle gun impaling Carell's character over and over again, or the other nameless character who is repeatedly stapled in the forehead (which in actuality would be very painful.) The writing is predictable, the acting cold and boring, and this had me more nostalgic for the original series, and if anything more bitter at Hollywood for taking beloved originals and ruining them with terrible remakes. I doubt the trend will stop anytime soon.",1457049600,,1090,4.642487046632124

3615909,4,B001GMAVGE,"On the plus side, this Blu-ray edition of ""Get Smart"" contains not one, not two, but three separate discs!  Warners went whole hog in the extras department, providing a digital copy and a ""Get Smart"" DVD game.  On the negative side, the high-definition movie disc does not contain a high-definition audio track, only regular Dolby Digital.  More on this in a moment.

In the meantime, let me talk about the movie.  I've said this before but it bears repeating:  Comedy is a funny business.  What makes one person laugh uproariously may totally bore another.  With the exception of a few outright slapstick gags, the new ""Get Smart"" is a pretty tame affair, most of the jokes done deadpan.  For example, Maxwell Smart is left standing on the sidewalk in front of a store, having just been dissed by the beautiful Agent 99 the first time they meet.  He's staring after her in dismay when a fellow from the store pushes a cart over his foot.  Smart doesn't overtly react.  We can see the pain in his eyes for this second insult.  ""Am I invisible?"" he asks the world, and quietly limps off.  It's a melancholy humor that would have made Chaplin proud.

Warner Bros.' 2008 remake of the 1960s' ""Get Smart"" television series attempts to reference and pay tribute to as much as possible that we remember about the old show (which itself was a spoof of the Bond series), while not being a direct imitation.  Star Steve Carell bears a passing resemblance to TV's Don Adams in height, hair, and build, but Carell tries not to copy him.  Although you'll find the old catch phrases here, like ""Sorry about that, Chief,"" ""Missed it by that much,"" ""The old....trick,"" and ""Would you believe....,"" Carell goes out of his way not to use Adams's familiar voice inflections.  Thus, with Carell they sound almost like throwaway lines, which might disappoint old fans but proves the new show really is striving for something different, while not forsaking the past altogether.

Likewise, Carell's Maxwell Smart is still a secret agent for CONTROL, but he's not the bumbling idiot he used to be.  He's actually a pretty bright fellow who just happens to be out of his league, having just been promoted out of desperation from persnickety CONTROL analyst to full-fledged field agent because there's no one else available.  So, yeah, although he's still bumbling around doing goofy things, it isn't because he's too dumb to figure things out but because he simply doesn't know what he's doing.

There's not much of a plot in this updated ""Get Smart,"" which is appropriate to the nature of the picture.  Like its television predecessor, the story is merely a line on which to hang the gags and set up the repartee among the characters.  In this case, the first third or more of the movie provides a background on how Smart got to be where he is.  In the old TV show, Smart simply showed up full blown:  He was a field agent, a spy, for the U.S. espionage agency CONTROL, and his girlfriend, Agent 99, was a fellow agent.  But perhaps in anticipation of the movie version being the first in a proposed series, we get some history:  We learn that Smart was not always a field agent.  As I've said, at the beginning of the movie, he is a CONTROL analyst; he works behind a desk preparing data and crunching numbers, and he has no romance with 99.  It is only when the evil KAOS organization infiltrates CONTROL headquarters and compromises almost all of its regular agents that CONTROL has to enlist Smart as a field agent, pairing him with their only other viable agent, 99.  Thus, Smart is pressed into service and thrown together with Agent 99, like it or not.  Together, Smart and 99 must track down the perpetrators of the CONTROL break-in, which takes them to colorful locations throughout Europe and America.

The cast measures up to the task.  Carell seems perfectly fit for the role of Maxwell Smart, physically and temperamentally.  He is the inept Smart, true, yet he is never the complete fool.  As Agent 99 we have Anne Hathaway, who is also well cast, although she is noticeably younger than Carell by some twenty-odd years.  The discrepancy is neatly covered in the film, though, so don't worry about it.  She's cool, calm, beautiful, charming, and as funny as anyone else in the film.  As the handsome and dashing Agent 23 we get Dwayne Johnson, also perfect in the role of an ego-inflated world's greatest superspy.  Best of all, though, is Alan Arkin as the Chief.  The actor has always been funny, and his character's barely contained rage is a highlight of the movie.  Peter Segal (""Naked Gun 33 1/3,"" ""Anger Management,"" ""The Longest Yard"") directs the film in a pleasantly amiable, low-key style.

A few other actors don't fare as well with their characters, however.  Terrence Stamp plays the villainous Siegfried (another famous name from the old TV show), and he seems in a different picture altogether, playing the part so seriously you'd think he was in a Bourne adventure.  Then there's James Caan, who plays a blockheaded President of the United States so broadly that his behavior seems at odds with the more subdued humor of Carell, Hathaway, and Arkin.  And poor Bill Murray gets relegated to a tree, a cameo as Agent 13, the fellow who is always hanging out in unlikely places.  We're more or less just supposed to say, ""Oh, look, that's Bill Murray, isn't it?,"" and then he's gone.

Anyway, the bottom line for any comedy is whether or not it's funny.  This will, of course, vary from viewer to viewer, but for me ""Get Smart"" is very funny.  Not funny outrageous or funny gross in the Farrelly brothers or Austin Powers manner, but funny cute, funny nice, funny mild.  Call it what you will, it made me laugh more than almost any other film this year.  That's the biggest compliment I can pay it.

Video:
I saw this movie twice, once in regular film projection and again in a different theater in digital projection.  Both times it looked unnaturally soft, and then it occurred to me to find out how it was shot.  As I suspected, the filmmakers made it mostly in digital (Panavision Genesis cameras).  So, don't expect the movie to look any better in high definition than it did in a motion-picture theater (it should look about the same, and it does).  However, do expect it to look significantly better than its standard-def counterpart, which looks positively blurry and dull by comparison.

The oddity about this Blu-ray release is that Warner Bros. went to all the trouble and expense of providing not only the movie disc but a digital copy disc and a ""Kaos Control"" game disc, three discs in a special keep case, yet they went with a single-layer BD25 for the film itself, which offers only a regular, lossy Dolby Digital soundtrack.  I'm sure the studio knows what it's doing and figures that buyers are more interested in bells and whistles than in improved audio quality, but as a reviewer I'm obliged to make note of the fact.

Anyway, the picture and colors in this 1080p, VC-1 Blu-ray, 1.85:1 ratio transfer vary from scene to scene, just as they do in the standard-def version, and just as they did in a theater.  Sometimes they look natural and glistening with realistic vitality, and other times they look overly contrasted, glossy, or too dark.  I suspect the filmmakers used a variety of cameras because one most often notices the softness, and then, all of a sudden and from out of the blue, the whole picture can look sharp as a tack.  I dunno.

Let me put it another way:  The picture on the standard-definition disc looks like a very good videotape; the picture on the Blu-ray looks like a very good standard-definition disc, which is about what we should have expected, given its source.

Audio:
Yes, the disc provides only an ordinary Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, not a lossless codec like TrueHD, odd for a movie with so many gunshots, explosions, airplanes, and the like.  The DD 5.1, while adequate for the job, will hardly knock anybody's socks off (if that's your idea of good time).  The best part about the sound comes during the Warner Bros. opening logo, which displays quite a lot of surround.  After those few seconds, the soundtrack exhibits only occasions outbursts of noise that might impress a listener.  Most of the audio comes from the front speakers, with a few gunshots and automobile sounds rebounding in the rear channels, along with a little (very little) musical ambience enhancement.  There is a reasonably strong bass during the film's periodic explosions, a fairly good dynamic impact, and an adequately quick transient response.  Still, there aren't as many such moments as you might expect.  By and large, the soundtrack reproduces dialogue from the center speaker and a front-oriented musical score.  The audio sounds like that which might accompany any good made-for-television movie.

Extras:
Disc one of this three-disc Blu-ray edition contains the movie, plus a number of extras, most of which appeared in the standard-definition Two-Disc Special Edition.  Probably of greatest importance is an optional ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" (or ""Smart Takes"").  Whenever a telephone-booth screen pops up, you have the choice of watching an alternate take of the scene you're in.  It's another way for the filmmakers to provide deleted scenes, this time in a more clever fashion than usual.

Next, there is a ten-minute featurette, ""The Right Agent for the Right Job:  Behind-the-Scenes Training,"" on the casting of Carell and Hathaway.  Then, there is a six-minute featurette, ""Max in Moscow!,"" on the film's location shooting.  After that is a three-and-a-half-minute featurette, ""Language Lessons:  Spotlight on Linguistics,"" with Carell being silly; a five-and-half-minute gag reel of flubs; and a three-minute sneak peek at a direct-to-DVD spin-off, ""Spying on Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control.""  In addition, there's ""The Old I Hid It in the Movie Trick,"" nine minutes, wherein the movie's Bruce and Lloyd help you discover where director Peter Segal concealed references to the old TV series; the references will be pretty obvious to any fan of the show.  Lastly, there's ""The Vomit Reel,"" five minutes of additional footage of the film's vomit scene.

Beyond that, disc one provides twenty-eight scene selections; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two contains a standard-definition digital copy of the film compatible with iTunes and Windows media devices.  And disc three contains a DVD game called ""Get Smart:  KAOS CONTROL.""  The game takes you through a series of assignments from training to field work, and it's a good example of why game companies don't make more games for disc players.

Warners packages the three discs in a special keep case with a center insert, the case further enclosed in a slipcover with a holographic picture on the front.

Parting Thoughts:
Hollywood, always quick to imitate anything they think will make a buck, has given us no end of television remakes, from ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" to ""Sgt. Bilko,"" ""The Honeymooners,"" and Speed Racer.""  Most of these retreads are pretty bad, with only an occasional ""Addams Family"" recapturing the old magic.  However, in the case of ""Get Smart"" I think the movie will satisfy fans of the old TV series as well as please new audiences unfamiliar with the old show.  ""Get Smart"" is funny, clever, nostalgic, up-to-date, and...well...smart.  And no one could have pulled off the title role better than Carell.",1433376000,,11574,4.868609406952965

3616019,4,B001GMAVGE,"This is a fun movie -- it's as silly as the old TV program, except that the Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway characters have a little more depth than Don Adams' and Barbara Feldon's characters, maybe because of the difference in movies vs. TV sitcoms, and the humor of the 1960's vs. the 2000's.  There are less gadgets in the movie, and it seems  that Maxwell Smart's main motivation is having his love accepted by Agent 99, which I don't remember in the TV show.

The one amazing aspect of the movie, in my opinion, is the producers', director's, and casts' decision to play the dance scene in the favor of the lone overweight guest.  They could have played it with her as the joke, instead, she ended being seen in better light than all the snobby, beautiful women at the ball.  I think this was a brave way to play the scene, and that it was carried very well by Steve Carell and Lindsay Hollister, the actress playing Max's dance partner.",1411689600,,941,4.4476744186046515

I was fairly surprised and quite pleased about Carell and Hathaway's performance.  Alan Arkin also played a passible Chief.  This was fun to watch and likely worth seeing a few times.",1401926400,,395,4.585714285714285

I used to watch the old re-runs of the original series and just remember loving it. The movie itself was entertaining and there were some good laughs. It's enjoyable. Oscar worthy? No. A couple of hours of mindless fun? Absolutely.,1394582400,,343,4.548387096774194

Steve Carell is just awesome as always.  And having Anne Hathaway in there only added to it.  The two of them did a great job as well as all of the other people.
Our kids have to watch this at least twice a year and the wife and I always are right there to join them.  Its a great family movie. I was happy to hear that there might be a Get Smart 2 coming out in the next year of so.  I hope it has the same people.",1389139200,,640,3.7388059701492535

Not every scene nailed it like that one did, but for the most part, Steve Carrell and Anne Hathaway make this such a FUN MOVIE that it is very worth watching, especially if you are a Carrell fan.  Maxwell Smart is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier, but he is the best researcher CONTROL has!  But when the agents are attacked, they need everybody in the field that they can spare, meaning Max gets his chance.  He is paired up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway).  If you liked the Get Smart tv show, you will LOVE this take off!",1382400000,,642,4.229508196721311
3616133,4,B001GMAVGE,"Just saw this again for the second time and the reaction is the same - an enjoyable film that pays commendable homage to the original TV show, while fitting it in to modern times. The key is of course Steve Carell, who is a likeable Max. He is suitably alike in appearance and I think he recaptures the lovely mix of incompetence and bravery that made Agent 86 so wonderful. I liked the back story and I liked how some of the familiar gags got a run. The story was fine, with a decent mix of action and comedy. Indeed, there were some great scenes that made me laugh out loud. The supporting actors do a good job too. Everyone seemed keen to do the original honour and though this lead to the film feeling slightly restrained in some ways I felt it was a good effort and I hope that plans for a sequel bear fruit.",1381190400,,813,4.1847133757961785
3616134,5,B001GMAVGE,"I love this movie, probably my favorite part was the scene with Steve carell  trying to use the Swiss army knife. Anyway, really funny movie I would highly recommend it, but I would say the suitable age for children to see it is 9+  bye!",1380672000,,237,4.2444444444444445
3616135,3,B001GMAVGE,"Get Smart the TV show was known for its zaniness and Cold War thrillers. The first third of this movie had some hilarious tributes to the old TV show. I loved seeing the movie poke fun at ridiculous concepts like the cone of silence. However, it loses its way after that. The plot isn't very original - terrorists threaten to kill the president - which would be fine if the film were funny. Some of the humor works, particularly when it plays on the sexual tension between Steve Carrell and Anne Hathaway. But a lot of it falls flat. Get Smart humor is more like zany Rodney Dangerfield type humor. This movie lost a bit too much energy halfway through. It's not horrible for a remake, but doesn't do the original justice.",1380672000,,722,4.4772727272727275

3616146,5,B001GMAVGE,"Like the original five seasons it's a romance, updated for modern feminism.

The original Get Smart followed the cycle of traditional men and women

1.  Woman sends guy on quest.

2.  The guy, being average, sometimes screws up.

3.  The woman shows the guy that she's satisfied with him.

Barbara Feldon was loved by every male in America for always reaching (3), and that cycle could repeat forever.

(Without (3), it's nagging; without there being any man in particular addressed, it's feminism.)

On the current Get Smart:

Hathaway is the competent feminist, and Carell the rookie wins her with deadpan flirting and flashes of unexpected ability.

It's great dialogue, worth replaying several times.  No further surprises but there are expressions to pick up at favorite parts.  Hathaway is excellent.  The alternate scenes were well chosen for omission, and they went with the right ones.

The car chase was a little long, if you're replaying it.

The reason that the dance scene, amusing on its own, fits in so well is that the Russian woman represents 99.

Finally, the ""Two disc"" version at a dollar more is a better deal for the extra outtakes and cut scenes (It's actually 3 discs, for some reason), though they edited in the correct choices in all places but one.  I'd have put in the ""stop smiling"" scene.",1376438400,,1318,4.829596412556054

3616163,4,B001GMAVGE,"""Get Smart"" is great! This is how the story goes: Maxwell Smart is on a mission to thwart the latest plot for world domination by the evil crime syndicate known as KAOS. When the headquarters of U.S. spy agency Control is attacked and the identities of its agents compromised, the Chief has no choice but to promote his ever-eager analyst Maxwell Smart, who has always dreamt of working in the field alongside stalwart superstar Agent 23. Smart is partnered instead with the only other agent whose identity has not been compromised: the lovely-but-lethal veteran Agent 99. As Smart and 99 get closer to unraveling KAOS' master plan--and each other--they discover that key KAOS operative Siegfried and his sidekick Shtarker are scheming to cash in with their network of terror. Given little field experience and even less time, Smart--armed with nothing but a few spy-tech gadgets and his unbridled enthusiasm--must defeat KAOS if he is to save the day. The cast led by Steve Carell (as Maxwell Smart), Anne Hathaway (as Agent 99), Dwayne Johnson (as Agent 23), and Alan Arkin (as The Chief) is great! The directing by Peter Segal (who also directed ""The Longest Yard"" (2005), ""50 First Dates"" (2004), ""Anger Management"" (2003), all of which star Adam Sandler, & ""Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"" (2000) is great! The story and screenplay by Tom J. Astle & Matt Ember (who also wrote the story and screenplay to ""Failure To Launch"" (2006), based on characters by Mel Brooks & Buck Henry, is great! The music by Trevor Rabin (who also did the music to ""National Treasure"" (2004) & ""National Treasure 2: Book Of Secrets"" (2007) is excellent! The cinematography by Dean Semler (who also did the cinematography to ""The Longest Yard"" & ""Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"") is great! The film editing by Richard Pearson (who also did the film editing to the upcoming ""Quantum Of Solace"" (2008) is great!

The last thing I'm going to say about Get Smart, is that I appreciate how the jokes aren't too unbelievably inappropriate. That isn't to say that you should let your ten year old watch it, just that the PG-13 rating is pretty accurate, and you don't have to worry too much about fast forwarding the sketchy parts.

It's alway tough to tackle a role that is so closely associated to another, but Carell has done a good job.  I don't want to trash Steve Martin, but I feel he has turned the Pink Panther movies into just typical Steve Martin movie and that's not a bad thing, but he doesn't capture the role of Clouseau like Peter Sellers.  I make this comparison because I think Carell was a good fit for Smart and I was dissappointed.

I know I may get some negative votes for my Martin comments, but it's not really meant to be a criticism because he's made the Pink Panther his own and has not copied Sellers.",1362441600,,725,4.18705035971223

I am old enough to remember the original series, but I wasn't really expecting much more of it in this 'remake' other than the names and some iconic scenes, and I was right.  The relationship between Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 has been changed to open hostility, there are loads of extraneous characters that add almost nothing of benefit and in fact detract from the story, and most importantly, Steve Carell just doesn't bring the character to life the way Don Adams did.  We can't decide if Carell's an idiot or a genius, but with Adams, there was no question.  Anne Hathaway does a good job with Barbara Feldon's role as Agent 99, but the chemistry between the two is all off. The dialogue is rarely witty, and the humor basically silly physical humor.  Certainly Don Adams was a great physical comedian, but I wish this Get Smart had gotten smarter; I miss Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's writing.

3616211,2,B001GMAVGE,"Based on the 1960s television series, ""Get Smart"" is about a totally ineffective secret operative of the government.

The good:  I have never seen ""The Office"" so Steve Carell was a totally unknown quantity to me.  He had a big shadow overhanging him in the form of Don Adams' Maxwell Smart (from the original show).  Unfair as it is to compare the two, ""Get Smart"" is not like a Shakespeare play where anyone can put a different stamp on Hamlet.  The ghost of Adams' Maxwell Smart must have been difficult to exorcise.  Fortunately, Carell is good enough to bring a whole new take on the character and make it his own.  He is not doing a cheap Don Adams' impersonation.  And his Smart is quite effective, in his own way.

Anne Hathaway is a good 99, a bit more competent than she was in the original series (where everyone in CONTROL was wacky).  She was given a secret back story she can reveal in order to give her a scene where she really has to act and evoke sympathy.  The moment ""Get Smart"" fans were waiting for, her first ""Oh, Max!"" was nicely timed in the pacing of the movie and was delivered flawlessly.  I liked her 99 better than Barbara Feldon (whose acting in the series was always more on the glamor side).

The movie is littered with funny comedy moments and comedic turns, one of them the cameo of the original Siegfried, Bernie Kopell.  The way ""Get Smart"" does its opening and closing with the secret doors allowed it to be familiar and, using special effects, at the same time good way to introduce the viewer into the modern day's CONTROL.  THEY EVEN HAD A PHONE BOOTH.  It must be the last in captivity.  They probably should have updated that idea.

Unfortunately, scattered moments, however good they are, do not add up to an entertaining movie.  Since the human body can laugh only so long, every comedy movie must have its more serious moments.  In the silent days, great comedians like Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd sprinkled the laughs in up front while building to comedic climaxes.  ""Get Smart"" follows the pattern of many modern comedy movies that plant their flags early on by front-loading lots of laughs, then going into action/suspense mode near the end.

The laughs in ""Get Smart"" do not come evenly.  A movie like ""Airplane"" threw a lot at the audience.  If the audience didn't laugh at one thing, the next thing was already heading for them.  ""Get Smart"" frankly doesn't throw that much.  A lot of the movie, such as Smart's dance routine with an overweight lady, is simply a wasted time.  There's a lot of wasted celluloid in this movie.

Alan Arkin does not work as the Chief.  Arkin can be extremely funny -- watch ""The In-Laws"" -- but the point of the Chief in the tv series was that he got laughs by being extremely serious.  More than a decade before the makers of ""Airplane"" cast Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Peter Graves and Leslie Nielsen in a comedy where they were hilarious by being their deadpan selves, ""Get Smart"" cast the po-faced Edward Platt, who got laughs by being ultra-serious.  Alan Arkin is a good actor with a solid credentials.  But at some point in his career he, like Gene Wilder, decided to go into high gear and stay there.  If you want to see a perfectly subtle and nuanced performance by Arkin, go back to the climax of ""The Russians are Coming!  The Russians are Coming!""  He plays the Chief more like a middle-aged Yossarian.  Perhaps they should have cast Terence Stamp as the Chief, giving the same effective performance he gives here as the bad guy.

Terence Stamp's performance really is too good for this movie.  Like all villains in the movies these days, he is white with an English accent.  English actors make the best villains because they are often classically trained, and they take whatever they do seriously (I can't imagine an American actor in ""Star Wars"" playing Obi-Wan or Grand Moff Tarkin without a twinkle in his eye that says, ""We both know this is rubbish but I need the money.""  Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing tackled their hero/baddie roles with the same aplomb they'd have brought to Shakespeare;  or, with Peter Cushing, driving a stake through a vampire).  Of course, one wonders why a guy named Siegfried has an English accent.  In the tv series, Siegfried was just as incompetent as Max in his own way, and he spoke with an outrageous pseudo-German accent.

Stamp could give this same performance as a white, English-accented terrorist in a serious action flick against Stallone, Willis, Will Smith, &c.  Perhaps they felt they needed a bona fide threat to make ""Get Smart"" watchable, when more laughs would have done the trick.  But more laughs would have meant more work all around.

So they cut a movie to the run-of-the-mill action flick pattern and grafted Agents 86 and 99 onto it.  They peppered it with a few laughs, ran their few really good and original ideas up a flagpole, let it simmer according to the recipe, and then served it up luke-warm. Despite solid performances by Carell and Hathaway, that's what ""Get Smart"" amounts to.

I saw this movie for the first time just weeks following a genuine foreign relations debacle, where a real president, in a series of circumstances leading to a genuine attack by terrorists on several foreign embassies and the murder of an American ambassador in Libya, brushed off half or more of his intelligence briefings (probably to hit the golf courses) and spiked the football about having sent an assassination squad after an actual terrorist. So while watching ""Get Smart"" I was reminded that the world still is a treacherous place;  and when ****-ups like Obama can grease their way into the White House, that fish rots from its head and intelligence services do become buffoons.

It's good that Americans can still laugh in the face of horror.  But ""Get Smart"" wastes too much time.  I applaud its attempt not to slavishly copy an old tv show we've seen before, the way Blake Edward kept trying to keep the Pink Panther alive (ending up with movies just as dead as Peter Sellers).

Rather than pretending this movie was ""Get Smart"" they might just as well have titled it something else, given 86 and 99 different appellations, called the Chief and CONTROL and Siegfried by different names, and had just as valid a show.  And it might have been better.

Still, there is Hathaway's ""Oh, Max!""",1349222400,,6351,4.672072072072072

3616216,1,B001GMAVGE,"Watching the film, ""Get Smart"" (2008) reminded me of two earlier big budget comedy films, ""It's a Mad, Mad etc. World"" (1963) directed by Stanley Kramer and ""1941"" (1979) directed by Steven Spielberg.  Both movies had large casts of talented performers, had a ton of money thrown at them and, for the most part simply laid there failing to fulfill their primary goals: to make audiences laugh.  Neither director had had very much experience in the comedy field, a serious handicap, which brings me immediately to Woody Allen, the most talented writer of comedy over the past fifty years, who, initially at least, had no experience in directing a motion picture.  The least of his films --  of those that he both wrote and directed -- leave both of the above films in the dust being successful and often brilliant achievements in screen comedy.  Steven Spielberg recalled the preview of ""1941"" at a local theater in Los Angeles.  ""We stood in the lobby and the audience became quieter and quieter.  I went in and looked and several people had their hands over their ears.  I knew we were in trouble.""  Today, the most successful comedy films, i.e. films that are actually funny, are those written and directed by the Coen brothers.

I didn't watch many of the television episodes of ""Get Smart"" as I had largely given up watching commercial television programs by that time, but I had seen Don Adams perform many times and he was an undoubted expert as a standup comedian, having funny material and flawless comedic timing, without which, the program ""Get Smart"" would never have been the success that it was.  Mel Brooks, Buck Henry, Don Adams and many others shared writing credit for the series.

Steve Carell who plays the lead in the film ""Get Smart"" does not impress me as a professional comedian.  I'm not certain what he is, but the one thing that he is not is funny.  Likewise the director, Peter Segal, shows little of the comedic abilities of Woody Allen or the Coen brothers with the result that nearly all of the attempts at screen comedy misfire here.  The director apparently decided to substitute fancy special effects in lieu of competant comedy writing.  The mistakes that are made in the film are numerous:  One example is Carell talking amorously to someone off camera, whom we are initially led to believe, must be an attractive woman.  But the shot of Carell talking runs too long without a cut which prematurely tells us that he is not talking to a woman.  When the cut finally does occur it turns out to be a cute little dog which does not play funny because the joke has already been sprung ahead of time.  In the trade this is known as telegraphing your punch line.  This is the fault of both the director and editor and the film is generally clumsy in this regard.  The scene in the airplane restroom with the darts misfiring is mildly funny the first time, but it goes on and on and simply becomes painful to watch.  The ""comic"" dance number with the overweight girl is both cruel and crude.  The joke about the poison capsule lays an egg due to inept writing.  In the hands of Woody Allen, this would have been written to be funny.

As the film goes on (and it does go on -- and on!) it becomes less of a comedy (if that were possible) and more of a high-tech actioner indicating that apparently no one involved had a clear idea of what the film was actually intended to be, the final 20 minutes essentially being an incoherent mess of special effects and chases.

For those of us old enough to remember the ""Fibber McGee & Molly"" radio show: when Fibber McGee would spring a joke that got groans instead of a laugh, Molly would say,  ""T'ain't funny, McGee.""  That pretty much sums up this film.",1342224000,,3723,4.590015128593041

Well, all the slapstick, goofy stuff, and Maxwell Smart's egotistical pettiness are there, but they've been through the ""sensitive male"" 1980s, Jenny Craig, high-budget effects and stunts, and I don't know what-all. Going through all that transformed them.

I almost split a gut laughing when the discussion turned to the state of her ovaries (Hathaway is a young-looking 26 as of this writing, a fact that needs a little explaining away in the movie, and I assume that they're just fine). Then, when the big, knockdown fight near the end turned into a hugfest, well that was way too Californian for me even though I'm Californian - but only a little, and that will get better real soon I promise.

It was all I remembered, but more in every direction - including some mild potty humor and silly edges toward nudity that would never have worked back when the good guys could still smoke. Enough time has passed, and they acknowledge that from the start, that it can all be new again. And it's a hoot.

3616239,4,B001GMAVGE,"Would you believe that it's a pretty funny movie for a casual evening's entertainment? If you like Mel Brooks style slapstick, that's exactly what it is.

These folks took a page from the Mission:Impossible crew on how to translate an old TV show to a decent movie:

1. Have a decent budget for a good script and good effects.

2. Hire some A-list actors.

3. Respect the things that made the original special.

4. If the theme song is a recognizable, well-composed classic, keep it.

I'm not really a fan of Steve Carell, but he's pitch-perfect as Maxwell Smart. His deadpan delivery is spot on.

I am fans of Anne Hathaway and Alan Arkin, and they both turn in good efforts. I've like Anne since The Princess Diaries, and Alan since he captured the enigmatic Yossarian in Catch 22 (forty years ago!).

Ex-athlete actors can be a risk for pushing the cheesiness factor too far, but Dwayne Johnson does reasonably well here. His entrance is quite funny, and even though his character is supposed to be a prima donna type, he never hogs the spotlight.

Terrence Stamp is an underappreciated talent - the Christopher Lee of his generation, as far as I'm concerned. He's the ideal choice for the super-villian Siegfried, and has the line in the movie that made me laugh hardest:

Siegfried's assistant: Too bad about all the dead movie stars.
Siegfried: Yes. What will we do without their razor-sharp political advice.

The original series was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, and they were brought in as consultants on this effort. I think this helped get the right feel for the characters, not to mention the running jokes from the original series (""Would you believe..."", ""Sorry about that, Chief."", ""Missed it by that much."", Etc.), which are not overdone and generally integrated nicely into the dialog without being too forced.

There are some flaws. A few scenes do go on too long. The ""get past the criss-crossing lasers"" scene and the chase scenes at the end are the best examples.

Seriously, this isn't a top-ten all time comedy. But it was funny. I'm sure some don't like the slapstick, and it is quite easy for slapstick to slip over into cheesy and boring. But I don't think that happens here.",1310428800,,2209,4.721354166666667

A couple of people criticized this movie because it doesn't do justice to the original Get Smart TV series of the 1960s. But even though there's supposed to be a connection between this movie and the old series, I think you should watch this movie with an open mind. Don't hold the same expectations for the 2008 movie that you had for the 1960s TV show, because there are probably good reasons why the ""Get Smart"" movie is different from the original series. They're produced in different time periods, for different kinds of audiences, and the actors in the old and new versions are good at different kinds of humor. So what if Maxwell Smart (Carell) is a bit goofy? That's what Steve Carell does best.

3616246,2,B001GMAVGE,"Over the last few years with internet and chat developments, I have met many American people and discussed classic TV thousands of times... the one topic I was always surprised at was how many Americans I had talked to who had not heard of ""Get Smart""...would you believe it?

Logging into Amazon right now to see how many 5 and 4 star votes this movie has gotten, I can only come to terms that they are the ones who have no idea that this movie is based on a classic 1960's TV show. If they had have seen the original Mel Brooks creation starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart: Secret Agent 86 (Also the voice of Inspector Gadget) and Barbra Feldon as 99, as well as all the terrific supporting roles by so many other great actors, then they would see that this movie does not hold a flame to the original series, and is almost a complete embarrassment to it.

The 40 Year Old Virgin playing Maxwell does not portray the character of Max well. Maxwell should be sophisticated, charming, a smooth talker when he wants to be while also being a bit goofy, a stumbling klutz, and almost cartoon-like in certain ways. Steve portrays him as a geeky loser who can not produce the timing needed to pull off the classic quotes.

Whoever is playing 99 was about the only one I think did any research on her character. She sounded a little like Barbra Feldon, and looked a little like her in ways, but she did not act like 99. She needed to lose the bitchyness and self involvement.

The chemistry between those two characters was not there. First they hate each other, then all of a sudden Max breaks wind and she finds him charming, and suddenly they're an item? For starters, the original 99 and 86 would never insult each other, it felt too uncomfortable to see these two fighting and arguing and trying to out do each other for a better part of the movie. I know they trying to update this thing to tell the story in a modern day way, but there are some things that do not work with these well known and classic characters.

Whoever played Siegfried almost looked the part at first, and at first I thought this evil sinister approach might be a good idea... but when he delivers a classic Siegfried line... he says it in a way that is just not humorous. Maybe they where going for it, but I think it failed.

The Rock, Dwayne Johnson is in here as agent 23, big deal, he seemed to add little to nothing being in this movie.

Larrabee as a bully? wt???? The Chief did not seem to be a good casting choice, the two poor attempts at geeky side-liners needed to go, and don't forget the stale as hell jokes of the fat person comedy relief gags... oh yeah, the sudden hit by a bus thing... we've seen that 1000 times already and it wasn't funny the first time. Are Hollyweed writers still on strike or something?

What this movie needed badly was Mel Brooks. Why wasn't he asked to make this film? Go over the script, add something, just SOMETHING to this movie to improve it and make it feel like something new, with that old familiar feeling to it? Least Mel would have gotten some kind of laugh from the pathetic attempt they had at an updated ""cone of silence"" gag.

On the comedy scale, I did not laugh as much as I hoped. I had a few chuckles, but nothing that I would say was hilarious or genius. And the worst part about it is, no matter how well this movie does, you can tell they have already written a sequel.. hell, there is even already a spin off available on DVD of the two geeks, and this movie isn't even on DVD yet.... gimme a break... there is no way anyone will remember the spin off to this in 2 years time.

I have talked about all the cons so far, so can I say anything nice about the movie? A couple of things; It was good to see the original Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) get a cameo appearance in a decently thought of idea to pay homage to the original Get Smart series vehicles. Interesting to see Bill Murray trying to be funny again, and err... if I happen to think of anything else, I'll get back to you.

Overall: Barely got to being an average movie. It's pretty much what you expect from a classic TV show to a movie, all looks, and more concern with setting up a sequel then to make a movie both old & new fans will enjoy.",1294876800,,4240,4.280898876404494

There are some funny scenes in the movie, not hilarious, because the scenes are not pushed far enough to make it hilarious.

example: The dance battle between the two main characters was poorly choreographed, too slow, and not silly enough to make it funny.

example:  Laser room scene, again not pushed far enough to make it really funny.

3616264,4,B001GMAVGE,"GET SMART is a television show that comedy fans hold in high regard.  Don Adams as Maxwell Smart was the perfect combination between bumbling Mel Brooks-goofiness and high security intelligence.  There have been a lot of television shows that have been made into movies (and vice versa).  Many of these are terrible.  From much of the press at the time of the movies release, one might think that the film adaptation of GET SMART starring Steve Carrell is a disaster, but it's not.  Instead, the movie stays fairly close to the original series, especially in spirit.

In the movie, Maxwell Smart has been working for CONTROL for a number of years and longs to be a field agent like his role model, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson).  When CONTROL headquarters is attacked, it becomes clear that the organization has been infiltrated by KAOS and that someone is a traitor working for the other side.  Most of the field agents who weren't killed in the attack are pulled and given desk jobs and Max finally gets his promotion as he's assigned to the field as Agent 86.  He's partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), who because of recent plastic surgery remains in the field since no one knows what she looks like now.  Before leaving for the field, Max is given some top secret gizmos from his two research and development friends Bruce (Masi Oka) and Lloyd (Nate Torrence).

Carrell and Hathaway give fine performances. They are both talented actors and there really is some zany chemistry between them on screen.  Dwayne Johnson steals many of the scenes he is in playing up to while at the same time spoofing the macho leading man roles he often is given.
Bill Murray has a very small cameo as Agent 13, so watch for that.  Also, many of the original devices and gags from the original series feature in the movie such as the cone of silence and the shoe-phone.

I enjoyed GET SMART.  I thought it was funny, with just the right amount of action and plenty of heart.  Though it's not quite as good as the original tv show, it as a great film adaptation of an original tv show that only misses the mark ""by that much"".",1283904000,,2111,4.574468085106383

3616279,2,B001GMAVGE,"Actually, by quite a lot.  GET SMART, the movie remake of the 1960s hit comedy series of the same name, is in no way true to the spirit of Maxwell Smart.  The original series was cute, warm, and wacky; a patriotic slap-stick comedy.  The modern day movie, GET SMART, isn't even a parody of the TV series; rather, it is a very pale and hollow interpretation of an American institution.

Neither my husband nor I found the movie version of GET SMART to be funny.  There were maybe two spots where we actually laughed (and hence, two stars instead of one); however, most of the time, we never even smiled.  Where the original was clever and quirky, the movie is banal and pedestrian, relying on too many insipid off color or fat jokes instead of real humor.  Where the first Agent 99 truly cared about Agent 86, from the first time she met him, this Agent 99 can't stand Max and he has to fight to win her approval.  Where the original Max was bumbling and lovable, this Max is clumsy, off-putting, and very dull.

There are times when a ""stupid movie"" can be really fun.  In this case, the stupid movie, GET SMART, is just plain stupid.  There is almost nothing to recommend GET SMART.

I wasn't sure how Anne Hathaway would do in this more serious, all grown up detective role but she was great too! The only thing that I don't like were the extra/gag scenes since most of the jokes were inappropriate. If you don't own this buy it!",1262131200,,674,4.1923076923076925

3616293,5,B001GMAVGE,"Yay! My 100th review. Now that that's done; I couldn't imagine Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway in an action film but they pulled it off well. Nobody can top what Adams, Feldon, Platt, Kopell, etc. did in the series and the actors in this don't rip off their interpretations or belittle what they had done. Carell plays Max with a deadpan wit, which I enjoy, compared to Adams' nasily voice which defined the character back in the 60s and it still does now. Hathaway is the accomplished agent who doesn't even tolerate Max until the end while Feldon immediately fell in love with him. Platt's Chief grew exasperated with Max's antics while Arkin's actually admired Max's talent. And Kopell (who makes a cameo) used a thick German accent while Terence Stamp is an English actor who plays Seigfreid with a bit more menace. The references to the series are excellent from Max's catchphrase to the shoe-phone. Even the three cars Adams drove in the opening credits are featured. The plot is a little cliched (drawing comparisons from how Steve Martin's Clouseau gets humiliated only to be redeemed in the end) and some twists aren't that surprising but it doesn't stop this from being funny and exciting. The gags and jokes are clever (this being one of few comedies I've seen in theatres and the whole audience was laughing) but the vomit joke was disgusting and not remotely funny. The action sequences were executed well, some scenes being homages to the Bond films (the original series being a spoof of them) such as the free fall fight sequence with Dalip (who reminds me a little of Richard Keil's Jaws and Kabir Bedi's Gobinda) from Moonraker. Trevor Rabin's score is excellent and I love the reorchestrated TV theme.",1258588800,,1718,4.8074324324324325
3616294,3,B001GMAVGE,"Get Smart is based on the classic 1960s sitcom starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart and Barbara Feldon as agent 99. In the movie Steve Carrell as Smart is Control's top analyst but he wants to be an agent. He finally gets his chance when Control agents all over the world are attacked at once by KAOS and they are left short handed. So agent 86 goes on his first mission with agent 99 played by Ann Hathaway.

The cast play their parts with verve and their are several laugh out loud moments in the movie, but it doesn't sustain the laughs throughout. People who didn't watch the TV show may like it more. I loved the old show and found the differences off-putting. Don Adams played Smart with a bumbling arrogance. Carrell is a brilliant comedic actor but he played Smart so straight he had almost no personality. Barbara Feldon's 99 was smart and confident but also vulnerable. Hathaway's 99 was self-centered and abrasive at times. Get Smart is a funny movie but not a classic like the TV show.",1257120000,,996,4.502762430939226

This was such a fun action movie with all the special effects and excitement still very present.  Awesome Awesome.  Steve Carell does his 'thing' in this movie and he is just too awesome for words.  To speak something so ridiculous with a straight face in such a serious situation - I wonder how his co-stars managed to get through the scenes without laughing their heads off.  And the sparkling diamond of the movie - Anne Hathaway - is it just me, or does she get more beautiful in each film?  She is a 'knock out.'  Really lovely to see her combine her comic talents with the swift actions.  This woman can kick butts with sexy style.  All the other casts were downright hilarious.  Alan Arkin - need I say more?  And the geek twins Bruce and Lloyd were truly icing on the cake.  Nice to see Masi Oka - the Japanese hero who travels through time -  in such a fun movie.

Blu- ray picture quality is excellent. Sound reproduction added another dimension to the movie.,1252713600,,274,5.25
3616304,2,B001GMAVGE,"As original ideas are hard to come by, it seems that eventually most every successful `classic' television series will be considered as the basis for a feature film.  With a history of rather abysmal results through the years, some who are actually familiar with the subject programs, have come to expect very little of such projects.  The world is decidedly different some forty years later, and the film version of Get Smart, retains little of the relevance, and even less of the charm or humor of the original series.  Like so many other big screen adaptations, the film attempts to capitalize on whatever cache may remain in a classic franchise, utilizing just a few threads from the TV series.  As the target audience for the film are those who may never have seen Don Adams as Agent 86, Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, Ed Platt as The Chief, and Bernie Kopell as Siegfried, this lack of connection was probably deemed irrelevant.

By making Max and 99 strangers, the heart of what made the original Get Smart so special is removed.  Instead of a warm familiarity, the characters start coldly at ground zero.  Besides his height, Steve Carell bears few similarities to the original Maxwell Smart.  Anne Hathaway may be talented and charming, but the version of 99 she is given, has little in common with Feldon's character.  There are winks and nods to the past; 86's red Tiger Sunbeam convertible and shoe phone, Agent 13 (Bill Murray) in a tree, Fang the dog, and Bernie Kopell's cameo, to name a few, but they really don't make any substantial contribution to the story.  With a skeleton framework, and main characters that are mere shells of the original, this Get Smart is firmly targeted for today's audience.

As such, the film isn't very funny, and only because of a strong finish, is it even a halfway decent action/adventure flick.  Up until the setting shifts to Los Angeles, Max and 99, clash and step on each other toes.  Perhaps the only bit in the entire film that is humorous is the dance number at the party, and there again the two leads are going against each other.  The Chief (Alan Arkin), and Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson) are mainly on the bench until they get to LA, where their contributions do help rescue Get Smart from forgettable oblivion.  The filmmakers consulted with series creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but it apparently didn't help much.  One good decision was to play down the delivery of Max's classic lines.

The film can also be viewed in a mode where alternate takes and versions are inserted, supposedly providing '62% more laughs'.  That stated improvement is not only hyperbole, but is false.  The alternate gags usually aren't funny, and instead of being a positive, these lame alternates just confirm how badly the writers were lost, groping for the right words.  What is really unfortunate is that the producers apparently fail to understand that reinserting the discarded material, does not cast the film or the filmmakers in a better light.  Instead they both seem rather pathetic, similar to watching a standup comedian bomb over and over again, with bad joke after bad joke.

Now that the premise has been set, a sequel is probably being planned.  Siegfried can be retrieved from the drink, and he and Starker could be featured more prominently.  Hymie should be good to go.  In the 'sensitive' villain Dalip (Dalip Singh), they have their version of Jaws (from the Roger Moore Bonds), primed for the next adventure.  Jaws did a parachute stunt in Moonraker, so next perhaps Dalip on a cable car?  Hopefully now that Agents 86 and 99 have developed a relationship, the writers will do a better job, because there is really huge room for improvement.",1251072000,,3702,4.798107255520505

""Get Smart"" isn't bad however though not particularly memorable.  The makers were wise by stylistically departing from Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's original blueprint but sprinkle the film with some amusing references to the original.  Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway were also wise in not imitating Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as Agents 86 and 99.  What jeopardizes the film's chances to continue as a franchise is that it's bogged down with an unmemorable central plot that makes it indistinguishable from, say, ""Johnny English"".

3616318,5,B001GMAVGE,"I was a fan of Don Adam's portrayal of Maxwell Smart in the original series, a show that was funny and silly, but also biting and clever far ahead of it's time. One of our daughters saw the new film and said she laughed her head off the whole way through. The Mrs. and I agreed we should check it out. We were not disappointed.

Steve Carrell does not try an impersonation of Don Adams, but the writers and performers do a great job of staying true to the spirit of the original while updating it in a way that our daughters, who wouldn't know Don Adams from John Quincy Adams, LIKED it.

We liked it too. All of the ""great bits"" from the old series are weaved in, at least momentarily, and sometimes I was laughing at the subtle homage. But at other times the filmmakers wisely decided to put Steve Carrell in a room and turn him loose. He has a scene in an airplane lavatory with a ""special"" Swiss Army knife that MUST be seen, although the Mrs. recommends you not have a full bladder when you do. Another scene involving one of those movie laser security systems and a rodent had me howling. My brother and I are big fans of ""Chuck Norris Jokes/Facts"", and I had to call him immediately after the film to tell him he HAD to see it (after our mutual disappointment at the new Indiana Jones.)

The plot is a skeleton on which to hang the multiple hilarious bits, but it works fairly well as a spy movie. Some of the Bond or Flint movies had plots twice as idiotic, and they weren't supposed to be comedies.

Carrell is ably supported by Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. She has several great moments - flashing her long legs on a dance floor and saving Max from certain death in a mid-air rescue involving a parachute and a kiss.
Alan Arkin brings the perfect pitch to this tale as the Chief, with one foot squarely planted in the ""serious spy world"" of government, and the other foot ready to observe Smart's silliness.

I was ready to laugh at a movie and this one delivered. The last time I laughed that hard in a theater was at ""Anchorman"".

Wrong, the movie works in almost every aspect, from the pitch-perfect casting, great characterization, and even the interesting story. Add in comedy that kept me laughing from start to finish, and I left the theater quite pleased.

Since then, I've seen this film about 3 or 4 more times, and each time is as good, if not better than the first. An entertaining movie in the truest sense of the word, and it's comic action at its best. Get Smart doesn't miss it by that much, but would you believe it hits it right on the head? Believe it...

Steve Carell knows better than to try and be Don Adams, so he does his own take on the character and pulls it off beautifully.

3616323,4,B001GMAVGE,"Max Smart does his job too well.  As an analyst for CONTROL, the most classified of covert counter-espionage agencies, Max delivers intelligence reports that almost nobody ever reads.  Max dreams of the day when he can join his idols, Agents 23 (Dwayne Johnson) and 99 (Ann Hathaway), but his boss decides that Max is too important to waste him in the field.

When CONTROL's seemingly secure headquarters is attacked from within, and its roster of worldwide agents is compromised, Max is hastily promoted to ""Agent"" and foisted on a reluctant Agent 99.  Their mission: find the base of the likely attackers, the implacable KAOS, and destroy it.  Led by the sinister Siegfried (Terence Stamp), KAOS's attack is likely the prelude to an even wider attack.  Lacking spy-smarts, and to 99's chagrin, Max finds his training sorely inadequate to the task.

I don't want to say any more about the movie's plot, which could have fit snugly in an episode of the show.  That said, ""Get Smart"" is actually a lot of fun, seldom hilarious, ""Get Smart"" manages to be consistently funny and entertaining.  The smooth script deftly maneuvers between newer material and the original - never losing sight of what made the old show fun while also not being enslaved by it.

The movie's strengths are its stars - impossible to overlook how this could have been another Hollywood retread of an old TV show, it's the performances that bring ""Get Smart"" over the top.  Alan Arkin is great as Chief, while Stamp deserves real props for managing to be funny (rather than pathetic) playing the most serious guy in a comedy.  Best of all are Steve Carrel and Hathaway.  Carrel creates a Max that is decidedly different from Don Adams (though he does channel Adams in one extended sequence set in a hidden KAOS weapons factory, possibly as a tribute, but also to remind you how far Carrel has gone his own way).  Hathaway is surprisingly effective as 99 (at times she even sounds like Barbara Feldon), playing as the sexy counterpoint to Max's undersexed virgin spy.  Never a laugh riot, ""Get Smart"" supplies a steady stream of funny lines, and you'll likely be chortling about ""muffins of mass destruction"" long after you forgot you caught this flick.",1240444800,,2224,4.8311345646438

3616337,4,B001GMAVGE,"After watching this movie, I really think there are two ways to review the Movie.

1. From the point of view of someone who has watched or did watch the original TV show.
2. From the point of view of someone who has no idea what the plot or premise of the movie is and going in blind.

I used to watch the TV show, so the majority of my review will pertain to POV #1.

To be completely honest I started to not like this movie when I first started watching it because I found myself comparing every little detail to the TV show. This is not the way to go about watching this movie. I don't know why I did, it of course is not going to be exactly the same, it's an adaptation. Anyway, once I got past that, I really started enjoying it. They did a pretty good job of keeping with the story line of the TV show, and showing how Agent 86 came to be. They also put a lot of stuff from the TV show that I think people who watched the show appreciated, like Agent 13, fang, and at one point had a large collection of original props from the TV show on display in the lobby of the building that housed Control. All in all, a good watch. :)

I will say though, I hope Hollywood lets it end there. I would really hate for them to do what they ALWAYS do, and try to milk every last penny out of a name, ruining the name. So listen to me Hollywood when I say do screw this up like you always do. I know you won't listen because you have no idea what the people want, you just know that you will take every single penny you can get your filthy hands on no matter how TERRIBLE the movies are you produce.",1234051200,,1590,3.94392523364486

3616339,3,B001GMAVGE,"Get Smart the movie uses current gags for humor while the tv series used dialog.  This difference makes the movie very different from the tv series that disappoints many core fans.  The movie is entertaining in its own way, spoofing Entrapment, Alias, and other spy movies along the way.  One must always have a dance scene in a spy movie.

 What was disappointing was Siegfried and Starkel, who both lacked the goofy incompetence and humor found in the original series.  Sure, Max was a goof, but Kaos was even more inept than Control.

 The 2nd disc is not worth the extra money in a special edition.  The gag reel is rather short and could have been included in the 1st disc.  The 1st disc presents the alternative jokes in a very aggravating manner.  It forces you to watch the entire movie and it is constantly interrupted with the phone booth elevator.  Only by pressing the enter button when the phone booth is shown, will the alternative gag line be shown.  Very tedious to be constantly interrupted and having to press the button to watch the gags.  It would have been much easier and entertaining to watch the gags the standard way with their own menu.

 Overall the movie was entertaining, but the poor special features in the 2-Disc Special Edition results in a 1-star deduction due to the higher purchase cost.  The single disc edition is good enough and a better value for your money.  Wished that other reviewers could have explained the 2nd disc in more detail, would have saved some money and only purchased the single disc version.  If you already have the single disc version, no need to buy this 2-disc version.",1233792000,,1631,4.659649122807018

The stunts and things in this movie were pretty well done. Just funny enough without going into the absurd.

The ending was pretty good I'll have to admit. It was not something that I was looking for at all and I felt provided a satisfactory conclusion.

Overall it's a nice escape for a few hours.",1232582400,,555,4.368932038834951
3616346,3,B001GMAVGE,"I LOVED the old Don Adams / Barbara Feldon TV show, grew up watching reruns of it all the time; and I've enjoyed Anne Hathaway in various roles, so I figured I would enjoy this movie, too.

WELL, expecting this to ANYTHING like the old ""real"" Get Smart is right out.  There were a few attempted gags that tried to make it similar, but they were so terribly FORCED and so poorly executed that they failed miserably.  I later read that Steve Carell actively avoided seeing the REAL Get Smart, because he didn't want to, I dunno, try to force himself to be like Don Adams?  How stupid could he be?  Carell should be strapped to a chair and made to watch Don Adams over and over and over until gets down and prays for Don Adams to forgive him for butchering the Maxwell Smart character like this!

Steve Carell can be a funny guy, but he was BAD BAD BAD beyond bad AWFUL ROTTEN in this.  The little Asian guy (Masi Oka) from Heroes acts circles around Carell in this.  Patrick Warburton is usually a one-man cancellation crew (i.e. if he's in a show, he's so bad that the whole show gets cancelled), but compared to Steve Carell as Max, Warburton seems like an Academy Award winner.

Anne Hathaway does pretty okay in a very poorly written role for Agent 99.  She doesn't shine like she did in the Princess Diaries, but she didn't have much to work with here, and Carell only sucked it all the harder.

Unbelievably, Dwayne The Rock Johnson CARRIES this movie.  I know, right?  Who would ever think Rock would roll like this?  Okay, he gets some help from Alan Arkin and Masi Oka, and even a little from Anne Hathaway, but The Rock is The Man in Get Smart.  If he's not in there, this doesn't even get one star.

To sum it up:  it's cute, but it's not ""Get Smart"".  Steve Carell is awful, and nearly pulls the rest of the cast down with him.  Anne Hathaway is hot, and can shine with good writers, but her acting was just okay here.  But The Rock really can act a little bit!",1232409600,,1971,4.289972899728998

Whether you enjoy Steve Carrell Anne Hathaway or the Rock all of them put in a decently good performance that entertains you.  Is the movie great?  No not by a long shot.  The movie rolls at a decent pace and you are able to watch Steve Carrell get himself into crazy situation only to be bailed out every time.

I watched it thinking that I might enjoy it if i tried to seperate it from the TV series, but it was still bad. The movie gave only passing reference to the players and comic genius of the original series. It seemed as though they were just trying to get those catch phrases and support characters out of the way so they could continue with whatever it was they were trying to do here.
I would suggest browsing around Amazon and buying the original series on DVD if you want some real humor. The original series is even relevant today with its use of humor. That's the true sign of real comedy.",1230768000,,733,4.280575539568345

Throughout ""Get Smart"", I couldn't help being reminded of the ""Austin Powers"" series.  How can you not?  Bumbling spy, bad guy asking for billions in ransom demand, etc.  This is nowhere as good as ""Austin Powers"", but there are some funny moments.

Also a few days earlier I saw Jim Carrey's ""Yes Man"" in the theatre...and it was god-awful.  Really nothing much more than a chuckle in that.  This flick at least had some things going for it.  I don't think Steve Carell played it right...it was weird not having him do ""the voice"" from the original series.  That would have made it better for me.

Add in Terence Stamp, Dwayne Johnson, James Caan, and more cameos than you can throw a shoe phone at, and...well, you get the point.  Almost everyone gets to be funny.

It is better to own the DVD because no way can you catch all the gags and one line jokes in one viewing. And then there is the ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" that offers 20 additional minutes of belly rippling laughter with alternate jokes.

This reminds me of ""Airport"", and ""Animal House"", and other movies like that where the gags and jokes come so fast that you have to pause to even catch your breath.  It is typical ""Get Smart"" out of control Agent Max fun.  And Agent 99 (Ann Hathaway) scores a perfect-100.

3616388,4,B001GMAVGE,"No one expects ""Get Smart"" to be anything more than a humorous bit of fluff riffing on James Bond and other super spies.  In brining a 40 year old TV show to the big screen, the powers that be brought Agents 86 and 99 into the modern era and gave them more detailed treatment.  Steve Carell brings back the kind of playing it straight humor that Don Adams did so well.  Maxwell Smart is a terrific analyst who has worked like crazy to become a field agent, but has been kept from it for a variety of reasons, not the least is his superb ability as an analyst.  Ann Hatheway is a modern woman and is more disinterested in 86 than Barbara Feldon's version ever was.  Terrence Stamp is a positively diabolical Siegfried and the humor associated with him happens around him (mostly).  Bernie Kopell's Siegfried was written with a touch of villainy and a lot more humor.  However, putting together a feature film requires more substance for a story than a half-hour sitcom.  (Kopell does make a cameo appearance so watch for him!).

The plot of the story matters little except for the jokes it helps to set up.  That was the point of the TV show, too.  Alan Arkin is quite good as Chief and the rest of the cast does their work with a nice touch.  Dwayne Johnson pulls of the ultimate Agent 23 deftly.  I also enjoyed Masi Oka and Nate Torrence as Bruce and Lloyd.  Their line about getting the super strong thread by milking spiders is unforgettable.  Bill Murray has a nice cameo as Agent 13 that is a wonderful homage to the original show.

You can also watch the movie in ""comedy enhancement mode"" were the alternate lines not used in the film are provided.  Some are funny, many are not.  I saw why most were not in the movie although I enjoyed the lines about the viola.

Anyway, cotton candy is fun to eat in the way this movie is fun to watch.  Maybe we can get another one with more of Bruce and Lloyd and Hymie (Patrick Warburton).  Yes, I saw the straight to DVD story they did with those two, but I would like something that actually works better than that little thing.

3616389,4,B001GMAVGE,"I have the whole 5 year run of the original series on DVD so I like corny 60s humor, Gilligan's Island and Beverly Hillbillies included. Steve Carrell was the perfect choice to step in for Don Adams as Maxwell Smart. I liked his rendition of the character from the beginning of the movie. I was frustrated at first by Ann Hathaway's portrayal of Donna Feldman's Agent 99 because she wasn't the sweet, seemingly innocent girl who was so impressed with Max that Donna Feldman had been. However, she grew on me as the movie progressed and all things come full circle in this regard as Max ultimately wins her in the end. There is more action and special effects in this movie than I expected which was also fun. The movie is often humorously amusing and several times it is outright hilarious. Look for the scene where he Max is trying to cut the tuff-cuffs off in the airplane lavatory, the one where he reasons with the giant thug on the factory roof top and the very brief but hilarious fighter jet cockpit scene (the special features section of the blu-ray elaborates on this scene till your stomach will hurt from laughing).

3616391,4,B001GMAVGE,"I remember when I was a kid watching reruns of `Get Smart' all the time.  It was seriously one of my favorite shows.  Granted, I haven't seen the show in years, but the memories I have are still very fond, and so when this little remake was released I was all sorts of excited.

It was worth getting excited over.

Steve Carell steps into the telephone/shoes of Maxwell Smart, an agent for CONTROL who is just waiting for his chance to work in the field.  When their secret facility is destroyed by members of KAOS Smart is sent into the field alongside the beautiful Agent 99 in order to stop this evil organization.  Agent 99 is rather reluctant, since this would be Smart's first mission and he is a bit of a klutz, but she has no choice.

What follows, is awesome.

I can't even count how many times I laughed throughout this hilarious romp, for just about every joke lands and just about every thrill actually thrills.  Carell is just superb as Smart, giving him this charming quality that I didn't think he could pull off.  I am not the biggest fan of Carell's, but my friends love him.  I just never got his humor.  This changed my mind about him.  Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson is actually really funny here.  I've been impressed with his acting since first seeing him in `The Rundown'.  Sure, he hasn't chosen remarkable films to make, but he is a far better actor than a lot of those `rapper turned actors' we have floating around almost every movie.  Alan Arkin is memorable as the Chief.  His quick wit and sharp delivery elevate his scenes.

The film belongs to Anne Hathaway though.  She is funny and charming and seductive and luminous as Agent 99.

This girl is just having the best year ever, seriously.  A few years ago she was taking a backseat to everyone she filmed with, and now she is outshining her co-stars and raking up some impressive awards (for her performance in `Rachel Getting Married', a film I am so anxious to see).  I have been a fan of hers since `The Princess Diaries' (yes, I saw that) and thought she was stellar in both her Oscar contending films (`Brokeback Mountain' and `The Devil Wears Prada') so I am thrilled to finally see her getting the honorable mentions instead of everyone around her.

`Get Smart' is very funny and very entertaining.  My one complaint is that it does feel about twenty minutes too long.  The ending could have been trimmed a tad (this is a family comedy, not a baity drama...short and sweet is the name of the game) but that isn't to say that the last twenty minutes isn't enjoyable.  It is still funny and action packed, and it adds to the story (twists, oh there have to be twists) but it does feel as though it is dragging a bit.

That is my only complaint though, and the film still gets a very excitable B+, maybe even an A-.  It is fun for everyone and a film I wholeheartedly recommend.",1229040000,,2860,4.448076923076923

I didn't know the Rock was in it, and he plays a great comic role.  As is usual Dwayne, The Rock, brings great comedy and action to his role.

Steve Carel and Anne Hathaway play great roles and I must say that Agent 86 is surprisingly more competent than I remember.

Basically, Agent 86 passes his agent exam...he wants to move out of being an analyst but the Chief doesn't want to make him an agent because he values Max's detailed analysis.

The Chief changes his mind when Control is compromised and the names of all of Control's agents are stolen by Chaos.  Only 99's identity is not compromised and the Chief promotes Max to Agent 86 so that they can stop Chaos from blowing up the President.

The fun starts from there.  I must also say that this movie pays homage to pretty much every spy movie out there from I Spy, to Bond, to the Charlie's Angels, True Lies, Spies Like Us, etc.

I was expecting to get comedy like Airplane or The Naked Gun and I was pleasantly surprised that this had much broader appeal and wasn't as silly.  It has great comedic and entertainment value.

With that in mind I wondered if I really wanted to listen to all the rehashed lines and view all the 60's comedy routines that the 60's television series was known for. However I do enjoy Steve Carell and Dwayne ""the Rock""  Johnson so I decided to go ahead and spend the quality time with my wife and daughter and take the chance.

I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw. While the film remained true to the spirit of the original series there was more than enough original thinking infused into the movie to allow the film to be enjoyed on its own merit without being nothing more than a tribute piece of cinema. There were loads of laughs, some superior physical comedy sequences (love the dance-off), smart dialogue (yes, I said smart) and consistent energy from beginning to end.  Maybe it's not destined to be a classic, but certainly a film the whole family can enjoy.

3616417,4,B001GMAVGE,"I've waded through dozens of remakes of old TV series and movies. And if there is one constant in the universe that I have learned it is that in every single case the original idea was done better and really didn't need a remake in the first place. And yet Hollywood would keep pumping the things out just to keep the income flowing with seemingly no regard for it's general poopiness. There is absolutely no reason I was expecting to enjoy Get Smart! as much as I did, but enjoy it I did in spades.

Get Smart! was a TV program of the 1960's starring Don Adams as inept but likeable Agent 86 (modern audiences will recognize Adams as the voice of ""Inspector Gadget"", which itself was not too dissimilar from Get Smart). In it Agent 86 spent each episode trying to thwart the activites of KAOS, a quasi-terrorist organization based upon more serious types found in the James Bond movies. Agent 86 used a variety of Bond-esque devices, notably his shoe, which contained a phone and other doo-dads to help him get through each episode. Accompanying him was the attractive Agent 99 and each week the two would stop the henchmen of KAOS. I watched reruns of the show when I was around 8 years old but I honestly don't remember much except for what I wrote above, as well as the now-famous intro scene with Max Smart going through dozens of sliding heavy-metal doors to get to a phone booth where he would, presumably, receive his orders.

In this incarnation Maxwell Smart, played by Steve Carrell of ""The Office""), has finally succeeded in becoming a full-fledged agent after several years of taking agent exams (and overcoming a helluva eating disorder) and is finally sent into the field after HQ is forcibly dissassembled by a double agent working with KAOS. Accompanying him is the more experienced Agent 99, played by Anne Hathaway. Hathaway's serious nature and Smart's unintentional funniness make for a surprisingly good on-screen chemistry between the two, which I honestly wasn't expecting. After a while a friendly rivalry springs up between the two in which they try to outdo one another (the dance scene being a hilarious example) and eventually come to have a serious attraction for each other.

Also included is an appearance by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as super-suave Agent 23, whom Max aspires to be like, and Alan Arkin as ""The Chief"". The movie starts out a little slow but by the time the ""Cone of Silence"" drops you'll be laughing your glutials off, and quite often. Carrell's scene in the airplane bathroom is an absolute riot! There is some homage to the original series in that some of the gadgets (the shoe phone, Smart's original car, etc.) are used eventually in the movie. In addition to this, I don't typically take notice of wardrobes displayed in various movies, but I have to give credit to these folks in this one. Anne Hathaway wore some subtle 1960's era type throwback clothing and it really added to the overall experience.

This movie is not at all that way.  It manages to pay homage to the original series without dredging up every possible moment.  It's fresh, contemporary and when they drop and old line or an old gag it's always done constructively frequently in a surprising context.

Steve Carell brings the viewer a believable character, a Maxwell Smart that actually is smart but somewhat inexperienced as a field agent.  Likewise, Anne Hathaway portrays 99 as an experienced agent with real emotions and feelings, someone that grants respect to Max only as he earns it.  In a sense, much of the movie is based upon the TV show but reels it in a bit and plays as being plausible in many ways.

The final scene is probably the most far-fetched but it is also very gripping.  Overall it plays about like the average Bond film but the humor is rarely far from the surface.",1227657600,,1014,4.588888888888889
3616428,2,B001GMAVGE,"Some pretty lame attempts to copy the original series just don't work, at least as a comedy. Sure, there were a few laughs but strangely enough, it works better as an action and suspense film.

Steve Carell does an okay job of portraying Agent 86 as does Anne Hatahway as Agent 99. However, someone should  have told Carell that when he says ""Missed it by that much"" he is suppose to indicate how much with his fingers but Carell just says it and his words, as in most of the film, carry no punch.

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Alan Arkin both do good jobs. Dalip Singh (WWE/WWF star) who looks suprisingly like a pumped version of the ""Jaws"" character from the Bond Films (The Spy Who Loved Me, et al), played by Richard Kiel, provides the physical punch and came through as one of the more authentic characters although his crying scene was also pretty lame.

It seemed like most of the other characters, including a few from the ""Heroes"" TV series were just thrown in for comedic effect but without further character development, thy just fell flat.

Finally, the DVD promises 20 extra minutes (""62%) of ""More Laughs."" I could only sit through the first 5 minutes of these. They were just too stupid. This script tried way too hard to be something it was not.",1227657600,,1263,4.521929824561403

The physical comedy was good. The romance worked. The relationship between Max and the chief worked. The cone of silence and the other gadgets were excellent. Some of the scenes fell flat. The homage to the car and the shoe phone of the original show was good.

This movie was extremely entertaining and funny. There were scenes that simply made me laugh out loud (the laser room, skydiving, throwing up in the face piece, or even ""The Rock"" running into a wall), and Steve Carell made a wonderful Maxwell Smart.

Maxwell Smart has been a reliable office agent for some time and even when he passes his field agent test the Chief, played by Alan Arkan, does not want him to go to the field because of his expertise with tracking people while at C.O.N.T.R.O.L. headquarters.

3616467,4,B001GMAVGE,"I remember watching ""Get Smart"" as a kid and loving the goofiness of it then. It was Mel Brooks at his slapstick best, and the pairing of Don Adams with Barbra Feldman remains one of the more iconic pairings in TV history. The best thing about this filmatic adaptation is that he maintains the zany spirit of the original. That's due primarily to the comic capabilities of Steve Carell as the new Maxwell Smart.

Carell, who has proved over and over that he shares the knack for comedy with folks like Steve Martin or Jim Carrey, provides the anchor for the films best moments. His deadpan delivery of clueless everyman is perfect for Max, who starts the film as the best details man in CONTROL, but wants more than anything else in the world to be a secret agent. When he finally passes the test, Chief (a spot on Alan Arkin) tells Max that he's SO good at details that the bureau can't let him out of the building.

A chance snafu occurs that forces Max onto spy detail, and along with a deft Anne Hathaway as Agent 99, they go to bring done a plan by CHAOS to sell nukes. Globe-trotting silliness ensues, along with plenty of good jokes, physical comedy and nods to the original series. (Watch for the brief cameo with Mel Brooks, and Bill Murray as the hidden Agent 13.) While the pace is snappy and there is obviously a sequel baiting ending, there are a few things that would have made this a better film.

Maxwell Smart, in the original, was not oafish or that aware of his ineptitude. In fact, it was is boisterous self-confidence that often made him get into problematic situations. ""Get Smart"" the movie didn't hit that target. Also, the political parody and bite in the TV series was always subtle, so a hamfisted 9/11 George Bush slam seemed both awkward and pointless, even while Ziegfried line about dead celebrities and their ""razor-sharp political advice"" almost made up for it. Should the inevitable sequel arrive, hopefully these things will be addressed. I am already envisioning the Hymie flick....",1226793600,,2018,4.647058823529412

3616469,3,B001GMAVGE,"I think what makes this movie work at all--given a script that is pretty much a mess and acceptable but not laudable direction--is the chemistry of stars Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway, combined with the good-will the original series instills in the viewer.  Carell, who has--thank goodness-- never been as far over the top and annoying as Jim Carrey, plays things fairly realistically. His agent 86 is immensely likable.  Hathaway, while lacking some of the ooomph of Barbara Feldon, is believable as Agent 99 and charming without being sex-potted up.  Dwayne Johnson presents a nice performance and, as usual, the under utilize Alan Arkin and Terence Stamp are admirable for what they bring to the table.  I think if your expectations of this are low, you'll likely end up enjoying far more than you'd think.  If you're expecting something that is a direct copy of the original, you'll likely disappointed.

The cast was great, it was overall pretty funny and entertaining and Steve Carrell pulled off Agent 86 well.

And for the first 1/2 hour or so I really thought the movie was very funny and contained all the elements of the show I enjoyed in an updated manner.  Then it headed off a bit too much into semi/pesudo action movie and the movie started to drag just a bit.

Like most t.v. shows turned to movies, the movie verion of ""Get Smart"" isn't that good, but I still laughed quite a bit, mostly during the bits Steve Carrell had.
Agent 99 was played by Anne Hathaway who merely impresses me. She isn't an actress I generally watch films of. She is ok, but she doesn't hold a candle anywhere near Barbara Feldon's 99.  Okay, I'll stop comparing the two now.
The film also stars Alan Arkin as the Chief(who is actually pretty good in this movie, he does comedy well), Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock as Agent 23, Terrence Stamp as the bad guy, Siegfried, and Bill Murray has one scene he is in as one of the other agents.

You can watch the movie in its full, uninterrupted form, or you can choose to watch it with embedded deleted scenes. This 2nd option is my only complaint about this DVD.

I rented it, and now I'm going to look into buying it.

I found this movie a lot funnier than the previews/trailers gave any hint to!  I like the comedic style of David Carrell; somewhat bumbling, sensitive, and at times even clever, it was a good mix of all to give you respect for the character despite his obvious deficit in being suave.

Some cameos and nostalgia are thrown in for the older crowd that watched the TV series.  My favorite was seeing ""Zigfried"" from the old ""Chaos"".

Anne Hathaway has grown up, and her acting ability shows it.  She made a pretty convincing ""tough girl"" and was a great foil for Smart.",1226448000,,861,4.35
3616485,3,B001GMAVGE,"I've seen the theatrical version of this film twice.  Once when it was in first run, and again now on Blu-ray.  To be blunt, I thought the film was ok when it was in first run, but wasn't impressed enough with it to want to see it again.  It was and is ok in my book, but I felt it lacked somewhat, at least when compared to my memories of the original TV series.

Ah, the TV series.  Total camp, but fun at the same time.  Loved by enough viewers that I can see why it would seem to be a target to mine on the bigger screen, especially with someone like Steve Carell in the lead. Carell makes a good Maxwell Smart, and if the story were better, I think this one could have been a genuine 5 star hit.  Unfortunately, as others have said here, it missed it by that much :-(

Anne Hathaway is ok in taking over the Barbara Feldon role, and Alan Arkin isn't bad as the chief.  Honestly none of the performances are disappointing to me, it's just that the story itself, at least from the theatrical version isn't as funny as it should be.

Which brings me back to the 62% more laughs that are promised in the Blu-ray.  Ah, more laughs from promised bonus scenes actually sounds good and enticed me to give the Blu-ray a try, but ... the presentation is just so disappointing to me that I have got to slam it in this review.

Offering up a director's cut or extended cut version of a film is something that I greatly appreciate, but if you are going to do it, by all that is right in the universe please do it in a way that respects the viewer and not as done here.

Seamless branching has been around in the DVD format for a while and it's used here, but isn't even close to being seamless.  Far from it, it seems that if you turn on the bonus scene viewing version of the film you get a neat little icon of Maxwell Smart in the phone booth (or at least of the phone booth) to indicate that bonus materials are now being shown.  That's not bad but... the icon is much larger than it needs to be and obliterates part of the screen when it needn't have been so intrustive.  Even looking past that there's a greater annoyance -- when the bonus scenes are accessed there's an annoying pause present, at least when played on my PS3.  Just enough of a pause that you'll find yourself highly annoyed and will probably want to turn off the bonus scene feature asap.

Sadly, from a cursory glance at the menus, there doesn't seem to be a way to just play the bonus scenes.  Instead you must access them in place.  I could be missing something obvious there, but then again, if it was obvious I don't think I would have missed it.

So, to summarize, there's a disappointing story (at least in the theatrical version) that doesn't get the best from the talent on hand, and an even more disappointing presentation of the bonus scenes that make the experience less satisfying than it should be.  Missed it by that much indeed.",1226448000,,2909,4.250909090909091

Get Smart is a film that never slows down, bringing a lot of action and humor to the screen.  The mission the agents are involved in was well written and overall, I just found it to be an entertaining film that exceeded my expectations.

3616491,4,B001GMAVGE,"This DVD release purports that there are 62% more laughs than the original. It would indicate, then, that the original theatrical release lacks 62% of its humor, which is probably accurate.

I grew up with my family enjoying the original television series, yet I never got into it. But I am familiar with the characters enough to watch this movie and have an idea of what I am about to see. Steve Carell stars as Maxwell Smart, who is out for his first official duty as an agent in active duty, despite his expertise in research. He eventually is paired up with the incredibly sexy Anne Hathaway, as Agent 99. Together, they are an excellent team and work very well together. Hathaway is surprisingly on time with her comedic delivery and is able to keep up with Carell.

The movie plays out entertainingly with little wasted space in the film. In light of Hathaway and Carell's excellent chemistry together, the comedy in the film is flattened by the action. I did not find myself laughing out loud in any of the scenes, although they should have been funny. I cannot pin point exactly what was missing, or maybe simply the fact I expect Maxwell Smart that humor be his character flaw, rather than a humorous situation.

Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23, actually provides more of the unexpected humor in the film than anyone else. He has grown out of his wrestling roots as well as his all-out muscle-head action hero stereotype and can be taken seriously (even in a comedy).

Alan Arkin rounds out the main characters as the head of control who is totally in his environment and plays it off perfectly. Surprisingly, there are some nice cameos throughout the film like Kevin Nealon and Bill Murray.

Despite how much I liked the film, there is the element of comedy that is missing. Well, let me justify that. I am not sure this film needs to be as funny as it advertises. Its probably difficult to advertise this film as something that is a good action film with some light humor. With Carell in the lead, its hard to advertise he is serious in his role, despite that his character has humorous qualities. So the advertising just leaned all the way in comedy - which is where the disappointment comes in (or misrepresentation).

In sum, Carell is perfectly cast as Maxwell Smart, to the point where he almost looks like Don Adams in the original TV series. Hathaway is not only sexy to watch, but shows intelligence and strength in her role. She is perfectly capable of holding the scene on her own, and also allowing the other cast to be part of the scene. She might be the one reason to see the film. If she is not already a major star, expect her to be very soon! GET SMART is a well crafted film in every way with expectantly funny bits that do not get in the way of the action (if not undermined).

3616493,2,B001GMAVGE,"Being a TV obsessed kid in the mid 70's, my afternoons were usually filled with syndicated shows of the decade before. One of those shows that caught my eye was Get Smart. Started in 1965, this was a spy comedy as USA's answer to James Bond but with a comedic flair. Don Adams played Maxwell ""Agent 86"" Smart, a bumbling yet charismatic spy working for the secret organization Control in the fight against Kaos, the Russian Cold War equivalent. Surrounded by a cast of equally interesting characters including his younger, more competent female partner Agent 99 and his always frustrated in Max's foolishness boss The Chief. Get Smart was a mix of old-school spy tricks and gadgets with good word-play humor.

Now flashing forward over forty-five years later, the Hollywood remake machine once again dips into it's pockets and pulls out yet another classic for, to put it kindly, modernization. But with today's technology in special effects, can a new team of actors bring back these spies to a world where the Cold War is a forgotten memory?

Just looking at the new cast, you can tell that visually director Peter ""50 First Dates"" Segal wanted to preserve and respect the original cast in that aspect, and does so very well. Just looking at Steve Carell's resemblance to Don Adams is uncanny, and with Anne Hathaway (who's career is a bit too big now for a role like this) as Agent 99 and Alan Arkin as The Chief, you'd be hard-pressed to think of any other actor in these roles today. But one thing noticable to fans of the old series to this film will be that even though they look like the originals, acting-wise they're nowhere near close. Carell's Smart is downright dead-panned completely ignoring the standards set by Adams. Once funny lines like ""Would you believe..."" and ""Missed it by that much"" out of Carell's mouth lack any humor or flair that Adams gave them week after week. Agent 99 now seems cold and calculated lacking any of the warmth Barbara Feldon originally gave her. And as for The Chief, well he now acts like, well, Alan Arkin, instead of depressingly frustrated with 86's antics, he's angry and hot-headed to the point of violence. Add in new cast members like over-acting Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Agent 23, Max's rival and mentor, and nerdy tech guys Bruce & Lloyd (who during the production of this film made a spin-off film of their very own), something is very missing in this remake. Simply put, this 2008 production is just too weak as a modern day spy film and not funny enough to be a successful comedic parody. It sort of lays flat, playing out as a reminder of how great and entertaining the original 60's show was. Sure, the Russian scenes are nice (be it I doubt they were really there on set), a couple of the gadgets have a tad of laughs, and the cameos by some famous faces are cool to see, overall this film should land in the ""forgotten remake pile"" with copies of I-Spy, My Favorite Martian, and The Wild, Wild West.

As for the disc itself, you can imagine the video/audio quality which is satisfactory for a 2008 film, but my review on the single-disc here should note you don't get much with just one. The only special feature here is an option to see the film in an ""Expanded 62% More Laughs"" version with an introduction by Carell. With it, you can see different takes and versions of scenes that already are in the film. However, with this process on other discs instead of a small icon appearing at the bottom corner of your screen, a Flash-like animation takes up the entire picture screaming at you to hit your ""Enter"" button now, and after four or five of these it gets extremely irritating. No wonder they gave this only 62%, because each alternate take explains why they weren't good enough to make the final cut. The Two-Disc does offer more behind the scenes, but at the cost I doubt they would be worth it when the movie itself isn't really rewatchable.

In the end, I can only suggest this to die-hard fans of the original series, as newbies to the franchise will find this too typical and not funny enough. And each true fan should realize that one of the movie's best accomplishments is that it was made after Don Adams' passing, so he couldn't call Carell on his shoe and say ""Missed it by that much"".

Steve Carell is perfectly cast as Maxwell Smart, an inept but intrepid analyst for CONTROL, a CIA-esque agency that is locked in mortal combat with a SPECTRE-like evil organization named KAOS. He finally makes the grade to field operative, and ends up being paired with Agent 99 (the beautiful and luminous Anne Hathaway). With the Rock added as a perfect field agent and Alan Arkin as the CONTROL chief, the movie plays, just as the series did, as a ridiculously funny satire on spy films - the cloak and danger missions, the shadowy organizations, the fancy gadgets, and the like.

But The Chief (Alan Arkin) won't promote Max because his extremely detailed reports are critical to the success of the agency.

All that changes when KAOS manages to attack CONTROL's main office.  With all their agents' identities exposed, Max has to team up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to discover KAOS' plan.  But Agent 99 is less than thrilled to be working with an obvious rookie who is a bit of a spaz.  Can the two stay alive long enough for CONTOL to gain ... well, control?

Fans of the original show will see glimpses of what they loved here, including some of the outdated gadgets that were cutting edge for the 60's.  Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway do a good job of making the characters their own while also recalling the originals.  And the rest of the cast is entertaining in their parts.

But while the original was a sitcom, this is an action comedy.  The plot was fairly predictable, but I certainly got caught up in it and was holding my breath for the climax.

There was still humor here.  Some of Max's antics were funny, but I found too much of it stemmed from bathroom humor and sexual situations for my tastes.  These were what earned the movie its well deserved PG-13.  The funniest bits went to the two gadget geeks, Lloyd and Bruce, and the agents who were reduced to being analysts.  If the movie had had more of them, I would have enjoyed it more.

Then there's the message the film is trying to send out.  I think it might have been trying to skewer both sides of the political spectrum.  But if that's the case, it didn't work.  Instead, I was left confused about what it was trying to say.  I've got to say, however, that one line the villain has related to all this got the loudest laugh from me.

I wish I enjoyed all of this movie because I enjoyed most of the film.  But for me, the sex jokes and bathroom humor made me wish I hadn't seen it.",1225929600,,2571,4.360759493670886
3616507,4,B001GMAVGE,"When GET SMART was in the theaters, the reviews were a little so-so, and I chose to wait until it came-out on DVD.  Did those reviewers see the same movie as I did? I'm guessing they did, but they may, like myself, have seen the trailer for the movie and determined that it was going to be a mere extension of the television show (I remember specifically from the trailer the scene where Max, played by Steve Carell, has trouble getting the telephone booth open.  This caused me to wince then, as it does now.  Fortunately, that scene was not in the final movie).

While watching a video on a TV, even a large screen high-definitiion model, tends to make one subconsciously lower ones expectations, I found GET SMART, the single disc, Widescreen Edition, to be fast paced, funny, and an even good, not great, action movie.

Prior to watching this movie, I was concerned that the memories of the original GET SMART television show would spoil my enjoyment, but the few gags carried over from the television show, like the Cone of Silence, were upgraded in such a manner as to be even more humorous.

The actors were especially well suited to the roles with Steve Carnell playing the analyst Maxwell Smart, Anne Hathaway playing cool and calm Agent 99, Dwayne Johnson as the do everything with a bit of bravura Agent 23, and Alan Arkin as the ""When did I lose control of Control"" Chief.  The premise of the movie is that Maxwell Smart is tired of being an analyst, so we see him trying out for the 8th time to pass the agent's exam.  His previous attempts failed mainly because of his being overweight, but on the 8th time, he passed, only to have his promotion overturned by the Chief because he is needed too much as an analyst.  Unfortunately for Control, and fortunately for Max, something compromises the identity of the Control agents, so he is brought into service.

What follows is a rather uncomplicated plot, with good action sequences, and top-rated acting by all.

The disc comes with a ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" with ""Get Smart Takes,"" that show during the playing of the movie alternative dialogue and scenes that were not used.  I would suggest you watch the movie first without the ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" so the tempo of the movie isn't slowed down too much on your first viewing.

This is a movie I would recommend to anyone 13 or older, there is some light profanity in the ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" that doesn't appear in the actual movie, and I found this movie well worth a second viewing just to see what one missed the first time through.",1225843200,,2565,4.6233480176211454
3616508,2,B001GMAVGE,"Hi Folks,
Being a huge fan of the original I missed this in theaters due to negative reviews..it isn't as bad as they made out...and is better than  much I've wasted my money on...all that said...the SINGLE DISC version is a much better deal in my opinion..

the 5 bonus features on the second disc of this set..all add up to about 20 minutes!! There isn't a really solid ""making of"" to be found in this deluxe 2 disc edition. There was no need for a second disc for this skimpy bunch of nothing. The Digital copy is truly the ONLY reason for anyone to buy this version and that is what my review is about. There are plenty of reviews of the movie..but if you don't need the digital copy ..stick with the single disc edition..this bunch of truly nothing isn't worth your money..
OH..I almost forgot the annoying 1st disc special feature with the bonus 62% more ""laughs"" ...well the reason its annoying is that you can't simply choose this version..(which wouldn't make sense anyway as many of the additional laughs were versions of scenes cut or deleted for ones in the movie so we are seeing alternative versions of funny scenes) but have to have your remote in hand and instead of an icon which shows up on screen the whole picture freezes up and shows you an image of a remote and you then hit enter and see the additional laughs (or additional attempts  at laughs)..as if you can even remember where you were in the story after all that ...over and over and over...really not a viewing  option  for anyone  who isn't overly curious to see all  the less than stellar bi-product of the production to understand  why those  ""laughs"" never made the movie in the first place.

I wish I'd have saved the money and purchased the single disc version.
you have been warned!",1225756800,,1768,4.496875
3616509,5,B001GMAVGE,"Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is the head analyst for a top secret intelligence organization known as CONTROL.  Smart, however valued he is as an analyst, desperately wants to become a field agent. He gets his lucky break when CONTROL headquarters is ambushed by rival terrorist organization KAOS and all the agents identities are exposed.  This, in turn, forces the unlikely partnership between Smart and the much more competent Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to thwart the plans of KAOS.

The comedic genius of Mel Brooks applies to this film.  He was a creator of the original series, and a consultant and writer for the film.  His presence is felt in ""Get Smart"" with the farces and parodies that reeked of his comedic style.  After all, it is based on the show that Brooks helped create, but you don't need to have seen or have knowledge of the original TV series to enjoy ""Get Smart"" the movie.  ""Get Smart"" is an incredibly funny undercover spy spoof and the entire cast blends together well and are all very amusing.

The bottom line is if you enjoy Mel Brooks movies, you will enjoy ""Get Smart"".  If you are just in need of a laugh, you'll get plenty.  So do yourself a favor, get a hold of this one and be prepared to laugh until your sides hurt.",1225584000,,1249,4.560538116591928

3616511,5,B001GMAVGE,I like comedy movies and this movie is fun and action movie. The characters are fun. So they doing action just great. I laughing a lot. I enjoyed the movie.,1225411200,,156,4.233333333333333
3616512,5,B001GMAVGE,"it is obvious that folks who claim that this movie is horrible and isn't the same as the original show are half correct. It isn't like the original show, the reason being is that it had to be updated for this generation. Having watched this movie and the original series (not the ghastly attempt to revive the series), this movie is in the same vein as the original show. To have Mel Brooks (one of the original series creators) to give his blessing to this movie is saying something. Granted this movie or series isn't for everyone and yet you are doing a disservice to yourself if you don't understand the humor.",1225411200,,614,4.491071428571429
3616513,5,B001GMAVGE,"Before I watched this film, I read the reviews of the press and most of them weren't great. I am unfortunately one of those guys who will put himself off watching it because of those bad reviews. I'm gutted I did as this film was simply the personification of brilliance from start to finish. It's slick, stylish and downright comic excellence. Even for a film like this, the special effect and general action would put even James Bond to shame. It's exciting, quite emotional at times, cool at others and just downright silly at the times that are left.

Steve Carell plays Maxwell Smart, a secret agent who desperately wants to get on the field. The government agency he works for known only as CONTROL are infiltrated by an evil agency known as KAOS which compromises the identities of all the current field agents. So in order to battle this force and still stay a secret, the chief of CONTROL puts smart on the field and assigns him the title of agent 86 partnering him with the much more experienced Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). Max looks up to his close friend and one of the best agents on the field, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson). He is the James Bond of CONTROL and it's no surprise that Max wants to be so much like him.

This is just a really light hearted and fast paced film. I guess it could just be labelled a comedy, but that would just ignore the other great aspects of the film. The action is done really well and isn't the tacky type comedy we have come to associate comedy movies when they feature action. Some of the sequences are genuinely unique and truly edge of your seat. The chemistry between Hathaway and Carell is great and one scene in particular expresses the comedic chemistry between the two. The laser room scene which is somewhat of a clich for spy movies is superb in this.

Carell is the usual silly guy we have come to know and love, his ridiculous expressions and perfected comic timing are all present. It's also very pleasant to see the wonderful Anne Hathaway in a leading role where she isn't the damzel in distress, or the naive teenager. The Bill Murray cameo is also something quite special as agent 13, he's only there for a moment and has about three lines but it's always great to see Bill Murray on our screens. It also seems quite a wrestler fest as well, obviously with the inclusion of Dwayne Johnson as agent 23 but also WWEs The Great Khali as the clich middle eastern, giant bad guy. Johnson doesn't take his character too seriously, which is something he always manages to shine in playing but manages to pull out the acting stops when he has to enter into the action man role.

An awesome movie all round and is definitely worth it just for the sky diving scene and the laser room.",1224892800,,2733,4.470941883767535

3616515,5,B001GMAVGE,"I was totally surprised to find that this was fun from start to finish. I thought it was going to be hokey and dull. I didn't expect to enjoy it this much, but it was a blast!

Yes, it's true that it's not a absolute duplicate of the old Get Smart. Max is actually smart and quite likable, though a bit nerdy and bumbling at times. This didn't bother me in the least. Steve Carell couldn't have been more perfect in the role, by the way. Anne Hathaway (Agent 99) was wonderful as usual. Personally I'm not a purist when it comes to remakes of old sitcoms. The changes added to the fun, and contributed to a more modern story.

The plot was full of twists, silliness and fun. We laughed out loud many times during the movie. Even the support actors were perfect in their roles and added a lot of humor. The Rock was a surprise and we enjoyed him in this role.

If you're looking for an exact duplicate of the old Get Smart series, you may be disappointed. If you're looking for a lot of laughs mixed with some adventure and even a bit of romance, you'll want to see this movie.",1224201600,,1076,4.213592233009709
3616516,5,B001GMAVGE,"I thought this movie was hilarious, saw it twice in the theaters. The tie-ins with the old series were there and amusing, but it was the changes from the original that made this movie worth seeing.  The 60's sitcoms were too one-dimensional for me-- Max Smart was a screw-up and everything he touched went wrong. Why would anyone put up with that?
 This update gave a more multi-dimensional character; The disasters were there, but he had skills, too.
Often the best scenes in the movie focused on the other characters-- the chief, the tech geeks, the other agents.  I think there was a lot of attention to little details that made the movie great.
Well worth seeing.",1223596800,,667,4.683760683760684

The nuances connecting the movie to the show will make you smile.",1223251200,,416,4.35064935064935
3616518,1,B001GMAVGE,"This is one of the most insipid movies I have ever seen. After about an hour and 20 minutes I completely gave up and left the theater. Whenever I watch the old show I can't help but constantly laugh, as much as I tried to do the same with the movie I could not do so once, not once. The only remotely funny joke was the one about Max asking how to get the bad guys to take the cyanide pill he is equipped with and guess what, they took that one right out of an episode I watched a couple of months ago. The theater I saw this was fairly packed and even the usual group in the audience who'll laugh at anything was pretty silent. Instead of wasting millions of dollars the producers would have provided audiences with a much better entertainment if they had simply pasted together about 4 old episodes. It's a shame Hollywood can be so good at blowing things up but so terrible at providing laughter and excitement. And regarding Hathaway as agent 99, my only recommendation to her would be to never again in her life try comedy again, ever. It's just not for her, period. After watching Carrell as 86 I would do the same thing but I realize this is what he does for a living and he has to live off something. At any rate, something good came out of this experience. By leaving early I was able to reduce the cost of parking to the exact amount of change I was carrying. Guess things could have been worse.",1223251200,,1405,4.226765799256506

He's really the only man for the job that I could even picture in the role.  And Anne Hathaway steals the show as the beautiful Agent 99.  Anne and Steve compliment each other in every scene with hilarious, witty dialogue and facial expressions that only they can do.  The Rock was also awesome as Agent 23.
