3959932,4,B002NS5HOQ,"I've bought every MST3K collection put out by Shout! Factory, and almost all the collections from Rhino.  I really like the rate at which Shout is releasing these, and I love the limited edition figurines and the tin we got for the anniversary collection.

Other reviewers have said plenty about the episodes, so I won't go into them much.  I am a little tired of getting so many Season One episodes in these Shout sets, although ""The Corpse Vanishes"" in this set was by far the best Season One episode I've ever seen.  In a previous review I mentioned the animated menus were awful, but with this set they are VASTLY improved.  The animated Crow and Servo actually do stuff instead of just sit and randomly move about, and the backgrounds and sets in the menus are much better.

Overall, there are some issues with the Shout boxes that irk me. I'm not a fan of the artwork and the mini posters are a waste of time and paper, not just because I don't care for the art, but because they're the same artwork that's on the individual DVD boxes.  Having individual DVD boxes plus a sleeve (or a whole box in this case) over it is way too much.  It takes up too much room and uses too much material.  Almost all other box sets I own use foldouts or individual hinged plastic pages to put the disks in, and I would prefer that here as well.

Also, the biggest problem is that there is always one disk on these Shout versions that has DVD flicker.  In the XIV set it was ""Final Justice"", where there were a LOT of white flickering parts that I thought were from the movie.  That wasn't the case, as I found out when ""Zombie Nightmare"" in XV had the same thing, this time flickering over the silhouette so I knew it was a disk or transfer problem and not the movie.  In this XVI set, ""Night of the Blood Beast"" has the same problem.  ""Final Justice"" was the worst of the 3 disks I've seen this on, but it's still pretty distracting.

Update: To see more about the DVD flickering, do an internet search on these disks with the phrase ""tape hits"", or search for ""dvd problems"".  Both the Shout! Factory forums and the MST3K boards have several discussions about the issue.  The basic summary is that the episodes were recorded on tape, not on film, and the tapes are degrading and causing ""smears"" or ""tape hits.""  Shout! Factory has only publicly commented on one episode (""Lost Continent"") and, as far as I can tell, does not feel they need to inform customers of the issue.  There is also some question as to whether the entire issue is really degrading ""tape hits"" or not.

I'm still glad we're getting MST3K released in official form and quickly, too, but there could be some improvements to the overall quality of the product and/or the way the company informs the customers about the issues.",1262908800,,2788,4.450787401574803
3959933,4,B002NS5HOQ,"ANOTHER MST3K MASTERPIECE,  I REALLY MISS SEEING THIS SHOW ON TV BUT HAVING THE MST3K SETS REALLY MAKES UP FOR IT, PLUS THE ADDED BONUS OF HAVING NO ANNOYING COMMERCIALS.  THIS SET IS ANOTHER MUST HAVE SET FOR THOSE WHO MISS THIS SHOW.

Or the turkey day segments can be watched separate with an intro by Kevin Murphy. Also includes episodes 501. Warrior of the Lost World, 521. Santa Claus and 105. The Corpse Vanishes. And the Tom Servo figurine is a nice plus, I am glad I bought this as a Christmas present for myself.",1259971200,5,622,4.235294117647059
3959937,4,B002NS5HOQ,"In this ""Limited Edition"" set, there are two movies hosted by Joel and two from Mike Nelson, so if you're strictly a Joel or Mike fan, check this out.

#105 - ""The Corpse Vanishes.""  Joel Hodgson hosts this cheap and cheesy movie with Bela Lugosi.  After making ""Dracula,"" lugosi sadly declined into silly movies like this one.  Before BOTOX, you had to kill young Brides to make a youth serum for vain women, like Lugosi's wife (why are only young Women always killed??)  Joel and the Bots do a decent job of riffing this silly movie about a mad scientist, youthful wife and killer orchids.

#501 - ""Warrior of the Lost World"" - Joel hosts this movie about a dusty hero with a talking motorcycle and evil dictator.  There are more explosions than you can count, with some even in slow-motion.  Dummies, are thrown off buildings in an attempt to make them look like the bad humans.  Stars Robert Ginty and Donald Pleasance.

#521 - ""Santa Claus"" - Mike Nelson and the Bots keep it alive with this dreadful movie made in Mexico in 1959.  The beginning is a bunch of kids singing the longest song ever recorded in any movie...ever made.  Add in the devil, Merlin the magician and Santa being in Space instead of the North Pole.  The dubbing into English is also laughable.

#701 - ""Night of the Blood Beast"" - Mike Nelson and the Bots host this Roger Corman movie that stars Ed Nelson.  The short is ""Once Upon a Honeymoon.""  The guys always loved to riff Corman and shorts from the 50's.  They do a good job on both.  Don't pay too much attention to the plot about an Astronaut who is a breeder for aliens.  This is NOT the one with Sigourney Weaver.  That's what makes it Hilarious.

The icing on the cake is that you get your own little Tom Servo in this Limited Edition set.  I must have him to keep my Crow T Robot company!

3959938,5,B002NS5HOQ,"Shout Factory delivers us another tremendous volume of MST3K experiments. Not only do we get 5 (that's right FIVE) episodes (sort of) we also get a Tom Servo figure. Looking at this set ...

MST3K EPISODE 105 THE CORPSE VANISHES W/ ANOTHER CHAPTER FROM THE COMMANDO CODY SERIAL
Bela Lugosi stars in this low budget (aka cheap) effort capturing young females with a special perfume and using the females to make his wife beautiful & young again. Believe it or not the serial is more entertaining - as serials tended to be non stop action - Cody continues to fight evils from the moon. - This marks the 3rd set in a row with a Season 1 episode. Some fans really dislike these episodes,but if you look at why it is being done, it actually makes sense. First off, sooner or later there will be a lack of easy to license Joel titles - having Season 1 titles extends the 2 Joel and 2 Mike variety for those that like the combination of both hosts in their volumes. 2nd, this is a public domain episode and super easy to get onto DVD via MST3K. So why not ? Watching season 1 allows us to see how the show started and grow.
UPDATE - great transfer and certainly was a lot of fun to watch..you can tell that Joel & the bots were starting to grow in this one. The silhouettes in this movie were green as they tried to replace the gray with a darker color. The green color is as rich as Ive ever seen thanks to the transfer. The host segment with Joel getting his hair cut by Crow and Joel's chiropractic invention exchange came right out of the KTMA era. I found it to be a very underrated episode. Radar Men from the Moon isn't all that bad, it was during the classic serials era where most were pretty good to decent. I will also say you have to go through a few skips to get to the main menu..lots of advertisements..

MST3K EPISODE 501 - WARRIOR OF THE LOST WORLD - This is a popular episode - the premier episode from the 5th season. The recently deceased late great Robert Ginty (the paperchase guy) rides around on an annoying motorbike looking for trouble or saving humanity. This has Megaweapon which became a cult hero of sorts & was the highlight of the movie. This is basically a Mad Max rip-off in a post apocalyptic world. Donald Pleasance from many a movie is the villain. A very entertaining episode - not just the movie, but the segments with Joel as Ginty's character and the riffs are great as well..too bad the scene near the end of the movie where there is a decent song was cut due to time limitations.
UPDATE - Another great transfer & the bonus features with David Worth are priceless - his story about how he got on this project plus the photos of him and the crew during the making of this film were really cool.

MST3K EPISODE 521 - SANTA CLAUS - at long last this episode finally comes on a set..Jose Luis Moreno as Santa Claus as he fights the Devil ( Pitch) An extremely memorable episode with Santa fighting Pitch and all sorts of weird characters. This was a K Gordon Murray distribution (he brought in all sorts of Mexican horror and scifi to USA theaters)
A great segment has Kevin Murphy as Santa Claus fighting Pitch (Paul Chaplin, This is absolutely hilarious and there are a few songs to enjoy..watch it at Christmas or anytime you will laugh your arse off. The main bonus feature of Santa Claus a 50 Year Perspective with not just the MST cast (Murphy & Chaplin) but of Mexican film historians is really interesting (& funny) Kevin Murphy is just funny as Tom Servo, Bobo or just as Kevin Murphy..

MST3K EPISODE 701 & TURKEY DAY SPECIAL - NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST WITH THE SHORT ONCE UPON A HONEYMOON
Another hugely requested episode. And you get BOTH VERSIONS of this movie, with the Season 7 segments and the Turkey Day segments...so if you count the 2 version PLUS the other 3 in this set you get your 5 episode set...
The DVD has a menu inside of Tom Servo's belly that lets you pick the version you want to see
This is a Roger and Gene Corman schlocker with a man is gets impregnated (??) by the Blood Beast (another ridiculous Corman creature. Michael Emmet is the host for the monster (he was Cal in the Giant Leeches)and the cast is pretty much the usual Corman characters...
And yes once again you get both versions of the movie with both Season 7 and Turkey Segments included ! How good is that. Of course the short is very entertaining as well..Corman's films were cheaply made at the time but still highly entertaining and fun..

Here are the Extras:
New interview with ""Warrior of the Lost World"" director David Worth (he was also at an MST convention to talk about this episode as well)
Santa Claus Conquers the Devil: A 50-Year Retrospective (as mentioned before this is really a great feature)
Santa Claus original radio spot
Santa Claus still gallery
Teaser trailer for ""Wonder World of K. Gordon Murray in Colorscope""
Night of the Blood Beast Turkey Day host segments (not correct as you get the entire episode)
Turkey Day `95 bumpers
Original theatrical trailers
Four exclusive MST3K lobby cards by artist Steve Vance
Also, in a limited-edition version there's a Tom Servo figurine (yes a long awaited Tom Servo figure !!! And its cute !! )

Shout has done nothing but bring excitement back into the sets..the high anticipation, the announcement of the sets & what they come with ...
December 1st is the release date and I can hardly wait...and hopefully Volume 17 will be around the corner :) !!

Keep up the great work Shout Factory !",1252368000,39,5486,4.4473161033797215
3959939,5,B002NS5HOQ,"This set features two episodes hosted by show creator Joel Hodgson and two hosted by series head writer Mike Nelson. All are from the Comedy Central era of the show.

105- THE CORPSE VANISHES with short: COMMANDO CODY PT 3

This 1942 black and white thriller features Bela Lugosi as, surprise, a mad scientist who kills young women for glandular fluid that he uses to keep his own aging wife young and alive. He has two evil assistants, again surprise, a malevolent dwarf and a huge oaf. Commando Cody (Radar Men From The Moon) Part 3 is also riffed by the crew of the SOL. Tom Servo's head explodes for the first of many times in one of the host segments. Commando Cody and Bela Lugosi in the same episode equals much fun.

501- WARRIOR OF THE LOST WORLD

A color film from 1983 by David Worth and starring Robert Ginty (""The Paper Chase Guy""), Persis Khambatta and Donald Pleasance. This ""High Plains Drifter"" knock-off with motorcycles and post-apocalyptic geeks is a laugh riot from beginning to end. The talking motorcycle, slinky Nastasia (Khambatta) evil dictator Prossor (Donald Pleasance), and Megaweapon are must-see entertainment. The running gag regarding the refusal to ""remember"" the starring actor's name is hilarious. Tom Servo riffing on dozens of people in under one minute is legendary. A really strong episode.

521- SANTA CLAUS

This 1959 color film is a Mexican import courtesy of K. Gordon Murray. It is bizarre in the extreme. Santa lives on a cloud in outer space with children from all over the Earth as his helpers. The opening of the film showing the various cultures of the children is out-dated, weird, possibly offensive and achingly funny. The film only gets stranger from there as Santa has to go to Earth to deliver toys using all manner of wizardry conjured up by his assistant, the wizard Merlin. The host segment featuring Mike and the 'Bots as the rock band ""Santa Klaws"" is worth the price of admission all by itself.

701- NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST with short: ONCE UPON A HONEYMOON

A black-and-white Roger Corman film made in 1958 is about an astronaut who returns to Earth seemingly dead at first, but he later turns out to be alive and pregnant with alien young! If the premise of the film isn't funny enough, MST3K certainly makes it so. Filmed in Bronson Canyon like many other fun films (e.g., Robot Monster, It Conquered The World), it also features re-used props from other Corman films. This is one of only seven episodes in MST3K season seven and features the beginnings of the Pearl Forrester character in Deep 13 after the departure of Frank Conniff from the show. Pretty much any Roger Corman film used on MST3K made for a good episode of the show and this one is no exception.

My favorite of this particular release has to be Santa Claus.  I am not, by nature, a Christmas person, and this movie shows why!  If you are an MST43K fan, you probably already have this.

It's a dub from Mexico, or someone's coke-fueled fever dream; I'm not quite sure which.  Either way it's fantastic in its absurdly cheesy sets, lack of coherence and outright bat-s*** insanity.

The other three episodes I'd say are not for the faint of heart or new to the show.  Warrior of the Lost World and The Corpse Vanishes drag and I despise the Commando Cody shorts.  So sue me.  Night of the Blood Beast is a Roger Corman vehicle, which should be gold but fails to hold up to some of their other Corman take-downs.  The short, Once Upon A Honeymoon, is the highlight of that DVD for me.  It's one of a long series of sly pro-telephone shorts they've done of the years, as if we needed any more convincing by the 1950's that telephony was an important part of our lives.",1325462400,2,887,4.432098765432099

So many humorous references are made per episode each can be watched many times and something new is picked up each time. Loved the series when it was new, still love it today.

3959965,4,B002NS5HOQ,"Easily my favorite all time show, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has quite the cult following and it has grown over the years as more and more volumes keep coming out. In this installment we get treated to 2 Joel episodes and 2 Mike episodes.

Episode 105-The Corpse Vanishes including the short ""Commando Cody Part 3""
One of the few shows from the first season on cable (after the KTMA season) and it certainly has a different feel to it, especially with Tom Servo's voice (provided by Josh Weinstein who also plays Dr. Forrester's side kick). The pacing of the riffs is somewhat slower than later seasons, but at times still funny, especialy during the short, which is goofy but likeable for an old serial. As for the feature, Bela Lugosi is a doctor who steals the youth of young brides to help his own wife stay young, there's also a journalist whose on his tail. The two assistants, a dwarf and a dumb bumbling goof are goofy enough, the plot just adds more to it. This is a good, funny one in parts, and Josh as Servo is quite deadpan and funny. Best line: ""You may now bury the bride"".

Episode 501-Warrior of the Lost World
Set in the post apocalyptic future, the actor from ""Paperchase"" (what the crew keeps calling him, a good running gag by them) rides in on supersonic speedcycle (with an incredibly annoying voice) and is recruited by a small group called The Outsiders to take down the evil dictator Prossor (Donald Pleasence) and his band of baddies called the Militia. The gags are fast and furious, aimed at just about anyone and anything. The main actor, Donald Pleasence and the motorcyle especially get the brunt of them. This film contains the infamous Megaweapon, which is sadly the most impressive thing in the film. This one is a great episode, constantly goofy and funny. Best Line: ""I can't tell you how richly satisfying this is"".

Episode 521-Santa Claus
Filmed in 1959, this import from Mexico takes various myths and stories about Santa, puts Pitch, one of the devil's henchmen in charge of preventing Santa from bringing joy to the children of the world and it becomes a giant, nightmarish mess. The jokes are rapid fire at everything including the odd contraptions Santa has in his castle in the sky (?????), especially the red lips I think, which are very horrifying. Its such a bad, goofy movie that only Mike and the bots can make passable and they more than succeed. Best Line: ""A pentagram and reindeer laughing, you figure it out.""

Episode 701-Night of the Blood Beast including the short ""Once Upon A Honeymoon""
From the shortened season 7 we get Roger Corman's answer to whether a man can get pregnant. After a man dies in a spaceship crash, he later comes back to life but its discovered he's carrying alien embryos inside him. This of course leads to the alien itself trying to prevent the elimination of the embryos and even the man feels an attachment to keep them alive. Its typical Corman not very well written, and very cheap. The short ""Once Upon A Honeymoon"" is quite funny, and totally goofy about a guy who must finish a song before going on his honeymoon. His wife and some annoying angel help him complete it. Mike and the bots have a field day with both the short and the feature and they keep the jokes coming which is good cause both especially the movie are pretty dull. Best line: ""Well we had to snap him in two like a frozen dog to get him out of the space capsule""

3959966,5,B002NS5HOQ,"Warrior of the Lost World is one of my all-time favorite episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I watched it several times when it aired on Comedy Central in the mid-1990s, but unfortunately I never had a chance to tape it on the VCR. So when I learned it was on DVD, I immediately purchased this set. Viewing the episode for the first time in years, I was falling out of my seat laughing.

I have described Warrior of the Lost World as ""The Road Warrior meets 1984.""  It's a cheesy film, but it falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category.  In other words, it is not a great film by any means, but it is definitely not boring, and you'll come away from it entertained and amused. Add to that the snarky, clever commentary & skits by Joel, Tom Servo, and Crow (the ""What if the Warrior of the Lost World failed his driving exam?"" sketch is hysterical) and you have a truly funny experience.

One of the bonus features on this DVD set is a brand new interview with David Worth, the director of Warrior of the Lost World. Worth definitely gets credit for being a good sport and having a sense of humor about his movie being roasted. And the interview is both funny and informative.

And that is just one of the four episodes on this DVD box set. The other three are also great MST3K installments.",1307059200,,1296,4.338842975206612
3959967,5,B002NS5HOQ,"This set features two episodes hosted by show creator Joel Hodgson and two hosted by series head writer Mike Nelson. All are from the Comedy Central era of the show.

105- THE CORPSE VANISHES with short: COMMANDO CODY PT 3

This 1942 black and white thriller features Bela Lugosi as, surprise, a mad scientist who kills young women for glandular fluid that he uses to keep his own aging wife young and alive. He has two evil assistants, again surprise, a malevolent dwarf and a huge oaf. Commando Cody (Radar Men From The Moon) Part 3 is also riffed by the crew of the SOL. Tom Servo's head explodes for the first of many times in one of the host segments. Commando Cody and Bela Lugosi in the same episode equals much fun.

501- WARRIOR OF THE LOST WORLD

A color film from 1983 by David Worth and starring Robert Ginty (""The Paper Chase Guy""), Persis Khambatta and Donald Pleasance. This ""High Plains Drifter"" knock-off with motorcycles and post-apocalyptic geeks is a laugh riot from beginning to end. The talking motorcycle, slinky Nastasia (Khambatta) evil dictator Prossor (Donald Pleasance), and Megaweapon are must-see entertainment. The running gag regarding the refusal to ""remember"" the starring actor's name is hilarious. Tom Servo riffing on dozens of people in under one minute is legendary. A really strong episode.

521- SANTA CLAUS

This 1959 color film is a Mexican import courtesy of K. Gordon Murray. It is bizarre in the extreme. Santa lives on a cloud in outer space with children from all over the Earth as his helpers. The opening of the film showing the various cultures of the children is out-dated, weird, possibly offensive and achingly funny. The film only gets stranger from there as Santa has to go to Earth to deliver toys using all manner of wizardry conjured up by his assistant, the wizard Merlin. The host segment featuring Mike and the 'Bots as the rock band ""Santa Klaws"" is worth the price of admission all by itself.

701- NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST with short: ONCE UPON A HONEYMOON

A black-and-white Roger Corman film made in 1958 is about an astronaut who returns to Earth seemingly dead at first, but he later turns out to be alive and pregnant with alien young! If the premise of the film isn't funny enough, MST3K certainly makes it so. Filmed in Bronson Canyon like many other fun films (e.g., Robot Monster, It Conquered The World), it also features re-used props from other Corman films. This is one of only seven episodes in MST3K season seven and features the beginnings of the Pearl Forrester character in Deep 13 after the departure of Frank Conniff from the show. Pretty much any Roger Corman film used on MST3K made for a good episode of the show and this one is no exception.

This DVD also has the third episode of Commando Cody & The Radar Men From the Moon. We also get to see the early Tom design plus one of the funniest invention exchanges of the first season.
The second DVD, show 501 is the Warrior of the Lost World.  No, sadly there is no dinosaurs, but there is a Megaweapon and it was made in Italy.  The basic story of a world after a nuclear holocaust, a police state, a small band of rebels, so on.  Kind of Star Wars without the money, writing, well known actors.  And a bookeeper.

3959976,5,B002NS5HOQ,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000 Volume XVI"" is another winner from our friends at Best Brains and Shout Factory. Again, this set finds Joel, Mike and the Bots mocking four laughably bad movies from all across the cinematic horizon, and thoughtfully adds deluxe packaging with a miniature Tom Servo statuette and four mini posters.

While these films aren't my all-time favorites from the series, they are thoroughly mocked, and filled with many extras (my favorite are the Turkey Day 1995 spots and ""Santa Claus Conquers the Devil"") that make this an unbeatable package. The four films are ""The Corpse Vanishes,"" ""Warrior of the Lost World,"" Santa Claus,"" and ""Night of the Blood Beast.""

""The Corpse Vanishes,"" with a ""Commando Cody"" short (Episode 105) was the most trying of the episodes for me. Despite a hammy performance by Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (what a shocker,) who has invented a special scent to further his evil plans, I just couldn't get into this movie. I view this as worthwhile mostly as a historical relic, as it's from the first season, showing off the humble KTMA roots of MST3K, complete with an even cheesier look than normal and, of course, the original voice of Tom Servo courtesy of J. Elvis Weinstein. Even at this early point in the show's run, the wit of Joel and the Bots is sharp, but no number of well-honed barbs can make the plodding pace of the film or short overly enjoyable. I generally dislike the old serial shorts, and particularly ""Commando Cody."" This is worth viewing, but unless you really love early horror films, probably not more than once.

""Warrior of the Lost World"" (Episode 501) is an absolute gem of an episode. This episode has everything you could want: a ridiculous post-apocalyptic sci-fi plot, great hammy acting, and truly ridiculous technology. Written and directed by David Worth, and starring Robert Ginty, Persis Khambatta, and Donald Pleasence, this film actually contains far more talent than most MST3K episodes, but that talent is hilariously squandered in this film. This is another Joel episode, and Joel and the Bots have rarely been in better form. The riffing is pointed and hilarious, and Joel dressed up as Ginty in one of the host segments is unforgettable. The plot concerns a renegade biker and his talking motorcycle. This is no ordinary talking motorcycle, it's an extremely annoying motorcycle with very high-tech detection equipment that can spot and call out the presence of ""geeks"" and more at a mile range or so. Ginty, who sadly passed away last year, is best known for his roles in ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" and ""The Paper Chase,"" leading to him becoming known as ""The 'Paper Chase' Guy"" by Joel and the Bots, to great comedic effect. Persis Khambatta stars as the beautiful love interest while Donald Pleasence hams it up in one of his most hysterical bits of over-acting ever, playing the same role he always does as the crazy bad guy. The highlight of the episode is the interaction with the technological wizardry of the bike, and especially the fan favorite scene of Ginty and the bike versus ""Megaweapon,"" which is a dump truck. This movie has to be seen to be believed and is one of my favorite MST3K episodes ever. As a special treat, the extras include an interview with David Worth about the project, and it is both entertaining and interesting.

""Santa Claus"" (Episode 521) is a stupid Mexican kid's movie made by K. Gordon Murray, and features a truly bizarre re-telling of the Santa tale, ultimately boiling down to a good-versus-evil morality play. Along the way Santa (who lives in a castle in the clouds, and has some very unusual spying apparatus) confronts Pitch, the devil, who is the hammiest demon in the universe (I especially enjoyed his dancing.) We meet characters like Lupita, a girl who is poor but only wants a doll for Christmas, and her evil counterparts, three boys who plan to kidnap Santa in an unsporting manner. Without question my favorite scene has to be the opening shot where the children of the world sing and dance culturally appropriate songs (Not!) while Santa plays his organ. There is space in the extras devoted to this to very good effect, and despite my love for ""Warrior of the Lost World,"" I think this is my enduring favorite of the set because of the juxtaposition of surrealism on a really stupid children's movie. ""Weird enough for you, folks?""

""Night of the Blood Beast"" with the short ""Once Upon a Honeymoon""(Episode 701) was the ""Turkey Day"" 1995 episode, and receives lots of attention in the extras. This is one where the short was, for me, better than the movie. A guardian angel, Wilbur, comes down to preserve the honeymoon of a newly married couple, but the film turns into an exercise in writing a song (""The Wishing Song"") and discussing appliances. Hear the actress sing lines like ""I want a refrigerator with a door that will close and will stay closed...and a phone, a bright red phone, a kitchen phone!"" The commentary from Mike and the Bots is absolutely priceless and makes this one of the highlights of the entire series, much like ""Hired!""

""Night of the Blood Beast"" only requires two words to fully grasp: Roger Corman. The film is about an astronaut who goes into space in an utterly ridiculous spacecraft, only to have something horrible happen to him: not only does he crash, he's impregnated by a Blood Beast, which must be seen to be believed (I especially like the animations under the microscope in the lab.) Of course the whole thing ends like every other movie in the genre does (it reminded me especially of ""Zontar, The Thing From Venus,"") with tragic deaths and a hope of renewal. It's a good episode, and I like it, but it will forever be overshadowed by the short.

This is a great set for lovers of cheesy movies everywhere, and I highly recommend it.",1271894400,4,5828,4.781529294935452
3959977,5,B002NS5HOQ,"Another great selection of movies from the long-lived show tailor-made for nerds, geeks, and all things I love in the world worth mocking.  The miniature Tom Servo's color was browner than I'd expected, but of a solid make and really it's just there for more nerdy trinkets to put on shelves and display your devotion to a show devoted to making fun of the ""worst"" of cinema.

Two Joel era episodes (including a first-season with the ultra-low budget opening and set, along with Tom Servo's original voice), a Mike Nelson Christmas episode from when Frank and Dr. Forrester were still around, and a Thanksgiving episode from around that similar time, though Frank's gone and Mother Pearl is in his place.  The best part of that last one is the DVD includes the host segments made to be played around the MST3K marathon they had that day, the cut of the show that featured clips that related to the Thanksgiving theme, as well as the one with aired with different host segments in repeats.  Good choices.",1269388800,2,1003,4.714285714285714
3959978,5,B002NS5HOQ,"Another great set for MST3k fans.  Warrior of the Lost World is worth the price of admission alone.  I like the Rhino sets and have most of them as well, but I fell like the Shout Factory releases are being put together by some folks who really appreciate the show and are enjoying these sets as much as we are.  The Tom Servo figure looks great as well, very good detail, the color is a tiny bit off, but still when paired with the Crow from the 20th Aniv. set they're beyond great.  Santa Claus is totally bizarre and it's funny to watch the ""guys"" have to endure it and still be funny.

Great job Shout Factory, keep 'em coming!  Also, maybe for XVIII (since 17 is already out) we could get some Master Ninja in there?

Nice to see Dr. Laurence ""Larry"" Erhardt (Josh ""J. Elvis"" Weinstein - original Tom Servo voice) in the set.

Santa Claus: What a messed up trip of a movie. Does not disappoint. Creepy factor helps make this one a good addition to the set.

Night of the Blood Beast:
Roger. Corman.
Fun to see the debut of Pearl. Her interactions with Crow are great. Also like the thanksgiving clips and the plot of alien pregnancy/mind control is quite fun.

Warrior of the Lost World:
This post-Apocalypse talking-bike episode rounds out the set quite nicely. Good riffing.

3959987,4,B002NS5HOQ,"Introduction

The sixteenth collection of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" DVDs was released during the Christmas gift buying season and appropriately features one of the most infamous holiday movies of all time.  The other three films may not have any specific seasonal relevance, but I find most episodes of MST3k make the long winter nights seem less cold and chilling.

THE CORPSE VANISHES (1942)
(with short: an episode of the serial, COMMANDER CODY AND THE RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON)

The main feature of this episode is a very hokey story about a mad scientist (played by the one and only Bela Lugosi).  Bela's shtick in this one is to kill brides on their wedding day using poisoned flowers for the express purpose of draining their life essence and injecting that essence into his wife.  The film is fairly corny, extremely silly, and the plot is incredibly obvious.

Like many episodes in MST3k's first season, THE CORPSE VANISHES is a little harder to watch than experiments from later years.  The riffing crew hadn't yet hit their prime, and a lot of the jokes are more obvious, less subtle and not quite as funny than they would become.

WARRIOR OF THE LOST WORLD (1984)

This is a rather fun film which owes one or two aspects of its production to Mad Maxx.  The movie stars (in order of appearance): the PAPER CHASE guy, the bald lady from STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, and Donald Pleasance (the latter of which apparently came straight from the set of James Bond and didn't even bother changing out of his Blofeld costume).  The story features a talking motorcycle and is virtually incomprehensible (both the story and the motorcycle that is).  The most amusing part of this disc is the bonus interview with the writer/director (David Worth) in which he a) acknowledges that this was a cheap and hastily made production and b) gives out his email address and invites heckling and correspondence.

SANTA CLAUS (1959)

I've seen this Mexican production of the Santa Claus story twice, yet all I can remember are disparate, disconnected images of horror.  There are flashes of a giant ear which can hear the entire world; scenes of horribly clichd and stereotypical children of all nationalities helping Santa with his preparation; and disturbing mechanical laughing, demonic reindeer.

NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST (1958)
(with short: ONCE UPON A HONEYMOON)

The short film features a newlywed couple finally getting to go away on their honeymoon... until the phone rings forcing the young man to put his suitcase aside until he completes his assigned task of writing a fairly inoffensive melody for a fussy, demanding diva.  The film has the strong feeling of being nothing more than a promotional advertisement (I can't imagine anyone becoming emotionally invested in a couple who do little other than whine and smoke cigarettes), yet it's hard to figure out exactly what product they are trying to sell.

The main feature stars a very young and less elusive Robert Denby.  The plot is one that any viewer of other 1950s sci-fi movies will be familiar with.  A rocket ship crashes back to Earth, but unknown to anyone there is a strange alien creature which returns with it.  At no point is there anything interesting or remarkable about the movie.  It immediately moves from the space business right to the closed set where characters get attacked and/or killed one at a time.  The movie feels like literally dozens of other MST3k movies (probably because of the name Roger Corman prominently seen in the credits).

Stinger

The movies in any box set of MST3k would be tough to sit through without the mocking of Joel/Mike and the bots, but that seems even more apparent in this particular case.  These are really bad movies, even by the usual standards.  But fortunately the MST3k writers were more than up to the task.  Even the lesser episodes (for me the riffing for NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST started slow but fortunately ended fast) are entertaining.",1264464000,,3964,4.864381520119225
3959988,4,B002NS5HOQ,"Night of the Blood Beast and Warriors of the Lost World are both standout episodes, and Santa Claus is so odd that it's tough not to enjoy it.  The Corpse Vanishes is a first season episode and maybe not as strong as the other material.  Nice extras with this collection: the Thanksgiving Day version of Blood Beast is great, and the interviews relating to Santa Claus were very good.",1264464000,,384,4.550724637681159
3959989,4,B002NS5HOQ,"I think there is a certain order in which to watch the 4 flicks included in vol. XVI. You begin with The Corpse Vanishes because it is from season 1 and is the earliest example of the patented MST3K technique available. As you move on to dics's 2, 3 and 4 you will experience the various changes that evolved as the show evolved.

The Corpse Vanishes opens with the short serial film ""Radar Men From The Moon"" which I thought was pretty entertaining all by itself but of course you get your supplemental wisecracks from Joel and co.,...""signal your intent"" as a slow-moving space ship jockeys for take off. Loved the space man costumes. But the main course, of course is the Corpse Vanishes starring Bela Lugosi as a polite bride killer foiled by perky cub reporter Pat Hunter played by Luana Walters. Walters got me through this creaking slow boat to China seeming to be the only character with a pulse! Joel does get some good lines in: ""dr. Lorenze is a doctor himself but he has no license to practise""-Joel:""making him a quack"" and Crow: ""how do I know the rest isn't a cockeyed nightmare?""-Crow:""or a nighteyed cockmare"" but I was REALLY put to sleep with first season's Josh Weinstein voicing Tom Servo as if he were in a club-bludgeoned trance. I could not WAIT to return to a non-season 1 episode to get my Murphy/Servo back! Joel treats us with a perfect Lugosi impression which, actually, isn't THAT hard to duplicate but still-very fun! The intermission skits were dull as dishwater with the exception of Joel and the mad's invention exchange(check the related media box 4 above).I did like Shout Factory's inclusion of two trailers for The Middle Man(had not heard of this and the actress reminds me of Janeane Garofalo) and Parker Lewis Can't Lose sets. My overall feeling for this disc is the short and the feature were good enough on their own to watch even without the MST-freshmen quips and delivery of, but they DO get in some good zingers here and there so you really can't lose either way you slice it.

Disc #2-Warrior of the Lost World
Host segments/all good and Warrior from season 5 is artfully, skillfully, comically(of course)and masterfully skewered by Joel, Tom and Crow. TWO bonus features-1. an enlightening interview with Warrior director David Worth (less) and 2. production stills described by David. Many many laughs are to be had listening to the crew jag this film and Crow's impersonations of a Scot race car announcer, Charles Nelson Reilly and Redd Foxx are as accurate as can be. Joel,Tom and Crow's mimicking of Donald Pleasance, Ginty and Persis all are wonderfully executed too! Tom's introduction speech in skit 1 is hilarious. The slot car skit (""HOT SLOT BOTS!!"") (""I couldn't beat Margaret Dumont!""-Servo)and the piano lounge/Crow as Mrs. Warrior skit are priceless. Clayton and Frank's Square Master demo, perfectly excellent too-I especially love the writing for this with Dr. Forrester narrating as Frank gets all hot and sweaty using his new exercising tool. Good Joel episode...for those in doubt. His and Tom's Scope/Robitusson dissertation in the dance club scene is awe-inspiring it's so professionally and cooly delivered. Entertainingly funny from start to finish. Warrior of the Lost World theme music though-bleeeeeeeech!

Santa Claus also from season 5 I didn't like first time through. I gave it another whirl and the 2nd time through I have to admit it WAS funnier. Not the film-the boys ribbing of. ""Santa! Santa! Hey Kringle,snap out of it!!""-Crow. When Satan's assistant Pitch is seen shivering on a freezing rooftop waiting to sabatoge Santa coming to deliver his bag of toys, his teeth chattering, his arms shaking from the cold, Mike says ""come on Santa, I need some stuff man! Just a taste man!!"" The first time through, I thought the film just dragged so much that even the boys' zingers just kind of sat there but with a second viewing,everything seemed to fall in to place much better. The bonus feature ""Santa Claus conquers the Devil:A 50-year Retropsective""is excellent.

Last disc Night of the Blood Beast was the jewel in this box, for me.
From season #7, it opens with a short film called Once Upon a Honeymoon that is pure delight! This is MST3K in high gear as far as I'm concerned. The film is a fresh nostalgic dollop of sugar, in color and Mike and co., tweak its good natured by-gone zest with aplomb.
If disc 4 contained JUST this short film and nothing else I'd be very content. But then, yes then, comes......Night of the Blood Beast. ""be vairwee vairwee qwiet, we're hunting bwud beasts eh eh eh ""-Tom. The crew is REALLY sharp this movie-like their energy level is a high as I've yet encountered AND you can tell they're having FUN doing it, not just reciting the lines ala Corpse. The on-going 'Steve' jokes/the constant mimicking of the photographer girl/""what's happening in there?""-""oh Big Spring dance.""-Tom/""ladder that same evening""-Mike. When one of the characters in the movie says ""snarf farms"" the tears were rolling down my cheeks! ""you sly boots!"" This episode of MST3K has the highest ratio of dead-on jokes per square inch of any episode I've yet watched. I also noticed the guys love of food placement mentions throughout the movie which I'm sure goes on during other episodes too but this is the first time I saw the trend. ""My brownies are gone!"" ""There's gotta be a Pizza Hut nearby!"" ""...oh and snacks and brews and a couple of sandwiches...."" ""this was in my tuna"" ""wait! there's one last piece of carrot cake and I'm gonna grab it!"" one of the characters in the movie says ""Lights out?"" and Mike thinks he's said ""loin chop??"" ""you think I get hush puppies and cole slaw with these?""  Pringles and egg salad .....the list is long! But be that as it may, Night of the Blood Beast and its superb opening short film scores very very high in the land of MST3K, and as I say, the jewel of this set, with Warrior of the Lost World coming in at a solid #2. Corpse is a good episode that gives the fan a taste of early MST style and Santa Claus, after a slow start, only gets better with each viewing.",1263772800,2,6105,4.739416745061147
8375340,5,B002NS5HOQ,"MST3K (and it's off-shoot, Riff Trax) is one of the greatest franchises in entertainment history.
I can't even find my way out of bed without wisecracking robots riffing on my pitiable foibles since I saw my first one.
No, really, I have a serious neurological problem and I actively blame the producers of this DVD for the anguish that is my every day life.
Good graphics on the box, though.",1516838400,,392,4.614285714285714
8375341,4,B002NS5HOQ,"The Corpse Vanishes is pretty unwatchable.  It's a Season 1, so work in process.

Warriors of the Lost World - classic.  The Paper Chase guy.  Megaweapon.

Santa Claus - a very disturbing movie on multiple levels.

Night of the Blood Beast - I'll never think of Roger Corman the same after finding out about the script writer not being credited.

Enjoyable special features.",1502150400,,374,4.841269841269841
