1408866,3,B000059PPV,"First, a word of warning: if you think Texas Adios is another of those ultra-violent, stylized spaghetti westerns, you may be disappointed. On the other hand, if you like your westerns on the melodramatic side, you'll enjoy this movie. In fact, this one has a more ""classic"" feel than say ""Django"", as Franco Nero himself pointed out in an interview included on the DVD. Away from the always dependable Nero, the movie lacks a good, charismatic villain a la Gian Maria Volonte and the acting level is undistinguished. I did enjoy watching Nero in the most stylish leather trench coat this side of the Rio Grande !",996105600,5,613,4.738317757009346
1408867,4,B000059PPV,"It's great to finally get this wonderful Franco Nero Spaghetti Western on DVD.  Anamorphic widescreen is the only format any serious fan of the genre should watch this great revenge story of a tough gun-man who, together with his younger brother, goes to Mexico to find the man who killed his father many years ago. This movie has everything somebody expects from a great Spaghetti Western, great direction by Ferdinando Baldi, great looking actors and a beautiful score by Anton Garcia Abril. This is the way, an entertaining Spaghetti Western should be made.",995846400,4,560,5.021505376344086
1408878,3,B000059PPV,"European star Franco Nero may always be remembered for his roles in Sergio Corbucci's movies, Django, Sergei Kowalski, Yodlaf Peterson, but he made a handful of other spaghetti westerns worth watching, this one included.  Nero plays Burt Sullivan, a sheriff of a Texas border town. But one day, he decides to leave the town and ride into Mexico in search of Cisco Delgado, the man who gunned down his father many years before.  Tagging along with Burt is his younger brother, Jim, who's inexperienced but still good with a gun.  The two brothers find out that Delgado has made quite a life for himself, basically ruling a Mexican town and his large estate with an iron hand.  Burt wants to bring him back to Texas to face a judge, but upon meeting him discovers a huge secret that could tear him and his brother apart.  An early spaghetti western from 1966, Texas, Adios could have passed for an American western in many ways.  It doesn't have that dark, cynical feel that many later spaghettis did, but it's still a good movie for fans of the genre.  Lots of good action with plenty of fistfights and shootouts.  The music is good, especially the main theme, but the Texas, Adios song is pretty bad.  Fans of spaghetti westerns won't be disappointed, there's plenty here to recommend.

  Right up there with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as some of the biggest spaghetti stars, Franco Nero is very good here as Burt Sullivan, the Texas lawman seeking vengeance on his father's murderer.  Nero was always good as the smart-mouthed gunman, here he's more serious, but his role is strong just the same.  And if nothing else, it's fun to see Nero as a lawman for once, not an outlaw/bandit.  Alberto Dell'Acqua, credited as Cole Kitosch, plays Jim, Burt's younger brother who tags along with his brother into Mexico.  Jose Suarez gets to be the villain here as Cisco Delgado, the man who killed the Sullivan's father and now is a wealthy landowner.  Delgado isn't a typical spaghetti bad guy, but that has to do with the twist delivered about an hour in.  The rest of the cast includes some recognizable faces from the more mainstream Italian westerns including Luigi Pistilli, Livio Lorenzon, Elisa Montes, Jos Guardiola, Gino Pernice, and Silvana Bacci.

  The Blue Underground DVD is a welcome addition to any DVD collection with a sharp looking widescreen presentation, ""Back in the Saddle with Franco Nero,"" a six-minute interview with Nero about his experiences in Italian westerns, a trailer, and a detailed Nero bio in menu form.  Also worth mentioning, Italian audio and English subtitles are included because the dub isn't one of the best.  So for an exciting spaghetti western led by Franco Nero, check out Texas, Adios!",1221609600,2,2731,4.813304721030043
1408879,3,B000059PPV,"This is a revenge Western,and was indeed called The Avenger on its original US release .It is more akin to a standard American western of the period than to the Leone -Corbucci school of Italian Westerns and lacks the rococo plotting and stylistic flourishes that were the signatures of these two maestros of the sub-genre.
Franco Nero plays a Texan lawman Burt Sullivan who is intent on avenging the murder some years earlier of his father by a man named Cisco Delgado (Jose Suarez).His reluctantly agrees  to his more headstrong younger brother Jim (Cole Kitasch)going along on the trip .
Delagado is now a wealthy man in Mexico with numerous hirelings to protect him from any attack and a short way with opposition. He reveals to Kennedy that Jim is  his son and tries to persuade him to abandon his vengeance plans

The movie lacks the extreme close ups and long drawn out  set pieces of many key works in the sub-genre and is efficiently and unfussily directed by Ferdinando Baldi .It might well have gained from some of the darker comedic touches which periodically enlivened many European Westerns of the era. Even so it is a watchable movie with an over familiar plot matybe ,but still a capably delivered Western with Nero's formidable presence a decided asset",1199750400,,1269,4.807339449541284
1408880,4,B000059PPV,"Franco Nero heads down to Mexico to snag the guy who killed his father years back, so he can stand trial in Texas.  Nero's brother tags along as well.  The villain's now living like a king down in Mexico and practically runs the whole town, so he's certainly not gonna just let Nero take him that easily. But we all know that what Franco wants, Franco gets.  In true James Bond tradition, the villain invites Nero and his brother to dinner instead of just having them killed on the spot.  Why?  A twist in the plot, that's why!  There's more to the relationship between the brothers and the villain that meets the eye.  There's also some revolutionaries plotting a big attack, much to Nero's advantage.  As stated before, this spaghetti western has more in common with the American westerns of the time.  This is one of the few times you'll see Nero as a lawman rather than an outlaw.  While it may not be Django or Keoma, this is a very good and worthy addition to the world of spaghetti westerns.",1175472000,,998,4.464088397790055
1408881,2,B000059PPV,"I was hoping for some more Django-esk fun, but it is not here. The character playing Franco's brother was goofy! The action was pretty good but sadly not enough was here. The DVD quality is good.",1173484800,,195,4.444444444444445
1408882,3,B000059PPV,"Hi

This movie is OK, but not great quality. It does attempt to do something but lacks the real grit.",1163548800,,101,4.05
1408883,4,B000059PPV,"Spaghetti westerns are, in my opinion, generally the best fictional films about the American West. You can argue that John Wayne made a bunch of great movies about life in the Old West, and you would be right to say so, but for some reason the Italians captured perfectly the specific elements of the era that made their movies seem more realistic. The frontier was a dirty, violent place full of unsavory types trying to get rich quick. Italian westerns capture this mood expertly whereas American films portray characters whose outfits look like they just came back from the dry cleaners. Hollywood films also tend to apply a black and white dichotomy onto their characters, the old ""good guys wear white, bad guys wear black"" philosophy that obscures the reality of the time and place. Not so in Italian films, where even the good guys often have distinctly unsavory traits. It's too bad spaghetti westerns went the way of the dinosaurs a few decades back; I never tire of watching these films even though I am not an expert on the genre. ""Texas, Adios"" is a part of the larger Anchor Bay ""Once Upon a Time in Italy"" spaghetti western box set, and serves as an excellent example of how powerful the genre once was.

The always awesome Franco Nero stars as Burt Sullivan, a slightly corrupt Texas sheriff with a fast gun and a chip on his shoulder. According to this lawman, his father died years before as a direct result of a confrontation with Cisco Delgado (Jose Suarez), a man who then moved to Mexico to build a small empire. Sullivan spends years stewing about revenge until he suddenly learns of his nemesis's whereabouts. Taking his younger brother Jim (Alberto Dell'Acqua) along for the ride, Sullivan bids adios to Texas and heads south of the border. Life threatening calamities pop up right from the start. When cashing in silver coins for pesos at a bank in a small village, Burt and Jim witness a gang of desperados gun down a bunch of meek peasants. Then a particularly loathsome looking thug beats young Jim Sullivan senseless in a bar after the youth makes a loud inquiry about the location of Delgado. Burt roars to the rescue, leaving behind a pile of bodies and a warning about staying out of other people's business, but the point has been made. Obviously, Delgado is a man of some reputation in the area, and even asking about him in the wrong company will result in extreme violence.

We soon learn exactly why everyone fears Delgado so much. It turns out that this guy owns a ton of land in Northern Mexico, employs a huge army of goons to enforce his iron will, and wishes to build even more wealth. When a local peasant refuses to sell out to Delgado, the warlord strings up the man's three sons and threatens to kill them. Relenting at the last moment, he orders them branded with hot irons instead. Nice chap, eh? He gets the land eventually by pistol whipping and killing the father. Burt and Jim eventually do face down this cruel hombre after a lengthy journey fraught with perils, but both find out that their old enemy has a few secrets up his sleeve. Burt wishes to take the warlord back to Texas in order to face charges for his father's murder, a wish leading to a shattering revelation from Delgado. Jim, on the other hand, soon discovers that the man he and his brother despise knows something about his lineage that could dash cold water all over the idea of bloody retribution. Nothing is what it initially seems in ""Texas, Adios,"" as even the bad guy possesses endearing traits that make justice at best a tricky proposition. Fortunately, plenty of shootouts, a peasant uprising, and a high body count help propel the movie to its inevitable showdown conclusion.

""Texas, Adios"" is an early spaghetti western. Made a year after Sergio Corbucci's innovative ""Django"" (also starring Franco Nero), the film contains in embryonic form many of the ideas we would see later on in countless other genre entries. For example, the moral ambiguity of both the good and bad characters are on full display here. Too, there's a thread of cruelty--the branding scene, the killing of innocent civilians--in the film that tells the audience immediately this picture is not your normal western. Of course the dubbing, particularly bad in this film, would never appear in an American film about the Old West. Simultaneously, ""Texas, Adios"" contains many elements that link it to classic American westerns. The musical score used for the picture doesn't sound anything like the great scores of later films composed by the likes of Ennio Morricone. The general look and feel of the movie resembles more an episode of ""Gunsmoke"" or ""Bonanza"" than it does an Italian genre flick. ""Texas, Adios"" is obviously a film straddling the increasingly blurry line between the American and Italian western genres.

The DVD contains a beautiful widescreen picture transfer, a six-minute interview with Franco Nero, and a trailer for the movie. Nero, outside of Clint Eastwood, is perhaps the most recognizable face in this cinematic genre. While I don't think anyone would say ""Texas, Adios"" is Nero's best work spaghetti western role (he's much, much better in ""Companeros""), it's still fun to watch the man gun down the baddies and right wrongs. When I think about how many Italian westerns are floating around out there, yet to find a DVD release, I feel immensely disappointed. It's to Anchor Bay's credit that they released ANY of these films, let alone a great boxed set of some of the best entries in the genre. Fans will definitely want to check out this collection. Here's to hoping more of these films will soon emerge on DVD.",1093910400,13,5647,4.776867963152507
1408884,5,B000059PPV,Terrific fast paced and tightly plotted spaghetti western directed by Fernando Baldi.  Franco Nero is the second greatest western actor next to Clint Eastwood.  Great score and some potent shootouts.  A well rounded film with an interesting thematic message on retribution and vengeance that rings true throughout.  One of the best italian westerns I have ever seen.,1082592000,6,366,5.368421052631579
1408885,5,B000059PPV,"OK. So there's no way you can claim this is a classic. The dialogue is shocking (but that's the case with  most spaghetti westerns). But I'm going to give it 5 stars for sheer enjoyment value. Like the great spaghetti westerns of the mid sixties (Navajo Joe, Django, the Leone trilogy, The Hills Run Red, Death Rides a Horse), Texas Adio starts with a hiss and a roar and just keeps on going at a break-neck pace, building up to what has to be one of the loudest gunfights in western history. The action is brutal and frequent as in all classic spaghettis, although the tone and manner is more like those big boisterous American westerns of the forties and fifties. I''ve only seen this on a wiedescreen version from the UK, so I can't comment on the DVD extras. But get it for the film content alone. it's one of the best.",1053216000,2,823,4.379084967320262
1408886,3,B000059PPV,"Franco Nero is surely one of the pleasures of this film-- or rather, watching Nero before he started to parody the types of roles that made him famous in the first place (as he would soon do in Corbucci's work).  Nero's carefully controlled performance (indeed, he seems to be modelling his persona after a Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda, or early Burt Lancaster)lends gravity to a *very* thin plotline (sheriff Nero and his younger brother head south to finally find their father's murderer who [surprise!] turns out to be the younger brother's actual dad).  Unfortunately, the generally good acting can't always hide the fact that there just isn't anything behind these stereotypes.  If ""For a Few Dollars More"" (which, in an interview on the DVD, Nero mentions was filmed at the same time as ""Adios"") Leone was busy sending up the American western and consequently helping to forge a new genre, then writer/director Ferdinando Baldi was a bit too busy trying to fit every possible stock character into this ""Americanized"" spaghetti western--his screenplay just can't  support the burden of his Oedipalized, archetypal tale.  Even the superior music score seems a faithful copy of Elmer Bernstein or Max Steiner rather than a unique Morricone-like ""homage"".  The outstanding photography (perfectly captured by this flawless anamorphic widescreen print)also helps to make up for some of the erratic pacing. In short, not a particularly inventive spaghetti Western, but fun viewing.",1032566400,5,1476,5.259574468085106
1408887,5,B000059PPV,"I keep saying this but nobody seems to know what I am going on about: This must be 'the other' big influence on the original Star Wars film! The first being ""The Hidden Fortress"" which Lucas has credited. But as far as I know has never credited this.
Has anybody else spotted the 'cantina' scene (pistols instead of light sabres) - or the 'old ben' character in the desert... or the son going to avenge his father's death then finding out that... well you know the rest. There's a whole bunch of other bits you'll recognise too even if you're not a Star Wars nerd. The lead character even looks a bit like Luke Skywalker!
Besides that, it's a great film with a great score and beautifully shot.
This, along with Django, Bullet for the General (Quien Sabe), Compaeros, are all glorious in their own ways (and available on DVD!) but my favourite - just because it's a film like no other is The Great Silence... BUY IT NOW!!!",1005264000,10,922,4.461538461538462
7933985,4,B000059PPV,"This is a spaghetti-type western with most of what one would expect in such westerns. Viewers who enjoy spaghetti westerns will definitely like this one. It is not as good as the Clint Eastwood westerns or those by Van Cleef. Unfortunately, too many things stand out as impossible to make the film perfect, such as guns that never run out of bullets or why our hero waited so many years before he decided to take revenge on the man who killed his father.
It is about a very successful sheriff who is quick on the draw and never misses when he shoots, except in a gun battle where the director of the film wanted the film to have more suspense. He decides to go from Texas to Mexico to find the man who killed his dad and bring him to Texas to trial. His kid brother who seems to be about 18 years old, who is also a quick draw and hits his target, wants to go along, and the sheriff agrees.
They find the man but then need to face many dozens of his thugs and the two learn something that would shake-up anyone.",1489363200,,1011,4.18974358974359

7933988,4,B000059PPV,"The movie ""Adios Texas"" is a revenge tale about 2 brothers Burt and Jim Sullivan(Franco Nero and Cole Kitosch) On the trail of the man who betrayed and murdered their father years earlier. It's directed by Ferdinando Baldi and the movie isn't bad. It's got a decent amount of action in it and it has a decent plot too. I was a little leary about buying it but i'm glad i did. Blue underground did a fine job with the film. The picture looks great. It's in wide screen, you have both english and italian sound tracks and it has subtittles. The extras are ok. You have the Franco Nero bio, the theatrical trailer and a 6 minute interview with the star. I wish the interview was longer but no real complaints.",1404259200,,706,4.356060606060606
7933989,4,B000059PPV,"Franco Nero stars in this simple, basic, and enjoyable Euro Western from the same year of his superior and most well known film, Django. Nero plays a sheriff who teams up with his younger brother to hunt down their father's killer in Mexico. As they arrive in Mexico, they find that the law there does not exist and that the man responsible for their father's death does not play games. Nero and his brother rack up the kills all backed by a serviceable soundtrack and a cool theme song. Nero's acrobatics during some of the gunfights is truly exhilarating stuff. The final shootout features him jumping behind cover and rolling and leaping. The story is not incredible but does a fine job keeping you invested during the down times. This is not iconic Euro Western territory, but it is not crappy no effort whatsoever territory either.

So I'll say this. If you enjoy Spaghetti/Euro Westerns, sweet gun play, or Franco Nero, no doubt give this a try. The DVD comes with the original Italian Audio which is nice. You also get a Franco Nero bio, a trailer, and a short but recommended 5 minute interview with Franco Nero on his Western career. It's a cheap DVD, under $10 always. With its clear case and cool cover, give this a buy. The film is a solid 8/10 and you won't be disappointed.",1387843200,,1287,4.571428571428571

7933992,2,B000059PPV,"Another Franco Nero spaghetti Western yarn (and there are many of these). Franco Nero, with his deep eyes and rugged five o'clock shadow, is usually at his best when portraying another stoic man of the wild west. This isn't one of those films. Nero's casting isn't the issue. Rather, it seems the direction is; it seems the director asked Nero to play too much into his usual, icy cool. Nero seems to be going through the motions, his character failing to react to scenes but rather just being there. His brother's character development - whose role was portrayed by Zac Efron - was much more interesting and barely exposed. Some scenes, like that of the mayor rounding up citizens and executing them with the mayor explaining his reasons why, hinted at the film's potential. But this was never explored. Same for the the scene where a lawyer asks for Nero's help in revolution. The twist was welcome but, again, nothing came of it. Overall, a film only for fans of Franco Nero, for there is really nothing else within the film to commend it",1295827200,,1041,4.663043478260869
7933993,3,B000059PPV,"TEXAS ADIOS comes with a good pedigree: DJANGO-era Franco Nero, director Ferdinando Baldi of VIVA DJANGO and BLINDMAN. Despite this, the film turns out a little leaden and melodramatic with long gaps between bursts of action. Nero, playing a sheriff, leaves his Texas town to cross into Mexico to find the man who killed his father years ago. Nero's kid brother tags along for the sole purpose of being the subject of a soap-opera-style plot twist late in the film. The disc, by Anchor Bay, looks great; and the original Italian audio is available, always a plus. However, the proceedings, despite being nicely shot, are a little wanting and lifeless. The great Nero seems to be going through the paces a little. A better option from Nero's catalog is MASSACRE TIME; Baldi was much better with the aforementioned VIVA DJANGO. Check one of those out instead.",1267574400,,857,4.876712328767123
