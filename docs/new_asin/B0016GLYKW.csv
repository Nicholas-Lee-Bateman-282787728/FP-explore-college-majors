8262453,4,B0016GLYKW,"This 57 minute DVD consists of performances recorded at the Cheyenne Saloon at the Church Street Station entertainment complex in Orlando Florida during the 1980s for a cable TV show.  The title is a bit misleading because, while 7 or 8 of the women had major careers, some of the others were more opening acts, though they can sing.

Its sort of a time capsule of that period when you see how  many of these women have the big frizzy hairdos of the period. Lynn Andersons isn't frizzy but her hair style sure is strange!

It was interesting to see Kathy Mattea in her pre-stardom state before she hit it big and Tanya Tucker was actually in her mature period then. Most don't sing their big hits. Tammy Wynette sings Woman Hood, not Stand By Your Man. We don't see Dolly Parton but get her sister Stella instead.

The sound is decent. Because this was before wide screen TVs the screen ratio aspect is the standard 4:3.

Based on the reviews here this was forst released on DVD in 2006 but it is being released again in 2014 by Music Video Distributors.

For the list price its good value for anyone who remembers the country stars (and almost-stars) of the 1980s.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8262458,5,B0016GLYKW,"I'm glad I got this.  Some of these artists I had never seen before, but they are all good.
Unfortunately, real country music has seemed to have all but disappeared, and so if you want to see what passes for genuine country singing, as close to the original style of country music as we're ever likely to see, especially from the newer acts, we'd better latch on to as much of the old-type stuff as possible.
It's wonderful to have available so many of the old country singers on CD, but it would be fantastic to be able to see them on DVD, and not in the old black-and-white stuff that we sometimes see, but as modern and slick, as far as the production, as the newer DVDs are.
Of course, that's not going to happen, because those old stars passed away without making any films, or precious few, and we just have to settle for their CDs.",1338076800,4,838,4.30379746835443
8262459,4,B0016GLYKW,As expected this DVD is a compilation most enjoyable as it contains many tracks performed by the country singers I was brought up with. The sound is as good as can be expected for recordings done during this period,1301529600,,214,4.512820512820513
