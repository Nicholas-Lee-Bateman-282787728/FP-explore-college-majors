3842897,5,B0024396DI,"The five films that the other reviewer mentioned are accompanied by a bonus disc of yet undisclosed extra features. No box set has yet been dedicated to Jack Lemmon, and it is about time.

Don't judge this set by some of Sony's early ventures into classic films. I have some DVDs made by Sony early in this century that look like VHS transfers or something that was projected against a bedsheet. However, Sony has begun to turn the corner with such outstanding entries as the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cary-Grant-Box-Set-Holiday-Only-Angels-Have-Wings-The-Talk-of-the-Town-His-Girl-Friday-The-Awful-Truth/dp/B000CEV3L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cary Grant Box Set (Holiday / Only Angels Have Wings / The Talk of the Town / His Girl Friday / The Awful Truth)</a>.

1954's Phffft has the great chemistry of Judy Holliday and Jack Lemmon in a film that examines how you deal with somebody that gets on your nerves yet is in your blood at the same time. Jack Carson plays his usual bad influence part as Lemmon's friend.

I haven't seen Operation Madball in years. As I remember, it was no Mister Roberts, but it had a madcap air about it as a bunch of servicemen compete for the attention of only a few nurses. I particularly remember a piece of dark humor not typical for 50's comedies in which Jack Lemmon tries to convince one of the other servicemen that he buried a man alive.

""The Notorious Landlady"" is another one that I haven't seen in years. I have to admit I remember it more because of Fred Astaire than Jack Lemmon. It was one of his roles after he ceased being a purely musical talent. Jack Lemmon plays an American who rents a room in London when his job brings him there. However, not until he has signed the lease and begun to fall in love with the landlady (Kim Novak) does he find out that everyone including the authorities believe that she has killed her husband. However a body has never been found, and this has caused her to be ostracized, but not arrested. Plus there are plenty of mysterious goings on in the house in the middle of the night. It is a kind of ""The Lodger"" in reverse.

""Under the Yum Yum Tree"" IMHO, is quite a bust. Jack Lemmon plays the leacherous type in several films and does it well. However, this is usually because underneath his actions is some virtue just waiting to get out. The person he plays here has no depth, just a desire for more female conquest. It is a so-called comedy about Lemmon's character making play after play for a woman who is living with her boyfriend in a trial marriage without s ex. I guess one bad film out of five isn't bad.

""Good Neighbor Sam"" is the kind of part Jack Lemmon usually did so well under the direction of Billy Wilder - a good guy caught up in larger events that forces him into ridiculous actions in hilarious situations. Here Jack plays a family man who hates his job. However, he wins a promotion based on the fact that the boss wants a well-behaved family man in the job and Jack is the only guy in the company that fits the bill. This is complicated when his wife's friend inherits fifteen million - if she is married. A funny turn of events has Jack playing the heiress' husband to the other potential heirs, who are keeping a solid eye on the situation and Jack, at the same time he is trying to not look like a two-timer to his boss.

Four out of five of these films are definite keepers, plus there is the bonus disc. This set is probably 4.5 out of 5, but I'm rounding it up to a five.",1238803200,38,3539,4.634768740031898
3842918,5,B0024396DI,"Unlike so many other's who've docked stars from this package due to the stutter in quality control about the labelling of the disc's, let me just point out that the end product is a wonderful treat. I am a huge Jack Lemmon fan, and even though his most famous films like ,Some Like It Hot, or Mister Roberts ,are not included in this collection, what I did find were a nice collection of films where Jack is playing his lovable, silly, romantic comedy roles. Jack had a way to make each film his own, and his characters are always my favourite in each film.
I gave this package the full five stars because it is an excellent cross section of 5 of the films that get the least attention from most film critics when chatting about Jack Lemmon's legendary career. It's a nice fold out package, the photos are excellent, and the bonus disc from Jack's son Chris (including never before seen photos, with interviews) is a nice treat for the true Jack Lemmon fan.

3842945,5,B0024396DI,"Finally one of my all-time favorite films, ""Good Neighbor Sam,"" is available on DVD.  I remember as a child in the '60s going with my parents to Kansas City and seeing this in one of the elegant theaters on the Plaza there at that time.  Even though it's a film aimed primarily at adults, I laughed my head off.  Later I saw it on TV and was still rolling on the floor laughing.  I must be the target audience for the humor in this film, and I'm glad I am because of the pleasant memories. I was looking and waiting for it to be released on DVD, thinking it might never happen because time marches on and people forget. But here it is, and I bought the collection for this one movie alone (and it's in widescreen!). I really enjoyed the other films in the collection as well, especially ""The Notorious Landlady.""",1273536000,2,812,4.322368421052632
3842946,3,B0024396DI,"Well, here it is, almost a year later from its expensive release, and Sony is selling the mislabeled disc collection (hmmm, has a nice ring to it, though).

Every movie does not match the DVD's label  - Disc 2 is really ""Good Neighbor Sam"" though it's labeled ""Operation Mad Ball.""  Disc 5 is labeled ""Good Neighbor Sam,"" but it's really ""Operation Mad Ball"".  And the confusion just continues through the other discs.  Time to get out the DVD Felt Pen Marker.

What makes this mishap particularly irritating is that the Root Menu/Title Screen for each DVD does NOT tell you the name of the movie.  Just ""Play movie"" or ""Languages"" or ""Select Scenes.""  It's bad enough that every disc is mislabeled, but to not even tell you on the Main Title root menu what the name of the movie is?  You have to actually start each movie to see which one it is.

I bought this set for one movie only, ""Good Neighbor Sam,"" and I must say the transfer was poor.  Couldn't Sony have at least cleaned the print before transferring it to DVD?

Jack Lemmon (and his fans) deserve better.",1273276800,27,1066,4.494791666666667
3842947,4,B0024396DI,"Jack Lemmon is one of the actors who immediately caught my attention when I began watching classic movies more seriously as a high school senior.  The word 'genius' is so overused that its meaning has denigrated to the point where the label is meaningless, so I can't say Jack Lemmon is a 'genius', but films like THE APARTMENT, SOME LIKE IT HOT, THE ODD COUPLE, AVANTI, MISTER ROBERTS, and DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES make a strong case for Lemmon as one of the most charismatic and accomplished actors of that time period.

Unfortunately, the films on this collection do not give Lemmon the opportunity to exhibit that quality.  The best you could say about some of them is that they are above average for the studio they come from, Columbia, the weakest 'sister' of old Hollywood.  PHFFFT! is arguably the best picture, and even that is just a merely enjoyable light-hearted comedy. (Kim Novak is a real scream in it too.)  Many of them seem very overlong for what the story actually requires; THE NOTORIOUS LANDLADY and GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM in particular could have been much tighter, funnier pictures if Richard Quine or David Swift could wrap the things up in about twenty less minutes.  UNDER THE YUM YUM TREE is fairly lame, and I found OPERATION MAD BALL to be a waste of time.  Even so, Lemmon gives what is required of these pictures: a solid, funny everyman performance, and it's fairly obvious he's phoning in a lot of it.  You will probably be satisfied with this set if you don't go into it expecting Daphne or Felix Ungar quality from him.

The transfers of all the movies are fine and crisp, and it's hard to demand better when the actual movies really don't warrant it.  The documentary ""Jack Lemmon-The Man Behind the Magic"" is a joke; good firsthand anecdotes, but Joe Baltake basically spends a fair portion of it telling you why THESE films are all so special and worth buying, mentioning several times that it's a thrill having all of these available for the first time on home video.  It's a thinly veiled ad trying to reassure buyers of the set that their money was well spent.

This set is definitely NOT for the casual movie fan, at least not at this point.  Even for its target audience, the hardcore classic movie fan, the price tag is far too high for what you're actually getting.  This is really for the Lemmon fan who must have everything.

I would also like to add that my copy (not purchased on Amazon) actually had the discs correctly labeled, so perhaps that problem has been taken care of, though of course I can't guarantee it.  It should be taken care of for what it costs!",1263254400,7,2605,4.56989247311828
3842958,4,B0024396DI,"Just got this set today for $29.99 with free shipping from a competitor, and I can confirm the discs are mislabeled.  First one I put in was labeled ""Good Neighbor Sam"", but it is actually ""Operation Mad Ball"". So a little homework with a felt-tipped pen was needed. For the price I got this set of 6 discs for, I am not going to get too upset about the mixup and lack of quality control. Great transfers and picture quality which is the important thing. 5 Stars, -1 Star for the quality control issue.",1256688000,13,502,4.340425531914893

Let me start by saying thanks to Sony for getting this one right.

The packaging itself is compact and practical, as the five movies and bonus discs are held in a relatively slim fold out box set case. The design itself is also very appealing. The case and DVD's are themed in blues and browns, and the the fold out part of the set has two large portraits of Lemmon. Also, the DVD's are in clear plastic holders allowing you to look behind each DVD to see a poster and picture matching that particular movie. Overall, five stars for the box itself as it is sturdy, compact and attractive.

One of my minor quibbles concerns the title menus of each disc. Each movie is clearly labeled with the title and disc number, however, the tile menu displays do not match the disc numbers. For instance, my ""Operation Mad Ball"" is labeled on the disc as disc two but on the title menu it says disc five. I am not sure if this is a problem specific to my set or if all the sets are like that. However, it really doesn't make any difference as it is just a pointless disc number and since all my discs have the correct movies and corresponding movie labels. The title menus are all very similar and professionally done, though if not a bit lackluster. But once again, nothing really to actually complain about. The one thing I did find quite interesting was that all the movies were divided into 12 scenes; consequently the 130 min long ""Good Neighbor Sam"" has a lot longer scenes then the 88 min ""Phfft!"" Once again, not really an issue, but worth noting in case you have to stop a movie and do scene select. As far as the quality of the transfers themselves, the films all have great image and sound quality. I have a widescreen LCD TV and all of the movies looked quite nicely on it, especially with the 1.85:1 anamorphic aspect ratio. So, for the the production quality of the set, it gets four stars due to the minor disc mislabeling problem.

Now, the movies themselves are all fun and entertaining, and I would watch all of them again with the possible exception of ""Operation Mad Ball."" ""Phfft!"" is a great 50's comedy with Judy Holliday and Kim Novak and revolves around a divorcing couple. The script was pretty witty, and there was a great dance scene with Lemmon and Holliday. I found ""Operation Mad Ball"" to be the least enjoyable of the five as it seemed short on humor as well as short on everything else. There were of course some good moments, but I am not sure if I would ever really watch it again. ""The Notorious Lady"" also stars Kim Novak, as well as Fred Astaire, and was one of my favorites in this bunch even if the tone of the story jumps from mysterious to dramatic to madcap antics. Next is ""Under the Yum Yum Tree"" which may be a bit dated as an over-the-top 60's ""sex comedy,"" but it still was enjoyable and I got quite a bit of laughs from the ""unique"" character that Lemmon plays. ""Good Neighbor Sam"" is the final film, and in my opinion, the best. It is a wonderfully fun and original story with a bit of kitschy wife swapping mixed in, and to top it off, Edward G. Robinson makes a much appreciated appearance as Lemmon's boss. Some might label these films as sub-par Lemmon, which they might be compared to some of his collaborations with Billy Wilder, but they definitely get a five star rating from me.

The set also has a bonus disc with a 45 min documentary on Jack Lemmon that touches a little on the films in the set. There is also the obligatory original theatrical trailers as well as an episode of Ford All-Star Theatre starring Lemmon and Ida Lupino on the ""Phfft!"" disc. Considering we are lucky to have these films even released on DVD at all, and knowing Sony, I was surprised there was any extras at all let alone a full length documentary on Lemmon. 5 stars for the extras.

This a great set, and one definitely worth owning. I would highly recommend this to people who aren't too familiar with Jack Lemmon as this set definitely made a fan out of me.

3842965,3,B0024396DI,"""The Jack Lemmon Film Collection"" contains five features starring Lemmon made in a ten-year period.

""Phffft!"" (1954) co-stars Judy Holiday, Best Actress Academy Award-winner for ""Born Yesterday.""  The screen chemistry between Holiday and Lemmon raises this often routine romantic comedy to a higher plane.  Robert and Nina divorce after eight years of marriage.  Robert hangs out with womanizing Navy pal Charlie Nelson (Jack Carson), while Nina looks to her interfering Mom for guidance.  Both start seeing other people, but it seems the path of true love leads right back to a familiar place.  Look for Kim Novak in her first featured role.

""Operation Mad Ball"" (1957) takes a screwball look at a party planned by a group of service men and their ongoing efforts to keep it a secret from an obnoxious officer, Capt. Locke (Ernie Kovacs).  Lemmon is Pvt. Hogan, who balances this deception with his romancing of Lt. Betty Bixby (Kathryn Grant).  Mickey Rooney and Dick York co-star.

By the time Ms. Novak re-teamed with Lemmon in 1962 for ""The Notorious Landlady,"" her star had risen considerably.  She had starred in ""Picnic,"" ""The Man With the Golden Arm,"" ""Pal Joey,"" and ""Vertigo.""  Lemmon is William Gridley, newly arrived in London  from the United States.  He rents part of Carly Hardwicke's (Novak) house and promptly falls in love with her.  But she has a clouded past.  Many believe she's killed her husband, and that leads to farcical plot turns deftly handled by Lemmon.  Fred Astaire co-stars.

The other titles in the set are ""Under the Yum Yum Tree"" (1963, co-starring Carol Lynley) and ""Good Neighbor Sam"" (1964, with Romy Schneider).  The features in this collection do not represent the best of Jack Lemmon's screen work, but they're pleasant, if not inspired.

Bonus extras include the documentary ""Jack Lemmon: The Man Behind the Magic,"" narrated by son Chris; a vintage photo gallery; and an episode of Ford All-Star Theater, ""Marriageable Male.""",1247270400,5,1971,5.080996884735202
3842966,2,B0024396DI,"What were they thinking (other than how to make money)when they compiled this collection?  Without exception, all the films that were chosen are all run of the mill and do not show the depth of the Lemmon's ability.  He was much more than just a gifted comedian; unfortunately, with the films in this collection you never see his true comedic gift and you see none of this dramatic ability.  These movies should be included in collections, but they do not warrant their own collection.  I feel that the fans were cheated when this set was created.  When you look at other collections by other stars this is an over-priced collection of second-rate and third-rate films.

The Notorious Landlady has an excellent pedigree but comes off as both forced and budget-starved,  Fred Astaire is almost completely wasted, as Lionel Jeffries and Kim Novak cannot seem to grasp the ambiguities of her role as Lemmon's landlady. Despite Lemmon's solid acting, the film never quite draws us into the mystery romance.  The only thing that does work in this film is George Dunnig's musical score.

Good Neighbor Sam seems like a sequel to The Apartment, (a film that should have been in this collection, but is not).  It has a clever script, but is loses itself when it tries to appeal to ""The Moral America's"" of the mid 60's; and today's world it just seems mendacious.

Phffft is no classic and it's only satisfying if you are a fan of Lemmon and Holiiday.

Under the Yum Yum Tree is nicely produced and well cast, but the story comes off as both distasteful and hackneyed.

Operation Mad Ball is the standard ""service comedy"" film popular in the late 50's through the mid 60's, in which the enlisted men try to pull scams and pranks on dense officers.  Practically all the men on the base are involved in wild schemes which range from stealing supplies, to faking an illness to get cozy with a cute nurse, to getting bodies in and out of the morgue.

At this price, the collection should have included at least two great films, three would have been better.  It's not as if they didn't have a plethora to choose from; (Mr. Roberts, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, The Odd Couple, Irma la Douce, China Syndrome. Grumpy Old Men) are the first that come to mind.  If they had chosen films that spanned his entire career as fillers, (Missing, Bell Book and Candle, My Fellow Americans, Grumpier Old Men) the collection would have been better.  This viewer can only hope that there will be other collections that include better movies and one or more collection that include all the great movies from Jack Lemmon's long, illustrious career.",1246147200,3,2624,4.704595185995624

8350200,2,B0024396DI,"Very few of the titles in this collection merit buying the whole package.  One or two of the movies are even a little bit creepy (especially ""Under The Yum Yum Tree,  voyeurism and really weirdo behavior on the part of Jack Lemmon's character.  I guess it was trying to be hip for its time but it just comes off as strange.  Should have been a half hour TV show instead of a full length movie).
The intro by Chris Lemmon is charming.  Why didn't he have a movie career?  Chris's talent is so ""
""Good Neighbor Sam"" is very dated too......
The price was $10.00 for the whole collection,  but there's at least 3 of the movies that I'll never watch again.",1428105600,,651,4.286885245901639
