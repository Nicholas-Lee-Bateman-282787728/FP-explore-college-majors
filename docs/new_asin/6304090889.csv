7861308,5,6304090889,"One of our favorite classic Peanuts Special tapes at our house, and as of this writing it is still not available on DVD. This 45 minute show is a fast playing series of funny sketches, great for for kids with a short attention span. Lucy is after Schroeder, then turns Linus's blanket into a kit and loses it in the sky. Charlie Brown gets a weird rash on his head, it makes his head look like a baseball. Peppermint Patty is up to her tricks. Snoopy has some exciting things happening at his dog house. I recommend this hilarious video.",1261526400,3,537,4.38
7861309,5,6304090889,"This is another thoroughly enjoyable collection of Peanuts vignettes (along the lines of the equally good ""Charlie Brown Celebration""). Two of the best storylines involve Charlie Brown on the run:
First, he runs to camp, away from the urban stresses that have given his head a baseball-like appearance (via some sort of psychosomatic rash). The scenes at camp are hilarious: His face covered with a paper bag, he earns newfound respect from other campers who regard him as the enigmatic and sagacious ""Mr. Sack.""
Second, Charlie Brown is on the run from a plants' rights organization after he bites the kite eating tree. The box-inhabiting fugitive tries to begin a new life as the coach of a tiny tykes baseball team.  His little players are cute toddlers, but barely ball players.
I hadn't seen this Peanuts special before I bought it for our young kids. It makes all of us laugh, and the voice characterizations of the young supporting characters are particularly charming. ""Adventure"" is a worthy addition to a Peanuts video library.",973209600,21,1037,4.994219653179191
