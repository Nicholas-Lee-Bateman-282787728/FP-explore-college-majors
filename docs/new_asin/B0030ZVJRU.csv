8386422,5,B0030ZVJRU,"This video has sections on Bird Identification, Care, Safety, Housing, Diet.  It's comprehensive enough that even people very familiar with pet birds will learn something new!  Did you know that the backing on mirrors is a common source of lead?  We now require that all staff members watch this at our avian veterinary practice and we have it on a loop in our lobby.  People have really liked it and everyone is learning something from it.  Looking forward to more from Dr. Echols in the future.

It would be great to see it part of new bird owner packages, whether babies in stores or adoptions from shelters and rescues.

My critiques are minor ones - the bird on the cover seems a little fluffed and many people have commented on it not looking super healthy.
The DVD is also heavy on introductions, however, it's super important to know where people are getting the information they are sharing.  Just wish that it took less time to do it.",1290988800,,944,4.610778443113772
8386423,5,B0030ZVJRU,I enjoyed the review of all parrot names - I found this very interesting.  Also general information on how and what you need to keep your parrot happy.  Found this very informative and I learned some new items I should be doing to keep my feathered friends happy.,1266710400,,263,4.458333333333333
