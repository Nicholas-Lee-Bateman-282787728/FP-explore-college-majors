I thought the story was good, the acting was good especialy the man who played santa clause. all in all this is a good movie for the family to enjoy. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1451865600,,248,3.8823529411764706
8729967,3,B0147F0S78,"If you purchased Santa's Summer House (released in 2013), then you don't need to purchase this movie. They're one in the same, just different names. I can only assume that the studio didn't make enough on the first release and are hoping to recover more funds under a different title, different year.

The movie is ok: some decent laughs, predictable problems, quick solutions. I can't say it will be an every Christmas viewing but I'll have it on the shelf just in case.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Action-Star-Christmas/dp/B0147F0S78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Action Star Christmas</a>",1447977600,3,629,6.1477272727272725
