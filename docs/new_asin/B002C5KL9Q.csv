It has an entirely different feel than your standard surf vid, and makes you long for road trips down the beach looking for uncrowded surf.  If you're looking for the newest footage of the big name pros, I'd look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a movie with a feel good vibe, lots of unknown rippers, and a laid back soundtrack that gets you stoked to paddle out, I highly recommend it.  Oh yeah, and the overhead camera shots are amazing.",1246492800,,488,4.388888888888889
