8472541,4,B000P0IZX4,"This is a fascinating flim.  I use it to teach History of Christianity to college students.  The film is a documentary that illustrates the annual Morisma Festival held for centuries in Zacatecas.  This festival reenacts the Spanish battles between Christians and Moors in the late Middle Ages.  Over the centuries it has become a major religious and community event in the lives of locals.  The film is intimate, taking the viewer into the homes and streets to let participants explain in their own words the various elements of the festival.  There are English subtitiles, but the translation is often very incomplete and the grammar and spelling inaccurate, so that many viewers may have a hard time grasping the meaning.  There is no commentary, no effort to provide historical context or to interpret the festival.  As a result, viewers will need to dig on their own to find other resources if they want to understand Morisma historically.  As a well-produced glimpse into a world that few people will otherwise have any chance to enter, it is outstanding.  It is probably most useful for people interested in Mexican cultures, anthropology, and religious studies.",1266624000,,1169,5.0732984293193715
