6649063,5,B00NGAJJAS,These shows are great. I was very happy with my purchase.,1490832000,,57,4.2727272727272725
6649064,5,B00NGAJJAS,I'm half way thru the series and absolutely love it!!!  I liked the show a lot but in the 80's I didn't watch much TV so I missed most of the episodes.  It's absolutely fantastic and the chemistry between Cagney and Lacey just works!  It was money well spent.  I would recommend it to anyone who liked the show back then and it especially speaks to women.,1490400000,5,355,4.253731343283582
6649065,5,B00NGAJJAS,"This collection is exquisite! I have just finished watching all of the discs and I loved it!
The collection arrived in perfect condition and I have thoroughly enjoyed Cagney And Lacey the Complete series.
It is really like two shows in one. The personal interplay between Cagney and Lacey and their family and the detective stories that are riveting.
I cannot say enough good things about this set.
Tyne Daly and Sharon Bless are extraordinary
The writing is superb. If you love and crave great TV drama , you owe it to yourself to buy this terrific set immediately.",1489449600,8,566,4.7272727272727275

6649069,5,B00NGAJJAS,"This collection does ship in multi-dvd holders that stack -more or less- inside the box. I personally would rather prefer paper sleeves because some of the dvds had slipped off during shipping and fell out when I opened it. However, nothing was scratched and as far as I can see no dvd is doubled/missing. The quality is not bad at all. It equals the quality when the show was on tv in 'the olden days'. The sound is a bit unpredictable but in no way distracting. Just that some dvd's play louder than others. The season with meg foster is not included which is fine with me. For me it's always sharon gless anyway in the part and I could not stand seeing someone else in it;) If you loved cagney & lacey you will totally enjoy this collection. I am having a marathon right now.",1486598400,10,778,4.335616438356165

6649071,5,B00NGAJJAS,"This was an excellent series and this is an excellent price, but TVShowsOnDVD has reported that the release announcement was a mistake and that pre-orders here will be cancelled. I will be quite displeased if this happens. I think that if a company  (not referring to Amazon here) announces a product, they should stand behind that announcement and make it right.",1410825600,27,363,4.950819672131147

6649073,5,B00NGAJJAS,Great show!,1502841600,,11,5.0
6649074,5,B00NGAJJAS,Just what it says.  I did not want the pilot or the half dozen or so trial shows with the original actress.  This is the main show with the Bill Conti theme and the one that won all of the Emmy awards.  Great show and a real bargain considering you get almost 6 years of shows.  Only problem is that the discs are all in one case and a little crowded.  Must be careful if you want to view in order.,1501891200,2,398,3.8641975308641974
6649075,5,B00NGAJJAS,I loved the show when it first aired. I love it still.,1501718400,,54,3.5833333333333335

6649082,4,B00NGAJJAS,"Received my copy today. And like other reviewers have mentioned, this is season 2 through 7. The show is the show. You probably know what it's all about. My big problem is with the packaging. Even when DVD's are stacked on top of one another in season sets like Sony Pictures releases (""Sanford and Son"", ""Bewitched"", etc) or in paper sleeves from Mill Creek (""NewsRadio"", ""Wings"") I don't mind. But this is a nightmare. 20 discs and they are on 12 hubs. Plus they are not marked by season, but by titles like ""The True Beginning"" (which isn't the TRUE beginning), or ""Success At Last). But I really shouldn't quibble about this when I got 6 seasons for less than $17.",1499385600,,668,4.528925619834711

Pilot
You Call This Plain Clothes?
Pop Used to Work Chinatown
Beyond the Golden Door
Street Scene
Suffer the Children, and
Better Than Equal .
I went to IMBD to check on this, clicked on get disc at Amazon under these shows, and Amazon led me to the first season of Cagney and Lacey.
I knew there would be duplicates of some of the other shows, but believed that the missing six shows, along with the pilot, would be on the first season. They are not. I wasted 9.95 to find this out, hope this helps others trying to find out the same info.",1497744000,15,614,4.301724137931035

6649087,5,B00NGAJJAS,"During the years this series was on television, my job precluded my watching it. Now, years after the last episode, I'm so enjoying episodes that are extremely well-cast and are not hesitant to take on sensitive topics. Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly shine in this series, but most of the supporting cast fleshes out the show and gives it a vibrant relevance to our world then and now. Set in Queens, New York, there was a lot of city life as well as the underbelly of a big city. The Complete Series Collection makes sure you have every episode at your fingertips to enjoy!",1496188800,2,570,4.490384615384615

8677914,3,B00NGAJJAS,"A fun series, but a little dated!  Desperately striving to be on the right side of all the ""current"" issues of the day ( kinda' takes away the fun from just a little entertainment when they have to ""turn"" you into what they think you ""should"" be.

The label ""The Complete Series"" is misleading as this set does NOT include the pilot movie nor the six episodes from the spring of 1982 when Meg Foster played Christine Cagney before Sharon Gless joined the series.  What I got is great, just not ""Complete"".",1504051200,6,305,4.62962962962963
