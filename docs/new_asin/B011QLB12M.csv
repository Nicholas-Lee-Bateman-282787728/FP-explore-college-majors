7340929,3,B011QLB12M,"The story centers around Jude (Asa Butterfield) a teen boy growing up in Lintonburg, Vermont. He hangs out with his best friend Teddy (Avan Jogia) who is also adopted. His dad Les (Ethan Hawke) is with a different family in NYC. In an odd plot point Eliza (Hailee Steinfeld) stops in Vermont, meets the guys and this suddenly becomes a pregnant teen film (not funny like Juno) with an absentee father and a bunch of people, all well meaning, pulling in different directions.

This is an indy style film with the pseudo-deep soundtrack with beginning and ending platitudes. ""Life is like a river and we are all minnows...""  The time frame in the 1980s and uses the Tompkins Square Park Riots in New York's East Village as a background.

7340931,4,B011QLB12M," In the interest of not spoiling the plot, very few details are given below 

At first 10,000 Saints appears like it might just be a story of two 1980s youths yearning to leave Vermont to live in NYC; however, as life is not known for being predictable, neither is the film.
In the first hour you'll hear Youth of Today, Social Distortion, and other sounds of counterculture from that decade. If you didn't hang out around or live in the LES (particularly Alphabet City) in the 80s or 90s, then 10,000 Saints is a crash course in obscure and/or mostly forgotten fragments of history relevant to that time and place, e.g., squats, ""Krishna-core,"" and the 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot.

Unrest in the park was hardly part of the story, only serving to provide a backdrop and a small bit of context. At least they got a few of the details correct, such as police covering their badge numbers prior to engaging with protestors. What is this tale really about, then?
Here's a mishmash of terms that perhaps best describe 10,000 Saints:
 parenthood  love triangle  hardcore  teen pregnancy  drugs  straight-edge  devilock  secrets  generational divide  CBGB  adoption  personal growth.
Despite how menacing some of those may sound, the film has a lot of heart, and it's not a downer.

The acting is excellent overall, with few missteps. Great to see Julianne Nicholson (although she doesn't get much screen time) and Emily Mortimer as two mothers, very different (on the surface, anyway) yet surely connected. There are numerous scenes having a sharply humorous edge to them without coming across as forced. I wasn't expecting to laugh much during this one, but was pleasantly surprised.
Although you wouldn't expect CGI in a film like this, lots of video manipulation is implemented to create a 1980s NYC.

Final thoughts: Nostalgia was the main reason I enjoyed 10,000 Saints. If you were neither a punk in the 80s nor familiar with the LES during that time, you may still appreciate performances by some high caliber actors and a character-driven plot (just don't expect much action).",1440115200,4,2083,4.902857142857143
7340932,4,B011QLB12M,"I was impressed by Avan Jojia's performance. The character, Teddy is physically on the screen a relatively short time given he is the crux of the story. The power of Jojia's acting leaves a lasting impression that is critical to the relationships and storylines. Really liked the movie. Also, great job by Hailey Seinfeld and Asa Butterfied. Ethan Hawk, great as ever.",1440028800,4,368,4.951612903225806
7340933,5,B011QLB12M,"Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld deliver again and again, and this movie is one I will watch over and over. I'm really loving the plot and the indie feel to the flick. Want to see more from them.",1486512000,,199,4.2631578947368425

7340935,3,B011QLB12M,"The CD 10,000. saints. Arrived on the date scheduled. The movie was basically about teenagers misusing alcohol and drugs.  Which brings about an unwanted pregnancie.  And the dilemmas that are brought about in that kind of situation, and the adult decisions that are put upon the  young teens.  The movie was well acted, and fairly interesting.  But to be honest this was not my kind of movie.  If it wasn't for the superior acting of the cast, I would not have enjoyed this movie at all.",1470614400,2,488,4.616279069767442
7340936,4,B011QLB12M,"The basic synopsis of this film is that we get to follow the lives of three mal adjusted kids and their equally messed up parents from Vermont to New York and back again,  sort of. This is one of those films where if you actually say any more you will ruin some of the plot; so I must demur  despite itching to say more.

The main character is Jude played by Asa Butterfield who is really very good and Ethan Hawke plays his narcotic loving father. I have to say the more I see Ethan Hawke act the better he seems to get. We also have the wonderful Emile Hirsch playing the lead singer to a hardcore punk type band. It is set in the eighties and they do manage to get a lot of details spot on  even CBGBs makes an appearance.

The story is original, the direction great and the actors all seem to live their roles. It is billed as a comedy but I did not see a lot to laugh at here, I did really enjoy it though so as a drama withy light hearted moments it really did work for me.",1466467200,,979,3.9744897959183674

7340939,5,B011QLB12M,"I was a native of New York State, and a college student in New York City.  I studied with some residents from the East Village and visited that area.  Ethan Hawke is an esteemed actor in his own right, but to stage the realities of that time and place was possible with the addition of Asa Butterfield, Emile Hirsch, Julianne Nicholson and Hailee Steinfeld.  LIfe in New York City is very chaotic with a cacophony of living standards.  Incidents that are portrayed in this movie are common in that city.  With the talent of Asa Butterfield and Emile Hirsch  the rage, and riot are very real.  This movie is worth your viewing time to have exposure to city life and the young who have to cope - and prevail.  Although it would seem an actor like Asa
Butterfield - among others - has portrayed better roles in other movies, nevertheless, it required actors of his caliber to have 10,000 Saints a success.  I think captions in English would have enabled a view to follow the movie with more precision.",1456876800,3,998,4.5307262569832405

7340944,3,B011QLB12M,"I started reading this book right after I finished an beautifully-written novel, so it was a clunky beginning for me. But the reason I picked it up was because it was about a music scene that I myself was part of, so I was curious to see how the author handled the subject matter.

While it discusses a lot of issues that the era/scene was dealing with, the novel always seemed saddled with a sense that the author was never actually THERE - that maybe she only talked to people who were there and then wrote about it without having any first-hand knowledge of the scene - in particular, the strong feelings that being in those situations and being that age brought about. Trust me - this was a new, thrilling scene but I never got the true sense of that from any of the characters, other than a cardboard description that it was indeed exciting and a bit dangerous. Everything seemed glossed over and I was disappointed that the author never truly took us inside any of the characters heads and I never felt that I truly understood the motivations of any of the characters.",1449100800,,1074,4.479591836734694

7340946,3,B011QLB12M,"I did not go into watching this movie with a number of unreasonable expectations. It had my attention and my interest but I thought the overall story line was a bit weak. Some generally good performances but nothing all that awesome... remember, I had no expectancy so the fact I was not awestruck should not reflect badly on the film.  The film itself had a gritty quality to it which fit well for the time period and  the New York street setting. Life is not always fair. Things are not always where everyone lives happily ever after.  Approach it with all of that in mind and you will enjoy something you probably heard little about.",1445904000,,636,4.51304347826087
7340947,5,B011QLB12M,"Yet another outstanding performance from Asa Butterfield. Why a film of such quality was not released for general film theaters is beyond me. Perhaps it was not low brow comic book character mega hits the theater management is more interested in. A sad comment on our time.

7340948,5,B011QLB12M,"A gritty, sometimes trashy look at life on the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in the 1980s. When characters try to better their lives, it's almost as if they are constantly being pulled back down into the dregs by the wrong people they know. Depressing, yes, but that unfortunately goes with the territory in this excellent film.",1442534400,2,325,4.719298245614035
7340949,2,B011QLB12M,"Bookended by cap phrases that attempt to be crucial ""meanings of life"" that we should all deeply ponder, this film fails in so many areas. At it's best Ethan Hawke delivers some true moment performances of a father torn by the dead beat choices he's made as he attempts to be a role model in flickering instances while never really emerging as anything worth calling a father in the valuable sense of the word. Essentially, this film is about parents who never grew up themselves and took any real responsibility for their lives, and the tragedy that their own patterns are repeating in their children. Pulling on the hardcore music scene of NYC to lure you into a $7 rental, they never really fully develop that plot line other than to introduce an overweight Emile Hirsche. And yet, whereas it's not some over-romanticized boy meets girl Hollywood rendition, it does force us to believe that in ten years these kids somehow evolved into decently well to do middle class parents enjoying a day at the park with the happily-ever-after fairy tale that Jude stayed with Eliza and the figured it all out. Despite the fact that neither had any education or support system to speak of. I have a hard time believing they did anything other than repeat the cycles of their drug-addicted, self-deluded, self-absorbed parents. My hope would be that they could break those cycles as we all hope we can, but it's choked so far down my throat by the end of the movie that mostly I want to vomit at the prospect of it truly becoming their reality. The best moment in the movie is Ethan Hawke's teary eyes as he watches Jude hold Eliza's baby for the first and only time...realizing (I'm assuming) his own failure as an adoptive father and continued failure as a father that has anything to truly offer his son other than a bunk bed in a crappy apartment where he deals from and a better bag of weed than his son's midtown Vermont dealer. All in all....it's my fault for paying $7 to amazon who has obviously cornered a market and charge highway robbery prices to rent a movie. I miss Blockbuster days.",1442016000,,2088,4.615591397849462
7340950,5,B011QLB12M,"Very realist movie, not one of those typical boy meets girl and that fall in love clichs. Hailee Stienfeld is wonderful in this movie and so is Asa Butterfield. It may seem like a depressing movie, but it is very heartfelt and has it's funny moments. It's worth watching, but not really worth $6.99.",1441411200,2,299,4.555555555555555

8724936,4,B011QLB12M,"As a great fan of ""Ender's Game"" movie and Asa Butterfield as an actor, I decided to order a few Asa Butterfield movies and this was one of them.  I remember seeing the previews for this movie in the past, and saw some interviews with the cast on YouTube.  All in all, I thought that the movie had a good flow of plot and drama, and told a good story.  If the strange ""forelock"" hanging down in front of the main character's face was intended to be distracting and convey the annoyance of a character persona who sought to embody rebellion and rubbing against the grain, then it certainly succeeded in that respect.  I was so relieved when about half-way through the movie he at last cut off that ridiculous forelock in the wake of his coming to greater maturity and sort of ""conversion"" in his life.  I liked the emphasis on the importance of each and every human life; and how we can all work together to achieve greater perfection and joy in the human community.",1531872000,,965,4.429378531073446

8724939,3,B011QLB12M,"Eighteen year old woman gets pregnant;  the parent-figures carry on as if they lived in Victorian times.  Eliza wanting to have her child, rather than an abortion,  should not have seemed to be  the end of the world.

However, Eliza's mother is a control-freak determined to force her to abort the child, despite the fact that the child's father, Teddy, had recently died a tragic death.  His best friend, Jude; his half-brother, Johnny,  and his best friend's father, Les,  unite to offer Eliza some support.

Johnny belongs to a group that says some of  the right things, but his plans to assist Eliza fall through.  Eliza feels abandoned and rejected; adding to the stress and torment she is already suffering.

Despite being ""liberal;""  at the core, Eliza's mother is actually socially conservative.  Forcing Eliza to abort her child is a way to make it seem as though the pregnancy never happened:  to save her  non-family's non-reputation?

No one would ostracize Eliza or any of her family members  if she had the child;  they live in NYC,  who would even know?

Money is not even a consideration:  Eliza could  collect child support and other benefits;  her mother is wealthy from her ballet career;

The most sensible response would have been for the young woman to level with her mother,  to have the child, to continue living with her mother, and eventually go back to school.

In the end, she has the child, but puts him up for adoption.

The film suggests that the  adoption is a good solution; but  unnecessarily giving away the child only  echoes the sadness of these teens, who have been so neglected by their own parents.  In the beginning of the story, Jude  mentions that  he  had only seen his father a few times within the past 7 years. When Jude finally holds the newborn baby, he  asks his father  if he will ever see this person again.  When Eliza and Jude become close, she wonders what he will think of her years later, when most likely they will have long-since drifted apart.  They perceive close relationships as only very fleeting.  So too their attachment to the baby was only fleeting.",1515888000,,2117,4.708791208791209
