8671476,3,B00MBNZFZY,"A so-so tale paying homage to the days when Hollywood was revered as wonderful and glamorous, instead of noted as a cesspool of corruption, propaganda, egotism, and fools.
The cover shot comes into play about halfway through the movie, when the wumpai appear for about 20 seconds as one of many groups dancing to a horrible song - which we are told ""is hot"".
It seems back then you could get a hospital room in minutes by telling the staff you were ""really sick"".
The plot of an aspiring actress (with a manager-paramour who cares more about the PR game than the girl) ultimately lacks believability.

PLOT SPOILER: (Those uninterested, please do not read)
Especially when the more of the tale seems to be ""Why marry someone with money, who cares about you, when you can marry a self-centered liar?""",1441152000,,799,4.707142857142857
