777775,3,6304004664,"I think this dvd is very expensive for Region 2 for a start.
It seems overlong and very slow moving compared to todays films.
It reeks in part of Puccini, with the girl being left as the man returns to the States after a torrid relationship. The man must be as thick as a plank, because he fails to recognise a woman with whom he had a passionate time with a few years earlier. That is so hard to believe, but if you liked Dallas/Dynasty, then you'll like this. More of a chick flick which could have been a real weepie if it wasn't so unbelievable",1334448000,,548,4.179245283018868
777776,3,6304004664,"Despite the great performance of Omar Sharif and Jane Seymour, nothing compare to ""The other side of midnight"", including direction and sound track.",1305676800,3,148,5.478260869565218

777778,1,6304004664,"This movie was terribly dissapointing.  The Other Side of Midnight is one of my all time favorites and I could not wait to see this movie.  The characters and story line are weak and unsophisticated compared to OSOM.  I loved Jane's business attire, she dressed to the T in this movie and the scenery in Greece and Venice were lovely and that's about it.  I would not watch this mini series again.  Jane Seymore was wonderful in ""Somewhere in Time"".",1077840000,4,449,4.5625
777779,4,6304004664,"Jane Seymour and Omar Sharif make this sequel to ""The Other Side of Midnight"" come alive, but they can only hold it together for a limited time.  Seymour plays the amnesiac victim and Sharif is the badguy.  When the are together this crackels, but unfortunately that isn't often.  This film would have been much better with some judicious editing.
P.S.  There is a very sexy scene at the end that unfortunately is covered by the end credits.  Didn't the producers feel that they could have spared an extra five minutes for something interesting?",991872000,5,545,4.817204301075269

7861215,2,6304004664,"I can't rate this movie being that the DVD is for Region 2 viewing only.  I had to return the movie and get a refund.  I'm pretty sure I would've enjoyed the movie had the movie been sellable in the USA region.  Oh well, I'll just read the book.",1377561600,,245,3.9591836734693877
7861216,4,6304004664,"This project is Region 2 which means it wouldn't play on my machine.  In other words I didn't get a chance to watch it.  However, I have seen it before and know the story.",1373328000,,171,4.0
