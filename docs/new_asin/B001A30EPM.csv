3445159,5,B001A30EPM,"Scooby-Doo And The Goblin King is a terrific little animated film. It's filled with all kinds of monsters, and it's a great film watch during Halloween time.

In the movie, Scooby and Shaggy must go to the spirit world on Halloween night in order to stop an evil sorcerer from turning everyone in the real world into monsters. When Scooby and Shaggy are in the spirit world, there's lots of funny scenes as they encounter a werewolf, undead creatures, 3 witches, a talking pumpkin, the headless horseman, fairies, and a Goblin King.

The movie is well written, cute, and it has good voice acting. It has some exciting action scenes, and it's also hysterically funny. I totally recommend this fun little movie.",1477008000,,709,4.80327868852459

3445171,3,B001A30EPM,"Released in 2008, SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE GOBLIN KING is twelfth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home marketand in this instance specifically in time for that years Halloween sales.  The story finds the gang at a Halloween carnival, where they run afoul of a magician named The Amazing Krudsky.  Shaggy and Scooby humiliate Krudsky during his act, but the magician later captures a fairy princess and obtains her powers.  Can world domination be far behind?

There are several SCOOBY-DOO! movies in which the supernatural creatures are realI think ALIEN INVADERS is the bestbut I think the stories work best when they are grounded in what you might call cartoon reality.  This is a fairytale, not a mystery.  Shaggy and Scooby behave out of character when they are deliberately nasty when they wreck Krudskys magic act, and overall the piece lacks the humor and spirit of the best titles in the series.

The Scooby-Doo cartoons aren't great art, but when they are at their best they are a lot of fun.  Its always entertaining to revisit the gang.  But while GOBLIN KING is mildly entertaining, it isn't a visit I care to revisit.

People always complain about the re-boots never meeting their expectations and how the classics are better but I'm just glad Scooby Doo gets the opportunity to resurface throughout the years and not fade away into history. I'm in college now but I still love Scooby Doo and am finally getting to own all of the series and movies :)",1454544000,,450,4.6375

Yes it is creepy at times and may not be suitable for little children but the underline message of what true courage is makes up for it. Tim Curry does a fantastic job as thf voice of the goblin king. This film combines wonderful animation, solid voice acting and a unique story.

3445192,5,B001A30EPM,"My son is really into Scooby Doo. I got him this movie to add to his collection. Scooby and the gang are at a theme park for Halloween and a magician steals the fairy princess and her magic. He just needs the Goblin King's scepter to complete his full power. Scooby and Shaggy go on a wild Halloween adventure to the Goblin's castle to try to rescue the fairy and stop the magician. It's a great and fun adventure. The movie is really based around Shaggy and Scooby more than the rest of the gang but that's OK. The rest of the gang is still involved in some way or another. My son is 4 and I'm honestly surprised he was OK with some of the elements because he isn't a huge fan of Halloween but he did great and asks to watch it again and again. Overall, if the child is a Scooby fan, I would recommend adding it to the collection.",1418774400,,831,4.104294478527607

3445203,1,B001A30EPM,"I actually bought Scooby-Doo and the Goblin King based on all of the good reviews listed. I don't know what movie everyone was watching but it was awful. The plot feels like it was written for another animated series and makes no sense. Plus now we have real monsters, real ghosts--and fairies!? Not funny or entertaining and even if they were to use a supernatural gimmick they did not capture the feel of a Scooby Doo story. I have a high tolerance for some of the poorer episodes and cheap made for TV and DVD movies and this was just bad. Really bad!

I really enjoyed this movie because it doubles as a good Halloween flick. Scooby Doo and Shaggy are tasked with saving Fred, Velma, and Daphne from an evil magician. Of course, things go astray for the fearful duo and they have many adventures in the ""spirit world"" as they seek the Goblin King. I loved this movie!",1379203200,,473,4.925

The two least likely to show bravery and currage do so in this movie, they overcome many obsticles along the way. I used this movie as a learning experience for my son, as he has faced many obsticles in his young life, that he too has overcome.

The plot was a tad jumpy, it did have some good humor. I didn't really care for this one too much because throughout the movie I became bored. It seemed to drag in some parts and others it seemed like you were waiting for something to happen that just never did. On the other hand my 3 year old loved it. It didn't scare her, she was amused throughout the movie, and in three days wanted to go for her third viewing today.

To be honest I tend to watch some of the episodes with them and I think the kids like scooby and the gang because their funny and innocent and down to earth. I prefer these types of cartoons compared to the new ones-which on TV are completely inappropriate for smaller kids. I think it makes my kids use their imagination more; each one allows them to play a part; They try to solve the mysteries as they watch. Scooby-Doo and the Goblin King was alright to them I know they seen a bunch but it's worth trying.

3445230,2,B001A30EPM,"We have a bit of a Scooby-Doo fixation in my house; my daughter (6) and son (nearly 3) both adore the new movies, and we've streamed them as they've been available on Netflix.  Now that Netflix is getting stingy with our queue, I'm looking to add some of these newer moview to our collection.

This one, however, I won't buy.  While the humor is smart, and like the classic shows, covers range from the zany/silly to the smart/sly, the ending of this one was simply unacceptable.  One of the reasons my husband and I both love Scooby for the kids is its emphasis on skepticality (hooray for Velma!).  This movie went to completely different territory, treating the supernatural as if it were actually there.  In other words, it simply wasn't a Scooby-Doo storyline.  There was no rational explanation and guy in a mask muttering about ""those darned kids and their dog"" at the end.  I'll pass, thanks; if I want my kids' heads filled with nonsense, there are plenty of other choices out there.",1296172800,,992,4.660919540229885

3445233,4,B001A30EPM,"Yes, another Scooby-Doo movie. This one was made especially for Halloween and it is quite charming. Shaggy (Casey Kasem) & Scooby-Doo (Frank Welker) are the main characters in this one with Fred (Frank Welker), Velma (Mindy Cohn) & Daphne (Grey DeLisle) as secondary characters. Luckily, Scrappy has still not made an appearance so we didn't have to deal with just the 3 of them (my least favorite Scooby-Doo episodes). Shaggy & Scooby must save the world by confronting monsters of all shapes and sizes -- everything that scares them the most! I think that the movie was going for a positive affirmation that, even though you are scared, you can still accomplish anything you set your mind to do. What the movie never brought up was the fact that Shaggy & Scooby brought a lot of their own problems upon themselves by making fun of the magician at the Carnival. Then Fred, Daphne & Velma complicated matters by trying to set a trap for the wrong guy at the end of the movie. I am not sure that a Scooby-Doo movie is the right venue to encourage children to take responsibility for their own actions, but it would have been nice if it had been addressed in some fashion.

I did not care for Fred's voice (Frank Welker) or Scooby's voice (Frank Welker), but I did enjoy the voice talents of the other characters. Jay Leno plays a funny Jack-o-Lantern, Hayden Panettiere plays the voice of the fairy princess Willow, Tim Curry plays the Goblin King, James Belushi, Wayne Knight, Wallace Shawn, Larry Joe Campell & Lauren Bacall made great cameos in the movie and it was fun to hear their voices coming out of unexpected characters mouths. The animation is firmly 2-dimensional with no real shading or subtle color gradations, but everything is bright and colorful (despite being in a relatively dark Halloween-land setting) with good movement during the action scenes. There are some original songs written for this movie that are not fabulous, but they are not bad either. Most of the songs are kind of talked/sung by people who are not singers, but this does not diminish the enjoyment or the impact on the film.

Nonetheless, I did enjoy this movie quite a bit. All of the classic Halloween monsters are in the film: werewolves, vampires, ghosts, skeletons, goblins, fairies, the Headless Horseman, talking rabbits, witches, warlocks, flying broomsticks, evil wizards and more. This movie had the knack of making these monsters seem like the scary monsters that they are, but not scary for the viewers.

It's certainly not as ""scary"" as some ""Where are you?"" series shows, I think.  It's just a cute Halloween story - only ""Newman's"" voice (Wayne Knight) makes it a teeny bit scary to me!!

3445237,5,B001A30EPM,"Out of the bunch of Scooby Doo movies that have come out on DVD in the last decade, this is easily my favorite (although, I can't lie, they all have their merits...)  This has one of the most complex Scooby Doo plots of all time... and features real ghosts and spooks, as opposed to the usual ""Old Mr. Jenkins in a mask"" type scenarios.

Casey Casem is on board as shaggy, always a nice treat, as he does a percentage of Scooby Doo's these days, but not all. Theres other great voice work here as well, like Wayne Knight and Jay Leno in strong supporting roles.

Now lets run it down. This one is jam packed with a slew of Halloween treats. The ghost train comes in early to transport Scoob and Shaggy to the land of Halloween. The Ghost train scene is very well done... shortly after we arrive at the Ghost Saloon, and meet The Headless Horseman. Eventually the plot comes to a hilt, when the fairies, goblins, and other monsters all meet up in the real world (as is predicted by a crystal ball early on...) The whole gang are changed to monsters. Daphne a witch, Freddie a Vampire, and Thelma (hee hee) a Werewolf. A strong climatic ending makes sure that you will enjoy this edition of the series over and over, and as for a Halloween pick, this is a definate. Whether you have kids, are a kid, or just eat too many Scooby Snacks... you will dig.",1256428800,,1349,4.324110671936759
3445238,5,B001A30EPM,"Even though I am 21 years old,I still enjoy watching Scooby Doo. It's not something that you ever grow out of.

Now this movie is really good. However it's best to watch it around Halloween. It does kind of put you in the Halloween spirit and it's something to watch when you are giving out Halloween Candy to trick or treaters. Last year I watched this movie on Halloween night while giving out candy and I really enjoyed it.

The main plot of the movie is good and the voice talents like always, are awesome. It mostly features Shaggy and Scooby but the rest of the gang is in the movie.

If you are looking for a great movie to watch for Halloween that's not too scary or messy, than this is the one for you. It's great for all ages. I mean I have a 9 year old cousin who loves the movie, I'm 21 and I think this is a great movie and I have an Aunt in her 60's who doesn't have kids, but bought this movie anyway for herself because she likes it. So yeah, this is a movie for all ages and one that most will really enjoy.",1255219200,,1024,4.0344827586206895
3445239,3,B001A30EPM,"I had mixed feelings on this one, for sure.  It really is a bummer to take what was unique about Scooby Doo, in that past Scooby Doo episodes and movies were actually ""investigating"" mysteries, (including unmasking plots to scare people with fake supernatural items for nefarious purposes), and have this deviate from the formula so much.

This seems derivative of much other pop culture items, but not in a fun way.  The goblin ball music is totally a take off of ""zoot suit riot""; the headless horseman is uncredited but seems plugged in for no good reason here;  and the Hayden Pannetiere ""tinkerbell"" fairy creature, including magic pixie dust, was just a rip off of the Peter Pan/Tinkerbell craze right now.  And of course, ""The Amazing Krudski"" seems a take-off of ""The Amazing Kreskin"" of the 1970s, which I doubt anyone except magic buffs would get.

Having Wayne Knight, Lauren Bacall (!), Jay Leno, Wallace Shawn, Casey Casem again, Hayden Pannetieri, Tim Curry, and Jim Belushi was great plus-- what great talent there is here! The story was mostly Shaggy and Scooby which is a bummer.  I mean, Scooby and Shaggy in Drag as Velma and Daphne?  Why bother when Velma and Daphne are hardly in this movie at all?

The story didn't really care to follow the plot and became a series of unconnected scenes without really any attention to logic at all, and the end seemed rushed 7) The lack of Velma was deafening.

At the end of the day, it was fun to watch but forgettable after a few days. I should note that my four year old son found that this quickly replaced ""Where's my Mummy"" as his favorite Scooby Doo movie ever.  If he had his way, he would have given this five stars.  ;-)",1252281600,,1689,4.593333333333334

3445242,5,B001A30EPM,"Giving you a brief run down of where I stand, I think (# 1) ""Zombie Island"" was really great. (# 2) ""Witch's Ghost"" was almost as good. (# 3) ""Alien Invasion"" had its moments. I didn't much care for (# 4) ""Cyber Chase."" (# 5) ""Legend of the Vampire,"" was surprisingly good. (# 6) ""Monster of Mexico,"" was weak, but it had its moments. (# 7) ""Loch Ness Monster"" was different, but interesting. (# 8) ""Aloha Scooby Doo"" was pretty good. (# 9) ""Where's My Mummy?"" was especially well written. (# 10) ""Pirates Ahoy"" was really great and remains my 2nd favorite. (# 11) ""Chill Out"" was disappointing and weak.

Of this 12th chapter, my response was ""What a rebound!"" It starts normal enough with Scooby and the gang at this haunted carnival on Halloween. They run into a magician who is less than polite, and we find out that he can barely do the most simple magic tricks. He then runs into a magic fairy and steals her powers. Needless to say, this amateur magician goes from being comically ineffective, to disturbingly powerful.

While trick or treating, Scooby and Shaggy come across this situation, and even though they are often cowardly about embraking on quests, they realize they have to rise above their weaknesses to save their friends, and maybe even the universe as we know it. (That's what makes Scooby and Shaggy so lovable. They have weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but they know that friends matter.)

To make a long story short, they have to go into the spirit world to find a way to save life as we know it. And the interesting thing is that they run into different creatures associated with Halloween. (Ghosts, goblins, witches, jackolanterns, the Headless Horseman, etc.) And to make matters even more interesting, they can not be sure as to who will be a threat, and who may offer some help. (GREAT!)

As if I needed another great thing to say about this movie, the climax is not only full of terror, (as well as some laughs), but there is a chilling twist as the moral ambiguity of the Goblin King (Tim Curry) is unfolded and we know where he stands.

Overall, it's a PHENOMENAL adventure with tributes to different Halloween specials and movies. If you don't get this dvd, don't call yourself a fan of Scooby Doo.",1231977600,,2232,4.626262626262626
3445243,3,B001A30EPM,"Though I adore the original and classic Scooby Doo cartoons from way back then, I have to admit that I love What's New Scooby Doo. These recent movies (Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico, Scooby Doo and the Legend of the Vampire, Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster, Scooby Doo in Where's My Mummy, Scooby in Pirate's AHoy, Chill Out Scooby Doo, etc) are also something that I've really enjoyed watching. However, I gotta say that I was extremelly disappointed with this one. For one, it's another one of those ""the monster's real this time""-kinda movie. Don't get me wrong, Zombie Island, Ghoul School, Boo Brothers, Reluctant Werewolf, Witche's Ghost, and all those others were fantastic, but in order to make these ""the monster isn't a guy in a mask""-kinda Scooby Doo movies, you just gotta be good, because it doesn't always work out. It didn't here.

Like almost all of the other reviews have said, this is a Scooby-Doo/Shaggy movie, barely any scenes with Fred and Daphne, and almost none with Velma. (The way the writers got rid of Velma here was by saying that she passed out because she couldn't believe the monsters were real this time - LAME!). Also, the surprise ending at the end - which I'm not gonna ruin - kinda makes the entire movie a comedy and makes not understand previous scenes that you thought you understood. The songs were...strange. Also, the animation could have been way better and some of the characters were annoying. However, there were some good points, such as the good Scooby humor and...wait, that's all I can think of. The plot was okay but it could have been better if they didn't make the monsters real. And, I know it's a children's movie, but some parts were way too kiddy and weren't the Y7 material we've got used to seeing in What's New Scooby Doo. Ironically, some parts were too scary, like when the way some of the characters turn into monsters. You see the green laser-like light entering their bodies and causing them pain.

BUT, my kids really have enjoyed this DVD. It has gotten them all prepped and excited about Halloween. I feel like their attention to this movie will ebb over time though.

And there are plenty of guest-star voices too including Lauren Bacall, Wayne Knight (Newman on ""Seinfeld"") and Tim Curry.

This cartoon centers mostly on Scooby and Shaggy who get teleported to the ""Spirit World"" where they must get the goblin scepter before an evil magician steals it and turns everyone on earth into Halloween monsters. Fred, Daphne and Velma are at the beginning and end of the movie, so the format is a little different then the regular series which usually centers on the gang and switches back and forth between Scooby and Shaggy, and Fred and the girls, when they get separated.

Another departure from the norm is that the stuff is really happening (i.e. real magic, real fairies and real goblins), unlike the tv show where it was a criminal disguised as an evil monster or supernatural being, so it's similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-And-the-Witch-s-Ghost/dp/B0006IIPH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo!

The movie has some jaunty musical numbers and is boosted by a surprisingly high profile voice cast for a direct-to-DVD movie (even if it is something as popular as Scooby Doo). Jay Leno, Tim Curry, Hayden Panettiere, and Wallace Shawn (AKA Rex from the Toy Story series) all feature as guest characters, with Leno and Shawn putting in particularly fun performances. Some of the monsters may be a little scary for younger children, but if they were able to watch Zombie Island they should be fine with this movie. While it doesn't reach the storytelling heights of Zombie Island, I'd say it's at least on par with Witch's Ghost and Alien Invaders and definitely better than Cyber Chase.

I'm definitely planning to revisit it at that time of year.",1489017600,,1128,4.673366834170854
