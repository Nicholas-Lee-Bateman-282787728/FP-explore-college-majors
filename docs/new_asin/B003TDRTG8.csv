8405053,4,B003TDRTG8,"I guess it makes sense to lump LOVE IS ON THE AIR (1937) and YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FOREVER (1942) together as a package deal. Both are comic crime capers. Both lean heavy on their newsroom elements. Both introduce a plot beat in which an ambitious reporter is taken down a peg and demoted to a less prestigious position. But pardon me if I focus more on LOVE IS ON THE AIR, since I like it better than YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FOREVER.

LOVE IS ON THE AIR is most relevant for its being Ronald Reagan's screen debut. Fresh off his background in sports radio - he was a sportscaster covering Chicago Cubs games - Reagan's transition to cinema probably wasn't as rocky as other folks. He snags the lead role of crusading radio reporter Andy McCaine. McCaine has vowed on air that he would expose the organized racketeering what's been plaguing the city. So tune in to KDTS for his daily ""15 minutes of hot news."" But what are the odds that the radio station's sponsor is in cahoots with the local mob? McCaine is warned off them hot button topics. McCaine scorns the warning. He promptly finds himself exiled to hosting the children's radio show.

I feel a segue coming on. In YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FOREVER, a reporter (Brenda Marshall) faints during an execution and submits a fake story. She gets found out and is relegated to the newspaper's ""Advice to the Lovelorn"" column. However, she and her editor (George Brent) are soon caught up in trying to get the scoop on a notorious racketeer. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FOREVER has its moments, but it's mostly formulaic in how it mines those newsroom hijinks so prevalent in 1930s cinema. Not that LOVE IS ON THE AIR also doesn't apply those same tropes. I just think it's the superior movie. Maybe it comes down to my liking the actors on one movie more so than those on the other.

If you'd seen Ronald Reagan onscreen before, you're no stranger to the easy warmth the man exudes. He's got a natural presence. Love is on the Air is an hour-long treat to classic movie buffs. I liked it when Reagan is inspired to liven up his dull children's programming by taking it on the road. He starts reporting live on-site of kids' sports activities. My eyebrow did arch a bit when one of these events included children without headgear boxing each other in the ring (My, we are soft today, aren't we?). There's that comfy chemistry between Reagan and the impudent June Travis (she plays a fellow radio personality). There's that drinking game you could play where you take a shot each time someone in the movie mentions the address ""530 Lakehurst Road."" And now worries, the film doesn't neglect the baddies. Somewhen during his demotion, Reagan and his frienemy, June Travis, stumble on clues that lead them back to organized racketeering.

By the way, here's another link to Chicago sports. Did you know - you probably did - that June Travis's dad was at one time vice president of the White Sox?",1390089600,2,2912,4.594230769230769
