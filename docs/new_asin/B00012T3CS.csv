8005720,5,B00012T3CS,"Classic images of the Kabuki and ones you will not forget.  DVD commentary is most helpful and has only added to my knowledge of each of these pieces. Beautiful staging, costumes and performed by a great master, Tamasaburo Bando. Another excellent DVD of the Kabuki.",1421539200,2,266,4.911111111111111
8005721,5,B00012T3CS,"I think Tamasaburo Bando will go down in history as one of the greatest Kabuki dancers.  And this ""Lion Dance"" is a well known dance - and performed by a master - what more you ask - the quality of the video is great - actually I wonder if it's not better seeing it on video instead of flying to Tokyo?",1403395200,4,302,3.9508196721311477
