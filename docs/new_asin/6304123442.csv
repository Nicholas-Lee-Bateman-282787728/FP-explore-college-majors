7862150,4,6304123442,"This is a very entertaining movie but with many many flaws. First I'll get all the bad stuff out of the way. The dubbing stinks. The voices are fake and are not in synch with character talking. The animation is complete [garbage]. IF you watch this movie after princess mononoke you feel like your watching something in the 50's. Much of the movie is shot in still screen. They show the same picture continuously and the people still talk. It's only 45 minutes long And it feels like its rushed, they only say the most crucial things to the story line so you can't blink or you need to press the rewind button.
With that out of the way this is a very fun movie. It's very intense for time its running(short). The story is hard to follow but pretty good ( i watched this movie four times and I still don't COMPLETELY get it) The action is excellent. It's got all kinds. Martial arts, Spear, gun, robot and ariel dog fighting.
You'll probably be confused with whos the good guy and whos the bad. (I am).
This is definitely worth the rent. You decide wether you want to buy it.",1018310400,6,1074,4.348258706467662
