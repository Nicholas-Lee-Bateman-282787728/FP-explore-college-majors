8169338,3,B000MI0L3Q,"This video features the eloquent JJ Gormley, who teaches internationally and has a number of yoga studios in Northern Virginia.  This is her fourth video, she also has at least one chanting CD.  The alignment techniques for the seven chakras are demonstrated on her lovely assistant, Sarah Campbell.  Don't expect repetition in this short video, each chakra is explained and then we move on.  The video is informative though a bit dry. and probably not for beginners.",1193356800,,467,5.025974025974026
