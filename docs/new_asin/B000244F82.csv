8021880,3,B000244F82,"The series started on the two Ex-Driver OVA volumes continues with a full-length (if you consider 64 minutes full-length) movie featuring Lorna, Lisa, and Souichi. If you haven't watched the series, in the future, all vehicles are controlled by AI computer systems, but even these systems experience malfunctions. When these glitches occur, the Ex-Drivers, drivers who still know how to manually drive cars, are called in to stop the runaway vehicles. In the movie, an Ex-Driver convention is being held in Los Angeles which culminates in a race of the most skilled drivers from different countries from around the world. Of course, upon first arriving our heroes have to deal with a runaway car. Its passenger is the daughter of the sponsor of the American Ex-Driver team, who used to be a mob boss but reformed and became a pasta magnate. Lorna, Lisa, and Souichi will find themselves becoming more deeply involved in the intrigue and plots to sabotage the race than in the actual competition itself.  This dvd also includes a bonus feature called ""Danger Zone"" in which two supporting characters, Nina and Rei, from the OVAs take centerstage in a story that happened when the current cast were still in diapers.

I really liked the original show, but to me the movie just seemed like more episodes and had very little improvement in the animation like you would expect. The story didn't grab me either. The character interaction that I'm used to was absent. Both the movie and the episode were cliched, and while entertaining, didn't add anything to the overall tale of the main characters. With the two volumes of the OVA, this concept of Ex-Driver was played out. You just can't do much with car chases after a while.",1152489600,2,1722,4.873720136518771
8021881,5,B000244F82,"I got this DVD due to I'm a speed racer fan,

and like to see more car anime,

I was happy to get this one.

the kid reminds me of a young speed racer

as he and 2 girls help the cops to

stop CGI robot cars that gong rouge.

and they compete in car races as well,

the action is good as the CGI cars

mix with the hand drawn anime drivers well

good CGI affects.

as for popular anime voices

 the boy ""souichi"" voices is tie

from digimon,

and one of the men in the movie

voies is rick hunter from robotech.

I was even blown away as

this movie even had a big robot truck

among to the mammoth car from speed racer

as it plows in to the race track smashing the racers.

if your a big fan of the 70's

speed racer,

you'll get a kick out of this DVD.",1146614400,,755,3.735483870967742
