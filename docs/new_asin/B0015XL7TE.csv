8260399,5,B0015XL7TE,"My husband and I stumbled across ""Nimrod Nation"" when it was being aired on Sundance.  My husband is a ""yooper"" so we are quite familiar with the ""U.P."" and watching this show was like going home for us.  It is very family friendly, engaging,  and fun to watch.  Go Nimrods!",1252972800,2,274,4.42
