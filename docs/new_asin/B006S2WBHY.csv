5015154,5,B006S2WBHY,"I have been doing at home workouts and going to the gym for years. All three of these dvd's are challenging, and I am just in love with these so much. You can feel your body changing right away, but I do agree with other reviews that you do need knowledge of working out. She does give you cues on how to position yourself and a modified version to. Can't wait for more DVDs and hope they are seprrate ones to like these! I like the long version that she does for each body zone is so nice to have in comparison to a lot of other workouts that just work an area for twenty minutes. Which is fine but when you have been doing dvd's for awhile it's nice to have a workout that is a little more advanced! And this program just hits the spot for that!",1335916800,,747,4.02013422818792
5015155,2,B006S2WBHY,"I bought this product mostly because it had such positive reviews and I am disappointed. There is no warm up, Leah just immediately jumps into exercises that require a back round in dance training to hold your balance/ body right and a good knowledge of yoga. I have been dancing for 4 years and found her jumping into working out right away dangerous. Her moves are also advanced so if you are advanced you will probably like this alot. A knowledge of yoga is a must for some of these moves.",1335484800,32,492,4.417582417582418
5015156,5,B006S2WBHY,"I usually end up putting workout Dvds in my stack of 100's as ok. I think maybe they will be good to use if I cant get to the gym. I have done Every workout there is. Insanity, P90X, Hip hop abs and have been a personal trainer for 15 years and these DVD's blew me away. I have never been more challenged in my 20 years of fitness and exercise. The ballet title is deceiving. This woman will change your body. I was so impressed with these 3 workouts and wish she would make more!",1334102400,21,480,4.010416666666667
5015157,5,B006S2WBHY,Wow! That's all I can say about these workouts! My body has changed in just 5 work outs. I also bought Leah's other two dvd's. Yes it's challenging but its so worth it. I'm new to ballet body so I had to modify some of the workouts. Music is great. my muscles were shaking but I powered through it. So worth it. You won't be sorry you purchased these!!!,1332720000,6,353,4.130434782608695
5015158,5,B006S2WBHY,"I had never done any of Leah Sarago's workouts before getting the three new Signature Series DVDs.  I had heard such raves about her downloads and these DVDs on the Video Fitness forum, though, that I decided to give them a try.  Although I have done similar workouts in the past, I had been worried before ordering these that the Ballet Body workouts would be too advanced for a Ballet Body newbie like me.  Each DVD is definitely tough, but they are fun and the time seems to fly by.

The workout runs about 45 minutes long, and you just need a mat to do it.  I had been worried that it would be too long and intense for me, but Leah paces it so that just as your core seems to tire from one move, she has you move on to a different one.

This Core workout includes standing core work, along with many variations on side planks and C-curve work. Since my core is my weakest area and I often struggle with lower back problems, this workout was the one I was most worried about being able to do, but I've been able to stick with it by just taking more frequent breaks.  I can tell that this DVD is going to make me much stronger and help with my back issues.

Also, if you struggle with neck issues when doing this DVD, try Googling ""Pilates Enthusiasts Neck Strain and the C-Curve"" for a great video on tips to help with strain/pain.  For the last month, I have also been using Suzanne Bowen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gorgeous-Core-with-Suzanne-Bowen/dp/B0040LGY7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gorgeous Core with Suzanne Bowen</a>&nbsp;DVD, and I think that it helped me build up to doing the Ballet Body one.

One of the only negatives in this and the Lower Body workout is that sometimes I had a hard time seeing the angles and positioning of Leah's body.  (In the Upper Body workout, I didn't have this problem.) Instead of shooting her straight on, the camera sometimes shot from a side view, which made it hard for me to see the exact placement.  I'm hoping that as I do this DVD more, though, I'll be able to make sure that my positioning is correct.

On her website, Leah also has posted various rotations for using the DVDs. (I would include the link here, but usually Amazon won't allow you to include links in reviews; if you look at the product description above, though, you'll see it.)  She suggests you follow each rotation for four weeks, before moving on to the next level.

Here is a basic rundown of some of the rotations:

BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE:
Day 1 Lower Body
Day 2 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 3 Core
Day 4 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 5 Upper Body
Day 6 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 7 Rest day

INTERMEDIATE:
Day 1 Lower Body
Day 2 Core + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 3 Upper Body + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 4 Rest day
Day 5 Lower Body
Day 6 Core + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 7 Upper Body

ADVANCED:
Day 1 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 2 Core + Upper Body
Day 3 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 4 Rest day
Day 5 Core + Upper Body
Day 6 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 7 Core + Upper Body

For cardio, Leah suggests that you do things like dance workouts, cycling, or swimming -- activities that won't ""bulk"" you up.

I'm just starting a six- or eight-week rotation using these, so I'll be sure to update my reviews of each DVD as I continue with this program.  I plan on doing dance cardio (like Zumba and hi/lo aerobics) and kickboxing for the duration of my rotation.

Overall, though, each workout is very unique, and I'll post back on any changes I notice as I progress through my rotation.

UPDATE AFTER THREE WEEKS:  I did the Intermediate rotation using all three DVDs for three weeks (after which time I had to stop working out for a few weeks due to some stitches), and loved the results I was getting!  My abs and arms were noticeably tighter, and I could see more muscle definition.  My legs seemed to lag behind a bit, and I felt like my saddlebags were a little more prominent, but perhaps that is because I needed to add in a bit more cardio. These are great workouts, and I look forward to starting back up with them!  The next time, I will take measurements to track my results better.",1330560000,97,4185,4.422425032594524
5015159,5,B006S2WBHY,"Leah really puts together sequences of moves that deliver. I can personally say that her core/abs workouts have not only flattened my belly, but have greatly alleviated my wonky back. My back pain has subsided quite a bit since I started using Ballet Body as my main and only strength workout. I've been a subscriber since last year, and I don't have anything but praise for Leah.

The initial standing section is quite of a balance challenge and I love it. Then you'll be doing moves on the mat (side planks, c-curve), ending with a short bridge section followed by some stretching. I have to say that after doing this workout twice time absolutely flies! It's over before I know it, and I feel super accomplished because, don't get me wrong, it's hard!",1328054400,4,754,4.669172932330827
5015160,5,B006S2WBHY,"I am a subscriber to Ballet Body downloads since June 2010.  I have all of Ballet Body downloads and the Periodization System.  I love everything Leah Sarago has put out and I have been anxiously waiting for the Ballet Body Signature Series to be released.  The wait was worth it!

Ballet Body Signature Series Core dvd is a unique workout that works your core in forty-five minutes.  Forty-five minutes may seem like a long time to work your core, but Leah has broken the workout down in three segments.  First is standing abs, side planks, and variations of the c-curve.  The standing abs portion of the workout uses balancing moves to engage your core.  The exercises are done gracefully and you feel like a dancer while performing the moves.  Next is a series of side planks to hit the obliques and abs more.  Leah uses a lot of variety to work the abs while on your side.  Last is the c-curve exercises.  Leah quickly moves from one exercise to another.  She doesn't do a whole bunch of reps, but uses a lot of variety to hit different angles of the abs.  Leah completes the core workout with stretches to release any tension that you may have in your upper body, neck, and abs.

Get this dvd...you won't be disappointed!",1327881600,40,1226,4.534246575342466
5015161,5,B006S2WBHY,"I always say that I don't like to specifically work my abs (crunches are dreadful), but this DVD makes working your abs and core enjoyable and fun.  There is a wide variety of moves that challenge your entire core (transverse abs, obliques, back), not just the six-pack muscles.  The DVD begins with standing work to challenge your balance and force your core to stabilize.  There is a short series of side planks, which is just long enough to feel the burn!  The work then moves onto the mat for pilates-inspired variations that target the obliques and transverse abs.  The DVD ends with back extensions and bridge work.

The DVD is very well-balanced.  It targets the major core stabilizing muscles, including the back, which is often overlooked.  As always, Leah's cuing is spot-on, which allows you to feel the work deep in your abs.  I have learned so much from Leah's attention to form and detail.  This DVD contains many unique variations on traditional moves that make it so fresh, exciting, and particularly challenging!",1327881600,20,1029,4.895953757225434
5015162,5,B006S2WBHY,"Imagine being severely overweight, your stomach is out to HERE and drags down to THERE.
And then imagine someone saying ""I can make it all better.""
You laugh.
Nope. Leah can do it!

Leah works ""corset"" muscles properly, teaching you to train your abs in and flat, not out and puffy, and boy, does she hit your core in EVERY angle. Planks, standing and c-curve work. [no crunches here, but sometimes You wish at the end that's all ya did!] and then you turn around and work your upper, mid and lower back and balance [remember the back is core too!}. 45 minutes of slightly cardio-esque work while you work your core, so while you eat properly and do cardio (buhbye abdominal fat!) when it is all gone, you will have flat, strong abs, that most dancers will be envious. These can be supplemented with Leah Sarago's downloads [I've been training with this woman for almost two years now, and I am telling you, she's a wizard]. but the dvds, get the downloads, train your body properly, and look and feel fantastic.",1327795200,111,1012,4.56043956043956
5015163,5,B006S2WBHY,"Leah work is definitely the best out there.  She begins with standing work that required balance and concentration moves into some killer side plank work then moves you into mat work, finishing with work on all fours.  Nothing is neglected in this workout!  It's solid, effective and you'll feel great after you are through.  You'll abs will be pulled in and you'll be standing up straighter.  Nothing on dvd compares to typical ""barre"" classes but this workout certainly does!  Try this and I bet you'll be so thrilled with your results that you'll be begging for more... Thankfully Leah has downloads available.  I've been using them and love them all.  Her dvds are a great mix of what she has for downloads but the downloads offer so much more.  Try it!  You'll love it!",1327708800,6,774,4.708955223880597

5015166,5,B006S2WBHY,Works if you keep at it.  I notice right away....posture better....core stronger and my belly gets...sleeker....can't explain....people ask me what I am doing cause I'm looking good.  So it works but as with everything else you have to do it.,1453593600,,242,5.025
5015167,5,B006S2WBHY,"Amazing. . . well thought out. . . fantastic instruction. I purchased this in hopes of finding some type of routine to help align my back/hips and help with my neck and back pain.  I know it is not intended too or nor does it claim to help with back pain but I have finally found the answer with this.  I purchased the Upper Body and Lower Body workouts.  All are excellent!  My back and neck feel stronger, after having gone through therapy both times with pregnancies I still struggled with pain, but this helps realign my back and hips and the pain is gone!!!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!",1452470400,,598,4.351351351351352
5015168,5,B006S2WBHY,"I'm a workout DVD junkie. Always looking to find the best possible DVDs out there. I stumbled upon this the other day. I have never heard of Leah Sarago before, nor have I ever done ballet. I was trying to find a nice core workout-in which I actually felt my core! So many workout DVDs disappoint when it comes to working the core. Either the exercises are too easy or they barely touch working the core. This DVD works EVERY bit of your core. I am so satisfied with this! It's PURE core. Yes, you may feel other body parts, but the core is the most worked, which really makes me happy! I FINALLY found a solid, well-rounded core workout. I highly recommend this! Thank you, Leah!",1448841600,5,680,4.362204724409449
5015169,4,B006S2WBHY,I don't like the standing work (short though) but enjoy the mat work.  Lots of new challenging  moves here and it's not so hard that I'm afraid to put it in.  I usually pair it with one of my ellen barrett 30 min videos.  Good purchace.,1442016000,3,236,4.065217391304348
5015170,5,B006S2WBHY,May be too tough for me but not like any other workout video I've seen. Leah is simply beauty and grace in action. Her workout is based on balance and strength. The set is beautiful and I prefer her voice over. Obviously she is working very hard to do the artistically beautiful moves that strengthen and tone.  She is advanced but her moves are doable. I hope to get back after a few months with additional comments.,1441756800,2,417,4.415584415584416
5015171,5,B006S2WBHY,"This workout is tough! She really focuses on the core and talks through the precise movements for best results. Some of the moves are a little unusual and feel awkward to do at first, but they are specially geared to target the muscles in the core and get results. I love this as it is challenging and I can feel my abs burning as I do the exercises!",1437955200,,350,4.161764705882353
5015172,4,B006S2WBHY,I really like this video. The moves are doable and not too many reps. The only thing I don't like is that they shot the video with her standing on the diagonal so when she's showing placement for moves it's a little confusing. I prefer to be able to mirror the instructor face on. I am used to it now that I know the moves.,1436745600,,323,3.9846153846153847
5015173,5,B006S2WBHY,Excellent exercise.,1436486400,,19,9.0

5015175,5,B006S2WBHY,"I took ballet when I was a child, and really wish I'd kept with it.  I'm looking forward to working out with this DVD and getting some semblance of a ""Ballet Body"" to get and stay in shape.  This, and the other Ballet Body DVD's look like they can do it for me.",1434585600,,261,3.9056603773584904

5015178,3,B006S2WBHY,A decent workout.  A little boring.,1426982400,2,35,4.833333333333333
5015179,5,B006S2WBHY,"YES, YES AND YES! This video is a full hour and focuses on full-body balance rather than just ab strength. Such a great purchase. I absolutely love this!",1426032000,,153,4.5
5015180,4,B006S2WBHY,"The Ballet Body workouts are more for sculpting, not shedding weight.",1425600000,,69,5.363636363636363
5015181,1,B006S2WBHY,"No warm up, just jumps right in. No basic moves, just high training. Not the Ballet Body workout I expected.",1424649600,,108,4.45
5015182,4,B006S2WBHY,"I started off hating this, but then I realized it was just because I wasn't yet strong enough to even do these workouts without getting totally annoyed, because they require balance. Unlike my other barre workout videos, this one does not use a chair or barre for balance at all, so you're on your own and if your balance/core is not strong enough yet, you will know it immediately with this video!

But after doing other videos for a handful of months, I decided to stick this in again and try it. Lo and behold, suddenly I'm not annoyed. :-) I appreciate the training in balance and extra core work from having to balance now. And, I like that this video has a nice, steady, more modern musical beat going than a lot of barre videos. A lot of other barre videos have more soothing, almost new-agey music (which I like for them, but the change in this video is nice), or classical piano (which is nice too, but again more modern music in this one is good).

And, why do so many exercise videos feel like they're straight from the 80s!!! This one does not. Her modern attire, along with the music, gives this an up to date feeling.

One thing, the instructor has NO PERSONALITY in this video, but that's OK...it's just, let get to work and get 'er done with this video. :-) No rah rah cheerleader energy with this video. She's not cutesy nor is she a hard-ar*s tough girl...she's just all business in this video.

Anyway, I'm not IN LOVE with this video, thus only 4 starts and not 5. Nonetheless, I do like this video and it's different enough from my other barre videos that it brings something new and fresh to my repertoire. Recommend!",1422489600,10,1639,4.4352159468438535
5015183,1,B006S2WBHY,"This was such a difficult workout.  I am in decent shape and do cardio workouts mostly.  I was even a dancer for years through high school.  I thought this would be more of a ballet inspired workout, but it seems it was just someone who was a dancer who put together all of these crazy hard leg lifts and what-not.  I got through 15 minutes before I gave up b/c I was so frustrated.  My back hurt so much the next day.  Perhaps if I was a body builder I would be able to do this workout.  At best I would rate this as being for advanced people.  Look at the picture on the cover - does she look like any ballerina you have ever seen?",1421107200,4,633,3.9682539682539684

I couldn't quite do all the reps in every movement, but I did the best I could. This is also my first ballet DVD, so I know there's a learning curve too. The cool thing was it didn't just work my abs; it also worked my thighs, shoulders, and back. I'm pretty sore today, in a good way, and I know if I stick to this for a couple months, I'll be ripped in no time.",1416441600,,517,4.029126213592233

This work out kicked my butt, the moves she does are ones I have never seen or done before and you're working hard throughout the entire video.

The music is upbeat and her direction is perfect. Its a voice over, so when you watch her she is not talking but you hear a voice provide direction in-sync with the moves she does. I would classify this as a strength training class that moves so quickly you also get some good cardio in. Great purchase, more challenging then the actual Barre Class!",1414454400,3,668,4.475409836065574
5015189,2,B006S2WBHY,"The reviews were great, but the video is not what I thought.  It has nothing much to do with ballet, the music is irritating to the ear - not at all beautiful, the dull ballet room with strange pink lighting was not too classy, and there was absolutely no warmup.  The exercises were challenging, but I felt it was really overkill for the abs.  I also felt it was not aesthetically made - rather cheaply made, in fact.  I have in the past been involved with exercise video production from all aspects - choreography, acting, and editing, and this was definitely low-budget.  I also don't find the voice-over to be a very effective way of teaching.  However, she definitely works your core.  I just was looking for something more ballet-oriented with beautiful sounding music for a change.",1411862400,3,788,4.708029197080292

Time flies by and a lot of the exercises are different from anything else I have tried so I am hitting muscles a different way.

5015203,2,B006S2WBHY,"Outside of using the ballet positions, this DVD has nothing really to do with ballet. It is mostly yoga. I tore both ACLs and was looking for a slow introduction back to ballet since I can't really kneel. This DVD did not provide the workout I expected. I've only used it once but I plan to give it to goodwill.",1376611200,5,311,4.2
5015204,5,B006S2WBHY,"I've been doing the Ballet Body DVD workouts for a few weeks now and am really impressed. I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who likes barre-type workouts. Ballet Body is more intense than Callanetics and much more precise and focused than Tracy Anderson's workouts.

I think these DVDs are best for intermediate exercisers. You'll need some familiarity with the fundamentals of yoga, or pilates, or barre workouts in order to get the most out of these DVDs and not injure yourself, e.g. knowing how to position your pelvis, back, shoulders, and head during the mat ab work. Leah gives some pointers, but I don't think it's enough instruction for someone who's completely new to this genre of exercise.

The core workout is about 45 minutes long with no warm-up (I don't mind since I have my own warm-up routine. Again, this DVD is clearly not meant for beginners) There is standing work that challenges your balance and is quite fun to do as it is based on ballet. Then it's down to the floor for things like side planks and c-curve moves. The workout ends with some stretches.

What I really appreciate about this workout is that it has a lot of variety. It's not just endless variations of crunches. Your obliques, upper and lower abs, transversus abdominis (corset muscles), and back will all get attention. And quite a few of the exercises also work your legs, glutes, and arms too. My core has always been my weak point and I would rate this routine as challenging, but not impossible to do, though I need to take breaks sometimes to get through the whole thing.

The cuing is excellent. Leah has a business-like manner which I prefer. There's no extraneous chatter, just straightforward instruction. The music is typical dance-y aerobics music, not great but not bad either.

Results: This is a very effective core routine. I began to see my stomach flattening out after doing this DVD a few times (along with moderate cardio). After another few sessions, I saw more definition. My abs also feel harder and stronger if you poke my stomach. I've never gotten results this good from other exercise DVDs!",1376265600,3,2112,4.7753424657534245
5015205,3,B006S2WBHY,Some of the exercise could have been better filmed. The camera angles wasn't great. It is a good 45 minutes exercises the floor work out was the best part. I am using it in my weekly rotation,1375747200,2,191,4.1891891891891895
5015206,5,B006S2WBHY,Works out your core much better than other videos I have tried. Have only gotten through part of the workout. This is an easy workout you don't feel like you are working your Abs until later. You don't need a lot of room for the exercises.,1373241600,,239,4.217391304347826

It does not deal with the average sit up, and you never go back to any of the moves, you just keep transitioning to different ones.  Def a good non-boring ab workout.  Plus its a voice over with just one person.  I do not like the group workouts with the one individual jumping around and stuff, this one keeps you more focused.  The music is also modern and up beat.  Very good DVD!",1369353600,2,478,4.2555555555555555

5015214,5,B006S2WBHY,I LOVE this workout.  I am an advanced exerciser.  I usually do Cathe Friedrich videos.  This core workout was challenging even for me and the exercises are so different and fun.  I love the fluidity of the ballet bar workouts.  They are much more feminine and flowing.  Leah is awesome.  Her figure is inspiring and her movements are so beautiful to watch.  Try this workout!  You won't be disappointed!,1368489600,2,404,4.739130434782608

5015217,5,B006S2WBHY,"These exercises make me feel muscles that I didn't even know I had.  I feel results immediately (and I can't even get through the whole DVD, yet.)  My one gripe is that I don't think she provides enough of a warm-up or focus on form.  You almost have to figure it out on your own based on what feels right for your body and what feels wrong.  I wouldn't even mind it if she just added a separate little 15 minute warm-up, independent of the workout that focuses on form.  Then, you could choose to do that part in the beginning (or as a refresher) and it wouldn't interfere with the workout itself.  As a work-around, I perform the exercises slower than she does until I know that I am doing them correctly.",1361404800,,707,4.2781954887218046
5015218,5,B006S2WBHY,"I really love this workout!! I thought that doing 45 min. of core work would be boring and kind of a waste of time since my mid section is not really where I need work. But I found that this really works a lot of other areas- the back, butt, & legs at the same time. I found it very effective and it seemed to go by really fast! I love her workouts!!",1360627200,,350,3.808219178082192
5015219,3,B006S2WBHY,"I bought the entire Ballet Body 3-DVD series.  The is my least favorite of the series but only because I didn't feel really worked out considering it was 45 minutes in length.  For that reason, I think this is a workout more appropriate to a low intermediate exerciser than an advanced exerciser. I have a lot of shorter workouts that do a lot more in less time, so regretfully I had to knock off two stars for that reason only.  However, I did find the initial standing exercises to be very unique and quite a balance challenge. This is also an enjoyable, no-dread core workout and that says a lot since I don't usually enjoy core work.  Leah's movements have a lovely, dancer-like flow and elegance to them.  Truly a quality instructor!

The production quality is simple but pretty. Leah is in a ballet studio with violet lighting. Leah also carefully chose special music, which is a relief next to the mass producers who usually use generic, elevator sounding music. There are no background exercisers and Leah does voiceover rather than live cueing.",1360195200,6,1053,4.726775956284153

Unlike the lower body and upper body DVDs, I don't break a sweat doing this workout, so I'm not sure what I'm accomplishing. I'll keep trying it and if I get to a burn I'll update, but I'm not sure it's going to happen!

The upper body workout by ballet body - which I love - is a lot of plank work. If done correctly, it engages your core and then you are working both areas. I'd spend my money on that one.",1357430400,4,567,3.8461538461538463

My lower back and neck were hurting the next day so I'm not sure if it's the combination of moves or the lack of form cuing that was the culprit. As an avid barre and Pilates enthusiast, I always aim for perfect form and this video did little to discuss proper pelvic alignment or how to decrease tension in your neck by keeping your shoulders wide and down, etc. So if you are new to Pilates or barre, be careful with this series. I would say I'm in decent shape and the workout was semi challenging, but I didn't feel much soreness in the abs the next day, which I usually look forward too after a new workout.

I had a hard time with the standing abs because the camera angles were weird so I had a hard time execute the moves with proper form. And I felt like a lot of my hip flexors were working instead of the abs. I like some of the floor work, but I also had an insanely hard time because I am super inflexible and I can't straighten my legs. I'm sorry, I tried to like it.

I really like the upper and the lower body DVDs though. They are really intense but more doable for me. I can feel the burn too.

Having said that, I was a bit meh about the standing core work.  It did add some balance work but I am likely to skip it next time. (I do like balance exercises but just have better options.)I also felt that the quick side planks felt kind of like they were just thrown in. For me, the really great workout started 12-13 minutes into the practice at the start of the ab work.  I LOVED that section, and liked using the Upper Body mat work in combination with it. I suspect I will use the two DVDs together quite a bit, just skipping to the third chapter on the Core DVD.",1340496000,,744,4.103448275862069
5015240,5,B006S2WBHY,"I have been wanting to get back into exercise, after my two month long break, so I ordered this DVD, along with the upper body Ballet Body workout.  I had been doing a regular Iyengar yoga routine in the mornings for a few years, but I felt that I wasn't really targeting my core, and I also felt bored by my workout.  I did this DVD this morning, and it was really tough.  There were certain movements that I literally couldn't do at all.  I guess I need to get my legs back in shape.  Anyway, it does a really good job of stretching your core muscles, and it is very extensive.  I also think that the exercises go from most difficult to easiest, ending with stretching.  I plan to do this two times a week, and I will update my review after a month or so to note the progress.  If you buy this, make sure you eat a LOT of protein right after the workout, as your body needs it to build muscle.  I have a lot of friends who go to the gym and they don't eat enough protein, so they never see results or definition.  Nutrition is key for seeing results quickly :)

UPDATE: So, I did this workout on Wednesday (for the first time ever), and I swear I can see a difference in definition in my stomach.  I see muscles that I have never seen before, especially the external ones.  I honestly cannot believe it, but this DVD really does work.  I swear that it has accessed muscles that have never been worked before.  I will be doing this once a week for sure, until I'm strong enough to do it twice a week.  I am very lean, and muscle mass usually shows up rather quickly on my frame, but this is truly remarkable :)",1339372800,9,1611,4.131832797427653

5015242,3,B006S2WBHY,So this DVD is a great core workout. My biggest problem with it is the fact that Leah does not warm your body up at all. And with these kind of moves you must warm up. If you've never had ballet or dance lessons you could possibly hurt yourself. That being said the exercises are quite awesome and very effective. Bummer that she just goes right into the exercises without even warming up is a huge flaw.,1337644800,10,404,4.259740259740259

It doesn't waste any time with explanations (that would be a problem for someone who has no background, but if you know the basic body positions and need few explanations and just want the solid workout without the extensive set up verbiage then this is one DVD you want for your home work out collection.
