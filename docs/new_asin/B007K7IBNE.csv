8518975,4,B007K7IBNE,"Fun to watch, but only mediocre picture quality.  My guess is that this was the best quality picture that was available. It's a great one-time watch.  Good stars in a somewhat free form atmosphere.",1418860800,2,197,4.764705882352941

8518978,5,B007K7IBNE,The DVD is a nice collection of the favorite stars of the 50's and 60's  ...hosted by Edward R Murrow.  Nicely done,1400457600,2,115,4.181818181818182
8518979,5,B007K7IBNE,"In 2006 CBS released a 3-DVD set of the ""best"" interviews from the classic 1950s TV interview program ""Person to Person"" where news legend Edward R. Murrow (complete with is always lit cigarette smoking away) sat in a studio in New York while interviewing celebrities in there own home. I loved the set when it came out.

Now eOne has broken the series into very affordable single volumes. Of which this is the first. The 2  hour DVD contains 11 separate interviews (actually ""visits"") each lasting about 14 minutes. I could go into details of interviews with all - like Bette Davis, Kirk Douglas, Liz Taylor and then husband Mike Todd or Bogie and Bacall, but that would spoil the fun. Instead I'll just mention two great moments. The Marlon Brando interview includes not only his father (!) but also Brando serenades us with a music performance on bongo drums. (By the way, this interview was done just two nights after Brando received his Oscar! And in Gene Kelly's interview he mentions that in two more days he was going to be presenting a show called ""Men in Dance"" on the Sunday show ""Omnibus"". As it turns out eONE is issuing that show on DVD next month for the first time. (I'm psyched!).

If you are old enough, you'll remember these great interviews - and Murrow does ask some off the wall questions - but if you are younger and the list of classic actors peaks your interest, you'll want to pick up the volume. I enjoyed watching these again.

And, oh, did I mention the interview with Marilyn Monroe? Classic TV!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
