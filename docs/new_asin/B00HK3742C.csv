8633181,3,B00HK3742C,"I received the ""Mythbusters Complete DVD Box Set Seasons 1-15"" in March 2017 from a non-Amazon.com and non-Discovery Channel dealer.  In the set that I received, there are a total of approximately 179 episodes on the 75 discs in 4 separate disc cases.  Of the 179 episodes, 34 are duplicates.  The episodes in this set extend from the 3 pilot episodes in 2003 through November 2011.  (The series ended after 5 more years in 2016.)

After review of each of the 75 discs content I found that discs labeled for Seasons 8 through 12 contained the 34 duplicate episodes that are also contained in discs labeled for Seasons 2 through 7.  The discs labeled seasons 8 through 12 contain the following number of duplicate episodes found on the previous discs: season 8 - 6 episodes; season 9 - 7 episodes; season 10 - 9 episodes; season 11 - 8 episodes, season 12 - 4 episodes.  (In contrast, the number of duplicates for each season year are as follows: 2003 season -1 duplicate; 2004 season - 1 duplicate; 2006 season - 5 duplicates; 2007 season - 6 duplicates; 2008 season - 9 duplicates; 2009 season - 10 duplicates; and season 2010 - 2 duplicates.)  As can be seen, much if not most of labeled seasons 8 through 12 are essentially useless as far as individual content is concerned because of these duplications.

These DVDs appear to be the Discovery channels Mythbusters Collections, even though they have Season on the labels.  Collection and Season are not necessarily the same thing in this case as more than one seasonal boundary is crossed by episodes on the same disc.  It is noted that Discovery Channel appears to use the designations of 'Season' and 'Collection' as well when it comes to Mythbusters products.

The 8 through 12 Seasons (aka Collection) that I received also do not always appear to contain the correct Collection episodes based on what I find elsewhere for similar Collection sets.

Also, season 8 has what looks like Chinese subtitles throughout the episodes.

Im beginning to feel sorry I even bought this set of DVDs.  Id like a full refund, even though I understand this may not be likely since I had to remove the plastic over wrap to check out the discs to begin with.",1492905600,17,2196,4.682291666666667
8633182,5,B00HK3742C,PLEASE make/sell these again. Not EVERYONE prefers digital and it's not fair to force people into it. I know I'm not alone.,1490313600,11,123,4.636363636363637
8633183,4,B00HK3742C,"The only reason why we didn't give this a 5 is because season ""15"" in this box set is not the actual season 15 so when this was made they broke it up way differently than what the shows are labeled as. the first episode of the box set season 15 is actually episode 5 season 11, Flying guillotine. We have the actual box set bought off the discovery channel store so it must be the way they divided them up to be watched, averaging about 5-7 disks a season. it is still a great box set and is thoroughly enjoyable.",1392336000,24,513,4.089108910891089
