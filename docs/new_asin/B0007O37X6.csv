8049393,5,B0007O37X6,"I never have watched one episode of 24 before I bought this DVD. All I ever hear about is how great 24 is, so I thought I'd go ahead and give it a try. This is a must buy! I have become very interested in seeing how this season ends after watching the first two episodes. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this has made me a big fan, I've only seen these two episodes and that's it, so it's too soon to say that, but I'm getting there. This also comes with a coupon that saves money on any season of 24, how can I resist? I do plan to use the coupon to see how this season is, and who knows, I may end up getting the others as well. I'm very surprised that such a quality of a television show could come out of network TV like FOX. Worthy of HBO. The only extras on this DVD are commercials for the season DVDs for all three seasons of 24, Tru Calling, and Murder One. So if you're like me and never have actually sat down and watched 24, I recommend this DVD, after watching it you'll know if this series is for you or not. And I have to say, it's for me.",1121212800,4,1058,3.835616438356164
8049394,5,B0007O37X6,"In a recent effort to get casual fans interested in their TV products on DVD, Fox has released two episode starter sets of several of their shows.  Reasonably priced, they tempt the viewer to buy the first season and even provide a coupon for the purchase price of the sampler off the price of the complete first season if offered.  The casual fan has little to loose.

Here, Fox is offering the first two episodes of season 1 of 24, the most addicting thrill ride on TV today.  Just as the Bauer family is about to call it a night, Jack gets a phone call that sends him into work.  CTU has a credible threat on Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer.  Meanwhile, daughter Kim sneaks out for a night with friends and Teri goes off after her.  And Senator Palmer is facing a potential blackmail crisis of his own.

This show did take a few episodes of fully suck me in, but the trouble with this set is it most likely will.  If you are a marginal fan of the show, having two episodes just isn't going to cut it.  You'll need to have the complete first season to have all of what happens next.  And, of course, you'll enjoy every minute of it.

This is brilliant marketing on Fox's part.  You'll be buying the complete set before you can say cliffhanger.  That coupon is going to come in very handy.",1112486400,8,1302,4.348547717842323
