3611967,5,B001GJOL5E,"This was a fun and fat burning video. They encourage you the entire time, make you feel good about yourself by the time it's done. Along with the fact that you can tell they are real women. They mess up and keep on going. They make the workout fun. But by the time your done you feel  the burn. They say things like "" I'm so happy to be stretching and not doing squats. They were killing me."" They make little jokes through out the workout. They have a section that if you only have 5 mins to work out then do it. I highly enjoyed this boot camp. It made me feel good about myself. I recommend this product to other women no matter what shape or size, get up and get butt kicking awesome! They don't care if you never get super skinny, just healthy!",1230249600,2,749,4.095238095238095
3612028,1,B001GJOL5E,"What a huge letdown.  I don't mind the language, as some other reviewers did (if you mind cursing, why buy something with this title?)  But I did expect to get... well... a workout.  Too much to ask? You'll got a lot of talking, some really poor transitions, and two chicks who have ZERO sense of rhythm.  I don't know if they just laid the horrible music track over the workout later, but they aren't following it at all and it gets really irritating when you're trying to keep a sensible rhythm to your movements.  There also didn't seem to be much planning.  It seems like they got two girls with forced snarky personalities (this is not the Chelsea Handler-esque banter I was hoping for, but rather a very hollow Paris Hilton imitation) and let them fly by the seat of their pants in front of the cameras.  You could probably get a better, more structured workout by playing Twister. Not worth the money.",1371254400,3,908,4.533742331288344
3612029,3,B001GJOL5E,"I bought this product with no expectations, not reading the skinny bitch books. It's not the most strenuous workout in the universe, but it's great for beginners. I'm pretty in shape, so I breezed through the entire video without breaking a sweat. That is not an ego boost, that's an indicator of the difficulty level of the dvd. I jog twice a week and walk to work, and I was fine. If you work 9-5 at a desk and need something to get your body moving, this is good. If you are at least relatively in shape, this isn't for you.",1369612800,,527,4.227722772277228
3612030,3,B001GJOL5E,"Didn't enjoy all the talking and ""skinny bitch"" conditations.  Not very challenging..  Too much ""bitch'n"".
Wouldn't recommend it to my friends.",1368576000,,143,5.761904761904762
3612031,3,B001GJOL5E,"I bought this for $9.99 so I figured I'd give it a try.  Only afterwards did I read people's review on Amazon.  The majority of the reveiws were not good so I was almost leary of taking off the shrink-wrap.

Okay, I admit it the camera work is not great and the ladies talk WAY too much but the work-out itself is not bad for someone like me, a commuter who sits at a desk most of the day with little time to hit a gym.  If you are a die-hard gym rat this is not the DVD for you.  They break down the cardio and weights into maybe 5-8 min segments so the work-out moves along fairly well.  Also, they don't do a LONG segment on any one thing making you sore and give up quickly.  They work a few muscles and move on so.  I also like the 5 minute work-outs at the end for when I don't have time for the entire work-out.

So yes, they talk too much, pretend grunting as they do squats and lunges and lift lite weights, and yes they tend to use the word bitches, etc., too much but it's a gimmick so just try to block it all out.

The camera work too does not zoom in on things like their choreography, feet, etc., but once I did this routine a few times I remembered basic steps and was able to work up a decent sweat.  Also, once I know the routines better I'll up my lite weights to heavier hand-held weights.

I tried two DVDs from Julienne Hough (Dancing with the Stars) and her choreography was crazy difficult to follow.  This DVD is way better and easier to follow so I won't be adding it to the Good Will pile which is where the Julienne Hough DVDs are sitting right now.",1365033600,,1577,4.032154340836013
3612032,1,B001GJOL5E,"I just had to rate this because it's so bad!  I've never done an exercise video that was so lacking in so many ways.  I'm usually fairly positive, and I don't think I've ever given anything one star before.  Thankfully I was just borrowing this and did not actually spend money on it!  They should have practiced!  They didn't explain what they were going to do, they just started doing it, and left their audience trying to catch up.  And, the workout wasn't hard!  I'm not super-hardcore, but I like a good workout.  I didn't really feel like I had worked out after this was over.  Also, they chattered endlessly through the whole thing.  And, their chatter was not helpful, and sometimes rather nonsensical.  Truly, if you're considering buying this video, borrow it from someone (or your library) first so you can see what it's like.  ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" by Erin O'Brien is great, as is the Cardio Burn Series by Tonja Djelavic (sp?).  Happy exercising!",1353974400,2,965,4.706586826347305
3612033,5,B001GJOL5E,"I absolutely love this dvd, so I wanted to share my positive experience with it.  If you don't like the style of the banter, I can see how it would quickly get very annoying, but I quite like it (maybe I'm just weird) as it's similar to how many of my friends talk to each other.  The exercises are not going to be a challenge for someone who already frequently works out, but for someone who does minimal (or in my case, no) exercise, this really does push you.

Before purchasing this dvd, I did no exercise at all.  The five-minute workouts at the end of the dvd were what got me to realise I could exercise everyday - they're a great introduction to exercise and perfect to fit in when you're rushed off your feet.  I also found them great to fit in during study breaks to re-energise me during the last few months of my degree.  Now the only workout videos I own are the Skinny Bitch fitness range, I do something on most days, and have dropped two clothes sizes as a result.

Admittedly the editing is a bit shabby in places, but if you're involved in the exercises there is no time to be frustrated with this.  As someone new to exercising, it took me a while to work up to doing the whole bootcamp.  The only equipment you need is a set of weights (and a mat for the abs exercises), although I'm now trying to increase the weights I use.  The instructor recommends watching the dvd through once without following, so you have an idea of what it involves, which is probably a good idea - I kept up with the changing moves, but when I did the same workout with my mum she lost track a bit.  But with practice you'll get the hang of it anyway, and Rory and Kim make it clear that mess-ups are fine!

The length of the main workout does make it impractical to do everyday (I prefer the 15-20 minute workouts in Skinny Bitch Body for that purpose), but when I feel I need to do a bit more, this ticks all the boxes.

The Skinny Bitch fitness philosophy is not about perfection, and I love that their own mistakes are included.  It made me feel far less self-conscious and critical of my own mistakes, especially as someone new to exercise.  There are preview clips available online (search for ""Skinny Bitch fitness"" on google video), so you can get an idea of if you like the banter - if you do, I highly recommend this.  Yes, the language is similar to that of the books - if you don't like blunt, sometimes offensive language, this is not for you.  If you're already a fitness dvd fan, chances are you'll have seen the moves before in different combinations and won't be especially challenged by it.  But if you like their style and the level of difficulty, I absolutely love and highly recommend this dvd (and the rest of the series).",1343433600,,2741,4.3203125
3612034,1,B001GJOL5E,"This fitness DVD (oh heck, I can't call it a fitness dvd) is a big joke. Please save your money and do not purchase. I can bearly even hear the instruction and follow it because the one ""instructor"" (the blonde one) never shuts up. The worst part is she had absolutely nothing of value to say. They had absolutely no enthusiasm and were completely unmotivating. I am embarrassed that I wasted my money on this joke of a DVD. I am tempted to write to them myself and ask for my money back.",1313280000,2,488,4.258064516129032
3612035,5,B001GJOL5E,"I want to start by saying I also own Physique 57, Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred, and the Skinny Bitch: Body DVDs.  And even though I've had this DVD for over a year now, it still is my favorite of all four.  It is the most fun and that to me is the most important factor in a workout DVD, because it keeps me wanting to go back to it, and better yet, working out.  If I'm not feeling that great about having to work out, I pop this in and suddenly 45 minutes has gone by, and I've actually enjoyed the entire workout.  They are not fitness instructors, they make mistakes (and they do TELL you they will because they are human), they forget to count or to cue you as to what to do next but honestly, that is why I love it so much.  After doing it a few times I already know what's next.  I don't need perfection, just motivation, and I have that with this DVD.

The best things about this video are (and why they surpass the other videos):
-The general variety of the moves
-The ab work
-The stretching
-The no-excuses attitude (that is motivation, not belittlement, as I've seen people complain of with Jillian Michael's)
-The down to earth, ""girlfriend"" type speech
-The music
-The 5x5, which are 5, 5 minute targeted workouts that you can do anywhere, anytime (again, no excuses)

One negative thing I have to say is they do talk a lot at the beginning, however, I make use of the fast forward feature for that minor nuisance.  It's not a big deal, and I don`t understand why anyone would think this is ""self-promotion.""  I would say it's more ""lengthy motivation.""  The talking during the workout doesn't bother me either, in fact it's probably what I like most.  They have fun, I have fun.

The other negative is the camera angles.  For example, sometimes it's hard to tell which leg they're using when they're doing a move, because they are both wearing black pants (the legs look the same), and other times the angle is just weird and for a second I'm not sure what move is even being done and/or how.  It's annoying, but not enough to de-motivate me.

I can't say it's the hardest workout routine, but it was when I started.  In fact that should say something in and of itself, that I am where am now because these videos motivated me and got me to like exercise.  Now, after moving up to P57, there's a lot of places I'll use weights when they don't tell you you need to, or I'll hold the move longer instead of stopping and going back into it, and I'm fine with that.  So, if you're already at an intermediate to advanced fitness level, I wouldn't buy this just for the workout, but I don't think these videos were intended for that audience anyway.

If you're conservative or like instructors who do everything perfectly and are very serious about it, this is not the workout for you.  I do HIGHLY recommend P57 and 30 Day Shred if you fall into that category, they are both amazing workout DVDs in their own way.  If you're not big into veganism or healthy living in general you will also easily find something to not like about this video.  I however, am very appreciative of their goal to get other women to ""be happy, healthy, and in great shape"" and I think they've accomplished that and more, by producing a workout video that does get me moving and more importantly, enjoying it.",1309651200,4,3298,4.3881578947368425
3612036,1,B001GJOL5E,"This is definitely the worst workout video I've ever tried to do. They give you no instruction and the camera doesn't even stay in place long enough for you to see what their feet are doing at times. They are often not in time with the music, make mistakes, offer no guidance. Worst, if you were a beginner, they offer no tips for safety or alignment. Plus, it's not hard enough to get your heart going-- but is better than sitting on the couch.",1301702400,2,445,4.309523809523809
3612037,4,B001GJOL5E,"Wow, I must say I am surprised by all these negative reviews! I have been working out tot this dvd for some time now and it is one of the most fun workouts I've done!

Kim and Rory are at it again with Bootcamp! Get ready to have your butt-kicked because this is one intense workout. The main workout, bootcamp, is a mixture of fast-paced, non-stop cardio routines with a nice amount of arm work done with weights. Basically you do one set cardio, one set weights, then you rotate again, but each time its something new. This workout is really fun, because obviously its Skinny Bitch, but also because of the fast pace. It keeps you going for about thirty-forty minutes and by the end your butt has been whooped!
Some of the exercises include lunges, squats, twists, jumping jacks, and just all around fast-paced movements. It incorporates arms, legs, abs, butt, just everything is being stretched and pulled in this workout! It is so much fun because you really get motivated and you have a fun time with this workout routine. Even though it's tough, I do it over and over whenever I want a good solid workout because it is just so much fun. The soundtrack alone is bouncy and fun to listen to. Of course the girls are cracking their jokes, as well...

There is a separate workout routine on the disc called ""five-by-fives"" which is five five-minute workouts, targeting abs, butt, arms, legs, and one yoga routine which is a little longer than five minutes (maybe 10-15 min). These workouts are fun to do by themselves or all together if you are pressed for time. You can literally just do one five minute workout to target a specific area if you don't feel like doing a big workout but want to get something in for the day.

One aspect I don't like is how Rory and Kim are always commenting on how ""you shouldn't eat cr*p"" and ""you should change your life."" I don't think they should assume just because it is a dvd that the women using it only eat junk food and never exercised before, because that isn't true. I just found that bit slightly annoying which is why I gave it four stars.

But that's no biggie! Overall it is a great, fun, intense workout which WILL get you sweating by the end if you are doing it right and making a real effort. I don't know if some reviewers didn't like it because they didn't get anything out of it, but I will say you probably have to be fit to do this workout. If you are starting unfit, go with their Body dvd. This one may be a little too intense to start with. I highly recommend this workout; have fun with it!",1294185600,3,2553,4.391120507399577
3612048,5,B001GJOL5E,"I have a very hard time getting into workout routines and this one makes it easy for me to start and stay with it. The comments that this routine is a breeze or too easy are false in my opinion. I have been doing them for two weeks now and I have lost 6 pounds already and I am always drenched in sweat and huffing by the time it's time to stretch. If you are a lighthearted and fun person, these DVDs are perfect for you! Rory and Kim are entertaining and a little bit out there. Sometimes it is a little hard to follow and they occasionally mess up but in my opinion it just makes it easier to relate to and love them! If you are a more ""hard core"" workout fanatic, this probably isn't the program for you, but if you are a regular everyday female that wants to lose weight without having to be so stuck up and serious, THIS IS THE WORKOUT FOR YOU!!!!",1291420800,4,853,4.053254437869822
3612049,1,B001GJOL5E,"I found this DVD at a garage sale for $1 and thought that it would be worth a try.  Now I see why the seller was trying to get rid of it.

From the start there was a lot of unnecessary talking, and the B word was dropped at least 5 times in the first 30 seconds.  I fast forwarded to the actual workout and found they were still using the word so I had to mute it so my 3 year old wouldn't pick up on the word.  If you have kids, you probably wouldn't want to do this video with them around.

The workout didn't get my heart rate up.  There were unnecessary pauses with more talking.  The blonde girl didn't even look like she was trying (pretend workout is right!), and obviously neither of these ladies know anything about fitness training.  Some of the moves seemed like they could be harmful to your knees (for example) if done incorrectly (or at all).  Since the video was muted, I couldn't tell if they were commenting on proper technique or not, but I would guess not.

I quit the video less than half way through since it was such a waste of time.  It's going straight to the Goodwill box.",1286841600,2,1097,4.151658767772512
3612050,5,B001GJOL5E,"I have tried many workout videos that were hard to keep doing every day so they ended up never being used. After going to college and gaining some unwanted pounds from eating like a pig, even though I am a vegan, I came home for the summer and wiped into shape. I am following their diet outlined in the book, which is obviously vegan. I also took it a step further and am eating raw foods only. I also started doing this video every day. After two weeks of doing this I have lost ten pounds and four inches around my waist. I am ready to kick it up a notch by adding their body sculpting video too. I have been able take control of my eating and I will probably eat mostly raw even after my goal of a month. I feel energetic and healthy. This video makes me sweat every day but at the same time its fun and fast paced and changes enough so you don't get bored. The girls are funny and make it less of a chore. I actually enjoy working out. The do have lengthy introductions but a couple clicks of the remote to skip sections and its right there. Exercise videos always have some boring introduction like its your first time watching it, at least this videos intros are in chapters so you can skip to the good stuff really easily.

3612052,3,B001GJOL5E,"I bought this DVD despite the bad reviews because Amazon was selling it for around $6.  I'm glad I didn't spend anymore on this DVD.

The DVD has a 5 minute warm up, 25 minutes of cardio (which consists of cardio intervals and strength training), 10 minutes of abs and a 5 minute stretch.  The cardio length is a little short for my taste.

The girls chatter NON STOP during the entire DVD and even talk over each other at times.  Sometimes, the chatter was funny, but it gets old really fast.  They mess up quite a bit.  You can tell they're looking at someone off screen to know what to do and Rory even asks several times, ""What's next?"". Neither woman cues AT ALL.  Both of them are looking at someone do the moves off camera and just transition between moves with no warning.  That being said, the moves are very easy and you can catch on quickly, even though there's no cueing.  I did get a decent workout, but I usually did the hardest cardio interval demonstrated for the entire cardio interval.  During the strength training the girls move really quickly.  Both girls say not to swing the weights, but the movements are so fast, you can't have slow and controled movements.  The ab workout was good and had a variety of exercises and advanced and beginner options were shown.
With all the bashing out of the way, this DVD wasn't that awful.  If you can find a used copy, or catch an Amazon sale, it's ok.  I'll do this DVD again, but I'm an intermediate to advanced exercisor, so this will be for my easy days. I would recommend this DVD for beginners, except for the fact that there's no cueing.  I think a beginner would be frustrated really quickly.  Whenever moves are demonstrated, the girls do show beginner versions, for people who may not be ready for the more intense exercises.",1263340800,3,1796,4.476923076923077

More like sleep-away camp with all the giggling and complaining. Their girly ""too cool"" banter during the duration of the video is extremely obnoxious, and its immediately clear upon the beginning of the dvd that they have NO idea what they are doing. Half of the video they are paused and looking to the person behind the camera to see what they are suppose to do next! They have no idea what the proper names of the moves are, and are not doing them properly at all. Half of the time the camera man is zoomed in on the women's faces so you cant even tell what you are suppose to be doing! They do not announce the workout changes, or explain at all what you are suppose to be doing and its extremely hard to follow along. I didn't even break a sweat! In all, this is a PATHETIC excuse for a workout video and a complete waste of money. Im extremely upset that I opened the packaging at all, as I cannot return it now and get a FULL refund. Its so sad that women across the country want to listen to what these flaky, ridiculous women have to say.

I am an intermediate exerciser- although this dvd will not cause you to work up a sweat, you will work your muscles and get your heart rate up.  The moves are innovative and different.  It moves quickly- I will admit the cueing sucks, but you will not be bored, because they switch up the moves frequently.

They do a few repititions of a few moves - then move on to a different body part.

This workout works you head to toe.  I did it a few hours ago, and I am already feeling it.  I would recommend checking this workout out and decide for yourself.",1254441600,3,626,4.2100840336134455

Whomever says they didn't break a sweat with this video needs to visit a physician cuz something is wrong with their sweat glands. I've been doing the Skinny Bitch videos since January of this year and I have yet to get bored of any of the 3 DVDs that I own. I always look forward to seeing them and laughing with them.

Anyway, this was great for me and I know what people are talking about how it quickly changes moves without notices but it's very easy to jump into the next move when you see what was happening.  I have collection of fitness dvds but rarely try them again after doing it.  One, I am a beginner, and two, I get bored easily.  I am a gym member for the past 15 years (a gift from my mom who bribed me for allowing her to transfer me to another city's High School) but only go to the gym when I feel like it, which is like 4x a year.  A lot of reviewers complained that they don't sweat; maybe it's true for them.  However, since I don't work out too much I really sweat with this one.  The girls talks too much, which it's a problem for most reviewers, but it helps me to move along without realizing that I was working out.  The moves are fun not boring like most fitness dvds I owed.  I like how there are 2 levels of personal endurances on the same workout (take it easy or push yourself).  After using this for a week my friend wants it back right away.  I ordered one for myself.  I love it.

Although I DO agree with the cueing being terrible, once you watch it once or twice, you should be able to move along with them with no problem.  It definitely gets the blood pumping!  While I also agree that sometimes the whining gets a little old, I feel that way with ANY exercise DVD's commentary.  It's repetitive; but you're watching the same video over and over, OF COURSE IT'S REPETITIVE!  I recommend watching it with the commentary the first few times you do it (so you can make sure you know what you're supposed to be doing), then muting and listening to your own music thereafter.

The language is ""bad"" in a few places, but the video and the book are called Skinny Bitch, what do you expect?

3612072,4,B001GJOL5E,"I bought the Skinny Bitches Boot Camp DVD after previewing part of the program on Exercise TV. The workout itself is an interval workout with modifications offered that are lower impact. There's an abdominal section at the end and a good cool down/stretch section. Also included are five workouts that are five minutes in length. I found the narrative from Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin amusing; it seems designed to be like working out with old friends rather than fitness gurus.

I had two issues with the DVD; one is that the routine is not broken down for you, it just jumps from move to move. At times, even the girls leading the routine seem lost. The second is that when you start the DVD and select Play All, there's an awful lot of talking before you get to the routine itself. Be prepared to fast forward through this. I will say that those who don't like cursing should probably skip this one; the title alone is indicative of this and it does carry through the routine.

Overall, I liked the routine; it's fun and it's a good workout.",1239753600,9,1047,4.534391534391534

3612074,1,B001GJOL5E,I was really disappointed with this video.  It was difficult to follow because they would change moves while the camera was focused on one person's face/torso and they did not give many verbal cues - they were too busy making snarky comments.  My biggest pet peeve with fitness videos is when they work one side of your body and not the other - and this one did that!  I feel like that is a big oversight in developing a workout.  I did this video once and won't be doing it again.,1238112000,2,481,4.252747252747253

This is a horrible excuse for an exercise video, so unless you plan on using this video as a coaster (the only purpose it will serve in your home), don't buy it.",1236902400,12,394,4.103896103896104

These girls might be fun to have a drink with, but they aren't fitness trainers. The blonde woman acts like she's in an Anna Faris role - not really awake, laughs at anything. The brown-haired woman just likes to yell bitch as much as she can. Both flail their arms without any instruction and stare robotically at ... the actual trainer? The teleprompter?

There are no transitions, no call outs, no instruction.  It's as if they showed up one day and just turned on the camera.  If you have ever done any kind of aerobics, have rhythm or know how to dance, you will be extremely frustrated within the first two minutes.  The moves don't match the music and they fluctuate between 1 and 3, with 2 and 4.  Do NOT buy this.",1234915200,10,488,4.094736842105263

3612101,1,B001GJOL5E,"This workout is highly disappointing. These girls are obviously not fitness instructors, the worst part about this workout is the complete lack of cueing. They go from move to move with a countdown, but only once or twice do they tell you what move you'll be doing next. The way they act, you can tell they're taking cues from someone off-screen, I have to assume it's an instructor, to which I say put THAT person on screen and have these girls do the workout and add commentary. Not that the commentary is good, mind you, it's not. Don't waste your time on this one.",1233014400,4,568,4.471153846153846
3612102,4,B001GJOL5E,"Here's the thing - you should probably read through the books before working out with them.  They have a distinct style of talking to their audiences and, from the look of some of the reviews here, some women weren't ready for it.

I actually had a lot of fun with this work out.  It's not as strenuous as my normal morning routine, but if you ever come home from work stressed out or annoyed or just plain angry, this is a fantastic stress relieving alternative to grabbing that bag of chips.  There's a casual feel to it (the girls mess up the moves regularly) but I still broke a sweat.  Anyone who puts their heart into it for 50 minutes is gonna get a workout.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.

It's a style that's probably not for everyone, but I'm a fan.  Their books and philosophy has had me dropping weight for months and feeling like a brand new person.  I love these bitches!",1232841600,,894,4.36969696969697

3612105,3,B001GJOL5E,"I know very little about the two authors of the Skinny Bitch series other than the fact that their two very lucky women. Their tawdry and campy SB books and videos have remained on best sellers lists despite their ""slim"" credentials as health and fitness experts.

The video narrative is poor-for some reason I don't get motivated being called a bitch or being told to put down my twinkies. There are even offensive comments directed at smokers. But the actual choreography is painful to watch as the girls get lost themselves and seem at times disinterested--SB Boot Camp is merely bits and pieces of other successful exercise dvd's lumped together in a hodgepodge.

I own more than a hundred fitness dvd's and this is one of the most poorly executed in terms of direction and instruction. I bought this dvd hoping for a clever and challenging work-out directed at women with flair and fun in mind but in turn got duped by the trendy title and marketing machine of the SB series.

The SB women should never let go of the agents and publicists---ever.",1230595200,25,1051,4.701086956521739
3612106,1,B001GJOL5E,"Catchy title but the whole concept got old within 3 minutes. The workout isn't strenuous or creative, but insipidly tedious and self promoting. I followed the more intense routine and didn't break a sweat. It was almost as if the girls sat down and said ""OK girlfriend, how else can we make money off this franchise of skinny bitchdom??""
Neither are particularly instructive nor appear to have any qualifications to teach an exercise class. The cue card reading is blatant. The camera work and or editing missed the goal of an ""instructional"" DVD. I think they were trying to achieve a girlfriend workout experience, but I felt very much like the only sober woman in a nightclub bathroom.

8305727,5,B001GJOL5E,"Just for reference, I'm in my mid-20s, 5'6, 147lbs, and fairly fit.  I've been doing workout videos since high school, plus I do a lot of jogging and walking.

Ok, now on to the review: If you want to work out the hardest you've ever worked in your life, this isn't it what you're looking for.  Go check out Jillian Michaels's ""Hard Body"" or Jeanette Jenkins's ""Bikini Bootcamp"" instead.
However, if you (like me) already do those workouts and want something different that fulfills the following requirements, then I recommend considering getting the Skinny Bitch DVDs:
- Doesn't make you feel like you're going to die, but still burns calories (this and their Body workout burn 400-500 calories each, according to my heart rate monitor).
- Offers a variety of moves you haven't seen in other workouts.  You can tell the routines were created by a professional trainer (Patrick Goudeau).  Yeah, both women mess up a couple times, but it's really not as bad as most of the reviews here make it seem.  You always see at least one of the backup fitness models/dancers, so it's pretty easy to follow along with the routine during the few times Kim or Rory mess up a little.
- Doesn't trigger your ""exercise ADD"".  Most workout videos spend way too much time on each exercise and I get bored 3 minutes in (Jillian and Jeanette are the exceptions here). The Skinny Bitch workouts flow quickly from move to move, so they stay fun.  To up the burn, I hold 2lb weights during the cardio sequences and switch to 5 or 8lb dumbbells for the toning sequences.
- Has choreography that takes a couple times to get.  For the same reason that it's NOT boring, I didn't pick up the entire choreography instantly.
At the end of the day, I just enjoy these workouts.  The moves and routines are fun and intelligently put together.  That's all I really care about.  When I feel like the banter is too much, I mute the DVD and put my ipod on instead.

Also, I want to respond to the complaint about Kim and Rory introducing themselves in the beginning.  Yes, they should have made it skippable, but c'mon people.  The fast-forward button exists for a reason.  Besides, when I put in my exercise DVDs I'm still pulling on my workout shoes and getting my water bottle, so I always miss the intros anyway.  That one little annoyance has nothing to do with the routines and shouldn't seriously influence how you rate the workouts, IMO.",1391817600,2,2410,4.60655737704918
8305728,5,B001GJOL5E,"Wow, after reading so many negative reviews from people who gave it a 1 star rating, I just HAD to write a review too! So this is mostly a response to all the negative reviews.

First of all, this workout was choreographed by an actual fitness trainer (not by Rory or Kim, who state explicitly that they are NOT fitness trainers). There is even an extra dvd bonus feature interviewing the real trainer who designed this workout and clips of the girls rehearsing the routine. Yes you can see them looking off camera, probably at the real trainer, at times and yes they do make a lot of mistakes and yes they do not know how to give proper cues. But I think that is exactly why I love it so much. It is fun!!!! It actually makes me want to get up & workout. It is the anti-thesis to Jillian Michaels whom I loathe. Anytime an instructor stops mid-rep to give instruction it just plain irks me! With Skinny B you feel as if you are actually ""in it"" with the girls and that they are ""in it"" with you. When Rory says, ""I know this is tough, its obviously tough on us too but we're not quitting,"" as she pants for air, it is encouraging. That is what motivates me, not some drill instuctor barking  orders that even she is not following. What I love most is that Skinny B does NOT have the pretentious attitude that so many workout DVDs have (I'm thinking ""The Firm"" series here...yikes). It feels real, down-to-earth, and most importantly, fun!! All the silly banter even helps the time go by faster & in the end you get a great workout.

Secondly a lot of people complained that the workout was too easy & Kim wasn't even trying. Kim who does the modified version, appears to be doing just that....MODIFYING it. That is why it seems so easy for her. It probably is!! Have you ever seen a modifier not look like she was taking a jog thru the park? I am in pretty good shape, being 5'6 and 130 pounds. I am working on losing the 12 pounds I've gained over the holidays and getting back down to 118 where I am most comfortable. So I am not in perfect condition but I am in pretty good shape. And I must say that if this workout doesn't get your heart going and cause you to drip sweat, either:

1. You are not doing it right (amp the weights to 5-7 pounds) or...

2. You are in mint athletic condition (like ready for the Olympics)

Bottom line is these girls obviously didn't get fab bodies by doing only this workout. You can't get Rory's arms without lifting weights heavier than 3 pounds LOL (which is what they use in the video.) But you can get an amazing workout with this video. Just use some common sense. When the workout as shown gets to easy: use heavier weights, fast-forward thru the unnecessary chit-chat (or better yet do jumping jacks thru those few parts), go deeper in your lunges, run thru the parts where they are just stepping, do each move to the fullest and your heart will start going and the sweat will start dripping. Use your heads people, no one single 45 minute workout routine is gonna get you the body you want. Variety is key. If you hate the gym, like I do, you're gonna have to build up a pretty nice arsenal of workout dvds to get in great shape at home. And that being said, this is a valuable tool to add to your workout dvd collection.

As a side note: This workout is comparable to and got me just as sweaty as P90X's Cardio X and Jackie Warner's Power Circuit Training.",1390953600,2,3403,4.2912772585669785
