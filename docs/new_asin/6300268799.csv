288229,4,6300268799,"I must admit that Ann Margaret has always been a favorite of mine. That probably, make that certainly, affects my judgment of this film. It is not one of John Wayne's best. I still like it. Only part of that is because I like Ann Margaret.

John Wayne plays the leader of a group of gunfighters. These are not ordinary gunfighters. They are not in it for the ""glory"". They just kind of drifted into it after the civil war.  Now, John Wayne and his group find themselves working for a woman, Ann Margaret. She says that her dead husband once robbed a train of half a million dollars. The money was lost and she knows the location. She wants to recover it so that she can turn it in to raise the stigma from her son. She intends to pay the gunfighters with the reward money for turning in the gold.

The would-be rescuers of stolen gold have some problems. They have to track down the train and they are in turn being tracked by a lot of bad guys who want to steal the gold.

John Wayne handles the situation with his typical character. He is honest and protective of those who are with him. He has his own moral code and will not be swayed from it. He would rather do things the hard way if that means maintaining his ideals.

His biggest challenge comes from Ann Margaret. She is strong willed but sweet. Everyone likes her and wants to protect her. They are even willing to give up their share of the reward to help her. She's got them wrapped around her little finger.

Its fun and action packed but it is not his best. Still, watching Ann is lots of fun.",1139356800,27,1557,4.243243243243243
288230,2,6300268799,"Although it is great to see Wayne seeing him is about the best in this film. I did not really care about these people riding left and right. It has to be something about the story, because the actors are a great bunch of people. I expect Wayne always to be real hero, but here it is not so. Take any other Wayne, even those of the 30's rather than this one.",1115683200,5,357,3.9722222222222223
288231,4,6300268799,"I would considered Train Robbers to be one of John Wayne's underrated western movies he have made during his post True Grit era. While its not as good as some of his earlier ones, it probably the best one he made between True Grit and the Shootist (next to Rio Lobo). The Train Robbers seem to be a throw back to John Wayne's older westerns. The story developed slowly but with a purpose as the characters get ironed out. Ann-Margaret plays widow trying to restored family honor by getting the half million dollars worth of gold back to the train company from which her husband stole it from. John Wayne and his gang tries to helped but the usual bad guys, the late husband's gang gets into the way. Its an adventure all the way.

John Wayne does his usual entertaining self but he is superbly supported by Rod Taylor and especially Ben Johnson. It was also a pleasure to watch Christopher George as well before his illness took his life prematurely. Key element of any John Wayne movie was his interactions with his co-stars and they all blended in perfectly. The humor was good and some of the one liners proves to be classic. Ann-Margaret does quite well but she sounds little phoney from the beginning and that was bit of a give away as we reached to the end of the movie. At least for me, the ending didn't surprised me as much as it did for some people.

The movie weaknesses lies in the fact that John Wayne and his gang seem to be just too goody two shoes to be true. The bad guys were just props in the movie and their job was to get shot. They don't seem to be very smart bad guys either. Making banzai charges seem to be a trademark tactics to make the good guys victorious. Bobby Vinton and Jerry Gatlin were virtually wasted in their roles. In some ways, they seem to be no more then the bad guys although they don't get shot!

The DVD version of Train Robbers seem to be well presented. I owned a regular TV so I would say from that point that the picture is clear and the sound proves to be crisp on my Dolby system. The DVD movie come in its widescreen format. I have to admit that this was the first time I saw this movie in widescreen since 1973 when it first came out. There isn't much of a special features. One feature got several former stuntmen who worked with Wayne, singing their praises of him. Second feature is a promotional job for the movie. Then you got your trailers feature. That is just about it. Pretty slim pickings if you asked me.

Overall, a pretty entertaining and enjoyable film despite of its inherited flaws. I would give it a 3.5 stars if I had a choice. John Wayne fans should be highly please with this movie. It should please most western fans and might be mildly entertaining for causal viewers.",1115164800,29,2743,4.3515625
288232,3,6300268799,"Even though the Duke gets top billing and more screen time Annie's the real star of the film. Make no mistake. I admit she is incredibly sensual and interesting dressed mostly as a cowboy throughout the film. I am crazy about her. I also loved the performance of Rod Taylor in this film as the talkative, slightly buffoonish gang member. Ben Johnson is fine as the slower talking philosophical cowboy, good contrast to Rod. The Duke is meant here to be the link between these characters. Wayne is doing here what Clint Eastwood did in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, purposely being the somewhat uninteresting central character and letting the supporting characters shine (though when it came to Ann Margaret that was inevitable). The plot is wonderfully complex, reminiscient of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid in many ways (little seen pursuers and all). Hard to be exactly sure who the bad guys are and who the law is. To the poster who said that the supporting characters's past stories sound more interesting than the actual events well ok to you they do.",1114128000,2,1058,4.850828729281768
288233,4,6300268799,"I must say that I am taken aback by the many negative comments thrown at this film.  What many reviewers miss is the fact that, aside from being a Western, this is also a story in which the Duke plays opposite a strong woman.  There is the constant trading off between the two as to who has the upper hand--with the Duke not realizing that just when he thinks he has put Ann-Margaret in her place she has been deceiving him toward her own purposes all along.  Compared to the QUIET AMERICAN, MCLINTOCK, DONOVAN'S REEF, HATARI AND TRUE GRIT, this is one film where the Duke doesn't exactly carry the day over his female interest.  Therefore, it is quite refreshing in its own way.

Unlike other reviewers, I remember this film more fondly that I do others from the 1970's--including THE SHOOTEST.  In terms of a movie about cowboys for whom the times are passing by (and in Duke's terms in which Hollywood is leaving him behind), I prefer to remember the aging John Wayne this way.  Even outwitted by one hell of a woman, John Wayne had more dignity about himself than the pretenders who followed.  (Yes, I mean you, Kevin Costner.)",1112572800,13,1131,4.536945812807882
288234,2,6300268799,"...this movie is a dud. Who'd have thought that John Wayne and the director of ""Support Your Local Sherrif"" would have joined forces for this stinker!

The characterization hints at being good, but really its character actors doing what they do best - being good support characters. Its a good thing to because the Duke really just mailed this one  in.

First - what this movie does well:

-Ann Margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy.

-the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show.

-it is interesting that the bad guys chasing Ann Margaret and John Wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end. When you get to the end, you learn why, but it works well to keep them faceless.

-the last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending.

HOWEVER, what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right:

-John Wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a cardboard version of himself - a cranky, mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character - and when they do, it seems very, very clunky.

-At least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long-distance shots of people riding horses. Sometimes, they ride over hills, sometimes they ride through valleys. We get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the Rio Grande (the border with Mexico). Fill in this time with some character development! Some dialogue! Anything!

-the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie.

All in all, it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so John Wayne could have another movie in the theaters. Too bad, a crack team of writers could have made it something special.

My suggestion, get ""Cowboys"" or either of the two ""Rooster Cogburn"" movies or ""Support Your Local Sherrif"" and see this actor and this director doing much better work!",1099699200,12,1963,4.526912181303116

Cast:

John Wayne ... Lane

Ann-Margret ... Mrs. Lowe

Rod Taylor ... Grady

Ben Johnson ... Jesse

Christopher George ... Calhoun

Bobby Vinton ... Ben Young

Jerry Gatlin ... Sam Turner

Ricardo Montalban ... The Pinkerton man

A proud widow, Mrs. Lowe (Ann-Margret), hires a Civil War veteran, Lane (John Wayne), to recover the money her late husband stole from Wells Fargo in a train robbery.  With the assistance of his campatriots, Grady, Jesse, Calhoun, Ben Young and Sam Turner (Rod Taylor, Ben Johnson, Christopher George, Bobby Vinton and Jerry Gatlin, respectively), they set out for Mexico to find and recover the gold, of which only the widow, who is guiding them, knows the whereabouts.

That's the story, and the conflict comes in when her late husband's associates try to find the gold also.

This is a good John Wayne Western.  Not on a par with his best, perhaps, but very entertaining.

288236,4,6300268799,"The Train Robbers is a late film of the Duke's, but it is still an entertaining film.  Directed by Burt Kennedy, the story follows a widow who hires Wayne to escort her to a cache of hidden gold that belongs to her recently deceased husband.  Joining Wayne are a couple of old friends who come along.  There are not any identifiable bad guys except for a nameless group of gunman making their own go at the gold.  This is not a great John Wayne western, but it is not the worst.  Still very entertaining.

 What carries the movie is the excellent cast in support of John Wayne.  Joining him are Ann Margaret as the widow Mrs. Lowe, Rod Taylor, Ben Johnson, and even Ricardo Montalban in a small but funny role.  Taylor and Johnson are great together as Grady and Jesse, two old friends of Wayne's Lane.  There's a history among the three characters which provides plenty of laughs throughout the movie.  Also riding with Lane and Co. are Christopher George in a good supporting part as Calhoun, Bobby Vinton, and Jerry Gatlin.  And be sure to stick around till the end for Montalban's revelation at the end.  You won't be disappointed!

  The DVD offers some decent features, especially since many John Wayne DVDs are bare-bones.  Along with a beautiful widescreen presentation, the DVD has a trailer gallery of JW movies and two good featurettes, ""The Wayne Train"" made during the filming of the movie, and ""Working With a Hollywood Legend"" interviews with a great stuntman, Dean Smith, involving his work with Wayne.  This is a good western that deserves a watch if for nothing else than the twist at the end.  Very entertaining!",1053302400,65,1631,4.679577464788732

Awesome color, sparkling photography and very warm, engaging performance from Duke reminds why we miss him so much sometimes.

There's a bonus feature behind the scenes that I really enjoyed too, with reminisces by stunt men and cowboy actors on the film recalling the set construction and filming. The shootout action is at a pretty high level here, after a couple by-rote films from the Dukster. Couldn't ask for more.",1487116800,2,666,5.1192660550458715

288455,4,6300268799,"Released in 1973 and written & directed by Burt Kennedy, ""The Train Robbers"" stars John Wayne as Lane, a former Civil War officer who enlists a couple of his old subordinates (Ben Johnson & Rod Taylor) and a few younger gunfighters (e.g. Christopher George & Bobby Vinton) to help a widow (Ann-Margret) obtain a hidden cache of gold to honor her family's name. They travel 200 miles from West Texas into the Mexican desert while being chased by a gang who also wants the money, not to mention a mysterious man who has his own agenda (Ricardo Montalban).

While I relish this Western, it does have its flaws. The story is wholly contrived and contains a couple questionable dialogues, not to mention the ""yeah, right"" activities of the Montalban character. But I've seen way worse Westerns; the overrated ""The Searchers"" (1956) comes to mind.

If you like authentic breathtaking Southwestern vistas, notable Western music (reminiscent of ""How the West was Won""), a tried-and-true cast (including cutie Ann-Margret) and desert adventure marked by a long chase with numerous camping-out scenes (almost a survival movie), not to mention an exceptional centerpiece set, featuring a dilapidated abandoned train in the desert, and a quality surprise ending, you can't go wrong with ""The Train Robbers."" The magnificent Western cinematography is particularly notable: Myriad frames from practically every sequence could be used as awesome Western art. Then there's the fact that this is essentially a Western ""road movie,"" albeit without the road (you could call it a trail movie).

On top of this you get some dialogue exchanges that are nigh iconic for the Western genre. For instance, we've all seen those Westerns where the aging protagonist and a female half his age fall in love and ride off into the sunset, but there's a scene in ""The Train Robbers"" where the hot widow reveals her attraction to the aged-but-commanding Lane wherein he frankly informs her: ""I got a saddle that's older than you are, Mrs. Lowe."" This, of course, swiftly douses any romantic sparks.

Some criticize that the title is misleading, but it's applicable in three ways: (1.) Mr. Lowe robbed a train of $500,000 in gold before the movie begins, (2.) Lane & his team ""rob"" the abandoned train in the desert, and (3.) when the group decide to chase the train at the end one of them specifies that he's going to ""rob a train!""

As for the cavil that there's no central villain and that the gang chasing the protagonists are faceless gun-fodder, while this is true you have to respect the film for saying, ""Villain, villain? We don't need no stinking villain."" Besides, there IS a villain in the predominant cast. A conman IS a villain, albeit with a smile and charm. The ending reveals all and those who complain about the lack of a key antagonist are doofuses who can't see the forest for the trees.

For those who scratch their heads at various elements of the plot, just connect the dots from the various dialogues and it makes sense. It's all there.

I admit that ""The Train Robbers"" is palpably flawed for the reasons cited earlier. If the filmmakers would've just taken a little more time and spent a little more money to work out the kinks it could've been a latter-day Wayne Western on the level of ""True Grit"" (1969), ""The Cowboys"" (1972) and ""Rooster Cogburn"" (1975). Still, its highlights make it not far off; it's an entertaining cult Western.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Durango, Sonora & Chihuahua, Mexico; and Yuma, Arizona.

Otherwise, very little chatter; only the occasional gunfights and explosions to distinguish this routine road picture.  Even though top billed, Rod Taylor is given precious little to do.

her husband had told her of it's location before he died, she is the only one that knows where it had been hidden.
She says her husband had taken part in a train robbery some years ago, he and two others had hidden the gold, but
only he had returned.
'Lane' has two comrades from the civil war waiting for him in 'Liberty' Texas, 'Grady' (Rod Taylor) and 'Jesse' (Ben Johnson)
along with three others they'd roped in for the job, their reward would be a share of $50,000 if successful
The seven set out from 'Liberty' to recover the gold, trouble is, there were 7 others involved in the train-robbery that have a
vested interest in collecting their share, they ride with 13 gunman and are following, it's a 5-day ride.
But, who is the lone rider played by 'Ricardo Montalban' who is never very far away on the trail ?
'Lane' and his  are in for a fight if they are to get 'Mrs Lowe' and the gold safely back to civilisation, the odds are against them
will they all live long enough to enjoy the rewards ?
Must admit, i thought i'd seen all the 'John Wayne' westerns filmed in colour....this is the first time i've seen this one, noticed
it on the Amazon U.S site, this the first time the film has become available on the Blu-ray format.
This is an enjoyable 'John Wayne' western that includes several fire-fight sequences, well worth a viewing......
Though a little grainy at times the picture quality is pretty good overall.
Also among the cast, Pop-Star 'Bobby Vinton' as 'Ben Young'  and  'Christopher George' as 'Calhoun'

288737,1,6300268799,"The Train Robbers, 1972 film

It starts in a desert land, the sign says Liberty Texas. [Why the state name?] There is a single railroad line, the wind blows dust in this sparsely populated land. Three men ride up for a meeting. A man and a woman detrain. They plan to get a lot of gold already dug. We hear of the plan. It is legal. A mule provides action before they travel south and cross the Big River. Later another train arrives with about twenty mounted men, who follow the first group. The talk tells of their character. A mule goes missing in the night! They find that mule in town. There is a storm at night, lightning and thunder. A tree falls, a horse is rescued. [Padding to fill out the story.]

The larger second group pursues the first, hours behind. Mrs. Lowe is rescued. They see their pursuers. They find the old railroad in the wind-blown desert. That second group fires at them and misses. Later they find a wrecked steam engine and inspect it. They await their pursuers and talk. Dont get old. Shooting begins as the second group approaches, they are driven back. They must guard their horses at night. There is shooting at night, the second group leaves. An explosion drives their horses away. In the morning they discuss plans. They ride away and arrive at a town at night, then continue on. [Their horses never tire? You don't see extra food and water either.]

They stop to rest and discuss their pursuers. Where are they? They return to the place where they started from. They are ambushed by that gang. Shooting begins, men fall. That midnight train arrives. Dynamite is thrown at the buildings to create action! They arrive at another stop to meet a train. Mrs. Lowe enters the coach, her team refuses to accept their share of the reward. [Believable? Done for a happy ending?] Then a Pinkerton man tells them something they didn't know about Lilly. This inspires them to take action! [For an ironic ending.]

This movie must be the worst to feature John Wayne. Was it due to his declining health? The extra features on the DVD show movie trailers Tall in the Saddle (from a Saturday Evening Post story and Fort Apache. Both seem livelier and more entertaining than TTR. So too the other movies.

288784,4,6300268799,"This is a fair late John Wayne entry. Blu-ray presentation is great. Picture and color is fine as is sound. Give it an A for presentation as source was either fine or reworked to make it such. The cinematography is outstanding with many iconic images of our hero and his band on horseback riding through interesting terrain. It's the forgoing that gives it it's fourth star. The problem is the story itself which, which in my view rates probably only three stars, as it is simplistic/minimalistic to an extreme and the confrontation with the bad guys unconvincing. It's been said the stature of a hero is judged by the intelligence and/or force of his enemy and while great in number here, the largely faceless enemy is pretty dumb in their execution of any plan to prevail, over our band of good guys. Our stature of our hero isn't raised much by dealing with  this hoard of bad guys seemingly without a discernible leader, and the conclusive final skirmish is reminiscent of the endings in Rio Bravo and the Sons of Katie Elder. There is a bit of a twist at the very end which has been elsewhere discussed which changes the character of the entire story up to that point, which neither greatly adds nor detracts much to what's gone before. It's an OK western in the John Wayne tradition, but pretty light weight in it's totality.",1433721600,2,1331,4.616033755274262

The cast is strong and includes Ann-Margret, Rod Taylor, Ben Johnson, Christopher George, Bobby Vinton and Ricardo Montalban. William H. Clothier cinematography adds a lot to this Western giving it just the right feel with beautiful landscapes and vistas. I love the train they have come to rob as its suggested in the title. It is a forgotten ghostly train that is half buried in the desert sand. There is something symbolic in it all.

289092,3,6300268799,"Despite its low reputation, Burt Kennedy's The Train Robbers has quite a bit going for it even if the end result is a pretty average oater best seen in a double-bill with a better film. John Wayne and old friends Rod Taylor and Ben Johnson (who, true to the formula in later Wayne pictures, handles all the dialogue filling in the Duke's backstory to make sure the audience knows what a great guy he is behind the bluster) team up to help widow Ann-Margret find the quarter of a million in gold her late husband stole so she can turn it in for the reward with a clear conscience. Naturally hubby's former partners in crime and a few more anonymous bad `uns they've recruited in the intervening years have plans of their own and are in hot pursuit.

For the two-thirds the plot can roughly be summed up as: Wayne and company ride at a leisurely pace while a band of band men gallop after them without catching up for the best part of an hour of screentime while Ricardo Montalban's silent stranger watches from a distance while smoking a cigar. Thankfully there's some good dialogue along the way that has fun playing with Wayne's many catchphrases while acknowledging the Duke is too old to play the romantic lead (""I've got a saddle older than you, Mrs Lowe""). Along the way we learn that Rod Taylor can't master an American accent, Ann Margret can't play drunk, Dominic Frontiere's busy score can't really get a grip on the film and can surmise that Bobby Vinton managed to annoy someone high up on the film from the way he's literally pretty much sidelined throughout the film - because he's often placed at the extreme edge of the frame and rarely does anything, he was almost completely cut out of Warner Home Video's old fullframe video transfer.

The action's decent when it comes in the last half hour and the wrecked train set among the desert sand dunes is a particularly memorable location, but its greatest asset is William Clothier's superb scope photography which ensures it's certainly one of the best looking Westerns of the 70s - the opening sequence of Ben Johnson waiting in a ghost town for a train amid swirling dust may not have the payoff of Once Upon a Time in the West, but it's a great scene setter the film doesn't have much chance of living up to. Still, as Taylor says, ""It's something to do"" even if it is more two-and-a-half stars than three.

Warner Home Video's US NTSC DVD has a fine 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with a few decent extras - a vintage making of featurette, a newer featurette on working with Wayne, original theatrical trailer and trailers for Tall in the Saddle, Fort Apache, Blood Alley, The Sea Chase, Cahill - U.S. Marshal and McQ.",1374796800,,2682,4.583333333333333

289094,4,6300268799,"To say things straight, this film is not a full success - but I do not regret that I bought and watched it. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Some twenty years after the War Between The States, a certain Ms. Lowe (gorgeous Ann-Margret), a young and very attractive widow, contacts Lane (John Wayne), an aging former Union cavalry officer, to help her with an unusual endeavour. Ms. Lowe reveals that her late husband was, sadly, a bandit and he once attacked a government train and stole half a million USD in gold coins! It seems that this loot was essentialy not spend but hidden, in a particularly remote and unfriendly location in northern Mexico - and Ms. Lowe knows precisely where! She wants to get this gold and return it - and she is ready to share with Lane and his men the finder fee (10%) offered by the US government. But she warns Lane, that she is not the only one to be after the gold - former associates of her husband are relentlessly following her and if finding this gold offers no difficulties, surviving to claim the reward can be a different matter altogether...

What follows is an easy, mostly relaxing, rather pleasant to watch western, not very good but not very bad either, with a big voyage, lots of camping, black coffee and beef jerky with beans meals, occasional gun fights, some campfires stories and a John Wayne who willingly concedes that both his character and himself are getting old and romancing beautiful young widows is a little behind both of them (""I have a saddle older than you Ms. Lowe""). Once we arrive to the northern Mexico desert, some pretty original elements borrowed from both ""new wave"" and ""spaghetti"" westerns show that this film was clearly made in 1973, a time very different from the one in which John Wayne was the greatest star in Hollywood. As most of Lane's men are his old comrades in arms from times of Civil War, this film is also quite nostalgic... Also, dialogs are honest, with an occasional good one-liner.

Amongst the weak elements in this film are the ""bad guys"" - sorry for the SPOILER here, but you should not expect much from them - there is nothing interesting about them and they are really perfectly expendable pathetic gun fodder...

As it was already stated, this is a relaxing and not very original watch - but things change radically in the last 5 minutes... I will certainly not reveal anything about those last 5 minutes, but believe me, even if by moments you can think that this film is too slow and sometimes disappointing, it is still worth to wait until the end, because there you may have both a big surprise (I did not see it coming at all) and a HUGE laugh...)))

Bottom line, this is a kind of 3,5 stars film, recommended mostly for the most devoted Duke's fans or western maniacs (I plead guilty on both counts), who are ready to go to great lenghts just to hear John Wayne say ""If anyone tries to cross that river before we're out of sight- baptize'em"". Other viewers may be somehow disappointed. But me, I am still glad that I discovered this little known film.",1373241600,,3077,4.567028985507246

This one centers around Ann Margret hiring Wayne and a group of other hired guns to recover a large amount of money her late husband hid from a train robbery.

The movie moves along at a good pace and has Wayne and his  group riding out to search for the money.  What they do not know at the time is that another group of bad guys are also on the hunt for the same money.  Like most westerns this one has some good drama, action and shoot-outs.

In conclusion, if you are a John Wayne fan you will probably also enjoy watching this DVD.

289179,4,6300268799,"The 1973 film ""The Train Robbers"" is arguably John Wayne's greatest twilight western, a superbly produced package with great casting, a crackerjack story and one of Dominic Frontiere's most underrated musical scores. I love this movie and with each repeated viewing never wince. There's no maudlin Billy the Kid ballads, no major roles miscast with non-actors, and even a respectable nod towards character development and motivation. ""The Train Robbers"" is well-crafted, ultimately playing out as a clean tribute to veteran soldiers riding the trail for perhaps the final time.

Wayne made so many films with such unusual consistency. It's difficult to downgrade his work because even when the script and direction were poor, there was his presence, an enormous icon with unparalleled likability. When discussing his beloved ""twilight westerns,"" roughly the mid-1960s to the end of his career, fans become incensed if you remotely critique them. Here's the rub. Starting with ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" and marching to his famous swan song&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shootist/dp/B00005JSGL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shootist</a>, the majority of those films were average at best. With the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Dorado/dp/6305754969/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Dorado</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000O179FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, most of his films during this span were not very good. I have always thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cowboys/dp/B000NUYJW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cowboys</a>&nbsp;could have been a true classic if not for its radically uneven story, abruptly shifting gears when Bruce Dern strolls to the campfire.

Sadly, the ""The Train Robbers"" was not profitable at the theater. Combined with the middling follow-up ""Cahill: U.S. Marshall,"" Wayne was forced to make the late-career choice to stride into the modern-day roles of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McQ/dp/B000O599YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McQ</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brannigan/dp/B000127MAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brannigan</a>. When viewed today, it's surprisingly apparent ""The Train Robbers"" is one of the 2-3 best films Wayne made during his final years. There's credit to spare, but much of the quality is due to the sturdy hand of writer/director Burt Kennedy. He began his career writing screenplays for Budd Boetticher's cult westerns (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Films-of-Budd-Boetticher-Tall-T-Decision-at-Sundown-Buchanan-Rides-Alone-Ride-Lonesome-Comanche-Station/dp/B001ER4CNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Films of Budd Boetticher (Tall T / Decision at Sundown / Buchanan Rides Alone / Ride Lonesome / Comanche Station)</a>). From there he graduated to directing such decent works as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rounders/dp/B003552QX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rounders</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Support-Your-Local-Sheriff/dp/B000056H2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Support Your Local Sheriff</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannie-Caulder/dp/B003J216KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannie Caulder</a>. He was a no-nonsense talent and a perfect fit for Wayne (though they had previously worked together on the average ""The War Wagon"").

The adventure tale begins in a ghost town. Wayne, as former Civil War leader Lane, has recruited surviving members of his troop for a dangerous mission on the Texas border. He steps off the train with a beautiful widow (Ann-Margret) whose late husband was a train robber. They're headed to Mexico to dig up lost gold from a big score and return the loot to authorities to clear her family's name. En route, they're tracked by a huge posse with their own aspirations for the buried riches. It's a fun journey emboldened by the perfect casting of Rod Taylor and Ben Johnson as Wayne's former comrades. There's even the dependable Christopher George as a young gun learning the ropes about loyalty and fear under pressure.

Like many of Wayne's final westerns, ""The Train Robbers"" was filmed in Durango, Mexico, a picturesque locale with rugged mountains, dusty roads and a few desert dunes. To this day local residents recall his presence, ""He was a very big man who spoke bad Spanish."" One of the highlights of this film is the unforgettable use of locations as the salty crew rides across rivers and eventually along an abandoned railroad line during a sand storm. This is a uniquely beautiful western with creative detail down to the clothes of the actors. The entire film has an artistic grittiness setting it apart from other Wayne westerns of this era.

There's also a much-discussed twist ending that will catch you by surprise, but it fits the mold of this film that goes against the preachy pulpit tradition of many twilight westerns. It's a tribute to a genre, but it's also an unassuming adventure that never unravels. It holds together like a sturdy, well-made engine, chugging along as smooth as your father's truck.",1351728000,7,5513,6.972503617945007
289180,4,6300268799,"The thing I noticed most about the film was that it was such an empty world. They didn't even try to populate the towns or fill out the story setting. I liked the story idea because it was unique and interesting, but the director simply set up shots and covered script without actually building a world. This is somewhat like the low grade horse operas of the twenties and thirties. Hoot Gibson made westerns in five days (dozens of them) that had more substance to the actual film setting. The director (and he has made some really great films) violated the first rule of film making... 'show, don't tell'. The actors were talking heads. This would have been better as an audio play on radio. There was little 'film' in this film, just talk and sound effects. Poor Ann Margaret was working only a few months after a devastating accident wherein her face was crushed. It would take several more years of surgery to get her back to even near what she had been before. Wayne himself was dieing right before our eyes. For all it's flaws, the acting was some of the best of any of the John Wayne movies made after 1968 and the actors gave it a good go for what they had to work with. It was low budget and shot quickly. The editors either had little to work with or else just didn't care. I think it was the former. It was a slap dash movie made for little money and thrown out to the public simply because of the reputation of the actors involved. Too bad. It had a lot of potential.",1349654400,,1480,4.327338129496403

289222,4,6300268799,"THE TRAIN ROBBERS (1973) is a late-career John Wayne western with a fairly simple plot: young widow Ann-Margret hires gunslinger Wayne and crew to help retrieve a chest of gold from a train wreck, loot that was stolen by her husband, so she can return the $500K to its rightful owners. Only the lady knows the location of the train, and she insists on tagging along. Also following close behind is a gang of 40 well-ironed thieves. There's attacks, an explosion to stampede horses, and other such action in this fan-pleasing JW western.

That said, a too-close look and the plot falls apart. A half-million in gold in those days would've weighed nearly a ton, yet we see a lone man pushing the chest around and just one mule carrying it.

We will not give pause to those customers who complain about some Western movie as ""too slow"", ""not having enough action"", or ""too boring""!

The Wild West was in fact, where LIFE WAS SLOW!

Get over it.

The much admired cowboys, gunfighters, ranchers, farmers, and colorful cast of real-life characters, did NOT live during the age of the internet, thank God.

We have much to learn from them. They were patient people by today's standards, all of them. They sat on their horses and waited for the next stagecoach passing (highwaymen); they labored long, hard hours in the heat of the day! (without making a run to the nearest MacDonalds to quench their lusty appetites).

This most wonderful WESTERN, THE TRAIN ROBBERS, places the ""viewer"" (that means YOU) back into that time, when time itself almost STOOD STILL. The movie opens with the wind blowing across the desert range; gunfighters are awaiting the next train that seems to never arrive (it does!).

You can feel the heat, the blinding sun in your eyes, and taste the blowing dust in your mouth!

Why chase after movies that only gaurantee action every second, to appease your too-short attention span?

If you want to know what the West was all about, you will PURCHASE THE TRAIN ROBBERS WITHOUT DELAY!!!

John Wayne is still at his best here -- and so is Ben Johnson (remember Chris Calloway in SHANE??) - another CLASSIC WESTERN GEM!!! Bravo, Hollywood -- you did it again! We owe you a big thankyou for bringing the old wild west back to life again and again and again!!!!",1307750400,5,1566,4.745387453874539
289224,5,6300268799,"I enjoyed The Train Robbers much more than I expected to after reading some of the negative reviews.  One reason is a small detail that I haven't seen anyone mention in any of the reviews, and that's the nostalgic effect of the main characters' names.  John Wayne plays Lane, while Ann Margaret plays Mrs. Lowe; coincidentally, the exact same character names as in Hondo.  It was a blast from the past to hear Wayne saying ""Mrs. Lowe"" throughout the movie, and when you add in that she is a self-purported widow and that Wayne's character shares the surname of Hondo Lane, you end up with a not-so-subtle homage to one of the classics.  I thought it was a nice touch.

The Train Robbers shouldn't be judged in the same way as The Searchers, The Cowboys, True Grit, or some of the other widely acknowledged classics because it's not the same type of movie.  Those films have a more serious tone and tackle more weighty issues; The Train Robbers is meant to be a fun action movie, and I think it succeeds.

I was entertained by the camaraderie among the characters and how their back-stories tied in, kept interested by the treasure-hunt nature of the plot, and left satisfied by the abundant action and beautiful photography.  To me, the criteria for judging a mostly light-toned action movie should be different than for a dramatic piece like The Searchers or True Grit.  I had fun watching it and grew to strongly like the characters, which I think are the most important qualities for a movie of this type.

My last word on The Train Robbers is that I think a great majority of the acting was top-notch.  Wayne plays the grizzled but good-natured leader perfectly, and Ben Johnson aces the dependable, loyal comrade much as he does in Chisum.  I also thought Ann Margaret's performance was surprisingly strong.  Overall, I can't really find anything to complain about, and I'm sure that if you like other Wayne westerns from the 70's, you'll like this one.",1303776000,3,1958,4.690058479532164

289270,3,6300268799,"John Wayne, Ben Johnson, and a few of his friends are in search of stolen gold.  A beautiful young widow (played by Ann-Margaret) wants to recover a chest of gold that her husband stole from a train.  He hid the gold as he was being pursued, then died in a bordello before he could recover it.  His widow has a son and she wants to recover the gold and return it to its rightful owners to clear her husband's name.  So she gets John Wayne and a few of his friends to ride down to Mexico with her to recover the gold for a share of the reward money.  Of course, there are a few others would like to get their hands on the gold as well, and that is where things get interesting.

This is a decent, not outstanding, John Wayne western.  Probably one of the better movies that Wayne made near the end of his career, but if you compared it to all his films, not more than a middlin' work.  The story has several significant weaknesses.  The bad guys are just a bunch of nameless, faceless goons whose only role is to ride in a big pack, chase the heros around, then die en masse at the appropriate time (kind of like the red shirts in Star Trek!).  The first appearance of the bad guys is when a train pulls up and about 20 of them literally disembark by having their horses jump off flat bed cars with the riders in the saddle.  Second, at this point in their careers, John Wayne and his cohorts are so old that they could be Ann-Margaret's grandparents.  The little bit of `love interest' there is in this story isn't really believable.  Finally, the story isn't all that compelling or believable and, excluding a good (and unexpected, at least by me) twist at the end, is very formulaic.

Bottom line is that this is one of the many now largely forgotten but decent Westerns that is worth a watch as a rental or on a rainy Tuesday night on the Western Channel, but nothing that I would spend money on unless I was a huge John Wayne fan.  3.5 stars for a serious JW fan, 3.0 stars for the rest of more general fans of Westerns.",1267056000,,2024,4.220779220779221
289271,4,6300268799,"There are many ways to cheer yourself up when one is down in the dumps.  I have found that one of the things I like to do is put on a good John Wayne western.  To those of us who idolized the Duke, his western films and his real-life patriotism and love of country, made many of us feel better about America.  It is perhaps the reason why this man is still idolized despite being deceased over 30 years.  And considering the events currently taking place in our country with the current people we have in power, boy do we need him now.
""The Train Robbers"" is not Waynes best western, it is no ""Searchers,"" no ""Hondo,"" no ""Rio Bravo"" or ""El Dorado"" and no ""Shootist.""  It is simply an enjoyable western with some good action, beautiful scenery and a great supporting cast.  Co-starring with the Duke is Ann-Margret as the woman who hires Wayne and his group of cohorts to recover some gold stolen by her deceased husband.  One forgets how absolutely beautiful Ann-Margret was until one sees her in her prime.  (I had the pleasure of briefly meeting her recently and mentioned to her that she co-starred with 2 of my favorites: Wayne in ""The Train Robbers"" and Elvis in ""Viva Las Vegas.""  She seemed pleased and said ""Bless their hearts."")  Also co-starring is the great Rod Taylor, an actor I greatly admired from 2 of the favorite films of my childhood: Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and George Pal's ""The Time Machine.""  (See Taylor currently in ""Inglourious Basterds.""  Apparently Tarentino idolized him as well.)  The film also co-stars the terrific Ben Johnson, a man seemingly incapable of giving a bad performance.  Ricardo Montalban is also good as a mysterious stranger following the group.
For a Warner Bros. DVD, this disc shockingly has a couple special features: a nice little featurette featuring the stuntmen who worked on this film reminiscing about working with Wayne on this film, a vintage featurette on the production of this film and trailers of other Wayne films on Warner Bros. DVDs.  The picture and sound quality of this disc are very good.
As stated, if you want to sit back and relax with an enjoyable Wayne western, this is for you.  It is no ""Rio Bravo,"" (my favorite Wayne western,) but then again, what is?",1263686400,,2230,4.67948717948718
289272,4,6300268799,"I had not really heard of the Train Robbers, but added it to my Netflix cue since I enjoy most John Wayne westerns. This film came late in the Duke's career, and is not a classic, but definitely entertaining. The plot is pretty simple to follow, the action moves along at a nice pace, and the surprise ending is actually pretty funny. Overall, it contains a lot of the right ingredients for a solid Western movie. Several other reviewers have covered the details, so I will not here. Just two quick thoughts:

First, Ann Margaret does a nice job in her role. Completely believable as the widow, she matches up well with the Duke in his role. Second, there is actually some good humor in this movie. I watched it with my boys and they loved the line ""something to do"".

If you enjoy John Wayne Westerns, then you will enjoy this movie. Some parts of it are a little goofy, but solid entertainment. If you are looking for a classic Wayne film, then start elsewhere.",1254614400,,963,4.465909090909091
289273,3,6300268799,"Mrs. Lowe (Ann Margret) is the widow who enlists the help of Lane (John Wayne) in finding a gold shipment that had been stolen five years ago...

In that time ten men rode away with half a million in gold... The fellow that was running the show figured they better hide it until things cooled off... So he took the Fargo box and rode south into Mexico... He had the misfortune of getting shot... But before he died, he told his wife--the mother of his little boy-- where the gold was...

289275,3,6300268799,"John Wayne and voluptuous Ann-Margret co-star in writer & director Burt Kennedy's ""The Train Robbers,"" a traditional but rambunctious western shoot'em up about a notorious outlaw's widow who hires the Duke to recover a half-a-million in stolen gold from her husband's last robbery five years old. She wants the money returned to Wells Fargo so she clear her husband's name as well as keep her young son from growing up thinking that his father went around robbing trains. Wayne summons his trusty old saddle pals Rod Taylor, Ben Johnson and Bobby Vinton to accompany him on this perilous journey. Taylor brings along a couple of young gunmen, Christopher George and Jerry Gatlin, to find the buried treasure. No sooner has Wayne, Ann-Margret, and company saddled up and crossed the border into Mexico to find the fortune in gold than a train load of gunslingers show up and pursue them. Meanwhile, lurking on the fringes of the action is a mysterious but elegantly-attired, cigar-smoking hombre who never loses sight of them.  He turns out to be a pretty fair shot with a Winchester rifle.

Our heroes meet at an isolated railway station in Liberty, Texas, rather like the one in Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" The small town appears empty. The wind gusts across the boardwalk at the hotel and sways the rocking chairs back and forth. A metal sign buckles in the breeze. Jesse (Ben Johnson of ""Rio Grande"") awaits the arrival of Lane (John Wayne) on a train that was due in the day before, and everybody is astonished when Mrs. Lowe (Ann-Margret of ""Viva Las Vegas"") gets off the train with Lane. Jesse and Grady (Rod Taylor of ""Dark of the Sun"") remember Lane as ""bull-headed"" and they discover to their relief that he hasn't changed an iota. Later, we learn that Jesse and Grady served together under Lane in the Union Army during the American Civil War where they endured their baptism under fire at Vicksburg. Life for these three has been going up one hill of adversity after another. Feisty Calhoun stands up to Lane, and Lane wallops Grady. Grady thinks that Lane ought to be happy that Calhoun stood up to him. Conversely, Lane wants men who will stand alongside him not against him. Calhoun demands to know what they are getting themselves into, and Lane observes that they are doing what any hired gun does . . . risking their lives. Earlier, before Lane and Mrs. Lowe got off the train, Grady told Jesse that he has shown up for the job simply because it amounted to ""something to do.""

After initial misgivings about endangering a woman on a long ride through the desert, Lane and company head out. Before they leave the station, Lane has Mrs. Lowe's shirt boiled so that she will stand out and her late husband's pallbearers won't mistake her as a man and try to shoot her. An army of gunmen--we never see these guys up close--shadow our heroes across the parched terrain to the accompaniment of ""Rat Patrol"" composer Dominic Frontiere's giddy-up score that signals the change of locale when everybody plunges across the Rio Grande into old Mexico. Along the way, during several campfire scenes we learn more about our heroes. Eventually, the feuding between Calhoun and Lane ends and they become friends. Finally, our heroes find the railroad train in the middle of the Mexican desert. They dig into the boiler and find the gold, but they aren't about to go anywhere because that ubiquitous army of gunmen that has been trailing them arrives. As our heroes fortify themselves for the ensuing gun battle, Jesse and Grady swap memorable but pithy dialogue. ""Don't get old,"" Grady warns Jesse, ""you'll live to regret it."" The twenty gunmen attack them, but our heroes emerge unscathed largely because--in Lane's words--""they could shoot worth a damn.""

Our heroes head back across the border, but the remaining gunmen beat them back to Liberty and prepare a reception for them. Everything ends with a bang-up shoot-out at the railway station where Lane met Jesse and Calhoun. Our heroes virtually blow the town to bits with dynamite so they can defeat the villains. During this fracas, Mrs. Lowe pulls a fast one on our heroes in what constitutes an O'Henry reversal. The well-dressed stranger (Ricardo Montalban of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"") turns out to be a Pinkerton detective who has been on Mrs. Lowe for five years. He explains that she was never married and that Lowe died with a bullet in the back in the bordello where Mrs. Lowe worked. She reveals that Mrs. Lowe's name is Lily. Our heroes scramble after the departing train that carries the pseudo Mrs. Lowe and the gold.

Burt Kennedy got his start writing laconic but entertaining oaters for director Budd Boetticher in the 1950s. Wayne's film production company Batjac produced many of Boetticher's existential westerns so it is no surprise that Kennedy went on to pen westerns for Wayne. The first collaboration between Wayne and Kennedy was the superlative ""The War Wagon."" Mind you, ""The Train Robbers"" isn't half as exhilarating as ""The War Wagon,"" but this nifty little sagebrusher never runs out of steam and the dialogue is fun to hear. Rod Taylor is nothing short of brilliant as Wayne and Johnson's friend. Okay, all the characters are pretty much stereotypical and of them gets so much as a scratch. Wayne plays his usual stalwart hero and leathery Ben Johnson is his wise sidekick. Naturally, Ann-Margret is a feast for the eyes. The scene where Wayne tries to get her drunk so she will reveal the whereabouts of the gold  is amusing. Later, when she comes onto Wayne, he deflects her amorous advances with the line, ""M'am, I've got a saddle older than you.""

Although it is painfully predictable from fade-in to fade-out, ""The Train Robbers"" is a rip-snorting adventure that benefits immeasurably from veteran Wayne lenser William H. Clothier's gorgeous widescreen photography. Veteran stunt & wrangler Cliff Lyons orchestrates the hard-riding horsemen scenes. Special photographic effects veteran Albert Whitlock does some nice things with his hand-painted visuals. Check out the long shot where our heroes appear to be riding near a river with a waterfall.  No, ""The Train Robbers"" is not ""The Searchers"" or ""El Dorado,"" but John Wayne fans will enjoy this familiar but engaging western.",1226361600,,6298,4.879439252336448

289278,4,6300268799,"The Train Robbers is one of those straightforward old-fashioned good guy vs bad guy westerns.  A movie with a basic plot that doesn't take itself too seriously.  What is noticeable right off is that there are very few actors in this movie, eight, and everything revolves around their relationships. There is the straight shooting Lane (John Wayne) who gathers his old friends Grady (Rod Taylor) and Jesse (Ben Johnson) to restore Mrs. Lowe's (Ann-Margret) honor. She doesn't want her son growing up under the dark cloud of his dead father being a train robber.  Rounding out the team is Ben (Bobby Vinton), Sam (Jerry Gatlin), and Calhoun (Christopher George).  Their job is ride into Mexico, recover $500,000 in stolen gold locked in the boiler of an old locomotive, return it to Wells Fargo, collect the reward money, and set things right for Mrs. Lowe.  Trailing along behind them all is a mysterious rider (Ricardo Montalban).  The remaining movie's cast are just back ground minglers in the set.  They  mainly consist of the train engineer, the bartender, the Mexicans trying to rescue their jailed friends, and the cannon fodder bad guys. They are seen but have no speaking roles.

This is a very simple movie in many ways.  However, it does a very good job in developing the friendship and camaraderie between good old friends.  This combined with beautiful scenic shots and set pieces make for a  light-hearted fare with no dark undertones or jarring side trips.  Rounded out  with comedy and action, this movie certainly demonstrates that less is more.

While not the best western that John Wayne has starred in, this movie does succeeds in many ways.  Formated in wide-screen with few extras on the DVD, this western is well worth adding to the John Wayne collection",1183420800,,1776,4.909395973154362
