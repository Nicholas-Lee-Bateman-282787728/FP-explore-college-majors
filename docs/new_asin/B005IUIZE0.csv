8475059,4,B005IUIZE0,"The fights are awesome in BluRay and I like skipping through all the hoopala soem time and just watching some of these professional fighters do what they do best. I quit watching boxing many years ago due to all the corruption involved. UFC fighting is real and WAY better than the usual ""boxing"" where the promoters and people behind the scenes control who wins. Thanks, Jim McDaniel",1357084800,,384,4.746268656716418

8475063,5,B005IUIZE0,"Unlike former ultimate knockouts this one contains some extras.  During the main feature they insert interviews with fighters talking about what was the greatest KO of all time, who is the greatest KO artist of all time, the best strategy to get a KO, etc.  Also, there is a Total TKO bonus feature with 15 or so TKO's.

I guess there is still some room for improvement but this is way better than some of the previous installments that show the KO's and nothing else.",1320796800,3,468,4.482352941176471
