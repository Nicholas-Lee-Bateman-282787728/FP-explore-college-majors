8507373,5,B006ZZ6MGU,"If you had piano lessons from ""Mrs Berta"" as a child, you probably experienced the typical unenlightened approach to learning piano. You also probably hated to practice ""reading"" music and never learned to ""make"" music. You may even have given up playing piano in frustration. But Scott Houston's approach will make the scales fall from your eyes (pun intended). Learn to use the ""Fake Book"" or Lead Sheet approach to make it much easier and much more fun to play piano. Select a song you like and learn to play it right away is Scott's answer to making you enjoy learning piano. He has several popular songs which are on DVD's dedicated just to learning that one song. The secret is to learn just the few chords you need for the left hand while you play the melody with the right. Suggest you start with Scott's ""learn to play piano in a flash"" DVD before you start with a ""one-on-one"" DVD. You will not be disappointed. Excellent!",1382745600,,932,4.586826347305389
8507374,5,B006ZZ6MGU,"IMAGINE - An unforgettable tune. Rolling Stones has listed ""IMAGINE""
as the 3rd all time best song.  I am a senior citizen (age 71),
love hearing this tune over and over again and just beginning to play the piano.
IMAGINE will be my beginner's challenge but according to Scott it is
an excellent choice for a beginner.  Written in the key of C,
tons of white notes, 8 simple chords and only 1 black note in the E7 chord.

The overall goal of this DVD is to learn the song and have fun
doing it.  It may take you a  week, a month or several months but do it at your pace.
Scott will tell you that your are not playing for perfection but for
your own enjoyment. Make it your tune, your style, your enjoyment and above all
stress free. Through out the lessons Scott will present what he calls
""nuggets"" (tips and tricks) that will make your playing easier or
the tune sounding better.
