8552323,5,B001QSUYCO,"We've been in the horse business for many, many years.  When I first saw this documentary, which was funded by the Ford Foundation, I came to appreciate more the cowboys that I had the privilege of dealing with in rodeo, team roping, quarter horse sales and ranching. Living in South Texas,  my earliest recollection was Jacinto Gutierrez, camp cook for the Henry Ranch.  Then there was Cuate Bautista, Don Silvino Ramos, and more, many  more legendary vaqueros. I totally agree with the  statement made in the video  that the vaqueros' foot prints are all over South Texas but the only ones that appreciate them are the ones that knew them.  Thank you.
