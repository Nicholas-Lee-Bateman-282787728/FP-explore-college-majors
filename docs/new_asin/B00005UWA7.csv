1668887,5,B00005UWA7,"This is a wonderful western. John Payne is perfect for his part. It is an exciting film, and the beautiful Rhonda Fleming is just breath taking. Ronald Reagan as always in control and thorough. I give this film five stars. I will purchase more of the old west films in the near future. I know that the music score is important to the films dramatization, but you sometimes wonder from behind which tree or rock the orchestra is hiding. Even so, ""Nothin like a good western""!",1316649600,,474,4.523255813953488
1668888,5,B00005UWA7,"During his years as an actor, former President Ronald Reagan made no secret of the fact that he enjoyed playing in Westerns.  None of the oaters he made ever achieved the status of a SHANE or HIGH NOON, but on a strictly visceral level, all were entertaining.

One of his better Westerns was TENNESSEE'S PARTNER (1955), directed by Allan Dwan, which has now been re-released onto DVD in a widescreen edition by VCI Entertainment.  A good script, adapted from a story by Bret Harte, enhances it.

Reagan plays a square-shooting cowboy who befriends shifty gambler John Payne, then gets romantically involved with the equally devious Coleen Gray.  Rhonda Fleming co-stars as the owner of a gambling establishment and Anthony Caruso, of course, is the film's lead heavy.

1668889,4,B00005UWA7,"RKO Radio Pictures  presents ""TENNESSEE'S PARTNER"" (1955) (87 min/Color/Widescreen) -- Starring John Payne, Ronald Reagan, Rhonda Fleming, Coleen Gray, Anthony Caruso, Morris Ankrum, Leo Gordon, Chubby Johnson, Joe Devlin, Frank Jenks & Myron Healey

Directed by Allan Dwan

RKO Radio Pictures was a studio to be reckoned with during the last of the Golden Era of good film making.  The plot of this film is weak and there are few surprises. Payne plays an unusual non hero character for a change, Reagan is good as the Cowpoke, Fleming as ""Duchess is gorgeous as always and Coleen Gray who's name Goldie implies what she's really after

Wonderful cast though, which include Morris Ankrum as the Judge, Myron Healey as a hired gun, Anthony Caruso as the gambler with a bad case of jealousy, Joe Devlin as Caruso's assistant, Frank Jenks as the bartender and if you pay attention you'll see Angie Dickinson as one of the Duchess' girls. Veteran bad man Pierce Lydon also has a bit as one of the miners.

Special footnote: -- This marked the fourth film during the '50s that Ronald Reagan and Rhonda Fleming appeared together in. They were good friends professionally and politically. Ms. Fleming's politics were quite compatible with the 40th president of the United States.

Tennessee's Partner is a nicely crafted B western and good entertainment even if we never do learn the real names of both Tennessee and Cowpoke.

Reagan, Caruso, Johnson, Ankrum and Healey all appeared in ""Cattle Queen of Montana"" made by the same team a year earlier.

1668891,5,B00005UWA7,"Former song and dance man turned action-man hero John Payne plays Tennessee whilst Ronald Reagan plays Cowpoke (we never know their real names) both had done recent westerns in 1954 under veteran director Allan Dwan, Payne in Silver Lode and Reagan in Cattle Queen of Montana with Barbara Stanwyk. In all Dwan made ten films for producer (including the above) Benedict Bogeaus of which Tennessee's Partner was said to be his favourite. John Alton was the highly regarded cinematographer for all the above westerns.

Payne is the moustachioed gambler in the gold-mining town of Sandy Bar. Reagan is the cowboy who rides into town and saves his life. In return Payne feels he must expose the girl Reagan is about to marry as a gold-digger. Emotions run deep as Cowpoke sets out to track Tennessee down and kill him. Rhonda Fleming plays Tennessee's girlfriend Duchess who runs the saloon called ""The Marriage Market"" Coleen Gray plays the gold-digging girlfriend aptly named Goldie. Look out for a young Angie Dickinson as Abby Dean one of the saloon girls. Anthony Caruso is the main villain of the piece whilst Leo Gordon turns in a strong performance as the no-nonsense sheriff.

By the 1950's the traditional ""B"" westerns had more or less faded out, they were replaced by co-features or supporting films as they were sometimes known. Made in Technicolor and running for eighty-odd minutes with western stars of some standing like Joel McCrea, Randolph Scott, Rory Calhoun and others.  Now, we can see many of these films again in their true glory thanks to VCI Entertainment for these digitally re-mastered prints. Tennessee's Partner is one the best of these films on DVD.

In 1959 John Payne survived a terrible car accident, putting him out of work for two or more years, as a result of this his film output was never the same again. He died in 1989 aged 77 years. Reagan at this time was President of the Screen Actors Guild and moving into mainline politics became Governor of California in 1966. In 1970 he was elected as the 40th President of the United States of America, surviving a assassination attempt early in his presidency, he went on to serve two full terms. Not bad for a ""B"" movie cowboy!",1146787200,6,2208,4.8179419525065965

1668893,5,B00005UWA7,"'Tennessee's Partner' is a terrific saga based on the novel by the famous Western author Bret Harte.

 Beautifully produced by RKO studios in 1955, and filmed in gorgeous Technicolor, this film stars the underated actor
John Payne, as the shrewd, but honest card expert Tennessee. He has no friends in the entire town, except for his dance hall girlfriend played by Rhonda Fleming, whose flaming red hair is spectacular in Technicolor!  Tennessee walks into an ambush and is nearly murdered by a losing player,when his life is saved by a cowpoke who wanders into town. He even calls himself Cowpoke, and he is a complete straight-shooting arrow, played wonderfully by Ronald Reagan! Reagan becomes Tennesee's pal and partner, and Tennessee returns the favor by preventing Cowpoke from marrying an obvious goldigger!

 In the end, another bushwacker attempts to shoot Tennessee in the back, but loyal Cowpoke deliberately stands in the line of fire, taking the bullet for his pal. Tennessee nearly kills the villain, who is played flawlessly by Anthony Caruso, but instead decides to hand him over to the law. However, Cowpoke dies and a stunned, grief-stricken John Payne stands over his friend's body and says aloud, 'I never even knew his name!' Tennessee buries his only friend, marries his girl and makes for a fresh start out in San Francisco.

 'Tennessee's Partner' is a classic, western morality play, directed by Allan Dwan, and the entire cast gives first-rate performances. The DVD quality is top knotch.",1054512000,30,1515,5.109311740890688

7955574,4,B00005UWA7,"SPOILER ALERT!

As anyone who knows me will tell you, I am all about horror movies, but sometimes I dare the other genres. It's usually hit and miss with me when it comes to cowboys (I prefer Jason or Freddy to cowboys), but I've viewed a few John Wayne horse operas and I've just recently discovered and started enjoying how exceptional an actor Ronald Reagan was (regardless of your politics, movies are a completely different horse of a different color); this is my fifth Reagan western.

I've watched Sant Fe Trail, Cattle Queen of Montana, Law and Order and Cavalry Charge (my fav). I prefer the cavalry films (She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, Cavalry Command, the 7th Cavarly, the Undefeated, Major Dundee, Fort Apache and Rio Grande, to name the one's off the top of my head) over westerns (Rio Bravo, Will Penny, Arrowhead and Maverick as well as the one with Drew Barrymore, title escapes me are fun) but if the story is good you might get me planted in front of the boob tube.

If it looks like I've watched quite a few westerns for someone that likes horror just imagine how many horror films I've watched.

I think I've seen all of Reagan's westerns currently available here on Amazon, but this one, Tennessee's Partner, stands out because Reagan, the titular character, dies in a self-sacrfice for a not-quite-worth-it buddy at the end, which surprised me...reason for spoiler alert, natch! The usual unrealistic Hollywood bad-guy-turns-nice-guy-afterall ending, but I liked the movie anyhoo.

Reagan's westerns remind me of the Lone Ranger, which I grew up watching so this type of western (I guess it's the mid-20th Century moralism phase) appeals to me very well.

It's a colorful, fast-paced movie that seemed to end all-too soon, even though the ending was more self-serving than I cared for.",1351900800,,1803,4.856677524429967
7955575,5,B00005UWA7,"I already had this film and recently bought it as a gift for an actress friend too young to be familiar with the multi talented John Payne.  John is a local boy from where I write this, his old home place a stones throw away from our Salem, VA residence.  He was a musical, dramatic and Western star on screen and TV.  This is a delightful film which also costarred the beautiful Rhonda Fleming and Ronald Reagan doing one of his better acting roles.  A really neat Western.",1337472000,2,474,4.3522727272727275
