8229142,1,B000XPXTR8,"Based on the description alone, one can tell that this documentary shows Alinsky as a man of the people, helping the people to come to power. The description shows nothing but admiration or Alinsky, as if all he was about was helping ""the people!"" get the country they deserve.

For 99 cents you can see what Alinsky was really about, or at least consider that he may have been about more than this documentary acknowledges or is even aware of.

Another reviewer said that Alinsky was taught in college. I don't doubt it.

Do you guys have any idea what students were taught in Germany before WWI and then before WWII? Do you have any idea what students were taught during the rise of Mussolini?

To see the common philosophies guiding communists, socialists, national socialists, fascists, and progressives, including Wilson, FDR, JFK and Johnson and Obama and modern progressives, very much including Alinsky and Soros, read this:

Saul Alinsky proposed an alternative years ago in community organizing.  As goes the strength of our local communities, so goes the nation.  This film recounts the efforts of Alinsky and his proteges in community organizing.

Alinsky made a difference, and, perhaps, we too might make a difference in our world today.",1213747200,11,564,4.724489795918367
8229148,5,B000XPXTR8,"This documentary is a good introduction to the work of legendary organizer, Saul Alinsky.  Narrated by Alec Baldwin, and featuring interviews with many people Alinsky worked with, ""The Democratic Promise"" shows how people learned to get together and lobby their government and workplaces to promote their welfare.  Starting in meat-packing plants, moving on to struggles for housing, and being picked up by Vietnam war protestors, Alinsky's guidance has helped countless people to pressure for their causes.
The story of a community group working for housing in East Brooklyn is one of many inspiring stories in the film.  There's a wonderful scene when Mayor Rudolph Giulianni comes to their church and announces that he will support their cause and that they will receive the funding they need for their project.

Alinsky's life was a testament to what Frederick Douglass said about how power concedes nothing without a struggle.  This film is a much needed reminder of the need for that struggle, and the power that people do have when they organize.
