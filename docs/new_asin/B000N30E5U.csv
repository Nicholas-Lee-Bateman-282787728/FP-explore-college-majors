8174303,4,B000N30E5U,"For the uninitiated / non- EAST COAST BABY BOOMER, this was top of the line stand-up, incorporating the best in mime, one liners, story telling. Crystal is brilliant throughout. Even when he's not funny (some initial, ""period"" lameness, with ethnic stereotyping).

He rocks us thru his childhood, takes us to about his teen years, i.e., the 10 year old left alone for the first time (will he skip the scene as soon as Mommy closes the door behind her? or will he skip the scene in his imagination, which is much funnier?); first dates' bloodhound attacking his leg while he tries to communicate with her Dad, as she gets herself together, upstairs...too much.

Amazing concept: Billy plays himself plus several other ""auditioners"". But who wins the gig? Find out for yourself!",1389052800,,776,4.916030534351145
