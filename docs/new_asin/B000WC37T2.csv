8222169,5,B000WC37T2,"Do you long to cook like a chef? I do at times and by watching famous chefs prepare dishes you can get a lot of your own inspired ideas. In this DVD presentation Michel Bras explores the countryside all while waxing philosophical about his environment. Only a Frenchman could talk about the weather and landscapes and translate it into a gourmet dish. He is said to be a guru of cooking and also seems to be an artist with more creative ideas than he can produce. I got this feeling as he has a book he writes his ideas in and they are accompanied by his drawings.

One of the dishes looked like something I could actually make at home. It was monkfish saut&eacute;ed in black olive oil. To make the olive oil all you do is blend pitted olives and olive oil in the blender. That seemed simple enough for anyone to try. There are also sections where lots of vegetables are being blanched. Then there is the section on making chocolate lava cakes which looks interesting. No recipe was given but the techniques are there to teach you a lot. You can always find a recipe online.

What I loved about this film was all the precise artistic presentations. I got some ideas on how to cook potatoes in an oven. I will say however they are using some high tech ovens which probably cook a lot faster.

I found this film mesmerizing at times. The food looks so good and you might even be inspired to duplicate a recipe. I'm on a quest to watch every DVD in this series. They really are that good.

P.S. I tried the black olive oil and fish recipes using halibut and it was pretty good. I just blended black olives and a little olive oil and fried the fish in it. Do however be aware that fish sometimes has bones in it. Halibut has some sharp bones to avoid.",1474848000,,1769,4.316265060240964
