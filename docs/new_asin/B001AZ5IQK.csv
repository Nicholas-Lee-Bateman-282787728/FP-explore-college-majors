8280491,1,B001AZ5IQK,"I already had the Living Fireplace by Screen Dreams so I thought this would be very good also.  However, it is poorly done. The scenes look more like cartoons than the real life scene.  It is very disappointing especially knowing they made the fireplace so well, they have the capability to do it better.",1462924800,2,304,4.611111111111111
8280492,4,B001AZ5IQK,"I will admit that when I first started watching this I was disappointed that it wasn't a real beach. I thought ""living"" meant ""real."" What it really means is you are going to see animated animals living on animated beaches. So on the bright side, this is cute. There are three scenescapes on three different beaches. It is more like something you'd use to meditate for under eight minutes. You can play all three scenescapes one after the other for a good meditation session that will have you hypnotically entranced. I lost track of the time even though it was pretty short. The music repeats every 2 1/2 minutes. I'd say use this to relax in under ten minutes. For that I give it four stars. If you want to make this more fun you can make a smoothie with frozen bananas, pineapple and cherries. I put the fruit in the blender and add in coconut milk and half and half. I also put in two packets of stevia. The coconut milk is from a container that looks like a milk container not the canned coconut milk.

8280493,1,B001AZ5IQK,This DVD SUCKS! All 3 scenes look VERY FAKE....like it is a cartoon...or computer generated scenes. I was expecting REAL beach footage of ocean waves etc..... I am SOOOOO VERY DISSAPPOINTED.  I feel ripped off too. The fireplace video from screne dreams is more lifelike....REAL. This dvd is a rip off.,1401494400,4,302,4.921568627450981
8280494,1,B001AZ5IQK,"The living beaches DVD did not play at all so that was very disappointing and heart breaking to say the least. I don't know why it would not play other than to think that it was not the right format. However, all the others play from the same company.",1384560000,2,251,4.142857142857143
8280495,4,B001AZ5IQK,"nice for what i wanted it for. i wanted a peaceful, pleasant screen for my baby girl to watch. scenes aren't exactly realistic looking but still nice.",1355270400,2,150,4.592592592592593
8280496,2,B001AZ5IQK,"I expected real beaches, not a computer generated cartoony beach. The sound effect of waves will assist in a good nap but you wouldn't want to put this on to actually watch or as a background. Big disappointment, although it was cheap so I can't complain a lot.",1347753600,4,261,4.458333333333333
8280497,1,B001AZ5IQK,"First and foremost this is not a ""living beaches"" DVD.  It's a computer generated DVD and a bad one at that.  It looks really fake and I am printing out a return label as we speak.",1205280000,8,180,3.9722222222222223
