2104603,3,B0002MHDYW,"The Marx Bros. first five film return to DVD after being available for years from another label.

No doubt that HORSE FEATHERS (which sadly, will still be the edited, censored version) and DUCK SOUP are absolute pure Marxian joy (even despite the ever boring Zeppo). However, THE COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS, while containing some classic early comic bits from the boys, are arduous to sit through.

The most excrutiating moments come in the creaky musical duets between Oscar Shaw and Mary Eaton during COCOANUTS. At least DVD allows us to skip past those awful sequences. MONKEY BUSINESS is an uneven picture, at times very funny, at other times meandering.

Universal is boasting a 6th ""bonus disc"" which seems to only include a few old TODAY show interviews. Excuse me while I yawn.

They really could have gone to town and created new documentaries for at least DUCK SOUP and HORSE FEATHERS, the way Warner Bros. did for their superb NIGHT AT THE OPERA and DAY AT THE RACES. But no. Just a quickie excuse to charge a higher price.

Groucho himself always said A NIGHT AT THE OPERA was the best picture the brothers ever made. A casual fan might want to start with that before jumping in on this hit-or-miss set.",1097884800,8,1218,4.726415094339623
2104604,5,B0002MHDYW,"Now this is the collection you need to have of the Marx Brothers. I'm  not saying that the last 5 they put out aren't any good. It's just that they can't compare to these classics at all. The other ones have their moments,of course,but some are few and far between. A 6th disc of bonus material is a big plus,too!! You can't miss with this collection--A MUST!!!",1097798400,3,361,4.388059701492537
2104605,5,B0002MHDYW,"While the Marx Brothers may have enjoyed their greatest commercial successes at MGM, their first films, for Paramount, offer the purest essence of their genius, undiluted; irreverence, bawdiness, spontaneity, and an 'outside the box' approach to society that made everyone a potential target!

With the oft-maligned Zeppo as their resident 'straight man' (a misconception, as the youngest Marx could be every bit as funny as his older brothers), the Marxes were a sensation on Broadway, and their earliest films (THE COCONUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS) were actually produced in New York, while the brothers continued performing on stage, each night. While these films are dated, and a bit stiff, their cinematic potential was clearly evident, in Groucho's sly asides to the audience, Harpo's brilliant pantomime, and hedonistic, Pan-like pursuit of women, and Chico's comic fracturing of the English language.

MONKEY BUSINESS, their first feature made in Hollywood, benefits greatly from the more sophisticated Paramount production facilities, and a script far wittier than the 'pie-in-your-face' slapstick that Hollywood was cranking out. If you think A NIGHT AT THE OPERA offered the ultimate 'stowaway' sequence, watch MONKEY BUSINESS, and see the mayhem the boys could REALLY produce when they cut loose! HORSE FEATHERS is equally good, as Groucho runs a grand old college to the ground, while his 'son', Zeppo(!), pursues the 'Campus Widow'...along with Harpo, Chico, and even Groucho!

DUCK SOUP, their final film at Paramount, is the very best of the collection, and one of greatest film comedies ever made, period! Groucho mismanages the country of Freedonia into war, as Chico and Harpo 'spy' on him. For a film over seventy years old, the film is remarkably timely, with a musical climax, as Groucho manipulates the government and people into a war-crazed frenzy, that seems astonishingly topical, considering our own political climate!

Ultimately, the Marx Brothers were, perhaps, too sophisticated for audience's tastes, DUCK SOUP flopped, commercially, and Paramount dropped the team, opening the door for MGM and Irving Thalberg to hire and 'reinvent' them (as Zeppo moved on to become an agent/manager).

Combined with the recently-released boxed collection of MGM/RKO/UA Marx titles, the Paramount collection nearly completes the entire Marx output as a team, with only LOVE HAPPY, Harpo's 'pet' project (which could only be financed by appearances by Chico and Groucho), not included in the collections (the brothers would all appear in THE STORY OF MANKIND, seven years after LOVE HAPPY, but not as a team).

This boxed set is a MUST, whether you're a Marx fan, or just someone who loves classic comedy! Buy it...I guarantee you WON'T be disappointed!",1097280000,70,2766,5.391203703703703
2104606,5,B0002MHDYW,"I am 23. I discovered the Marx Bros. when I was 15 of so after catching Duck Soup on TCM. I was hooked. The rapid-fire wit of Groucho, the pairing of Chico and Harpo as one of the funniest duos ever, and Zeppo as the crooning straight-man. Don't forget Margaret Dumont as Groucho's constant foil. She is as much a Marx member as Zeppo to me. This is timeless comedy, with something for everyone, so don't get hung up on the fact it is in black and white, or that it has somewhat dated musical numbers. That is part of the charm. Also, you can't beat the price, really. The first print DVD's currently run 30 dollars or more a piece, and that's used! If you are going invest in any box set this fall, here is where you should lay your money.",1095811200,6,740,4.181818181818182
2104607,5,B0002MHDYW,"The early Marx brothers movies are, in my opinion, some of the finest cinematic comedies of the 20th century. The brothers Marx were manic geniuses, and blazed the trail for comics like Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. In fact, Allen pays a musical homage to Groucho in Everybody Says I Love You. Duck Soup stands out in a collection of gems by being arguably the best Marx Bros. comedy of all time. I say arguably, because A Night at the Opera is preferred by some because it has something in it called a ""Plot"", but the wild fun is nowhere more apparent, and sharper, than in Duck Soup. The other early films are also tack sharp and harken back to the boys' vaudeville days where anything could, and did, happen on the stage. These DVDs will be brought out again and again with something new found at each viewing because of the boys' rapid-fire delivery...and also because you will have been laughing so hard the last time you watched it, you will have missed a lot! I heartily recommend these movies as timeless and hilarious treasures.",1095552000,5,1035,4.56989247311828
2104608,4,B0002MHDYW,"The rule of thumb for the films of ther Marx Brothers is that if Zeppo is in it, then it is a Paramount film and is one of their best.  Now this is not because Zeppo is in it, although those who knew the Marx Brothers in real life said Zeppo was the funniest off screen.  And Zeppo subbed for all his brothers at various times in vaudeville with the audience being none the wiser.  It takes talent to do that.  Although he is shown to best advantage in film in Monkey Business and Horsefeathers, Zeppo really did not get enough to do.  Too bad.

It is just that the Paramount films are much, much better than the big budget MGM fare.  Look at how much funnier Groucho is in these films compared to his forced performance in At The Circus, for instance.  And the edginess of Harpo and Chico is so diluted by the time they did the MGM films.

I too am hoping for some exquisite extras from this Universal box se,  I especially hope they found a really ggod print of HOORSEFEATHERS.  Previous VHS and laser disc releases from Ubiversal were not only scratchy but there were a lot of frame jumps.  And I have British books on the Marx Brotehers that describe scenes from this film that I never saw.  Maybe the British version was longer.  Who knows?  But if someone at Universal is on the ball, wouldn't it be great to view footage of the Marx Brothers that no one has seen in 70 years?  And if so I am upgrading my rating to 5 stars and beyond.",1094256000,,1441,4.2234432234432235

2104611,5,B0002MHDYW,"I was delighted to see suddenly this item suddenly appear on Amazon.  The job that Warner DVD did on the MGM releases was just fantastic.  I hope that it will motivate Paramount to ""up the ante"" in terms of quality and features in this release of the Marx Brothers comedies in their library.

For the record, I especially enjoy the audio commentary by Glenn Mitchell and Leonard Maltin on ""A Day At The Races"" and ""A Night At The Opera"" on the MGM boxed set.  I would hope that since there was a story behind each of these Paramount productions there would be similar care in telling those stories in each of these classic movies.

Regardless, these are great movies and my pre-order is in!  5-stars, sight unseen - how's THAT for blind faith?",1091836800,5,743,4.507462686567164

2104638,5,B0002MHDYW,"Not really. Even Prof. Wagstaff would want this set. A couple extra minutes of Animal Crackers alone is worth the price.

Beyond that, this set is a marked improvement over the DVD release. Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers are both cleaned up nicely, with scratches and other damage to the film removed, and levels and contrast much improved. Also, floating of the image within the frame is eliminated. However, the worst damage in Cocoanuts  during parts of the auction and party scenes  are still markedly poorer in quality than the rest of the movie. The other notable change is the framing: The Blu-ray set is generally framed so that more of the image at the bottom of the frame is visible. In Animal Crackers, this allows the modern viewer to finally see silverware coming out of Harpos sleeve. Unfortunately, an exception occurs in Cocoanuts, again in the auction scene, where the framing is set higher and Harpo is partially cut off as he rows himself off screen. If you are not familiar with the action, you might have difficulty figuring out whats happening.

As for the other three films, its sufficient to say about the video that its typically cleaner and sharper as per a digital remastering. The framing is somewhat different but not significantly. The lighting at the end of Monkey Business is much improved. The extent of the damage to the singing lesson scene of Horse Feathers unfortunately remains the same. Also, for the last 15 minutes or so much of the framing is quite a bit tighter; when the pig jumps out of Harpos bag, the viewers glimpse of it is fleeting. The audio in Duck Soup does have some distortion during Grouchos opening song, as noted elsewhere, and Chicos line Believe me, hes one smart dog sounds less dubbed than on the DVD.

Overall, this set is a must-have for any devoted Marx fan.",1512777600,6,1822,4.735015772870662

2104659,5,B0002MHDYW,"I have bought these films in vhs, dvd and now blu ray formats. These films have been some of my favorite films since my childhood and are among the greatest comedies ever made. The new blu ray transfer greatly improves the picture and sound quality. The one thing I have to ask is why there is still missing frames/glitches in Horse Feathers during the couch scene with Groucho and the college widow. Is there only one surviving master reel of this film?

As to the content of the films in this collection, these films are the Marx Brothers at the height of their talents. The lightning fast dialogue must have really shaken up audiences of the time who were just adjusting to the introduction of sound in the movies after thirty years of silent movies. The anarchy the Marx Brothers unleash on the screen during the time period of these films is relentless and nothing is sacred, especially the wealthy dowager. The only thing that slows the pace down is the musical numbers. While Chicho Marx is one of my all time favorite piano players and his numbers are great fun, and you can forgive Harpo's harp pieces, even though they drag the pace down; it's the singing musical numbers that are painful pace-killers (except of course Groucho's ie: Hello I Must Be Going, Hooray For Captain Spaulding, Whatever It Is I'm Against It, etc.) and really date the films. I guess even in the 1930's, film studios were trying introduce songs in films to sell records in stores; maybe audiences were expecting musical numbers after the introduction of sound into movies. These musical numbers are probably carry-overs from the stage versions of the show, when the Brothers were off stage changing wardrobe or taking a break.
Animal Crackers is my favorite Marx Brothers film.",1501286400,3,1762,4.777049180327869

It's very much comedy history, spontaneous and uneven, not 21st century entertainment. But it does lead delightfully into the MGM years, where the mayhem was raised a level of two. I love it, so does my son. You can see future echoes of The Goons, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Beatles and many others here.

The 4-star rating is because I don't enjoy Harpo as much as I did when I was a kid. Before puberty, I thought it was funny and harmless when Harpo chased women around. Now, it just seems like creepy stalker behavior. Of course, in the 1920s and 1930s, nobody talked about sexual harassment.

2104701,5,B0002MHDYW,"Blu-Ray restoration of pre-Code Animal Crackers ~ Wonderfully sexy with newly added scenes!!!

Animal Crackers has been my favorite Marx Brothers film since the first time I saw it on the Big Screen back in the late 1970s after it was rediscovered. Animal Crackers has more quoted lines from it than any other Marx Brothers feature, and for good reason. The writing in it sparkles. It was only their second sound film, but it was the last based on one of the Marx Brothers Broadway plays. It was a smash hit on stage because the brothers had time to polish the script, their delivery and added improvisations based on the live audience reactions. All of which was built on their decades long Vaudeville career and their recent Broadway smash Coconuts also turned into one of the finest musical comedies ever, let alone 1929!

SPOILERS:

But the recent Blu-Ray restoration added several censored lines that have been missing for decades. I noticed at least four: 1) At the party scene at the beginning of Groucho's speech about going on safari in Africa he talks about an alligator aiming a gun at Groucho. When asked what he did, he answers married the alligator's daughter. 2) At the dictation scene at the beginning of Groucho's letter he mentions a girl getting scratched. 3) At the end of the letter Zeppo as his secretary mentions a girl getting scratched and Groucho says it's the other way around the man scratches the girl! 4) In the scene where Harpo wakes up on the bench, sleeping on the paintings the neighbor lady tries to get the stolen paintings away from him saying she knows what a woman wants and Harpo then spanks her rear end using the painting.

Bottom line: A very funny film with some pre-Code risqu&eacute; lines put back in. 10 stars!",1482796800,2,1759,4.701298701298701

Yeah, and if wishes and buts were candy and nuts we would all have a Merry Christmas.
As a side note, and as another reviewer has noted, it is puzzling as to why F.X. Feeney, a man who knows so very little about the Marx Brothers, was chosen to say even one word about the Marx Brothers, let alone provide an entire film commentary. The guy is terrible.

The comedy is timeless, but the celluloid was not. This is the clearest, cleanest transfer that I have seen of these films, and overall, I am quite pleased.

I project them using a Ben-Q projector onto a 6' diagonal screen and find it hard to believe that their original audiences had it much better than this.

2104706,5,B0002MHDYW,"Enough is known about these films to repeat them here again, so let's talk about the ""grumbles"" with quality.

First and foremost is that these films, particularly THE COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS are films made when every thing about them was new in the way of sound recordings!! These two were filmed in New York.

In THE COCOANUTS for example, the young romantic couple are having a conversation at a table and it really is hard to hear what they say as the orchestra in the background was actually playing LIVE!!! So all the sound was being recorded at the same time!! It would appear they had no idea of ""over dubbing""!!! Hence, the problems with the sound and the reason they probably can't improve it but why should they? That's how it was done then.

Another problem is when people are speaking and turn their heads away from the microphone set ups, the voice levels drop (not too low) which was hilariously sent up in ""Singing"" In the Rain""!! Leave it the way it is because it is in film making which is significantly historical.

From ""MONKEY BUSINESS"" on, filmed at Paramount in Hollywood, things in the sound department and image improve immeasurably.... and wisely concentrated on the Marx Bros and not much else in the way of secondary leads and story line. ""What story?"" ""I wouldn't make a film if it had a story in it!!""",1482019200,2,1337,4.605042016806722

2104711,5,B0002MHDYW,"The Marx Brothers - Groucho, Chico, Harpo and Zeppo - are beyond a doubt one of the most iconic comedy teams in the history of entertainment. Their zany antics, sharp witticism and merciless assault on snobbery have endured for more than a century; from their Vaudeville roots and subsequent success on Broadway, to their rise to stardom in films and radio, then resurgence on television, and finally through mass marketing of their movies on home video.

The latest incarnation of Marx mayhem is Universal's Blu-ray set of their five Paramount releases: THE COCOANUTS (1929), ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930), MONKEY BUSINESS (1931), HORSE FEATHERS (1932) and DUCK SOUP (1933). Made during Hollywood's unbridled pre-Code era, this quintet of comedic masterworks is representative of the Marx Brothers at their most surreal and anarchistic. These essential ingredients made their brand of humor truly unique, and became 'properly' compromised under the stricter regulations of the Production Code in 1934. Even the Marx's first film for MGM, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (1935), which many consider to be their best, isn't nearly as free and insane as the Paramounts. A need was felt at the time for the comedy to be grounded by strong storylines, romantic subplots and glossy, musical production numbers. The void caused by the exit of Zeppo as straight man was filled by various capable leading men, but it just wasn't the same as it was when there were the four brothers running amok and wreaking hilarious havoc.

This collection was sourced from the best available 35mm elements and remastered in 4K HD resolution for the highest quality presentation. That said, there are still some age related issues one must allow for, such as light scratches and audio hiss, all of which is minimal for the most part. The title that contains the brunt of such anomalies is the Marx's cinematic debut, THE COCOANUTS, which suffers from the early sound recording technology as well as having footage replaced in spots from lower grade elements. HORSE FEATHERS also still has some missing frames in the scene where the boys are running in and out of Thelma Todd's apartment. On the plus side is the restoration of a minute and a half of previously censored footage to ANIMAL CRACKERS. This was made possible by Universal acquiring an uncut, duplicate negative of an original release British print. Audiences are now able to enjoy the film as it was first shown 86 years ago. Happily, any digital cleanup was kept at a minimum, thus giving off a pleasing grain configuration that preserves the organic image quality of the source. It can safely be said that these classics have never looked better, and die-hard fans would do well to upgrade.

Extras include a new documentary, ""The Marx Brothers: Hollywood's Kings of Chaos"", five new  audio commentaries by Harpo's son Bill Marx, film historians Anthony Slide, Jeffrey Vance and Robert S. Bader, film critics F.X. Feeney and Leonard Maltin, the Today Show interviews with Groucho, Harpo and Bill Marx, and an exclusive illustrated booklet on their career.

Treat yourself to this wonderful collection of some of the flat-out funniest movies ever made. Marx madness is a guaranteed tonic for the humdrum 'normalcy' of everyday life.

All films have been totally restored, sound and vision (the sound has been equalised throughout the films so there is no increase/decrease in volume as the actors move closer or further away from the microphone), and ""Animal Crackers"" has been lovingly restored to its original pre 1936 version, fully restored as it was originally meant to be seen when it was released in 1930, before it was savagely cut to suit the production standard codes of 1936. There is commentary on each film by selected and noted film historians, including Harpo's son, Bill Marx, that are well worth listening to. Do Not Confuse this set with the standard DVD version under the same title. It has the same special features as the standard version, as well as new additional features that make this Blu-ray set a must.

2104744,5,B0002MHDYW,"I needed a present for the oldies and saw they were releasing the first set of Marx Brothers on Blu-ray, so i preordered this set.

I have dvd versions of almost all the movies across all the studios they worked with. The image quality is definitely better and clearer than the dvd when directly comparing both images. The blu rays have have no noticeable 'cigarette burns' or cue marks where in the dvd editions they appear constantly. Certain scenes are more in focus although you can notice some distance shots are still out of focus (still better than the dvd). Overall image quality is brighter, crisper, more in focus and sharper overall. The sound quality is also a great leap from any dvd version i compared it with.

The oldies said it was the clearest they have ever seen it, and it is the clearest version of the movies i have ever seen as well. Some say there are certain scenes missing, but as these are there earlier/first releases from the Marx Bros i am not completely familiar with them unlike the later releases like go west or day at the races.

Overall its an improvement in image and audio quality on films made from 1929 so while many expected a full 4k restoration, that was always going to be unlikely for such a small market.

The extras include a short booklet, documentary, some today show interviews and of course audio commentary for every movie (one of them being by Harpos son, Bill Marx). The case is quite detailed and interesting to see the brothers in colour.

It worked as a great present, maybe for film connoisseurs this isn't enough. But i'd say for us regular enthusiasts of the Marx Brothers, it is definitely worth a buy.",1478649600,11,1663,4.585858585858586
2104745,3,B0002MHDYW,"I am comparing this so-called restored BD version with the Universal USA DVD set and the Universal UK set, from 2004 and 2006 respectively. The only video ""restauration"" means the celluloid scratches have been now largely removed on the BDs. Why were they not removed in 2004 2006, beats me.  Also, the BDs are a lot grainier now, showing lack of professionalism (or interest) from the restauration team. The soundtrack is comparable with the one in the DVD edition. It is worse than the CDs that were issued with the music from the movies about 10 years ago.
As this is the third attempt form Universal to put these movies in a digital format, I think it is time, Universal, to give the rights - and the job - to the professionals at Criterion. You don't show any respect from this important work, and for this part of your studio's history.
The Charlie Chaplin DVD collection by Warner is contemporary with the Marx Universal DVD set (2004). The quality of the work is ages ahead of the DVD set and, if I dare to say, at least comparable, if not better, than these brand new blurays.
I am including two pictures from the Cocoanuts. There are better images than those, but I wanted you to see how low the restauration's team threshold was. I am playing these on a PS4 with the latest updates and on a 65 inch Samsung TV. Please ignore the moire.

2104746,2,B0002MHDYW,"This set ultimately disappoints as there simp! y hasn't been proper care taken with the 'restorations'. Indeed, I take a lot of convincing all five movies have infact been restored.

The set opens with a very clean looking and sounding copy of 'The Cocoanuts', no complaints, this has been well restored although some poor source sections are very obvious.

The second movie 'Animal Crackers' is complete! Sourced from an original (pre Hays Code) duplicate negative found in the British Film Institute's archives This movie has come from a good source and the print has been restored competently and is well presented, no complaints!

Unfortunately, 'Monkey Business' from the opening sequence shows scratches that could have been removed with a little care, worse they are pretty comparable with my UK DVD copy. What restoration?

It's a huge shame that a better source copy of 'Horse Feathers' wasn't found as the huge number of 'Hays Office' cuts ruin the potentially hilarious sequence in the 'college widows' apartment.  Some basic scratch removal has been applied, but there's nothing here to make upgrading from DVD worthwhile.

Duck Soup is a mess, massively inferior to even my UK sourced DVD having very similar visual quality but massively distorted sound from the first song which isn't on the DVD!

This is a poor package. The copies of 'The Cocoanuts' and 'Animal Crackers' are well worth having. The rest are just a disappointment and little better than the 'unrestored' DVD. Duck Soup is worse.

I contacted Universal about the Duck Soup audio and was sent a replacement disc with the same fault. When I emailed them back to say the fault was still there their response was polite but clearly meant 'We don't care'!

Viewing and comparisons were made on a 104"" screen in my full HD home theatre and also on a 50"" Panasonic TV.

So two stars for The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers. The rest is a waste of time if you already own a copy of the movies and in the case of Duck Soup you're actually better off with the DVD!",1477699200,50,2033,4.816091954022989

I was turned on to the Marx Brothers at a very young age...I've joked that Groucho was my speech therapist.  Needless to say, I was extremely pleased to see a blu ray release of these movies (Warner Brothers...your turn).  Animal Crackers stands as my favorite of the films and this new release restores censor cut material that had previously been missing.  I cannot complain about the films themselves.

However, there is a nasty issue with the audio in Duck Soup.  Starting with the song ""Laws of my Administration"" the audio becomes distorted.  I thought perhaps it was my blu ray player, but I spoke to my father (who also purchased the set) and he noticed the same trouble.  He called it Intermod Distortion.  Popping in the older DVD release, the older audio was quite clear and free of distortion.

I do plan to contact Universal directly to inform them of the difficulty.  I have uploaded a clip from my phone of the scene where the trouble begins.",1477180800,81,1480,6.038277511961723

THE NEW RESTORED BLU-RAYS ARE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT, FEATURING NEW TRANSFERS, ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE AND MORE BONUS FEATURES. IT IS A MISTAKE THAT UNIVERSAL HOME VIDEO IS GIVING IT THE SAME NAME (""Silver Screen Collection"") AND ARTWORK.

AS OF NOW, THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY PLANS TO RELEASE THE RESTORED FILMS IN THE DVD FORMAT. SO IF YOU BUY THAT PACKAGE, YOU ARE GOING TO GET THE SAME OLD VERSION WHICH HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS.",1472169600,211,514,4.775280898876405
2104764,4,B0002MHDYW,"I bought the DVD set new for $12.50. The picture and sound quality were so-so and the bonus features were minimal at best. The DVD's were not remastered very well and the original source prints are no longer available, so it is a challenge to get these film prints, many of which are damaged or have whole scenes severely edited looking and sounding good. From what I have read the new 2016 Blu-ray edition is only a slight improvement in terms of picture and sound over the DVD set and once again Universal decided to be stingy on the bonus features, with a few audio commentary tracks and vintage Today show interviews with the brothers. Universal really needed to do some serious global detective work and hunt down the best prints available on this planet and then spend some money cleaning and editing them. One scene in particular from Horse Feathers has languished in deplorable condition for decades. The importance of these films warrants a first-class restoration and remastering.

The movies themselves are absolute treasures, chronicling the greatest comedy team in US history, unless you include Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro. These five classics feature all four Marx Brothers including Zeppo (sorry no Gummo!). Groucho is clearly the leader and the star, but he was never quite as funny without the support of his brothers. The musical numbers by Chico and Harpo showcase their talent proving they are just as innovative as they are entertaining. With Margaret Dumont as his foil for several films, Groucho takes the insult and one-liner into uncharted comedic territory for the time. The first three films are rather primitive in terms of sound and camera work, and have the feel of a somewhat crudely filmed stage production. With the final two films, the brothers really came into their own with Duck Soup, considered by many to be the Citizen Kane of American comedies.",1471824000,11,1895,4.959119496855346

I also love to watch the parts where Chico plays the piano. I just happened to catch a Marathon of these movies on TCM a couple of years ago and had to have them. The wit and charm of this kind of comedy really brightens my day. Margaret Dumont is almost like a Marx sister. The only difference is she always plays the serious role. I actually have both box sets but I would say the first box is the better. Some of the later movies seem to lack the wit and banter of the earlier ones. I love each one of these movies, with Horse Feathers and Duck Soup being my favorites, so it just made sense to get the box set. I just can't believe that none of these films have been restored or put on Blu-ray yet. Especially since the Honor given to Duck Soup.

Zeppo who was only in their Parsmount movies left the act after Duck Soup cause he wasn't let to be funny as the others which was a shame.

The first movie, The Cocoanuts, is definitely the weakest link, but it still has very good, classic moments.  The others, Animal Crackers, Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup are, in my opinion, the best comedy films ever made.  At this point, the brothers were operating on nothing but pure inspiration and drive.  Unless you're dead, you just have to laugh yourself silly at this stuff. These films represent the Marxes (and perhaps American comedy in general) in their anarchic, smarmy, wise-cracking heyday.  There have never since been any movies quite like these.  After the brothers left Paramount for MGM, their comedy was toned down in an attempt to make their characters more sympathetic to audiences, as opposed to the totally reckless, selfish, and oblivious types they play here.

2104938,5,B0002MHDYW,"I'm so glad I bought this set.  Instead of the previously released Universal 6-Disc Collection (which costs more), this set is a 2-disc set with all five of the Marx Brothers' Paramount movies (The Cocoanuts, Animal Crackers, Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup).  This 2-disc set has everything that was included on the 6-disc set.  Also, these transfers look a lot better than the Image Entertainment DVD's that were released of the individual movies in 1995 and 1996.

I was skeptical and confused about purchasing this set because of some of the reviews I read about this set online.  I read that Groucho's scene ""My father was a little headstrong, my mother was a little armstrong.."" was edited out of ""Duck Soup"" and that some other edits were also made.  I watched these DVD's and there definitely doesn't look like any edits were made.  The running time for each movie matches the running time of the Image Entertainment DVD's as well.

This set (like the 6-disc set) also includes the three brief Today Show interviews with Harpo Marx, Groucho Marx, and William Marx (Harpo's son).  There are some hilarious routines in these five movies, which include four of the Marx Brothers: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo.",1406332800,12,1233,4.917874396135265

2104959,5,B0002MHDYW,"These are the essential Marx Brothers movies, their first five movies for Paramount. ""Cocoanuts"" and ""Animal Crackers"" were successful Broadway plays and the dialogue is hilarious. I think Cocoanuts was actually the first sound comedy (or at least one of the first) and while it's a little stiff and hokey at times, it manages to capture some of the anarchy that made the Broadway productions so successful. That manic quality continues in ""Horsefeathers"" and ""Monkey Business"" and reaches the peak with ""Duck Soup"" - made in 1933, just four years after Cocoanuts, but the production values by this time had improved by leaps and bounds. While their next film for MGM, ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), is not part of this package, and is often regarded as the pinnacle of their movies, one gets to see the real personality and quality of their act in the first four films, before Irving Thalberg molded them to the MGM style. Thalbergs tragic death and Louis B. Mayer's animosity toward the brothers led to a increasingly weaker films with MGM. The writing and music in the first films was truly exceptional.",1390780800,3,1106,4.857142857142857

These earlier 5 movies also include Zeppo, who's a great contrast to the wittiness of the other 3 Marx brothers.  The humor in these movies never gets old, and you'll be quoting Chico and Groucho for a long time to come!

2104977,5,B0002MHDYW,"The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection is six hours and fifty - four minutes and was released on DVD on November 9, 2004. In this collection you have the first five Marx Brothers movies; if you don't include Humor Risk. In this collection you have Chico, Harpo, Groucho and Zeppo. Zeppo would leave the group after Duck soup and the brothers would become a trio. I would like to know the real truth why Zeppo left and not some crack pot fan excuse. In the Paramount Pictures collection the brothers just act zany with no real story behind it; Monkey Business is the best example. Starting with MGM the Marx Brothers start to help people. In this collection three of the films have trailers to them. The downsides to this collection are the book that comes with it. The book is glued in the case and you can't take it out and read it. Second it the Bonus Materials disc; basically you get three Today Show interviews with Harpo, Groucho, and Harpo's son William and that is all. In my opinion not much of a bonus. With some of the movies I wish they came with an audio commentary so one could learn something behind the making of the movie. The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection is a great addition to any Marx Brothers fan and gets an AAAA++++.

The Cocoanuts is one hour and thirty - three minutes and was release in theaters on May 3, 1929. The main plot is that Mrs. Potter valuable necklace is stolen and the wrong person is accused of the crime. The Marx Brothers clear his name and bring the two guilty people to justice. Actually only Harpo and Chico try to help clear Bob Adams name. That is basically the whole movie in a nutshell. Basically the Cocoanuts in the four Marx brothers acting zany throughout the movie. You have the famous ""why a duck"" scene with a lot of musical numbers thrown in. My favorite number is the Tale of the Shirt. Some footnotes about this picture are the Marx Brother were doing double duty, they were doing the Broadway version of Animal Crackers at night and in the early morning hours working on the Cocoanuts. Another thing is that Harpo's wig is much darker in this movie; in Animal Crackers and on he would wear a lighter color wig. Also in the stage version Chico and Harpo are giving names and in the movie version they have none. One final footnote is Zeppo gets first billing. Granted their names are left to right, but his is first. In the next four films the credits are as follows: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo. The Cocoanuts is a good movie, but in my opinion not a great a movie. The Cocoanuts gets a B+.

Animal Crackers is one hour and thirty - five minutes and was released in theaters on August 23, 1930. This is their second movie that was adapted from their play.

The painting getting stolen and the rest of the movie is trying to find the painting with mini subplots in the movie. Some lines from the original play were cut out and the only downside to this movie is the ending. Animal Crackers is a little bit better than The Cocoanuts. Animal Crackers gets an A-.

Monkey Business is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released in theaters on November 7, 1931. Basically the four brothers are stowaways on a ship and get mixed up with Mafia bosses. Groucho and Zeppo get mixed up with one of the Mafia bosses and Chico and Harpo become body guards for another. That is the basic storyline; during the rest of the film it is the Marx Brothers being their zany selves. This movie has a few firsts in it. This the first movie that was actually written for the brothers. The last two films were adaptations from their Broadway plays. Also this is one of the few times that Margaret Dumont is not in a Marx Brother movie. Though he sang in the last two movies, Groucho does not sing in this movie accept when he is hidden in the barrel early in the movie singing Sweet Adeline with his brothers. Zeppo gets more screen time but few scenes where he actually speaks, however he does get to play the hero at the end of the movie. With this movie there is an ongoing debate whether or not Harpo joined his other three brothers singing Sweet Adeline in the barrel scene since all four were hidden in the barrels at the time they were singing the song. Also Zeppo finds Maurice Chevalier passport and all four Marx Brothers sing You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me. When it is Harpo turns to sing You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me, he uses a mini phonograph and it Harpo's voice or Maurice Chevalier singing the song. Monkey Business gets an AA++ for being zany.

Horse Feathers is one hour and six minutes and was released in theaters on August 10, 1932. Basically Groucho, Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, is the new president of Huxley and his son Frank Wagstaff, Zeppo, convinces him that what the college needs is a strong football team. Professor Wagstaff goes to a speakeasy and recruit the wrong guys. He winds up with Pinky (Harpo) and Baravelli (Chico). The best thing about this movie are the plays called by Baravelli, an example is: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Professor Wagstaff gets the ball. Of all the Marx Brothers movies and that include those made after Zeppo left the group, this is the shortest movie of them all. Also this was Thelma Todd last movie with the Marx Brothers. Starting with Duck Soup and continuing to the Big Store, Margaret Dumont would be Groucho woman. This is a movie that was almost not made, Chico was in a car accident and production was halted for two months and Zeppo was already thinking about leaving the group. In this movie he was giving a bigger part to convince him to stay. Zeppo hung around for one more movie. Horse Feathers gets an AAA+++.

Duck Soup is one hour and eight minutes and was released in theaters on November 17, 1933. The main story is Rufus T. Firefly, played by Groucho Marx) takes over a bankrupt country called Freedonia and in the end has it going to war with its neighboring country Sylvania. Some facts about this movie are this would be Zeppo's last movie with his brothers and this would be the last movie the Marx Brothers would make with Paramount Pictures. Duck Soup did so poorly at the box office that Paramount released them from their contract. Some good laugh scenes are the motorcycle and side car. Each time Rufus tries to go somewhere Harpo leaves him stranded. In the last one where Harpo drives off in the sidecar and Groucho gets left behind on a stalled motorcycle he quips this is the only way to travel. Also you have the famous mirror scene in it as well. By the way some info about the title, Duck Soup is slang for something easy to do. Duck Soup gets an AAAA++++ from me.

2104978,5,B0002MHDYW,"5 Marx Brothers movies for $11.99!! For movies that are approximately 80 years old, the prints are fantastic. Sound quality and image quality are excellent. The best purchase I have made in a long time. Hail Fredonia!!!!",1373155200,2,220,4.972972972972973
2104979,5,B0002MHDYW,"Who likes, The Marx Brothers?. Actually I grew up, watching their films. One time, I had the chance to watch one their classic films at the Cinema. That film was ""The Marx Bother's at The West."" It's The Marx Bother's Western film,
to it's own wildest way. This collection, is a must have. You won't regret it!!!.",1372636800,,313,4.508771929824562
2104980,5,B0002MHDYW,"Bought it because I wanted a copy of Horsefeathers...the best Marx Bros. romp...
'Why don't you bore a hole in your head and let the sap run out?'",1372118400,,146,4.25
2104981,5,B0002MHDYW,I bought this item for my husband and he loves it. He laughs a lot while watching it. It is not my cup of tea but I am giving it 5 stars because my husband thinks so highly of it.,1371859200,,179,3.5
2104982,4,B0002MHDYW,"These films probably don't need my review because they've been classics for years. They are all the Marx Brothers at their very best, and anyone seeing them will be impressed at how funny they still are. Many comedies of the early 20th century now seem dated, even those by the great performers, but these are still fresh and unexpected as well as hilarious. My 16 year old son saw them with me and laughed as hard as I did. The movies themselves deserve 5+ stars, but these prints are showing their age, which is why I gave them 4. They are not remastered, so the quality of the film frequently changes from scene to scene. It does have some effect on the watching experience, so if you can get remastered versions I would say get them. Otherwise, this is a wonderful collection.",1370649600,5,780,4.5
2104983,5,B0002MHDYW,"a couple weeks ago i reviewed Universal's Complete Abbott & Costello set, so it seemed only fair, if not my duty, to similarly salute the one classic comedy team who managed to be even funnier than Bud & Lou!!
lunacy don't get much more inspired than it was in the hands of Groucho (the intellectual lothario), Harpo (the unearthly urchin of few words but many honks), Chico (the lovable conartist), and occasionally Zeppo (the ""normal"" odd man out). i grant you it comes pretty close in the hands of Abbott & Costello, Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and/or Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker, but alas, even those masters couldn't quite attain such a pinnacle as did the first family of lunacy. The Marx Brothers are The Beatles of cinematic comedy.
the first of the five, THE COCOANUTS, concerns Groucho's attempts to run a Florida hotel amidst various unforseen misadventures. this one is the least satisfying - not simply of this set, but of any Marx Brothers movie - possibly because it took the seasoned stage performers time to adjust their act for the Silver Screen. moreoever, many reviewers have bitched about how no attempt has been made to remaster the films. THE COCOANUTS is the print that has aged least gracefully (indeed the only one where the decay is noticeable enough to constitute a distraction). so it's ultimately more interesting as a conversation piece or collector's item than for any sort of cinematic achievement. (i'm not sure, but it could be the very first ""talkie"" comedy movie.)
[note to anal-retentives: i didn't misspell ""coconuts,"" they did.]
but it's all uphill from there. next comes their first film masterpiece, ANIMAL CRACKERS. this is the tale of the high society party, attended by alleged big-game hunter Captain Spaulding, at which, interspersed with ""bits of business,"" a valueable painting is stolen and reproduced twice. (did The Marx Brothers invented the Xerox machine?) since it, like THE COCOANUTS, is basically a filmed stage play, also because they have several plot points in common, one wonders how CRACKERS managed to achieve so much more grandeur. simple because it was the stronger vehicle, i suppose.
CRACKERS is also noteworthy for my all-time favorite Grouchoism: ""well, all the jokes can't be good, you've gotta expect that once in awhile.""
MONKEY BUSINESS, their first original story on film, tells the story of four hapless stowaways who get sucked into the mob en route. it's the one with the least cohesive storyline, but much like Abbott & Costello, The Marxes leave you in such stitches that you don't worry about (or even really notice) that.
next comes HORSE FEATHERS, the film in which Our Heroes wreak havoc on college life and tradition. again, the plot - concerning a local betting parlor's ""action"" on the collegiate ""big game"" - is practically incidental to the antic Marxism. this one is perhaps most noteworthy for initiating the trend of giving Groucho's character elaborate fancy names. would there be a Rufus T. Firefly or an Otis B. Driftwood withouth Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, i wonder?
and of course let us not forget their masterpiece, DUCK SOUP, easily the greatest political satire ever put to film. this tale of strife between the nations of Freedonia and Sylvania - boiling down to the false pride of two figureheads who simply don't ""click"" - makes a hell of a lot more sense out the regrettable existance of war than anything you'll ever read in your history class textbook. (i love the way Groucho is more or less immune to such extreme slurs as ""worm"" and ""swine,"" only for his boiling point to be the comparatively mild ""upstart."")
i want to take this opportunity to say that i'm just as much of a fan of the later, more structured films like A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and A DAY AT THE RACES. this is simply because The Marxes are prominent on my personal list of artists i enjoy/admire so much i can get into just about any demonstration of their talents. but there's still a discrepancy to consider. you may recall that in my Abbott & Costello review i mentioned the regrettable tendancy to weigh their films down with cornball love stories and uninspired songs. the same would of course happen to The Brothers when they relocated to MGM. studio head Irving Thalberg told The Brothers that their films under his auspices would be less ""chaotic"" and offer ""half as many laughs""...but because the audience would be rooting for them in a way they hadn't before, those laughs would have ""twice the value."" yeah, yeah, sounds like typical studio muckety-muck psychobabble to me, too - doesn't that technically mean they simply break even? - but it does reflect a bit of the thinking behind the cluttering up of certain films with things which don't necessarily have to mar the product but most likely will. (well, that and the fact that there was no television to suggest that a given film might live beyond it's theatrical run.) the latter three films in this set reflect what artists can do when they're no so hemmed in as The Marxes would end up being and, alas, Abbott & Costello would be form the get-go.
one cool turn of events is that in this edition they managed to compress the formerly 6-disc set neatly into 2!!
that second-favorite lament of the other reviewers - scanty special features in the form of a few Today Show clips - still applies, i'm afraid. yeah, it is kind of a bummer that we don't get a few commentaries, trailers, or making-of featurettes, but we do get what we really wanted. i suspect all those people who bemoaned the lack of special features feel better about this set than they would if they'd gotten an avalanche of special features but no movies!",1370476800,3,5660,4.824074074074074
2104984,5,B0002MHDYW,I am satisfied with my bought but not so satisfied with these silly region restriction. Now I have bought a regionfree DVD player but it is an expensive way to benefit from some pieces of the american culture.,1369008000,,209,4.526315789473684
2104985,5,B0002MHDYW,"The boys at their craziest.  Later they would ""clean up"" and have things like ""plot"" and ""character developmnent.""  In these they are just their for the laughs, and to destroy all order and reason.  If you haven't watched these movies, what are you waiting for?

The collection has no special features, but that's ok.  The movies are more than enough and the price is right.",1366588800,,374,4.6923076923076925
2104986,5,B0002MHDYW,"My husband loves the Marx brothers and he loves quoting them. When I got this as a gift for him on our anniversary, he was ecstatic. We have watched the movies in this collection a couple of times now. I like how well it is packaged and I love the bonus materials too.",1364515200,,268,4.0754716981132075
2104987,4,B0002MHDYW,A must if you love like the Marx Brothers and their zany brand of comedy. Utter madness at it's best.,1362960000,,101,4.1
2104988,3,B0002MHDYW,I guess I remembered only the hilarious nuggets from when I saw them many years ago on the big screen.,1360540800,,102,4.15
2104989,5,B0002MHDYW,"These are the early Marx Brother's movies. I don't know that it's fair to say they are better than their later works, they are simply some of my favorite  of their works. It was really nice to be able to get all five of the movies, with a lot of bonus material and information at such a great price.",1360108800,,299,4.067796610169491
2104990,5,B0002MHDYW,This is a must own for those that love the Marx brothers. It not only gives you most of their best movies but it also gives a special inside look at the men behind the characters.,1358035200,,179,4.0
2104991,5,B0002MHDYW,We have taped the Marx Brothers from television and bought the VHS tapes in the past and now it's great to have them on DVD! It has all of the things you would expect from movies this old and I think that is what gives it character. Wonderful purchase. Definitely would recommend it to anyone who likes the Marx Brothers.,1357430400,,321,4.366666666666666
2104992,5,B0002MHDYW,A welcome gift for any Marx Bros. fan or anyone who loves comedy. These are classics which showcase the incomparable talents of these marvelously talented troupe.,1356048000,,162,5.269230769230769
2104993,5,B0002MHDYW,My dad had introduced the Marx Brothers to me and my sister when we were little. When we grew up and actually listened to the punch lines we finally realized what the jokes were. They are jokes that make you think and are very clever. We had went to see a Groucho Marx impersonator whose name was Frank Farranti. He did really good he got everything down from his attire to his lines and motion.,1355356800,,395,4.28
2104996,5,B0002MHDYW,"I always loved the Marx Brothers. I remember loving it as a kid when their movies would play on TV on Saturday mornings. It must have been on AMC or something like that.

For some reason I always compare the 3 Stooges and the Marx Bros in my head. I was never a huge Stooges fan. I think the Marx Bros do a better job of combining physical comedy with really clever writing.",1353888000,,374,4.123287671232877
2104997,5,B0002MHDYW,What else is there to say! The Marx Bros. have always been a favorite of mine and many others. They are zany and as you can tell very intelligent also.,1352160000,,151,4.066666666666666
2104998,5,B0002MHDYW,"A friend loaned me this collection so I could see whether I wanted to purchase it.  My daughter (8) and son (6) watched them over and over last November (2011), memorized scenes, and decided to dress up at Groucho and Harpo for Halloween this year.  They are still acting out parts and even recruited a friend to play Chico for trick or treating.  I dressed up like Margaret Dumont, and my husband was straight man, Zeppo, for Halloween.  It was unforgettable.

This particular collection contains the very best of the classic Marx brothers films.  They are beautifully mastered, both visually and audibly, and the bonus materials (disc and book) are fascinating.  To get all of this in one collection is terrific; so often collections contain one or two great films and the rest is a waste.  Every one of these is a winner.  I wish someone would create an equivalent for W.C. Fields.

We finally bought this collection brand-new to give to our friend because we had played and read and played his until the boxes and book were very ""loved"".  If you are a Marx brothers fan, or even if you're just looking for an introduction to the fountainhead of American comedy, this is definitely the collection to get.",1351728000,,1207,4.7
2104999,4,B0002MHDYW,"To get a sense of how musical these comedies are, I attempted to count - not as easy as you might think - how many musical numbers or routines are in each film:

The Cocoanuts: 11.  In one musical number, a woman, with backup dancers, sings ""Do the Monkey Doodle Doo!""; perhaps a late 1920's dance craze?

Animal Crackers: 11.  The melody for ""Captain Spaulding Has Arrived"" will be instantly recognizable to those of you who have ever watched Groucho's 1950's TV show: You Bet Your Life!

Monkey Business: 7.  In one bit, each of the four stowaways try getting off the ship by using Maurice Chevalier's passport and singing a stanza of one of his songs (Harpo uses a miniature record player.)

Horse Feathers: 8.  Five of the music interludes are the same song ""Everyone Says, I Love You"":  Zeppo sings it, then Harpo whistles it, then later Chico sings it while playing the piano, then later Harpo plays it on his harp, and still later Groucho sings it while playing guitar!

Duck Soup: 3.  The winner of the most bizarre number goes to: ""We're going to War!""  At one point, the citizens of Freedonia are writhing in ecstasy in anticipation of their war with Sylvania!

Bonus disc:  Only 3 very brief clips ( a few minutes each) of Harpo, Groucho, and Harpo's son on the Today Show.

Picture (DVD) for The Cocoanuts: 2.5 to 3, grainy;  for Animal Crackers: 3, a few scenes are slightly out-of-focus; and for Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup: 3 to 3.5.

Subtitles:  English, French & Spanish.  Languages:  English & Spanish, except for The Cocoanuts, which is English only.",1341187200,4,1588,4.664259927797834
2105000,5,B0002MHDYW,"Shipping was prompt, actually ahead of schedule.  As for the product, well, for my money this collection is a must have, video quirks notwithstanding.  These are classics and should be a part of any serious video collection.",1334707200,,224,5.027027027027027
2105001,4,B0002MHDYW,"We just rewatched movies from this set this week (2012, when it was a gift given in 2004), and the discs are still in great shape.  The movies are from the era--so there are sound level issues and a few jumpy spots.

The box itself is a bit clunky, particularly because of the booklet that is on the inside, but not impossible to fold back, and then get everything into a box-shape.

The only downside is that because Night at the Opera (so I was told) was done at a different studio, it isn't part of this collection.  It isn't an entirely completely set, as there are other Marx Brothers movies (Go West, The Big Store, etc.) but it contains the other core movies for which they are best known.

The other downside (or upside, depending on how you view it) is that each disc only contains one movie.",1331856000,,801,4.348993288590604
2105002,5,B0002MHDYW,The 4 Marx brothers at there absolute best in some of the funniest movies that made them stars true comedy at its best! If you've never seen a Marx brothers movie your missing out on classic grade A comedy the kings of comedy that comedians generations after would copy for years for there classic subtlety a must see!!!!,1331683200,,321,4.551724137931035
2105003,4,B0002MHDYW,"Great collection of the first five Marx Brothers movies. The characters aren't as developed as in the later movies, but the stories are still full of the trademark mayhem. Should be in any collection of lovers of great comedy. Marx Brothers were the original and best!",1325376000,2,268,4.8478260869565215
2105004,5,B0002MHDYW,"Another costumer said it best ""no one said anything about restorations""
While I do think universal should have taken a bit more time with these amazing films before releasing them, we should look at the fact that all they offered was a box set, not a ton of extras and restorations. I think we've been spoiled by dvd and blu-ray, we expect every movie to have a million extras and we demand that old movies be restored but in all truth, that's all bonus... these companies don't HAVE to do any of that and the fact that we even got a box set with all of the movies should be good enough.
Rumors about the dvds being cut up, edited and censored, 100% bs, I've seen them on vhs, seen them on tv, seen the earlier versions on dvd, they are ALL still the same. You don't believe me do a quick search and you will find out this was all a hoax or a really crappy rumor. You won't find anyone of these people with actual proof, they never mention an actual scene or a piece of dialogue that's been ""cut"" and when they do it's always obscure and most people that are old enough or savvy enough will tell you that those things have never been in the movie in the first place.",1311984000,3,1166,4.1866666666666665
2105005,5,B0002MHDYW,"They broke out the stage and into the new sound movies with the same spontaneous mad energy of one of their door slamming bedroom farces, kicking society in the shin, stealing the silverware, and making off with a few women in the process. This collection, while not disregarding some of the gems on the later MGM collection, namely ""A Night at the Opera,"" ""A Day at the Races,"" and ""Room Service,"" trumps the later collection as the absolute Marx Brother must have.  To use a musical metaphor, this is the comedic equivalent of the most seminal jazz, rock, punk and alternative music all spun magically and whimsically together.  The only disappointment is the Chico and Groucho alternately trying to seduce the college widow scene in ""Horsefeathers,"" which is quite choppy with missing segments during Harpo's intrusions trying to foil the seducers by delivering ice that no one ordered.  I don't know if these scenes are lost in their entirety forever or if Universal just didn't work hard enough to restore this particular gem.  Besides this minor gripe of a real aficionado, and a few of the dated references that probably won't deliver laughs like they did at the time except to some especially erudite viewers, this collection is pure joy and essential to anyone with any-- uh--- serious interest in comedy.",1311552000,,1314,4.932126696832579
2105016,5,B0002MHDYW,"""Animal Crackers' is the two funniest movies I've ever seen, the other being ""It's a Mad, Mad World."" if you ever have the chance to see them on the big screen, do it. If you can arrange to show either in a theater, do it. In the mean time, there is Amazon.com, thankfully.",1311379200,,273,4.169811320754717
2105017,5,B0002MHDYW,"So many comedy collections from Charlie Chaplin to The Three Stooges fail to offer what the viewer wants: the best stuff they did. This collection features all 5 of the Marx Bros. films they did for Universal (and made with all 4 brothers). These are their best movies (minus ""A Night at the Opera"" which was released by MGM and therefore not a part of this set). No comedy lover should go without seeing ""Animal Crackers"" or ""Duck Soup.""

""The Cocoanuts"" has Groucho trying to auction land in Florida while running a hotel. It was based on their stage show and while the Irving Berlin garbage does get tedious to me when all I want to see the Marxes, it's got some great moments of comic anarchy.

""Animal Crackers"" is one of my all time favorite movies. Groucho squares off against everybody in this one and for my money this one has some of his best one liners. Based on another of their plays this one has Chico and Harpo stealing a famous painting from the incomparable Margaret Dumont.

""Monkey Business"" feels like two movies and has some of the worst acting from the costars, but the Marxes make it fun. After stowing away on a steamship they get mixed up with the mob and must rescue a kidnapped girl. The story is dopey, but what makes it work is little the brothers seem to care about anything...even rescuing the girl they purposely do poorly.

""Horse Feathers"" has the Marxes in a failing university. They must put everything on the big football game. Like their first two films where they poked fun at high society, this one affords them the great opportunity of impugning the education system. They do so with anarchic wit.

Finally ""Duck Soup"" might be one of their greatest, and certainly one of the greatest of all comedies. The songs all work in this one and are fun and funny. The director actually seems to understand he's making a Marx Bros. movie, and the plot is just loose and tight enough for them to derail. This time they take on the government and war. It's all good and has some of the most classic comedy scenes ever filmed.

The special features disc doesn't offer much, but has some neat stuff. Really though who could complain after a collection like this?",1308096000,,2190,4.559796437659033
2105018,5,B0002MHDYW,"This is an excellent set of movies despite the need for some restoration.  Unfortunately, The Cocoanuts suffers greatly from poor sound and picture quality, but the others are not too bad and the material speaks for itself.  The bonus materials are pretty slim and do not warrant an additional disk, but I bought it for the great Marx Bros. comedy and no disappointments there.

Boy am I glad I did. It arrived about 3 days after I hit the return button on my PC (used an amazon gift card that I received). After watching Maryland beat UNC in basketball, I put the Animal Crackers dvd into my player and did not stop laughing until the movie was over. I'll watch the rest of teh DVDs as time allows. In my opionion, the quality was no worse then when these movies re shown on tv. For me tastes this is fine. The sounds was perfectly acceptable. The vida was great (was were all of the gags).

Also, there is a very nice booklet included which gives a lot of great trivia and facts about the Marx brothers. For example, have you ever wondered why Zeppo stopped appearing in their films after the first five films? Have you ever wondered if Groucho thought a film of theirs might not make it?

Another great film to watch is Duck Soup. To me, it is the perennial Marx brothers film which shows the brothers at the top of their game. It truly showcases their talents and has several hilarious oneliners and also features another marvelous comedian, Edgar Kennedy.

Lastly, you will also see several marvelous interviews (Groucho, Harpo and Harpo's son) as well as some nice homes movies. If you are a old Marx brothers fan or someone who just wants to see great comedy, check out this collection.",1294790400,,1035,4.644808743169399

Paramount are classics of American comedy that stand the test of time. These are works
  of comic mastery few can even come close to matching.

  That said, Universal's indifferent packaging and unrestored prints are something of a
 scandal. ""Horsefeathers"" suffers the worse, and it's hard to imagine with effort a print
  with the badly mangled ""college widow"" scene couldn't be used to restore it.

  Overall, the extras are not worthy of the Marx's place in the comic pantheon.
  It's like they took the first stuff they could the rights to and stuck them on an
  extra disk. Actually, this could have been a two disc set with extras and no
  flippers.

2105043,5,B0002MHDYW,"You may have heard that this set has some serious flaws. That's right: only a few paltry special features - no commentary or documentaries like WB's Marx Brothers set has, films that are not remastered and up to current quality standards your average movie buff now expects, and there are some missing scenes in some of the movies - Well, that last bit is unavoidable. A few minutes from these films have been lost, but the other two are valid complaints.

But you should still buy this set, and I'll tell you why.

These are the funniest movies ever made.

Ever.

Don't listen to those who say that the first movie, The Cocoanuts, is no good. It is an early sound picture and pretty rough, and it does conatin a bit of lame musical padding (being adapted from the brothers' Broadways show, like their second film Animal Crackers), but Groucho, Chico, and Harpo are on top form and you'll laugh your 21st century butt off to these classic comedians, and the movies just get better from there, reaching a cresendo with the absurdist masterpeice Duck Soup.

These five films represent the Marxes at their peak, fresh off of the stage and still young-ish. When the Brothers went to MGM (chronicled in the other Marx DVD set from WB) they had to be less crazy and their films had to conatin male and female romantic interests for the brothers to assist - the thought being that some people in the audience won't care for watching a bunch of comedians and need a pair of ""young lovers"" to keep them interested. The first two of those films, A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races, have big budgets and are still very good, but after that the films became more like B-movies. Those films still had good parts in them, but are vastly inferior to the films included in this set, which are:

The Coaconuts

In which Groucho is a hotel manager for a failing Florida hotel and Harpo eats a telephone.

Animal Crackers

In which Groucho is Captain Spaulding, fresh from exploring the amazon, and Chico is a musician who charges a higher rate for not playing.

Monkey Business

In which the brothers are stowaways on a cruise ship and Groucho hides in a woman's closet.

Horse Feathers

In which Groucho becomes dean of Huxley College and the password is ""swordfish.""

Duck Soup

In which Groucho is leader of Freedonia, Harpo and Chico are spies, and war is declared by all.

The Marx Borthers are just pure joy and these films are to be watched again and again. I only hope that someday Universal gives these movies the proper remastering work and special features that they deserve.",1269129600,5,2577,4.5816993464052285

2105045,4,B0002MHDYW,"This set includes 5 good Marx Brothers comedies.
Duck Soup
Monkey Business
The Coconuts
Horse Feathers
Animal Crackers
All are good solid comedies, but in my opinion Duck Soup is far and away the best of the bunch.
The Marx Brothers humor is timeless. There is very little in any of these films that is terribly dated. You could take almost any
of the gags used in these films and put them in a modern comedy and it would still work just as well.
Matter of fact modern comedians could learn a lot from the old timers like the Marx Brothers, Laurel & Hardy, and Red Skelton.
Humor is difficult to do well, and good slapstick is probably the most difficult, but these guys were masters at it. Good gags
and jokes, good delivery, and good timing. It seems that so many modern comedians are lacking to some degree in all three of
them, but the old timers knew how to do it up right.",1263168000,,878,4.327272727272727

The picture quality and sound quality of ""Cocoanuts"" and ""Animal Crackers"" is very, very poor but in any case these haven't aged well over the years as I didn't find most of the films funny except for a few of Groucho's witty one-liners that were able to raise a chuckle or two from me.  Both picture and sound quality improve over the next 3 films but not by much though.  It seems to me that the quality of the films as well as the jokes improve from film to film and I liked ""Duck Soup"" the best although I note with interest that I thought every one of the Chaplin films even the silent ones aged better than any of the films here and I laughed a lot more watching those.  I guess few if any can match up to the genius that was Chaplin.  For example, nothing that Harpo did I found in the least bit funny after watching Chaplin who was undoubtedly the far far superior slapstick/mime comedian although I have to say I enjoyed Groucho's one-liners more and more as I went through the films resulting in his best work arriving in ""Duck Soup"".  I thought the last war scenes were the best Marx Brothers routines in this set.  If this trend of the films getting better with each subsequent release continues I guess I can expect a lot more from ""Night At the Opera"" and ""Day At the Races"" which I haven't yet watched but may yet get separately later.

The frustrating thing is that Marketing at Universal has done its job with a very well packaged set that opens up revealing all the discs with a nice 34-page booklet stuck to the centre spine; if only production did its job too with a quality product.  The last bonus disc is a rip-off and waste with less than a half hour of interviews only on it.  They could have saved the extra disc and put the content on the extra space on the 5 other discs.  A missed opportunity indeed and with the very poor quality reproductions and lack of any restoration I'd advise you either get the individual films properly re-done if/when they are released or should they decide to do the right thing and re-release this box set with the proper remastering done.

2105056,5,B0002MHDYW,"The history of the Marx Brothers is divided into two periods:  the early films that included Zeppo and the later ones without him.  While this later period offered a couple classics (A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races), it is the earlier movies that are generally recognized as the Brothers at their peak.  The Silver Screen Collection collects all five of these movies.

Of the four brothers, two are more-or-less the stars:  Groucho stands out the most as the master of verbal comedy, while the mute Harpo is skilled at physical comedy.  Chico is somewhere in the middle, typically acting as a partner-in-crime with Harpo, while Groucho usually assumes a leadership position, but he represents more anarchy than real authority.  Zeppo is, let's face it, the boring one, reasonably talented, but he is the straight man and his few solo scenes are not the highlights of the films.  And, of course, there is the ""fifth Marx Brother"": not Gummo but Margaret Dumont, who played the society dame who is Groucho's constant foil; Dumont is in three of the five movies (and would appear in later movies too).

The Cocoanuts is their first film and the weakest in this set.  Made in 1929, it suffers from the technical difficulties of the early talkies and also has a certain staginess (which makes sense, since it is an adaptation of a play).  As with most Marx Brothers movies, there is little in the way of real plot, just enough to tie the comedy (and musical) bits together.  What story there is follows Groucho as he tries to keep his hotel from failing.  Despite the flaws, this is still an entertaining movie, brightened by the wonderful comedy of Groucho, Chico and Harpo.

Chronologically next is Animal Crackers which has Groucho as a big game hunter returning from safari and being feted at a weekend party.  There are some shenanigans regarding a stolen painting and two forgeries.  Following this is Monkey Business, which has the brothers stowing away on a cruise ship and getting tangled up with gangsters and a kidnapping.

Horse Feathers has Groucho running a college; to keep the school going means winning the big football game.  This being a Marx Brothers movie, you know the game is going to have more antics than legitimate plays. Finally, Duck Soup - regarded by many as their best movie, though it was initially a commercial and critical failure - has Groucho running the European(?) nation of Freedonia, and Harpo and Chico as a pair of spies from a rival country.  Despite (or because of) Groucho's best efforts, things will descend into war, but in the Marx Brothers's world, things are never quiet on the Western (or any other) front.

This is all four-or-five star material.  For the fan who just wants to watch the movies, this is great stuff, but if you want any substantial extras, you won't find them.  While a sixth disc does offer some archival Today show footage, this totals less than half an hour.  But even if the cake has little icing, it is still delicious and even three-quarters of a century later, hasn't gotten the least bit stale.",1211673600,5,3078,4.7443609022556394

In the 1920's, The Marx Brothers ruled the Vaudeville circuit and sold out houses from coast to coast with their shows. They became a household name, and after paying their dues on the East Side of Manhattan and schlepping across the country on the show circuit, they made a move into film with anarchic style and joy. They earned it, and they pay it back to the audience with zeal.

The five movies that the boys did as The Marx Brothers for Paramount Pictures in the 1930's showcases a talent that has seldom been improved upon. Start off with The Cocoanuts, a vaudevillian dream-show that unreels as if you are sitting in an opera house and watching a live performance, without a trace of movie-tricks or special effects. The mania continues up to the jewel in the crown of the foursomes' oeuvre, the incomparable Duck Soup- a movie so wild, crazy, and nonsensical that any description short of simply calling it 'perfect' is unjust.

The Marx Brothers are hysterical. Groucho is the anchor that fires off one-liners and acts as lovably despicable as possible. Chico is a faux-Italian know-it-all with a love for wordplay and a sharp mind for cons and schemes. Harpo (this reviewers' personal favorite) is a brilliant musician and even more brilliant pantomimist. See if you can watch his joyful, superbly insane expression as he casually hangs his leg on the arm of anyone he stands next to without breaking into laughter yourself. He does it at least once in ever film, and every time he pulls it off it's funnier than the last. Rounding out the group was Zeppo, a straight man who plays off of the three monkeys and holds the plot together. He's The Glue, long before greats like Phil Hartman and Alan Arkin started doing their own work in the genre.

This collection is extraordinary. The pictures are as crisp and clean as one can ask for, considering the age of the source material. There is a natural bias against movies that are this old and weathered; ""If it's in black and white and is older than my grandfather, it must not be worth it"".

2105064,4,B0002MHDYW,"A new love of mine is the Marx Brothers.  Actually, I have known of them for a while, but haven't come to appreciate them till now.  I was introduced to them when I was 8 or 9 and it was through just one movie, Go West.  The movie is really not a great film and at times, it's not really a good film, but as a kid I loved certain parts of it, especially the stage coach scene in which the brothers and the passengers try to survive a bumpy carriage ride.  Really, the film has classic Groucho lines but they have to carry the movie more than they should.

Up until a few nights ago, I never really appreciated the Marx Brothers for their films outside what I remember from Go West and left it at that.  Then I happened across a documentary on PBS about the life of Groucho Marx and his rise, fall, and rise again in the Hollywood landscape.  It was fascinating and if you ever get a chance, I recommend you check it out to- it really is a good introduction to Groucho Marx and what type of person he was.  Anyway, a few nights later I saw the movie,  A Night at the Opera, was playing on TV and decided that this would be a great movie to watch while all this new found knowledge and appreciation for the Marx Brothers was swirling in my head.  I set my TiVO to record the program but ended up watching the whole thing in real time due to sheer interest and getting hooked into the film early.

The film tells the tale of one Otis P. Driftwood (Groucho) who plays a business manager of a wealthy woman (Groucho's long time straight madam Margaret Dumont) looking to become a well known name in New York's elite.  While in Europe, Driftwood arranges to have her place a rather large sum of money into the New York Opera which uses the money to pay a famous opera tenor, Rodollfo Lassparri (Walter King) to sing in their upcoming season in New York.  Lassparri has a thing for one of his female cast member who is in love with a younger and struggling tenor, and he uses his new found fame and wealth to bring her to New York to hopefully win her away from her young suitor all the while dealing with his dresser/lackey played by Harpo Marx and the young tenors cousin, played by Chico Marx.

The move is a seamless role of gags and one-liners that really never slows down except for a rather long musical number on a cruise ship.  The film is a classic for seeing Grouch at the top of his game and you begin to look forward to his scenes since he really has no joke that doesn't fall flat.  I did laugh out loud several times through out the movie and had steady chuckles the rest of the time.

It's a blast to watch the opening scene with Groucho and Margaret Dumont.  Their chemistry is undeniable and as the scene rolls, the background characters stop what they are doing and just sit a watch these two actors go back and forth verbally for the whole scene.  The film is filled with other memorable scenes (gags) such as people trying to get Harpo to talk (he was the silent one who communicated through sounds) or Groucho talking to large crowds of people while making them the subjects of the jokes he spews, and the classic stateroom scene- take my word for it, it is hilarious.  The final act, in the New York Opera House, is a great example of the physical comedy that Harpo and Chico were capable of and is fun to watch since it was all done in live action (remember this is before the days of CGI stunt men).  All in all a great film for families to watch together, there are plenty of jokes and sight gags for the kiddos and rants and raves of the Groucho and Chico for the adults.",1194998400,,3591,4.236070381231672

He is offered the chance to play the harp, but just uses it as a bow to shoot little toy arrows at a target. :( ) One with Groucho in his old age, and one with Harpo's son William (this one is the most interesting because he shares stories of his father and uncles and shows some home video clips) All of these clips are just a few minutes long and it makes you wonder why they even bothered adding an extra DVD just for the interviews.

Having read other customer reviews about how Universal ""slapped"" this set together, however, I was surprised how classy the presentation is on the surface. There is a nice booklet and an extras disc. What were they talking about? Well, the extras really are kind of lame. I mean, they are great, but they really have nothing to do with the films, and they are short -- just interview footage from much later. And truth be told, I didn't get any new information out of the booklet, either. So, if you are optimistic Universal will take another stab at this and invest more in remastering and providing extras that mean something, you might want to wait. I felt it was time for me to have these movies, and I couldn't find any evidence a new version would be forthcoming. I am not disappointed I bought this box set, which has some of the best comedies ever filmed. But Universal definitely did not go the extra mile.

2105077,5,B0002MHDYW,"I've always loved the five pre-code films of the Marx Brothers, and having them all together in this collection so that I can see any one or combination of them anytime I like is wonderful. ""The Cocoanuts"", their first film, was made in 1929. The Marx Brothers give a very atypically natural performance for a 1929 film, primarily because they were a vaudeville act prior to this and therefore had no experience working in the silent film era. ""The Cocoanuts"" and ""Animal Crackers"" feature musical performances from singers other than the Marx Brothers, but that changes in their last three Paramount films, with the brothers doing all of the musical performances themselves. Margaret Dumont, who played the society matron who is the object of some of Groucho's best jokes, doesn't appear in ""Monkey Business"" or ""Horse Feathers"" and her presence is missed. Most critics laud ""Duck Soup"" as the best of the Marx Brothers' films of this era, but my favorite has always been ""Animal Crackers"". I always thought it contained the best performances of any of the brothers - solo or in combination - of their pre-code films, and also that it had the most energy. ""Duck Soup"" is praised as a great political satire, and I love that film as much as the other Marx Brothers movies, but I think the boys got lucky on that one. The Marx Brothers' stock and trade were making fun of all kinds of so-called respectable institutions, so it would only make sense that they would get around to politics and war, as they did in ""Duck Soup"". The fact that it would be another 35 years after this film was made before Americans began to get quite cynical about their government's motivation in war in particular and overall competence in general just makes this movie look ahead of its time and underscores the Marx Brothers' comic genius, which is actually evident in all of their films.

The Marx Brothers had bigger hits than these early films, but I think I'll always prefer these pre-code classics. That is mainly because the Marx Brothers really needed an environment in which they could cut loose with their brand of outrageous comedy, without any worry of censorship, in order to do their best work. The only really disappointment in the set is in the extra features department. I guess I've been spoiled by the various Warner boxed sets that are chock full of goodies and extras, but it seems that Universal could have come up with more than a few trailers and three five minute interviews from the Today Show.

That set has lesser Marx Bros. films but great other stuff thrown in like cartoons and shorts. If only Warner Bros. had owned these films too. That said, here's my take on quality: For some reason, I'm an extreme stickler for quality sound in my audio purchases. I want my vinyl to be 180-gram, and my CDs to be 20-bit or better, but I'm more forgiving on picture quality on old films. I know they could look better and be restored, but it doesn't bother me that much watching here. I'm busy laughing. The sound quality, too, is good enough. It's not constricted, tinny and ruined. I don't know about a whopping used price, but this is a buy. And someone, please, wake up those idiots at Universal and let them know that a lot of people think the product they put on the market -- and yank off -- is inferior.

But -- and this is a big qualifier -- the so-called extras consist of some of the trailers and, on the ""bonus"" DVD, three vintage television interviews.

2105090,4,B0002MHDYW,"Like most of the reviewers here, I have good things and bad things to note about this collection.

The Good: My 7-year-old daughter loves to watch these films. She doesn't always catch the verbal play, but she really digs the sight gags. We've been watching these together since she received them for her birthday, and she's yet to tire of them. While I would prefer cleaner prints, I'm just glad to have these films -- history in a can, so to speak -- for my daughter to enjoy.

The Bad: By and large, the quality of these DVDs isn't that bad. Not great by any means, but serviceable. What I find particularly disheartening is the indifference of studios to the stars of their past -- the ones who made the studios relevant in the first place -- such that a ""bonus feature"" on this collection amounts to retro Today Show soundbites. The el-cheapo DVD of Chaplin's ""The Kid"" that I bought at Walgreen's had more bonus material on it, and that was just one disk in a plastic sleeve. This collection devotes one whole disk to bonus features for what...so we can remember how completely unattractive and aurally annoying Gene Shalitt was in the 70s? Pitiful.

I'd still recommend the collection because these films should be a standard in every library. But good bonus material provides context, and that context often engenders an appreciation for the films and their creators that can't be had from bios or period surveys.",1138665600,12,1421,4.698795180722891

In a world full of tragedy and sorrow, we will always owe a debt to those few among us can be counted on to make us laugh. I will always tip my hat to the Marx Brothers.  I don't want to leave out Zeppo as the straight man either!  Harpo without speaking, could convey his humor in sight gags.  With his expressive face, he could say so much, like Jim Carrey can today. Chico, the masterful pianist could also be counted on to deliver his lines perfectly.  Groucho, I will always remember as the consumate comedian.

2105092,3,B0002MHDYW,"The Marx Brothers were geniuses and their five Paramount films will forever be classics.  It is great to finally see these films again.  However, before I heap additional praise on the Marx Brothers, I have to throw some criticism in the direction of the DVD production.

Having previously purchased the beautifully restored Marx Brother's MGM film collection, I was disappointed by Universal's release of these vintage Paramount Marx classics.  It appears that very little was done to restore these films prior to their digital DVD impression.  Some of the films are still scratchy, occasionally jumpy, audio is difficult to hear (sounding as if you were listening to the movie with a soda can against your ear), and in the case of ANIMAL CRACKERS, the film is lacking crisp black and white contrast.

As for the special features DVD, I ask ""Why even bother.""  The special features amount to a couple minutes of very brief NBC today show interviews.  It seems as though Universal shoved the additional features DVD into the set to make it seem trendy.  Come on guys, you can do better than that.

The packaging is nice as the DVDs are contained an an accordian-style album.  It includes a small booklet about each of the films, though I think they could have afforded a little more verbiage about the movies and some of the behind the scenes activities.

Although the most finacially successful Marx films derived from their MGM days, the Paramount films are the zany Marx Brothers at their best.  Remember that the first Marx Brothers movies were filmed at Paramount's Long Island studios.  At various times the Marx Brothers would act in front of the camera by day and perform on Broadway at night.  In fact, the Marx Brother's first films were their stage comedies adapted for the screen.

One of the most appealing aspects of the original Paramount films is that the Marx Brothers' brand of craziness did not seem out of place in screenplays where their costars portrayed exaggerated characters anyway.  It is difficult to spot a looney in a world gone mad.  Even the movie sets looked like some sort of futuristic nightmare.  In many ways, the Paramount films could have been feature length Marx Brother cartoons.  These films are very different from the later RKO and MGM movies where the Marx Brothers were inserted into more conventional stories with believable romantic subplots.

Kudos for the long awaited release of these films along with an occasional grimace over the DVD transfer quality.",1127001600,8,2504,4.928400954653938
2105093,3,B0002MHDYW,"The Marx Brothers are the kings of the incredible wacky comedies, and these are 5 of their best 7 movies, with ""A Night At The Opera"" and ""A Day At The Races"" being the other two.  I could go on and on about how funny these movies are, but it would just be a repitition of the other reviews.  The three stars I rated this are an average of 5 for the movies and 1 for the quality.

My complaint is the quality of the movies.  It seems to me that there was no effort to restore any of these films, they just transfered what they had onto DVD.  There are splices from the masters that looses bits of dialogue, and I'm not counting the scene in ""Horse Feathers"" that was choppy due to the censorship of the day.  ""Cocoanuts"" used three or four masters that ranged in quality from good to poor, and several scenes go back and forth from the different masters.  Others in the set also used less than great masters although ""Cocoanus"" was the worst.  I ended up recording all five movies from Turner Classic Movies (a VERY class act) and putting them in the collection.

The 38 page booklet was great, but the 'bonus disc' was only three short interviews on the ""Today Show"" that are also poor quality.

These films and the memory of the Marx Brothers deserve much more.",1124841600,16,1263,4.313559322033898
2105094,5,B0002MHDYW,"For my money, this is as great as comedy gets. The movies themselves are not always perfect, but the great Marx Brothers skits contained within the films are my favorite comic moments in the history of cinema. Two DVD sets now contain all of the Marx Brothers films, but of the two, this one is clearly the one to get if you can only get one. All of the films in this set feature the Brothers at the height of their art, while the other set contains films in which they have either started to show their age or have begun to run out of ideas. Not one of these five films, however, is weak from a comic point of view, though the technical difficulties afflicting THE COCOANUTS can be a tad off putting. Some have stated a preference for the second set because it contains so many more special features, but only one movie in that second set withstands comparison with these five (A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, though A DAY AT THE RACES was also a strong film). I personally rarely watch special features more than once, while I watch the films themselves over and over. This set includes:

THE COCOANUTS (1929)

This is a fascinating translation of the Marx Brothers Broadway smash on to film, made in New York during their final Broadway success, ANIMAL CRACKERS. The skits are outstanding despite the fact that they are clearly learning how to bring their comedy to the screen. They learned quickly. For instance, on stage Harpo always wore a red wig, but his red wig in this film makes him look like a brunette. In subsequent films he wore a blonde wig instead, shifting back to a red wig for public appearances. This is probably the oldest sound film that is still widely watched. The limitations the primitive sound technology placed on the film are significant. For instance, they did not yet have a way of coordinating an orchestra track with a film track, so they literally had to film the dance numbers with an orchestra just off to the side of the stage. Also, the microphones were not terribly advanced. The voices always sound terrible, while they discovered that paper near the microphone crackled so much that it distracted from the performers. Notice the map in the famous ""Why a duck?"" skit. The reason it is so limp is they soaked it in water before filming so it wouldn't make so much noise. They had most of these initial sound problems solved by the time they made their next film.

ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930)

If it weren't for THE COCOANUTS, this would be one of the oldest frequently watched film that exists. I will not argue that this is their best movie, but it is the one that contains more of my favorite skits. Unfortunately, the subplot about stolen paintings keeps interrupting the Brothers' chaos. One absolutely stupendous skit after another, from Captain Spaulding's alternately absurd and bawdy remarks to Harpo and Chico showing Margaret Rutherford another way to play bridge.

MONKEY BUSINESS (1931)

Another early sound classic. This is in many ways one of the Brothers' funniest films, and the first half of the film, which takes place on an ocean liner, is as good as they got. Unfortunately, the second half slacks off just a bit. Still great, but the first half contains the best bits. One of two films with Thelma Todd instead of Margaret Dumont.

HORSEFEATHERS (1932)

Another stellar comic classic, Groucho plays a college president who recruits a couple of ringers (Chico and Harpo) for the school football team. The tragic Thelma Todd (her death remains the most spectacular unsolved crime in Hollywood history) plays the college widow. Contains perhaps fewer classic skits than the other four films in this collection, but still funnier than just about anything else ever made that didn't feature the Marx Brothers.

DUCK SOUP (1933)

Easily the best script the Brothers ever worked with, the folks with the studio finally realized that the romances and subplots simply distracted from what made the Marx Brothers films so great: the Brothers themselves. Margaret Dumont returns after having been away for a couple of films, and while Thelma Todd was superb, absolutely nothing surpasses the comic and romantic (?) interplay between Groucho and Dumont. Leo McCarey is arguably the best director they worked with, and the one who best seemed to understand what they were all about. By any standards, this is one of the great comic films ever made. I actually prefer the skits in ANIMAL CRACKERS, but this is clearly the stronger film of the two.

Over the years I've seen literally thousands of films of all kinds of genres (my great claim to fame in life is that I once won the Silver Screen edition of Trivia Pursuit on one turn, the first time I played it). I can point to the precise moment I because a serious movie fan. When in college I accidentally stumbled into a room where they were setting up a project to show a movie, and when the lights went out MONKEY BUSINESS appeared on the screen. Perhaps I would have gone on to be a film buff anyway, but I owe a special debt of gratitude to the Marx Brothers. If anyone has a passion, as I do for classic movies, one has to start somewhere, and these five films were precisely the films that first engendered my love for great films and comedy.",1124064000,10,5234,4.6720955483170465
2105102,4,B0002MHDYW,"This collection I bought on a whim not really being a Marx brothers fan. In the past I may have seen 1 or 2 of their films all the way through on television, but the quality of the sound and picture were poor, making it hard to understand some of the dialogue (which is where most of the humor lies, especially with Groucho). Since seeing these five movies with the improvement of digital mastering, I can truly consider myself a real Marx brothers fan, with a new appreciation of their higher level of humor that has up till now, been elusive. Groucho and Chico are particularly hillarious in their bantering verbal ""ping pong"" matches, and the double entendres from Groucho bring about some adult sexual connotations I've never picked up on before...Very very funny.",1123804800,,768,4.7388059701492535
2105103,5,B0002MHDYW,"I would like to clear up a misunderstanding about the sequence in Horsefeathers which has incited so much complaint concerning its ""choppiness"". The scene in Thelma Todd's bedroom was edited this way in the original version to comply with the obnoxious censorship requirements of the time. No subsequent restoration is possible since all the footage on the cutting room floor was thrown out with the garbage. Who would think anyone would ever consider these movies to be ""art""- at least what was thought back then. I do believe now that Universal did the best they could with these badly deteriorated prints.

2105104,4,B0002MHDYW,"All of these movies, with the possible exception of The Cocoanuts, which was too stagey for my liking, are absolutely wonderful pieces of film. Groucho is at his best and wittiest in Animal Crackers, Harpo and Chico as always have mesmerizing harp/piano solos thorughout, Harpo is at his comical best in Duck Soup, and Chico asks, ""Why a duck?"" in The Cocoanuts.

Also, the sound is improved on these DVD's. When I first watched these films on AMC, Harpo's harp solos sounded rather bad, but are restored quite well here.

My only qualm with these DVD's is that they are not restored enough. The scene in Horse Feathers in the college widow's room is choppy and quite badly edited. Also, the bonus features, which consist of one entire disc, are incredibly skimpy, consisisting of three brief Today Show interviews: one for Groucho, which they don't even show in its entirety, one for Harpo, and one for Harpo's son William. I was hoping for more extensive and interesting bonus features.

Here we go! First; picture quality is fine. Second; sound is slightly quieter than the VHS versions. Third; Horse Feathers choppy edits at the college widows place are an exact match to the VHS. This is just one of those unfortunate things that the footage at this time can never be fully restored. Fourth; these are the 5 great Marx films true Marxists love. Fifth; The first set put out by Warner Bros needed all those bonus features. This set doesn't.

2105109,2,B0002MHDYW,"These are arguably the five best of ""the boys'"" films.  Unfortunately, these are also five of the worse copies of  their films.  The first film (THE COCONUTS, 1929) is not watchable!  Looks like the original source material was a tenth-generation 16mm.  As we more forward in time (ANIMAL CRACKERS, etc) , the video gets marginally better, but still remains pretty poor.  Much better copies have been previously released on laser disk and VHS.  Perhaps what we have here is a lack of pride of ownership-Universal released this thing, but Paramount (on the East Coast) was where the films were shot.  There are six discs.  Disc number six is called BONUS MATERIALS which is far from a bonus unless you are satisfied with three brief chats from old TV shows with a total duration of less than 30 minutes.  Disc six seems to be there for packaging symmetry!  Bottom line:  if you love the Marx Brothers, wait for the blue-laser releases in a year or two.  Or try to find copies on laser disk or VHS.

2105110,4,B0002MHDYW,"Like many Marx Brothers fans, I waited for some time for a box set of their first five films made for Paramount from 1929 to 1933.  Happily, this set was released and provides long-suffering fans a set that offers mostly satisfactory results.

The films themselves are the highlights of the set.  There's ""The Cocoanuts,"" their first release from 1929.  While dated by today's standards, there is enough humor from the brothers to offset the bland and uninteresting supporting cast (save for the always excellent Margaret Dumont).  One complaint about the DVD for this film is the constant change in clarity and sound quality.  One scene will be crisp and clear; another will be fuzzy and murky.  This happens several times throughout the DVD, and the film is in obvious need of a full restoration.  This haphazard approach makes it difficult for the viewer to fully relax and enjoy the film.  Most Marx Brothers fans will be delighted; the casual viewer will see this early talkie mostly as a curio.

""Animal Crackers"" from 1930 offers a change in quality as far as the DVD goes.  Most of the film is consistent in shading and light, although there are still some glitches that could have been digitally improved.  Of course, the film is seventy-five years old to begin with, so most fans should be satisfied with this DVD.

""Monkey Business"" is the first Marx Brothers film to be written especially for a movie (the first two were from their Broadway shows).  The four brothers cavort and wreak havoc onboard a liner with happy results.  The DVD quality is very good.

""Horse Feathers"" has some scratches and hisses, and a few dialogue breaks.  Some of the film probably has been missing for decades.  Still, most fans will be happy with this DVD in the set.

""Duck Soup"" is the final film in the box set and perhaps the most popular.  The film showcases the brothers at their anarchial best.  The DVD is fairly crisp and clean.

An extra disc reveals the mediocrity of the package.  It is only twenty minutes long and has a few ""Today"" show interviews.  Surely, with all the appearances of the brothers on TV, a longer bonus DVD could have been released.  In addition, a film historian's persepective of the brothers' influence on film comedy would have been welcome.  The ""extras"" on this DVD could have fitted quite easily on one of the other discs.

A booklet is also included, but it does not divulge any new information; it seems to be aimed more at younger film audiences who don't know the Marx Brothers well.  There is no solid exposition in the booklet to merit repeated readings.

I give this set four stars for the indispensible films.  Perhaps a better package, with the films remastered, will be available in a few years.",1107043200,6,2737,4.725158562367865
2105111,3,B0002MHDYW,"If you're reading this review, you are probably already a Marx Brothers fan. As such, any description of their five Paramount films or the four brothers' comedic style is unnecessary. You probably also want to replace your battered VHS copies of these films with nice shiny DVDs.

If you buy this set, you will get DVDs that look about as good as your VHS's. That should satisfy you if it is all you are looking for, and you have money to burn. You may stop reading and ignore my critique. If you're looking for something more, or are on a budget however, there's no way I can recommend this without several qualifications. Bear in mind that I love the Marxes as much as anyone.

Firstly, there's no restoration work done on these films. To be honest, ""Coconuts"" and ""Horse Feathers"" have deteriorated to such a degree that restoration is probably next to impossible. But work could be done on the remaining three movies. I'm not asking for the unreasonable, such as 5.1 surround sound or the inclusion of deleted scenes. I'm simply asking for the pops and crackles on the soundtrack to be reduced and for some work to be done on improving the contrast and toning of the existing black and white images.

Secondly, at this price, where are the extras? True, all the actors who appeared in these films are long dead, along with the writers and producers. But that didn't stop Warner Brothers from adding commentary tracks to ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"" for their boxed set. Are there no film critics or comedy writers willing to contribute their talents here? Even Frank Ferrante - who is the only Groucho impersonator authorized by Groucho's heirs and the star of a successful one-man Groucho show - would be welcome here, to share his insights. I don't expect deleted scenes or outtakes but, again, Warner Brothers made up for this by including short subjects and cartoons to sweeten the package. Universal chose not to. I'm sorry, but 20 minutes worth of Today Show interviews and a few coming attractions doesn't qualify.

Finally, is there any reason to spread five films (three of  which are little more than an hour) over six DVDs? When Universal released their Abbott and Costello films on DVDs, they packed several short feature films on each DVD. Abbott and Costello are also black and white movies, and similarly feature mono sound. If you are going to skimp on the extras, then release these movies as a 3 DVD set at a lower price, so that the consumer gets what he or she paid for.

Its ironic that the Warners set, which features inferior movies, should not only be a better bargain but also more thoughtfully constructed. Universal did the right thing with their Monster Movie rereleases, featuring reasonably priced packages that were intelligently and caringly selected. This one, despite its lavish booklet, can't compare.",1106784000,16,2859,4.765656565656566
2105112,4,B0002MHDYW,"It's great to have the Marx Brothers' complete film collection available now in two boxed sets.  This Universal release contains their first five films and a bonus disc.  It took three movies for the brothers to really hit their stride:

""The Cocoanuts"" has its moments but  suffers a bit from staginess and the limits of early talking-film technology.  Still, it sets up the classic Marxian anarchy and comedy bits, like the wordplay between Groucho and Chico in the ""Why a Duck?"" routine. ***

  ""Animal Crackers"" is an improvement, but contains a little too much silly subplot around a stolen painting, and scenes we endure just to wait for the brothers to show up.  The musical numbers with Groucho as ""Captain Spaulding"" are fun (""Hooray for Captain Spaulding"" would become Groucho's theme song).***1/2

 In ""Monkey Business"", they create havoc as stowaways on a cruise ship, and the film is chock-full of very funny scenes, including the ""Maurice Chevalier"" bit and Harpo's hilarious encounter with a puppet show.  It's also the first of two films featuring blonde bombshell Thelma Todd, and her scenes with Groucho are brimming with innuendo. ****

  ""Horse Feathers"", set on the campus of fictitious Huxley College, is even better, with Groucho as a college president.  The ""speakeasy"" scene is one of many highlights. ****1/2

 And finally, there's ""Duck Soup"", their satiric masterpiece, a scathingly funny send-up of diplomacy and war.  Whenever I see the musical number ""We're Gonna Go to War"", I can't help thinking of a certain current administration.  And the ""mirror sequence"" with Groucho and Harpo is one of the funniest and most brilliantly-choreographed scenes ever put  on film. *****

The boxed set comes as a handsome fold-out package with a booklet which doesn't contain much background information.  And the bonus disc is very skimpy, containing only three 5-to-10-minute video clips featuring Groucho, Harpo, and son William Marx on old ""Today"" shows.  These could have easily been included on any of the other discs, but more bonus material would have been nice.  Also, the prints used are choppy at times, especially one scene in ""Horse Feathers"" which is so cut-up that it is almost unwatchable.  Maybe it's due to lost footage, but according to other reviewers, there have been better prints available elsewhere.  So this set is definitely worth getting, especially if you're a ""Marxist"" like me, though Universal could have put more work into producing a better package.",1106697600,7,2501,5.141439205955335
2105113,4,B0002MHDYW,"First let me add to the chorus that these five films are all classics.  Other than ""A Night At The Opera"", the Marx Brothers were never again to reach such heights.

As for the DVD set itself, it is certainly welcome and the graphic artist who designed the package did a fabulous job.  It looks splendid!

But as mentioned countless times, the discs themselves contain only the films (sometimes from inferior prints or poorly mastered), trailers but nothing else(except for the paltry but still enjoyable twenty minutes on an extra disc).  The booklet is ok but pretty flimsy.

Despite some legitimate complaints, most of these prints are very watchable.

With one major exception.

Below is an email I just fired off to Universal Studios:

""re: Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection

I purchased this item via Amazon.com recently.  This handsomely packaged set is certainly not perfect but it is largely fine.

HOWEVER, I am very unhappy with the print used for the film HORSE FEATHERS.

There is a five minute sequence about half way through (i.e. scene with the Marx's in Thelma Todd's apartment) that is chopped up, diced up, scratched, unwatchable and absolutely appalling!  I previously had MCA's VHS release of HORSE FEATHERS (which I stupidly gave away upon buying this DVD set) and NONE of this damage was on the print.  The splices, missing dialogue, grainy image, and horrendous quality during this five minute sequence is INEXCUSABLE.  This is the type of low quality product more usually associated with bargain basement companies that put out cheap public domain prints.  NOT the work of a major company like Universal.

I certainly expect that UNIVERSAL will be remastering HORSE FEATHERS from a superior print for the DVD set as a FREE REPLACEMENT COPY for its customers.  No doubt there are other  complaints to made about this set but the problems I mention about HORSE FEATHERS are really unacceptable and should be rectified.

Otherwise this customer(and no doubt others) will certainly avoid purchasing Universal products in the future.

I should also mention a similar instance in the past few years that I purchased a badly mastered CD from Blue Note Records (Bobby Hutcherson's ""Dialogue"").  That company immediately sought to rectify the situation and remastered the CD from superior materials and sent out replacement copiees to its thousands of loyal customers.

I should expect nothing less from Universal.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.""",1105574400,24,2482,5.099255583126551
2105114,2,B0002MHDYW,"Apart from the Universal horror classics, MCA Home Video cares little about its vintage film library. Why else would they release this slapdash DVD collection of the Marx Brothers' finest films. The ""extras"" are pathetic and the long-awaited restoration is nonexistent - especially on ""Horse Feathers"" (1932), which remains incomplete. If MCA had any integrity, they would recall this overpriced set and start from scratch.",1105142400,16,423,5.523076923076923
2105115,3,B0002MHDYW,"The first five Marx Brothers Films, unavailable for over ten years, are among the best comedies ever put on celluloid. They are also the only five films to feature four Marx Brothers, as Zeppo left to pursue other interests after the box office failure of ""Duck Soup."" (He was actually a ""replacement"" brother - eldest brother Gummo had been the straight man in the brothers' vaudeville act, but he left before they started making films to start a theatrical agency, and eventually, Zeppo joined him in this venture for a time.)

The films themselves stand up quite well, but no attempt has been made to improve either the picture quality or the sound. In fact, if you don't have a decent equalizer on your home entertainment system, you may find it very difficult to understand much of the dialogue on some of these discs, especially on their first film, ""The Cocoanuts.""

There are no commentary tracks, and the only extras are three brief vintage interviews, which I still can't believe they put on a disc by themselves. The entire set could easily have fit on three DVD's, rather than the six they released it on. The packaging is lavish, but the book sheds little light on the films.

I love these films, and feel they truly deserve a better treatment by Paramount - or whoever designed and mastered this package. I gave 3 stars because the films deserve 5, but the DVD set deserves zero.",1104796800,12,1393,4.677551020408163
2105116,4,B0002MHDYW,"If you are a Marx Brothers fanatic who does not own a copy of their Paramount comedies on DVD, you do not need to read another amateur reviewer's opinion on their movies. For you, the only caveat about this collection is that it has no background material, and contains a worthless ""special feature"" disk consisting of mindless interviews on the Today Show. Clearly, the producers of this disk were not interested in providing useful new information about the Marxs' films and careers, and I was somewhat turned off by this.

On the other hand, if for any reason you're not sure whether you want to invest in this collection, here is one person's opinion on these films. First, I think the Paramount films represent their best work. By the time they produced ""Night at the Opera"" for MGM in 1935, they were reusing story formulas from the Paramount movies with mostly inferior writing. The typical Marx brother formula consists of Groucho in some undeserved position of authority (hotel manager, president of a country, college president), Chico and Harpo playing impostors of some sort, creating havoc for everyone, and Zeppo, the only bit player ever to receive star billing in a film.  They are also typically surrounded by folks who take themselves too seriously -- the best example being Margaret Dumont -- and a couple in love is sometimes thrown in in order to bring some relief from the chaos.

The 5 Paramount films fall into two groups: the first two, which were cinematic renderings of their stage musical comedies, and their last three, original stories made only for movies. Although the Hollywood movies had the advantages of improvements in sound technology by 1931 as well as a less ""stagey"" look and feel by not being stage adaptations, I find the stage adaptations (Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers) to be their best work. Perhaps it was the biting wit of George F. Kaufman that made the difference, perhaps it was the fact that they had over a year of rehearsing each one on stage that sharpened their deliveries, but these films are remarkable accomplishments, and are in my mind the best of the box.

The Cocoanuts features Groucho at his wittiest as a hotel manager in 1920s Florida, and contains some of the best encounters with his brothers. The funniest starts when Chico utters those immortal words ""Alright, why a duck?"" Chico's clueless but arrogant demeanor at trying to cope with language is completely believable and shows how flawless Chico could be with good material. Groucho pauses before responding, no doubt to wait for the laughter to die down, but it also conveys his disbelief at hearing anyone utter such a question. Their exchange is comic acting refined to perfection. The banquet scene, where Harpo, unable to cope with the sequence of lame speeches, hunches his shoulders, grits his teeth, and staggers to the punch bowl, is also flawlessly executed.

The formula is repeated in Animal Crackers, with slightly better execution, better music and a slightly more digestible ""romantic couple"". The interplay between Groucho and Margaret Dumont, whose inability to grasp the brothers' anarchy makes her a perfect foil for their antics, is one of the constant highlights of this movie.

Monkey Business strays from the Marx formula by not putting Groucho in some position of authority, which rids him of a primary source of his humor.  Some of the visual sequences are also becoming stale, as in the scene in which the brothers take a stab at imitating Maurice Chevalier.  Harpo's best scene is in a punch-and-judy show. Horse Feathers is a slight improvement, with humor emerging from their parody of college life. Duck Soup is perhaps the most polished of these films (direction by Leo McCarey) but by now many of the visual gags are forced, as  when Chico and Harpo attack Edgar Kennedy's Lemonade stand. The final scenes of the last 3 films devolve into some form of anarchy, and are not completely satisfying.

On the whole however, for fans of classic film comedy, there is much to gain from owning this collection.",1104451200,3,4058,4.919590643274854
2105117,1,B0002MHDYW,"I received the set for Christmas...being an avid Marx Brothers fan, I was appalled. The sound quality was awful...very muffled and many times not even understandable. The films were chopped up, I thought commercials were coming up. The worst part is that parts of the picture at the bottom were chopped off, some of the best parts were no longer there. I have these on VHS that I recorded from TV and the VHS recordings are better than these DVD's. At least the VHS has all the scenes and the bottoms of the screens are there. From now on, I will read these reviews before purchasing or asking for something for Christmas. Everyone who bought this should get a replacement with the films fixed.",1104451200,62,694,4.604838709677419
2105118,2,B0002MHDYW,"Universal's ""The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection"" gathers Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo's first five films: The Cocoanuts, Animal Crackers, Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup. All of them are fantastically funny films, with the brothers in fantastic comic form. There is a loose, improvisational feeling to these films that is lacking from their later work, and the good feeling exhibited by them is downright infectuous. The weakest, the stagy and awkwardly paced ""The Cocoanuts,"" still has many great moments, and the best, ""Duck Soup,"" is a hilarious political satire that holds its own against the best movies ever made.
The high quality of these movies makes the incredible lacklustre boxed set a great disappointment. The image quality is mediocre at best, with tinny sound, blurry picture, scratches, vertical lines, and heavy grain. While it's true that some of these problems are due to poor source material (particularly in the case of ""The Cocoanuts""), they're practically inexcusable in ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Duck Soup."" Obviously no restoration whatsoever was made to these films.
The biggest disappointment is in the extras, or lack therof. The ""entire bonus disc of additional materials"" amounts to nothing more than three short ""Today Show"" interviews with Harpo (in mime), Groucho, and William Marx, Harp's son. While the interviews are amusing, their combined running time is less than twenty minutes and hardly qualify for an extra disc. Also scattered amond the individual discs are trailers for ""Animal Crackers,"" ""Horse Feathers,"" and ""Duck Soup."" Films of such high regard cry out for documentaries and commentaries similar to the ones on Warner Brothers' other Marx Brothers set.
One nice thing about the set is its packaging, which is handsome and elegant (although perhaps too elegant...something the brothers might have mocked in one of their films). With the packaging is a 40-page booklet, a large chunk of which is made up of mundane things like the chapter listings for each film. The historical information in the booklet is perfectly adequate, but hardly as ""spectacular"" as the box claims.",1104105600,,2145,5.330383480825959
2105119,3,B0002MHDYW,"I must agree with the other user reviews out there.

If you are looking for restored prints, remixed sound, commentary, bonuses or special material its not here. The films themselves look as good as when I first bought them on VHS some 15 years ago. It seems that Universal tried to cash in on the other MB set (which has TONS of great footage and look fantastic) and released this as an afterthought. My expectations were high and thats why I gave the -set- a 3-star rating.

I suspect that somewhere in the future, like the next wave of HD-DVD or Blu-ray these films might get the treatment they deserve, but I won't count on it. Universal seems to not care much about the quality of thier discs (other releases have had thier share of problems and disaponiments as well).

The films themseles are great. If you don't have the Marxes in your collection or missed the initial release of the DVDs, then this would be a fine purchase.

Die hard fans might want to wait until this set hits the bargain bin, or for the next edition to surface.",1102896000,20,1040,4.457894736842105
2105120,4,B0002MHDYW,"Like a lot of other people have already said, there's just not enough bonus material on here. The one disc with bonus stuff is incredibly short. The Warner Bros. Marx collection that came out earlier this year offered a lot more to the fans.

Having complained about that, now I've got to rave about the movies. These are sooooo good - each one of them are comedy classics. A lot of people make jokes about Zeppo, but The Marx Brothers' movies with him were better than most of the ones without him. (Almost all of the non-Zeppo movies ended up having Zeppoish ""straight man characters"" anyway.)

If you're a Marx Brothers fan, you can't go wrong by getting this collection. You'll laugh a LOT at the hilarious movies. Just don't expect a whole lot of bonus materials.",1102809600,8,768,4.598540145985401
2105121,2,B0002MHDYW,"I have been an ardant, if not fanatical fan, of the Marx Brothers. I have been a ""fan"" of so many pre-1950's films, when plot and character development, lighting, brilliant composition which were characters in and of themselves also made these films great when compared to the CGI glitz of plotless celluloid.

I have been very excited that so many of the ""GREAT"" films have been meticulously restored, not just ""re-mastered"" (a fancy name for a lot of glitzy box designs and extra pages of information about the actors/comedians, and their directors/producers, timelines in the evolution of great film making or whatever trivia they can fill in 2nd rate DVD releases of many films of this era which demand only the highest of restoration.

I would rather purchase beautiful visual and audio restorations of The Greatest of the Marx Brothers films in a brown box with simple Black Lettering than constantly be teased by yet another slightly better copy of such classics.

YES many films have been gloriously Restored by some reputable companies and Universities (UCLA just came out with the complete Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone of course) series full and meticulously restored to the look of an opening night presentation.

And there are many others as well: Universal has done Hitchcock films DAMN right.  The beautiful Restoration of Vertigo and Birds and Rear Window gave me insights into the true use of color that was so vital to the mystery and tension of Hitchcock's concepts as one of the greatest film makers..

So why can't we finally get such TRUE RESTORATIONS worth our money from the Marx Brothers Classics and STOP having to keep trying to buy the next ""effort"" at producing the TRUE Restoration these films deserve for as long as the term Archival has come to mean in this rather interesting age of potential global catastrophe.",1101859200,51,1847,4.961165048543689
2105142,1,B0002MHDYW,"A few years ago the Marx Bros. first five movies came to DVD through Image Entertainment. When I heard the Universal was releasing them in a high-priced, seemingly ""deluxe"" collection, I was overjoyed. The five films would surely be restored, and a sixth bonus disc of extras would be something to treasure.

It didn't work out that way.

The films have NOT been restored. A few of the transfers are marginally better than the Image versions, and the ""bonus disc"" consists of three TODAY show interviews that total 15 minutes.

Compare this half-baked effort to the gorgeous set that Warner Brothers released earlier this year with restored transfers of 7 films with tons of extras, for the same exact price. (Not to mention that the WB collection contains the Marx's two greatest films A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and a DAY AT THE RACES).

Seems like Universal was caught with their pants down, ignoring the Marx potential, seeing the huge success of the other collection, and rushed something into the marketplace that is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT to anyone who is (like me) a die-hard Marx fan.

I'm giving this to a friend, and keeping my Image DVDs. This new Universal collection is such a missed opportunity. What a shame!",1101600000,65,1217,4.803827751196172
2105143,5,B0002MHDYW,"As a huge Marx Brothers fan I ordered this set as soon as it became available. It has five Marx Brothers' classics - the Zeppo era, as well as a disk of bonus material. What impresses me most about the collection is the wonderful packaging the disks came in. Beautiful slipcover to hold the disks and the booklet that is incuded. While the booklet isn't very informative it does have the movie posters for the films (which is a nice treat). There are no commentaries or extras for the movies themselves, but since the people involved in the films are no longer with us this is no surprise.
  What will draw the true fans to buy the collection are the movies themselves. While you should be forewarned the quality of the film transfer and audio are poor by today's standards, it is quite understandable considering the age of these films. Duck Soup is my favourite Marx Brtoher's film of all time and Monkey Business and Animal Crackers are also must sees.",1101254400,5,955,4.578947368421052

Next time you see the three films she is in just watch her expressions and put Groucho and his dialogue out of your mind. She simply cracks you up by just looking. This is especially true with Animal Crackers. She was simply the greatest foil in motion pictures and really makes these films classics. She was an actress for the ages.,1101254400,5,429,4.512820512820513
2105145,4,B0002MHDYW,"OK, so Universal seems to have dropped the ball on this set.  The extras are sorely lacking.  But the films look and sound pretty good for their age, and I doubt anything short of an expensive restoration would improve them.  Unfortunately, some of the missing footage (like one of Groucho's lines in the opening song of ""Animal Crackers"" and a few Hays code edited hijinks from Harpo in ""Horse Feathers"") are considered lost forever.  The films remain the Marx Brothers' best, however, so don't hesitate buying this set for the movies:

""The Coconuts""- This films suffers from extreme staginess and poor sound technology, which makes sense since it was one of the first sound films.  The brothers when on screen are still hysterical, but they don't seem to have quite as much screen time as usual.  Most consider the ""viaduct"" routine to be the classic bit from this one. (3 of 5)

""Animal Crackers""- While ""Animal Crackers"" still feels like a play (which it was), the technical side seems a lot smoother.  The story involves a missing painting at a high society party, but it fortunately doesn't matter.  Groucho is Captain Spaulding, the African explorer, and proceeds to insult his host repeatedly bith directly and in soliloquy.  Harpo, while funny as always, is a little disturbing in this one as the theiving professor.  The film is a little long, but contains great bits like Harpo and Chico's bridge game, and Groucho and Chico's insanity-inducing attempts to solve the mystery.  (4 out of 5)

""Monkey Business""-  This one finally gets out of stage mode as this was the Marxes' first Hollywood production.  The brothers are stowaways on an ocean liner.  During the course of the picture, the brothers provide interesting insights on the barber trade, hiding from the authorities, and doing a Maurice Chevelier (sp?) impersonation.  (4 out 5)

""Horse Feathers""- The start of the Marx Brother's peak (along with ""Duck Soup"" and ""A Night at the Opera"").  Groucho is the dean of a small college who is soon to play a football game against their long term rival.  But who cares about a plot when you've got songs like ""I'm Against It"" and the swordfish routine.  Margaret Dumont, the quintessential Marxist foil, is unfortunately AWOL for this film (and Monkey Business), but Thelma Todd fills in quite well.  And besides, she's more fun to look at. (5 out of 5)

""Duck Soup""- Very likely the funniest film of all time.  Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, the new ruler of Freedonia.  After putting down his iron fist, he begins to pick a war with the neighboring country.  Chico (as ""Chicalini"") and Harpo are extremely poor spies trying to keep track of Firefly.  This film really does provide intelligent non-stop laughs.  For better or for worse, it remains as timely as ever with its war setting.  High points include ""Hail, Hail Freedonia,"" and the mirror sequence.  I've always had a strong affinity for Firefly's cabinet meeting too.  (5 out of 5)",1101168000,34,2953,4.855711422845691
2105146,5,B0002MHDYW,"While the set isn't perfect, the new video transfers for all of the films but Animal Crackers are wonderful. They have beautiful photographic quality for the most part, even when the 16mm or dupe material is in The Cocoanuts. Universal really did a nice job of translating such tricky film elements into nice video. Animal Crackers has not been remastered like the other 4 films, oddly. It's interlaced, although, it still looks very good. It doesn't have the level of clarity and detail the other 4 films have.

Supplements aren't great like Warner's set. I really wish Universal included commentaries for the films and even some shorts (like their Walter Lantz cartoons and other short subjects). But the films are so good, it's still worth it.",1100649600,6,746,4.920634920634921
2105147,4,B0002MHDYW,"In summary, I will echo what's been said already about this collection.  The films are worth having, because after 70+ years of existence, this is apparently the best Universal will do with the classic Marx Brothers performances of their day.

Now I will heap on some gripes of my own.  First, there's just over six hours of material spread over six DVDs.  You do the math--they're obviously NOT TRYING VERY HARD here.  They could have easily fit this all on 3 discs, or fewer.  It's not like there's a COMMENTARY TRACK or even a RESTORED PRINT that would make each film worthy of its own disc.  Universal did the BARE MINIMUM knowing that real fans would buy these crappy prints anyway, and will pay again if they release restored and augmented versions later.  (The Warner Collection beats this one hands down, but with different titles.  Hell, even Universal's treatment of ABBOTT & COSTELLO was done better.)

The ""exclusive book"" is fluff; it has credits and pictures but NOTHING you can't get elsewhere (like IMDB).  And the ""extras"" disc is pitiful.  The Today Show interviews of Harpo and Groucho are so brief, and in need of restoration themselves, they're actually cruel to watch.  C'mon Universal, this is the BEST STUFF you could find?  It's not like you were limited to supplemental material from the 1930s.  These interviews are from the '60s and '70s!

The only thing that remotely redeems this collection is the price--the Amazon price, not the retail price.  Buy this for the movies if you love them, but this is a collection that ONLY MINNIE (the Marx Brothers' mother) should love.",1100563200,127,1600,4.823529411764706
2105148,4,B0002MHDYW,"I have to agree with most of the reviewers that this compilation is a disappointment.  Given the Marx Brothers status in cinematic history they deserved a better treatment from Universal than this cynical release.  The prints are shoddy, the accompanying booklet, though full of nice glossies, is thin on text, and the extras are miniscule.  Even the packaging smells funny.  That leaves us with the films themselves.  A constant through all five of these films are the brothers impeccable timing and their sense of comic anarchy.  What is also apparent, in some of the films, are weak stories and wooden acting by the supporting cast(and Zeppo).  It's through the shear comic abilities of the Marxes that they were able to transcend these liabilities and have films that are enjoyed generations later.

The Cocoanuts: It's apparent this film's stage origins because it feels, well, stagey.  That said, it has a certain ragged charm as the boys first endeavor in a medium that was still in it's infancy, the talking picture.  Four stars.

Animal Crackers:  This film suffers from the same staginess as ""The Cocoanuts"" but is slicker and does not have the charm of the first film.  Three stars.

Monkey Business:  The laughs are more constant in this one but most of them are derived from the boys' shipboard misadventures.  When the film reaches land and a clunky gangster story is introduced the film goes a little awry.  Four stars.

Horse Feathers:  The laughs increase but there is a definite missed opportunity here.  Considering the film's college setting there should have been shots taken at academia and college life in general.  Most of the film concerns itself with a football game.  Four stars.

Duck Soup:  Now we're cooking with gas.  Pointed political satire with better story, acting(Louis Calhern, Edgar Kennedy), and more memorable set pieces.  Five stars.",1100563200,12,1874,5.042483660130719
2105149,3,B0002MHDYW,"I'm disappointed with this collection.

It is standard practice these days to at least reconstruct older films so that they contain all the original footage.  ""Horsefeathers"" is so choppy in places I feel as though I'm watching a worn out 16mm film print from the 1960s.

In fact, the prints in general are scratchy or washed out, and the audio is mixed poorly.  I need to raise or lower the volume on my stereo from one DVD to the next!

And the promised material, including a 40 page booklet, is underwhelming.  The booklet could have conatined essays on the films, but instead barely contains a few anecdotes.  I knew there were limiited bonus materials, but as other people have mentioned, the brief interviews included (and no commentary) are NOT an incentive to buy these discs.

I love ""Duck Soup"" and ""Monkey Business,"" and I'm glad I can watch them over and over.  But these DVDs are no better than my old VHS dubs off TV.

I'll think twice before I buy any Universal DVDs of older films.",1100563200,8,997,4.581920903954802

The packaging is elegant, which he would have loved, but abhorring superficiality, he would have been railing creative obscenities at the lack of care given to his legacy and our enjoyment.

The lack of restoration, lack of commentary, minimal and disappointing extras, and ""collectible 40 page booklet"" which must have taken at least a half-hour to write (though much longer to lay-out..the graphic designer clearly cared) leaves me wondering if Universal has contempt for both its customers and its product.

This is not the first Universal release which has left me feeling this way, and it is one of the reasons I own so few of their discs.",1100476800,12,735,4.959349593495935
2105151,1,B0002MHDYW,"Dear God, what a disappointment!!!!  I'm disappointed with the set, not the movies (the funniest films of all time)....

First of all, why weren't the movies restored properly?  I have the Image DVD versions and they look absolutely the SAME!  I cannot believe, in this day and age, that those movies couldn't be restored.  For example, I have Harold Lloyd's ""Slapstick Symposium"" (which features shorts from the 1919-1922 period), on DVD, and these films are SEVEN TO ELEVEN YEARS OLDER than the Marxes' first film, ""The Cocoanuts"" (1929).  The restoration is SUPERB and those films look better than ""Cocoanuts""!

What really gets me about ""Cocoanuts"" is that you can see exactly where the ""dupe copy"" takes over from the original print.  You can't tell me there was no way to take care of this problem with today's technology......UGH.

Also, there is the glaring omission of restoration on ""Horse Feathers"".  The scene in Thelma Todd's bedroom still looks like CRAP......I'm going to assume all the footage that was originally cut from the movie is lost forever. You can still see the jumps in the film, it doesn't look like Universal even took the time to try to recify this problem. Or cared.

It's stuff like this that makes you realize that Universal only cares about how much money THEY make instead of doing the RIGHT thing and putting money into restoring the movies to their original comic glory.

It really bugs me that these films are not being recognized as the gems they are. The overall quality of the prints is mediocre for a DVD release.  Take a look at the Warners' set, and you will see what I mean. You would have thought after the complaints from fans over the Image DVD versions Universal would have been on the ball and taken great care to restore these films.

Why do they even bother having these films in their catalog if they don't care to make them the best quality possible?

The 40-page booklet is not a very distinguishing review of the brothers' career and the ""bonus disc"" is a major rip-off!  15 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE?  You have got to be kidding.....no other fillers, nothing.  They might have as well skipped the 6th disc all together.

Still, I love these movies despite the problems.  These are the five movies that made the Marxes LEGENDS, and you would think Universal would recognize this. We Marxists deserve better and so don't The Marxes.

I'm sure if Groucho were here today he'd have a comment for Universal's shabby treatment of the movies as well: ""I'd horsewhip you, if I had a horse"".

This Devoted Marxist is not feeling any ""Love Happier"" with this release.....

P.S. 11-18-04: I just wanted to add to my review that I went to Universal's website and complained about the movies through their ""Contact Us"" page.  I suggest all fans disappointed with this release do the same.  I did receive an e-mail back from Universal that they have sent my e-mail on to the ""appropriate department"" We'll see what happens.....",1100476800,48,2963,4.762745098039216
2105152,4,B0002MHDYW,"Oh, what a nice 40th Birthday present I received!

This set is so cool. I agree though that the film to DVD transfers don't look so great, but I'm thinking that considering how old these films are, we're lucky to see them on DVD at all!

 I didn't know that they had already been on DVD in 2000?

I'm so glad Universal Studios, the owner of the films has reissued them for DVD, so that they are preserved for future generations to enjoy. It's fabulous to see the Marxes early work, all done from 1929-1933. They were the hardest working comedy team in the business!

 Many of the skits seen in these films were Marx Bros. Broadway plays (Animal Crackers & The Cocoanuts)and other skits for other films were tested out in front of live audiences in theaters before they were filmed as movies to see what got laughs and what didn't. The Marx Bros. were comedy geniuses!

They had the best writers in the business working for them too, and that really makes the difference. That's one reason why these films are Comedy Classics!!

The Warner Bros. DVD's of their later films DO have lots of nice extras like comedy shorts and cartoons, and interviews with people that worked with Groucho, Chico & Harpo, which I find interesting-- The Bonus material in THIS 5 film set is very limited, but also cool.

The Marx Brothers are an all-time classic comedy team, and if you can find a copy of Groucho's 1959 Autobiography 'Groucho and Me', you should definitely check it out to learn all about the Marx Bros. lives and careers. Check here on Amazon or at your local Public Library....

2105153,1,B0002MHDYW,"This DVD boxset is nothing short of a disgrace and a major insult to Marx Brothers and DVD fans.

Not withstanding the fact that no real effort was put into restoring these brilliant films the lack of any extras worthy of the name is poor.

But worse still is the absolute SCANDAL of having a ""Bonus"" disc with only 15 minutes of interviews and nothing else!!!

These could easily have been added on to the 5 other discs which only have 3 trailers between them as extras.

The 40 page booklet doesn't compensate.

I do not recommend this boxset as I feel that it may have been a rushed job to cash in on the admirable Warners boxset - which has weaker films in general but though there isn't loads of Marx brothers related extras to cover 7 films they made up for it big time by adding tons of shorts which fills up the discs nicely.

However, I do recommend complaing to Universal at unmgfeedback@unistudios.com and with enough critical feedback maybe they will consider releasing it with better restored prints and proper extras (commentaries please) in the future.

Certainly if we do not complain in great numbers they will carry on ripping off the fans who they expect to buy the films regardless.

I bought mine on pre-order, believing the 6th bonus disc was a genuine bonus, and will return it for a full refund.",1100304000,33,1319,4.559322033898305
2105154,1,B0002MHDYW,"How disappointing. The rating is not based on the films- four of the five films are incredibly fun and full of lunacy-  it is Universal's half-hearted effort that is really a let-down. For that studio to re-release them in no better condition than they were in the late-90s releases is insulting.  No effort was made to find better film elements, the extras are pathetic (they would've been fine as part of a larger collection of extras) and ""Duck Soup"", one of the top 100 American Films of all time, doesn't even merit a commentary track!

Compare this shoddy work with MGM's labor of love from earlier this year on ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"", and Universal's effort looks darned poor.

Universal needs to hear from Marx Brothers fans, too. The Brothers deserve better and so do we.",1100217600,38,805,4.608391608391608
2105155,5,B0002MHDYW,"The Marx Brothers hit their peak with ""Duck Soup"". Sure, ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"" were both bigger box office hits and, while both those latter films have their moments they just can't quite compete with the inspired anarchy of ""Duck Soup"". Let's start with the positives first. It doesn't look like most of the films have any footage missing as near as I can tell. Sure, some of the editing still looks ragged but most of their early films (and films from that era for that matter) have that ""look"". The first three movies are a bit static looking (since the first two were based on their stage plays that's not a surprise--they look like photographed stage plays). With ""Monkey Business"" and ""Horse Feathers"" The Marx Brothers began to develop a style that was a bit more cinematic. All five films are essential for fans.

Now the bad news. Universal has been slapping together boxed sets lately of older films and TV series with little to no extras and without any effort at restoration. They're where Warner Brothers was about 6 years ago. The prints often don't look as sharp as they could and there's plenty of analog blemishes to muddy up the picture as well. Digitally many of these flaws could easily be corrected on these prints. Since the original negatives are long gone (they were shot on nitrate stock. Nitrate stock is quite unstable begins to disintegrate and shrink after a couple of decades). Unfortunately, we're left with prints that are several generations removed from the original negatives which means that these will probably never look perfect. Could they look better? Absolutely as there's been minimal effort to clean them up and none of them look as if there has been an effort to restore them. ""Horse Feathers"" still appears to be missing some material (unfortunately most of it is probably permanently lost)that probably could have been restored from foreign prints. These are an improvement on the old Image discs with better contrast.

The extras are a bit skimpy at best. We get some older ""The Today Show"" interviews. There's no documentary on The Marx Brothers career, the challenges they faced in reaching an audience and why, ultimately, MGM put them under contract only to dilute their best qualities. I'm also disappointed that there's no audio commentary. Surely former UCLA Professor Howard Suber would have been available to do a commentary on these terrific films? What about vintage newsreels discussing the previews of their movies?

While I appreciate the book, the introductory essay is skimpy. The quotes of Groucho from various films and images from the films/posters was a bright idea it's just that Universal didn't go far enough. A nice short documentary incorporating the interviews included here would have been nice. I appreciate the idea of the book but I also wish that it could be removed from as it is a bit cumbersome in the middle of the accordian style set. Still, the design of the set is quite nice.

I give the films 5 stars for the quality of these classics but 2 stars for the inferior presentation from Universal. It's a pity as Warner has most of the lesser Marx movies but did a marvelous job of restoring them and adding extras including commentaries to them. Considering that Universal has a very good restoration department and that they've done a marvelous job of restoring Hitchcock's classic films ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"", I'm really disappointed that more effort wasn't made here. Since, in the studio's view, the audience for these type of films continues to shrink, Universal didn't see the value of doing a massive restoration like what Criterion might do with these titles. It's an example of Hollywood not valuing its past.",1100131200,559,3733,4.874015748031496
2105156,2,B0002MHDYW,"If you already own the previous DVD or Laserdisc releases of these great classic movies, you may want to think twice about investing more money for only 15 minutes total of ""Today Show"" interviews with Harpo, Groucho, and Harpo's son promoting their books.  There is some fun here, but you want to kick the Today Show Director when they interrupt Groucho's story, after only 5 minutes, because they have other things to get to.  Groucho really looks stunned and put out that he was stopped.

There are also 3 trailers (Cocoanuts & Monkey Business have none) strangely tagged at the end to promote the MCA 1980's Home Video Tape release.

I guess Universal forgot that they own the rights to the Marx Brothers half-hour 1950's TV special ""THE INCREDIBLE JEWEL ROBBERY"".  This would have been a great addition to the box set! I have never seen this except for the old Castle Films home movie clip.

Restoration?  Well, Universal never used that word in their description, and they certainly didn't do it.

The choppy splices are still there in several movies.

The missing footage is still NOT there.

Some reels are still out of focus.

Some reels are still many generations away from the original negative and look very contrasty.

Some reels still have a bouncy picture (warped negative).

About 75% of the time the films do look good.

Night at the Opera has its points, but to see Harpo getting slapped around and his participation reduced to nodding and grinning between hackneyed love scenes really turns me off to the MGM formula that reigned in on the humor, and especially the originality of these first five flicks.

A note about Horse Feathers.  The scenes edited for American TV were still intact during presentations in England a couple of decades ago, and one would wish that a little legwork could be done towards a full restoration.  It seems a shame that the only chance to see the wonderful Harpo-Thelma Todd entanglement routine is as a recreation in one of Woody Allen's films.

Duck Soup has to be considered on the list of greatest comedies of all time.  Leo McCarey and the boys may have later disowned it, but their genius is on exhibit throughout.  Horse Feathers and Monkey Business are in the same class, and there is nothing else that has ever been made that comes close to touching the amazing sparks the three produce.

Despite being and old and creaky musical comedy, Animal Crackers overcomes its stagebound parentage and is quite a hoot until running out of steam at the end.  Cocoanuts is another thing altogether, smothered by the early sound technology and general sloppiness of the production, but in its own peculiar way is rather fascinating, like an archeological dig from some exotic site.

2105167,5,B0002MHDYW,"After years of waiting, I am very happy to see Universal Studios finally re-release on DVD's some of the best films that the Marx Brothers ever starred in.  Three of my personal favorite Marx Brothers films are included in this DVD set (""Monkey Business"", ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Duck Soup""), as well as the two other films that I also enjoy (""The Cocoanuts"" and ""Animal Crackers""). The common element that all five of these films have is that all four of the Marx Brothers acted in them: Grouch Marx (1890-1977), Harpo Marx (1888-1964), Chico Marx (1887-1961) and Zeppo Marx (1901-1979).  (The two other films that featured all four Marx Brothers that were not included in this DVD set were the 1926 ""Humor Risk"" and the 1931 ""The House that Shadows Built"".)

A brief description of each film included in this DVD set follows:

1. ""The Cocoanuts"" (1929).  The manager of a Florida hotel, Mr. Hammer (Groucho), will do anything to make money, including courting the wealthy widow Mrs. Potter (the delightful Margaret Dumont, 1882-1965) and selling real estate.  While the zany Chico and Harpo (they used their real first names in the film) are busily sabotaging Mr. Hammer's efforts, Bob Adams (Zeppo) is trying to court Mrs. Potter's daughter Polly (Mary Eaton, 1901-1948).

2. ""Animal Crackers"" (1930).  After Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding (Groucho) returns from an exploration of Africa, he attends a party hosted by the wealthy widow Mrs. Rittenhouse (Margaret Dumont again) with his assistant Horatio Jamison (Zeppo). A priceless painting is stolen during the party, and total mayhem ensues thanks in large part to The Professor (Harpo) and Signor Emanuel Ravelli (Chico).

3. ""Monkey Business"" (1931).  The four Marx Brothers (using their real names in the film) stowaway on board a ship headed to America.  While trying to evade the ship's crew, they are unwittingly & involuntarily forced into assisting two rival gangsters: Alky Briggs (Harry Woods, 1889-1968) and J.J. 'Big Joe' Helton (Rockliffe Fellowes, 1883-1950).  Thelma Todd (1905-1935) plays Lucille Briggs, Alky's wife.  Harpo's puppetshow scene is still one of my personal favorite scenes of all time with Harpo.

4. ""Horse Feathers"" (1932).  Huxley College has a new president, and it is none other than Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff (Groucho), whose son Frank (Zeppo) is a student at Huxley. To improve the Huxley's losing football team, Frank convinces his dad that they must recruit two new football players.  However, Frank mistakenly helps to recruit Bravelli (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) as the real football players are recruited by rival college Darwin; but the fun has only just begun!  Thelma Todd plays college-widow Connie Bailey.

5. ""Duck Soup"" (1933).  Probably the best Marx Brothers film of all time, the fictional country of Freedonia is financially bankrupt, but wealthy widow Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) donates $20-million to the bankrupt government with the promise that Freedonia's current president be replaced by dictator Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho).  Firefly insults Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern, 1895-1956) of neighboring Sylvania, who sends his two top spies, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), to Freedonia for reconnaissance as the nations go to war.

No one could reproduce the zany antics and humor that the Marx Brothers gave to 1930's audiences and those same antics continue to entertain new generations 70 years later.  Consequently, I give a resounding 5 out of 5 stars to Universal's release of ""The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection"" DVD set and highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great laugh!",1098921600,6,3623,5.24263431542461

The movies themselves are just wonderful; the Paramount era of the Marxes is easily the most zany/insane of their career, total mayhem.

Universal has stated in emails I received that efforts were made to find all they could in restoration. Perhaps; it was once believed a clean print of ""Horse Feathers"" was on 16mm in the UK, and that Harpo himself owned an uncut print of it that was later stolen. That said, the offering is sharper in contrast and clarity than earlier DVDs, but suffers the same picture jitter in many spots, and is missing some of the dialogue in Connie Bailey's apartment (some of it due to missing frames, the other perhaps to code...what Connie actually says to Baravelli is ""...you overcome me..."" to which he says, ""OK, but remember it was your idea..."" as he jumps on top of her. Did ""the code"" force that out? A shame no intact prints exist). It is also believed the final sequence of the brothers playing cards while the college burns was indeed filmed, but footage is long gone. There is a still of that sequence that has been published elsewhere.

The Coconuts also has varying degrees of quality, as it was likely culled from different prints of generation degradation.

I will say Animal Crackers is superb. The film that was lost to audiences for many years turns out to look clean, crisp, and I counted 4 instances of restored dialogue that had been cut from every print I had seen since 1973. This was a joy to watch.

Monkey Business looks good, however there were some vertical artifacts at one point that I would have thought could have been corrected, although no too distracting from an otherwise wonderful film.

Duck Soup rounds it out, and while this film was originally poorly received by critics easily remains a masterpiece today.

As others have stated bonus materials are minimal, and there are many things that *could* have been included. I will critcize the commentary of ""Horse Feathers."" The announcer continues to call Chico ""chee-ko,"" when the correct and more accepted pronunciation (including how Groucho always referred to his brother) is ""chick-o."" The announcer also states that the radio announcer at the football game is a young Walter Brennan. Perhaps he got that from the IMDB site, but I seriously question the casting. A slight resemblance, but little else, and elsewhere I have read it is truly Phil (Phillips) Tead, who many may recall as Professor Pepperwinkle in the 1950s ""Adventures of Superman."" Look closely at him and you may agree that is probably more accurate than Brennan. That being the case, this narration is imbedded into a film and does little good in the long run.

While everyone is a critic, and can make assessments onto the quality and bonus content (or lack thereof), never lose fact that these are true classic films and deserve repeated viewings.",1098230400,31,2978,4.780155642023346

As an adult I get more of the jokes and realize that some of their material is pretty sexist but its comedy, so you can't take it seriously, I mean it's the MARX BROTHERS for Pete's sake.
