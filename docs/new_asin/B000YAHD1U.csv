3025590,5,B000YAHD1U,"I have always been a big fan of Mickey Spillane's hard-boiled, two-fisted private detective Mike Hammer, the original ""badass"" way before the term was coined, from the literary to the film and TV versions.  Since the character's introduction in 1947 in Spillane's first Mike Hammer novel ""I, The Jury,"" Hammer has been played by numerous famous and not-too-famous actors, including Biff Elliot (in the 1953 adaptation of ""I, The Jury""), Ralph Meeker (1955's ""Kiss Me Deadly""), Darren ""Kolchak, The Night Stalker"" McGavin (the 1958-1960 Mike Hammer TV Series), Mickey Spillane himself (1963's ""The Girl Hunters""), Kevin Dobson of ""Kojak"" and ""Knots Landing"" fame (in the 1981 TV Movie ""Margin For Murder"") and Rob Estes (in a 1994 re-imaging of the character in the TV movie ""Come Die With Me"").  Of course, for TV viewers of the 1980s-1990s, the actor most identified with Mike Hammer was Stacy Keach who played the role in three TV series and several TV movies.  Somewhere along this long list of Mike Hammer incarnations was a 29-year-later re-make of ""I, The Jury"" starring then up-and-coming tough-guy actor Armand Assante, who eventually ""made his bones"" playing sinister anti-heroes and Mafia mobsters (like the title role in the 1996 HBO ""Gotti"" movie, where he won a Best Actor Emmy Award).  Critics and audiences back then felt Assante (who had strong Italian features) was miscast as Hammer while lambasting the overall quality of the film as more of an ""exploitation""-type flick.  In retrospect, the 1982 version of ""I, The Jury"" is actually fun to watch for some laughs, cheap thrills and uncut gratuitous sex and violence.  One can forget production values and quality when Assante's charisma and femme fatale villain Barbara Carrera ignite the screen.",1467936000,,1765,5.153846153846154

Lots of action, tough guy dialogue, great looking women and a brutal ending.  This movie does a nice job of placing the anachronistic anti-hero, Hammer, into the early '80s setting of this film.  Armand Assante proved a pleasant surprise, casting-wise, as Mike Hammer and the rest of the cast was equally enjoyable.  If ""political correctness"" is your bag, avoid this movie.

3025601,5,B000YAHD1U,"Finally released to DVD after 23 years (this movie was made in 1982), which stars Armand Assante (""Gotti"") as Mickey Spillane's hard-boiled, fist-in-your-face-first-and-take-names-later gumshoe, who is as good with his wits as he is with his gun. A buddy from 'Nam is murdered senselessly and Hammer sets out on revenge to find out who did it and why. The road is paved with the wrong intentions from lots of suspects, even his buddy in the NYPD, Pat Chambers (Paul Sorvino, ""Goodfellas""), who may be playing both sides. A sex therapist (Barbara Carrera, ""Never Say Never Again"") isn't playing it straight with Hammer from minute one, until he delves deeper. A CIA operative named Romero tries to stop Hammer when he gets too close to anyone connected with the murder, and sends a terminal psychotic (Judson Scott) to run interference, who dresses up his female victims like redheads and then kills them! Along the way, a mobster (Alan King, ""Just Tell Me What You Want"") is also an accomplice. Hammer's sexy secretary, Velda (Laurene Landon) is herself a charmer, but  packs a piece instead of brass knuckles. Hard hitting action, more than any other movie in the genre, is this movie's goal, along with lovely ladies, and Assante pulls it off! Somebody is gonna wish that he didn't make Hammer's day, until Hammer finds out who the killer is: the last person he never suspected! Definitely GET this one and have a guys' night in.

3025604,5,B000YAHD1U,This barely known masterpiece of bare knuckle and bare breast cinema has long cried for a deserved DVD release. An excellent transfer of this fast moving flick starring a WAY under-rated Armand Assante as Mike Hammer (Please forget Stacey Keach ever played the character) is rough and every bit as gruff as the Spillane character ever was on the page.

3025611,2,B000YAHD1U,"Through print interviews, commentary tracks, and in person question and answer sessions, I feel like I may have heard more about I, the Jury than any other film in which Larry Cohen has had a creative hand. The problem is that most everything Cohen has to say about the film is incredibly negative. I am not sure how much his anger and frustration at the producers of the film and the actual finished product affected my view of it, but it is certainly a messy piece of cinema.

3025615,4,B000YAHD1U,"TV-like in scope, but cinematic enough in its flavor, Richard T. Heffron's film of the old Mickey Spillane crime potboiler is in many ways a very good movie to watch. And by this, I mean that there is plenty to see here: beautiful naked Playmate-like women, a bizarre sex clinic scenario, a few chillingly violent murder scenes, some rampaging car chases, Armand Assante toting a M-16 rifle while chasing down bad guys, and a steamy as winter windows love scene between the gorgeous Barbara Carrera and Assante. Visually, the picture offers much, but story wise, it seems to go for an ""I'm too sexy for my script"" approach and loses some of the menace that came with earlier black and white films involving the Hammer character. In fact, it seems in the end that ""I, the Jury"" depends upon the sexual appeal of its great cast more so than it does a commitment to Spillane's grim source material, despite the fact that the film has some slasher-movie moments and some harrowing chases that attempt to elevate it beyond the usual erotic thriller film. Nonetheless, the movie is a quality mystery in many ways, making a good double feature with something like ""The Big Sleep,"" or ""The Man with Bogart's Face,"" or even the old Mitchum sleeper ""Farewell, My Lovely."" Beginning life as a screenplay composed by Larry Cohen, the production's troubled history is documented elsewhere, but I enjoy this final remnant of the American Cinema company--despite the fact that films like ""The Octagon"" and ""Dogs"" aren't necessarily on the higher end of film preservation lists, American Cinema did give the world many memorable titles...despite its ultimate corruption of Cohen's written material, I doubt that it was ever possible to ""miscast"" Mike Hammer (considering the fact that Ralph Meeker, Darren McGavin, Stacy Keach, and even author Spillane have essayed the role of the character at one time or another, on both the big and small screens). However, Assante does play Hammer a bit more flippantly than Robert Bray in 1957's ""My Gun is Quick"", for example, lacking the savagery and misanthropic detail that others put into him; yes, the picture is rushed, unrealized, and scattershot, but even though it may be a real loose canon of a film, it is still entertaining enough to register (no matter how ""cheap"" and inconsequential it may ultimately be). Still, ""I, the Jury"" is a good example of Hollywood ambition at its sexiest; Assante is attractive, the women are unbelievably hot, and the pacing is pretty intense. While the violence is not quite as graphic as I recalled in my memory, some of it is still pretty vicious (and I don't remember if the Fox Movie Channel version was a widescreen print or not), and this is an old-style detective picture that is better than any of the dehumanizing films that we are being fed today (sadly, there do not seem to be any good lone individual private eye movies being made of this caliber anymore). If you are offended by the nature of the film's graphic sexuality and its rather flippant violence, ""I, the Jury"" may not be to your taste, but if you want a brave and adventurous movie that shows signs of having way too many creative hands stirring in the pot, then pick this one up (whether you can get it on video or on DVD--a Blu-Ray, I'm afraid, only exists in my dreams).
Apparently, ""I, the Jury"" is now available for purchase as a DVD-on-demand item through the Fox Cinema Archives line (the ""release"" date of this item is listed as March 17th, 2015 on Amazon's page), finally restored in a 1.77:1 frame and in a letterboxed format. Sadly, I didn't realize this when I paid out a bit extra for a very good--but out of date--original VHS tape copy instead--but I'm not too bummed, since I am a collector. Still, while the VHS is not in widescreen, it appears to be a 1.33:1 TV print--pretty good overall, since it doesn't cut anyone's head off or push any characters out of the frame during a scene, but I may end up springing for an archive DVD print of this one. Why other American Cinema titles have been released widely on DVD with fine extras and restored picture quality and sound (such as ""The Octagon"", etc.) but ""I, the Jury"" continues to be ignored my major quality DVD distributors is a mystery in itself that I can only attribute a problem with mainstream distributors securing the rights to this one for home video. Not the best movie ever made, sure, but if you like the tough and gritty Mike Hammer mysteries, this is one curio worth checking out and keeping. B+",1427241600,,4522,4.725316455696203

There are several excellent chase scenes and although very gory by the standards of the day, modern day zombie-killer shows and movies are far, far worse.

The plot is a little(!) convoluted, but at least Mike Hammer keeps focused on his personal goal: Who killed my buddy? Barbara Carrera is beautiful and does a good job, as does Paul Sorvino, but everyone else is just routine.

3025631,2,B000YAHD1U,"Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer was created in his 1947 novel ""I, the Jury"" at the very peak of film noir and he went on to be featured in numerous films including ""I, the Jury"" (1953), ""My Gun is Quick"" (1957), and ""The Girl Hunters"" (1963). He was played by Biff Elliot (1953), Ralph Meeker (1955), Robert Bray (1957), and even Mickey Spillane (1963). The character is most associated with Stacey Keach who played him in film (1983, 2003) and on TV (1984-7), although personally I prefer Darren McGavin's interpretation (1957-8).

Unlike his fellow literary gum shoes Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, Hammer tends to be more pragmatic and brutal, and the film is true to the novel in that respect, as it is with Hammer's secretary being more than a pretty face. But the story has been updated for the 40s to the 80s, and given a slick James Bond type opening, and I'm not sure this works as well.

Tough guy Armand Assante (1949) plays Mike Hammer. New York born Assante is best known for his gangster roles in films like ""Hoffa"" (1992), ""Chicago Overcoat"" (2007), and ""American Gangster"" (2007). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 4 times and won an Emmy for ""Gotti"" (1966). Unfortunately he mumbles so much in this film it's really hard to understand him.

Sexy Barbara Carrera (1945) plays the femme fatale. She is best known for her role as Fatima Blush in ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983) for which she received her second Golden Globe nomination. The film has Carrera in full frontal nudity, as well as lots of soft porn elements which may offend some people.

Lovely Laurene Landon (1957) plays Velda, Hammer's loyal secretary. She's probably best known for her role as a female wrestler in ""All the Marbles"" (1981) and the stewardess in ""Airplane II"" (1982).

Paul Sorvino (1939) plays Hammer's detective friend. Sorvino is best known for his recurring role on ""Law and Order"" (1991-2) and as the mob boss from ""Goodfellas"" (1990). He always gives good performances - I like him best as Henry Kissinger in ""Nixon"" (1995).

Comedian Alan King (1927-2004) has a small part even though he is billed third.

The film is directed by Richard Heffron (1930-2007) who is best known for ""Futureworld"" (1976) although he worked primarily in TV (""The Bold Ones"", ""Banacek"", ""The Rockford Files""). This was his last film.

The NY Times liked the ""spectacular chases and ingenious gore"" and said Assante's ""charming half-sneer and easy registering of delight and pain are almost irresistible.""

The top grossing films in 1982 were ""E.T"", ""Tootsie"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""First Blood"", and ""Rocky 3"". Oscar winners were ""Ghandi"" (Picture, Actor, Director), ""Sophie's Choice"" (Actress), ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" (Supporting Actor), and ""Tootsie"" (Supporting Actress). Other notable releases were ""My Favorite Year"", ""Personal Best"", ""Fast Times at Ridgmont High"", ""Victor/Victoria"", and ""The Verdict"".

The plot is kind of crazy, with sex therapists, CIA agents, sex fiend killers, mob bosses, corrupt police, and who knows what else. Since the sound is so poor, you can barely understand what's going on anyway, which is probably a plus.

Bottom line - not the worst Hammer film, but certainly far from the best.",1330905600,,3215,4.968342644320298

3025637,5,B000YAHD1U,"No doubt he was compared to Pacino at the time, but Assante IS  Mike Hammer. His tough as nails attitude that he brings to the role is mesmerizing. The opening title sequence, with music by Bill Conti was very well done. I also think that the filmakers were hoping this would be the first of many sequels or chapters ( much like James Bond 007 ). Sadly, this was the only one starring Assante. I would have loved to have seen a series of Mike Hammer adventures on the big screen, but we were instead jilted into the awful TV Series starring Stacey Keach. I, the Jury, remains a first class thriller. The plot is complicated, but Assante steals the show as the womanizing PI. If this movie were made today, it would be unrecognizable. The gratuitious nudity would easily offend today's feminists so that would be cut. Then there's the graphic violence which would be too much for today's overly sensitive audiences. I,the Jury, is filled with politically incorrect scenes and roles, but that's what makes it great to watch today. The supporting cast is also wonderful to watch: Paul Sorvino as the police Captain, Alan King as the Mafioso boss, and Barbara Carerra as the Sex Clinic doctor. The action is swift, the music is first class, and the women are goregous. Assante delivers on all levels and the direction is as sharp as the dialog. If you can handle the pace of this mystery-thriller and the no-holds- barred Mickey Spillane, then buy this one today. ( Not on DVD yet-Only VHS )",1179532800,,1487,4.611320754716981
3025638,3,B000YAHD1U,"This is a 1980's updating of the classic 50's pulp novel by the great Mickey Spillane  and it has its fair share of  violence and sex -and is not recommended for those who find such elements unacceptable .

The script is by Larry Cohen -who was originally slated to direct but was removed from the project after shooting began .His script has little to do with the original book and if you want a movie that follows the Spillane plot then you need to go back to the original .

Mike Hammer goes hunting for the guys who killed his old army buddy and in so doing finds himself up to his ears in a complex plot involving the Syndicate , the CIA and mind control techniques being used to create robot assassins .There is also a sex clinic stirred into the plot along the way .

The story is frankly untidy and sprawling  and the movie would have best been served by adhering to the pure lines of the original novel rather than pursuing then modish ideas and plot devices .The movie is thus incoherent at times and it seems as if some quite large chunks of plot exposition were jettisoned in order to make room for more action sequences

Ignore the confused and disjointed plot however and there are some good things about I, The Jury -the action scenes are well handled ,there is the odd sharp and cynical line and the acting especially from Armand Assante as Hammer is good .

Its not a bad movie but given the talent involved it could and should have been a lot better .Watchable -if you are stuck for something better to do",1104796800,,1523,4.3568904593639575

3025640,3,B000YAHD1U,"This is pretty much a 1982 by-the-numbers rehash of both the Mickey Spillane 1947 novel and the 1953 film of the same name.  Here, though, Mike Hammer's secretary Velda not only carries a gun but can use it as well as her boss.  And here as well, unlike the 1953 Hollywood Code restrictions that kept film directors from showing all the naughty bits, director Richard Heffron can display Armand Assante's Hammer and Barbara Carrera's sexy Caroline Bennett going at it with wild abandon.
This movie moves through its Spillane-juiced plot fairly effortlessly.  Assante is fine, Paul Sorvino is appropriately tight-lipped as Pat Chambers, Mike Hammer's police force contact, and the women all flagrantly disobey women's lib edicts of equal status and respect by submitting (either immediately or eventually) to Hammer's virile presence.
Spillane was known, when he started out, as the number one purveyor of pure pulp in detective fiction--i.e., overt sex and violence.  Heffron's film gives a few sly winks at this; the director realizes that juxtaposing some of the writer's themes with '80s mentality fits and doesn't fit, both at the same time.  This paradox mostly works because nobody watching the film has to think much about anything at all--it IS pure pulp.  Hammer is subjected to the pain of seeing the corpse of his best friend and to some gritty torture, later in the film, and this all adds to the juicy pulpy ride.
Not great, but not bad.  An evening's diversion for those of you who don't mind a slightly sarcastic ""return"" to the mores of the '50s couched in '80s 'hipness'.",1038528000,,1588,4.947368421052632

3260087,5,B000YAHD1U,"I have always been a big fan of Mickey Spillane's hard-boiled, two-fisted private detective Mike Hammer, the original ""badass"" way before the term was coined, from the literary to the film and TV versions.  Since the character's introduction in 1947 in Spillane's first Mike Hammer novel ""I, The Jury,"" Hammer has been played by numerous famous and not-too-famous actors, including Biff Elliot (in the 1953 adaptation of ""I, The Jury""), Ralph Meeker (1955's ""Kiss Me Deadly""), Darren ""Kolchak, The Night Stalker"" McGavin (the 1958-1960 Mike Hammer TV Series), Mickey Spillane himself (1963's ""The Girl Hunters""), Kevin Dobson of ""Kojak"" and ""Knots Landing"" fame (in the 1981 TV Movie ""Margin For Murder"") and Rob Estes (in a 1994 re-imaging of the character in the TV movie ""Come Die With Me"").  Of course, for TV viewers of the 1980s-1990s, the actor most identified with Mike Hammer was Stacy Keach who played the role in three TV series and several TV movies.  Somewhere along this long list of Mike Hammer incarnations was a 29-year-later re-make of ""I, The Jury"" starring then up-and-coming tough-guy actor Armand Assante, who eventually ""made his bones"" playing sinister anti-heroes and Mafia mobsters (like the title role in the 1996 HBO ""Gotti"" movie, where he won a Best Actor Emmy Award).  Critics and audiences back then felt Assante (who had strong Italian features) was miscast as Hammer while lambasting the overall quality of the film as more of an ""exploitation""-type flick.  In retrospect, the 1982 version of ""I, The Jury"" is actually fun to watch for some laughs, cheap thrills and uncut gratuitous sex and violence.  One can forget production values and quality when Assante's charisma and femme fatale villain Barbara Carrera ignite the screen.",1467936000,,1765,5.153846153846154

A buddy from 'Nam is murdered senselessly and Hammer sets out on revenge to find out who did it and why. The road is paved with the wrong intentions from lots of suspects, even his buddy in the NYPD, Pat Chambers (Paul Sorvino, ""Goodfellas""), who may be playing both sides. A sex therapist (Barbara Carrera, ""Never Say Never Again"") isn't playing it straight with Hammer from minute one, until he delves deeper. A CIA operative named Romero tries to stop Hammer when he gets too close to anyone connected with the murder, and sends a terminal psychotic (Judson Scott) to run interference, who dresses up his female victims like redheads and then kills them!

3260112,4,B000YAHD1U,"TV-like in scope, but cinematic enough in its flavor, Richard T. Heffron's film of the old Mickey Spillane crime potboiler is in many ways a very good movie to watch. And by this, I mean that there is plenty to see here: beautiful naked Playmate-like women, a bizarre sex clinic scenario, a few chillingly violent murder scenes, some rampaging car chases, Armand Assante toting a M-16 rifle while chasing down bad guys, and a steamy as winter windows love scene between the gorgeous Barbara Carrera and Assante. Visually, the picture offers much, but story wise, it seems to go for an ""I'm too sexy for my script"" approach and loses some of the menace that came with earlier black and white films involving the Hammer character. In fact, it seems in the end that ""I, the Jury"" depends upon the sexual appeal of its great cast more so than it does a commitment to Spillane's grim source material, despite the fact that the film has some slasher-movie moments and some harrowing chases that attempt to elevate it beyond the usual erotic thriller film. Nonetheless, the movie is a quality mystery in many ways, making a good double feature with something like ""The Big Sleep,"" or ""The Man with Bogart's Face,"" or even the old Mitchum sleeper ""Farewell, My Lovely."" Beginning life as a screenplay composed by Larry Cohen, the production's troubled history is documented elsewhere, but I enjoy this final remnant of the American Cinema company--despite the fact that films like ""The Octagon"" and ""Dogs"" aren't necessarily on the higher end of film preservation lists, American Cinema did give the world many memorable titles...despite its ultimate corruption of Cohen's written material, I doubt that it was ever possible to ""miscast"" Mike Hammer (considering the fact that Ralph Meeker, Darren McGavin, Stacy Keach, and even author Spillane have essayed the role of the character at one time or another, on both the big and small screens). However, Assante does play Hammer a bit more flippantly than Robert Bray in 1957's ""My Gun is Quick"", for example, lacking the savagery and misanthropic detail that others put into him; yes, the picture is rushed, unrealized, and scattershot, but even though it may be a real loose canon of a film, it is still entertaining enough to register (no matter how ""cheap"" and inconsequential it may ultimately be). Still, ""I, the Jury"" is a good example of Hollywood ambition at its sexiest; Assante is attractive, the women are unbelievably hot, and the pacing is pretty intense. While the violence is not quite as graphic as I recalled in my memory, some of it is still pretty vicious (and I don't remember if the Fox Movie Channel version was a widescreen print or not), and this is an old-style detective picture that is better than any of the dehumanizing films that we are being fed today (sadly, there do not seem to be any good lone individual private eye movies being made of this caliber anymore). If you are offended by the nature of the film's graphic sexuality and its rather flippant violence, ""I, the Jury"" may not be to your taste, but if you want a brave and adventurous movie that shows signs of having way too many creative hands stirring in the pot, then pick this one up (whether you can get it on video or on DVD--a Blu-Ray, I'm afraid, only exists in my dreams).
Apparently, ""I, the Jury"" is now available for purchase as a DVD-on-demand item through the Fox Cinema Archives line (the ""release"" date of this item is listed as March 17th, 2015 on Amazon's page), finally restored in a 1.77:1 frame and in a letterboxed format. Sadly, I didn't realize this when I paid out a bit extra for a very good--but out of date--original VHS tape copy instead--but I'm not too bummed, since I am a collector. Still, while the VHS is not in widescreen, it appears to be a 1.33:1 TV print--pretty good overall, since it doesn't cut anyone's head off or push any characters out of the frame during a scene, but I may end up springing for an archive DVD print of this one. Why other American Cinema titles have been released widely on DVD with fine extras and restored picture quality and sound (such as ""The Octagon"", etc.) but ""I, the Jury"" continues to be ignored my major quality DVD distributors is a mystery in itself that I can only attribute a problem with mainstream distributors securing the rights to this one for home video. Not the best movie ever made, sure, but if you like the tough and gritty Mike Hammer mysteries, this is one curio worth checking out and keeping. B+",1427241600,,4522,4.725316455696203

He was played by Biff Elliot (1953), Ralph Meeker (1955), Robert Bray (1957), and even Mickey Spillane (1963). The character is most associated with Stacey Keach who played him in film (1983, 2003) and on TV (1984-7), although personally I prefer Darren McGavin's interpretation (1957-8).

Unlike his fellow literary gum shoes Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, Hammer tends to be more pragmatic and brutal, and the film is true to the novel in that respect, as it is with Hammer's secretary being more than a pretty face. But the story has been updated for the 40s to the 80s, and given a slick James Bond type opening, and I'm not sure this works as well.

Tough guy Armand Assante (1949) plays Mike Hammer. New York born Assante is best known for his gangster roles in films like ""Hoffa"" (1992), ""Chicago Overcoat"" (2007), and ""American Gangster"" (2007). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 4 times and won an Emmy for ""Gotti"" (1966). Unfortunately he mumbles so much in this film it's really hard to understand him.

Sexy Barbara Carrera (1945) plays the femme fatale. She is best known for her role as Fatima Blush in ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983) for which she received her second Golden Globe nomination. The film has Carrera in full frontal nudity, as well as lots of soft porn elements which may offend some people.

Lovely Laurene Landon (1957) plays Velda, Hammer's loyal secretary. She's probably best known for her role as a female wrestler in ""All the Marbles"" (1981) and the stewardess in ""Airplane II"" (1982).

Paul Sorvino (1939) plays Hammer's detective friend. Sorvino is best known for his recurring role on ""Law and Order"" (1991-2) and as the mob boss from ""Goodfellas"" (1990). He always gives good performances - I like him best as Henry Kissinger in ""Nixon"" (1995).

Comedian Alan King (1927-2004) has a small part even though he is billed third.

The film is directed by Richard Heffron (1930-2007) who is best known for ""Futureworld"" (1976) although he worked primarily in TV (""The Bold Ones"", ""Banacek"", ""The Rockford Files""). This was his last film.

The NY Times liked the ""spectacular chases and ingenious gore"" and said Assante's ""charming half-sneer and easy registering of delight and pain are almost irresistible.""

The top grossing films in 1982 were ""E.T"", ""Tootsie"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""First Blood"", and ""Rocky 3"". Oscar winners were ""Ghandi"" (Picture, Actor, Director), ""Sophie's Choice"" (Actress), ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" (Supporting Actor), and ""Tootsie"" (Supporting Actress). Other notable releases were ""My Favorite Year"", ""Personal Best"", ""Fast Times at Ridgmont High"", ""Victor/Victoria"", and ""The Verdict"".

The plot is kind of crazy, with sex therapists, CIA agents, sex fiend killers, mob bosses, corrupt police, and who knows what else. Since the sound is so poor, you can barely understand what's going on anyway, which is probably a plus.

Bottom line - not the worst Hammer film, but certainly far from the best.",1330905600,,3215,4.968342644320298

The film captures the Mike Hammer character well though I do feel Stacy Keach was the best and Assante's portrayal gave him an interesting Italian feel. Great visuals from wardobe, to feel of the city, to the eye candy.

Lauren Landon ... what is there to say.  But the story is awful.

3260134,5,B000YAHD1U,"No doubt he was compared to Pacino at the time, but Assante IS  Mike Hammer. His tough as nails attitude that he brings to the role is mesmerizing. The opening title sequence, with music by Bill Conti was very well done. I also think that the filmakers were hoping this would be the first of many sequels or chapters ( much like James Bond 007 ). Sadly, this was the only one starring Assante. I would have loved to have seen a series of Mike Hammer adventures on the big screen, but we were instead jilted into the awful TV Series starring Stacey Keach. I, the Jury, remains a first class thriller. The plot is complicated, but Assante steals the show as the womanizing PI. If this movie were made today, it would be unrecognizable. The gratuitious nudity would easily offend today's feminists so that would be cut. Then there's the graphic violence which would be too much for today's overly sensitive audiences. I,the Jury, is filled with politically incorrect scenes and roles, but that's what makes it great to watch today. The supporting cast is also wonderful to watch: Paul Sorvino as the police Captain, Alan King as the Mafioso boss, and Barbara Carerra as the Sex Clinic doctor. The action is swift, the music is first class, and the women are goregous. Assante delivers on all levels and the direction is as sharp as the dialog. If you can handle the pace of this mystery-thriller and the no-holds- barred Mickey Spillane, then buy this one today. ( Not on DVD yet-Only VHS )",1179532800,,1487,4.611320754716981
3260135,3,B000YAHD1U,"This is a 1980's updating of the classic 50's pulp novel by the great Mickey Spillane  and it has its fair share of  violence and sex -and is not recommended for those who find such elements unacceptable .

The script is by Larry Cohen -who was originally slated to direct but was removed from the project after shooting began .His script has little to do with the original book and if you want a movie that follows the Spillane plot then you need to go back to the original .

Mike Hammer goes hunting for the guys who killed his old army buddy and in so doing finds himself up to his ears in a complex plot involving the Syndicate , the CIA and mind control techniques being used to create robot assassins .There is also a sex clinic stirred into the plot along the way .

The story is frankly untidy and sprawling  and the movie would have best been served by adhering to the pure lines of the original novel rather than pursuing then modish ideas and plot devices .The movie is thus incoherent at times and it seems as if some quite large chunks of plot exposition were jettisoned in order to make room for more action sequences

Ignore the confused and disjointed plot however and there are some good things about I, The Jury -the action scenes are well handled ,there is the odd sharp and cynical line and the acting especially from Armand Assante as Hammer is good .

Its not a bad movie but given the talent involved it could and should have been a lot better .Watchable -if you are stuck for something better to do",1104796800,,1523,4.3568904593639575

Based upon the novel by Mickey Spillane.

  Armand Assante is ""Mike Hammer"", a private detective in new York City.  There is a killer on the loose.  He has already killed a one-arm cop in his home.  Then each furthur victim has some connection to the first victim.  Mike Hammer is close on the trail and meets some sexy women along the way.  This case is so dangerous he can't even trust his friends on the force.

  Armand Assante really made this film for me.

3260137,3,B000YAHD1U,"This is pretty much a 1982 by-the-numbers rehash of both the Mickey Spillane 1947 novel and the 1953 film of the same name.  Here, though, Mike Hammer's secretary Velda not only carries a gun but can use it as well as her boss.  And here as well, unlike the 1953 Hollywood Code restrictions that kept film directors from showing all the naughty bits, director Richard Heffron can display Armand Assante's Hammer and Barbara Carrera's sexy Caroline Bennett going at it with wild abandon.
This movie moves through its Spillane-juiced plot fairly effortlessly.  Assante is fine, Paul Sorvino is appropriately tight-lipped as Pat Chambers, Mike Hammer's police force contact, and the women all flagrantly disobey women's lib edicts of equal status and respect by submitting (either immediately or eventually) to Hammer's virile presence.
Spillane was known, when he started out, as the number one purveyor of pure pulp in detective fiction--i.e., overt sex and violence.  Heffron's film gives a few sly winks at this; the director realizes that juxtaposing some of the writer's themes with '80s mentality fits and doesn't fit, both at the same time.  This paradox mostly works because nobody watching the film has to think much about anything at all--it IS pure pulp.  Hammer is subjected to the pain of seeing the corpse of his best friend and to some gritty torture, later in the film, and this all adds to the juicy pulpy ride.
Not great, but not bad.  An evening's diversion for those of you who don't mind a slightly sarcastic ""return"" to the mores of the '50s couched in '80s 'hipness'.",1038528000,,1588,4.947368421052632
