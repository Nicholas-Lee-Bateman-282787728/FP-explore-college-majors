8356774,5,B0028RY3K6,"This item has never been released, but I am hopeful that it will be released. This series was a classic battle between the Braves and the Cleveland Indians. The Braves had Maddux, Glavine, Smoltz and Avery -- an amazing starting rotation. They were managed by Bobby Cox who had a long run of division titles. I would love to re-live these games and hope they will be released soon (long overdue).",1512000000,,396,4.591549295774648
