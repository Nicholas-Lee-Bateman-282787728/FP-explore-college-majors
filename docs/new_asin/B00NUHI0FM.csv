Chuck has  an engaging screen presence and clearly knows his subject well. It's refreshing to find veterans portrayed as citizens who did their duty then reentered society as productive members.",1420416000,,313,5.137254901960785
8680300,5,B00NUHI0FM,"This documentary is outstanding and heartwarming in every way !!  Chuck N. Baker's Vietnam photo on the cover of the DVD box until the ending photo in the film from Vietnam, with his beautiful music throughout, just made the film extremely enjoyable.

The program content was fantastic !!  It was a delight to see people I know in Las Vegas:  ""Doc"" Moss from American Legion Post 149, Paul Sobel and Ed Kranson from the Jewish War Veterans Department of Nevada and Post 65; and he even included members of the Society of Military Widows of Southern Nevada Chapter 34 at the Defending Freedom Memorial at Red Rock Conservation Area.

All of the interviews with veterans who have made positive contributions to our country - both in their military service and in their post-service work - made my heart beat with pride.

I am most proud of Chuck N. Baker for making this wonderful documentary.  He did a great job putting it together into a fantastic film !!

Kudos to Chuck for this great film !!",1412812800,4,995,4.645714285714286
