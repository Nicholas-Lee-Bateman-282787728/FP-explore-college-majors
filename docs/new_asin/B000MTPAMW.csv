8172318,1,B000MTPAMW,"Disappointing 
When you spend school funds to help your students with fundamentals you expect the materials you buy online on DVD to be relevant and helpful to your students.  This video put out by Alfred Music Publishing is a direct copy of the 1989 video; it has not been updated from the VHS version your retired band director likely purchased.  Although the information on drop spins may have not changed, it is difficult for your students to relate to purely based on the hokey-ness of late 80s fashion and narration, not to mention the weird zoom in and zoom out from the camera man on the girls leg warmers that were fashionable at the time.  Thinking about it... most of the people in the video are probably retired now.  Again, the information may be good, but the presentation is less than acceptable for the price.  Go to Youtube instead, save the money.  I could have produced something better than this.",1484006400,,916,4.6875

8172322,4,B000MTPAMW,"I always wish to leran the basics about flag twirling, and this video explain in a such easy way...
It teach the basic movements, and postures... Its really useful if you don't know anything about the art of twirl Flags.
My only ""negative"" opinions are:
1: Its really short the video, so I think its to expensive for a really short video.
2: The recording is really old.",1363219200,4,370,4.455882352941177
