900070,4,6304578466,"If you know the Wayans bros (White Chicks, Scary Movie, Little Man, My Wife & Kids etc) you'll know how they can make you laugh! This movie is no exception. Although is wasn't directed by the Wayans Bros, Marlon does a great job acting in it.

Its the story of Marlon who plays Kenny- a basketball player in a team alongside with his brother Anton. In a freak accident, Anton dies and then returns as a ghost to help Kenny and his team win the championships.

The 6th man starts off slow... i wasn't into it for the first 20 minutes or so, but once Anton returns its really funny because the two brothers play fight and argue all the time but nobody can see Anton except for Kenny so Kenny just looks like a crazy person but its hilarious.

Like i said it does start off slow, but its a good movie to watch at least once.",1231459200,,821,4.1835443037974684

900126,5,6304578466,"This movie was great back in the day man. Just like so many other movies that I get off amazon or from wherever, I used to watch this and never get tired of it. This is a story of two brothers, Antoine Tyler(Kadeem Hardison) & Kenny Tyler(Marlon Wayans) whos lives are centered around being college basketball stars. Brothers who love and care for one another and that have been through everything togeather. Including their father dying & their rise to the NCAA with college team The Huskies. Things take a turn for the worse when Antoine(Hardison) takes it to the hole for a big jam and looses his breath after the dunk. He falls flat back on the ground and the game is delayed. His brother Kenny(Wayans) immediantly comes to his aid and finds out that Antoine is going to the hospital. He wanted to go with him but Antione said no, stay here and finish. 'I'll be back.' Kenney and the Huskies suffer a defeat and Kenney rushes to the locker room to pack up and go to the hospital only to find out his brother died on the way there by his coach and he is devastated. Though the Huskies continue on, they just keep losing and losing every game and can't seem to win without Antoine. In an empty stadium one night Kenny drops his bags and talks to his deceased brother. Saying he can't do it without him and that they need him. This truly teary-eyed tale continues on with his brother returning as the ghostly 'Sixth Man' as he and his brother reunite and the Huskies pick up their game intensly. There are many hilarious scenes of Antoine messing with Kenny such as him going on a date. Only Kenny can see him so it just makes it that much greater. I don't wanna spoil anything else so yea just use your imagination. Wayans is the perfect guy for this and when its all said and done and they say their goodbyes you can't help but shed a tear with the great acting. If your a fan of basketball or if you just want some good laughs and don't mind crying, this is definetly for you. A great movie and something you will definetly hold on to in your collection as of of the your favs.",1099872000,,2081,4.324808184143222
900127,5,6304578466,"The first time I saw The 6th Man was about 5 or 6 years ago.  I remember laughing so hard and also crying so hard.  Its a remarkable story about 2 brothers, one of which is dead.

900129,5,6304578466,"I love this movie. It's my all-time fav movie. Marlon Wayans is hott!. If you want a funny movie that makes you cry somethimes, this movie gives you that. It's about 2 basketball star brothers and one dies. But he comes back and he taunts (not haunts) his younger brother and makes him look like a fool in front of their basketball team. It's hilarious!!",984700800,2,354,4.461538461538462
900130,5,6304578466,"....Marlon Wayans and Kadeem Hardison will make you laugh over and over again. After a star college basketball player dies of a heart condition, his little brother must take the team leader role. The older brother comes back as a ghost (that only his brother can see) to lead the team to be one of the best in the nation. They pull off some great tricks on the other teams like making a opposing player who picks on his little brother shoot a free throw like a quarterback throws a pass. The 6th Man is an excellent comedy for anyone, especially teens.",978393600,5,552,4.421568627450981
