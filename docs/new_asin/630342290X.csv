641514,5,630342290X,"Wow!, this is an amazing viewing experience, and definitely the best Derek Jarman film that I've seen. The script is based on Christopher Marlowe's equally bizarre 16th century playscript, the story of King Edward II and his love for his favorite Gaveston.  Edward neglects all his princely duties of governing England so he can hang out with Gaveston and party. He also rejects the love of his wife, Queen Isabella from France. The leading nobles then conspire with Isabella to get rid of Gaveston, and eventually to depose Edward and murder him in a particularly gruesome manner.

Jarman retains the original Elizabethan language (don't worry, it's very accessible) but modernizes the setting to some extent, keeping the medieval castle, but updating the costumes and some props. Medieval and modern elements are mixed together in post-modern fashion. This is a very stylized and even symbolic production, although the story is more or less dramatically realistic. The original dialogue has been edited and shortened, in order to highlight the settings and gestures. The play is a visual and musical feast for the senses. Jarman's treatment of the play reminds me of Julie Taymor's TITUS (based on Shakespeare's Titus Andonicus) starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.

But be forewarned, this is not for the squeamish; there is lots of male nudity and even homosexual love making, although enough is hidden to keep the ""R"" rating. There is also a fair amount of violence.

The play's treatment of homosexuality is very interesting and complex. In Marlowe's original playscript, the homosexual nature of the relationship between Edward and Gaveston is fairly obvious yet not completely explicit----still rather veiled according to the customs of the time; Jarman, in contrast, foregrounds the homosexuality; at the same time he doesn't idealize Edward and Gaveston to make them innocent victims. In line with the original script, Edward is portrayed as criminally negligent in his duties as King. But the nobles who depose him are also corrupted by the desire for power, so there are no clear heroes or villains here. The play, however, questions the irrational prejudice of the nobles against homosexuality.

Well worth the time and money. This play will be especially interesting for fans of Shakespeare and English Renaissance drama. Jarman truly makes Edward II accessible, interesting, and relevant for a contemporary audience.",1127001600,72,2438,5.305699481865285

641516,5,630342290X,"Not for everyone, but a great film by a great film director and stylist. Edward 2 is the play by Christpher Marlowe (1564-1593), author of The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, and the presumed Shakespearean writer. This film presents a Jacobean style rendering of this play with very modern sets and costumes and truly a hightened gay sensibility.

641518,4,630342290X,"Definitely Derek Jarman's most refined film. That said, refined for Jarman is bizarre for most.
Based VERY loosely on Christopher Marlowe's play from 1592, however, should be viewed in its own light / right. Whereas it does tend to capture the wonderful Marlow language, this is no ""Shakespeare"" here! It's a brilliantly acted ensemble piece, set in Jarman's abstract vision of the world, with a core message that is as valid today as it must have been shocking then.
Jarman ""paints"" his film - as he always did - not in any logical manner or order, but like a mosaic of images, creating a whole and a statement - a strong statement about intolerance in this case.
This one might even be palatable for non-Jarman fans.",1005177600,6,718,4.7063492063492065
641519,4,630342290X,"First off, I have to say that this movie should not be viewed as a rendition of the Marlowe play, but as its own creation. If you are expecting a faithful adaptation, you will be disappointed. However, if you come to it without prejudice, it is an impressive cinematic work of scope and vision.
Jarman's directing style is not for everyone--plot continuity or story structure is not very important to him--but he crafts each scene of the film with such care and skill that the sensuousnes of the cinematography becomes the central point. The film is presented as a gallery of images: every shot is a painting. Everything is subordinated for the effect of these images: the narrative is presented in a series of symbols and allegories, switching between times, places, reality and fantasy, until it all blends together in a wonderful cascade of pure visual exhiliration. This movie is first and foremost an aesthetic experience: watch it for the sake of watching it, enjoy first and alalyze later.
Should you wish to analyze it after all, you will find that the seemingly aimless or irrelevant images are actually an integral part of the story, carefully distributed throughout. There is meaning in everything that is presented in the film, from the extraneous vision of an Apollo with a golden snake, to the huddle of Rugby players Edward's son stumbles upon during his midnight forays. It is telling that the final scene has the Queen and Mortimer sitting inside a cage, caked in flour, while the son (wearing a suit and his mother's earrings and listening to a walkman) dances on top. Jarman goes with the maxim ""a picture is worth a thousand words,"" and prefers to tell his story through abstract yet meaning-laden images.
Another approach that Jarman has to the play is taking literally the figurative language of it. Many of the images come from the words the characters say, adding new dimensions to the language. Thus, when in the play, Edward's actions are compared to that of a butcher, during those scenes in the film, he is literally a butcher: coat, knife and all.
There are also elements that are outside the play, such as the gay rights protests that form a background but necessary part of the movie. Injecting new interpretations to the text, Jarman's work is a comment on boith the modern and the ancient problems that intolerance causes. Substance is something this film has a-plenty, convention is something that it does not. Don't expect logic or an easily (if at all) understandable story, but do expect an aesthetic experience that you will remember.",1001376000,17,2572,4.8744292237442925
641520,5,630342290X,"I came across this film by chance, and it was on a German channel - yes, overdubbed. Even if my first watching was robbed of its original language, I was completely won by the director's mastery in creating such rich images unsing practically no 'background' at all. This simplicity puts characters forward and also makes the film look like a dream, a story --- as they should be told, leaving enough space to listeners/ viewers to imagine their own settings for the plot & its protagonists. It's at the same time thrilling and sad, sensual and merciless - a fantastic experience in all.",1000857600,6,587,4.70873786407767
641521,3,630342290X,"This film is very good at catching Marlowe's wordplay and the actors here are all well known and great at their craft.  The problem I had with this was Jarman's use of contemporary issues to illuminate the story of England's openly gay monarch.  Better correlations could have been drawn from then to now, not putting pro-gay protestors in the background.  Show us how Edward II's treatment by his family and subjects contributed to the kind of gay bashing that still goes on today, hundreds of years afterward.  I slightly recommend this film.",980985600,4,544,4.880434782608695
641522,2,630342290X,"I have heard of movies not living up to the book. I admit that Marlowe was a genious and his work must be hard to bring to life. But this is rediculous! It must have taken real talent to mess this exquisite masterpiece by the great Christopher Marlowe up. The movie seems to concentrate more on graphic images of Edward II's affair with Gaveston than anything else. The entrances, exits, and dialogues between the characters are jumpy and abrupt. But that is not even the worst! They delete so many vital scenes. They delete Gaveston's sorrowful dying speeches; they delete when Edward II shows some of his father Edward Longshanks' strength and crushes the 1st rebellion against him; they delete when Edward II uses diplomacy to stop France from aiding Mortimer and Isabella; they delete when Edward II finds religion; they delete Edward II's moving soliloquies that enable us to feel honest pity and sorrow for him once he has been defeated; they really gloss over the scene when Edward II's 17 year old son Edward III flips the tables, crushes his corrupt mother, has Mortimer put to death, and offers prayers to his murdered father. I think these people owe Christopher Marlowe a MAJOR apology for messing up his exquisite masterpiece.",974505600,7,1239,4.849056603773585

641681,5,630342290X,"This is by far one of my favorite films!  It truly portrays King Edward II of England according to Christopher Marlowe's play by the same name.  The film is sort of set like a play.  Tilda Swinton's performance as the queen is exquisite!  She is too cruel.  I like Edward II because he was gay and a non-conformist.  He came out at a very dangerous time in history; however, he had the guts to do it.  I like the modern costumes and the early British dialect.  I think what Derek Jarmen is saying by making the film in this way is that people's views about homsexuality have not changed much since the time of Edward II.  This film is a must have for anyone who is serious about great British cinema and for anyone who is gay.  Close-minded society could learn tolerance of other people's differences by watching Edward II.",1370822400,,823,4.426666666666667

641683,3,630342290X,"This time, more than most, I have to base my rating on my personal experience of the movie - knowing and welcoming the fact that others will see it differently.

Mostly, it didn't grab me. The only Elizabethan playwright I have for comparison is Shakespeare, and there is no comparison. Court intrigue doesn't work for me, and there's a lot of that. Reimagining old scripts with new social values rarely works for me, either, unless it's work like Aristophane's, Shakespeare's, or Wilde's, and transcends time. Jarman's emphasis on intimacy between men doesn't pull me in, either, even if it's a defensible reading of the script as written.

But, when Tilda Swinton appears, everything changes. This very changeable actress appears here in her ideal role: very feminine, and very strong. Her distinctive face dominates ever scene in which it appears: delicate and womanly, but a crystalline clarity of form that rivets the viewer's attention - as it should for drawing one's focus to this slow-developing character.

As a movie I might pay money to see, not so much. But, as a modern reimagining of the five hundred year old script, I find it surprisingly close the the original.

This is definitely NOT the movie I was looking for.",1288310400,3,356,4.0
641770,4,630342290X,"Being one of only two movies (as opposed to stage productions) based on the works of Christopher Marlowe (the other is the Richard Burton 1967 DOCTOR FAUSTUS), Derek Jarman's 1991 film of EDWARD II would be important for that reason alone. However there is more to the film than that. It's not only what meets the eye but what meets the ear that really counts. Like most of his films, Jarman shot EDWARD II on a shoestring and like many a theatre director turned filmmaker, he follows the time honored tradition of re-interpreting a classic play for the screen. The minimal settings and modern costumes, which were partially budgetary concerns, take some getting used to as does the overtly gay overtone that Jarman brings out which is not for the easily offended even though it can clearly be found in Marlowe's text. However, if you can get past that, then this EDWARD II can be a surprisingly rich and rewarding experience especially on repeated viewings.

After I have watched a film version of a Shakespeare play or in this case Marlowe, I like to run it through my sound system without the picture and just listen to the words and how the actors speak them. The cast for EDWARD II is very strong and their theatrical background comes through with most of Marlowe's lines. Shakespeare was regarded as a playwright when he died in 1616 while Marlowe was considered a poet when he was murdered in 1593. There is poetry in Marlowe's blank verse that even Shakespeare couldn't aspire to although he was the better writer overall. But I digress. With a trio of strong performances from Stephen Waddington, Tilda Swinton, and Nigel Terry, this version of EDWARD II has a raw power that is accentuated by Jarman's visuals and Simon Fisher-Turner's music. Forget the anachronisms like Annie Lennox or the appearance of Queer Nation and focus on the story of a flawed individual who like Othello, ""loved not wisely, but too well"".",1271116800,4,1926,4.783783783783784
641771,5,630342290X,This excellent play is for mature audience only.  Shocking.  This will haunt you in your nightmares.  Yet from it came some of the best of english monarchy.  The future king owned his mother and childhood and was one of the best english kings.,1266537600,,243,4.5813953488372094
641772,4,630342290X,"Maybe you know Edward II from Braveheart.  He's the son of the nasty King Edward I who conquered Scotland and Wales.  He was gay, though his official responsibilities required him to have a wife and children (Edward III was his son).  His male lover, Piers Gaveston, was contemptuous of the aristocracy of England, giving them nasty nicknames that make Edward laugh uproariously.  So the queen and *her* lover plotted to get rid of Edward, and they did in a *very* nasty way.  This is all done in modern day surroundings, with the gay lovers smoking modern cigarettes (note--there was no tobacco in England in the 1300s).

This film is not for the squeamish.  Very explicit scenes of homosexual sex acts.  If you're a high school or even college teacher, this will NOT be appropriate for your general classes to learn about English history.  It might be appropriate for an advanced drama class, but even then you should go carefully, giving the class adequate warning about what they're going to see.

641773,1,630342290X,"My fault, I guess: I knew it was a Derek Jarman film, (usually a bit hit and miss) and I knew it was a film of a play by Christopher Marlowe, (B-grade Shakespeare).
Unfortunately Edward II was made during that beloved '80's fad, when they chose miss-matched costumes and sets from historical periods that supposedly suited individual characters and situations. Usually a ruse to make tired old productions seem more 'hip' and relevant. (It would seem that no more worthy material has been written since Elizabethan times, so we have to keep flogging the old stuff to death!)
In this case, the selection of various 20th century costumes generally served to reinforce the essence of each character, and created images which are easily recognised by the modern T.V. and movie audience.
However, the choice of sets was clearly influenced completely by more mundane budgetary concerns.
A strong cast was totally let down by the director's inability to translate the original play from the stage, to a screen format.
The cardboard sets would have been drab and claustrophobic even in a theatre. No effort was made to open the production out by using the cinematic tricks and locations that a modern-day audience expects.
At least the D.V.D. viewer can fall asleep in the privacy and comfort of their own home, without the embarassment that theatre-goers might have endured!
The historical accuracy was always going to be limited by the source material, but thanks to Jarman's format, lack of locations etc., I learned no more about Edward II, or even the later era of Shakespeare, than I have from researching books and the internet.
As is often the case, a dramatic and interesting true subject, although treated badly, will now be left alone by other film-makers, with the viewing public ultimately the poorer because of Derek Jarman's effort.",1264291200,4,1839,5.0130718954248366
641774,4,630342290X,"An avant-garde film that won't appeal to all tastes, Derek Jarman's ""Edward II"" takes Christopher Marlowe's Shakespearean-era play and imbues it with a modern sensibility.  The minimal sets look as though they were thrown together in an abandoned warehouse or airplane hangar, and successfully convey a stifling atmosphere of labyrinthine darkness, decadence, and murder most foul.

As Edward II, Steven Waddington does what he can with a role that seems to be seriously underwritten.  Not having read the original play, I'm not sure if that's attributable to Marlowe or to Derek Jarman (who also co-wrote the screenplay), but Edward never emerges as much more than a character on a page: there's nothing much ""kingly"" about him, he's not terribly bright, and his motivations seem to change, depending on the scene.  Far more successful, I thought, was Andrew Tiernan, as the flashier, much-despised lover of the king, Piers Gaveston.  Tiernan plays Gaveston as a fop with an attitude, a scheming, snarky twink with dollar signs in his eyes, and a block of ice for a heart.  He plays up to poor, dimwitted Edward, making him believe that he loves him, but the only person Gaveston cares about is Gaveston.  He's presented as a villain, but he's certainly no worse than Nigel Terry's power-hungry Mortimer, whose own scheming, and canoodling with Edward's sex-starved Queen Isabella (Tilda Swinton), have devastating consequences.  Terry, a veteran actor, turns in a fine performance here, while Swinton (one of only a handful of actors I'd characterize as ""luminous"") has never been more breathtaking; her Isabella is regal and proper, but with fire blazing beneath the cultivated fashionista veneer.  Jarman's partner, Kevin Collins, has a key role as the jailer, and he makes the most of it.  His ability to convey the deepest emotions with minimal dialogue is both moving and impressive.  And Annie Lennox has a brief, beautiful scene as a singer, which only made me wish that she had a bigger part, because she's got a terrific presence.

At the end of the day, ""Edward II"", while not a perfect film, is far from a waste of time.  It's sort of like Shakespeare with a kink, an under-developed, yet mesmerizing, foray into royal intrigue that links its subject matter to modern issues (AIDS, gay liberation) while eschewing the tired casting of porno coverboys as the principal male leads.  The film is commendable on a number of levels, and its shortcomings are overshadowed by Jarman's fine direction and vision, by many of the performances, and by the overall quality of the production.",1231113600,3,2592,5.068235294117647

Film is about King Edward II who upon his father's death and inheritance to power invites from exile his lover, Galveston.  Court is appalled that Galvaston is all that Edward II can think about and that Edward does not care that his lover is cruel, uncaring and greedy and steals money from the treasury.  Edward's wife and Queen is rejected upon Galveston's arrival and finds herself on the sideline of power.  Born of noble blood, she is deeply hurt by her treatment by the King and decides to plot a revenge and take over the power herself.

Fantastic costumes and jewelry.  Queen's makeup is amazing, she is hypnotizing to all but Edward.  This performance feels more like theatre on DVD.  Annie Lennox's musical performance is beautiful and quite unexpected.

Film will get everyone thinking about lure of power and wealth, desire to hang onto it no matter what the consequences.  It also tackles the notion of double standards.  While homosexuality is frawned upon, the murder, orgy, adultery and betrayal seem to be almost expected and accepted by the great majority or realm's subjects. This film is not for everyone.

641776,5,630342290X,"As playwright Christopher Marlowe is considered to be the first Elizabethan Tragedian, and therefore pioneer to the up and coming Shakespeare (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-in-Love/dp/B00000JGOH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare in Love</a>&nbsp;for an excellent film treatment of this subject), the late Derek Jarman, Fellow of the British Film Institute for his lifelong contribution to British Cinema, can be viewed as a ""pioneer"" for filmmakers who dared to be unusual, visionary and quite controversial and unconventional in style and interpretation.  Jarman's body of work is impressive, and breathes with the life of someone who simply must do it film his own way.  For me, Jarman has become an acquired taste over the years, but a taste that lingers on the palate and goes down with absolute clarity of digestion.  It was not always so!

In 1991, Jarman, and his dear friend, now Academy Award winning actress Tilda Swinton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Clayton-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00121QGPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)</a>) along with many film associates from the BFI (Sally Potter, Terence Davies, Bill Douglas and Peter Greenaway) were revolutionary visionaries in creating art on the screen that has had an impact on many present day filmmakers who wish to be craftsmen and not tradesmen. In that year, Jarman adapted the famous late 1500's Marlowe tragedy on the life, infatuations,and fatal weaknesses and incompetence of the 1300's King Edward 2 of England, and their devastating consequences to his life and country. Marlowe, himself, a complete rebel in his day, who died a violent and bitterly early death in a tavern brawl in 1594, seemed the perfect writer for the similar Jarman to interpret on the large screen....and WHAT AN INTERPRETATION IT IS!  Adapting Marlowe's play, which was itself handled with considerable liberty by subordinating historical accuracy to dramatic effect, is vivid and unforgettably stylish and downright in-your-face sexual, as WAS in fact King Edward 2, known for his love for entertainment and squander, and his chronicled loves with at least two men, Piers Gaveston and Hugh Despencer whom he bestowed lavish attention, wealth and titles to such ignobly born fellows, thus igniting the fury of the Catholic Church, the Court Nobility, and his Queen, Isabella.  The play is Marlowe's words, but the rendering is all Jarman, as Jarman, who was Gay himself, never shies from presenting Edward (Steven Waddington) as the tortured King, in a most disagreeable alliance/marriage (as was the custom!) with Isabella (Swinton) and his lust, love and adoration for his lover, Gaveston (Andrew Tiernan) and later Despencer (John Lynch).  Isabella also has HER lover, Mortimer (Nigel Terry), who along with Isabella seeks to rule the realm through Edward and Isabella's son the young puppet, Edward 3.

Now that is the story, and those are the historical events.....BUT this is a Derek Jarman film, and history is shown to us in a way that is so provocative, from blatant sexual imagery, unconventional costuming that places the play as a commentary on Margaret Thatcher's Conservative late 1980's England, and minimalist scenery, designed by Christopher Hobbs (a great favorite of The British Film Institute) to evoke the barrenness of an Age where Church and Nobility ruled, and where pleasure and desire, though enjoyed to the hilt by all, is attacked and condemned in the form of homosexuality, and used as the excuse for deposing a recklessly viewed Monarch.

Often, I am entranced with historical Period Pieces, but often find that the retelling of said events can be rather dry and unmemorable.  Not so with Jarman's film whose sense of injustice at how his own sexuality is eschewed is mesmerizingly transferred to the big screen with imagery that explodes graphically before your eyes.  In fact, the imagery was so graphic and innovative that the film lingered in my emotions and not simply in my intellect!  Not one ounce of Marlowe's play of lust and betrayal is lost, and IMO, Marlowe's rebel spirit which infuses his work, is best served by Jarman's understanding of Marlowe's intent on explaining the life of the tortured King and Marlowe's intense hatred for the nobility.

There are the anachronisms of sumptuous modern costumes for the leads - especially Tilda Swinton (runway-model manque) - and lavish yet pared-down sets that make you concentrate on the glorious words of Christopher Marlowe.

It is gory and violent, stunning and outrageous, sexually explicit, and very political and pro-gay activism.

Steven Waddington and Andrew Tiernan make convincing lovers and Tilda Swinton is outstanding as the spurned wife and ultimate murderer of her husband.

It must be remembered that Derek Jarman started out as the set designer for Ken Russell's ""The Devils"" and this is demonstrated by the stylistic and stylised sets.  Annie Lennox makes a brief but poignant appearance and all the supporting actors and actresses are entirely convincing.

Everything about this production stank, from its bastardizing of Marlow's lines, to its casting, to its setting and sets, everything.

The original text of Christopher Marlowe might well have been lent to a production questioning the brutal end said to have been inflicted on Edward II because of his sexuality.  However, this movie *underscores* the supposed bestiality of the King, of Gaveston (presented here as a virulently awful creature whose allure is maddeningly, entirely inexplicable) ... and thereby seems to agree with the notion that homosexuality is repugnant and ought to be brutally punished.  How baffling, then, that this film has gained the reputation for being gay positive in any way.

Every last character in this production is a villain; but the king and his favorites are imbued with a special sort of loathsomeness.  Had Gaveston been presented with the slightest human dignity, or had Steven Waddington's performance been allowed to display even a hint of integrity or strength, this movie might well have been a great one.  Unfortunately, they and everyone around them are hateful, brutal, selfish and conniving.

The performances are universally wretched, which points a finger at the director, not his actors. The editing, both of the source material and of the film itself, appears to be nearly arbitrary. The art direction is either murky or the DVD transfer is abysmal.  The perfect absence of sympathy for ANY of the characters is tiresome, not challenging.  As it stands, the artiness is all this film has left to offer - and that is rather dated now, and not terribly engaging.  When I have enough mental slack while watching a movie to take time to wonder why the poet changed from one pair of reading glasses to another just because some new characters entered the scene, and do not even CARE about the answer, that movie has failed to capture my attention.

I let ten years lapse between my first viewing and my second, and I returned to this film because I believe in second chances.  This was worse the second time, worse than ""Howard the Duck"".

""Edward II"" (1991) directed by Derek Jarman is a variation on Christopher Marlowe's 16th-century play ""The Troublesome Reign of Edward II"" which tells the story of England openly gay King Edward, and his relationship with Piers Gaveston that bitterly angers his queen, Isabella of France, ""The French She-Wolf"", and eventually leads to his fall - he will lose his Kingdom and his life. If I had not known that Jarman was a painter and a Caravaggio admirer, I would've guessed immediately after first 5 minutes or so. His usage of light and shadows was amazing. His lack of historical settings and staging the film among the bare walls as well as including many anachronisms, such as modern clothes and cigarette smoking gave the old story timeless feel. Tilda Swinton as a woman scorned never looked so ethereal and breathtakingly beautiful. For her acting, she won the best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1991. ""Edward II"" is a gripping film that is in the same league as Julie Taymor's stunning adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Titus"" but it is certainly not for everyone.

641843,5,630342290X,"This is a very well made, interesting, and unique interpretation of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II.  It is by Derek Jarman, one of the most neglected British filmmakers in history.  This is best known film in the US, and while he's made better films, this one is still excellent.  The first time you see the film it can be rather off putting.  First of all, the characters wear contemporary clothes (even though it took place in the 14th century), and they smoke cigarettes.  The film is very stylized, there are some rather heavygoing sex scenes at the beginning of the film, and there are appearances by OutRage, a British gay rights group that Jarman was a member of.  Aside from the anarchorisms and the sex, it still feels like a Shakespeare play in many ways.  It is interesting to note that in Mel Gibson's film Braveheart, the son of Edward Longshanks was, in fact, Edward II.  In Mel's film, he was portrayed in a stereotypical, effeminate way.  In Jarman's film, Edward is much more dynamic and intelligent.  Jarman's portrayal, while a little idealised, is still more realistic than Gibson's film.  Granted, Gibson wasn't making a film about Edward II, but it still would have been good of him to get the portrayal right.  The other performances are top notch (especially Tilda Swinton as the jilted queen, and Nigel Terry as Mortimer).  Annie Lennox singing ""Every Time We Say Goodbye"" is reminiscent of Jarman's film of The Tempest, when Elisabeth Welch sings Stormy Weather at the end.  Everything in this film works.  It sounds like it could go out of control and turn into a camp fest, but it never does.  Well worth seeing...",1152748800,24,1643,4.773049645390071

7846214,4,630342290X,"This film came out four centuries after the first performance of the play and in a way sealed Jarman's fate since Marlowe was assassinated in 1593 and Jarman will be killed by AIDS in 1994, four hundred and one year after Marlowe's death. There is no fate in the world, but yet things can be well arranged from time to time.

The film has both little to do with the play and yet is quite close to it. The play itself reduces the political dimension of a feudal king who is all-powerful, theoretically, though this power has been reduced by the Magna Carta in 1215, to some tyrannical whimsical fancy of real authority. In fact the play is the squeezing of fifteen years of history in just five acts, more or less crushing any temporal perspective down and this makes the personal love affair of the King for Gaveston and then the close connection to the Despenser family, in both cases denying the privileged position and authority of the peers, the dominant affair. We must also note the play was discreet about the role of the church, apart from the first banishment imposed by the Pope at the request of the peers because the King then did not respect the balance established in the Magna Carta.

Derek Jarman goes a lot farther since he erases the political dimension of the last scene in which Edward III has Mortimer executed in the most violent but ""legal"" way for the killing of his father and his mother imprisoned pending her trial as an accomplice to this murder. The young king in the film dances to some music from his MP3 reader on the cage containing Mortimer and his mother covered in waste. Edward III is wearing his mother's earrings, a fact that was also used in the previous scene when his own mother bit his uncle, Edward II's brother, at the jugular and drinks his blood like a vampire till death ensues. These earrings are the sign of the dependence of the child on the mother and become at the end, with the mother in the cage, a symbol of the continuation of the curse in this family that does not seem to clearly differentiate male from female and that is not only a question of sexual orientation. In a way that erases the feudal crime of Mortimer who seizes power or at least tries to by having himself appointed protector of the realm till the new king is of age to reign, though the protector should have been the uncle.

But this rewriting of this last scene is in continuation with the emphasis all along set on the sexual issue, on Gaveston and then Spencer, on the gay aspect of things including with anachronistic scenes like a gay-rights demonstration repressed by riot police in England and the last words come from Edward II on the still background of this repressed demonstration swept by the camera:

""Death ends all and I can die but once. Come, Death, and with thy fingers close my eyes, and if I live let me forget myself.""

Jarman uses all moments and occasions in the film to set the emphasis on the sexual gay dimension of the situation the way he sees it. The bishop, we assume of Canterbury, is imprisoned and tortured to death. Gaveston is over-explicit on the vengeance he wants to get and the killing of the peers he wants to perform. In fact in these moments the king appears more moderate than he actually was because he was really trying to bring England back to the absolute almighty feudal king of old in the absolute feudal order of hierarchical domination of a not so distant past.

Jarman creates a very dark and menacing atmosphere by having many scenes in the underground foundations of some airless and lightless dungeons in a castle, and some of these scenes show the King imprisoned in such underground dump in which all wasted water, grey and black alike, are rejected in a pool that covers the whole ground and in which the king is supposed to live while he is prevented from sleeping by constant drumming day and night. These prison scenes interspersed in the whole film make the plot very awkward since there is no plot any more with these flash-forwards that tell the end before it ever could be envisaged. And this dark subterranean world is invaded and dominated by all kinds of military personnel in modern attire and equipment. We deal here with one characteristic of Derek Jarman's cinematographic art: the art of anachronistic references. From the very start we have cigarettes, then Big Ben's chimes, then those modern uniforms, then modern weapons, then the prince is playing with robots. There is no end to such anachronistic elements or props The intended meaning is that nothing has ever changed.

But in fact this accumulation of elements that are not connected to the play, its time, even its subject create a completely different atmosphere today, at the time of the Internet and smart phones: it creates some timelessness that also implies some non-reality in the discourse. Instead of making the discourse eternal, valid for all times, it makes it non-temporal, out of time, hence virtual, hence unreal, hence purely fictitious. It is a vision, the vision of the subject in the eye of Derek Jarman, the beholder who wants to make us beholders in order to receive his meaning. But we do not. In fact the political dimension, including gay rights, is totally erased or veiled or hidden by the dark, tortuous, perverted world we are given to see: the people at all levels and all of them are perverted, including the King who forgets who he is and his responsibilities towards the peers, his family, his wife, his son, the church, etc. He is a perverse feudal ruler.

Including Gaveston who forgets who and what he is. He is from France, from the lower levels of feudal society trying to dominate and get some revenge from the top layers of the English feudal society, and thus he becomes a perverted social climber. Spencer, in a way, is more respectable because he does not want anything from the King. He is at the King's service and provides the King with the care he needs.

Including all the peers, church people and nobles alike, who are all perverted because they want to defend their privileges, their power, their social position without taking into account anyone else: they only speak of themselves and never of the people without whom they would be nothing. They are perverted feudal barons who have forgotten they are the protectors and the providers of their serfs and villains.

Including of course the church who rants and raves about some kind of fictitious power of God or the church itself. Gaveston on that point is right when he rejects the See of Rome and calls it the See of Hell. But then Derek Jarman goes one step further of course and when the Queen is in bed with Mortimer, while the King from whom she cannot have been divorced since divorce is not recognized by the church at the time, the aforesaid Mortimer is reading a book (anachronistically of course) entitled ""Unholy Babylon."" The meaning actually is lost because we only see the Babylon of Saint John's Apocalypse but here it precisely means the couple is adulterous, the power they assume is usurped, illegally possessed, the rank they appropriate is stolen. What's more the title of the book is redundant. Babylon is by definition unholy. But in Saint John's Apocalypse Babylon is Rome. Do we keep this connection? Is that intended to be an accusation against Rome, against the Catholic church?

In other words Jarman is overdoing it.

The transformation of the Prince from a discreet and invisible voyeur who can see things without being seen, into a mother's child, wearing her hat, her earrings and even her shoes on the cage at the end is pathetic and deeply unfaithful to Marlowe. This Edward III should be the restoration of order, law and order, authority, the expulsion of the perverted and rotten fruits or eggs from the basket. From the capricious authoritarian love affairs of Edward II we shift here to a childish whimsical tyrannical brothel of sorts in which the perverse sexual desires of Edward III will be totally assumed and satisfied. The realm is falling one full subterranean hell-scraper down with this Edward III.

The vision then is not historical. It might be a very beautiful artistic vision, but it has nothing to do with Marlowe, the real king or kings behind the period, the real stakes in England at the time. Marlowe was already very short on these questions, but Jarman betrays not only Marlowe but also Shakespeare who wrote Edward III the same year as Marlowe's Edward II, and above all history in general and this historical period in particular. History is never made by a few people. It is always made by the people itself and themselves. History is of the people, by the people and for the people. Jarman is presenting a story of his own invention, by his own artistic means and for his own aesthetic pleasure or satisfaction.

It's sad because Jarman definitely knew how to produce great cinematographic art, but his intention in this film is not so much beauty but what he considers as his truth which is after all nothing but one point of view in a post modern world and that makes Jarman a one-pointed mind that misses the multiplicity of our modern spirit, mind, vision, daily experience. There is no truth indeed but many points of view.

As a song says in the film, Jarman has changed history and Marlowe's play ""from major to minor"" but here not ""every time we say goodbye,"" rather from the very start and till the very end. The film is in minor tone and as such misses the multi-tonal music of today.
