4698970,5,B005H0OEJ6,"i got the bleach fade to black dvd today.i had already seen the movie in japanese like two years ago so i know how the movie is. hands down this movie is one of the best anime movie ive ever seen. the movie has such a good plot and seems a lot more fresh than other anime movies. aside from the great content of the movie, the actual dvd itself is a little bare compared to the other bleach movies. first you can only order the movie with it having one disk. the first two bleach movies had two.the case doesn't have a cover and it just feels a little rushed for a anime movie to be so vaccant in the sense that you are literally only getting the movie itself. i don't know if this is a problem for most people but i personally like to have my movies pimped out a little bit. in all a must buy for bleach fans.",1321660800,,810,3.9754601226993866
4698971,5,B005H0OEJ6,Definitely my favorite movie so far as it was well passed and written. I honestly would have like to have seen this story line as a filler arc rather then in movie format.  It would have been nice to see more behind the scenes and flash back for several of the characters.,1321574400,,272,4.230769230769231
4698972,5,B005H0OEJ6,"I won't give too much away, but Bleach:Fade to Black, I Call Your Name is a great film that follows Ichigo Kurosaki and his  ""friend"" Kon as they fights to restore the lost memories to  Rukia and the Soul Reapers, save his friend Rukia from being held captive, and battle the two strange people responsible for it all.  It features good animation, great sound effects, good and interesting story, and great voice acting, aside from Kisuke Urahara, who sounded ... weird somehow, like it was a different actor or the actor who voices him on the show, Michael Lindsay, was speaking differently... But that aside, it was a great film and it gives some new background info on Rukia as well. I saw this film when it was delivered to my house from Right Stuf.com on the 12th of November, and was very happy with the film. If your a Bleach anime fan ,you'll will definitely like this movie, make sure you see it. As a side  note, there are not many special features like the last 2 films had , but Bleach: Fade to Black, I Call Your Name is still worth a 5 out of 5!",1321315200,,1059,4.333333333333333
4698973,5,B005H0OEJ6,"While the 4th movie was awesome and cool, what with all the fights and fantastic animation, it lacked a complex story. This movie has the same level of animation quality as the fourth one but with a complex and well thought out story. Compared to when the series first started Rukia has so much more detail that she looks totally different, in a good way. The fact that they don't tell you what is going on at the beginning (like they did in the 4th one) keeps the mystery going, and keeps you interested in the story. I would not recommend this to anyone who has not read through Volume 21 or seen through episode 63. Even then there will be a few things you might not totally get, although it will not impact the story very much. I highly recommend this movie, it is definitely worth the money.",1318809600,5,796,4.348993288590604

4698975,4,B005H0OEJ6,"Fade to Black is the third of the Bleach full length movies and an improvement over Diamond Dust Rebellion. While I still think Memories of Nobody was the best of the movies, this one offers a few reasons to watch and enjoy. As with the other movies, Fade to Black brings in your favorite characters, an interesting enough plot, and a step-up from the series in terms of art and fluidity of the animation. Fans of the series will find this to be a welcome addition to the Bleach universe, particularly as Rukia plays a central role in the film. Aside from her added screen time (which I loved, as she was one of the reasons I started watching the series to begin with) there are bits and pieces of her background that are filled in throughout the story. All this and her ""transformation"" make this a film well crafted for its faithful audience.

That being said, I do have a few gripes that don't necessarily take away too much (and are rather characteristic of the series in general) but that bug me nonetheless. First, as in Diamond Dust Rebellion (and to a lesser extent in Memories of Nobody), there is a bit too much overly-emotional sermonizing. While the core canon of the Bleach series (those episodes based off the manga) contain little of this, the side stories and movies seem to add it for filler. Again, this is nothing new, but it steals a little from the drama. Second, this film sets up interesting questions about the limits of ""humanness"" (or, personhood might be a better term) on par with those that Kube brings out through Memories of Nobody and through the Arrancar and their seeming humanity, but just as in that narrative arc there is little down to delve into the question. It is presented (imaginatively so) to the viewer, but is left to hang their unexplored and unresolved. Again, this doesn't hurt the quality too much, but once I would like to see Tite Kubo raise the dramatic tension a bit more.

Oh, and the fights are awesome. But you knew that already.",1314576000,10,1986,4.575842696629214
4698976,5,B005H0OEJ6,"I love Bleach - and I happen to be a very, very fussy person - if the story doesn't hook me in the first few minutes, it loses me. I've seen every Bleach episode, plus the OMAs, fillers, and read the Manga, so that should tell you how good the story is. Since I haven't seen the latest movie yet in order to rate them I can only stand this one up against the first two, and of the three, this is the best of them. So to make it brief - IT'S ABOUT ***** TIME!!!! I'll be getting this one the second it's released!",1314144000,13,512,3.8857142857142857
4698977,5,B005H0OEJ6,"This movie starts with everyone in the Soul Society suddenly forgetting Rukia. Rukia was the Soul Reaper that gave Ichigo (the main character) his powers. No one would know Ichigo if not for Rukia, so everyone forgets Ichigo. The fights between Ichigo and the Captains are amazing. The Mystery of why everyone has forgotten Rukia and Ichigo is very well thought out. I watched this movie when it first came out with English subtitles so I can tell you. This buy is totally worth it even if it is a random buy. Bleach is an amazing series. I would highly recommend that you buy the boxsets for the series as well. With Cool epic fights, a very well thought out story, and very interesting characters developments and types you love this series and all four of its movies that are out. I hope this helped your decision.",1314144000,36,817,4.5646258503401365

4698982,4,B005H0OEJ6,"I love this movie, truly one of the most interesting because of its plot, and seeing Rukia in such an interesting light. Truly a film that deserved a far better box set than what it got...

Here's what I mean, all of the Bleach films in Japan had incredible box sets upon release, all of them containing dozens of material and each in a 3 disc set. Of course it stands to reason that the U.S. can't quite do the same, so the first two films, Memories of Nobody and Diamond Dust Rebellion, had their own very nearly packaged box sets, even booklets just like the ones you'd get if you watched the film over in Japan. MoN even had a staff commentary which was nice to hear, DDR not so much but still had plenty of content within the discs. So I figured the trend would continue with Fade to Black, and what did we get...? One disc, no second cover like the first 2 had, not much of any content, no booklet, and the SADDEST excuse of a home menu I have EVER seen. Someone at Viz did not care about this movie, and it shows, and it makes me sad that they would do this to ANY film they released, and FtB did not deserve such a horrible U.S. release. This film is too good for what Viz had done to it. I can't say for any other films Viz has released, I've only ever bought the Bleach films, Hell Verse included, even that one was equally botched with the U.S. release, but at least the menu looked great. It's just so sad to see stuff like that happen.

But in any case, the film itself anyone can enjoy regardless, I was just ranting about the packaging and content, it truly deserved so much more.",1437004800,,1595,4.175324675324675

4698992,5,B005H0OEJ6,"Just finished watching ""Bleach - The Movie - Fade To Black"" released by VIZ Media.
Bleach is one of my favorite anime series, filled with complicated on-going story lines and intriguing plot twists.
""Bleach - The Movie - Fade To Black"" I'm happy to say won't disappoint fans, like myself, of the series.
Memory and the importance of one person in the lives of many is the cental to this movie.
Rukia has been kidnapped and all memory of her has been erased from the memory of all members of the Soul Society.  Seireitei has been devasted and is under attack from two unkown sources of great power.  Worse yet, nobody in Soul Society remembers Ichigo who must not only mount a one-man rescue mission to save Rukia; but he must dodge attempts to capture and kill him.
Highly Recommended!

4699004,4,B005H0OEJ6,"My only problems with this movie are that there's a whole lot of talking in the beginning, and the big group fight toward the end is very reminiscent of the battle in the 2nd movie.  Watching the Soul Reaper characters fight with altered memories is very dramatic.  The main antagonists of the movie are quite annoying at first, but their story is quite touching.  As for how their tale concludes, it's a beautiful move that might leave you almost teary.  Ichigo can be a pretty plain character, and Rukia always needs saving, but both of them have personal struggles in this movie that make them feel more likeable.  While the previous Bleach movies felt like 80-minute episodes, this stands on its own as a film with a meaningful structure.

As usual, this story does not fit into the canon of the actual Bleach story at all, but it doesn't matter because the emotional conflict is quite believable. And the atmosphere of the Soul Society is still quite vivid.

Another complaint is that the picture has been cropped simply and quickly.  I assume this is because Japanese TVs are 1.66:1 instead of 16:9, but they didn't bother to edit the frames to look better.  Heads and feet are frequently just off your TV, and it looks silly.

Still, it looks quite amazing on Blu-Ray, even compared to the anime, which has recently gone HD in America.  Although you couldn't tell by the box art, there's some fantastic colors and effects.  I will probably give this one a rewatch sometime down the road, so it's not a bad purchase at all.",1374019200,,1529,4.643122676579925

This movie was amazing though. It's all about if Rukia was forgotten, almost like she never existed what would have happened. If your a fan of Ichigo and Rukia together this movie will definitely make you smile a bit. Ichgio tries to make everyone remember her and in turn it's mostly him trying tog get her back.  I don't want to give it away but there are these tow siblings who are the cause of Rukia being forgotten, just know there a lot more interesting and deep then they first appear...
The animation and music seemed to be vamped up in this movie as well in fact which made it more enjoyable. Also the fights weren't classic Bleach long and boring  they were short and to the point.

Buy it, 'cos you'd want to watch it more than once, it's the only good Bleach movie. Hits all the spots.

*Spoiler alert - please don't read on if you don't want more details*

Somebody finally figured out that the only characters most people care about are Ichigo, Rukia and Kon. Orihime, Sado, and that Quincy don't appear in this movie at all - good news to me, bad news to those of you who like 'em. Yes, KON the stuffed toy gets a major role, and the Kon moments are so good, you'd want to hit replay. What are you waiting for? All the captains appear in this one, and they get to fight in above-average fight sequences, Byakuya included. Plus, the theme song by Porno Graffiti is one of those you have to buy after hearing it. Great animation for end titles, too. And did I mention it has lots of Kon the stuffed toy?",1332806400,,1116,4.4926108374384235
4699031,5,B005H0OEJ6,"I am a fan of Bleach, so I decided to pick up this movie.  The movie is great, it has nice animation, the sounds are good, and the plot is action packed.  I have seen the first three movies of Bleach and this movie comes close to being my favorite one.  I won't spoil the plot for those who haven't watched this movie yet, but if you were wondering if you should pick it up, I would highly recommend it.",1330646400,,403,4.0125
4699032,5,B005H0OEJ6,"I haven't seen Hell Chapter yet, but I really liked this one and so did my daughter. Storyline was much stronger than the first two. Subtitles and the dubbing don't match quite often, but that's understandable; exact translations are impossible to begin with, and they really make an effort to make the words match the lips. Much better than the joke translations from the old Godzilla movies where the on screen actor obviously had a long speech and what you heard was a one or two word statement or the the other way around.

In any case, it's an enjoyable ""side arc"" that doesn't bend the storyline of the main series completely out of whack.",1328745600,,645,4.608695652173913
4699033,5,B005H0OEJ6,"Ive seen the movie sub titled and loved it, if only for the action which only evolves as the series goes on. The story is great and involves each of the characters from the show, typical anime fasion continues but this is why we watch to see how everything ends up and I ultimatley feel bleach gives the characters enough development to make there break through in emotions feel real and makes the impact of them breaking a wall all the more satisfying. Music hits all the right notes and Kon feels of use in this being the voice of reason given rukias current situation he is very close to her so hes the best bet to freeing her its awesome",1327795200,,641,4.305785123966942
4699034,5,B005H0OEJ6,"I first saw this movie a couple of years ago when it was released on youtube with english subtitles and I thought it was very good, I have yet to see the dubbed version but it will undoubtedly be good.  I wouldn't consider this the best Bleach movie though, that is a difficult tie between movie 2: the Diamond Dust Rebellion and movie 4: Hell Chapter, despite not being the best it is still a very good movie. for anyone that is as much of a fan as me I would also recommend watching movie 4 on youtube with english subtitles",1327190400,2,526,4.207920792079208
4699035,4,B005H0OEJ6,"I thought the movie was great. the only issue i had was that i couldn't take the subtitle off. i tried doing it in the set-up, but it would come back when i start the movie.

Any one had this isse and know a way to get rid of it? it annoying since i am watching it in english, i don't need the subtitle too. And not to mention the subtitles don't always match the audio.",1326672000,,370,3.8684210526315788
4699036,5,B005H0OEJ6,This is a very good movie and it is hard to review. If you are a fan of bleach then you know what I am talking about. The characters by name are hard for me to spell. The movie do ends and it is not a to be continue movie. It has lots of action and it will hold your attention .I would recommend this movie to watch.,1326412800,,316,3.661764705882353

4699043,5,B005H0OEJ6,"The third movie in the Bleach series makes 2nd spot on my top favorites of all 4 of the movies released so far, with Movie 4: Hell Chapter being my favorite so far.

The movie itself is pretty good, it kept me entertained, the voice actors are fantastic so I'd give it a 4/5 - My only real complaint is that Kon got a new voice actor in this movie

I give the movies packaging/case and special features a 3/5 - The case it came in was your typical black case which is no problem, it just seemed really flimsy, sort of like how Viz Media released Shippuden Bonds but again it wasn't a problem with me at all. The special features on this movie are just a few trailers and I believe a production board sketch or something, which neither of those are very special but like before it wasn't a big problem in my opinion at all either. Overall this was a good movie and for under $19.99 you really can't go wrong, I payed $14.99 where I bought mine.",1323648000,,943,4.175824175824176

the story (from the beginning) is amazing, and the movies are always well done. this one is the better of the 3 ive seen so far, although they're all good.

if you love Bleach youve already seen this movie or are about to buy it.

if you don't love Bleach...why are you standing close to me? ^^",1323216000,2,388,4.216216216216216
4699045,3,B005H0OEJ6,"TO start off i am a huge bleach fan. I love both movies the first being my fav.the wait for this movie has been long very very long. I bought blu ray verison of fade to black and put it in the ps3 right when i got home.
 The blu ray looks great the colors are bight and crisp no complaints here. The story is this movies biggest weakness, it was boring the only thing that saved this movie was the fight scenes(ichigo vs renji) and those seemed few and far between. i had a lot of hope for this movie as i read a bunch of positive reviews. while it serves its purpose, it just falls short. if you are a bleach fan its watchable. i hope the wait for the 4th movie is better and is released quicker then this one.",1323043200,,711,3.972027972027972
4699046,5,B005H0OEJ6,"This movie is a perfect complement to the series. The plot is heartfelt and not contrived. Nearly every favorite Bleach character makes a cameo in this film. It's also a delight to see a full-scale battle employing all of the Captains. The animation is consistent throughout most of the film, though some of the renderings of Rukia early on don't look quite accurate. Still well worth adding to your collection.",1322524800,,411,4.885714285714286
4699047,5,B005H0OEJ6,"Bleach the Movie: Fade to Black;  A story twist I did not see coming, i think I have become used to Ichigo constantly evolving power, so I was not thrilled with the movie.  But overall still Bleach enough for any fan",1322265600,,216,4.2439024390243905
8472553,4,B005H0OEJ6,"Of all the Bleach movies this one is probably my favorite. It doesn't stomp too hard on the canon story line from the manga. It has better animation than most of the others and focuses on characters that you actually care about and not so much on the made up ones just for the movie.

Of course there are things I wish they had done differently, but overall the movie is a really good tribute to the original manga with a decent original story line.

I paid less than retail and it was still probably too much, but I really wanted it. Wait for it to go on sale and you won't be disappointed in buying it.",1525219200,,604,4.153846153846154
