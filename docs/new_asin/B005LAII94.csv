4767973,4,B005LAII94,"Don't read this review. Don't read any of the reviews. Don't even watch the previews or trailers because they all pretty much sell the movie wrong anyway. Just go see Savages.

If you want to know a little more, you'll probably just get turned off or confused in the process.  Just watch the movie instead.

Savages is bloody, outrageous, unbelievable, realistic, completely hilarious and exactly what movies are supposed to be.  In fact, Savages is everything right that Oliver Stone's U-Turn got very very wrong.

Savages is really entertaining.

Don't take it seriously. Don't expect a message or moral. Don't go in with expectations. Don't try to pick apart the story, performances or violence. You'll simply kill it in the process. Save a few victims, everybody in the film is having a heck of a lot of fun on screen and so did I watching it. Savages exists almost entirely to entertain and it succeeds admirably.

Everybody has it wrong, this isn't in 3D, it isn't a drug movie, chase movie or action movie.  Savages just gives you your money's worth.",1342483200,5,1057,4.801104972375691
4767974,1,B005LAII94,"There is not a bus large enough to throw this film under.  It qualifies as a Drive In second feature when the fourth film playing is the one you paid to see.

Dialogue is incredibly poor.  Written at a third grade level, this movie danced around the homosexual side story while continually pandering to the ongoing three person relationship.  While these two ideas are irrelavent to the main story, law breakers and their lifestyle, they become annoying through redundancy.

Benicio Del Toro, who is both capable and always worth watching, could not draw this bucket of trash movie back from the abyss.  Taylor Kitsch fans have another performance to enjoy but his character is not sympathetic. Selma Hayak, at the waning end of her sex appeal, fared no better with this script writers poor attempts at dialogue.

This should be the last time Oliver Stone is given money to put a film together.  His 28th attempt at entertaining us has fallen so far short of the mark as to aggrivate all viewers in the theater,

Seriously, save two of your life's valuable hours by refusing to waste them watching this.",1342483200,8,1103,4.7631578947368425
4767975,3,B005LAII94,"This movie was pretty disappointing. I give it two and a half stars. I want to like it, but it's just too hard. I was expecting Scarface, I wanted Scarface, but I got Alexander instead. The movie has a great premise, good actors, but it just comes out as a mess in the end. I must agree with other reviewers that the ending is just horrible. It stops this from being a good/okay movie, but even the first three quarters of the film are no where near great. It seems like it was all put together at the last minute. I'm hoping that all of this was just the common butchering of the movie studios and that there will be a director's cut or an intended original of the film sometime in the near future that gives me that deep feeling of ""Wow. What a profound piece of art I have just witnessed."" instead of ""Really? What the heck did I just watch for two hours?"" I hope I'm right. I know that Uma Thurman filmed scenes as Blake Lively's character's mom. These scenes were cut due to time constraints and could have possibly added some needed character development. Hopefully, that's evidence that there is a director's cut somewhere waiting to be shared. If not, they could give me a day or two in the editing room with this theatrical version and I could make a much better movie by moving certain scenes around and completely deleting others.
So that's my advice. Wait for a director's cut and skip the theatrical, you won't miss anything. It's all over the place. It starts off like a romantic drama between Blake Lively, Taylor Kitsch, and Aaron Johnson, then it progresses into a crime caper, takes a slight tangent into a family drama with Selma Hayek and her daughter, becomes a buddy comedy with John Travolta and Benicio Del Torro for a scene, back to crime caper to end it, re-end it with an arthouse twist, plus, unneeded narration here and there throughout the film.",1342137600,,1875,4.485380116959064
4767976,3,B005LAII94,"Great acting and very good script(except for the amateurish student film narration).
I just don't understand why Stone decided to do that with the ending...it honestly feels like you're watching a work in progress and not a finished film.

Worth a rental.",1341878400,,255,5.071428571428571
4767977,4,B005LAII94,"Oliver Stone returns to his most violent movie since ""Natural Born Killer,"" this time focusing on a couple marijuana entrepreneurs and their shared girlfriend.  Chon (Taylor Kitsch in his best movie role yet) is a former Navy SEAL who manages to bring back potent marijuana seeds from his tour in Afghanistan.  His lifelong friend Ben (Aaron Johnson) is hooked on Buddhism and doing charitable work in Africa.  His college degree is in business and botany.  How perfect.  Together they amicably share a love interest in Ophelia (another surprising performance from Blake Lively), who is known as ""O.""

As the story centerpiece ""O"" is the glue that holds things together.  She's also the chief weed sampler.  The story suggests that this relationship may be a bit more than two boys liking a girl but that question is never quite answered.  Hmm. All is well until they get an ""invitation"" to join a powerful Mexican cartel headed by Elena (Salma Hayek).  Saying no is not a good idea, as the guys are exposed to the grisly beheadings of cartel foes.  Elena and her California chieftain (an iniquitous Benicio Del Toro) need the secret to the THC-rich strain of pot so they kidnap poor ""O"" on the eve of trio's departure to a secret location in Indonesia.

Here is Elena's deal.  She gets 30% of the revenue, $13 million up front and they keep ""O"" under wraps for 1 year.  After that, the business venture ends.  Naturally Ben and Chon don't like the arrangement.  Especially Chon who realizes, the ruse will never end.  Added to the fun is John Travolta who plays a senior DEA agent.  He is on the take from Ben and Chon and may be playing all sides.  Stone gets strong performances from his cast in this savage thriller.  I can't help but wonder however why Stone decided to go with two endings.  The first one was fine.",1341705600,34,1820,4.660377358490566
4767978,5,B005LAII94,"""Savages"" is great! This is how the story goes: Laguna Beach entrepreneurs Ben, a peaceful and charitable Buddhist, and his closest friend Chon, a former Navy SEAL and ex-mercenary, run a lucrative, homegrown industry--raising some of the best marijuana ever developed. They also share a one-of-a-kind love with the extraordinary beauty Ophelia (O). Life is idyllic in their Southern California town...until the Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move in and demands that the trio partners with them. When the merciless head of the BC, Elena, and her brutal enforcer, Lado, underestimate the unbreakable bond among these three friends, Ben and Chon--with the reluctant, slippery assistance of a dirty DEA agent--wage a seemingly unwinnable war against the cartel. And so begins a series of increasingly vicious ploys and maneuvers in a high stakes, savage battle of wills.

The cast led by Taylor Kitsch (as Chon), Blake Lively (as O), Aaron Johnson (as Chon), John Travolta (as Dennis), Benicio Del Toro (as Lado) & Salma Hayek (as Elena) is great. The directing by Oliver Stone (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The screenplay (based on Don Winslow's novel) by Winslow, Stone & Shane Salerno (who also executive produced) is great.

The music by Adam Peters is great. The cinematography by Dan Mindel is great. The film editing by Joe Hutshing, Stuart Levy & Alex Marquez is great. The casting by Sarah Finn is great. The production design by Tomas Voth is great. The art direction by Lisa Vasconcellos is great. The set decoration by Nancy Nye is great. The costume design by Cindy Evans is great. The stunts coordinated by Keith Woulard is great. The visual effects supervised by Paul Graff is great. The special effects supervised by Mark R. Byers is great. The special make-up effects by Nick Marra is great. The set designs by Yvonne Garnier-Hackl & Thomas Machan, set dresses by John Bevan Jr., Sean D. Jackson, Thomas D. Krausz & Douglas McKay is great.

This is a great film that is well-made and entertaining. It is also well-acted, too. This is a great return for Oliver Stone. This is also a great summer film, one of the best films of the summer season. This is also a great film adaptation of a book to the big screen.",1341619200,10,2240,4.889473684210526
4767979,3,B005LAII94,"This isn't the first movie to come out this year to use this sort of narration, is it? Maybe ""Fallen"" is just coming to mind and that weak effort that left a sour taste in everyone's mouth reared its ugly head right from the start. But the familiarity slowly begins to wear off once O reveals her two lovers and what they do for a living. Speaking as someone who isn't really a fan of anything Oliver Stone has done, hopes weren't very high for ""Savages,"" but the trailers were at least intriguing. What you end up with is one of Stone's best efforts that is nearly tarnished thanks to a really feeble conclusion.

The cast for this is ridiculous. Out of the three movies Taylor Kitsch has done this year, this is easily the best. He seems more focused as Chon and the character is more brutal than John Carter or Lieutenant Alex Hopper. Aaron Johnson is a bit more laid back. His best scene is when Ben kills for the first time and he completely freaks out afterward. Blake Lively doesn't really do anything different compared to what she did in ""The Town"" other than bang two guys on screen.

Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta don't really step outside their boundaries either, but the characters they portray are ones they do so well that you won't really mind. Del Toro is just outstanding and both characters are entertaining in this sleazy kind of way. Salma Hayek is the one people are talking about the most though. It seems like there's already early Oscar buzz around her role. Elena is emotional, compelling, and intimidating; three things all great and memorable movie villains should be.

The soundtrack is literally all over the place, as well. It feels like it covers nearly every genre out there from 8-bit beats to industrial sounds, a full orchestra to dance music, hip hop tracks with Spanish vocals to piano, horns, and various different types of guitars. It's so different from everything else you've heard this year that it's difficult not to remember it.

""Savages"" is ridiculously good for about three-fourths of its duration; like borderline the top score of whatever you rate movies kind of good. The last twenty minutes or so completely ruins whatever it had going for it though. It's like ""Breaking Bad"" with pot instead of meth nearly the entire time. How do you screw that up? A really stupid ending practically destroys the whole deal.

It's like everything was progressing smoothly during the production process and then when it came down to the ending, Oliver Stone just ran in the room, pushed everyone behind him, and said, ""Step back, I'll take it from here, ladies and gents."" Then he proceeded to take this huge, drug-induced crap all over the finale and the smell nearly ruins the rest of the picture.

It is just massively frustrating. There's this brilliant cast, some pretty intense torture scenes, tons of blood, this fantastic soundtrack, explosive action, and even this amazing scene in a car between Aaron Johnson, Taylor Kitsch, and John Travolta that's reminiscent of that infamous car scene in ""Pulp Fiction"" where Vincent Vega's gun accidentally goes off. But then the ending comes along and once the credits roll, you're just left with the overpowering urge to kick a cluster of helpless, unsuspecting baby seals to the moon.",1341532800,3,3277,4.780918727915195

Does anybody kinow who (it was not the Dalai Lama!) said- ""if you are able to prevent a greater violence, act first and act fast""
Anyhow- my one gripe w Stone is that he does not make a movie about good people- like Catholic Worker soup kitchen.personnel who serve the poor- or peace activists like CODE PINK. The only good character in this movie was the horse. The 2 guys do not deserve an iidyllic ending in Bali- not after having torched a person to death w gasoline.

4770303,3,B005LAII94,"Savages is on the surface a full-out action thriller about a trio of Laguna Beach kids who have become very wealthy off hydro farming and their battle with the Baja cartel that wants in on their action. But, the thing about Savages is that that it may be about more than just a drug war thriller. It is about the age-old battle between civilized society and the savages and the thing is that savages don't play by civilized rules. They see you trying to be reasonable and compromise and see it as a sign of weakness that they are going to exploit. It plays out in the Yin and Yang that is Chon and Ben, one a pseudo-hippie that still wants to save the world in Darfur and the Congo and elsewhere, and the other battle-hardened by three tours of duty in Afghanistan against savages armed with IEDs and no lines that they wouldnt cross. It plays out in the battle between Chon and Ben and the insidious cartel that chops heads off merely to send a message. No quarter given.

It plays out against the sun-drenched backdrop of Laguna Beach with its basketball court and volleyball court right smack on the beach and O (Ophelia) who shops till she drops at the most fabulous malls in the country. Amidst all that sun and surf and innocence is a cutthroat battle, not just between the drug dealers and the cartels, but the predators who exist in real estate and business who simply are little more than savages in three-piece suits and who will give no quarter and exploit every weakness that they can see.

And how do we do battle with these savages and remain somewhat civilized without giving away the store? Do we end up becoming savages ourselves in the name of showing who can stand up taller? Can you really just close up shop and go to some island paradise without letting the whole world be overrun by savages? And how does one do battle with savagery when one has family and friends that can be threatened?

Having read Don Winslow's top-notch novel, the movie, despite the director and the star-studded cast simply doesn't have the same depth and feel to it.  Part of Winslow's literary genius is the deep background and history he gives to his characters.  That simply isn't there in the movie which focuses on the three-way love affair and the fancy cars without slowly bringing the movie watcher through the characters' stories and their subsequent loss of innocence.

Unfortunately, novels don't always translate well into movies and that proves to be the case here.",1438560000,,2476,4.615909090909091

A couple of Californian drug dealers and their shared girlfriend face a hostile takeover of their Laguna Beach drug business by a brutal Mexican cartel.

What did I think?

With an interesting-in-theory plotline and strong performances from supporting players, Savages could have been much better. Instead, the film suffered from shallow performances from the three leads, an over-reliance on cringe-worthy narration, and a serious lack of decisive direction to the point where two alternate endings were included (and neither of them was very good).

Only bother if you're in the mood to watch pretty people doing violent things.",1431820800,,647,5.376237623762377

4770719,5,B005LAII94,"What a great movie. Plus it was filmed in my neighborhood, what else can one ask for. Great movie stars, a lot of action & with some humor added in. Blu-ray and Unrated to boot, made for a fun time by everyone who watched it with me.
 I know that some of the reviews rate this thriller as awful. Really? What do these people expect from Oliver Stone. READ the name of this movie, it explains a lot of what goes on in the movie. Without going into full detail or an overview of what goes on in the movie, (read the rest of the reviews for the spoiler synopsis), it was entertainment. I realize that everyone will not get entertained with certain movies, so don't watch those type of movies and you will not be disappointed. If you like Oliver Stone and action, plus some humor with a first person narrative, drugs, you name it, this movie will entertain you for a couple of hours. See for yourself.

4770862,1,B005LAII94,"This movie is WAY overlong and tedious. It's like Oliver Stone came up with an interesting kidnap caper, then realized it only took all of 20-30 minutes to complete. So he added a love triangle that got him up to a couple hours. THEN he said, ""I'm Oliver Stone, if my movie's not at LEAST 3 hours long, it's nothing at all!"" So he added filler. Filler, filler, filler. He watched it, realized it sucks, and said, ""If two things can save a movie, they're graphic violence and sex!"" But, alas, no. Not even graphic nudity, violence, and sex could save this disaster. Horrid. 0.5 of 5 *s.

Oh, by the way, the entire driving force of this movie is acquiring different kinds of marijuana to traffick through southern California. But now that weed is legal there, the movie is almost comical to watch. It WOULD be comical, if it wasn't so bad.",1426464000,,838,4.477124183006536

4770911,3,B005LAII94,"The problem with Savages is that Scarface, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Blow and The Boondock Saints had already been released and forever ingrained into movie history.  Oliver Stone, that brilliant mind and visionary that brought us Platoon and JFK, The Doors and Natural Born Killers, brings us a tale far too late to be told.  If a pair of larger-than-life dope-growing pretty boys who share the same girlfriend or a cruel, remorseless female Mexican cartel honcho or burned-out, domesticated lackey FBI agent trip your trigger, by all means, jump right in.  The problem with Savages is it has all been done before.  Stone is, sadly,  even copying himself.  Gone are the days when gratuitous sex and violence and debauchery made us flinch.  You can thank Stone personally for that, along with De Palma, Tarantino, Scorsese and a host of others.  Savages takes us on a hackneyed journey with O (Blake Lively), the shared girlfriend of two bad boy (New Kids On The Block-ish) drug dealers Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who have reinvented the marijuana growing/slinging business, that is until a cartel gets wind of them and decides to make them unwilling partners no matter what.  They'll even kidnap O for good measure so the boys play nice.  Benicio Del Toro is the cartel baddie with Salma Hayek as his boss.  John Travolta is the FBI agent playing any side he can.  Yadda-yadda-yadda.  Don't get me wrong, Savages is entertaining to watch.  Its sick and twisted and ready to astonish, just so far from original that you may be insulted by its preposterous characters and plot.  A fine chorus of actors all playing caricatures of real people.  There is a farcical nature here, a homage to everything that has already been done again and again and again.  Is this something that we expected from Oliver Stone?  This movie is so banal, it could have been directed by anyone.  There is no Stone signature here at all.  Begs the question, has Oliver Stone given us all that he had to offer?  An amazing writer (Midnight Express, Scarface, Conan The Barbarian, even Evita) as well as director, Stone used to be heralded for his unflinching dedication to remain on the edge, controversial, fresh, innovative.  That Stone is apparently dead.  So sit back and watch Savages, a regurgitated hodgepodge of every crime movie ever made.  You'll be entertained, just not overly-impressed.

Yeah, the elite SEAL killer and the Peace Corps hippie, like these two polar opposites would ever be friends in real life (not buying it).  And of course the girl they both love and BOTH screw, ""O,"" the ditzy self-involved rich girl who literally does nothing except shop, get high and screw.  Jeez, can't imagine it took a lot of brain power to come up with ""O"".  Paris Hilton is way more original. And the story is even more unoriginal, the old gang battle over ""turf.""  Big gang says to little gang, WE run the show, YOU work for US now.  Little gang says no way, NOBODY pushes us around.  Big gang gets tough with little gang.  Little gang fights back and beats up big gang.  Yup, that's the whole not-so-thrilling story.

Hard to believe but this huge mess of a little movie was directed by the once mighty Oliver Stone who has fallen so far that he evidently can't get up.  Watching this movie you'd think it was directed by perennial big-budget hack Tony Scott (RIP).  It has all the Tony Scott earmarks--endless filtered lenses, soft focus, and so many super bright rainbow-y colors splashed across the screen you'd think they shot the entire movie through a spectrum color wheel.  Wow, how far poor Oliver Stone has fallen from his glory days of Platoon, JFK and Wall Street.  It's truly sad that he's ended up a Tony Scott-esque hack reduced to directing worthless drivel like this.  One would have expected so much more from an Oscar-winning director.",1423008000,2,1779,4.739413680781759

The film and book are related, but there are some big changes, and this is one time if you have invested your time in watching the film and looking through the book, that you ask yourself, ""Huh?"" at the film's conclusion.

I watched the first half and thought it was better than the book, but the second half went in a different direction and felt very strained. I knew what I was getting into when I chose to rent the film - an implausible plot, some two dimensional characters and beautiful scenery. But as it was finishing up, I felt letdown. I'm not bloodthirsty, don't like savage murders, but do think a cartel would function a bit differently than the one portrayed here.

So, would I recommend it to others? No, probably not. But if the trailer sets you up and you feel compelled to see how it all ended, then by all means rent the film and prepare to disbelieve some of what you see and hear.",1404518400,4,1032,4.287179487179487

4772036,2,B005LAII94,"i checked it out of the library to see if it was worth owning on blu-ray. I love Oliver Stone's films, because his stories are one of the things that inspire me to learn history.

I thought Stone would have done good in this one in explaining the world of the Mexican drug cartels, and he did a good job on that. He also did a good job in portraying Mexicans; as a Hispanic, i thought this movie really showed the raw reputation the Latino community has, because it is still the wild west when you live in a border city like San Diego or any other border city. Another good job he did is, besides Mexico being so close to the states, the people of Mexico live completely different lives than the average trashy american. I also like Del Toro's character; for a puerto rican he can play a mexican really good.

What i despised about this movie, which made me conclude that it is not worth watching again or even owning, is that it glorifies drug users in a way. C'mon, to portray ppl using a substance that only slows them down mentally in a glorifying manner is a major turn off for someone like me. I also got sick of the girl; she smokes weed, goes shopping, lives with two guys and screws them anytime, which practically makes her a prostitiute. In the movie she says they love each other........

I don't wanna go on, all i can say is that i expected better from Stone but i think he should apologize for going in this direction.  I didn't even read the book, and i dislike this movie.",1386806400,,1489,4.288256227758007

John Travolta and Salma Hayek are superb in supporting roles.  The look of the film is captivating with highly-pigmented hues and good editing.

4772143,1,B005LAII94,"Within the first five minutes, I wanted to turn this movie off--as soon as she said in the voice over, the eyeroll-worthy ""wargasms"", I had had enough.  I have very little patience for movies lately.
Even so, I forced myself to continue watching--it's Oliver Stone, right?
Oh, but it gets worse, because ""O"" then watches a video of decapitated heads and has no human reaction.  ""Oh, like people being tortured and beheaded, like. um, sigh and stuff""  And whilst the ""men"" then discuss this dangerous new development--another drug cartel wishing to take them over with threats of death included, the dingbat girlfriend joins the conversation and all but twirls her hair and bats her eyes and says, ""Let's, like, go party and stuff!""  I paraphrase, forgive me.

 Is she concerned with this seething, vicious threat to herself, her way of living, or to these two men that she supposedly loves SO much?  No!  Gee, I would be.  But, you know, that's just me.

They plan to leave the country, escape the cartel, and what does she do next?  She goes to the mall!!!!!  And the morons LET her!!  Because, you know, when attempting to double cross a clever drug cartel, I always plan on calmly, dreamily promenading through department stores, making innumerable purchases, and changing into new clothes--WHILE I'M SHOPPING.
IN THE REAL WORLD,  I'd be freaking out, terrified that something bad would happen, I'd leave immediately--Stone could have milked that part of the film, he could have really saturated it with such incredible suspense and genuine fear, it could have been so gripping.  But he destroyed it all. What a lost opportunity.

I guess I'm expecting more from people in their twenties, whether potheads or no, a serious situation is a serious situation, right?  These people act like thirteen year olds, like my nephew, just very unaware of consequences. It was infuriating to watch.

As for the rest of the movie, the twists and turns, the brutality, eh.  It was okay.  I think Salma Hayek was good in her role, but I don't like the relationship that was developed between her character and O, it, too, was off and contrived.  All of them seemed like cartoon characters, or caricatures, they should have been drawn with far more gravity, then the film would have been fascinating.",1385337600,4,2287,4.873056994818653

4772185,5,B005LAII94,"Duck the spoilers if you want . . .

Directed by Oliver Stone, with John Travolta in a very un-Travolta role, with more action, scary adventure, morality lessons, R-rated sex, a true rendition of the ups and eventual downs of 'benign' grass. With elegant to horrific production values, it's among the most entertaining and engrossing movie I've seen this year. Could be, ever. A real education, too.

SAVAGES' plot slams us from gritty to gorgeous, scary to sexy, beautiful to bloody.

Maybe spoilers: A trio of young, beautiful California types, two young men and a beautiful woman, all smart, materialistic,
charming and imaginative, discover a way to make and sell dynamite marijuana - cannabis, grass, MJ. Their lives are beautiful. They become millionaires. But when a Mexican drug cartel discovers these 'kids' are overwhelming competition, then come  blood reigns.

All out war begins between blood-thirsty drug lords and the beach
boys and girl California sellers. Okay, enough spoilers already.

To talk quality, the production is wonderful, sharp, extravagant, very California vistas, looks, action, color, talk.
I hone in on dialogue - the script never goes flat. The action is believably driven by sharp reparte`, vicious drug lord threats. Paradise is blown to hell. All, beautifully. Except for the gallons of blood, brains and bones shattered and splattered.

Not for family viewing. More for young adults with a strong message
that money isn't worth possible dangers, pain and inevitable losses.

I study movies, so I've seen SAVAGES three times, examining all elements, from words to pictures to the psychology of greed, the motivation of gimme-more mentalities. Overall, with extremes of bliss and vicious unexpected costs, SAVAGES is very-much a mind blower.  (And not, this isn't a cautionary tale. It's just intensely real)

Have you seen Johnny Depp's BLOW?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blow-HD/dp/B0091W9GQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blow [HD</a>] . . .

The Buddha versus evil duality represented by both characters was another cheap way of pushing the story through and through....

4772248,1,B005LAII94,"Murder, marijuana trafficking, bloody shootings, sadistic torture, point-blank executions, gratuitous graphic sex and enough sleaze to fill a pig trough are the hallmarks of Oliver Stone's ""Savages."" The last dud that Oliver Stone turned out was the sequel to ""Wall Street.""  Inert as that was, and it was almost embarrassingly bad, this go-round is truly awful, filled with gratuitous violence, torture, sex, a mediocre script and a ridiculous story line. This film reeks of sleaze and body odor.  Once upon a time there were a pair of sleazy, grungy, tattooed, sweaty, distinctly unappetizing guys (Taylor Kitsch (aptly named) as ""Chon,"" and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as ""Ben""), who lived in a gorgeous beach house in Southern California with their blonde paramour (""O"" played by Blake Lively), while cultivating marijuana in a gigantic state-of-the-art warehouse under optimal conditions, such that THEIR marijuana was thirty percent stronger than Mexican pot.  Yeah, right.  Along came a mean old Mexican drug cartel, with Benecio Del Toro as their vicious henchman, trying to co-opt them and muscle in on their business.  When they wouldn't capitulate, the meanies kidnapped their sweetie.  What follows is two hours of seedy violence, complete with Skyping back and forth between the ""good"" guys and the cartel, including scenes of brutal torture and endless grunge. It's about as lowlife as you can imagine, with a bad script, mediocre acting by the leads, and Salma Hayek as a nasty drug overlord bossing the Del Toro character around.  The plot is like Swiss cheese it has so many holes in it.  I wonder if Mr. Stone has children, and I wonder if he has ever given thought to the fact that producing violent garbage like this only contributes to more shootings and violence in the real world.  It's also very disturbing that Universal Studios would release a film that is so morally debased and reprehensible.  Equally surprising is the presence of John Travolta, who stumbles through his role as a government agent playing both sides of the street, and Benecio Del Toro, who can't possibly be so desperate that he would stoop to portraying this kind of garbage. After subjecting yourself to this movie, you feel an immediate urger to shower, so you can wash all the filth off.  God help the film industry.",1374883200,9,2310,5.068601583113456

4772465,3,B005LAII94,"If you never read the book, this movie might be alright.  Like maybe 3 stars.

If you DID read the book, you'll probably think even less of it.  And I know that's common.  Fans of books often hate adaptations.  But this one is especially egregious.

But I'm not reviewing this as an adaptation.  I'm just reviewing it as a film.  And as a film it's pretty dull, the acting is not good from the leads, it's ultimately forgettable, but it really LOOKS great and is filmed well.  So I guess that's something.

Oliver Stone used to be a great story teller.  Or maybe he just got lucky a few times.  Platoon is great.  JFK is entertaining--though insane.  I love Wall Street.  I even kind of like The Doors.  Most everything else ranges from ""awful"" (Alexander) to ""interesting mess"" (Wall Street 2, Natural Born Killers, W., Any Given Sunday, etc).  I think Savages falls in that second group.  But maybe I'm being kind.

First off, the casting is stupid.  The best performances come from Del Toro and Hayek--who only have supporting rolls.  The leads are awful.  Lively is like a wooden Paltrow.  I like Friday Night Lights, but unless Taylor Kitsch is talking about Texas football and drinking beer, he generally comes off about as convincing as a cigar store statue.  Aaron Taylor is just not good.

And then there's a tone.  ""Show, don't tell"" is what good story tellers are supposed to do.  Apparently Stone isn't interested in that.  So he gives us a narrator, a ton of exposition, and even a ""twist"" ending that's stupid.

Those willing to forgive Stone for the plot may think he's held to the source material.  But that's not really the case.  In the book, the storytelling is light and breezy.  Stone goes for heavy-handed and sentimental.  In the book, O. is a vapid material girl.  Here, she's just a whiny captive.  Chon is as 2 dimensional as characters get.  And Ben is some generic movie hippie from central casting.  Everything about this movie takes a book that is light and cool and fast-paced and turns it into some kind of melodrama with action...and if I wanted to see that, I'd plant myself on the couch and labor through Michael Mann's ""Heat"" for 7 hours...because at least it's entertaining.",1368230400,,2211,4.64935064935065

4772597,2,B005LAII94,"To give Oliver Stone credit, he has contributed some the most powerful films in cinematic history. But less can be said for his most recent film SAVAGES. I will admit that this isn't the worst film I've ever seen. Hell, it's not even the worst Oliver Stone film I've ever seen. That said, the film lacks a lot of what makes an Oliver Stone film compelling and what makes an audience stand up with full attention. Based on a novel, that I haven't read, it tells the story of two pot dealers Ben and Chon, who live the high life in Laguna Beach with their shared girlfriend O. Yes, her name is O just like the magazine. With their business taking off they soon catch some unwanted attention from a mexican cartel who ultimately take O hostage until they get a slice of the boy's profit. Now the performances are nothing to be sneezed at, because after all these are some fine actors. Salma Hayek gives a great and very humanistic portrayal of the cartel queen Elena and Benicio Del Toro is at the top of his game. I will even go as far as to praise John Travolta's performance as the crooked DEA agent. The actors are not the problem here, it's the story. The film drags where it shouldn't, the storyline drifts from one characters problems to the next without any real detail, and the ending is something that is less to be desired. In fact, for those who have seen the film and will know what I'm talking about, it should of ended with the three main characters lying in the desert. I know that sounds grim but for a film like this it would of worked.

Oliver Stone is a filmmaker who takes risks, and I admire that. But of course with risks comes consequences. And I think SAVAGES has suffered from that.",1365724800,,1705,4.378548895899054

As in an old George Roy Hill movie, they are living a carefree lifestyle, both sleeping with the same woman known as ""O"" (Blake Lively), until a Mexican drug cartel led by Elena (Salma Hayek) moves in. Things get out of control. Body count mounts.

""Savages"" is one of those films that could have been shorter and better. This is supposed to be a darkly entertaining crime drama, and what you need in making one is good storytelling and interesting characters. You don't need flashy camerawork. You don't need Blake Lively's bland voiceover that goes on and on. The character of ""O"" and her back story is the least interesting part of the film.

Chon and Ben are marginally better (at least they have something to do in the story), but the film is easily stolen by Benicio del Toro's bravura performance as the killer. John Travolta is a DEA agent Dennis. Emile Hirsch is a computer hacker. Both actors (especially Hirsch) are so underused.

I simply don't know why Oliver Stone wanted to make this movie, which is neither thrilling nor funny enough.

4772648,5,B005LAII94,"This is certainly one of Stones best movies in a long time, a very cool story based on a novel by the same name, this feels very much like a Tarantino style movie the way it plays out with great fun and interesting characters that get themselves into some sticky situations as they mingle with the wrong people, the movie centres around the three main characters Chon and Ben and their girl O whom they share, they grow and sell the best weed in town and get mixed up with a rival Mexican drug cartel who kidnaps O and then everything goes wrong as the two boys turn to violence to get her back, it's a well paced movie that keeps you going with strong performances from a quality cast Salma Hayek, John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro are all great supporting cast, this is well worth checking out, the extended bluray cut is around 10 minutes longer making it around a 2hr 20min film.",1364169600,,884,4.363636363636363

4772663,4,B005LAII94,"Product arrived in good condition and the movie is an overall enjoyment - for adults viewing.  It's a story of young ""entrepreneurs"" in the drug trade, a look into the partner sharing of a single woman and finding a formula refining the purity of a 'drug' is a target of other dealers (ie: doesn't this resemble the business enterprise world..?).
The success of this movie is due to the strong supporting cast of John Travolta, Salma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro.  These 3 veteran actors played their roles well.  The location settings are terrific, including the lab.
The sexual scenes after 10 minutes into the movie is, in my opinion, unnecessary.  It could have been done in other methods to illustrate the woman-sharing partnership of the 2 leading male characters.  The female character holds no value in the movie although it is used as the primary reason for the turmoil and violence in the movie.  It would have been a better script - for example, no girl but 3 best buddies - Dennis (Travolta), Chon (Kitch) and Ben (Taylor) looking out for each other.
As for the 2 lead characters played by Kitch and Taylor, they did not give me a true-buddy feeling.  I guess they can learn a lot from the 3 professional actors supporting them.
The graphic-brutality of the drug-dealers may hold some truth in it but it seems decapitation is such a commonly use effect to extort and exert force.  I think the real drug lords should think of a better and creative way of enticing dedicated followers - instead of cutting them to pieces.
Overall, its because of Travolta, Hayek and Del Toro + the scenic environment that gives it a 4.",1363996800,,1626,4.660839160839161

4772732,3,B005LAII94,"SAVAGES was an okay surprise. How close to the truth this is I don't know. The two Californian dudes growing the best quality grass seem like real surfer dudes from the beaches of California. One of the dudes has come back from the war in Afhganistan and the other is a trained botanist. The soldier dude is the enforcer, where the other takes care of buisness. Both dudes share the same woman and when the Mexican drug cartels move in to take over their business the girl is kidnapped and the two are forced to work for the Cartel

The best performances come out of Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta. Both actors light up the movie once they're on screen. Oliver Stone stages a brilliant action set-piece 65 minutes into the movie. The movie is extremely violent and one has to see the extended cut. How truthful the ending is I don't know?

Characters are a bit thinly developed, but not much time for that...and they are not very likeable. John Travolta is good as a FBI agent and keeps it real while having a real dramatic scene, Salma Hayek plays a drug lord and I think takes her big ""dramatic"" scene a bit too ""over the top"". Benicio Torres(?) is a scary dude... looks it and acts it... lots of blood and some pretty bizarre stuff... Oliver Stone in my opinion has a ""close, but no cigar"" film here.

4772738,3,B005LAII94,"Checked it out from the library and have tried to watch it twice all the way through, but could not stomach it.  The torture scenes are highly distressing, so I've decided to skip through them on my next attempt to view the movie - they seem very realistic to me.  Didn't understand the relationship between the leads, understood that they liked each other, but not why, didn't get enough information about them; they are all beautiful, but didn't understand them.  The drug business was presented in a terrifying way, and I didn't understand why the leads were in it; apparently they had been discussing quitting before the hostile takeover attempt by the more violent competitor, the story shows the two owners disagreeing about the timing to quit the business, but the kidnap of O happened all too quickly for them to get out at their own pace.  Money seemed to be the reason everyone was involved in the business, from the leads, to their competitors, to the crooked DEA agent - no one seemed that concerned about breaking the law, which I guess makes sense if a character is in the business.  Drug films distress me because they seem to concentrate the ugliest aspects of human nature into a 90 minute production, which is hard to take, so I think I'm already biased against them, which is why I gave the film an extra half star, to counter-weigh my bias.  The actors were good, the competitors were frighteningly violent, and the leads, in kidnapping the competitors child, showed that they have similar business tactics as their competitor when push comes to shove.  I did not know why I should sympathize with the leads, they are criminals knowingly working in a violent, illegal business; instead of getting out when they were pressured by their competitors, they dug in their heels - I don't care why they dug in their heels, they were stupid to remain in such a high risk, violent, illegal, venture.  Hard to sympathize with stupidity.  I found it believable that the competitor, a woman, had her business stolen from her by her lieutenants.  Story doesn't really give new information about the drug business, just another take on it from the point of view of the sex/love interest of one of the players.  I'll attempt to watch it again, but as I couldn't understand the leads' relationship, and I find the violent drug business terrifying, I think this is just not a story to my taste. 2 and a half stars for eye candy provided by the leads, their locales, and for the filmmakers efforts.",1362787200,,2500,4.7110091743119265

4772839,2,B005LAII94,"If I had to guess, I would say that the director of this film is some young hotshot on the Hollywood scene. Hollywood probably has a lot of aspiration for him, and foresees even bigger, glitzier films. Whoever made this shows a lot of potential and you can just tell he wants to get at the meat of gritty reality. Unfortunately there is a lot of pomp and glam covering the entire picture that is, simply put, lame and often leads to inconsistent characters - case in point is Salma Hayek's.

My suggestion to this Hollywood hotshot is spend about one year studying 'No Country For Old Men' - read the novel (as well as other Cormac McCarthy novels) and dig into the sophistication and gravity of the Coen's film version. 'No Country For Old Men' is a masterpiece in film and focus on that.",1362096000,,789,4.441379310344828
4772880,4,B005LAII94,"I wasn't exactly in the mood to watch a two hour movie about another story revolving around weed dealing and the drug cartel.  I had low expectations when I started watching this, but by the end of the film I was blown away.  The only reason I knocked a star off this is the last ten minutes ruined the ride.  I hate it when filmmakers compromise and do something unrealistic and silly to close up a movie.  The rest of the movie was fantastic.  Blake Lively is the girlfriend or play thing for two men played by Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson.  The two men are peaceful pot dealers of the some of the greatest pot.  Of course there little love triangle might be seen as odd.  Three people in a relationship together just doesn't work and isn't real.  It also plays that way.  The girl feels adored by the showering attention from the men.  And the men are more into each other sharing everything including the girl.  That is until the Mexican cartel wants a piece of their weed business.  The two men turn the deal down and the top dog drug lord is furious and has their sex pot girl abducted.  I'm not giving away the story because this is what sets the story off into a roller coaster ride of adrenaline.

Everyone is surprised to find the top drug lord is a woman played by Salma Hayek.  She is the highlight of this movie.  It's always great to have an incredible actor playing a tough villain and she does with great veracity.  She doesn't do it alone, she's got her own sleazy hitman played also beautifully by Benicio Del Toro.  They are both so good they overshadow the performances by the American leads with the exception of Blake Lively who takes her sex pot act and ramps it up to something more interesting as the movie progresses.  The hype surrounding this movie was the fixation on the three way love affair.  That's minuscule compared to what really goes on in the movie.  I walked in expecting a super bad movie and I walked out thoroughly entertained....that is until the last ten minutes when its wrapped up in a lame way.  You wouldn't expect that from an experienced Director like Oliver Stone, but I'll over look it and keep how the movie should have ended fresh in my mind.

Their dualist moralities are a metaphor for the spirituality seeking/relief from emotional anguish duality that drives the consumption of mind altering substances in this country (the US).  The narrator is their lover, a very appealing, educated, and lost young woman. The cast and acting are excellent, the sex, the best I have seen in awhile, the politics- right on.

4773287,3,B005LAII94,"Now, there's two ways to look at violence in movies. You can wave it off and pretend it doesn't influence anything or you can say that it surely plays a role in today's craziness in our society.  There are so many troubled people out there, how can you really make yourself believe that the violence you see in Hollywood doesn't contribute to put crazy ideas in their heads? Especially when the characters using that violence are so jaded about it? It has to have at least a minimum impact. This Oliver Stone movie, this ""Savages"" , is well done, with great actors, great cinematography, great editing and music. The rhythm is hypnotizing and you really want to know how the heck it's going to end. But I had trouble with the violence. And the way it was portrayed. Maybe I'm getting old. I still love action, though. But when you see all the real shootings happening out there and all the sadness caused by the real weapons and the psychos using them, it sure makes you wonder about the righteousness of Oliver Stone's goal here.  Do we really need to be reminded how savage we can be? Right now? In 2013? A lot of people are complaining (rightly so, I think) about the role of Hollywood in today's culture of weapons. I know we can't simply stop doing action movies but c'mon...  this is Hollywood's response? Anyways, it's still a great film, in terms of structure and suspense.  If you don't mind the violence, the guns and torture. After all, it's just a movie, huh?",1359244800,,1471,4.539622641509434

4773560,2,B005LAII94,"The acting was good around even the woman who's name escapes me and I don't really care enough to look it up, was pretty good. But the problem with the story is that it expected me to care about these drug dealer's plight and being endangered. I wasn't. Not in the least. I stayed with the movie because I am huge fan of Benicio Del Toro and to a much lesser extent, John Travolta who in my biased opinion those two stole the movie and were the only true highlights of this rather weak ""drug"" movie.

Benicio Del Toro shines as the selfish, conniving main muscle for drug lord, Selma Hayek. He is a bit awkward but truly heartless and somebody that you can safely call a surviving rat in every sense of the word, A real creep of a guy that you really can't help enjoy Del Toro do what he does best. If he wasn't in this movie, I can't imagine myself finishing the movie. His scenes are the ones that contain the more graphic, bloody scenes.

I honestly didn't care if these drug dealers got caught, swindled their way out of handcuffs, shot, strangled, stabbed or were blown up in a boat, car or restaurant. I wasn't emotionally involved and the movie did not provide anything new or informative where it could at least keep me interested on that level at least. There is very little action, very little drama, and yes the token black friend is the first to die...lol, and it is not even a horror movie!

If you are into the drug culture perhaps this movie would be a good way to waste time but for me this movie bored me to the point where it took me two sittings to finish a movie...that doesn't happen often. Two early sex scenes that show completely nude male buttocks but the woman is somehow covered in the right areas...should have been enough of a warning to know that this movie was going to suck.

This trio is appealing in their dilemma but Benicio Del Toro, as Lado, steals the show as the cartel enforcer.  John Travolta is great as a corrupt DEA agent playing both sides.

4774522,2,B005LAII94,"When I first saw Savages pop up on the radar, I was stoked.  A story about two guys going up against the Mexican cartel, directed by Oliver Stone?  Sounds awesome.  Once I saw that Emile Hirsch was cast, I was all in (for some reason, I'll see anything the guy is in).  Well...did it live up to the hype?

Savages is one of the most poorly written screenplays I have ever had the pleasure of watching unfold on screen.  The dialogue is laughable, and none of the characters have any traits that an audience member would want to latch on to.  One of the bits of dialogue, right in the first five minutes of the film, says something to the effect of ""I have orgasms, he has wargasms.""  Sounds like something that a tenth grader would write in the first draft of a dramatic short story.  The acting is just about the same caliber.

There's one action scene that was well done, but it was short and, well...too little, too late.  This train wreck doesn't even end in a satisfying way.

Avoid this mess.  What was Oliver Stone thinking?",1356652800,,1031,4.391534391534392

The actor who plays Chon looks like he is on release from a soap opera contract and John Travolta just makes everyone feel uncomfortable. Blake Lively is so vacant that her doe eyed stares only carry her poor acting ability for the first five minutes of the film.

Now this trio all live together and all love one another. (Though I'm going to say that with Ben and Chon, it's probably one of those protracted 'bromances'.)

I feel like they've known each other since like FOREVER--like maybe at least since high school. (In my mind, I'm sensing that Ben was more of the academic and Chon was maybe more of the jock and that one way or another, the two of them were able to forge a more or less symbiotic bond.)

Though I guess time and space have a way of changing things. Because enter their world O--short for Ophelia (from Shakespeare).

She develops a friendship with the two of them and eventually starts working in their grow-op.

One thing leads to another, and boom, she's living and loving the two of them. (We the audience, don't get to see any of this, because by the time the story begins, the three of them are already together.) Like most stories, this part of the story is NEVER dealt with and I just think it would've been an interesting one to explore.

Only that's not really what this story is about.

What this story IS about, is how these three young people have a very successful grow-op business making some of the best marijuana on the planet. They are so successful that a certain cartel is VERY interested in joining them.

Now of course none of them want this. They would only want to continue on with their happy existence. You know, the one where they get to live in their tricked out little love shack on the beach (that's HARDLY a shack!) and live all happily ever after.

They would want this most definitely, only the cartel has other plans.

This is where the story really starts to develop and so I won't say much more.

What I WILL say is that the casting for this film was most inspired. LOVED the main three actors who portrayed Ben: Aaron Johnson, O: Blake Lively and Chon: Taylor Kitsch.

They all seem like people who could really know and care about each other.

John Travolta as the crooked DEA agent was refreshing--so used to him being just the good guy all the way. (And maybe through all of it, he DOES turn out to be good after all?)

Salma Hayek as the head of the cartel was tough and quite believable in her role.

And Benicio Del Toro was fierce.

Thank you again Mr. Stone, for making probably my one of my favorite movies and CERTAINLY my favorite movie of 2012.

In addition, they are friends from High School. Ben, played by Aaron Johnston, is a Buddhist, incredibly giving, and the more gentle of the best friends. Chon, played by Taylor Kitsch, is the more outspoken and hard-nosed of the two, amplified by his background in the war as a Navy Seal.  Both best friends/dealers share one girlfriend, O (Blake Lively), who ends up playing a pivotal role in the plot. O, in addition, serves as the narrator throughout the 130 minute film.

Things grow awry for the Laguna Beach boys when the Mexican drug cartel wants to be a part of  their lucrative business. The cartel assert their corrupt power and authority by holding O hostage until Ben and Chon meet their demands. O is the most important facet of either of Ben or Chon's life, so they know they must devise means to save their beloved. Using both Elena (Salma Hayek), the top of the cartel, and her no. 2 Lado's (Benicio Del Toro) thinking against them with the help of a corrupt DEA Agent (John Travolta), Ben and Chon end up rescuing their mutual gal-pal.

The film was one I highly anticipated seeing, but failed to grace my hometown.  After viewing, it was not a film I would envision Oliver Stone directing, but I was pleasantly surprised as the film was better than I expected it to be.  The film is 'savage' itself in many ways, give prominence of sexual situations, substance use, and violence/gore. Perhaps it is the plot and some of the plot's savagery that leaves some room for criticism, particularly given some of the mixed reviews on amazon.com in particular.

Along the way you are treated to such brilliant dialogue as that quoted in the title of my review, and endless, endless scenes of bong smoking and unbelievably embarrassing shots of POOR PEOPLE WITH CANCER LINING UP TO THEIR MARY JANE (just in case you dared think for a second that marijuana shouldn't be legalized) and, even more outrageously embarrassing, scenes of one of the dealers setting up SCHOOLS AND CHARITIES FOR POOR BLACKS - all with money made by selling drugs!

4776719,3,B005LAII94,"I began watching ""Savages"" predisposed to like it because I got a kick out of the book.
  After seeing it, though, I'm not sure what I think.
  On one hand, it's very ""Scarface.""  And I don't mean that as a compliment.  Words and phrases like ""imitative"" and ""done before"" come to mind.  And the violence couldn't be more heavy-handed.  ""Over-kill"" if you will.
  On the other hand, though, that was what the book was about.  And, up to a point, Oliver Stone was faithful to it.
  And yet... I don't know.  The movie left a bad taste in my mouth somehow.  If someone thought this film was lurid, exploitative crap, I'd get their point.
  But, I have to admit, I found it riveting and compelling.  Even though just about every character in it was despicable or, at least, morally... um, challenged, and I wasn't able to root for any of them.
  Worth seeing, however, are Travolta and  del Toro.  And not, really, for the good acting they do.  Travolta must have been paid extra to appear in the film as he did:  overweight and balding.  And del Toro?  Chubby, bloated and, very oddly, looking  much like Brad Pitt with eight hours of make-up.
  I will mention one group, however, that I'm sure loved ""Savages.""  And that would be the Coastal Orange County Chamber of Commerce (if there is such a thing).  Laguna Beach looked like paradise, and even the nearby shopping malls looked liked great places to go.  So, kudos to the cinematographer.  Because I used to live there, and none of that was ever as appealing in reality as it looked in ""Savages.""

Definitely not the case.  I rank this in the top 10 of the most horrible over-hyped movies.  I wish I could get back the 2+ hours of my life that I wasted on this movie.",1353974400,,397,3.9125
4776916,3,B005LAII94,"I bought this one on itunes and I have to say, I kind of regret it.  Blake Lively is just not that good of an actress.  She did good in ""The Town"" but other than that I haven't liked ANY of her other roles including this one.  She still seems stuck in this teenage phase which is weird.

The main problem I had with this movie is that it was trying so hard to be deep but in the end there was nothing.  It was pretty much a superficial movie.  That would have been fine, had there been a lot of action and more shoot out scenes.  Instead we got a slow thriller with some pretty uninspired plot twists.  From the trailers you get the impression that these two guys are going to take on the cartel and get their shared hoe back.  That is not what happens.  They tip toe around the confrontation and try to get Salma Hayek's cartel to destroy itself.

I guess the movie was trying to say something with the whole love story between the 3 main characters but all I saw was two dudes that loved each other so much that they had sex with each other through this girl.  The girl had some daddy/men issues and these guys where there for her.  They were using her to channel their suppressed homosexual feelings for each other and she was using them as father figures.  That's as deep as that relationship goes.  It was stupid and honestly this seemed to play out more like a slutty teenage girls college fantasy. I just don't see this as realistic at all.

At one point in the movie one of the cartel assassins notices that they both sleep with the chick and calls them savages.  I guess this was supposed to be a comment on how some people see savagery in sexuality more than they do in violence.

Out of everyone I enjoyed Salma Hayek's performance the most.  She stole every scene she was in.  That was the biggest highlight of the movie.

In the end I'm glad I watched it, I just wish I had rented it instead of buying it.  That's what happens when you take a risk and just buy on impulse.",1353974400,,1985,4.209549071618037

Trying to compete with anyone of those great films (OK swordfish was not great) is a giant risk, but trying to be all of them is, well, not really doable.  Now the movie itself.  cliche, predictable and unauthentic.  The film puts too much weight on the characters and they all become larger than life, with a modern cutesiness that makes you cringe.  The idea that these heartless murderers are quirky and likeable just like me and you is deeply flawed and it doesn't work on screen.  Finally the narration by the girl throughout starts off well, but as you get to know her character on screen, her narrative doesn't match her personality at all.  It becomes annoying to hear her voice after a while.

4777271,3,B005LAII94,"This Oliver Stone's latest directorial effort is a drug cartel/caper fantasy headlined by 3 attractive young stars and other veteran seasoned actors.  The film is based on a book which seems to have lifted the premises of Francois Truffaut's 'Jules & Jim' but transported the trio to the colorful Southern California drug world.  Stone and 2 other writer cooked up this rambling script (overlong at 2 hr 11 mins .  90 mins maybe more desirable but the film makers will not have so many things throw at you) seemingly had a good time and possibly under the influence as well while writing and directing the film(watch out for the shot of Stone dancing in the clouds with Lively).  Unfortunately this viewer did not share their enthusiasm.  The main problems are the weak and unfocused story/screenplay, superficial characterizations and some bad casting(Selma Hayek) and unusual but unsatisfactory ending.  Of the 3 main characters, Taylor Kitsch was supposed to be the veteran war killing machine but with the exception of his first sex scene, his rage seemed to disappear altogether right afterwards.  Blake Lively worked hard and might be the only female actor who kept her top on during violent sex.  Only Aaron Johnson managed to give a sensitive and intense performance throughout.  I believe it was his acting chops, rather than the script or direction. Credits must be given to John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro for giving us a couple of brilliant scenes together.

Oliver Stone has brought some brilliant films to the screen - Platoon, Wall Street, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Born on the Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, W., Heaven and Earth, World Trade Center, etc - and it is with the expectation that his current film will live up to those standards that most viewers commit to the 147 minutes of SAVAGES. The film is long on gore and drugs, delivers some rather caricatures of ideas (Benicio Del Toro, Selma Hayak, John Travolta) and waste a lot of time on inconsequential things.  But the story itself has some merit, though it has been done many times before: the drug market can turn people into savages.

Entrepreneurs Ben (Aaron Johnson), a peaceful and charitable marijuana producer, and friend Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a macho, hunky, rough former Navy SEAL, run a lucrative, homegrown industry - raising some of the best weed ever developed. They also share a one-of-a-kind love with Ophelia (Blake Lively) in a three-way romance. Life is an idyllic triad in their Southern California town of Laguna Beach ... until the Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move in and demands that the trio partners with them. When the merciless head of the BC, Elena (Salma Hayek) and her enforcer, Lado (Benicio Del Toro), underestimate the unbreakable bond of the three friends, Ben and Chon - with the reluctant assistance of a dirty DEA agent (John Travolta) in cahoots with El Azul (Joaqu&iacute;n Cosio) - wage a seemingly unwinnable war against the cartel. And so begins a series of increasingly vicious ploys and maneuvers in a high stakes, savage battle of wills involving the kidnapping of Ophelia as well as the kidnapping of Elena's daughter. Throw in cameos by Emile Hirsch, Demi&aacute;n Bichir, and what seems to be a cast of thousands, top it off by a cutesy ending suggested by the opening lines of the film, and try to get past the boring voice over storytelling by Blake lively and settle in to the gore of beheadings, and other gruesome events and you have Oliver Stone's latest. The film as its moments but it goes on far too long and doesn't have the class of the original novel by Don Winslow (who surprisingly shows up as a screenwriter!).

4777728,1,B005LAII94,"There is nothing about this movie I can recommend. The plot is never believable at any point. The characters are cliche with no depth. The production values are good, but it's all for nothing.
It starts with a voice over where ""O"" tells you what kind of movie it is. She explains your assumptions are wrong. She's right in my case. I assumed Oliver Stone could still make a decent movie.
Characters are introduced. It's all very dramatic and silly. ""O"" is a rich girl with daddy issues. You also have your war scarred soldier, hippy world savior, ruthless cartel strong man, corrupt law officer, hacker, etc.
The hippy grows the best weed in the world! He wants more from life, though. He and the soldier love each other and run a successful marijuana cultivation company. They both love O. They are all so happy in their love triangle, but the cartel wants in on their business. Bro-mance don't want to deal and O pays the price.
Bro-mance is willing to do anything to rescue O. They love her SO MUCH! This is possibly the most absurd part. This amazing woman spends her days getting high, shopping, and having sex with Bro-mance. The only back story you get is that her father is absent, her mother is often away, she's rich, and has been using drugs since she was 14. She's a spoiled drug addict with daddy issues who has never done anything with her life because she didn't have to. What a rare find in California! She gets kidnapped because she has to go to the mall one more time before they all flee the ruthless cartel. Seriously. The cartel's strong man, who has been watching the threesome, isn't sure if Bro-mance loves her or if she is just a prostitute. You wouldn't know either if O didn't tell you. Apparently love is getting high and having sex. He calls his boss hundreds of miles away and says as much. She immediately knows this is just the leverage the cartel needs. How? She just does, okay?
Lots of people die in horrible ways and the story progresses to the worst ending I've ever seen. You might find it poignant if you're a teenager, but most people will just laugh. I was laughing while O explained that's not what happened. What really happened is only the second worst movie ending I've ever seen.",1353283200,36,2225,4.523573200992556

Violent, disturbing, gripping, ""Savages"" focuses on a savage woman as leader and destroyer, and her victim as a woman who might just double for anything.

The two male leads are, in the film, gay, and this put many viewers off, as their homophobia ran through them with the added help, no doubt, of the presence of John Travolta, once loved, and now hated for being gay.

Benicio Del Toro's performance was excellent.  In fact without him, Salma Hayek, John Travolta the movie would have been a total waste of time.

Regardless of what happened to ""O""  how did that airhead become a ruthless killer when Ben tossed his cookies when they robbed the cartel?

First the book. The first Winslow book I read was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-of-the-Dog/dp/1400096936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power of the Dog</a>, which I thought was simply terrific. Based on that book, I've read several of his other works, and in my opinion he hasn't matched the level of that achievement in anything else of his that I've read.

A bit too much of the Winslow-patented surfer vibe, and the over-the-hill ""dude"" stuff for my taste. But when I read that it was being made into a movie, I thought it had some good potential, with the visuals and twisted plot and all.

Enter Oliver Stone, a guy with about the most uneven record in Hollywood. When he's hitting his marks, he can make a pretty good flick; ""Platoon"", ""Wall Street"". When he's off, his stuff is ridiculous; ""JFK"" and ""W."" come immediately to mind.

And unfortunately, this is a complete misfire.

Stone seems to have taken every opportunity to explore the weaker elements of the book while completely ignoring or perverting its strengths. Some of the performances are completely over the top. I don't know if he was trying for some kind of sarcastic humor approach, or failed satire, or what.

Then, to add insult to injury (and why I detracted one star), he gave us the ending that was in the novel.... and then ""Oooops! Only kidding!!""... he throws in a SECOND ending, too, that made absolutely no sense at all, and destroyed what little he'd managed to achieve to that point!

I mean, what the hell was that all about???

I'd have thrown something hard at the screen, but I was watching it on my own plasma big sreen, so that would have been a bit of an overindulgence.

4777845,3,B005LAII94,"I will say upfront that I have not read the book that this movie is based on. In fact, I only learned it was based on a book after I watched it. So my review is just about the movie. The movie was entertaining, and I enjoyed watching it, until the ending (I will get to that later, and I will give a SPOILER ALERT before I give anything away). I just am a little bit mystified about what this movie was trying to be. I should also mention that I am a philosophy student, and I tend to interpret everything from that standpoint. I am always looking for the philosophy in everything. If you are uninterested in that kind of thing, I would recommend skipping my review. If you are interested in that kind of thing, well then, buckle up, because you are in for the ride of your life! (did I oversell it?)

Other people have already described the plot, so I am just going to jump right into the thematic material. This movie seems to me to have a lot of material for a good movie, I am just not sure it makes that material into anything. There is the title for example. ""Savages"". The movie revolves around a conflict between relatively peace loving pot growers from California, and a violent Mexican drug cartel, and at various points in the movie each side refers to the other as ""savages"". Clearly the filmmakers are attempting to make a point here, I am just not sure what it is. That we are all savages at heart? That terms like ""civilized"", ""cultured"", and ""savage"" are relative? These are interesting ideas, and the exploration of those questions would make for a good movie, but as far as I can tell, this movie does not even attempt to explore those questions in any meaningful way. Which does not make it a bad movie, it just leaves me a bit perplexed.

The tale is pretty straight forward. The pot growers are relatively decent human beings, and the Mexican cartel comes in and threatens to torture and kill someone they love, and so they retaliate. In other words, a plot you have seen many times before, which does not make it bad, I tend to enjoy good formulaic plots, but I feel like the title of the movie, and the throw away comments about ""savages"", sets up a kind of expectation that never really gets fulfilled. There is the expectation that something is going to be said on the theme of ""savagery"", and I just do not think that the film delivers. It would be like an announcement in the paper ""Lecture on Savages"" by Oliver Stone, Wednesday 7pm-8pm. Then you get there and he does not show up.

The closest the film gets to saying anything explicit about ""savagery"" is at the end of the movie, during the last voiceover, where O. literally reads the dictionary definition of ""savage"". Um, really? That is where the movie went for its profound insight into savagery? Webster's? Like I said, none of this makes this a bad movie. It is not necessary for movies to provide deep insights into concepts like ""savagery"" to be good, but if you are hoping for some insight into the concept of ""savagery"" that you could not get from breaking out the dictionary, I think you will be disappointed with this movie.

I think the best scene in the movie is the dinner with Elena (Selma Hayek) and O. (Blake Lively). That seems to me to be one scene where people claim to see some moral complexity in the film, because we get a little peek into the motivations behind Elena's assumption of the throne, and something rare happens: we feel sorry for the head of a drug cartel, even when she seems to be entirely in control, and at the height of her power. That is not entirely true since she is being driven out of Mexico by rival cartels, but we do get a peek into the violence and death that come along with her particular job. It is not an enviable life, and it is a mystery to me why any human being on earth would ever have ambition to become the head of a drug cartel. This, I think, is one of the achievements of the film. I cannot think of any other movie that portrays the head of a drug cartel in that way. Usually those kinds of villains are just caricatures. On the one hand, they represent our own desires for wealth, power, women, or to be free from moral constraints, etc., and on the other, they are empty place holders for all of our hate and fear, so that at the end of the movie, when they get their comeuppance, we all leave the theater feeling like we have experienced some kind of catharsis. All the terror we feel in our everyday lives has been turned back on the people who are responsible for that terror. And it feels good, for a little while anyways. That is the role that heads of drug cartels usually play in movies. This movie deserves credit for ""complexifying"" the picture a bit (that's right, I just made up a word, I warned you things might get crazy).

One of the achievements of this movie is that it actually makes the audience sympathetic with the vicious head of a drug cartel who is holding an innocent woman captive. The problem is, again, I am not really sure what the point is. What is the film trying to say? That the heads of drug cartels are really sad, lonely, and misunderstood? I also do not think that this is really ""moral complexity"". It is ""character complexity"". The makers of the film created an interesting character, and they deserve credit, but there is no moral complexity there. Her actions are heinous. We do not leave the cinema with any deep questions about what is right or wrong.

The same can be said in relation to the pot growers. Their dilemma does not really raise any deep moral questions. They are just in a bad situation, but that is what movies do. They put people in bad situations. My review is sort of  turning into a response to some other reviews I read, which is not what I intended. I just do not agree with the claim that this movie explores ""moral complexity"" any more deeply than any other movie that puts characters in situations where they have to make difficult decisions. Movies set these kinds of dilemmas up all the time, not because they are exploring moral themes, but because it creates tension. Is the good character going to let the person they love die, or are they going to commit a morally reprehensible act and lose their soul? So I do not think this movie is really saying anything very interesting about morality either.

The last theme I will mention is the theme of our modern pot culture. It seems to me that Oliver Stone is taking some shots at that California culture (and I live in California by the way), particularly in the dinner scene, where O. is explaining her decision to leave community college to the person who is holding her captive and threatening to cut off her head if her ""boyfriends"" do not do as she says. That was, as I said before, a good scene. But I have to ask again, what is the point? What is Oliver Stone saying about our culture? It is possible that he is saying that it has a dark side that people do not pay attention to. That is an interesting idea! And it is the one idea that I think the film really does develop to some degree. There is, on the one hand, the sunny California beaches, and the friendly neighborhood pot stores, and then, there are the dark cells where people have their heads cut off by chain saws. People certainly have a tendency to ignore the dark side of things. Actually, what I should say is, people fail to see that the light and dark sides are often two sides of the same coin. You cannot have one without the other (in some cases, at least). In the case that this movie explores, you cannot have the the pot filled California lifestyle without the dark cells and decapitated bodies. Of course, one could certainly argue that the two sides only go together because marijuana is still illegal, and who knows, perhaps Oliver Stone meant the movie to be a giant ""legalize marijuana"" commercial.

It is possible that I am searching too hard for this movie's ""message"" since it is, after all, an Oliver Stone picture, and we expect a message when Oliver Stone is involved. I read conflicting reviews of this movie. Some reviewers claimed that it was refreshing to see an Oliver Stone picture without a message, that was just good, not-so-wholesome entertainment. Other reviewers claimed that this movie represents Oliver Stone's triumphant return to the soap box. I am not sure it is a good thing that people are having such conflicting responses. I tend to think the movie is probably trying to say something, I just am not really sure what that is.

From what I have said so far, it probably sounds like I really hated the movie, but I actually found it to be compulsively watchable. It works as an ""action"" movie, with interesting characters, and an interesting plot. I am just not sure that people should be trying to make more out of it than that. There were times when I had some complaints with the writing. A number of lines that seemed like they were meant to be profound fell flat for me. Especially in the voice-overs that open and close the movie. The acting was pretty good for the most part. No surprise that I thought Benicio del Toro, Selma Hayek, and John Travolta were the highlights in that regard. I could watch Benicio del Toro play a sociopath for hours on end.

Finally, I have to say something about the ending, so here is my SPOILER ALERT. I am just not sure what to make of the ending. Unlike most movies this movie had two endings, and to be honest, I found them both unsatisfying. The first ending is unsatisfying because all the good guys die, the second is unsatisfying because it is basically a farce and anti-climactic. I have to say, I felt a brief moment of relief when the movie decided to rewind and replay the ending, because I did find the first ending unsatisfying, but it was sort of a slap in the face to be presented with another, almost equally unsatisfying ending, to replace the first. Not only did I find both endings to the movie unsatisfying, but I found the fact that there were two endings in the first place to be unsatisfying, and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why Stone decided to do that. It does not seem to me to serve any purpose. Neither ending seems to me to be making a point, or serve any artistic purpose. There is a ""feel bad"" ending where all the good guys die, and a ""feel good"" ending where everyone lives, and all the good guys move to a tropical island and live happily ever after (that might be an exaggeration). I am someone who firmly believes that art does not exist to fulfill our ""human all too human desires"". The short stories of Anton Chekhov, for example, are beautiful stories, but they almost always leave the reader unsatisfied. They are also great works of art, and the dissatisfaction felt by the reader is part of the artistic message. So I am fine, in principle, with unsatisfying endings, if they serve some artistic purpose. I just cannot figure out why Stone decided to have not one, but two, unsatisfying endings?

It seems to me that you have two choices in regard to ending a movie: you can provide the satisfying ending, or you can decide to send a message with the ending. Since it does not seem to me that this movie was sending any very clear message with the ending, why not accept your status as an ""action"" flick, and just give the audience the satisfying ending they are craving, where the good guys triumph in a climactic gun battle, Lado (Benicio del Toro), who is the real villain of the film, gets what is coming to him, and everyone lives happily ever after. If you decide not to go either route, if you decide to provide an unsatisfying ending without sending any message, at least have the decency to give us ONE ending instead of TWO.

If it were not for the ending, I would not hesitate to recommend this film, as a compellingly watchable film. It does not, in my opinion, deal with deep themes (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Born-Killers/dp/B000HL093A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Born Killers</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Platoon-Special-Edition/dp/B00005AUJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Platoon (Special Edition)</a>), but it is a good, entertaining, watchable movie.

SAVAGES isn't a terrible film; don't read the 3 stars and think, ""Wow, he hates this movie.""  If I hated it, I'd give it one star, maybe two if there were some genuinely awesome moments.  SAVAGES is a decent film with some great elements, mainly the supporting cast: Benicio del Torro and Salma Hayek play three-dimensional villains, while John Travolta turns in a smarmy, enjoyable performance as a corrupt DEA agent (he's always at his best when he sinks his fangs into a villainous role).  Look too for a cameo from Shea Whigham; it makes you wish he was in the movie more.

The major problems with SAVAGES lie with the script and the directing.  The former offers the three leads little to do.  Taylor Kitsch (JOHN CARTER), Aaron Johnson (KICK ASS), and Blake Lively (THE TOWN) are all capable of delivering better performances than this.  It's just, their characters--lifted from Don Winslow's novel--are utterly two-dimensional.  One scene in particular could've let Kitsch show his range--but instead of being as powerful and effective as writers Winslow, Stone, and Shane Salerno intended, it comes off as flat and emotionless.

That brings us to the direction.  Oliver Stone has given us some great films, both as a writer (SCARFACE) and director (WALL STREET).  Now, SAVAGES is arguably the best full movie he's made since 1999's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY; I say full because the first 2/3 of WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS were quite good (but the final third was so awful that people tend to forget that fact).  But saying SAVAGES is his best recent effort isn't saying much, considering what we're comparing it to.  Occasionally, Stone presents us with glimmers of his old self, but overall the direction is surprisingly lazy, considering this is the man who gave us the frenetically-feverish NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  It's almost as though Stone is trying to marry that film with the weirdness of his later U TURN, but the marriage is a fitful one.  Ultimately, SAVAGES doesn't come off quite as good as it could have.  It's entertaining, mostly, though the script doesn't try hard to keep your attention, and you really don't care about the fate of the three main characters.  It's a decent popcorn flick, but we expect more from Stone--though, given his recent track record, maybe we shouldn't.",1352851200,,2881,4.882716049382716

Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a former Navvy SEAL and Ben (Aaron Johnson), a talented chemist share two things. The best friends have one girlfriend O (Blake Lively) and they have a mutual love for marijuana. But these guys aren't just guys who have a couple of plants on their patio.
Chon smuggled some special seeds out of Afghanistan, and the strain of marijuana they have produced is particularly potent.
They have a state of the art growing facility, have hired computer hackers to hide their money and Ben has a longtime goal to stay overseas doing charity work.
But their business is so good they have attracted some very bad attention. A cartel enforcer Lado (Benicio del Toro) sends them a video of severed heads and a chainsaw. The Mexican cartel offers a solution, a partnership.
Chon, the more seasoned of the two, tells Ben the cartel will not take ""no"" for an answer. They meet, and then ask for time to think about it. They make plans to leave with O, and go to Indonesia for at least a year.
The cartel knows something is up, so kidnap O.
Chon and Ben go to a corrupt DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) who has turned a blind eye to their business in exchange for a cut. What he doesn't tell the boys is he's also in bed with the cartel.
They decide the only way to get O back is to strike at the cartel's business, and make it appear like it's an inside job. This is a tough, gritty crime thriller that only Oliver Stone could oversee.",1352332800,,1499,4.431159420289855

The story line starts with the Mexican Cartel and I found this very realistic.
It moves on to Pot, this too is done very well.
Through in a crooked DEA Agent (Travolta) and Benicio as a Cartel honcho and it is a perfect fit.

4778000,3,B005LAII94,"Can two men share a woman and stay friends? Can a small, independent group of marijuana dealers take on a Mexican cartel? Has Oliver Stone lost his touch?

  We are given a brief history of two of the lead characters, Ben and Chon (played by Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch) by their girlfriend and the film's narrator O (short for Ophelia, played by Blake Lively). Ben (Johnson) is a college graduate who majored in business and botany. Chon (Kitsch) is a veteran who returned from Afghanistan with the seeds that became an extremely potent form of marijuana and the foundation of their successful business. Ben contributes a great deal of his income to worthy causes and travels extensively. While he's away, O and Chon receive a video containing numerous severed heads and chainsaw. They fear Ben has been killed until he returns home a short time later. They had a scheduled meeting with the cartel and so, they go ahead with it. The cartel representatives propose that Ben and Chon join their organization, but rather than consider their offer, they say they take the time they've been given to consider it and make plans to flee the country. A DEA agent named Dennis (played by John Travolta) tells them that the partnership is the best option. They disagree but, before they can leave the country, O is kidnapped. Ben and Chon hear this directly from Elena Sanchez, the leader of the cartel who ordered it. Elena (played by Salma Hayek) tells the two men that she intends to hold O hostage until they honor the terms of their agreement. During that time, she's held prisoner amid miserable surroundings and guarded by a cartel henchman who goes by Lado (played by Benicio del Toro).

  Now, regardless of what anyone might say about its historical accuracy, or lack thereof, I greatly enjoyed JFK. Same goes for Wall Street, Nixon, The Doors and Born on the Fourth of July. I thought Any Given Sunday was alright, but nowhere near as good as the others I've mentioned. I don't know if this movie's failure is something to be blamed on Stone, the actors or the source material, but the story didn't really go anywhere and the characters were completely unrealistic. I'm not saying I won't watch it again, but I certainly won't pay for the opportunity.",1350518400,,2257,4.744897959183674
4778001,2,B005LAII94,"The first thing Savages does is to pull a punch: in a sweaty basement imprisoned Mexican workers are captured on home video suffering atrocities, off screen, at the hands of a chainsaw-wielding sadist. It's meant to be a bracer, but it doesn't quite shock because it only implies, and is followed too quickly by opening credits scrolling prettily over Southern California sun and sand, beautiful people frolicking in rolling, reverb-drenched surf guitars.

An odd dissonance: an opening which doesn't know whether to be Arthur or Martha. It's kind of a theme.

Over stylish fast-cut editing we meet our narrator, a girl called O (Blake Lively). O (for Ophelia, which we're helpfully informed is from Hamlet) is the fulcrum of the film, and she introduces dual heroes Ben and Chon, both of whom are her boyfriend. Dual heroes. They're good drug dealers. We meet some bad ones soon enough: the dudes with the chainsaw.

Amongst our dual heroes we have a sensitive one, Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and a hard bastard, Chon (Taylor Kitsch). They are a Cheech & Chong for the net generation: they're even name-checked that way. Only they're not as funny. They share O: it's a yin and yang thing. A Bizarre love triangle, then? Some submerged fear and loathing between the beaux? Underplayed. Implausibly underplayed. Thus the whole three-way relationship, which you would think would ooze of it, seems contrived.

In any case, why have two heroes, if not to harvest the drama that flows from the submerged resentment between them? It is as if Oliver Stone can't make up his mind: it speaks to a muddle-headedness with which the picture is shot through. For now, though, no matter: early exchanges are slick, voguish and handsome, being not troubled much by way of plot exposition.

Things start to fall apart when Stone moves onto that job. To do so he dials back the modish editing, but without that distraction, a preposterous screenplay reveals itself. The vibe is confused: my best guess is that Stone is shooting for Quentin Tarantino's blend of irony and brutality, but Savages isn't nearly cool enough to carry it off. For one thing, Stone doesn't trust us to be hip to his references, so explains: ""IED - that means improvised explosive device"". (We are told this particular fact twice.) Perhaps this is meant for viewers who are thinking of the contraceptive coil.

Now a Roberto Rodriguez or a Quentin Tarantino would never patronise his audience in that way - he would expect you to keep up: no concessions for laggards; and when he sought ironic belly laughs he would therefore get them. In Savages, the theatre's laughter, which grew bolder as the picture wore on, was not ironic. It was embarrassed: Did someone really ask Benicio Del Toro to say that? And he did?

Del Toro, then: The more we see of him and his cohort of Mexican provocateurs, the less menacing they are. Del Toro's accent is direct from Ren & Stimpy.  He wears a ridiculous wig. Despite doing despicable and ultraviolent things he seems content to play for laughs.

His boss, also in a ridiculous wig, is Salma Hayek. She is a drug lord. Salma Hayek a drug lord? Good lord. Poor Hayek is way out of her depth, hobbled by an atrocious script and required to play a character riven with so many contradictions it is a wonder she doesn't spontaneously implode: by the end of the picture, fairly much, she has done. In the mean time, characters labour over exposition, frequently telegraphing it to each other - literally - over skype. But then, for daggers-drawn blood rivals, they also spend more time than I would visiting each other boldily. Especially since they're meant to be in different countries.

In fairness, Stone keeps the pace up and the picture is never less than entertaining. John Travolta has a whale of a time as a bent DEA agent playing every angle, but this is not his Pulp Fiction of the 2010s.

Fundamentally, the flimsy superstructure of Stone's enterprise has no chance of supporting the colossal weight of ludicrousness that Don Winslow's premise hoists upon it.  By the time we get to the most equivocal ending I can remember - yet again, Stone seems to want to have a bob each way, as if the focus group screening came out split 50/50, so he puts both endings in - the whole edifice is strewn across the landscape, a blast radius wider than one of Chon's IEDs*.

First, this movie has no identity as tries to become too many things to various audiences that could never mesh. It tries to follow in the footsteps of ""Traffic"" (excellent film btw) but because it takes a huge deviation, it ends up being a mix between the ""Real-World-MTV"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" What really unnerved me was 1.) Blake Lively narrating a movie and 2.) the casting. For the life of me, I don't know why Travolta and Del Toro would sully their reputations by choosing to work with such hipster amateurs. These are established thespians and not merely some ""appeal to the mindless philistine masses"" entertainers as is Lively and her two young co-stars.

What also phased me out, was the fact that Lively's character promulgated her fantasies upon the audience such as when justifying her tactless promiscuity, she claims that both men are really one and their opposites complete each other. With a theme as serious as the one Stone wanted to portray being obfuscated with Blake's voice, presence, and general infantile character, seriously destroyed the credibility of this flick from the beginning. And how does Stone compensate for the lack of substance? As all contemporary Hollywood flicks do, with an over-saturation of violence to shock the non-cineastes into believing the movie is actually ""great,"" because they saw a few explosions and gory scenes.

 Lastly, the truly sad part is this may be Oliver Stone's swan song, or rather his ""bridge too far."" This is probably where his credibility as an elite director takes a Bell Shaped curve for the worst. He had his greats, but this is either a bump in the road or the beginning of the end. I definitely would not recommend for those who are film aficionados or more appropriately ""cineastes.""

  * Blake Lively (""Gossip Girl""), a California blonde, is O, a delectable dimwit who loves BOTH of the guys in their little mnage  trois. When taken hostage, her chronic drug use backfires on her.
  * Aaron Johnson (""Albert Nobbs"") is Ben, the soulful botanist who has developed a highly marketable variety of marijuana.
  * John Travolta (""From Paris With Love""), sporting one face-lift too many, is Dennis, the go-to guy in the government, who plays all sides against the middle.

  I left the theater wanting to ask for my money back. It was very clear that Stone phoned this one in. The majority of the dark humor, that was so prevalent in the book, has been erased from the movie. A perfect example of this is the exclusion of O's mother from the movie. That character is wonderfully amusing and gave great insight into the character of O. The one exception to this is John Travolta as Ben and Chan's FBI contact. He turns in a wonderfully wacky and entertaining performance that I feel is on par with his Pulp Fiction turn. Travolta seems to be the only one who looked at the source material.
I also have to address the ending. There has never been a more blatant example of a studio forcing a director to change an ending. It is weird awkward and just plain embarrassing.

The characters were really standard, we have California girl, ex-marine hardass, and stoner-genius Buddhist, all as a threeway couple that only exists in Oliver Stone's mind.

The stoner-genius' employees all seemed like they belonged in a Mac commercial and really didn't serve much purpose to the overall movie, stoner-genius could've just said ""I've got our tracks covered"", and BAM! 20 minutes cut down.

The saving grace of Savage's characters however is that they're all played incredibally well, the actors breathe life into these stale hollow stereotypes and make them empathetic real people, really impressive on the actors parts, especially the guy who played stoner-genius and Salma Hayek. O herself seemed more like a fantasy character to get this whole story in motion but she was O-k (didja gettit??). Benecio Del Toro was wonderful, and I never thought I'd care to see him and John Travolta in the same room, but the scene where they were together was wonderful, they played off each other like a game of tennis. If you're a Benecio fan another movie similar-ish to this that I'd recommend is Way of the Gun, another hostage taken over the border thing.

Savages had a really nice style to it though which I'm sure you can tell just by that cover, it captured Southern California and Mexico perfectly and the main characters I could easily see living there.

The Story was really, REALLY, basic, a California girl gets kidnapped and her two boyfriends (only in Oliver Stone's fantasy) will do whatever it takes to get her back from the Mexican Cartel or whoever that kidnapped her. There's about 30 minutes well establishing who the characters are and how they live their good lives, the calm before the storm I guess, then after the girl gets kidnapped the guys go over for a bit what to do and how to do it, and eventually they decide to attack one of their deals and pin it on one of their own men, problem with that is this whole part takes about an hour. For the most part we see the Cartel trying to figure out what happened, *snooze*.

Then when we finally get to the ending scene they do a standard hostage tradeoff that goes in opposite directions for no apparent reason. At first we see the guys shoot all the Mexicans, then the stoner-genius gets shot in the throat and the marine and the girl basically commit suicide so they can die with him, then suddenly we hear ""but that's how I wish it'd go down"" and suddenly we see them back at the same deal 2 minutes ago and a helicoptor pops out and arrests Salma Hayek while everyone else gets away scott-free, WHAT?!??! Not only does Oliver Stone give us a false ending for NO REASON, he goes with the most cliche happy ending that completely contradicts the trailer/opening of the movie where the girl says ""I'm not alive by the end of this"", yeah bulls***. Also why did she want everyone to die? It's like Oliver Stone used the last couple of pages of the script to wipe his ass then threw it at the production company and told them to interpret that into the story.

Also an interesting aspect in the story that was just dropped which was when the Cartel saw the weakness in stoner-genius and made him finish killing someone they tortured, meanwhile O is watching on a security camera. They could've gone many ways with this, O getting Stockholm's Syndrome because she sees what horrible things her lover did, the guys turning 'savage' on the Cartel and executing Salma Hayek's daughter after getting O back, so much damn potential and they pretty much just forget about that part and we see the three of them holding hands and smiling in Indonesia or something, blech.

My main problem with Savages is that almost nothing happens story-wise, it's so straightforward, the Cartel kidnaps someone the guys love, so they kidnap someone the head-honcho loves and they tradeoff, all that other stuff going on in the story just felt like filler because it doesn't change anyone's course of action throughout the dragging 2 hours, leaving the whole experience feeling rather vapid and pointless. I didn't read the book so I don't know how it plays out there but simply from a movie standpoint the story could've used a few rewrites and an editor. The whole reason Savages exists is cinematic catharsis for gringos who are frustrated with all the horrendous acts going on right across the border, and little more.",1343001600,,5035,4.714772727272727
