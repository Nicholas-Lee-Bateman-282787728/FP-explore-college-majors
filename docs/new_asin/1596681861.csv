7799797,5,1596681861,"Quilting Arts Workshop - Expression Session - Creating Vivid Mixed-Media Fabric - With Alisa Burke in my opinion is very motivational for seasoned individuals as well as for those who are new to textile arts. She shares a great deal of information in a clear manner. She is eager to encourage viewers to simply use what we already have which is a PLUS. The viewer DOES NOT have to break the bank to buy special products to create beautiful cloths or papers.  Though many of the ideas may be old hat to the seasoned fabric designer, the information offered can serve the seasoned viewer as a reminder of what is available. Let's face it no one knows or has used every technique for designing fabrics. For those new to this art form, it is a wonderful eye-opener. Keep in mind when viewing that Alisa Burke has her own style. However through her stylized designs, she opens the door to examples of what can be used to develop ones own creativity. Viewers can layer and layer and layer designs as Alisa has done or can back off. It is up to the individual. Nevertheless texture, color and execution of ideas are presented, which makes this DVD informative. This DVD is a keeper as it stimulates the imagination. This DVD is also well worth the money as the entire DVD is full of information and does not offer any unneeded time fillers or what I call ""dead visuals"". I would like to see more DVD from Alisa Burke which takes us to the next step.",1312675200,,1442,4.482889733840304
