2884130,3,B000SBAVGY,"Well, it's hard to go wrong with so many movies at such a low cost, or so I thought. The truth is I needn't have bothered. I have only viewed half of the films because it's so laborious to wade through the junk. Most are simply awful movies with appalling video quality, similar to YouTube, and that's bad YouTube. A few of the films were curiously better, almost like broadcast quality, but the majority are just unwatchable junk. Sorry, I would like to say that for a bargain price you can't go wrong, but the fact is these are almost all, unviewable junk. My advice? Slowly build a library of classic sci-fi, albeit at higher prices.",1233446400,4,636,4.491379310344827
2884131,5,B000SBAVGY,I got this collection for my dad who is a huge movie buff. He was blown away by the collection.,1232755200,,95,3.8
2884132,2,B000SBAVGY,"Seems like a good idea at the time.  I'm a big movie buff.  Even bigger sci-fi movie buff.  100 of these suckers all in one small box.  And for outrageously low price!  What can go wrong?  Plenty.  For one thing, if you're not a B-Movie fan, you gonna hate everyone of these.  The word ""classic"" here is not meant to be gem or all-time favorite as it is doubtful you will find any of these movies in the top sci-fi movie list.  In this context, ""classic"" is meant oldies or in this case B-movie oldies...somewhat deceptive marketing, but I guess they figure you can look at the list of movies on the back of the box.  I'm not an oldies film expert, so I'm clueless and took their word for it, but after watching one dvd (6 movies), I realized these are going to be B-movies and I'm not going to enjoy the 94 other movies!  Just watching 6 is painful enough.  I have to force myself to watch one after another...figure I should at least watch one dvd, but just thinking I have another one to watch is not a good feeling.  I think I'm just going to stick with what I know from now on.",1211760000,5,1082,4.169082125603865
2884133,3,B000SBAVGY,"This collection would be more suitably named something other than ""Sci-Fi Classics""  None of the films here are classics in any sense of the word and many of them aren't even sci-fi, but the set does cover an awful lot of territory for a very reasonable price.  There is everything here from an early silent movie to 1950's cold-war paranoia alien invasion films, and from Steve Reeves Hercules escapades all the way to Amazon warrior women and giant spiders.  I've always been a fan of these kinds of movies and there are a few unexpected gems buried here.  As someone mentioned, the transfer quality is iffy and sometimes truly horrible in that some of the films appear to have come from second or even third-generation VHS copies.  Nevertheless I'm looking forward to spending the occasional Sunday afternoon with a bag full of popcorn happily viewing something from this rather eclectic collection.",1210377600,37,902,4.947019867549669
2884134,4,B000SBAVGY,"Let's get the ""down side"" out of the way immediately:

Video quality on budget-priced DVD sets is not always suitable for hi-def or big screen TVs. These discs work best on standard size tube sets.
Audio levels from this manufacturer have in the past been somewhat low-- yet not unlistenable if you have a decent sound system.

And now the ""up side"":

A hundred unusual selections for 30 cents apiece!
Compact packages. Especially with MILL CREEK sets, thousands of movies can easily fit on a single shelf.
Lesser-known films and genuine obscurities-- great for avid collectors.
Months of entertainment in a single box.

The SCI-FI 100 MOVIE PACK doesn't offer anything not previously released by this manufacturer. It does however convienently bring together several genres of American, Japanese and European 'B' movies. Besides science fiction this set also contains horror, fantasy, swords & sandals and mystery films.

An example of a non-sci-fier would be ""How Awful About Alan."" This Aaron Spelling TV movie is more of a mystery-drama than anything else. It's the story of a man with psychosomatic blindness due to guilt over his father's death. Alan is convinced someone is trying to harm him, and he just may be right.

There's not room to comment on the other 99 movies here. You can see from the list below that this is an unusual gathering, to say the least.

Another mammoth MILL CREEK item is their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HORROR-100-MOVIE-PACK-24pc/dp/B000NVIGD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HORROR 100 MOVIE PACK (24pc)</a>. It'll keep you screaming for many a full moon!

and one more I can't find the name to. As with most of mill Creek's release the transfers are average at best.

It's full of low budget sci fi flicks with bad/old special effects, far-fetched plots, and bad acting.  I just watched Santa Claus Conquers The Martians last night.  Like most DVD videos, these have scene selection menus, but they're really just four roughly equally spaced points in the movie.  Not a complaint, just letting you know.  Also be aware that of the few movies I have watched, most don't seem to have full end-credits.  I don't know if they were not available or not included in the original, or if they were just left out.

2884146,2,B000SBAVGY,"Yes, the headline is a little harsh, but honestly, I can't recommend this title.

I wasn't expecting great quality. I wasn't expecting great movies. But I was expecting it to be mostly science fiction. That just isn't the case. This collection features far too many werewolves, ""Sons of Hercules"" and gorillas, and far too few laser beams, goofy aliens, and flying saucers.

I would also complain that I was under the impression that it would be mostly B-movies from the 50s and 60s. You know, just what you'd expect from a title like ""Sci-Fi Classics"". (That's probably my fault for buying what I wanted it to be rather than researching it more carefully. Nice work Mill Creek!) Sadly, this collection features a large selection of what look like bad ""Movies of the Week"" and failed TV pilots from the 70s and 80s.

There are definitely some quirky gems here, but as I go through the disks I find myself ""passing"" more than ""playing"".",1321315200,2,935,4.723926380368098

The combination of the 2 should have been mentioned in the product description. However, the price was cheap so it's no great loss. I'll give ""Nightmare Worlds as a gift. Quality and movie selection is poor, but I expected that having bought another collection from the company. Some of the movies elevate Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" to Oscar level acting. However, some are interesting like seeing Richard Hatch (from Battlestar Galctica-original and new series)in a movie earlier in his acting career.",1319414400,4,796,5.130769230769231

Sure, some of the movies are more horror than pure science fiction, but genres tend to overlap. The movie, Disappearance of Flight 412, receives an honorable mention because it was the reason for my purchase of this collection in the first place (3 out of 5).

Of the movies watched thus far, the following stand out among the pack:

1. Robot Pilot: Brilliant moments of great comedy (4 out of 5)
2. Terror At the Red Wolf Inn: Surreal horror with very good acting (4 out of 5)
3. All the Kind Strangers: Novel story with very good acting (5 out of 5)",1304812800,3,715,4.288888888888889

It is fun seeing some well-known actors that likely started out (or ended up) in these less-than-stellar films.  Regardless, they make great Saturday night beer & popcorn viewing.  Best of all, you can't beat the price of 20 cents a movie even with some being bombs.

November 2011 Update:  I have finally managed to watch over half of the movies in this collection.  Some look like they were student films (using friends and family for actors and done around their home), some were made for TV, some were serial compilations from the 30's and 40's and some were actual low-budget Hollywood productions.  A few were so badly made (usually due to an abysmal script and/or acting) that I only watched them for 10-15 minutes.",1299628800,3,951,4.7975460122699385

So as last resort I went to HH Gregg,bought the cheapest dvd player,some Y plugs,hooked into same line,and can watch them all. Why HH Gregg,because they have better stuff and prices than anyone including Wallyworld,and if you have a prob.they take care of it there,your not stuck dealing with China.",1292284800,2,489,4.833333333333333

2884154,3,B000SBAVGY,"a collection of sci-fi movies, action and horror.  this collection are of movies that range from grade c to grade z.  this is possibly the worst collection of movies. playing some of the movies were hard. transfering the movies to the dvds appears to affect the quality of the movies but nothing can be said of the directors, writers and producers of the movies, i can even fathom the excuse for what they were thinking when making these movies.  avoid at all cost",1288137600,,464,4.566265060240964
2884155,2,B000SBAVGY,"Stock full of horror movies but very few good Sci-Fi ones. I was looking for old 1950 movies on Space Adventure. Although B-rated in most cases, I remember seeing some fairly good ones from time to time, over the years. I was hoping that this set would at least contain a couple of good movies, but to me, it appears to be mostly horror.",1287705600,,337,4.28125
2884156,3,B000SBAVGY,"It got three stars because it is more fantasy than Science Fiction.  There is nothing Sci-Fi about The Son of Hercules.  Some of the movies are CLASSICS and some are not!  Nuff said.  Truthfully, I am only half way through the deck, and so far, I have not found any that rate being a frisbee.  If any oldsters remember Elvira's movie show, most of these would and have been on her show.",1286323200,3,386,4.305555555555555

2884158,4,B000SBAVGY,"Mill Creek Entertainment. If that doesn't tell you all you need to know, keep reading. These folks release large collections of low budget, low quality movies for very little money. Plus, the collection titles and package graphics are deliberately deceiving. However, if you're interested in forgotten movies from the bottom of the pond and/or want a whole bunch of movies for a few cents each, go for it. And, many of these movies will probably never be released in any other form. Who knows, you may even find a minor gem. But, if you think you're gonna get great, lost classics for a couple of bucks, it's time to wise up.

This collection of ""Sci-Fi Classics"" is extremely anemic in regard to actual classics.  In fact, several of these films aren't even sci-fi, and many qualify only if the definition is stretched to the limit.  The actual classics are the silent films, which are an acquired taste and definitely not for general audiences.  But I bought this huge collection of oddities and curiosities, used, for less than $20 dollars (+S&H) and have no complaints. Some were good enough to actually be entertaining, some were laughably bad and several were simply boring. But, if you're up for this kind of thing, buy it used and enjoy.",1280966400,7,1245,4.776744186046511
2884159,5,B000SBAVGY,"All those corny SciFi movies you never thought you'd watch all in one convenient collection! Hahaha. Some are really good and some are painfully boring, but it's a great collection to have, especially for those that don't have cable or anything (like me). Keep me entertained while doing household chores and help me relax at night before bed :)",1270425600,4,345,4.864406779661017
2884160,3,B000SBAVGY,"Bought this as a gift for hubby, he watched most of the movies almost without stopping ... BUT, most of them are more mystery than sci-fi, in that it's a complete MYSTERY as to how a lot of them could be classified SCI-FI!?!  FUN though, some are of the variety where they are ""so bad that they're good!"", a lot of fun, and loads of familiar faces over the years.",1265155200,4,363,4.185714285714286

2884162,5,B000SBAVGY,"I bought these movie classics, for my adult son. These movies I grew up on!

2884163,3,B000SBAVGY,"this collection is far from being essential. but if one is interested in films beyond hollywood and associates this is interesting. this is not auteur-cinema either.
most of it is pretty bad story telling, bad acting, and very cheap effects. if you are interested in the history of film in general this is interesting. many of the film are not
sci-fi either - unless you are willing to extend the definition of science fiction largely. so, if you like C and D movies and can enjoy their unwanted humor and historic
outlook specially bad productions offer, this is for you. if you are looking for popcorn cinema and good entertainment - this is probably not for you. having said that:
there are certainly a few gems hidden in this box as well..",1252022400,3,743,4.636363636363637
2884164,3,B000SBAVGY,"Its a real good collection of cheese fest sci-fi films for the B movie fan, but this collection is simply the ""Sci-fi"" 50 pack combined with the ""Nightmare Worlds"" 50 pack. Together they'll run you about $25. So save yourself about $15 and just get the two 50 packs separately.",1246924800,17,277,4.56

There were only 2 movies that I enjoyed (The Wasp Women, and The Day The Sky Exploded). A good deal of the movies were not Sci Fi. How would ""Radio Ranch"" starring Gene Autrey be considered Sci Fi. And a few of the movies were nasty and distasteful.",1479686400,,344,4.2272727272727275
