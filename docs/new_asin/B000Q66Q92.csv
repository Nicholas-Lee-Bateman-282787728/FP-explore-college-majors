2829768,3,B000Q66Q92,"These two movies are decently funny, but not in a witty way.  Rowan Atkinson is really a comic genius, and in his earlier English comedy routines and TV appearances, you see a totally different person.  ""Bean"" as a movie adaptation is OK, but if you've seen the show, the jokes are basically just recycled and overused.  ""Johnny English"" was funny to me as a teenager, but that was before I had seen Atkinson's stand-up comedy and the Bean show.  It was a commercial failure and poorly-rated, as ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"".
For the price you get two average comedies (Bean is a funnier character), but it isn't his best offering.",1256083200,2,624,4.697247706422019
2829769,5,B000Q66Q92,mr bean is one funny man. without saying a whole lot he can steal the whole movie. great comedy timing and a great animated face he is wonderfully entertaining.,1253059200,,160,4.551724137931035

2829772,5,B000Q66Q92,Two for the price of one! Neither movie particularly great - although there are plenty of laughs. Bean does better in short vignettes. But the price can't be beat!,1219968000,,163,4.655172413793103
2829773,4,B000Q66Q92,"The 2 movies are great.. picture and sound qualities are awesome. It is a lot of fun seeing this. Actually they should be rated 5 stars, but I rated them 4 stars since no dts sound.",1219795200,,181,4.055555555555555
2829774,5,B000Q66Q92,"This is a great way to get BOTH Bean-The Movie and Johnny English in one great DVD package,and it's got a cheap price tag too,much cheaper than buying the 2 DVD's seperately!!! Classic British comedy!!! A+ (Note though,I'm sure in the future a Franchise Collection will eventually be available that will include Mr. Beans Holiday too,not exactly sure,but we all know by now how the DVD companies are,but for now we got this collection to enjoy!) Still Recommended!!!",1219363200,,466,4.987179487179487

2829776,5,B000Q66Q92,"Classic ""Bean"" for those who love British humour, as I do. For those not familiar with Rowan Atkinson, his work has been compared to ""Charlie Chaplain,"" though not quite as ""slap stick."" There is a great deal of cleverness in his humour as well.  ""Bean"" reminds me of an overgrown 9-year-old boy doing his best not to be seen or get into trouble when in very embarassing situations. In ""Johnny English"", he spoofs James Bond. It is mostly very innocent humour that I can share with my young children.",1193184000,5,500,4.617977528089888
2829777,5,B000Q66Q92,"I have seen Bean: The Movie in theaters years ago and wanted to get a copy for my kids who have discovered Rowan Atkinson--with my help of course.  Since this set included a second feature I had yet to see, I decided ""Why not?"" because Rowan has never let me down before.  I found Johnny English to be a better satire about spies/police than the Steve Martin Pink Panther movie, which I still like.  So fun to watch Rowan in a ""cool guy"" mode, even with the devastating mistakes the character makes.",1192752000,9,499,4.4021739130434785
2829808,3,B000Q66Q92,I wanted Bean just because it is Mr. Bean.  The plot is ok.  fairly clever but not nearly up to the hilarity of the show.  Johnny English was pretty clever and fun.  i was surprised to see that the writers were also the writers of the last several 007 films so you know it's going to be good.,1433376000,,292,3.9827586206896552

2829810,4,B000Q66Q92,I really enjoy the Mr. Bean character. This film was fun to watch. I was surprised with how much I enjoyed Johnny English. It was a fun spoof of the James Bond films.,1428364800,,166,4.0606060606060606

2829857,2,B000Q66Q92,"Not a good double feature. I've watched Mr. Bean TV show and it is much better than Mr. Bean the Movie. I enjoy mute comedy like Laurel & Hardy but the script of this movie is kind of girlish and way too dumb. The other movie, Johnny English, is a much better and funnier movie. Much better acting and better directed. Basically, it is an over exploited plot: an agent and his partner try to solve a crime. How many times I've seen this plot is beyond me: Beverly Hills Cop, Rush Hour, Big Momma's House etc. Too repetitive and it can get boring at some points. If you have an option, just go with Johnny English and forget about Mr. Bean the movie. It's a waste of time. Movie specifics: There are two discs. Bean the Movie: double sided disc widescreen and full screen. Johnny English is only in the widescreen format.",1364169600,,820,4.366013071895424

2829890,5,B000Q66Q92,"These 2 Rowan Atkinson movies are great. I was hoping to find them on Blu-Ray but these DVDs are just fine too. I really only wanted Johnny English, but this was about the same price as buying it alone, so hey! great deal!",1358467200,,222,4.186046511627907
2829891,5,B000Q66Q92,"Rowan Atkinson is a British comedian best know for his ""Mr. Bean"" television skits. They're funny. Really funny. It takes a while to get used to his very strange antics and presentations but once you do, you're hooked. I ended up watching a series of 14 programs and wished there were more. It's a corny, very visual, slapstick type of humor and some of the acts are just hilarious.

Well, You just know that one day this guy is going to step away from television and start doing full-length movies and he has. I discovered an interesting ""Double Feature"" DVD with ""Bean: The Movie"" and ""Johnny English."" Both are movie farces of the type I used to watch in the 60s when I used to enjoy British comedies featuring star such as Alec Guiness, Peter Sellers and Terry Thomas. I reviewed both of these movies under their own titles and this is a summation applied to the double-feature disc.

In ""Bean: The Movie,"" Mr. Bean goes to Los Angeles along with a painting (Whistler's Mother) and ends up meeting the museum staff who regard him as Dr. Bean, a world art authority. Well, the British museum sent him along just to get rid of him, but the Americans take his presence very seriously. World authority? He's a buffoon, and everyone except the American Art experts are aware of it.. The movie is hilarious with all sorts of ridiculous sight gags and really bad acting.

In ""Johnny English"" Atkinson gets away from his Mr. Bean persona, but not very far, and protrays a James Bond-like Special Agent who is called in to protect the Queen's jewels. They're then stolen, of course, and Johnny English is one of the principle investigators trying to get them back. Pity the British. Everything English does he does wrong, and he practically lives with his foot in his mouth right up to the knee. It's funny, and there's some really good stunts with him driviing in the streets of London.

It's a good pair of movies and quite a bargain. I'd suggest you adjust yourself to watching Rowan Atkinson by watching the Bean episodes first. He's a really odd comedian and it takes a while to get used to his very physical humor.
