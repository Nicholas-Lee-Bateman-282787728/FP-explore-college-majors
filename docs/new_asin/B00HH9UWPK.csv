6162771,5,B00HH9UWPK,"Great DVDs! If you're a fan of this band or of this genre of music than this is a must have. Great set list. I love the sound of live recordings, I wish there were more DVDs like this.",1445904000,,184,3.7435897435897436
6162772,5,B00HH9UWPK,"This is a great buy for any Nightwish fan. The Storytime tour has a great set of songs, and Floor Jansen is amazing. The Blu-ray quality looks fantastic too. The extras on the second disc are great too. There's a nice documentary on their tour that is worth watching. This is a wonderful buy for any Nightwish fan.",1444867200,,314,4.431034482758621
6162773,5,B00HH9UWPK,"This is a great concert put on by one of the best symphonic metal groups around. Floor's voice is strong, the crowd is really into it, and the band puts on a very tight show. Everything is spot on. The camera angles may change a little too fast, but aside from that, this is a very entertaining DVD. The drummer is awesome. Too bad he is currently taking a break from the band. I highly recommend this DVD and band...it's a fresh change from all the American pop that is all flash and no substance. These songs are epic compositions, executed flawlessly by Nightwish. They toured for over a year, and it really shows in their performance. Buy it!!! Check out Within Temptation Black Symphony DVD also...you won't be sorry!!!",1443830400,,724,4.576923076923077
6162774,5,B00HH9UWPK,Excellent show and set list. A must watch for any Nightwish fan.,1433980800,,64,4.416666666666667
6162775,1,B00HH9UWPK,"This is a horrible DVD.  The music is great.  But, they don't stay with the same camera angle for more than 2 seconds!  Gave me a headache.  I could not watch the whole thing.  I'll just stick with the CDs.  Too bad, these guys are great fun to watch when you can focus on them.  They really put on a show.  I would have liked to have seen it.  I watched the DVD (some of it), but did not see the show.  A waste of money.

As for the music, it is remakes of old songs with Floor proving she has the range and energy to carry it off.",1429315200,2,532,3.7889908256880735
6162776,5,B00HH9UWPK,This was one great DVD.  The band at their best.,1419033600,2,48,3.8
8632698,5,B00HH9UWPK,Picture and sound quality are phenomenal.,1520035200,,41,6.0
8632699,5,B00HH9UWPK,Love the bands music and now I can see the band perform without going overseas to see them in concert!  A must see if you love the band!,1519862400,,136,3.857142857142857
8632700,5,B00HH9UWPK,Watched a lot of it on youtube (one song at a time) so nice to have it so I don't have to watch it one song at a time !!,1516752000,,120,3.033333333333333
8632701,4,B00HH9UWPK,"Excellent concert, but the documentary I found lacking. From the title I was expecting the story about how exactly Floor got ""summoned"" and learned the songs in 48 hours! No details.",1501459200,,182,4.903225806451613
8632702,5,B00HH9UWPK,Great concert (disc 1) and background story (disc 2). Excellent music & visual.,1498348800,,79,5.153846153846154
8632703,5,B00HH9UWPK,"If you're not yet a fan of the band, and especially if you've never seen them live, it's a great introduction to their energy and style. If you're already a fan, then get ready for a great set recorded during their first tour with Floor Jansen behind the mic. The video and sound quality are excellent; the only complaint I had is how the editing between cameras was so fast paced; in some places the camera view changes around once a second.

I've been listening to the digital download of this concert for over a month now and am nowhere near tired of it.",1490745600,,557,4.355769230769231
8632704,5,B00HH9UWPK,"I love this Blu-ray.  The picture and sound quality is amazing.  The set list covers all of their best songs, and when they get to ""Last Ride of the Day"" I got goosebumps!  It's definitely my favorite concert recording now.  Some people complain about the fast camera switches, but I don't really mind that much.  The music is what is most important.  Such a high energy show of melodic perfection.  For any fans of Nightwish, this is, in my opinion, a must have.  I just wish I had found out about this band earlier (my first album was Imaginerium).",1482192000,,550,4.484848484848484
8632705,5,B00HH9UWPK,love to watch Nightwish in action! good concert/ extras are in Finnish with subtitles,1479600000,,85,5.142857142857143
8632706,5,B00HH9UWPK,"At this writing, this band is touring North America.  Very soon, everyone will know the name ""Nightwish"".  And Tuomas Holopainen will finally be recognized for the musical genius that he is. I met him briefly, he's soft-spoken, unassuming, humble. I want him/Nightwish to garner all the success, fortune and fame they deserve. They are hard-working, determined and devoted to their craft. And Floor Jansen is perfect for Nightwish. I don't know how she does it, night after night. She belts out ""Ghost Love Score"" with power like you've never seen onstage. She's amazing.  I hope they reach super-star status because as hard as they work, they truly deserve it.",1458086400,,661,5.045871559633028
8632707,5,B00HH9UWPK,"For anyone who enjoys this genre of music, symphonic rock,  this is an excellent concert.  Nightwish in top form and this concert video might well be considered something of a greatest Hits collection.  Their newest lead vocalist, Floor Jansen proves she has the range and stage presence to perform any song from this long time band's enormous repertoire.",1448496000,,355,5.086206896551724
