3534867,5,B001DN0US0,"That's not something I'd usually say about an anime, but Witchblade certainly merits it. This is, at the most basic level, a wonderful story about a mother's love, and what it really means to be a mother, all very cleverly wrapped up in an action packed anime full of hot, busty women in skimpy outfits. In fact the underlying thread is so well woven that it will sneak up on you if you're not careful. I'm the emotional type and I'm not ashamed to say that Witchblade moved me to tears, and if you're like me, have a good supply of tissues on hand -- but don't miss this one!",1254960000,3,576,4.245454545454545
3534868,5,B001DN0US0,"I often passed over this anime, fearing it would contain more fan service than actual content.  On a whim, I started watching it on YouTube.  After four episodes I was hooked.  This is one of those animes where you find yourself staying up way later than you should as you keep telling yourself ""Just one more DVD and then I'll go to sleep""; needless to say I watched the whole thing in one sitting.

The story and characters are fantastic, both the former and latter are deep and draw you in.  The animation is superb (fair warning:  there is a lot of fan service).

The product itself is contains 6 art/story inserts, and is 5 DVDs.  The first 4 DVDs each contain 6 episodes.  The last DVD contains trailers and commentary.  When you load the first 4 DVD discs, a preview will play that you cannot fast forward or hit DVD menu for; if you hit title menu, it will break you out and to the main screen.  The DVDs are packed in a fairly slim case consisting of four panels when fully opened.  The first panel is an episode list.  The second panel contains one DVD.  The third and fourth panels each contain two dvds, stacked and offset so as to not damage each other.  Overall, I am very pleased with the packaging of this anime.

I highly recommend this anime.  You will not be disappointed.

One final note:  This anime is violent, contains adult themes, and contains a high level of fan service.  I do not recommend it for children.",1252627200,,1434,4.400763358778626
3534869,5,B001DN0US0,"Watched this with my daughter and it was fun with a great soundtrack, story and artistry.",1244246400,,89,4.625
3534870,5,B001DN0US0,"When this series first came out I didn't pay any attention to it. About two months ago my older brother bought the box set and he loved it and a week ago he let me borrow it. The anime is loosely based off the comic which I read and really liked. Still I wasn't expecting to much from the series but I was wrong.

The story was very good. Focusing on the mother (Masane) and daughter(Rihoko) relationship. The Witchblade plays a secondary role in the anime which I thought was good. The two problems with the story was the back story of the blade which they never even hinted at. The biggest problem though was the ending. It was plain terrible, you can tell it was rushed. I know there are many reasons a anime series ends to soon. From being unpopular to running out of money, but they could have at least tried to make a coherent ending. They should have extended it to 26 episodes that would have been more than enough time to give a ending to the series.

Perhaps the best part of the series were the characters. Masane and Rihoko were great as mother and daughter. They brought the emotion to the series and you end up really caring for them. The other characters from Reiji, Hiroki, Shiori and the rest all add something to the series.

The animation done by GONZO was brilliant, but what do expect from one of the best anime studios. The music was also outstanding.

Overall a great anime worth watching, but prepare to be a little let down with the ending.",1240704000,,1465,4.375

3534872,4,B001DN0US0,"Let me start by saying that I love, love, love this series.  I was hooked from the first episode to the last, and was extremely happy.  However, I was shocked to find a large, deep gouge in the last disc when I first opened the package, one that made it impossible for me to watch the last 5 episodes (on a 6-episode disc) without going out and buying a disc buffer.  Amazon's return policy states that DVDs can only be returned with the original plastic wrapping, so I had no choice but to go and spend more money to repair an item that shouldn't have been damaged in the first place.  If I'd bought it in a store, I could have simply exchanged it for a different, undamaged copy--and I could have done it on the day the DVD set came out instead of three days later.  All in all, I'm disappointed with my Amazon shopping experience.",1227398400,2,833,4.280254777070064
3534873,5,B001DN0US0,"Not as sexy and violent as advertised, but it makes up for it with great characters and story.",1227312000,,94,4.277777777777778
3534874,5,B001DN0US0,"I have passed over this Anime many times, because I don't like the American comic. I only gave it consideration because my brother in-law recommended it.

Well saying ""I don't like the comic"" is unfair... I'm sure the writing is good and Top Cow is known for producing quality products (high quality graphics, paper, toys, etc... etc...) But, the Witchblade logo reminds me too much of the Thundercats logo. And additionally I don't like the American style art that original source material has. Just MHO.

I'll stop talking about that before I find someone at my doorsteps upset with me for bashing the most popular new comic of the last decade. New is relative... considering franchises like Superman have been around for 60 plus years I think.

THIS Version of Witchblade However... is stunning! The story is deep and valid. It is the classic heroes journey, and it is absolutely fantastic!

Watching this immediately makes me think of one of my other absolute favorite anime franchises... Elfen Lied. Just like Elfen Lied they contrast hyper-violence with powerfully moving relationships... Beauty and the Beast wrapped into in one person then pumped up on ""sexy-violence steroids"" to end up with a really high contrast product.

The women are outrageously sexy and usually that just doesn't do it for me when it comes to anime. Sometimes I'm put off when the fan service levels are this high. See my reviews on Misuki Chronicles and you will see that I'm just saying this.

The fan service is REALLY REALLY high on this, almost to the point of ridiculous. But the content of the story and the high impact action just makes that something that has to be overlooked.

This is another keeper for the collection... and I feel it is a must own. Dare I say the success of this could set a new trend... I can see that many other comic producers would want to jump on this bandwagon the same way they did with ""digital comic painting"" back in the early 90's when Image Studios launched that boat for the first time.

Top Cow apparently gave Gonzo/Funimation creative freedom on this because it is remarkably different from the American version. In my opinion that is good...

The only constant is the Witchblade. Which really demonstrates the thinking of Top Cow... The Witchblade is a great tool for telling many stories... very clever... and remarkably strategic in the market place.

Should you own this? I would say... Sell what ever you gotta sell to get this into your collection... The images are so stunning, and the story is so powerful you would be crazy to pass on this one... (Like I did for quite a while.)

I regret not getting this sooner because I have picked up some pretty mediocre anime lately and that money would have been much better spent on this title at twice the price.

In summary:
The Action - Rivetingly Awesome. Complete edge of your seat stuff.

The Fan Service - Super sexy but not offensive.

The Story - Very compelling. (My wife and I watched the 4 DVDs that have the story on them in just 1 sitting. We pulled an all-nighter on the couch to watch all of this... it is that good.)

The Production Quality - Really high... very little in the market place is better today. (Perhaps the folks that did the new Appleseed might have higher production standards.)

The audio quality - Superb. I don't like the opening song but the audio is normalized well so you don't have to keep adjusting the sound when action changes to dialog. It is very easy to clearly hear what is being said. And the rest of the music is really good for the show...

The artwork - The quality of the cover art is not as good as the anime and the box cover art is pretty high quality. The overall artistic rendering during the animation is very clean and will likely stand the test of time. (Again I'm not real big on American Comic Style Art)

The box quality - This is pretty good. I would have to say this, while excellent, is the weakest link. The fold out thingy has some great artwork on it that is clearly a different artist than the cover artist.

Overall 5 stars but I wish I could give it more.

You will like this I'm 100% sure of it.",1226793600,32,4146,4.569500674763833
3534875,5,B001DN0US0,"I give this anime series 10 stars if it would let me. This series rocks. Witchblade is so cool.

3534876,5,B001DN0US0,"The Good Things
*Has good video and sound quality.
*Comes with a number of extras; making-of featurettes, interviews, textless songs, trailers, and outtakes.  It is all allocated on disc five, while the rest of the show takes up the first four discs.
*Comes in a nice slim box, with all of the discs on a fold-out thing and all associated booklets in its own envelope (just like with the complete box set of ""Burst Angel,"" ""Speedgrapher,"" or ""Samurai 7"").  Has a lot of cool artwork.
*Good amount of exciting action and fighting.
*Very good animation style and quality.
*Very good production desgin.  The characters look phenomenal, the settings look interesting, and the Witchblade weapon itself is incredibly awesome.
*The main character has some very big...ahem...fan service.
*Aside from that, the protagonist is a great character who shows compelling emotion and awesome wickedness.  The other characters are great, and their drama is very immersive.
*Storyline is great, especially since this rendition is much more sci-fi and fantasy orientated.
*Look out for one or two inside jokes.

The Bad Things
*Don't know how accurate it is to the original comic book.  It is certainly different than the 2001 live-action TV show.  But this version is still quite enjoyable.
*Not for kids; rated TV-MA for bloody violence.

This anime version of the comic book ""Witchblade"" definately makes for some awesome anime.  It is exciting, and a good story with good characters.  There is hardly anything dull about this show, and is probably one of the best to have come out in recent years.  Highly reccomended to any anime fan, and probably to most fans of the comics.",1218844800,46,1661,5.025547445255475

3534891,4,B001DN0US0,The voice acting's pretty good. Anime style's good. Story's alright. But I remember this show was rated tvMA when i watched it on cable... but all they do is tease. There's no real nudity in this at all. I watched the dvds through and through and not one fully exposed breast. They may as well have taken full advantage of the rating if they were going to get so close to showing full nudity. But it's pretty good if it's you're first time watching. If you watched every episode on tv or through other means then you're not missing much on the dvd. Just extras and special features that's all,1464566400,5,592,4.390909090909091

3534954,5,B001DN0US0,"This is a pretty good series heres my reasons why

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) The story begins with a mother and daughter, the mother named Masane (nicknamed Melony) and her daughter Rihoko are moving (back like they lived there then moved away then moved back it was never fully explaned) to Tokyo to start a new life, when they get there they see the old city is destoryed because of an earthquake 6 years ago, and at the of the earthquake center of where the earthquake was both Masane and Rihoko, Rihoko was only a few months old and Masane holding her except her memory was erased. One day Rihoko was taken by the NSWF aka child warefare because Masane couldn't house Riohko right, Masane was taken to jail. While in jail a guy/machine breaks into the jail wanting to kill Masane when her wrist tattoo lights up and transforms Masane into the (lack of a better term or the fact they never named her other form) Witchblade Master. She fights off the machine and learns she is the keeper of the Witchblade which is the most powerful weapon in the world. Threw this series it show her efforts to fight these machines and learn more of the Witchblade.

Pros: The story is written. I love how much they pushed the whole ""you don't need to be blood releated to be a family"" because in the end (end being figure of speach) it seems like all the good guys in the show are all one big family. The fights are pretty good at times. Also I love how they use such raw emotions to make you feel so much for the characters even tho it may just be the first episode you're watching.

Cons: To me (and maybe just me) I feel like the information of some of the story was never really told as much as it could have been, like the Witchblade it self for instance, all they say is who ever has it (Anime Stereotype: only women) is the most powerful person in the world but it comes at a price. They never really say who made it or gave any back story to it at all.

Cons part 2: If you are one of those people who dosnt like nudity then this series MAY or may NOT be for you, by that im meaning when Masane transforms into the Witchblade Master or some of the Witchblade copies called Nerogenes, the women are just barly clothed, their downstairs privet parts are just covered by a tiny black cloth but their ass is fully shown. Just warning you.

Overall: I like this series! its a good series! BUY IT!!!",1408320000,,2405,4.300220750551876

3534968,5,B001DN0US0,"While many have discounted or ignored this series because of the serious ""jiggle physics"" and very skimpy costumes/uniforms of the women, this is actually a fairly deep and intense character driven drama that showcases the deep love between the main protagonist and her daughter as well as their willingness to do whatever it takes for them to stay together in spite of all the forces fighting to keep them apart.  You can't help but feel their pain and desperation as the government forces and the Witchblade itself try to tear Masane and her daughter, Rihoko, apart as well as Masane's desperate battle against a fate that she did not choose. It chose her.

The series really seems to get you into the feelings and emotions of Masane and her daughter, along with those of the other key characters. So don't let the apparent fan service component keep you from enjoying a really superb series.  The major characters, including the villains and villainesses are very well developed with good depth to their backgrounds so that you see their inner pains and turmoil that shaped them and understand why they are driven to behave the way they do. You also feel for them and the self destructive paths they have chosen.

The artwork is excellent as are the dub actors.  With some interesting and unexpected twists, this is really a terrific series that will not disappoint you and may even touch your heart.",1400284800,,1403,4.804979253112033

So much is going on, with different goals the other characters have, it is good to watch it a few times just to pick up on what you might have missed the first time through.  I bough this anime on a whim, I hadn't heard of it. I'm glad I did. This anime is about as close to real life characters as you'll get in any anime. I've read where some reviewers have pointed out how Dysfunctional the mom and daughter are. Nope, this is like real life. Most of the characters are damaged, but have survived. so it is with these people. a lively story, perhaps too science based, but you will get hooked. I would recommend this to any anime fan without reserve. Good stuff.",1399680000,,704,4.285714285714286

This one came up often, and for a good few years I never even attempted to try it out because from the cover it looked like some show about big-boobed women killing each other. Although that is maybe 20% true, when I finally gave it a shot about a week ago I was absolutely blown away.

The fighting scenes are great, but that is not the highlight of this show. This show has a very strong sense of drama and character development above anything else. There is some but not much comedy, which adds a nice touch. But what really makes this show stand out and be a close rival to my favorite anime of several years is the absolutely heart-breaking story and soul-destroying ending. It is most definitely arguable that it has a very happy ending, but at a cost.

This series decides to go off on its own and try to create its own mythos.  I'm not opposed to a different bearer than Sarah, I'm not opposed to the idea of clone blades, I am a little opposed to a weak character bearing the Witchblade, but what I can't condone is a series that totally misses the point of the base material.  The Witchblade is part of a carefully created universe that is full of the Angelus, the Darkness, the Magdelyna, and about ten other artifacts.  Its amazing to me that Mr. Marz ever green-lighted this project, but it appears he did.

Okay, my feelings about the general Top Cow universe being ignored aside, this is a watchable series.  This has some very creepy characters and real feeling of danger at some points.  Although, the conversations between the mother and daughter seem inane, as do most of the conversations.  I personally prefer character development over action and this tries to deliver on that, but it feels so poorly written and sometimes delivered even worse.

Everyone in this series seems to deliver their lines with almost no emotion at all.  When people die in these episodes its almost no big deal.  Everything about this series seems flat and uninspired.

3535006,5,B001DN0US0,"I love this series. Seriously. Now, here is the big thing, if you were a fan of the Top Cow comic book, this doesn't follow along. It is inspired by the comic and takes some of the aspects of the comic, but it's not the same. I know someone on here has already given a very detailed write up involving that so I am not going to double up on it... but I did want to point it out.

That being said, I really like what they did with it. I think the character development is excellent in this series. The action is great. The artwork is fantastic. The over all story line is well developed. My biggest complaint is that it is only 24 episodes. When this was over I was so disappointed that it was over. It really left me wanting more.

This show has everything IMO. It has the story of a struggling single mother and the love between her and her daughter, a guy with serious mommy issues, a brat with an attitude problem, greed and power, high tech military weaponry, political arguments, and boobs! If you are just looking for an Anime with fan service, this isn't really the one you want. If you want a series that has everything else I listed above, then this is a great pick! Don't get me wrong, when the girls transform they show a lot of skin, but this is not Elfen Lied or Dance in the Vampire Bund when it comes to showing nudity.

This anime made me very happy. It's got tons of action, comedy, and drama. It can be brutal and emotional, funny and tear jerking. It has lots of good characters and voice acting. The animation and special effects are both very good as well. I had the impression that this anime was about sex and probably didn't have much of a story. I was very surprised.

There's lots of violence, but I don't recall any sex or nudity (however, some of the costumes don't leave much to the imagination).  (I guess that makes it fit into the current insane U.S. culture where it's ok to show someone getting ripped to shreds, but by God there better not be a nipple slip while it's happening.)

3535030,5,B001DN0US0,"I agree with virtually everything Aion had to say in his excellent and thorough review. I picked up Witchblade nearly a year ago and forgot to watch it. I just watched the entire series over the last two weeks and I was very pleasantly surprised. The cover is a little misleading - this isn't a violent ""pervy"" series at all and apart from the large bosomed main character, there is virtually no sexual content in this series at all. We are presented with a story of a woman, doomed by fate, and her utter dedication to her daughter.
The story is a little predictable in places, but this isn't so important because the characters are very well fleshed out, engaging and likeable. Witchblade achieved, at least for me, the one thing all successful movies and TV shows aim to do or should aim to do, namely present us with characters we can identify with and care about. I found parts of Witchblade very moving indeed and, of course, there were light hearted fun moments, too. The episode at the beach did have a touch of fan service about it, but it gave the viewers a breather from the darker and more tragic undercurrents of the story.

The English dub is excellent and the English cast was excellent and the translations were fair and idiomatic. The Japanese cast was excellent, of course, too. Please watch the interviews with the Japanese cast! I found this one of the most entertaining aspects of this DVD. It was nice to see Nana Mizuki interviewed - I've long admired her singing and I have some of her albums - she was so alive and animated in the interview - she was adorable. I liked the funny and, indeed, cheeky questions the (Japanese) cast asked each other! I got the impression that the group of people who voiced the characters had an enormous amount of fun together.
Maybe watch the cast interviews before looking at the entire series? It won't spoil the show for you.

I'll watch Witchblade again some time. I enjoyed it, it was a nice journey.",1320969600,,1962,4.555240793201133

It is full of information and it gives the very special seed of life to the animation. There is enough of action and drama as well as comedy. I don't think there is too much of this or that. It is a balanced movie. But it's sad as well. Didn't know it would be that touching to watch it until the very end.

3535034,4,B001DN0US0,"Despite the description on Amazon and what the director said, this show isn't about sex, porno, or hentai.
In fact, from memory there wasn't one nude scene in the entire anime.  Keep in mind this anime is rated MA, so there are a ton of SUGGESTIVE parts of the show.

The first 3 episodes focuses mostly on the main character ""sexy"" side, after that she transforms less and less and battles/suggestive ones become rarer.  The show begins to focus more on family ties, friendships, relationships, and morales as a whole.  The second season of Witchblade completely drops the ""suggestive"" title song and replaces it with a song about family and friendships.  The show is still serious just it removes the ""suggestive"" element from the show as time goes on.

The story is average if you played Soul Calibur you pretty much know the story of WitchBlade.  However, the characters in this show are unbelievable.  Each one has a distinct back story that is meaningful and they each have a significant role in the show.

My advice is, if you want to watch the series and not see all the sexual or suggestive references skip the first (approximately) 5 episodes, then watch the rest of the series.  Suggestive sex may have worked to make this series popular in the beginning but the characters are the core reason why people continued to watch the series.",1309132800,,1346,4.738197424892704

The witchblade chooses it's host. A female that it likes, granting it powers to be weld against the forces of evil.
Then we have the technologically engineered cloneblades. Cloneblades are laboratory bred and supposedly were created to surpass the abilities of the witchblade.

The leading role Misane is a single mom on the run from child welfare and are thrown into the storyline via various chronology.

This anime offers plenty of humor at times on the borderline of just being plain silly, but also has a softer side that builds on the relationships of characters: Most notably the relationship of a mother and daughter.

I wanted to see more of Masane and her ""crew,"" more action, and MUCH less of the political/scientific perspective. Unfortunately every scene that didn't include either Masane, Rihoko, or Cho made my mind wander away from the show (and there are a lot)

3535050,5,B001DN0US0,"I heard about Witchblade for years and people comparing it to Claymore. I really liked Claymore but stayed away from Witchblade because lets face it with an anime character as hot as that I thought the last thing this would be is a serious Anime. All I can say is that I was wrong. I started to watch this but stopped. Then I picked it back up several months later to finally check it out. I was really surprised by this anime.

The first few episodes and the last few are really quite different, or at least by the time you get to the last episode you'll think of them differently. The anime is about a woman named Masane and her relationship with her daughter Rihoko. You pretty much through 24 episodes learn how much the mother cares about her daughter and just what she's willing to go through to look after her.

The dilemma of this all is that she has a trinket on her arm that turns her into that curvaceous vixen you see on the box cover. It's hard to tell how much of the Witchblade Masane is her true self from her normal self. Masane just seems like a wild girl to begin with and her daughter the one that keeps her in check. But just to input this idea here the other Witchblade users seem to retain their conscious self and their actions and mannerisms are the same as when they are not in witchblade form so to mean that just means that Masane is well... a freak(if you know what I mean heehee).

The problem with the Witchblade is that Masane doesn't want this power because she is afraid of it(and she has good reason to be). She is just an ordinary women who is trying to get by with her daughter and all of a sudden finds herself at the center of attention because of the charm on her wrist. This unfortunate device brings both good and bad fortune to Masane and her daughter.

Through the development of the story you'll find yourself not so focused on the G-string wearing Witchblade Masane and more concerned about the well being of her and her daughter.

I really can't say enough how much of a roller coaster of emotions this anime is. It's actually pretty sad and reminds me a lot of Solty Rei (funny, Carrie Savage voiced a main character in that too). Just like Solty Rei, Witchblade is really big on the development of character relationships. I don't think it be possible to get into this anime if your not able to feel for the plight of the main characters.

This is one of those anime's you watch when you'll want so much for there to be a happy ending but what happens you'll just have to sit back and watch it to find out for yourself. I'm still holding back tears after watching this anime.

I gave this anime a 5/5 because it really made me care about the characters and is a very enjoyable anime to watch. Quality was placed into this anime and it shows. I could actually see this being adapted into an actual movie (and no I don't mean like that T.V. show).

Great anime! Well worth buying. I wouldn't compare it to Claymore since that anime is more about loneliness and finding meaning in yourself and in life. Witchblade is more about family bonds and what you'll do out of love.",1296259200,,3118,4.3270547945205475

3535052,5,B001DN0US0,"Wow, this was the first anime series that I completed watching. Just wow. First, I want to point out that I found the MA rating disappointing and very misleading. MA?! Really?! There was no vaginal, nipple, or penal exposure, no gore content, no rape, no sodomy, etc. Infact there were no visible sex scenes in the film. The FCC would find much more ""objectionable"" material on network television with Family Guy (yea, I watch Family Guy, and no I'm not hating on it, I just wanted to point out there was no material in this film that many including the FCC can argue is adult-oriented). Clearly politics played some role in the rating it received. I kept hitting the play button with this movie and the primary reason for continuing to watch was that-I was still interested in Masane Amaha (aka ""Melanie"" the main character). She is for you all to discover. As for the film in general, this series had many of the elements that I prefer. There was an original story present (detailed by many here), there was an apparent explanation for every event that transpired in the film (not once in the 24 episodes viewed did I feel as though a circumstance either wasn't clearly explained or was concealed for the creators' convenience), and I didn't feel as though there was a constant and unyielding barrage of mayhem on my screen which would annoy just about anybody. Thankfully the ending was not predictable or clich; it was very touching and occurred how it should have. Here's what I'd advise-watch all 24. The story progresses at a much more rapid flow towards the last several episodes, that's not to say that the rest aren't worth your time (to be honest I missed the calm and tranquil episodes before things picked up towards the end). I was definitely invested in the characters, especially Masane and her love for her daughter Rihoko. Damned emotions.

3535064,1,B001DN0US0,"I thought more about Witchblade recently, and it's actually a lot worse than I initially thought.  So here's a review that's much better and harsher than my first.

I never read any of the Witchblade comics, so I'm judging this anime solely on its own merits.

I got interested in Witchblade about a month or two before Christmas of 2009 and decided it would be a good Christmas present for myself, so I ordered it and had some family members pay me back.  I was hooked into Witchblade by its pleasant imagery (I am a guy, after all) and with its many promises of it delivering a ""touching, grabbing story.""  However, much like Elfen Lied, I was swindled by a bunch of the gushing praise that was totally based in dishonesty (a common crime committed among mainstream anime fans).

""Sought by the greed of Men since the dawn of Humankind, but only bestowed upon the woman whose fate it forever scars - The Witchblade. Is it the Righteous Sword of God, of the Hand of the Devil Himself? Now a new bearer has been chosen and she must discover the answers for herself. As she stands on the brink of destiny, she is forced to seek the balance between ecstasy and ruin...
Masane Amaha is a woman on the fringe of society, bouncing rootless from town to town with her daughter, Rihoko. She struggles to build a life for her family, with no memory of the past and no clue as to what the future holds. But upon their arrival back in Tokyo forces conspire to separate parent from child, unleashing the fury of the Witchblade. The young mother will find herself conscripted into the service of the Doji Group and hunted down by the emissaries of the NSWF, all while seeking to balance the weight of this forced duality.""

-Taken from product description (too lazy to summarize plot myself)

CHARACTERS

The characters aren't done well, to put it lightly.  They're victims of bad writing, since there's so much time wasted on totally unimportant characters at the expense of everything else.  The main culprits of this would be Masane's apartment neighbors.  They have no importance to the story yet so much time is wasted on such characters like the inverted fortune teller Naomi, a guy who says and does nothing named Michael, and the perverted old guy who's a computer hacker.  It wouldn't be so bad if these characters weren't so bland.  Oh look, Naomi constantly fusses over the pronunciation of her name and can't run her business well because she can't talk to people.  How funny!!  Apparently, the creator of this anime said something in the booklet that came with the DVD along the lines that he wanted all the characters to be relate-able so that you can follow almost anyone in the anime.  Sorry, but I'd rather relate to only a handful of interesting characters than a large amount of dull ones.

Also, some characters seem to be fleshed out in pretty ridiculous fashions.  For one, I think the idea of making Rihoko (Masane's supposed daughter) perfect and mature silly since while I know this isn't supposed to be 100% realistic, making a six year-old girl function like a fully matured person makes Rihoko a pretty unbelievable character, which is a bad thing for something claiming to be a character drama (which is what Witchblade claims to be).  Development is pretty poorly done for some characters as well.  For one, Maria (the main antagonist) suddenly develops from a whiny infantile brat into a fully matured young woman without any gradual steps between those two stages.

PLOT-HOLES/LACK OF LOGIC

While plot-holes aren't that gigantic or abundant, they're big enough to lower the rating of the show.  Something that irritated me pretty badly is that one of the main focuses of this anime is of course, the Witchblade weapon.  However, the Witchblade itself isn't really elaborated upon that much.  Instead, we get the aforementioned redundant character interactions.

Also, the series starts off as Masane finding and killing cybernetic weapons called X-Cons.  Masane joins the Doji Group, which makes the X-Cons, and has serious objections to the X-Con program, but those objections fade away without any sort of reason.

COMEDIC FILLER

Like most popular yet poorly made anime titles, Witchblade has moments of pointless comedy thrown in solely to pad out the running length, ""lighten the mood,"" or add ""emotional variety,"" when it just degrades the quality of the show.  There's a part in Witchblade where Masane spends the whole day out with Rihoko and one of the things that they do is go to a public bathhouse to relax and what could have been a touching moment was killed by a moment of stupid risque humor when the perverted old guy tries to peek in on the two bathing.

There was an episode in the series that was Masane and her neighbors just going to the beach and while that was a really bad case of general filler by itself, it had some really bad attempts at being humorous.  The prime example of this would be when a bespectacled lady verbally chastises the perverted old guy for not knowing about Michael's supposed fame, complete with the abhorrent over-exaggerated facial features that belong on generic swill like Azumanga Daioh than a serious character drama.

Because of all the filler mentioned above, this wastes a lot of time for the important parts of the story, and this causes the end of this anime to become horribly rushed and unsatisfactory.  I absolutely hate it when anime titles do this.

MATURE CONTENT

Witchblade just barely gets a TV-MA rating for one or two moments of ultra-violence, but most of the content is barely risque, and there's blatant fan service given the Witchblade and Cloneblade designs.

ACTION SCENES

As shallow as this sounds, I was pretty disappointed by the lack of action scenes in this anime since it was after all, marketed as such.  The action scenes themselves are decent, though nothing special since they seem too short for their own good, though it was pretty neat to see several women in skimpy, exotic outfits slashing and beating the snot out of each other.

APPEARANCE

 The animation is decent, though the artwork is what really stands out since everything looks fabulous and if you're a straight male, the Witchblades and Cloneblades are pretty fine eye-candy.  Though I must object the hiring of the character designer for Love Hina to design the characters because imagine how great the Witch and Cloneblades would look if they were designed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, who makes some of the best-looking female characters in anime.  The use of colors in general was also very eye-catching and pleasing.

However, quality animation, artwork, and eye-candy alone don't make a good anime.

POTENTIALLY GOOD STUFF

There were some moments of squandered potential here.  I found the themes of ""being consumed by the dark side"" and the mother-daughter relationship pretty interesting and in the case of the latter, touching at times.  I did feel a little sad in some areas, particularly when Masane tells Rihoko to live with Reina Soho (her real mother), but realizes how much she misses her once she's gone, along with the moment towards the end when Masane converses with Rihoko about death and what will happen once she dies.  However, these feel like manipulative actions at the behest of the animators in an attempt to make you forget about the show's blatant shortcomings, and I'm not going to fall for it.

FINAL WORD

This is another bad anime that relies on emotional manipulation and some eye candy to ""wow"" the audience rather than coherent, logical storytelling, and these types of actions really infuriate me.

As someone who puts logic and proper story and character development before anything else, Witchblade really got on my nerves after thinking about it some more.

Shigurui:  Death Frenzy
Rin:  Daughters of Mnemosyne

-----

Before anything else, you need to understand the following: Witchblade is, first and foremost, a character-driven drama, rather than an action series. It has some fighting, yes, but the vast majority of the episodes are spent focusing on character development. Everything else comes a distant second. At first the suggestion is that it's going to be a The Devil Lady, 'monster of the week' type, but that isn't the case.

Whoever decided to market Witchblade as a violent, fan-service heavy title wasn't too bright. Likewise, the person who came up with the idea of taking the title of a popular American comic and then creating an entirely different story, with an all-new cast, didn't make the wisest of moves. By attempting to pass-off a slow-paced, heartfelt and very human drama as a generic action title with added boobs, all Gonzo achieved was getting the wrong type of viewers; pushing away the types who would appreciate a family drama about a mother loving her daughter with all her heart and being willing to do anything for her.

Judging the series based on the revealing Witchblade forms and boob sizes, it's hard not to expect an utterly tasteless anime. But you know what? Sex only occurs ONCE during the entire series, and NOTHING gets shown--the two involved kiss and then it's the morning after. That pretty much sums Witchblade up: there's a lot of cleavage but, that aside, Witchblade is surprisingly tasteful. In truth, there isn't even a huge amount of action once series gets past the introduction period.

:: Story :: 6/10

Six years prior to the start of Witchblade, Tokyo had been left devastated by a catastrophic earthquake. Two people were found alive at the ground zero of the quake: a 17-year-old woman (later named Masane; her having lost all of her pre-disaster memories) and a baby (Rihoko). Only the maternity diary held by the woman pointed towards them being related...

Once the series gets going, the two are heading back to Tokyo on the run; desperate to stay together and not be separated by the child welfare organization (created after the quake, to 'help' children). As jobless Masane struggles to keep Rihoko, she encounters the 'monster' responsible for a string of nasty murders, and that's when what had been sleeping within her for six years awakens--the power of the 'Witchblade'; something that has existed since the beginning of time, selecting its (female) hosts and forcing its hosts to give into their lust and destructive urges. Masane then gets caught between two organizations who seek the Witchblade, ending up working for one (Douji: a major weapons supplier) to support her life with Rihoko and hunted by the other (NSWF: in charge of the child welfare organization and with links to genetic research).

I'll be honest here: the story of Witchblade is full of anime silliness, ranging from fat men disguised as killer microwaves, genetic experiments, and women who use 'Cloneblades'--lesser, copied versions of the ever mysterious Witchblade. It's never explained why the weapons Masane hunts target random females, or why the Witchblade only selects women as 'hosts'... or what the Witchblade actually is. And I couldn't help but see most of the twists coming in advance; the writers actually intentionally spelling out how the series would end in order to impact on the viewers' feelings progressively rather than shock them.

While it does have a B-movie sort of entertainment factor in its favour, if I were to score Witchblade based only on its story, it wouldn't be very flattering... But this is where the negative ends because, like I've already pointed out at the start, the characters are where it's at. The story is no more than a means to an end; the backdrop for lots of excellent drama.

:: Characterization :: 9.5/10

Masane (nicknamed 'Melonie' because of her boob size!), the lead of the story, has nothing going for her apart from her six-year-old daughter, Rihoko. She isn't incredibly sharp, has no skills of note and, really, only has her love for her daughter. The child welfare organization try to separate them; Masane's ability to transform into a scantily-clad, sexulized version of herself (thanks to the mysterious Witchblade attached to her wrist) puts her in danger and powerful corporations involve her in their troubles, but, no matter what stands in her way, she fights to protect and give a better life to the one she loves the most.

Loud, simple-minded, direct type of characters tend to be hard to like and easy to hate, but Masane is very endearing. There are many simple things that made her into a likable character, such as when she went into a blind panic after learning that her daughter had been hurt; Masane ending up running out of her apartment barefoot. She's often called a primate by her 'boss', Takayama, because of how she acts without thinking and says what's on her mind, but that's what's so lovable about her: her honesty, maternal instincts and selflessness. It's little surprise that she eventually wins over even Takayama with her natural personality as the series progresses - she's just impossible to not like and respect.

The supporting cast backing up Masane aren't too shabby, either. Rihoko basically 'mothers' her own mother by shopping, cooking and caring for the more absent-minded Masane, and her being so mature at such a young age makes her have instant likability. Takayama plays the role of Masane's stern and somewhat awkward middle-aged boss, giving her orders to hunt down rogue 'weapons' for money, and it's his banter with her that provides much of the comic relief--the two later also becoming much closer; the writers doing a wonderful job of humanizing him and showing his softer, caring side as the series progresses. The rest of the cast are less developed and involved than the main three but all play important roles; the residents where Masane and Rihoko live, though never getting much time individually, are responsible for the 'family atmosphere' always being in the air during the more relaxing periods, for example.

:: Art / Animation + Sound:: 8.5/10

The first thing that made me think, 'Wow, Witchblade might not be so horrible, despite the title and fan-service!' was its opening. I watched/listened to the opening by chance, and as soon as I heard the fast-paced, exciting beat and saw the visuals that accompanied the music, which included a close-up of Masane's eye and a tear coming out of it, I just knew I had to watch it. The first opening is THAT good--even the 'GIVE ME YOUR XTC!!!' lyrics going with the show itself. Gonzo went on to regret changing it halfway through since they replaced the far less impressive second opening with the first for the final episode.

In terms of the overall art and animation, the best word to use when describing it is consistent. Why? Because Gonzo are known for running out of budget and forgetting to animate towards the end. That wasn't the case with Witchblade, though, since the final episode featured fluid animation; Gonzo not being reduced to showing movement through lines on the screen and actually showing the characters running. Aside from a few instances of laziness where there wasn't animation and a few stills were linked, it was great to watch. Even Japan's obsession with breast jiggling got attention throughout! And, though I can't say Masane's HUGE, could-suffocate-with-ease breasts appealed to me personally, overall the art did look pleasing.

As for the soundtrack, I have to say: it's excellent. One track that stands out is one used for action quite frequently; a track with an eerie edge and... a woman breathing in an 'erotic' manner in the background - the track having an action-oriented beat. I was ALWAYS pumped for the action - my attention focused - simply because of the music. Towards the end, I recall drums starting beating after what had been a nice 'family life' sort of episode, and I just knew some sweet action would be coming my way. If a soundtrack is good enough, it can make something great into something even greater, and that's the case with Witchblade.

:: Overall :: 9/10

Witchblade has its flaws: the story isn't anything special, Gonzo appeared to run out of ideas at the death and just ended it, and the near enough naked girl-on-girl battles might be off-putting for some. However, the good by far outweighs the bad, and the characterization is at such a level that, if you're anything like me, you won't give a toss. Once the introduction was over and time had been given for attachment to the characters to form, I was too engrossed in their struggles to concern myself with negative thoughts about a robotic monster with the head of a bug and the like.

To sum it all up: If you go into Witchblade expecting nothing, you might just get everything in return. It's always rewarding to find a gem, and in my eyes Witchblade is a gem that deserves to have more people look at it. Do yourself a favour and watch it!",1267401600,85,9180,4.87997432605905

The storyline provided a relatively good time, providing just enough intrigue to keep the viewer wanting to know what lied ahead for our heroine. Kudos to Funimation for the presentation. If there were anything lacking (in my estimation), I'd say it would have been the lack of supplemental material typically offered with boxed sets. If you're a fan of the series or you enjoy scenes with scantily clad women, dispatching a variety of villainous types, this would definitely be worth purchase or a rental. At $57.00, the set is a bit pricey. A quick search on Amazon could save the potential buyer nearly half off the list price (if you don't mind used goods).",1258848000,4,968,4.802395209580839
