2769418,4,B000NJFUP8,"As I watched this for the first time, I thought during the first 10-15 minutes or so, ""Why have I never heard of this movie before? This is gonna be cool!"" (no pun intended). But it wasn't. It was boring. It didn't make sense. But I watched it again the next night since it was still in the DVD player, & I was too lazy to get out of the recliner to change it. It made a little more sense second time around. I've since watched it at least eight times (laying in bed, watching the streaming version on Netflix at bedtime). It puts me to sleep without drugs. I think it's the music & the minimal/low-key dialogue that does it. Plus, I finally figured out what's going on & decided it's not a bad movie. I actually now love it - it's an acquired taste.",1296864000,12,750,4.1438356164383565
2769419,4,B000NJFUP8,"This is a work of art and, as such, is really for people who can appreciate art... particularly something that isn't obvious and hits you over the head explaining everything. That sounds a little elitist but, given the present sad state of education, the pandemic of ADD and such, there are a lot of well-meaning people who just can't appreciate anything subtle. This is nothing but subtle! You're not always going to be in the mood for this but it is well worth watching.",1292544000,11,472,4.630952380952381
2769420,2,B000NJFUP8,"Could this be Ishtar in the snow?  Altman, Newman, Anderssen, Gassman, with this line-up you expect great things; you get nothing.  Understanding the Altman is trying to create a decrepit post-apocalytical world that is covered with snow and ice and where food is running out as most species have been killed; if this movie was any slower you'ld have to run it in reverse.  In the first half hour we spend twenty-five minutes watching Newman walk through the snow.  The dialogue is so sparse that it's makes a Sylvester Stallone movie seem like a group of chatterboxes.

There's little else to say except this was a very large waste of money and talent to tell us that people can be cruel and love blood sport.  Suggestion, watch it at double speed so the agony only lasts half as long.  You will miss nothing.

2769421,1,B000NJFUP8,"A sci-fi flick starring Paul Newman? Gotta be good, how did I miss this in the theaters?

Fast forward to 1984. I'm on a temporary assignment in England. This turkey is on BBC at 2 AM. No VCR. Only choice is to stay up and watch it. I convince a bunch of friends to come over. I supply the beer and snacks. Half way through the movie, my friends threaten to beat me to death and walk out.

Now I know why I missed this in the theaters. It must have been pulled on the first day. Actually freezing to death would be more fun than watching these people do it.",1245542400,8,557,4.009009009009009
2769422,1,B000NJFUP8,"This may not be Paul Newman's worst performance but there's a strong likelihood that it may be the worst movie he's ever appeared in.  Regardless, this is probably director Robert Altman's worst film.  Newman tries but he's virtually stranded by the inert material he's given to work with.  The unsuspecting viewer is left trying to pinch themselves to draw blood just to survive this cinematic endurance test.  The film in a nutshell is a post-apocalyptic dystopian fantasy about a game of death involving alot of geriatric Euros spouting out meaningless philosophy about the meaning of life.  Who actually thought this stuff would be interesting?  Altman can blame the writers but be contributed to the script.  Of mild semi-interest is the art direction.  Pretty heady praise.  Don't even bother with this waste of celluloid.",1222905600,5,828,5.165413533834586
2769423,2,B000NJFUP8,"In 1970, Twentieth Century Fox released ""M*A*S*H,"" a huge box-office smash that put Elliott Gould on the map, and established Robert Altman, a veteran director of TV's ""Bonanza,"" as one of the important figures of 1970's cinema. Much like Gould, Altman quickly burned out, and there's hardly a spark of imagination to be found in ""Quintet.""

Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.

But ""Quintet"" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why ""maverick credentials"" are something to boast about.

2769424,3,B000NJFUP8,"When I first saw this film, late at night in the  seventies, I thought it was another strange drug reaction.  Set in a frozen future world, Paul Newman plays a game called ""Quintet,"" in which players attempt to kill each other off.  When one kills three, a fifth player, the quintet, unknown to any of the four, attempts to kill the survivor.  Good director, good cast, Bibi Anderson, best known at the time as Hugh Hefner's girlfriend, and a very strange story.  Too bad it's out of print.",1206489600,7,490,4.5227272727272725
2769435,2,B000NJFUP8,"It was hard to suspend disbelief watching this move. The idea of people killing each other out of boredom as part of a game is reasonable - Russia has had cases where someone commits murder because that's the last thing they could bet on, having run out of money. But the delivery of the story line falls flat, is boring and repetitive.",1410480000,,336,4.435483870967742
2769436,4,B000NJFUP8,"Anyone I ever meet who says they have seen Quintet always says the same things: Yawn, boring, cut it off after 20 minutes or half way through etc. This is sci-fi for hardcore fans, I mean hardcore not as in action but in 'willing suspension of disbelief', placing your self into the story and believing this could happen. Yes, it is slow and boring much of the time, but this is a unique type of film for Paul Newman which makes it all worth while. Set in Mankind's last ice-age Newman journeys back into the city with his preganant wife looking for work only to find the city in near ruins and slowly being over run with wild dogs who devour the dead within minutes. Everyone in the city is consumed by the strange boardgame 'Quintet', which is the only expression of life they seem to hold regard for. Against his will, due to cruel circumstances, he is drawn into a real game of life and death with ultimately no real purpose to continue except to play the game for the sake of playing. The end of the film is bleak, as one would expect in a dystopian film of this caliber, but Newman's character maintains his self identity and his ability to hope for the future. If you absolutely MUST skip over the bulk of the film, please watch the last 20 minutes. I hate to encourage this, but you simply must see the end of the film to appreciate the full scope of the work. In the face of desperation, starvation and extinction how would you choose to play or exit the life consuming game of Quintet?",1384300800,,1495,4.362007168458781
2769437,4,B000NJFUP8,"This is one of the weirder sci-fi films out of the 1970s (it is almost Zardoz-like in its strangeness). We are in the frozen future where New York City is a block of ice where the remaining people on Earth gather to survive, drink and play games. There is little hope left in the world for anything better. Essex adopts the identity of a Quintet player (Redstone) as he uncovers the scheme behind the game everyone is obsessed with. The other players start disappearing. Quintet is very cool and needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. Do not expect to learn much on your first viewing because little is seemingly explained but it is all there when you watch it again. Quintet does grow on you but it's not for everyone. English is not the native tongue of many performers in this international cast. The result is an interesting collection of performers who seem quite memorable (some would say out of place) delivering philosophical dialogue in parkas. There is a little bit of everything in this dystopian classic. I love the bombastic '70s score, the somber mood, the strange dialogue and the interesting characters. There are plenty of twists to keep you guessing and the ending is also wonderfully bleak like many classic '70s films.

What didn't work was the tube of vaseline on the corners of the screen in every sequence designed to make you feel ""part of the ice world"" in the movie. The fourth wall wasn't exactly broken. It works on some level but not on all levels. This one is an acquired taste and deserves a deluxe Blu-ray with 3 hours of bonus content. It is currently out of print on DVD. Quintet didn't connect with many audiences as it doesn't even have a cult following. You are warned that bringing beer, popcorn and snacks to this is pointless because it isn't a date, buddy or action film. It was filmed on location at the ""Man and His World"" exhibit in Montreal. Admittedly the set design is amazing and works well for the film. There is atmosphere galore here as you feel almost claustrophobic. I rented it during a snowstorm ten years ago and it made quite an impact. Some other films in the same vein include: Logan's Run, Solaris, Zardoz, Brazil, Blade Runner and many others. This DVD has managed to retain its value.",1378512000,6,2261,4.624378109452737
2769438,4,B000NJFUP8,"I had seen only the Robert Altman extravaganza type films before, where he manages large groups of people many celebrities throughout (like chess pieces).  Here Altman does it on a skilled small scale with only a few (also a noted cast, this time, and ironically, quintet pieces.) So it is interesting in that light.  It is well pulled together, interesting, visually appealing, though having a depressing feel that made me not want to see it through initially, but glad I did.  But what does one expect in a post-nuclear ice age with only limited survivors?  It boils down to acceptance of non-surviving in a bleak world without hope vs. hope, the dark and light in humanity (splashed with blood red), Altman stresses the dark.  But the end result of what one becomes and gets in life being colored in how one sees things.  Loved the faded out beginning and ending whited out scenes as humanity seemed to be snuffing out, but was hope just around the corner?  Was nice to see Paul Newman again in a healthy younger state.",1378166400,2,1022,4.675977653631285
2769439,5,B000NJFUP8,"I haven't seen Quintet since it was first released in 1979.  Of course, it was a different world then.  A future nuclear holocaust was practically a given looming over every day life in the Cold War.  But the scenario of this minimalist Altman film is as plausible in the face of global warming and species death, which threatens to roast half the planet we call home and to freeze the other half in a new ice age.  The acting and direction is suberb, and the digital quality of sound and picture in this DVD edition is excellent.",1377561600,2,530,4.43298969072165

2769443,5,B000NJFUP8,"Other reviewers here have lambasted this film for its pace, and I will admit that it takes its time, but that is what gives the film its insight.  I cannot put into words exactly what makes this such a great film, other than to say that the cinematography and sets are excellent.  ""Quintet"" is one of those films where understanding comes from emotion, which is all the more important here because many of the characters, Newman's central character included, are emotionally deficient. Again, some have seized upon this as an indicator of the film's inferior quality. Like the men and women in the space station in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" who were more robotic than human, these characters' lack of emotional reaction to events we cringe at is purposeful, and gives us a window into their lives. These are hardened, tragic figures. The only moment in the film where a character seems to be experiencing real, powerful emotions turns out to be a ruse, a fact that seals this film's five-star rating for me.",1359417600,7,1006,4.775862068965517
2769444,5,B000NJFUP8,"I saw this movie the week it came out at the multiplex and left completely totally stunned. I was convinced then it was the greatest movie I had ever seen. 40 years later, I still remember scenes and the strange hope this movie left me at a dark time in my life.

I don't want to see it again.

It may not be the greatest movie ever made and I'd hate to lose my memories.",1333756800,3,371,3.933333333333333
8178188,5,B000NJFUP8,"After many years a hunter of seals Essex (Paul Newman) comes home to the city. He beings his wife Vivia (Brigitte Fossey.) Before the greetings is over his extended family meats a violent ending. This is just the beginning for Essex as he must now make sense of this.

In the process we learn of a game ""Quintet"" that reflects the geometric universe and the sense of life.

Will he figure out the sense of the seemingly random disposal of life or will we finally get a glimpse of sixth space.

Keep your eye on the goose.

Appropriately filmed on location at ""Man and His World"", Montreal. The film has an out of focus border to give us not a dream scene as much as the feeling we are watching the whole movie through a frosty window.",1509148800,,734,4.335766423357664
8178189,3,B000NJFUP8,"A too stagey failure from Altman, but not the bomb some (Pauline Kael) accused it of being. It has affecting and effective moments, and Paul Newman creates a character quite unlike anything else he did. It's a story of death, the transitory nature of everything, so don't expect a lighthearted good time. How much poetry Altman brings to this sad notion is for you to decide. I got something from it.",1494288000,,400,4.647887323943662

8178191,1,B000NJFUP8,"Murky plot, murky cinematography, and at the end of the movie you wonder what the film is all about. That boredom would cause people to kill? If so the 200 people who ever watched this film from start to finish would all be behind bars. As I wrote in my review of Brewster McCloud, Robert Altman movies are an acquired taste and in most cases I don't care for his films. Altman's mode of storytelling isn't suited to Sci-Fi or post apocalyptic movies at all. Quintet is easily the worst Altman movie I've watched.",1475712000,,513,4.468085106382978
8178192,3,B000NJFUP8,"I liked the movie's premis, but the plot holes were big enough to drive a sno-cat through. Food, power for the lights, etc.",1466121600,,123,4.391304347826087

Dialogue - exposition, exposition, exposition. I read a review of this film that said it had no commercial ambitions whatsoever and that made me really interested in watching it. Unfortunately with this one, I feel as though Robert Altman had no ambitions in using the camera to any effective end. Looks like weird 70s television show - flat.",1430352000,2,516,4.619565217391305
