8233475,5,B000YMVDR8,"I am extremely pleased with the DVD, it is like bringing  Bali into my living room.  It is not a travelog, there are no words.  I have been to Bali twice and loved it more than anywhere on earth, and I was not disappointed in the dvd.  It is very slow and gentle, and shows the many sides of Bali with Balinese music as the soundtrack.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to escape the regular world and take a mini vacation.  I love it.",1203120000,6,444,4.045977011494253
