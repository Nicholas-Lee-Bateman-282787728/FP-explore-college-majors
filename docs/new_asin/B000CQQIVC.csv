8100665,5,B000CQQIVC,"Yes, this is a bittersweet performance, and a little too sentimental at times.  But Totie is fantastic and looks better in this DVD than she did for years before her surgery.

Its awesome to see the pre-show interviews with so many legendary performers, and really the only complaint I have is that her actual show is not long enough!

Despite her health issues, Totie's timing and double-takes are flawless.  She plays with the audience constantly and seems completely at home on stage.  Some of the jokes are clearly not funny (and many times she tells the audience that they aren't), but I'm just thankful that this DVD preserves her brash voice and personality, and her delivery and timing!

Its a shame that there aren't more DVDs of her, but I'm thankful at least for this!",1265328000,5,779,4.733333333333333

8100667,2,B000CQQIVC,"How I wish they could have found an earlier performance to put on DVD. I love Totie Fields and think she was one of the best female comics of all time, but the HBO special made of her triumphant return to the stage after losing her leg is not very funny. Oh do not get me wrong there are some great lines but overall this is a more sentimental performance. The special is really a thank you card to her friends, family and fans but what is to be a happy hello becomes a goodbye as she did not live much longer after this performance. I can only hope that there is more material out there to be released to highlight her comedic brilliance.",1162857600,7,639,4.161290322580645
8100668,3,B000CQQIVC,"I wish there were more recorded performances of this brilliantly funny lady.  I did purchase this DVD, and enjoyed seeing Totie perform again.  However,  the material wasn't that funny.  To me at least.  I know she incorporated her health issues in her monologues,  but this particular performance just made me feel.....sad.  Maybe one day someone will discover lost videos of Totie.  She deserves to be remembered,  but not like this.",1159228800,11,435,5.1
