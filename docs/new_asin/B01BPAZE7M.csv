7665016,5,B01BPAZE7M,"Again the warning: this is not playable in the United States for those who do not have an all-region machine. Another successful  adaptation of a LeCarre story to screen and/or television, this by BBC, in which one brave loner is the appointed agent to try to take-down a vicious international
criminal and his organization by  boring from within. Excellent performances highlight this struggle of Good versus Evil, with many kudos as well to the  writer who adapted the original text and the Director who brought out the best in the cast. Settings are international and the women beautiful.....so too,  I imagine is the male lead although being of the same sex  I have to leave that to the female reviewers. The only problem that I had with the production was that it is so intriguing as to make it quite difficult to stop the procession from one episode to the next in order to eat, sleep or do any of the other household chores which draw one away from the television. While there are certainly scenes showing violence and the product of violence, the tension is mostly produced by the fear of exposure of the Good Guy stuck among the Evil Ones.",1460592000,20,1148,4.663366336633663
7665017,5,B01BPAZE7M,"US fans of UK TV material, you are in for a real treat with this new BBC TV series, which ended here last Sunday. Based on a book by John Le Care'---which I confess I have not read , but, The bulk of opinion in the UK Amazon Reviews --and media Critics--is overwhelmingly positive. It is one of those Crime/ Spy type thrillers that leaves you on the edge of your seat, and longing for the next episode; Of which there are 6. The cast is excellent--Tom Hiddleston ( our hero) Olivia Colman, Hugh Laurie, Tom Hollander etc etc.--wonderful  film locations in the mediterranean. It has been likened to a Bond Film--and Hiddleston , as a new Bond  prospect. As stated by Amazon--this is a REGION 2--offering only--so unless you have a region-free player, I am convinced that a REGION 1 copy will be issued very soon--so confident am I, of the success of this new series. Enjoy--when you can.  P G Croft  UK.",1459296000,30,902,4.4817073170731705

7665025,5,B01BPAZE7M,"All I am going to say about BBC's television miniseries THE NIGHT MANAGER is

The Night Manager is a British-American television miniseries directed by Susanne Bier and starring Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, Olivia Colman, David Harewood, Tom Hollander and Elizabeth Debicki. It is based on the 1993 novel of the same name by John le Carr and adapted by David Farr to the present day. The six-part serial began broadcasting on BBC One on 21 February 2016. In the United States, it began on 19 April 2016 on AMC.  (From Wikipedia)

EXCEPT....
I love John le Carr's stories.
It doesn't need subtitles.
It'll win some Golden Globes.
Comcast doesn't have Episode 5 ON DEMAND. I'm placing a call to them next week.
AND....
Best miniseries ever.  Perfect cast.  Must have this dvd.

7665026,5,B01BPAZE7M,"I am a fan of shows/movies with excellent cinematography. I feel that when viewing a movie or series, the way a particular scene is shot and the location of where the scene is being shot, only adds to its effectiveness.
  Fortunately for The Night Manager, it not only has some really gorgeous scenery, but it also displays some unexpectedly innovative performances from its lead stars.
 I have not only come to admire Tom Hiddleston for his portrayal of Loki in the Marvel movies, but I fully respect his ability as an actor; as such he proves here  that his character Jonathan Pine is quite the force to be reckoned with. I must add too, that, I personally believe he would make a fine James Bond.
His co-stars performances are very much effective here too; with actor Hugh Laurie taking on the villainous role of Richard Roper. And he is absolutely fantastic to watch here; as is his lovely co-star Elizabeth Debicki. Each performance in The Night Manager feels effective.
There are some action scenes; (some really well timed scenes too I might add), but beyond that I feel the story never ceases to get better. Between the 3rd episode and the 4th episode, there is a slight decrease in the pacing, but even then its still such a joy to watch that it didn't affect my interest in the series.

All in all, I do feel The Night Manager is a compelling series to watch. Mind you, 6 episodes isn't an especially lengthy series, but I will confess The Night Manager does what it should, and it certainly does not disappoint.",1466380800,5,1522,4.601476014760148

The tension between thoughtful screenwriting and Action-Jackson sequences embody the spirit of the John le Carr novels.
