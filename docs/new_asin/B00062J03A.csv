2161912,5,B00062J03A,"David Icke's Matrix is the first concept on reality I've seen that makes any sense is this crazy world. Those human beings who choose not to accept this concept of reality are living an ILLUSION and they have been completely taken over by the ""ILLUMINATI AGENDA."" Mr. Icke presents the material in a down to earth fashion that anyone can grasp, that is if he or she has a mind that's not consumed by previous programming from childhood. In essence! We are what we THINK! FEEL! and SEE!

I truly wish humanity would break out of their self contained negative mold and see for themselves that REALITY IS WHAT WE MAKE IT! If you have any conscious you'll reccommend the Matrix to your friends, family and loved one's before it's too late.

THE MATRIX IS A MUST SEE TO BELIEVE!

That's what I'm doing.

2161913,1,B00062J03A,"For all the lemmings who follow Mr Dicke's work, here is your chance to see this lying cretin in action.  Babbling away like a raving looney in desperate need of a valium shot, Dicke covers every facet of paranoia, ranging from Willy Clintons phallus problems to Bob George's oustanding IQ!.  All the while, we are subjected to first grade shonky camera work with 1hr+ of actual footage missing!

Recommended for Dicke tragics and basket cases with no life.",1125100800,15,457,4.833333333333333
2161914,4,B00062J03A,"Beware the reviewer JD who has taken a considerable amount of time to discredit all of David Icke's work and probably gets paid to do so. Note with these hate filled people they only say ""david a nutcase"" but never given a reason WHY any of his theories don't make sense or are nonsense. I'm open to any comments from both sides but if you only aim to give childish insults then go to hell, I'd like them to give specific examples of why David's work is looney alongside their own theory of what happened, no surprise this never happens. Regardless of what the above moron has said or what I've just said all I can say is GET IT AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF!!!!!

I've read a lot of david books and this lecture is a good live presentation of what his books discuss. I don't agree on everything he says, but it is certainly interesting and thought provoking. On a technical note, more than one camera angle would have been better but overall it is a good presentation and worth the money.",1117670400,14,983,4.371584699453552
2161915,5,B00062J03A,"I stumbled upon David's Books many years ago, but never read any and always by-passed them because I didn't care about reading about any conspiracy theories and I thought that's all that his stuff was about.  It's not.

Ultimately it is not about those people out there, reptilians or not, it's about you and your mind, it's about taking control of your mind and about taking control of your life.

The DVDs are also about becoming aware of your connection with Infinite Loving Wisdom within you, and about not taking any stories that are served for granted, but rather asking questions about ""truths"" that are served and that people just take for granted.  The DVDs are about giving yourself permission to think for yourself, to express your uniqueness, to express your creative potential, to listen to that little voice within that whispers ""I CAN"".

The last CD has about 2 hours of information on hypnosis, how the brain processes information and how we get subliminally influenced.  As a hypnotist myself, I can attent to the fact that your awareness of manipulative methods used - not only in forms mentioned on these DVDs, but also in a form what we call ""hypnotic language"" patterns or covert hypnosis - reduces the ability of another to use these methods on you, because you consciously catch them.",1116288000,33,1307,4.838565022421525
2161916,5,B00062J03A,"Man, the first thing I noticed was the audience is huge and David's gained a bit of weight.  The message comes thru loud and clear though - as always.  David is articulate and convincing.  He has truly opened my mind to all sorts of new possibilities.  Highly recommended for those wanting to expand their understanding of how the universe works, how our political system doesn't work, etc.  Worth the $$$...  Take a dive into the world of Icke - the water is wonderful...",1105056000,27,472,4.626506024096385
8037282,2,B00062J03A,"not really sure how this thing rates 5 stars overall, especially considering how 75% are 5 stars and the rest are less. math tells me this cannot be possible.

this was pretty hard to watch. if you start to watch and agree right away, then it may be easier. but if you come in and try to see where he's coming from, it's difficult to get past the ancient memes presented. amazon listed this as a 2017 release, but all the jokes were passed around the internet in 2005. ok, we get it...you hate bush. after hearing the same joke a million times, it just gets old.

it probably isn't from 2017, which should also be obvious from the video quality. but even from the dated standpoint, it's like when your friend sends you the forwarded email that you read 10 years ago. not only is it just the same joke over and over, but it just shows up randomly. it doesn't go away. you snickered the first time, almost smiled the second time, and now someone thinks it's the best thing EVAR

if david icke wants me to ""open my mind,"" then he should probably do more than produce his ""research"" that took so many years, but yet everyone has been talking about it for years like it was so obvious. research usually produces something new. and of course if you don't think like he does, then you're the one that has the ""baa-baa mentality."" do i detect irony?

if he got into some other, more interesting stuff, then it's a shame that it was such a turnoff in the first 24 minutes",1503100800,,1462,4.324817518248175

8037287,5,B00062J03A,I'm not going to get in a long winded articule here but I will relate a bit of info about this set.  Basically all the things you have been told about the pyramid on the back of the dollar the statue of liberty the statue on top of the white house and alot of other unusual and seemingly strange symbols proliferating our modern society are not innocent greek mythology symbolism of freedom as were have been told.  But are actually the work of a secret society that harks back to the days of old that behind the scene have been forever controlling our destiny and controlling our minds.  These society's are active today and are running our governments and our world banking institutions.  Steeped in symbolism and occult rituals these organizations have upsurped our power over our own destinys and are basically writing their own chapters in our lives.  I won't go on here but if your dissatisfied with the way you view life and war and politics in general then you really should consider the investment of one of these videos and discern the truth for yourself...but be warned once outside the box of the matrix your life will never be the same...you have been warned..:),1201219200,9,1175,4.657004830917875
8037288,4,B00062J03A,"Join David Icke (pronounced: I- KEY) on this 3 disc 360 minute journey through the illusory matrix commonly referred to as physical reality. If you're unfamiliar with the bizarre, highly unorthodox world of Mr. Icke where nothing is what is appears to be it's time to sit down, get comfortable and open your chakras as you prepare to ""follow the information"" trail with David and see where it eventually leads.

Disc 1 & 2 investigates our socio-economic-political climate as we rapidly move towards a unified, one world government:

- Learn how reverse symbolism, subliminal programming and encoded mantras like ""weapons of mass destruction"" are used to polarize our subconscious into hostile factions making it easier for the `Powers That Be' to manipulate the populace headlong into war like lambs to the slaughter.
- Discover the existence and machinations of an age old secret society, the Illuminati, working behind the scenes of every national government and major corporations to control the hearts and minds of unsuspecting civilians. Learn to discern the signs, symbols and rituals by which this organization can be recognized.

Disc 3, Ah..., this is where the scenarios presented will really begin to challenge your most treasured paradigms. Cast all your pre-conceptions aside if you dare and imagine a world of alternate possibilities. What if these corrupt world leaders identified in the first two parts of the presentation are only the front men or puppets for a powerful race of non-human beings. Are inter-dimensional shape-shifting, reptilians moving in and out of our holographic reality and leading us to a totalitarian future beyond our wildest nightmares? If so is there something we can do to stop them? According to Icke there is.

As David Ickes' deprogramming session comes to an end wait patiently until the wave patterns swirling around you reassert themselves into recognizable forms and your molecular structure reassembles before attempting to move about. Take a deep breath and relax. Do you feel safer now that you're safely back inside the hologram? Will you go out into the sunshine and embrace consensus reality as you did before? Or will you feel like something has changed, as though things are somehow different than you remember? If you experience the latter, welcome to the universe of David Icke.",1200441600,22,2340,5.19893899204244
8037289,5,B00062J03A,"David is energetic and personable, it's hard not to like him.  He has put together a powerful, well researched presentation and there's never a dull moment.  It was riveting enough to sit through the whole six hours the first time I watched.  I've watched it twice again and keep seeing things I missed before.  There is a lot of information here and it will get the old brain cells fired up.  (Things that make you go, 'hmmmm'.)  The first two parts he talks about the state of the world today, then goes into history.  As he talks there are continuous graphics behind him that show what he's talking about.  As he goes along, he weaves together information in a very compelling way that is both powerful and amusing.  He talks about Sept 11th, about the US Gov't, and yes, about reptiles.  The last two hours were hard for me at first, I wasn't ready to go along with him after he'd gotten me so interested with facts and brilliant analysis.  I forced myself to just sit and listen and I'm glad I did, it wasn't too weird for too long.  I think of this DVD like a grand buffet table with hundreds of plates of delectable goodies, and some plates I'd rather not partake of.  Just because a few items offered don't appeal to me doesn't mean I have to toss the whole thing out.  There is definitely something worth experiencing here for people who are self thinkers as opposed to cookie cutter sameness addicts. I like his energy and intelligence, and hope to see more of him on DVD in the future.",1143417600,23,1496,4.4322344322344325
8037290,5,B00062J03A,"From over 30 years of personal research into these issues, this is the most well developed and spoken account of the real nature of politics and control of the public mind. Noam Chomsky and others have spoken about the political agendas of the United States, and the corporate control of the media and such topics, but to my knowledge, Icke is the first person to describe the secret societies and their history, going way back to the beginning.

The sad part is that this information is distinct from what we learned in public schools and what we see and read from the various media outlets. It would be easy to verify most of what Icke says by simply researching on your own.

An open mind is a good thing. If you have an open mind, then this film will actually explain how the world really works. Peace and good luck to you on your quest for knowledge.",1133136000,7,855,4.439490445859873
8037291,5,B00062J03A,"I'm not sure I agree with the use of his humor in this work which I honestly did find humorous but I can say I didn't find it appropriate dealing with this subject matter giving his audience (the general public).

I personally think he gives to much credit to the powers that be.  Frightening, he should put these ideas on DVD to give people in power even more ideas to act upon.  Most of his work has a good deal of merit although I do think he gets a little deep into things which are still theoretical, but all and all I think it should be required material for those still able to use there minds.

  Even if it doesn't prove a thing at least it might wake a few people up to the possibility that their lovely image of the world isn't as it appears, or at least gives them the initiative to think on there own.",1130889600,2,814,4.120253164556962
