3517225,5,B001CR49HA,I thought all did a great job! Would highly recommend this movie! Robert Hayes did a great job of portraying Mister Robert's. Henry Fonda would be proud.,1374105600,4,153,4.703703703703703
3517226,5,B001CR49HA,Saw this live on TV when I was younger and I believe that this is better than the Hollywood movie version,1372377600,4,105,4.0476190476190474
3517227,5,B001CR49HA,"Kevin Bacon as Ens. Pulver steals the show in this wonderful performance of the play, which was based on a novel. If you are a fan of the 1955 film (which is also very good and follows the play's script pretty closely), I think you'll enjoy this version a lot.",1369612800,3,260,4.22
3517228,1,B001CR49HA,"Amazon instant video describes it as the 1955 movie with James Cagney & Henry Fonda. After you purchase it you find out it is some ""play"" from 1984. Total ripoff! I've only used this instant video about 5 times & this is the second time Amazon misrepresented the product 100%. It's not even a case of you need reading carefully, they don't let you in on the ripoff until after you purchase the download. I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL OF AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO!",1363478400,3,452,4.457831325301205
3517229,5,B001CR49HA,"""Mister Roberts"" is available as a movie, a book, and as this DVD which uses the Broadway script.  It is a story all will enjoy, so which do you buy? I recommend this one.

It is enjoyable, for a change, to see a story played out before a live audience, with the skill of actors rather than film mechanics making the difference. The 1955 film, like this newer version, is complete with a STAR-STUDDED cast. The '55 cast stars Henry Fonda. If it's the older film version desired, perhaps just a few dollars more will get you the 4-movie set of Fonda which includes ""Mister Roberts.""

This ""Mister Roberts"" production includes a more contemporary cast. It was first aired in 1984.  The lone female role, the blond, sexy, nurse, Ann Gerard, nicknamed ""Red Label"",is played by Marilou Henner (Taxi, 1978-83). Lt. Doug Roberts (Robert Hays- of Airplane) is cargo officer on a navy cargo ship but wishing he was seeing more military action just as the WWII front in Europe is about to come to a victorious end.  Captain Morton (Charles Durning), refuses to help him leave the ship for another duty. The association with Ensign Frank Pulver (Kevin Bacon, Animal House funny) and Doc (Howard Hesseman-WCRP in Cincinnati)provides many humorous moments within the story of Mr. Roberts' escape to the war front.

The TV aired theatre performance version is delightful evening entertainment. It's like having the expensive front row seats.

A sequel to ""Mister Roberts"", ""Ensign Pulver"", 1964, is also available with Robert Walker Jr. becoming Pulver, Burl Ives the Captain, and Walter Matthau, Jack Nicholson, and Larry Hagman added for the other main roles.  Let us hope it is soon to be a DVD also.",1224633600,9,1689,4.860627177700349

8288924,5,B001CR49HA,"All the bad reviews are based on the purchaser not being aware of this fact.
This is easily the best performance Howard Hesseman ever gave, and possibly Kevin Bacon's best.",1482105600,2,172,4.766666666666667
8288925,5,B001CR49HA,"This is, probably, NOT the version you remember seeing.
BECAUSE SO MANY REVIEWERS 'leaped before they looked',
I'll forgo a review with a ""cut 'n' paste"" for the uneducated-viewer.

8288928,5,B001CR49HA,Great tribute to the old Playhouse 90 days of live television.  A bit stiff on the production...I would have liked to see more grit and rust everywhere.  Too neat and clean.  And a slight but of rolling on the seas---camera movement would have accomplished that. But the acting was terrific!  Good job!,1439942400,2,302,4.75
