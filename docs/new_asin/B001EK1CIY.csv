 Well, first off, the hot Tomb Raider style chick on the covers (why I even looked at this set) has NOTHING to do with the movies.  You really can't tell a book (movie) by it's cover.
These are no more than an excuse for soft porn bits surrounded by mostly not very good stories and marginal acting.  The movies share only the title but none of the actors.
I'd rather find out who the cover model is!
Might be OK if you find it cheap enough. Waste of money otherwise. I wish I could give it less than one star.
