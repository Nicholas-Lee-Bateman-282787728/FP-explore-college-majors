6821684,5,B00PTUB352,Love The Anime But Now English Dub,1426118400,5,34,4.0
6821685,1,B00PTUB352,"Sentai, why didn't you dub the other 3 seasons?! Funimation didn't have Shakugan No Shana sub-only when IT released the last 2 seasons on home video after the first season was released by Geneon before it shut down. Why didn't you just have FoZ Seasons 2-4 dubbed in house at Seraphim Digital Studios?! Fans were waiting for the other seasons to be released since the first one was dubbed!

I'm sorry, Sentai, but, until you change your mind on this and do a dubbed re-release (like what you did with Maria Holic and Special A), I'm not buying the other seasons, nor will I order them for my public library!",1423180800,7,607,4.5181818181818185
6821686,4,B00PTUB352,"first off I'm glad to see that the second season is getting released in the US, the only down side is that it is not dubbed in English, so i would love it if it can be re-released with an English dub, because as I've said before i would buy all four seasons if they were all dubbed in English, so let's hope and pray that season 2 will get an English dub and that seasons 3 and 4 will be dubbed in English as well",1422316800,14,413,3.813953488372093
6821687,4,B00PTUB352,Great show ! Please dub!!!!!please! Could've been a five star if dubbed !,1422316800,7,73,4.6923076923076925
6821688,5,B00PTUB352,"Hope they decide to make the dub version, it's definitely worth it for such a great anime!",1422057600,8,90,4.352941176470588
6821689,4,B00PTUB352,Want it in dub so badly but got it and it just to funny not to watch,1421798400,2,68,3.0588235294117645
6821690,5,B00PTUB352,it's nice that season 2 is finally getting released its a sham It not dub though but still nice none the less,1421107200,10,109,4.0
6821691,5,B00PTUB352,"This series continues to develop the love between Saito and Louise, however Saito's love of big boobs ends up with him getting taken to the wood shed on more than one occasion. There is one episode that makes the whole series worth watching as Louise finally can say that she loves him. It has a lot of slap stick fun as well as some bittersweet moments. I'm looking forward to the next set of episodes to flesh out some of the brief exposure to certain characters and how they will interrelate at a later date. All in all this is a lot of fun to watch. Problem is that at times you feel for each of the girls that love Saito cheering them on even though you know deep down Louise has his heart.",1429833600,2,695,4.1940298507462686
6821692,5,B00PTUB352,Great anime cant wait to get the rest of the series,1429747200,,51,3.727272727272727
6821693,1,B00PTUB352,Will not be getting any more seasons until they stop being lazy and release a dub with all original actors..,1429660800,6,108,4.45
6821694,3,B00PTUB352,"I was very glad to see that Sentia Filmworks has decided to release the later seasons of this series. I was almost as equally disappointed to find out that there are absolutely no plans to dub these later seasons. I really do not watch very much in the way of subbed anime, but even if I did I would not be very happy with the voice acting on this season. I do not know if I would feel the same about the first season, because I only watched that season in dubbed version. The Japanese voice actor for Hiraga Saito was out of range to me, he sounded to old for a school kid, and that just threw everything off. If anyone is reading this and feels like I do please contact Sentai Filmworks and lets let them know there is money to be made by releasing the dubbed version.

6821698,3,B00PTUB352,I don't know why Sentia isn't releasing the dub when Gonzo already released the dub version years ago before they went under. Subs only? seriously?,1426636800,10,147,4.92

8689182,5,B00PTUB352,one of my favorite shows,1525305600,,24,4.0
8689183,5,B00PTUB352,"The core of this series has been done a thousand times, but it's still incredibly enjoyable... There are plenty of other reviews and synopsis that go into more detail than I could properly articulate, so I'll leave you to look into that elsewhere.

What I can tell you is that no, it isn't dubbed - subtitles only. I didn't find this to be a problem, though. I'm perfectly content with Kugimiya-sama...
The subtitles are done well, and there aren't any grammatical errors anywhere. (At least that I could see in my initial viewing)
You can't turn off the subtitles either, so that might be a negative to some who may not need them.

The disc menu is very simply laid out and it supports bookmarking, so you can pick up where you left off if you're interrupted in the middle of an episode.

Note about bookmarking: From what I noticed, if you do start an episode from the middle, the subtitles don't pick up immediately. It takes a sentence or two before they sync back up with the show. I've never seen this happen before, so I don't know if that's a normal occurrence. It wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Bottom line:
If you enjoyed the first season, there's no reason not to pick this one up, along with the others.
The quality is great and the price was fair.
Well done, Sentai Filmworks",1487030400,,1288,4.468085106382978

8689186,5,B00PTUB352,Loved the first season and I now can watch the rest. even if it's not dubbed I just rewatched the first season dubbed as to get back into it. better than spending 200 dollars on a Japanese import,1465516800,,195,4.157894736842105
