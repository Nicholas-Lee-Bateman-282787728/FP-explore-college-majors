8426654,5,B004EBT87C,"I purchased this video to learn more about EFT, specifically for the heart area, both physical and emotional.  I am very pleased with the video.  The actual video is filmed like you are actually at a conference, and has a 'live' feeling to it.  There is not a very sophisticated menu, but that is how the format is.  I found the presenter to be very calming and knowledgable in this area.  During the first two watchings, I actually had fallen asleep while doing the tapping workouts. I think that is what I must have needed.
I have found EFT to be life changing in the most wonderful ways, and add this video to the list of great blessings that have come into my life.  I highly recommend this for anyone who needs some kindness and TLC in their lives.",1368403200,3,753,4.381294964028777
