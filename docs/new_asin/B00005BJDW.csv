1424148,5,B00005BJDW,"As a huge fan of the X-Books, I have to say I was more than a little disappointed with the first X-Movie. Almost sixty years of character development and complicated plots can't be squashed into such a short film, I thought, and I was right. I thought the first X-Movie, while very nicely produced & directed, lacked the appeal that has made the comic-book characters such an unassailable insstitution for over half a century.
When I saw the second movie, I was happily blown away by the sheer OTT spectacle of it all - longer, more comlicated and better fleshed-out than the first - we now see more depth to characters like Mystique and professor X - and the plotline benefits hugely from some nice detail. It's a nice touch to see so many complicated comicbook storylines tie into one here - The X-Men and magneto uniting against Stryker to fight a common battle - and Sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart do wonderful things with their characters. Excellent performances too from Famke Janssen as jean Grey and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique - a character whose potential for coolness was severely overlooked in the first movie gets some wonderful sequences in this remarkable sequel.
The visuals are truly amazing, too. From the first scene starring Nightcrawler to Wolverine's beautifully-choreographed battle with Deathstrike, the whole movie sparkles like the Hope Diamond on speed.
On the whole this X2 box-set is a great idea, and a nice touch for people who, like me, weren't impressed enough with the first movie to actually go and buy it. The special features for both movies are excellent, some of the best I've ever seen, and I'm happy to say that I can recommend this thoroughly.",1071273600,3,1697,4.855172413793103
1424149,5,B00005BJDW,"I enjoyed the story line.  I was not bored for an instant.  I thought they did a  good job on character development.  Many movies portray people as all good or all bad.  Here, I saw the ""good"" people do things I don't like, and the ""bad""  people doing admirable deeds.  Then there were the characters who were afraid, doing  what they could to protect their way of life.  Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian  McKellen, and Halle Berry were perfect for their roles (as in the first movie).  I think the movie makes much more sense if you've  seen X-Men 1.  In fact, it had been so long since I'd seen the first movie that  I should have watched it again first.  I highly recommend X-Men United (X2)to anyone who enjoyed X-Men.  This is an unusually good sequel.
I thought the visual quality could have been a little clearer.  However, the DTS sound blew me away. (I watched a couple scenes in Dolby Digital 5.1.  That was also awesome!)  There was a chase scene where the sound... but I don't  want to spoil it for anyone!
Although X-Men (1.5) is included in this box set, this review is only for the new  material, X-Men United (X2).  People have a good point when they say that Fox has  done us dirty by having so many releases.  The price is right on this one though, only a few dollars more than X-Men2 alone.  Great price for four discs,  I've paid this much for two discs before.",1070496000,5,1383,4.367588932806324
1424150,4,B00005BJDW,"Ok, truth be told, I haven't yet seen X-2.  I LOVED X-men, and hadn't yet purchased it, and considered picking up this sweet deal on the bundle.  HOWEVER... WHY does Amazon charge $27.99 for the Widescreen format, and $35.99 for the Fullscreen format?  The original price is the same for either, but the sale prices show an $8.00 difference?  I prefer the Fullscreen.. IMO, widescreen is awful, and would never purchase it if given a choice.  This is completely not fair in their pricing to charge more for the same item, just because I'd prefer to have it in fullscreen.  I may have to reconsider purchasing this thru Amazon.",1070236800,6,626,4.697247706422019
1424151,5,B00005BJDW,Both of these movies are great.  I'm getting a hint of X3:  Pheonix Rising.,1069804800,,75,4.285714285714286
1424152,5,B00005BJDW,"This movie franchise does a great if somewhat flawed job at adapting the storyline and the themes of Stan Lee's X-Men comic book series to the movie screens yet stays faithful to the comics.
The first X-men movie released in 2000 is a fabulous first outing with excellent directing from Brian Singer. The movie's theme is of the clashing of two extreme opposite prejudices. The first is of rising anti-mutant hysteria sweeping the planet and skyrocketing support for mutant registration acts headed by Senator Robert Kelly. On the other extreme, anti-human sentiment is running rampant in parts of the mutant world and the head of the extremist movement of the mutant society is headed by the magnificent villain Magneto who aims to destroy humanity and leave the world in control of mutants. Between these extremes though is a mutant organization called the X-Men headed by Professor Charles Xavier whose goal is to fight justice and be able to bridge the widening gap and bring peace between the two increasingly hostile society. Magneto plans to wipe out humanity in NYC by means of a special machine that draws it's energy from a victim and releases a force field that turns human body cells into water molecules. This one has it's share of flaws. Rogue and Storm are the main problems, being just mere background characters with only a small amount of the awesome charisma of the comic book counterparts. Wolverine though was awesome and Hugh Jackman was perfect for the role of playing this awesome character. The best of the acting performances though were Patrick Stewert as Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen as Magneto. These two actors really brought these friends yet enemies at the same time characters to life better than any other comic movie I've seen in many years. Fabulous first movie! If course there's also the now fabled paint costume of the morphing mutant Mystique played by Rebecca Romijn Stamos. Interesting camera angles I must say.
The second X-Men movie though blows the first one right into orbit around the Earth. This dynamite sequel takes what was great about the first one and builds upon the greatness of that one and expands the storyline and scope of the X-Men universe. In this one, after the events of the first one, the anti-mutant organizations now decide to take even greater measures against the 'threat' and a vicious and dangerous rogue military general named William Stryker(Brian Cox) plans a massive strike against mutants. He also uses a special drug taht forces his subjects to tell what he or she knows about and uses it on Magneto. Strykers forces launch an assault on X-Men's home school for the Gifted. Meanwhile Magneto escapes from his plastic prison. Now with a common enemy, the X-Men and their archenemy Magneto's mutant organizaiton called the brotherhood of Mutants stop battling each other and join forces to defeat Stryker and stop his evil anti-mutant genocidal plans. New characters come into the picture such as Nightcrawler and Pyro and the action scenes are awesome. To put it this way ""X-Men United"" is as opposite to a sequel slump as you can almost go.
 This box set covers the first two movies and they are both great but the second one is especially awesome and what's really pwerful about both of these movies is that they really bring close to home the possibilites of what discrimination and racial intolerance leads to if left undealt with. In many ways, our world is faced with these things and these movies really shed light on these issues of intolerance and persecution yet they manage to be highly entertaining. Get them today. I look forward to X3 when it comes out around in 2006!",1069718400,8,3661,4.885852090032154
1424153,5,B00005BJDW,"Lately there have been a great many comic book based films coming out, and reportedly there are many more to come. Unfortunately most of these films are sloppy, rushed, and seem to care more about having flashy special effects than actually putting together a good plot, and a smart directing style. The first X-Men film set the stage for the seriousness that should be taken with a comic based film, X2 is the film that really deliver's on the promise of the first, and stands out as one of the best comic book adaptions (ranking with Tim Burton's Batman, and the Superman films). The inticate plot and multiple story derivations and side stories make it nearly impossible to look away from the screen. The action is upped in this second installment, and a feeling of urgency leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat. To add even further to the intensity of the film, several actors make breakout performances (Hugh Jackman), and some legends of film nail their roles with pin-point accuracy (Ian McKellen). In conclusion, this film has enough plot driven action to please the general movie goer, acting performances that will please us critics out their, and more than ample comic references to keep any X-Men fanatic bouncing for months. The bottom line, If you didn't get a chance to see this in theatre's, don't hesitate to pick it up on DVD. 1.5 makes for a perfect complement to the excellent X2....",1067472000,10,1409,4.755102040816326
1424154,4,B00005BJDW,"Okay first things first! This DVD box set is great for the fans of the X-Men movie franchise. You get tons of extras, in addition to the two hit movies! You find over ten hours of behind-the-scenes and trailers to keep you busy!
However if you truly want the complete package, then be wary, as while it's great, you may also want to pick up the first DVD prior to 'X-Men 1.5', as that DVD contains a hidden gag reel, preliminary designs for Beast and the Blob, in addition to the Fox special that was aired for the movie. This is if you need everything from the first movie!
Also however for all buyers, be wary as there is still another movie in the works, with a possibility of an additional three after 'X3', so there will be more DVDs in the future, including possible re-issues of the movies with even more features, so buyer beware.",1065830400,65,838,4.378205128205129

1424156,5,B00005BJDW,"I've never been much for The X-Men in particular, but I am a big fan of some of their enemies, especially The cyborg Reavers, who are featured in this episode. Unfortunately, my favorite Reavers,{and the highest ranking members, in the comics], Pretty Boy, Bone Breaker, and Skull Buster, had no lines, but they had some great action scenes and the artwork was excellent. Lady Deathstrike was wonderfully acted, an insane and bitter woman so driven by honor and revenge that she would willingly replace parts of her body with cybernetics just for the chance to kill Wolverine. Reavers Cole, Macon, and Reese had good [if brief] parts as well. The story was fairly good, though the Spirit Drinker looked too much like the ID Monster from The Forbidden Planet, somehow the story didn't seem long enough, and The Reavers didn't have big enough parts, but other than that it was an excellent video.",1019692800,,894,4.849673202614379

X-Men- 4.3/5

X-Men United- 4.4/5",1224288000,,511,4.163265306122449
1424182,5,B00005BJDW,"Again, I'll say it's not easy to make a movie about super heroes, especially popular heroes that have been around for 40+ years.

It's a challenge to make a movie that appeals to people like myself, who were around to see the beginnings of Marvel and the X-Men in the 1960's, in addition to other generations who've followed the characters in the decades since. And then it's not so easy to appeal to those who've never heard of Marvel or the X-Men.

I did a little research, and confirmed my guess. The movies reflect a combination of different lineups over the decades.

The original team consisted of Professor X, Cyclops, Angel, Beast, Ice Man, and ""Marvel Girl"" (Jean Grey.) Beast looked more human, in that he originally didn't have the blue fur.

In 1975, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Wolverine and others were introduced.

There were even more changes, and different ""factions"" of X-men in the past 40+ years. In the 1990's, the X-men started wearing the suits that are seen in the X-Men movies.

It's difficult to follow the movie with so many X-men. This is especially true in X-Men, The Last Stand. I can't help wonder why they didn't limit the sheer number of characters. They could have chosen to introduce them in future X-Men movies.

The first X-Men movie introduces Wolverine and Rogue... They have a very dynamic and dramatic relationship... a friendship rather than a romantic relationship. Rogue can literally suck the life out of people, while Wolverine has amazing recuperative powers, coming back from the Brink of Death.

We see some of Magneto's background, and perhaps get a better understanding of what made him the villain of the movie. We see his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and witness their plot to turn normal humans into mutants. It's a great story.

X2 depicts more insights into Wolverine's origins, and introduces General Stryker, a human villain, intent on exterminating all mutants. We see the powerful Magneto reduced to a helpless, tortured prisoner, and his eventual escape. We see the unlikely alliance between the Evil Mutants and the X-Men, and so much more.

Again, another great movie.",1214697600,,2134,4.9523809523809526

Packed with great interviews of all the actors,and behind the scene footage of the making of the movies. Seeing how the special effects were conceived was facinating. This boxed set was worth every penny and I recommend it to anyone who is an xmen fan.",1180224000,2,366,4.71875
1424185,5,B00005BJDW,"When I first saw the first X-Men movie I was highly impressed by the special effects, but the plot nearly bored me to tears. But I can't say that about X2: X-men United.

In this outing, there are several good plots here, all of them leading to spectacular action scenes. Chief among these is William Stryker's (an advisor to the president) is his plan to kill off all of the mutants: first by initiating an attempt on the president's life that is more than it seems at first, then using knowledge he gains from Magneto, who has been imprisoned in his all plastic cage since the end of the first movie. Once he knows all about Cerebro, Professor Xavier's special computer for locating mutants, he then captures Professor X  and forces him to attempt to kill all mutants.

Another plot involves Wolverine's attempt to learn about his past from Stryker. In trying to learn his past, Wolverine encounters a vicious female version of himself equipped with his own powers of regeneration and claws to boot. His battle with her is not to be missed.

There's yet another plot where Magneto attempts to turn Stryker's plan around and to kill all the humans instead of mutants. All of these elements and more fit beautifully together in this film where we are introduced to new characters like Nightcrawler and Pyro, and we see the loss (?) of one of the core X-Men characters. This is a much better movie than it's predecessor-- and at 135 minute, nearly two and a half hours-- it's a much longer movie, too, but one that's well worth watching. It would have been nice if a few lose ends had been tied up, but I guess then there wouldn't be anything for the sequel you can just feel is coming.",1133222400,4,1685,4.551155115511551

They look and sound great.  I found the extras, however, to be a little lacking.  There were some interviews done during the shooting of X2 but nothing especially produced for X-Men 1 and so nothing from actors who didn't appear in the sequel.  Most of the features were originally produced as marketing material or for the general TV audience and there is relatively little for the hard-core fan.

It is as if there are living among us in this society, not futuristic or colorful costume wearing ""cape crusaders"", facing  similar political issues of this government and other nations as well.

In X2, towards the end of the story, the viewer is left thinking if there will be hope and more to the X-men stories to come the after trajedy.
