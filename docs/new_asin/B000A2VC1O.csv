8072693,1,B000A2VC1O,"Unfortunately, I ordered this together with the Sid Caesar DVD (which by the way is great!) While watching these, hoping to catch a bit of my childhood, I realized something: I didn't actually watch any of these when I was a kid. For a very good reason: they are boring. To call these comedies is being far too generous. We didn't even finish the darn thing. My wife asked, ""Do you want to keep watching more of these?"" and I gratefully said ""No, I was only watching because I thought you did.""
Maybe I'll see if there's a collection of Sergeant Bilko, or Maverick, or better yet, the Richard Boone Theater.",1431561600,,607,4.4774774774774775
8072694,5,B000A2VC1O,"Fifty years ago my favorite program was the Andy Griffith Show.  Now it's the Big Bang Theory.  Things have sure changed.

Younger folks probably won't enjoy these, but I'm not young, and I really liked these reminders of just how much our entertainment has evolved.  Some changes have been for the better, but there's still some good humor in the old stuff.

I especially got a laugh out of the ""Lucky Strike"" commercial.  Of course, back then it was meant to be taken seriously.  We really were supposed to believe that Lucky Strikes just tasted better than other cigarettes.

Another highlight?  The parody of courtroom television was every bit as funny as modern parodies.

This collection was worth every penny.",1370304000,5,716,4.891666666666667
8072695,5,B000A2VC1O,This dvd gave me a touch of the old shows I saw as a kid. It included original commercials and sponsor plugs. The overall quality is excellent. I was reminded how live television was created. Lots of fun!,1294617600,7,204,4.394736842105263
