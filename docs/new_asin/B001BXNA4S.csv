According to IMDb, original running time for the Technicolor documentary entitled ""The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress"" (1944) is 45 minutes. If Product Details here are accurate, this download is short 5 minutes.

Directed by William Wyler, this film features actual footage of the famed B-17's 25th and final bombing mission.

We see the Belle's crew members in action as they maneuver among deadly flak bursts and battle faster, more agile Messerschmidts. The target (if they reach it and weather cooperates): submarine pens located in Wilhelmshafen, Germany.

This remarkable movie has in abundance something Hollywood's aviation war pictures rarely even approach: the realism of actual men riaking their lives in the confines of an easily downable airship, and bravely doing so in broad daylight over hostile enemy territory. When the story's over and Belle's safely on the ground, it's quite evident that this foray was one for the history books.",1372809600,,980,5.303225806451613
