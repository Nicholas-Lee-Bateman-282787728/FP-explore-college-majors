surely made in the era of AUSTRALIAN RENNAISANCE CINEMA as it has all the hallmarks of GREATNESS.

the acting, cinematography and script ALL first rate.

8659568,2,B00KJNXV36,"What an awful let-down, after watching ""The High Commissioner"", the first Jon Cleary opus-turned-movie about Scobie Malone and starring Rod Taylor to see this . . .  thing. It must have been early in Jack Thompson's career when it was made as he went on to star in wonderful, touching movies. The work is not indicative of the Inspector Malone who evolved through many of Cleary's novels. Instead it was was free-for-all triteness. Instead of being touched, I kept considering touching the ""eject"" button.
Cleary must have been furious, as several of his other novels: The Sundowners and High Road to China were beautifully translated into film.",1428364800,,645,5.02803738317757
