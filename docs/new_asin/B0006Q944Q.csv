2191224,5,B0006Q944Q,"I bought this set of movies for my nephew for his 3rd birthday. He loves monster trucks, tractors, motorcycles and trains--and he loves these movies.  Even my brother-in-law has enjoyed watching them with him because he learned new things about the subjects (for example, how they load the monster trucks into the tractor trailers).  Each movie has two episodes (about 30 minutes per episode).  You can choose which episode you want to watch.  Overall, fun and informative movies.",1156809600,,480,5.115384615384615
2191225,4,B0006Q944Q,My 22 month old son is fascinated with all things transportation so I was excited to purchase the Hard Hat Harry six-pack.  It has everything!  He is currently fixated on the Monster Truck video which we watch over and over but he will also watch the other videos when I force him and can't take watching Monster Trucks anymore.  The videos are cheesy but entertaining.  They are also educational which I like.  Each video lasts about 30 minutes or so which is just short enough to keep his interest and just long enough for me to get dinner ready.  I am glad that I purchased this set.,1156291200,,586,4.429906542056075
2191226,5,B0006Q944Q,These movies are awesome.  My son is 3 and he loves them.  If you have a child that lose big trucks or tractors.  These will be perfect for them.  My 3 year old niece loves fire truck one so see it is meant for everyone.  I even caught my 8 year old watching them.,1152748800,,264,3.814814814814815
2191227,5,B0006Q944Q,"These videos have been an absolute god-send for our two sons.  They have learned so much about vehicles.  We now spend the time driving looking for different types of trucks/farm equipment, and talking about what each one does.  Many of the original songs used as a soundtrack are great too.  I think my elder son's first song he sang was the ""Mighty Mega Monster Truck"" song from the monster truck vehicle.  The (over)acting by Harry was initially painful, but the kids loved it and it has grown on me to the point where these are my favorites of the kid's videos.  The speech is clear, the videos are fun, everyone is happy, and there is no conflict.  These are absolutely perfect educational videos for kids from 1 to 4.  I learned a lot too.  I had always wondered why combines were called combines...",1141171200,4,805,4.573426573426573
2191228,5,B0006Q944Q,"This was an easy decision to make!  It's got all the great Hard Hat Harry DVD's.  We have two boys so, it was a no brainer for us.  They love it and I love that if they have to watch something at least it's educational.",1124150400,3,219,3.8222222222222224
2191229,5,B0006Q944Q,"Our 2 and something year old son LOVES these shows!

 Originally our neighbor passed on a VHS tape of the Farm Adventure episode that we could only watch in the bedroom, since we don't have a VCR in the living room anymore. We'd be stuck watching this tape in the bedroom all the time with our son.

 We decided to buy the 6 pack, and it basically contains all existing Episodes of Hard Hat Harry, with 2 Episodes per DVD.  The show was produced in 1995, and it only recently got transferred to DVD, which we're very grateful for. No extras or anything, but who cares? Each Episode features Hard Hat Harry exploring the different machines and equipment with 2 different kids each time, a boy and a girl.

 Our son definitely has his favorites, like Farm Equipment, Helicopters and Monster Trucks, but we're slowly making our way through all of them and we even learned a few interesting things along the way.

 If you have a kid who's fascinated with cars and trucks, these DVDs are definitely worth it!",1123632000,7,1003,4.527777777777778
2191230,5,B0006Q944Q,"My son is 2 and a few months and he pretends he is Hard Hat Harry ALL THE TIME! We have 4 dvds and we watch them constantly. I wasn't sure he was paying real attention to what was going on, but we passed a different shaped firetruck and he knew exactly what it was and told me all about Hard Hat Harry until we got home to watch it.",1121731200,2,332,3.757142857142857
2191231,5,B0006Q944Q,"I don't know what it is--my husband & I think this series could not be any cheesier or more low budget--but my kids (girl aged 1 1/2 & boy almost 3) absolutely L*O*V*E it!  Does not matter which one; fire trucks, helicopters...they cannot get enough and  want to watch again & again & AGAIN.  They hardly want to watch regular TV anymore and that's fine with us because these shows are at least somewhat educational.",1118016000,4,416,4.52

8042339,4,B0006Q944Q,"My son watched the original Hard Hat Harry episodes on TV when he was little and loved them.  I got these for him for his 23rd birthday as a joke, but he was so happy with them I think the joke was on me.  They're great.",1436659200,,220,3.760869565217391

8042341,3,B0006Q944Q,My 3 1/2 year old really likes these. The DVDs were made in 1995 so they are pretty old though.,1218412800,,95,3.8
8042342,4,B0006Q944Q,"I ordered this because my grandson watched the Firetruck VHS over and over, and it finally got ""eaten"" by the player and destroyed.  Now he enjoys all 6 of the DVDs.",1202515200,,165,4.32258064516129
8042343,5,B0006Q944Q,"My nephew (who is a couple years older than my son) liked these videos, so when I saw one at the library I checked it out to see if my 2 year old would be interested.  He LOVED it.  We had the 2 videos the library had (trains and airplanes and trucks and firetrucks) in constant rotation for a month, so we decided to get this 6-pack for him for Christmas. It was a big hit.  The videos are actually very interesting, and I've found myself learning things about certain subjects (monster trucks, for instance) that I never knew!  The acting is a little corny, and the whole genie-thing is a tad creepy, but the kid doesn't seem to mind. Overall, they are great videos: they are fun as well as educational. Though they seem targeted for an older child (maybe 4-8?) They hold my sons attention (he's 27 months now) quite well.  Overall, a great value for 6 videos.  I think any kid interested in trucks and heavy equipment (which seems to be nearly every preschool boy I know) would appreciate these videos.",1199923200,,1005,4.434782608695652
8042344,4,B0006Q944Q,"My boys, 1 and 3, love these videos, especially monster trucks and farm equipment. The genie is annoying, but I have learned to tune the whole thing out after repeated viewings.",1199059200,,177,4.741935483870968
8042345,5,B0006Q944Q,"We bought this six pack of Hard Hat Harry DVDs for our 2 1/2 year old. He loves all kinds of vehicles and these DVDs totally fit the bill. Not only do they capture his interest, but they are quite educational as well. Hard Hat Harry is a ""genie"" who pops up to teach kids all about how a vehicle works. There is some music but mostly it is interaction between Harry and two kids (a boy and a girl). No scary scenes and not insipidly syrupy sweet like some other DVDs. I would highly recommend these DVDs to anybody with a curious kid -- boy or girl. They would also be super for an older child (like up to age 6 or 7).",1198454400,,618,3.9919354838709675
8042346,5,B0006Q944Q,"My son loved the original HHH video, which was an hour long. We picked up these. The produciton quality and plot lines are a little cheesy, but hey, we're here for the big machines, not for Shakespeare, right?

My only complaint is that some of them are rather short 20-25 minutes. I don't know if they deliberately made them that long to fit on TV someday (with commercials) or what. However, if it wasn't good, we wouldn't want MORE!!!",1197331200,,437,4.531645569620253
8042347,5,B0006Q944Q,"The videos are cheesy, but WOW do they grab the attention of little ones!
My son is almost 2 and he constantly wants to see these videos!  Hard Hat Harry is very enthusiastic and always explains what things are and how things work.  My son loves Hard Hat Harry's singing and dancing, so much he joins in!",1188172800,,304,4.315789473684211
