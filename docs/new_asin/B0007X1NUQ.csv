The first two, ""Video-mail of Revenge"" and ""Sakura on my Mind"" are a little disappointing, being flash-back episodes cut from previous episodes. However the other two episodes, ""Scramble! Rescue Lum!"" and ""Death Match: Ataru vs Mendou's Army"" are a two-part story that makes TV27 one of the highpoints of the collection. Lum's UFO malfunctions and crashes on the Mendou estate - Lum is unhurt but suffers amnesia. Mendou sees the opportunity to rewrite the script with himself as Lum's ""Darling"", but Lum can't shake the feeling that there's someone else. Ataru, aided by the ""Gang of Four"" (Megane and co) storms the estate. Lecherous and unfaithful he may be, but as he says: he hates the way Lum tries to pin him down, but someone else taking Lum from him is worse! Much fun, and many explosions.",1157673600,,933,4.801242236024844
