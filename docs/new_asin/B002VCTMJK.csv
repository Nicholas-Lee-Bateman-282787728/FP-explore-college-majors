I feel more connected with the place that I lived for so many years. The local schools should consider adding this film to the history class or as extra credit, as it's very informative and well made. I highly recommend this DVD.",1498262400,,405,4.413333333333333

8381895,5,B002VCTMJK,"This evocative documentary of my hometown brought light and shadow to my memories of growing up in La Crescenta at a transformative time--a time when as a young boy I could play outside for hours in vacant lots teeming with  horned-toed lizards and other creatures, ride our bikes up and down hills until dusk, hike along creek beds and canyons in the hills above our house, and camp overnight with friends in my front yard, all without a bit of worry or supervision from our parents. The film revealed the shadow of my hometown too--the Japanese internment camp that my mom told me about when I was five years old and the Nazi rallies that drew thousands of American fascists to a local park where just a few years later we would gather for bonfires at Boy Scout jamborees. This is a wonderful, sobering, and sometimes nostalgic documentary about California life of a different time, leading up to the edge of big changes that gave us the California we live in today, as those long-ago days turn into mostly forgotten times. A gracious thank you to the director and others who compiled the local history with the footage and accompanying piano score to preserve this history of a place that growing up seemed so far away from Los Angeles, and yet nowadays seems so near.",1394928000,,1271,4.648888888888889
8381896,5,B002VCTMJK,"This was a very entertaining, quick-moving film about the early history of the Crescenta-Canada valley just north of Los Angeles: La Canada Flintridge, La Crescenta, Montrose, and North Glendale. It alos includes some of Tujunga's history as well as Pasadena. The movie is three parts, each covering a different aspect of the valley's history. Plus there's another hour of rare footage including Nazi rallies in La Crescenta in the 1930's, swimming in Indian Springs in Montrose, and rare home movies shot in the 1920's. I highly recommend this film! A must for anyone interested in Los Angeles history.
