894092,5,630451087X,"American audiences are so used to being spoon-fed the same crap in movies that movies like Lost Highway are rejected by audiences because they don't have a plot that a second-grader could understand. Yes, the plot in Lost  Highway is very difficult to follow, no matter how smart you are. You'll  definitely have to watch it several times to catch all the  intricacies.
Some problems with it.. the first hour of the film was  horrendously boring. David Lynch could have easily shortened the film by  30-40 minutes if he cut out all the scenes with Pullman staring blankly  into nothing.
I was grateful for all the sex and nudity, too. Finally a  director has the guts to make a movie with *gasp* promiscuous sex in it.
Don't let my glowing review fool you, though. Chances are you probably  won't like this movie. Oh, well.",914025600,,823,4.666666666666667
894093,1,630451087X,"Lost Highway is certainly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Until the last moment, I was somewhat intrigued by the incomprehensible story, waiting for answers. It was extremely difficult to stand the many  unpleasant and disgusting scenes of the movie, yet I was hoping that at  least it was all for a purpose. However, when I discovered that all of this  was only for its own sake and could never be explained by anything other  than ""life itself"" (probable meaning of the title), I could find  no excuse for the existence of this work. What kind of life is this,  anyway?! Musically, this is one of the most memorable films I have ever  seen, but when the beautiful sountrack is wasted in such a pathetic way, it  does not redeem the movie too much. Definitely the most unpleasant film by  David Lynch so far.",912816000,,823,4.54421768707483
894094,5,630451087X,"Once you indulge into the world of david lynch, it is hard to come back from the reality of non essential life.
Lost Highway portrays the lack of control that every mind has over what reality exists inside this world,  inside the lost highways of our mind.
As pullman accurately points out,  ""I like to remember things my own way"", that is, an icon to life,  it does not really matter who you are, what you encounter in life, as much  as how you decide to remember everything that comes about in life.
David  Lynch (Twin Peaks) has once again proved his worth as a director, as the  ambient of the movie, the darkness and feeling of the movie can really  involve and devour the attention of the viewer...",911779200,,704,4.410852713178294
894095,5,630451087X,"It's easy for the hard-core Lynch fan to love this movie.  It's got all  the traditional Lynchian motifs, and then some:  severe head injuries,  blueish electricity, the supernatural, the dream-like. But Lynch newcomers  can appreciate the story as well!  The trick is to not ask any questions  while watching the movie.  Don't try to follow the logic of the story right  off.  Maybe there isn;t any logic, or maybe it's LYNCH's LOGIC.  Heheheh.  At any rate, the film is stellar no matter how you look at it.  Moody,  semi-psycho performance from Bill Pullman is probably his best role to  date, aside from perhaps The Zero Effect.  Patricia Arquette plays both a  blonde and a brunette to startling effect, and her full lips fill up the  screen beautifully. And who could forget Robert Blake as the Mystery Man!  No combination of spooky make-up, fantastic lighting and prime direction  could have evoked the sheer terror that Blake's face does. To sum up, this  movie is a must see!

David Lynch is the cinematic version of Salvador Dali with a penchant for letting the dripping clocks fall over the edge every now and then, and allowing a (nearly) traditional narrative to peek into the frame.

894261,5,630451087X,"The German Blu-ray looks great; its a very noticeable improvement over the DVD.
I think Lost Highway is easier to understand then people think.
In interviews with David Lynch, he talks about the OJ Simpson murder case, how, in his mind, OJ was indeed guilty, and what he must have to create in his mind to live a normal life after such a violent and horrific act.
Lynch also said, the film is very much about psychogenic fugue (now known as Dissociative fugue).
So, taking what Lynch said, and reading about the symptoms of Dissociative fugue, I have come up with my own interpratation of the movie.
The first shot we see, is Fred Madisons (Bill Pullman) fugue (Latin for flight) as he drives the dark highway. The film has begun even as the credits roll, and Fred has already killed his wife and lover.
The entire film, save for the opening shot, and last scene where the cops have caught on, and are in hot pursuit, is happening in his mind.
The video images represent reality, something Fred wants to escape from; they show the evidence of his guilt. Fred re-interprets reality and invents identities. He wants to remember the events the way he likes to, not necessarily the way it happened.
All of this, the whole story in the film, is taking place in Freds mind, as he flees the scene in his car.
Fred is in a fugue state, until he slowly realizes, bit by bit, that he really did kill and dismember his wife.
So in the last scene, Fred is caught, and being chased by police, in real time. Freds fugue state ends in him completely freaking out, he is a monster, he can no longer escape into his idyllic Pete fantasy.
The last shot is the total mental breakdown of Freds mind.
Anyway, until something better comes along, thats how I read Lost Highway. Its actually less complex then I thought on my first viewing.",1475107200,4,1816,4.4894259818731115

894297,3,630451087X,"Inevitably viewers, on seeing LOST HIGHWAY for the first time, might ask what on earth is happening; or perhaps try to look for symbols in order to decode what director David Lynch has to say about contemporary American - specifically Californian - society.

Perhaps it might be better to approach the film on its own terms as a meditation on the fluidity of identity, where Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is sentenced to death in the electric chair for the murder of his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette), and subsequently morphs into Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), who becomes involved with Alice Wakefield (also played by Arquette) and mobster Ed (Louis Eppolito). As the action unfolds, Alice morphs into Renee. Throughout the action a mysterious presence lurks, with a whitened face and forbidding air (Robert Blake); he ostensibly works for Ed, but he seems to be able to penetrate even the most private spaces.

Lynch has chosen the most commonplace names for his two male characters to emphasize their ordinariness; they could be anyone we encounter in our daily lives. Nonetheless what happens within their imaginations is very different from their quotidian behaviors; they are both tortured souls either unable or unwilling to conquer the wild and often horrific promptings of their unconscious minds. Renee appears to be dead; but then she mysteriously resurfaces later on in the film. Alice at one point tells Pete ""You will never have me,"" suggesting a male desire for possession that will never take place in a dystopian world.

The ""Lost Highway"" of the title is frequently shown in point of view shot, as a vehicle travels up a deserted road at night, with only the road markings visible. This might be both physical as well as mental; a metaphor of the male protagonists' diseased minds as well as a representation of just how threatening a landscape can be, especially at night when there are no lights to illuminate the street.

LOST HIGHWAY is the kind of movie that consciously resists interpretation, and justifiably so. It requires considerable attention on the viewers' part, not only to appreciate the subtleties of director Lynch's directorial technique, but to decode what is happening in a series of visually complicated sequences. It is the kind of film that demands repeated viewings - not necessary to ""understand"" it better, but to appreciate just how carefully Lynch constructs it.",1468108800,,2409,5.075757575757576

Not believing him, the mystery man has Fred call his house on his cell phone, where he's talking to the mystery man on the other line while standing in front of him at the same time.

Lost Highway (1997) is vintage David Lynch - surrealism, confusion, atmosphere, nudity, things that don't make much sense...that sort of stuff.  This movie stars Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, Robert Blake, Gary Busey, Balthazar Getty, etc.  The acting is strong throughout.  The music really enhances the mood of the film.  If you like other similar Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive (2001) and Blue Velvet (1986), then this movie should be right up your alley as well.  I don't think this movie is quite as good as the two above mentioned movies, but it's still a strong effort.

894478,5,630451087X,"............to describe this movie, but in a good way. Is Lost Highway a mess? Yes it is, but it's an enjoyable mess. The premise of director and co-writer David Lynch is to convey the complexity and confusion of one's dreams. Therefore, the weakly-linked 'plot' is an afterthought. The reason why I give this movie 5 stars is because it is sheer surrealism (a Lynch trademark) and captivates with a supporting cast that have very memorable performances, such as Robert Blake. His performance was priceless. His character is mysterious, ridiculous, terrifying, yet funny all rolled into one. Robert Loggia delivers an intense performance as Mr. Eddy; his character has similar traits to Dennis Hopper's character (Frank Booth) in Blue Velvet. This movie failed at the box office, probably due to limited showings, as well as people not understanding it. This movie wasn't meant to be understood, similar to 2001's Mulholland Drive, which received critical praise. David Lynch movies are often open-ended and never strive to go mainstream, which is why they appeal to people like me. I recommend this movie for something out of the ordinary. Give it a chance, and know that it's not meant to make total sense.",1409961600,8,1208,5.075376884422111
894479,4,630451087X,"I've been a fan of Lynch since the Twin Peaks TV series, which I was really way too young to be watching! I was in my late teens when Lost Highway came out, and at the time thought it was an utter failure of a film. But I watched it several times as a Lynch fan, each time finding I didn't think it made any sense.

Then, feeling some Lynch nostalgia, I picked up the newer DVD release and rewatched it. First, the new DVD that's in widescreen ratio is gorgeous. I did see the film in theaters, but most of my rewatching was on VHS in 4:3 ratio. That left me remembering this film as somewhat ugly (from a visual standpoint), which it is not at all! The cinematography is absolutely stunning. If you haven't seen this film since it was re-released in widescreen and you're at all curious, you owe it to yourself to rewatch it.

I also found that this go round I didn't find the film all that confusing at all. I'm not sure if I just wasn't emotionally mature enough to get much of what was being discussed in the film when it first came out or if I just wasn't as intelligent as I imagine I was. Either way, the overall narrative seems fairly straightforward to me--

[SPOILERS!]

FWIW--I think the timeline starts at the hotel where Fred finds Laurent with Renee/Alice. Fred waits for Renee to leave, pulls Laurent out of the hotel and drags him to the beach house where Fred kills Laurent and burns the beach house down to hide his crime. He goes home and confesses to himself what he's done--then promptly lets that part of himself that did it flee from his life. Meanwhile, in a fugue state, Fred continues his life with Renee. At the party, what he's done comes back to haunt him and in his confused state he all but lets slip that he's killed Laurent. Once that break occurs, the reality at the beach house and the reality in his attempt to continue with a normal life merge and he snaps and perhaps does for Renee, too. Then the Pete narrative plays out as Fred tries to piece together his life and continue to justify and hide from himself his murder of Dick Laurent who is now quit literally a Mister E. (mystery). Fred's internal narrative leads him back to the beach house and the murder of Mr. Laurent, something he can never escape no matter how many times he tries to rewind the smoke back into the building.

That's the bulk of how I see the plot. I would also note that Fred is the night version of Pete. I think perhaps he plays saxophone some nights at clubs, which is his ""cool"" self, but his day job is as a mechanic. The Jack Nance scene makes even more sense if Nance's character is really telling Fred/Pete that he likes Fred/Pete's music. ""Hey, don't be ashamed of what you've done"" is what Nance is telling his friend when he says ""I liked that"" after Pete turns off his own playing. Not surprising that Fred/Pete would have a lot of shame over what he's done.

[END SPOILERS]

My narrative structure is obviously just one of many interpretations out there. But it does show that the film can hold together if given the chance.

And the more important point here is that if you're thinking of rewatching the film after years away--as you well might be given that it's a nearly 20 year old film and you're on Amazon looking at reviews--then I recommend it with the new 16:9 transfer. It's a real treat for the mind and eyes.",1409011200,,3348,4.362760834670947

I also bought this video because the Lost Highway involved Richard Pryor who's last movie role was in this movie before he passed away.  During the first 30 to 45 minutes of the movie I did not see Richard Pryor in the movie and that was a bit of a disappointment, but on the other hand I guess that Richard's role was a bit more of a cameo performance and had no bearing on the plot of this movie.  Also, Bill Pullman was the man who did a good job in ""Independence Day"" a year earlier so I don't understand the reason for him taking this role - Maybe he wanted to do something different?

Another genius Lynch endeavor, where he takes a common issue and portrays it as something deep, dark and identifiable by every person who is brave enough to watch this film.

In this film, Lynch 's work is once again questioning the watcher about the limits of identity. Significant gaps stripping the man of his personality or otherwise dangerous reconciliations conducting to the merger between two characters , the viewer finds himself tossed back into a total slump.

We must therefore accept the link between the two main actors who nevertheless doesn't occur at any time, their only common point being to love the same woman and have the same bad people against them.
Note also the Manichean confinement scenario in a sequence in the middle of the film where the big bad boss freely attack an innocent driver accused to stick too close to the bumper .

Till this childish and vulgar end where an analogy is made between our vigilante who's followed on the road by a pack of cops and his wife when she is taken doggy style during mafia pornography sessions , all of which being supported by the disturbing music of the metal band Rammstein where a voice barely edgy dominates solid electric guitar riffs executed methodically.",1386374400,,1306,4.8

894561,2,630451087X,"When ultra-weird guru David Lynch had a winner, it was special and often almost transcendental (Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet). But sometimes he had mediocre fare. We are pulled slowly (slowly, yes: that was expected, as Lynch likes to takes his sweet time) into the world of Fred and Renee, a boring and quiet couple of characters who seem pulled out of Lynch's childhood of going to the Saturday matinee to see ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"". They soon learn that someone has been videotaping them while they sleep, and has been leaving the VHS on their doorstep. What follows this first curiosity is standard Lynchian touches and mood (glaring little end-table lamps, red curtains, shapeshifting, lingering close-ups of frosted pink lipstick, silence interrupted by loud telephone ringing, duality, mayhem, women being humiliated, Jack Nance, et cetera), but it's all not half as interesting or fun as some of his other films, even the wacky lovers-on-the-run-from-the-wicked-witch ""Wild at Heart"".

Overall, ""Lost Highway"" is not a high quality entry in the nightmare world of Mr. Lynch. It didn't work for me. It has glimpses of interesting things, but that's not enough. Now, I did enjoy Bill Pullman here because he seemed unlike himself-- distant, cool, almost sullen.

Robert Blake deserves kudos for taking the role of the role of the Mystery Man,  who serves (perhaps!) as Fred Madison's conscience, alter ego and partner in murder.

This means that he receives the corrolaries of our unbalanced appreciation of his magic art: fanboyism and effusive appreciation. Essentially, his fans can begin to see his art as a perceptual bench press machine on which to exercise their powers of appreciation. There is very little the human mind cannot appreciate or find meaning in, when the intention is set to do so. There are rocks and trees which the Buddha would have given 5 stars, if you get my meaning.

Lynch's Lost Highway disregards narrative structure and typical plotline progression, takes an oblique/surrealist approach to character development, and leaves the viewer mostly in the dark about what is happening through most of the film. The pacing is slow enough to allow the viewer to truly enjoy the delicious, almost unequalled visuals. The visuals are so stunning, that in spite of everything, I sometime watch bits of this film to enjoy them again. However the enjoyment of the visuals is such that it often leads the viewer to wonder: does this film have a larger meaning outside of its own aesthetic beauty?

The viewer is given an intimate experience of stunning, sensuous imagery, but not one with any coherent movement or meaning. The dissonance coded into the film's progression is deliberately jarring and is effectively suspenseful, but in a bad, bad way. It is building a monotonic, unresolved, almost sadistic suspense which happens at the expense of the viewer's enjoyment. A chord progression that ceaselessly emphasizes the ii/vii/minor-7th chords is not going to give a pleasant resolution, and carried on for longer than 2 minutes would just be tedious beyond imagining. Yet Lynch isn't afraid to go into that territory plot-wise with this unending mystery-within-a-mystery shell game.

894647,4,630451087X,"""Lost Highway"" (1997) is directed by David Lynch. The film is about a saxophonist named Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) who murders his wife (Patricia Arquette) for being unfaithful and then goes insane in prison. Most of the film seems to be about Fred's surreal recollections after he is imprisoned, which are filled with dread, erotic recollections and the despair of a banal distrustful life. 135 minutes seems just about right for this film as it finishes with a flurry of bizarre and haunting images. Lynch cut this film down by 25 minutes after its initial screening.

The 2002/2003 full screen dvd is a horrible transfer so be careful to only buy the 2008 Universal Studios' Focus Features dvd version which is in the proper anamorphic widescreen format of 2.35:1 with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio.

The movie tells the story in a way that you have to really pay attention to, everything seems random while most scenes are very deliberate.  Leaves ya to really do some figuring out on your own.
All in all I somewhat enjoyed it, I will probably never watch it again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.",1313193600,,590,4.157894736842105

***Spoilers within***

The Film 4.5/5

The DVD release from Universal Studios claims a 2 hour 25 minute running time, but that's actually a printing error. Both that and this Blu-ray version clock in at 2 hours 15 minutes. All of the original DVD scenes are intact.

David Lynch is my favorite director, although Quentin Tarantino isn't far behind. Lynch appeals so much because his films create worlds with a distinct feel. He's very precise and chooses the exact sound or image needed to complete his vision. When I watch Mulholland Dr. or Blue Velvet, my normal world ceases to exist; it's pure escapism. For that reason, I chose to import Lost Highway from Germany. Who knows when we'll see a North American release?

All of Lynch's films are challenging. He rarely uses a linear plot structure and the line between what is real and what is imagined is usually blurred. Lost Highway is one of the most difficult films to interpret, but it can still be enjoyed even if you don't fully understand everything on the screen.

The film opens with the image of a road. We're traveling down it at night to the sound of David Bowie's I'm Deranged. This was not a frivolous choice and is a major hint at what you can expect to follow. This is a film about madness. In fact, I believe it is a look inside the mind of a killer. Think about how difficult that is to achieve.

There are thousands of films about killers, but how many of them show the true motivation for murder? Lost Highway hints at motivation and gives an idea of how such a person might think. That's one reason why the plot is such a mess. Insane thoughts wouldn't always follow a logical pattern.

We see a glimpse of how Fred (Pullman) and Renee (Arquette) Madison live. He's a musician and fears that his wife is being unfaithful. He wants to go out, but she prefers to stay home. When he calls, she doesn't answer and his suspicion grows. The next morning, she discovers a yellow envelope outside the front door. There's no address or note, but it contains a video showing the outside of the house. Another envelope shows up the following day and this time it shows Fred and Renee asleep in bed. The police are called in, but don't discover anything out of the ordinary.

Fred tells the police that they don't own a video camera. In fact, he hates them because he likes to remember things his own way rather than how they happened. That's another clue that we can't rely on anything shown from Fred's viewpoint.

One of my favorite scenes happens early in the story. Fred and Renee go to a party and Fred talks to a weird looking man. The man informs him that they previously met at Fred's house and that he's there right now. That sounds crazy, but the man gives Fred a phone and tells him to call him at the house. The man appears to answer. He says that Fred invited him and he never goes where he's not wanted. As it's impossible to be in two places at once, this clearly represents something else. I think the man represents Fred's emotions. He's suspicious, jealous and angry.

A third tape shows Fred standing over Renee's corpse. Remember that he hates video cameras because they show what happened? I think Lynch is saying that what happens on video is Fred's reality and everything else is unreliable. There's further proof of this when Fred is arrested for the murder of his wife.

All of these events occur in the first 40 minutes of the film. From that point on, things start to get really weird. If I were to analyze every scene it would ruin the film if you haven't seen it, so I'll stop there. All I can say is that events take a dramatic turn and initially seem impossible. But the more you think about it, the more it makes sense.

Mulholland Dr. also deals with identity and blurred reality. The two films are similar in feel in many ways. We see actors playing dual roles and we are not always sure whether any events are real. The film works as a collection of interesting scenes, but it's even more effective when you realize what is being portrayed. I won't pretend to understand everything and I am not sure I am supposed to.

The choice of music perfectly matches the mood. We hear from Rammstein, Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, Lou Reed, This Mortal Coil, and many others. The whole thing is held together by Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score.

The acting is very good. Pullman pulls off Fred's nervous demeanor perfectly and Arquette is suitably mysterious. I particularly liked Robert Loggia's performance and he oozed menace every time he was on the screen. Robert Blake as the Mystery Man sent shivers down my spine and he didn't always seem human. As well as a cameo from Marilyn Manson, watch out for a glimpse of Henry Rollins as a prison guard.

I enjoy all of Lynch's films. While Lost Highway doesn't quite hit the heights of Mulholland Dr. and Blue Velvet, it's still among my Top 25 from any genre. It won't appeal to everyone, but if you enjoy experiencing unsettling worlds, this might work for you too.

Video Quality 4.5/5
The DVD looks soft and I wasn't expecting Lost Highway to look very good on Blu-ray, but I was in for a surprise. Concorde Video has produced a wonderful transfer. Detail is exceptional for most of the film and I didn't detect any print damage or dirt. There were a few very infrequent white speckles, but I'm thrilled with the look of the Blu-ray. I can't imagine any future releases looking any better. The film is region free, but the special features are PAL. So you can watch the film in all its glory, but you won't have an image during the special features unless you use a region B or region free player. For the record, the Blu-ray includes chapters.

Audio Quality 4.5
The Blu-ray defaults to German: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 so you'll need to use the pop up menu to change to English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. It's a great track and displays the atmospheric scenes very well. This is a lively soundtrack, but the quieter scenes also benefit. The overall presentation is excellent. German subtitles are optional rather than forced.

Special Features 1/5

The PAL special features appear in standard definition. German subtitles are optional.

Making Of (9:28) - This isn't a typical making of feature. We're shown snapshots of Lynch directing a few scenes, but he doesn't talk to the camera. You'll see how he works, but don't expect him to explain his decisions.

Interview with David Lynch (4:53) - Lynch talks about Pullman and Arquette and how their acting ability helped the film.

Trailer (1:46)

The region free Blu-ray version of Lost Highway from Concorde Video is well worth your money and it's unlikely that future releases will produce anything better. It's available from Amazon Germany, but I acquired mine from Grooves Inc. for around $17 delivered. Give them a try if you're interested in importing the film. It won't appeal to everyone, but hopefully my review will help you decide whether it's for you. It's one of the best titles I have added in 2011.

894651,5,630451087X,"Add another piece of the puzzle every time you view this film.  I've seen it like 3 times and I still don't completely get it.  You can analyze it over and over and good luck by the way.  I love all the performances.  Patricia Arquette is one of my favourite actresses and her understated role in Lost Highway is restrained yet bizarre.  I liked the love sequence between her and Bill Pullman while a gothic song is playing in the background. I think it's by Dead Can Dance.  I hope David Lynch makes another weird film, he's one of my favourite directors and he needs to get to work again.",1305936000,,590,4.318181818181818
894652,5,630451087X,"Perhaps with the only exception of David Cronenberg and Chris Nolan in U.S.A., Roman Polanski and Peter Greenaway overseas, no other director like David Lynch has known to deal with the sequential breakthrough of the natural flow and the employment of the narrative elipsis, conveying the spectator into a twisted labyrinth of images, sounds and normal codes of the semiotic of the cinematographic language, this time he returned to the big screen with this cryptic thriller about confused identities and erotic obsession. Fred (Bill Pullman) is an avant-garde jazz saxophonist who shares a luxurious but fashionably barren house with his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette). Fred suspects that Renee may be unfaithful to him, but realizes he has bigger things to worry about when a series of videotapes appear at his door that prove someone is watching his home from the outside and inside. When Renee is found murdered, Fred finds himself behind bars, but one morning Fred is no longer in his cell. He has seemingly been transformed into Pete Drayton (Balthazar Getty), a young auto mechanic who foolishly allowed himself to get involved with the wife of gangster Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), a luscious blonde named Alice who looks exactly like Renee.

This gradual metamorphoses has a common departure point: the febrile obsession of unfaithfulness, fear, anguish and existential desperation so typical of the Post War years. You may realize how Renee and Alice Wakefield repeat similar dialogues.

I would like invite you my dear readers to watch Zentropa of Lars von Triers in which the hypnotic initial sequence of the highway seen from the driver's perspectve is just the same than the rails of a train in movement, and how Lynch as von Triers proceed to translate the viewer into a dreamlike state.

Overlooked by the great audiences, this film will captivate and engage you, only if you accept Lynch's rules of game; otherwise you will leave the hall with an acidic flavour.

A sumptuous masterpiece all the way through.",1304294400,2,2026,5.093373493975903
894653,5,630451087X,"I saw my first Lynch film last fall (Mulholland Dr) and quickly became fascinated with this perplexing, warped and brilliant director. His earlier work, such as Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, presents an interesting mix of campy melodrama and brutally violent realism, which is interesting but somewhat jarring as the two formulas don't quite seem to compliment each other.

Lost Highway is a different kind of Lynch film, completely consistent in tone and (I would argue) coherent in structure and philosophy. I haven't seen Fire Walk With Me, but it's clear that Lynch took a major step forward between Wild at Heart and this one. Lost Highway moves slowly but steadily, weaving a sense of foreboding that doesn't let up even when the worst has apparently happened. The tension is unremitting, and even the humor (in a neat trick that is distinctly Lynchian) does nothing to alleviate the sense of menace.

There are a lot of different interpretations of the story, but the one I find most convincing is that we are watching the main character's mind construct a fantasy to protect him from the knowledge that he killed his wife, while an uglier but more honest part of his mind tries to shove that very same fact into his face. There is not necessarily a right answer, but I think this one explains a lot of things very elegantly. In any case, there are plenty of clues in the film to help you form a coherent idea of what it's about, and as long as you enjoy this sort of challenge I think you'll enjoy Lost Highway as well.",1302393600,,1528,4.634686346863469
894684,5,630451087X,"After many years of watching David Lynch's films, I've finally stopped trying to figure them out. It's not that I don't have theories about his movies, it's just that I get more enjoyment out of simply watching them, and accepting Lynch's ghastly universe in all of its dreadful glory. LOST HIGHWAY is the finest example of neo-psycho-noir I've ever seen. I like it as much as (perhaps a bit more than) MULHOLLAND DRIVE and BLUE VELVET. The characters are perfectly dark and mysterious, the setting is bleak and convoluted, and the atmosphere is suffocatingly ominous. Lynch's use of violence and sensuality, stirred into his black stew of ""the unknown"" make for a wonderful, creepy experience! I never tire of his stories because they are each a unique puzzle-box to play around with. HIGHWAY is another milestone in Lynch's career...",1292889600,3,835,5.014388489208633
894685,2,630451087X,"David Lynch is one of those directors who you can't help but admire because he really understands his own aesthetic so well that he is genuinely `himself' at all times.  Every time you turn on a Lynch film it is unmistakably a Lynch film, and so you have to appreciate the level of technical skill and focused energy taken to craft these cinematic nightmares (that is not meant in the negative).

While I consider Lynch a true auteur and a borderline genius, and I take great pleasure in declaring works like `Eraserhead' and `The Elephant Man' true masterpieces, there is a fine line that Lynch can walk, to where his directorial choices can either serve for the greater good (like the aforementioned) or where they can get in the way of his true genius (like `Inland Empire').

Sadly, `Lost Highway' can join `Inland Empire' as `lesser Lynch'.

It's not like there aren't moments here to be cherished, for I don't think there is any Lynch film that is a complete disaster, but `Lost Highway' (for me at least) is his worst film.  It feels jarringly incomplete and unfocused.  Lynch is the master of layering elements that don't necessarily go together in order to create a macabre structure that, in the end, `goes together', but his weaving here doesn't create a fluid product.  The meshing of the two worlds (a gimmick he doesn't know how to stray from) does create the desired dreamlike affect (something that made `Mulholland Drive' work so magnificently) and instead creates a confusion that doesn't etch itself out enough to invest itself in the audience.

You don't feel a part of the film.

Lynch's films can at times feel like amalgams of one another, all of them sustaining an emotional monotony that either adds to the narrative (like it did so splendidly with `The Elephant Man') or takes away.  The opening segments of `Lost Highway' feel stilted due to the zombielike direction.  Sure, it feels like Lynch, but it also feels lazy and underdeveloped.  The films second half picks up pace, but they two halves don't make a whole, and you need that revelation to tie them together.  While Lynch supplies it, it doesn't really connect like it should.

For a film that contains jazz, parties, sex, gangsters, transmorphing, murder, adult films and a video obsessed executioner; `Lost Highway' feels kind of empty.

Thankfully, there is a big redeeming factor here, and that comes in the form of Patricia Arquette.  I don't normally find her to be the best actress in the world, but her performance here is actually quite stunning and wholly necessary to the propelling of the plot.  She tackles a slew of personality fluctuations with ease and layers her multiple characters with enough differences and similarities to make them feel real.  It's a shame that Pullman and Getty are so vacant and numb, and it's a real shame that Robert Loggia (who is normally just plain brilliant) is reduced to a variation of Dennis Hopper's, Frank Booth, from `Blue Velvet' (one of those performances I just didn't get).

Oh well, Arquette is amazing (award worthy amazing) but the film itself is kind of pointless and not worth seeing.

I hate saying that.

This is Lynch.

NARRATIVE

Pete Dayton a young attractive man works as a mechanic during the day and goes partying at night, and hangs out with Sheila a girl from the nighbourhood. His parents are nice and calm and do not intervene much in his life. One day at work he meets this girl, Alice Wakefield who was in the company of Dick Laurent a customer wanting to repair his car. She caught his eyes ogling her and she comes alone in the evening. Thus started a sexual relationship between her and the mechanic. Now Alice is a porn star in a film business owned by Dick Laurent, and is plotting to leave this business and run away. But before doing that, she wants to steal money from Andy, an associate of Dick. So she found Pete the innocent youngster (19 yrs) who would assist her in her plot. She leaves the backdoor open while she is having sex with Andy to let Pete sneak in and hit Andy. Pete hits Andy and Alice steals the money. But Andy wakes up only to fall on the edge of a coffee table and gets killed. They run away and get married and Alice dies her hair black. But they are pursued by Dick Laurent who fancies Alice and cannot let go. Alice and Pete now married have an average suburban house and change their names to Fred Madison and Renee Madison. A few years later, Dick finds out about them and threatens them, so Alice (now Renee) agrees to renew her relationship with Dick and sleeps with him at Lost Highway Motel. Eventually, she plots with Pete (now Fred) to kill Dick when Dick falls asleep after having sex with her. Pete (Fred) now in his mid-twenties, waits in the dark for his wife to leave the motel and sneaks in and kidnaps Dick and drives him to a desert cabin and kills him. He returns home and even before getting in he informs Alice that Dick is dead.
From then on, Alice (Renee) who always had a penchant for criminal thinking leads a normal life, and Pete (Fred) who was an innocent youngman cannot escape the nightmares of the murders he committed because he loves Alice (Renee). He has frequent nightmares and he suspects that his wife who was a porn star and who had sex with anyone to get what she wanted fast, is infidel to him with anyone anytime. Driven by his deteriorating psychological condition, he murders her one night. The police investigates and arrest him, and he is sentenced to death by electric execution. During the execution, his mind is revealing falshes of his memories about what happened.

THE PLOT
The plot is an artistic representation of the narrative. The film starts at a point where the tension between Pete and Alice is highest, and thirty minutes or so Pete kills Alice and is sentenced to death. He is now waiting execution in a prison cell and when is taken to be electrocuted, all the other events start flashing in his head, starting with his life as a 19 year old working as a mechanic and dating Sheila, and so on. All the other elements that are not directly part of the plot are there to improve the artistic presentation and to add style. For example, the strange man with the weird face is Pete's evil sub-conscious reminding him all the time about the murders he committed. There are moments when David Lynch gives away signales, for example when this strange man tells Pete/Fred that her real name was not Alice, or the photo when Alice and Renee show up only to have only Renee left after Andy is killed. Which means that Alice will now run away and use another name.

Now reviewers can watch the movie and enjoy it as I did. It is a piece of art.",1283731200,2,3744,4.390489913544669
894690,4,630451087X,"Lost Highway is a movie that allows you to make a choice. Is it a Twilight Zone Movie in which you're dealing with soul transference & time travel? Could be? A Faustian bargain? Are you dealing with the roving inner eye of an insane mind? That was my choice & this review will reflect that choice.

The movie starts with a man & his wife whose house is being video taped from the inside. Is this being done by an outsider, evil spirit or is this the act of a sinister plan inside the home? I say inside job. If you're messed up enough to shoot video of your place to deceive yourself or your mate, putting it in an envelope & leaving it outside is no biggee.

What a lovely relationship they have too. He's freaked out & she's subservient enough but also obviously has the quiet confidence to plan her way through her troubles. Enter now, the best character of the movie only listed as ""mystery man"", Robert Blake. He's never gone anywhere he states, that he wasn't invited. Sounds like an evil spirit all right & remember they've talked before. In my book they've talked many times, like each night as Pullman roves the corridors of his insane & escape proof mind.

You get a murder, an arrest & a conviction. So neat & tidy plus added stress on an already bent mind. What happens in Pullman's cell at night is the key to whether you go towards Twilight Zone or insanity. Is Bill Pullman & Balthazar Getty the same man? Is Pullman actually in prison or is he in the prison for the criminally insane with a real body played by Getty.

I chose Balthazar Getty as the real & very, very, sick, person in this movie. Pullman is Getty's uber-human. Pullman is what Getty wants to be. Not an auto mechanic that lives at home with mommy & daddy, BTW- great cameo's here on ma & pa, but a musician in a nice apartment with a super hot lady that belongs to one of the BIG people in his little man's world. I mean Getty covets everything he perceives as being above his station in life, the car, the women & in the end the will to be violent to obtain his desires.

Now for the lady, & thank you Mr. Lynch for Patricia. This girl wants the money & there is nothing she won't do to get it. Attracted to power like a drunk to alcohol she has finally realized that if she has the money she can be the power, not bask in someone else's. Now look at how they meet. She did sorta make the pick herself. She picked that punk as soon as she saw he couldn't take his eyes off her while she was still in the car. Lamb to the slaughter she thinks, but this isn't Body Heat even though Patricia puts out tons of that.

Actually I believe the movie is pretty straight forward once you decide if you're watching Rod Serling's Twilight Zone or if you're seeing inside the mind of a little man with big dreams that went terribly awry & landed him in the prison we can't escape, our own minds.

The men's dreams are trashed. The woman's dreams are killed. Even the Big Boss is pancaked out of his dream in the desert. The only winner here is ""Mystery Man"" who never goes where he's not invited. Where does Mystery Man come from & where does he go to? Whose call does he answer? Isn't it to be expected that as the police close in for the capture, no O J here, Mr. Getty begins to revert back to his other identity. Sorta like Psycho without the maternal leanings so no insipid weakness.

I give the movie 5 stars for entertainment value as you can get sucked in here and wake up 2 hr's later thinking only 25 min's passed. Lot's of misdirection.
I give Patricia anything she wants. I'll be Getty for her.
The rest of the cast gets 4 stars except Blake who gets 5.
Movie rating is 4 1/2 stars.
A nice trip down the lost highway of my mind.

Seems Hollywood either toons the Warden, the guards, the convicts, the media or the whole system. This show used the other method which is- just don't show it.",1279324800,,3980,4.260927152317881

Neo-Noir? I'd spell it C-R-A-P. The script flew out of the car, onto the highway and wasn't numbered. So they just stapled it all together without checking with anyone and you got this.

It was like watching a Charlie Sheen look-alike acting badly. At 82 minutes into the movie (a miracle I go that far into it) I was contemplating pulling out the DVD and using it for target practice at the range. Robert Loggia played his oft-repeated tough-guy mobster role, Gary Busey in his pre-druggie days, and Patricia Arquette as the spaced-out, airhead girlfriend of Mr. Eddy (Loggia) who likes ""doing it"" with the Charlie Sheen guy (I forgot and don't care what his name was). Robert Blake played a hideous little imp with flour makeup.

I truly believe these type movies are made for when you are either drunk or stoned; or both. At 107 minutes you'll either be laughing out loud or screaming for the director's head. I'd be like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, and have the Key Grip punch out the Director and then I'd improvise and have the rest of the crew punch out the writer(s).

Bill Pullman figures prominently in this film as a sax player who, through a particular psychological breakdown finds himself inside another man's world, feeling his feelings, and thinking his thoughts, many of which are of violent actions approaching murder.

To attempt any reductive rationale for the Lynchian style is to do a great injustice to both the director and viewer, since part of the dynamic of the film is based on our own perception of reality and how it is visualized in the film.

894730,5,630451087X,"Many talk about Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire as Lynch's mind melters, but this was the first film of his (other than Eraserhead) to really push the surreal, nightmare, ""dream"" ""logic"" that has permeated his films since (except for The Straight Story).

I was always a fan of Lynch's, but this film was a genuine surprise when I saw it.  Siskel and Ebert, who I admired very much when I was young but became disillusioned with them in the 90's when they recommended practically everything they saw, dissed this film.  The poster in the newspaper said ""Two thumbs down!  Siskel and Ebert.  Two more great reasons to see Lost Highway."".  Well, that was the keeper.  I saw it, I loved it, and it's Lynch's most underrated film.

Everything thing in this film works, from the great, complex script, to the moody, intense cinematography, to the great sound design (and exemplary use of music).  It was made in 1995 during a decade not known for artistic films.  It has great performances (especially by Patricia Arquette and Robert Blake).  It has great scenes, like the one where Bill Pullman ""calls"" his own home from Blake's cell phone, and Blake is at Pullman's home.  It still creeps me out.  It's also the last film by Richard Pryor, who was confined to a wheelchair due to his multiple scerosis.  The film never lets up in its intensity.  There are no dull momments in its 135 minute running time.  You will be transfixed.

This film doesn't make any literal sense, but if you surrender to the nightmare of it, it's pretty damn awesome.  It's one of Lynch's most memorable, mesmerizing works, a great precursor to his later ""nightmare"" masterpieces, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.",1232841600,,1692,4.795847750865052

894732,5,630451087X,"There are those cinema experiences that will always stay with you for various reasons that sometimes even have little to do with the movie you saw, as I will always remember seeing ""From Dusk till Dawn"", at the midnight hour, not just because I loved the movie, but more so, that during that night in the next few hours the relationship with a girlfriend was initiated. Sometimes a movie is stuck in your memory, because you were deeply moved by it because you totally identified with one or several characters, while another movie you will never forget, because you had such high expectations and eventually so few of them you felt were met.

Seeing Lost Highway in the cinema for the first time was such an unforgettable experience but not for any of the reasons mentioned above. From the opening scene that showed me Fred's face lit by inhaling cigarette, I knew I was about to go on a journey that I had never before undertaken as a viewer, as it turned out to be a journey through a landscape, that never before was seen in any movie in this way, the landscape of the subconscious, in this case the subconscious of the character Fred Madison. Never before or since an exploration of this realm was undertaken in such a brilliant way and shows it as reality. Let's be honest, we all know how much our behavior, thoughts and feelings are determined and directed by it, so it's really quite astonishing, that this journey has been made so rarely.

It's not my intention to analyze the movie scene by scene, however great the temptation as I could talk about every scene for about an hour, but that's not the point. Everybody should get lost in their own fashion on this highway, which the movie travels and which proves to be so fateful for Fred Madison. I'd like to help the viewer along just a bit though and so there are two aspects I'd like to expand upon: `Moebius strip' and `Psychogenic Fugue'.

As is shown in a famous Escher painting a Moebius strip is a strip of paper of which both ends are tied together in a circle, which is however twisted in the middle, causing both in- and outside of the surface to be identical. This relates to the structure of the movie, where conscious-subconscious, fantasy-reality, have become entangled to such a degree that they have merged to the point of indistinction. It also is a structure that has no end and no beginning, only determined by identical starting and end point before a new loop is initiated.

Naturally there are multiple interpretations possible concerning this movie, but what is certain is that the medical condition, named by Lynch himself in relation to this movie, which plays a crucial part is ""psychogenic fugue"". This medical term refers to a state of mind in which the person suffering from it deals with a traumatic experience, let's say the violent death of a wife by their hand, by creating a construct for itself, a different personality with a different history and a different life trying to suppress reality.

It should be obvious that a combination of these two aspects applied to one character would signify a highly confusing life with no hope of escaping the vicious circle, as the personas the character adopts every time (the start of each loop) cannot prevent that in the end reality always determines the outcome with only the one escape to the next persona, as we can see at the end of the movie when Pete (Fred's alternate persona) has become Fred again and is being chased by the police, reality seeping in, starts to 'morph' again and this way initiates the start of a new 'loop'. Ultimate hell I'd say.

In Fred's 'fugue' existence Pete is the ideal made flesh for a man like Fred, who no longer wants to suffer from impotence caused by suspicions of infidelity on his wife's part. Pete doesn't have a wife, but dumps his girlfriend in favor of a mistress, femme fatale Alice, 'stolen' from underworld figure Mr. Eddie, known by Pete as a regular of the garage where he works as a mechanic. As Pete, Fred seems to have a firm grip on the reigns of his life, but that's only on the surface. Pete, as it turns out, is being completely manipulated by Alice and Mr. Eddie, Dick Laurent in Fred's reality who he suspected of the affair with his wife Renee, the blond version of Alice, is now the victim and threatening potential doom on Pete's and Alice's relationship and just as present between them as Laurent was in Fred's mind in his relationship with Renee. The only one not fooled by Fred's game with fantasy and reality is the so-called 'Mystery Man', a unique performance by Robert Blake, who, as a kind of Mephistopheles knows all about Fred's dark impulses, symbolically recording all his actions on video (also a comment about the relationship between the artist and his art, but that's a different discussion). As in the Faust legend of old he only goes where he's invited and he embodies the inescapability of Fred's doomed fate, the nexus where fantasy and reality touch. It's no coincidence that the metamorphosis from one persona into the next takes place in his cabin.

I do consider 'Lost Highway' to be the, hopefully temporary, pinnacle in Lynch' work and those that are willing to travel along this road of mystery, violence and sensuality, I wish them a similar spellbound experience that I have had so many times on this road to perdition.",1225929600,2,5352,4.663135593220339
894772,1,630451087X,"The movie starts out with a man (Bill Pullman) that suspects his wife (Patricia Arqhardtospell) of cheating on him. He finds video after video proving that it is happening. After a bit into the movie, she ends up dead and the man ends up in jail.

In jail he has a strange dream the night before he disappears and is replaced by another man entirely! It is assumed that he transforms, it is not shown. The 19 year old that replaces him (Getty) is released and the original man is never mentioned again. There are hints though that Bill Pullman's character really exists.

There is a tie in between the two characters that is not seen until near the end. It is almost as if the man that wrote the 'Lost Highway' book wrote 2 books and smashed them together. 2 different men, with 2 different lives that exchange lives for a week or so in time.

The 19 year old is a mechanic working for a mobster Mr. Eddie (Loggia) who is really Dick Durant. Mr. Eddie's wife (Patricia Arqhardtospell) has an affair with the 19 year old and looks very similar to Bill Pullman's wife. Not just because they are played by the same actress, but because they are supposed to be ties between Bill Pullman and Getty.

The style of this movie seems to be a series of artistic shots that would be better off as photography. Shot after shot has 5 seconds of a person standing doing nothing. Then they do something, and stay there for 5 more seconds from a different angle. This movie is very easy to fall asleep to until the 45 minutes into the film when the character Peter Doyle comes into play.

894776,5,630451087X,"My favorite of all David Lynch's films, ""Lost Highway"" isn't a film for everybody.  It's a dense and complex creepshow with many of the same elements that made ""Twin Peaks"" ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" so rewarding to watch.  And, like those projects, ""Lost Highway"" demands patience and a willingness to forego a traditional linear narrative to gain access to the beautiful, brutal, and disturbing worlds that Lynch creates on film.  You have to open up your mind and just go with what's happening onscreen, otherwise you'll be hopelessly lost and/or frustrated. By the end of the movie, you'll either be enlightened or you won't, but it's a helluva ride anyway.

In ""Lost Highway"", Bill Pullman does a brilliant reversal of his often bland, reassuring screen persona, performing the role of Fred, a cuckholded, middle-aged saxophonist living an unhappy American Dream with his sexy, faithless wife, Renee (well-cast Patricia Arquette as an auburn haired vixen).  Fred's dream becomes a nightmare when he discovers that someone is apparently coming into his home and filming him and Renee as they sleep. After meeting a particularly creepy Robert Blake at a party, things go downhill quickly.  Following an almost Kafkaesque chain of events, Fred finds himself accused of a particularly horrific murder.  Tried, convicted, and sentenced to die, he finds himself locked in solitary confinement in a prison that seems to have no other inmates.  The only others present are two guards (one played by musician Henry Rollins) and an elderly doctor.  After experiencing severe headaches and convulsions, Fred awakens in the cell as Pete (Balthazar Getty).  Dumbfounded as to how the much-younger Pete awakened in Fred's cell, the authorities ship Pete home to live with his biker parents.  Back on the job at the auto mechanic shop, Pete meets up with an aging gangster (wonderfully played by Robert Loggia) and is introduced to Alice, the gangster's mistress (also played by Patricia Arquette--this time as a blonde kewpie doll). Suffice it to say, it isn't long before Pete is slinking around with Alice in back-street motels, and you know that the gangsters aren't far behind.  Carnage ensues, with some erotic layovers for the lovers, before a bizarre, beautifully filmed finale in the desert.

Aside from the expert performances and the gorgeous, haunting cinematography that has become a Lynch trademark, the soundtrack really stands out--it's probably the best of any of Lynch's films.

I avoided buying the previous 'import' version due to the explicit consumer complaints regarding the quality of the transfer.  My potential concerns regarding sound and picture quality were allayed upon viewing this new U.S. release.  It looks and sounds quite good, bearing in mind the source material.  The visual style of the film is sparse, simple, and high-contrast -- rendered with Lynch's ""vague America"" aesthetic.  The image maintains its integrity and the deep blacks employed do not suffer from noise often seen in older or poor transfers; the colors are also solid for a DVD.  The sound design is suitably moody, ambient, dark, evocative, provocative, and intersperses a fairly eclectic mixture of songs with the invaluable contributions of composer Angelo Badalamenti.  There can be a slightly irritating difference in volume between Patricia Arquette's near-whispering and, say, Rammstein -- but this is not an uncommon problem with DVDs.  Otherwise it sounds pretty cool.
I'm not going to review the film but I will say the complete lack of special features is more forgivable for such an unusual, ambiguous, and artistic film as Lost Highway than any other movie I can think of right now.

To that time, I had never seen filmmaking that was so bizarre, dark and twisted - yet strangely compelling. I have been a David Lynch fan ever since and have enjoyed (if that is even the right term) all of his subsequent films.

I first saw Lost Highway many years ago as a rental VHS. A friend and I sat in silence through the entirety of the film and after the credits rolled, we both turned to each other and said ""what the hell did we just see?"" After much discussion, we decided that we didn't really understand the ""plot"", but somehow the movie had mesmerized us anyway.

That is the magic of David Lynch - the ability to open up little glimpses into the dark corners of our subconscious and draw us in with a look or a phrase or an image from the character on the screen. His movies will bounce you around like a pinball and in the end leave you wondering and guessing, but isn't that a refreshing change from most of the ""crap"" that passes as filmmaking these days?

I watched Lost Highway again (for the second time) today and confess I am no wiser about anything other than maybe some subtle details. I did, however, enjoy the movie every bit as much as the first viewing - and maybe more.

894841,5,630451087X,"It's not a popular position to take considering all the reasons people admire his other films, but LOST HIGHWAY has always been my personal favorite of David Lynch's since its release in 1997.

I never tire of watching it.  Even by its maker's standards, it's a powerful and unapologetically dark concoction which can inspire a really gut-level, intuitive, sensory response from a viewer.

The film manages to capture the rare and delicate mood I can only describe this way:

You wake from a terrifying, cryptic nightmare.  You can't decode it.  Your heart is racing.  With the morning's progress, the terror fades, but certain scenes remain indelibly in your mind.  You mull them over in the context of 'reason.'  Sometimes a feeling you have while 'awake' takes you back to these scenes...and they appear different somehow.  You think you begin to understand.  But then as quickly as your understanding comes, it vanishes again.

When the next night comes, you startle yourself with a realization: in its own way, that nightmare world is as seductive and beautiful as it was scary.  Something strange, almost alien in you wants to go back.  But you can't dream the same dream twice.

Except when it's a film.

And that's what LOST HIGHWAY is.

In a career full of startling images, music and sounds, it easily contains some of Lynch's most incredible ones.  The visuals are like a symphony of red, black, pale yellow, neon and smoke.  The textures of Los Angeles are captured with a dream- and life-like detail which are both familiar and exotic.  The sounds and music are enveloping and alluring one minute and pulse-quickening the next.

The performances are strong all around, with even the most minor characters played with notes only Lynch and his carefully chosen actors could hit.

Although Lynch has also explored his non-linear storytelling side in other, more popular efforts, I think he struck the perfect balance between the abstract elements which challenge and the accessible pleasures of the film-noir genre in this particular story.  LOST HIGHWAY veers more toward the all-out assault of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/INLAND-EMPIRE/dp/B000QQFKYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">INLAND EMPIRE</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ERASERHEAD/dp/B00003CWPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ERASERHEAD</a>, rather than the more glammed-up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MULHOLLAND-DRIVE/dp/B00005JKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MULHOLLAND DRIVE</a>, but I think it also feels truer to itself, and so more resonant.

EDIT:  Now that the actual DVD product is out and I own a copy...I can say that the DVD is good for the following reasons: the picture and sound, as expected, are tops.  This is probably the best homevid version which exists, at least until the Blu-Ray version comes out (there are no plans for one though that I am aware of currently).  There are some web reviews that claim other transfers of it on non-Region 1 discs are superior, but based on the screen captures I have seen I think they are wrong.  This does look to me like the Lynch-approved version, with colors truer to the film as I remember it in theaters.

There are also chapter stops, a welcome surprise given Lynch's dislike of them and their exclusion on some of his other DVDs.

And the bad: no extras.  The expected 10-angle interview never appears here (why?) and not even the excellent original trailer, which you can probably YouTube if you're curious.

Anyway, it's still a great film and the best way to watch it outside of a good print in a movie theater, so...

894894,5,630451087X,"David Lynch explores the boundary between the internal world and the real in evocative, engaging and atmospheric style. thisis one of Lynch's most approachable movies - on the level of Mulholland Drive and a little more complex than Blue Velvet.

Evil - so authentically personified by Robert Blake (last seen on trial for a real-world murder) - is resident in the heart and mind of a saxophonist brilliantly played by Bill Pullman (who was ""Lone Star"" in Spaceballs) and Patricia Arquette (last seen as the popular television series ""Medium."") Robert Loggia is the gangster. Here their talents are not wasted, and neither is one minute of film. There are also some other actors. As always with Lynch there is brilliant humor if you appreciate his type of humor. Most memorably, the instructional driving lesson administered by the gangster Robert Loggia. The plot is simple like most Lynch plots once you understand that things experienced are not necessarily real. As a Lynch-O-phile I deciphered this one on first viewing, which doesnt mean that there are not remaining puzzles. The real point is to be carried by the tides of a story told with both emotional and intellectual clarity, and with a relentless momentum leading to a really terrifying collision of worlds real and unreal.

Skip the last paragraph if you prefer to figure things out your own way.

**
The saxophonist marries a former porn star. He recoils at sex with her, a problem amplified by jealousy when he sees her with a former friend/lover. Evil, personified by Blake, is invited into the house. Brutal murder, arrest,conviction and retreat into delusion (Lost Highway) and the delusional persona of young auto mechanic Eddy follow. However, the veil of delusion is pierced first by recollection of his own music, then by the reappearance of his murdered wife as gangster's moll. More things happen...

I watched it two nights in the row. After the first viewing I knew I'd missed a lot - but also knew I wanted to see it again. ""Whatever I understood was beautiful, whatever I did not understand was probably even more beautiful"" and I wanted to find it. What helped me to figure it out (or at least I think I did) were two films I kept thinking about when watching LH both times: Bunuel's ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" and Lynch's Mulholland Drive. In Bunuel's film the main character's object of desire is played by two very different actresses. In LH the man who desires is played by two actors (Bill Pullman as Fred, the musician - in the amazing performance and Balthazar Getty as Pete, the mechanic). The object of their desire is Patricia Arquette, gorgeous Renee the Brunette, Fred's wife and seductive Alice the Blonde, the fire of Pete's loins. Is this the same woman? Are they twins? Is she a dream? That's for us, viewers to figure out. And we are on our own - Lynch knows but he would not help. I also think that in LH Lynch tells the same story (if he ever tells the stories) or paints the same painting like in MD: the story of gut-wrenching love, desire, obsession and jealousy. You can destroy the object of your desire but you will never be able to kill the love and longing for it. It will come back to you in your dreams; it will haunt you as long as you are able to feel. It will live in your soul and your head and torture you as long as you are alive. And you will never be able to have it.

I think Lost Highway is Lynch's masterpiece, absolutely perfect film on all levels. It goes on the top of my list a little ahead of MD because the original idea belongs here. One thing I don't understand: why MD which is secondary to LH is so universally praised and well known while LH is considered lesser movie or even the failure. For me, LH is a masterpiece, a perfect film where everything works: visuals, sound (one of the most amazing soundtracks ever. I never thought I'd say this: I liked Marylyn Manson's version of I Put a Spell on You), acting - Patricia Arquette -there is some child like innocence in her that makes all men in the film completely mad about her.

How does Lynch do it? What is his magic touch? How does he make his actors do what they do? Who dictates to him how to arrange perfectly every single frame so nothing is missing and everything is on its place? In the film so claustrophobic, there is a breathtaking aerial shot of the highway with two cars racing - it is beauty itself.

That's what he had to say about his enigmatic underrated gem:

""There's a human condition there - people in trouble, people led into situations that become increasingly dangerous. And it's also about mood and those kind of things that can only happen at night. You can just take that and run with it your own way.""

""There is a key in the film as to its meaning. But keys are weird. There are surface keys, and there are deeper keys. Intellectual thinking leaves you high and dry sometimes. Intuitive thinking where you get a marriage of feelings and intellect lets you feel the answers where you may not be able to articulate them. Those kinds of things are used in life a lot, but we don't use them too much in cinema. There are films that stay more on the surface, and there's no problem interpreting their meaning.""

""Death Valley is so beautiful. It just goes on forever. I like the idea of shooting in Death Valley - just the name. It made perfect sense for Lost Highway.""

On the lighter note - You actually can learn something very important and useful from Lost Highway - please be polite to the other drivers on the road - you never know who the guy you just fingered turned out to be. :)",1177027200,,3771,4.331444759206799

894900,3,630451087X,"This flick was weird, and rather mind-numbingly so, even for a David Lynch film! It took me three watchings, half a bottle of tylenol (for the headaches it gave me) and reading about three or four interviews online with Lynch himself wherein he offered the only explanation that he could (something about a ""psychogenic fugue""...?!?!) over this film and it's bizarre circuitous plot for me to even begin to figure out just what the heck is going on throughout half of it! Even now, I'm still not enitirely sure that I'm totally getting this or any of Lynch's films for that matter. And in my opinion therein lies the whole point/problem with Lynch's films. Meaning simply that maybe all of us spend far too much time trying to decipher what his movie's are all about, and that ultimately they may very well be nothing more than big elaborate jokes that he is playing on all of us in that no one but him will ever actually ""figure out"" his movie's and their supposed ""meanings""...if they even have any at all! Though with that said I still find myself somewhat of a fan of the man's films as they are brilliant in terms of the production values (i.e. unique and meticulous set designs, the awesome, weirdo soundtracks, the costuming, the lighting etc.). I just decided some time ago to quit spending so much time thinking about his film's as it's pretty much futile in my book, and instead I just enjoy them for the wild, trippy mindf***s that they obviously are. And 1997's ""Lost Highway"" is one of Lynch's best examples of this. I highly recommened it to most people, however, those who aren't familiar with the man's film's before this one might want to try the more commercial and less psychologically mind-bending films from earlier in his career entitled ""Blue Velvet"" and ""The Elephant Man"". Oh, and I should add that the soundtrack may very well be one of the best ever created! Kudos to Trent Reznor and Lynch regular Angelo Badalementi for that one.",1173484800,3,1958,4.678260869565217

If you know Lynch's style, then you know this will be a real thinker, or as I like to call it, a mindf***.  The film is like a puzzle that will keep you guessing all the while you're watching it, and keep you thinking long after it's finished.  I still have not been able to complete the puzzle myself.  The puzzle seems much more accessible than Mulholland, though.  I believe Lynch's works are like poems that are meant to be interpreted.  Whether there is a certain interpretation he hopes you come to, that's another story.  But I think with Lost Highway you can come much closer to the truth than Mulholland, which is why I rate it as his best so far(though I haven't seen his shorts, Eraserhead or Wild at Heart; they're on my list).",1171497600,2,935,4.364161849710983

894964,5,630451087X,"This to me is Lynch's darkest work. It goes headlong into the psyche of a mentally ill murderer, and with few exceptions thats where you stay. Just when you think you're coming up for a bit of air another black wave crashes down on you and pulls you back under.

 The pacing doesnt feel good, things feel either labored or abrupt. But thats probably Lynch trying for an effect. The symbolism doesnt feel as concrete or focused in this film as in his other works, but again we're seeing things through the eyes of a madman.

 There also seems to be no sign of redemption or resolution, the lead character is doomed without the possibility of escape. Its hard to feel particularily bad for him either, he is a murderer afterall.

 Therefore the only emotion you can expect to feel in this film is fear and loathing so to speak. Though I do have to say in the first 30 minutes the fear and paranoia literally leap off the film.

 Interesting film that pokes and prods you in ways you don't understand while watching it. Though it certainly isn't easy to watch. If most modern film bombards us with empty sneering positivism this film is the exact opposite. It lifts up the rocks in the dark places of mans psyche and holds it unwaveringly in our faces.

 Even though this film is hard to watch and understand, you get the feeling like its bad tasting medicine. That seeing this extremely dark film is somehow cathartic. At the very least the film is a strange trip with no handrails to hold onto and no ground beneath you.

895022,4,630451087X,"""Lost Highway"" is undoubtedly one of David Lynch's masterpieces, but the current versions offered for sale are completely sub-par.  Pan & scan, muddy picture, 2-channel sound and no extras--this is shabby treatment for a film with so much to offer!  If you're a Lynch completist, a huge fan of the film, or just plain cheap (the prices offered for ""new & used"" are so low they're almost as insane as Lynch's imagination) then I suppose there's no stopping you from adding this to your cart, but please use discretion.  When this is finally released in a form that's better suited to discriminating film fans, then ""Lost Highway"" is a must-buy.  Until that day, however, hold your horses, cowpokes.

The film itself is a surreal mind-blower with a moebius-strip narrative.  A jazz musician (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Patricia Arquette) recieve a series of videocassettes on their doorstep which show a cameraman invading their home and going right into their bedroom.  The police can't do anything until Arquette is murdered, and the most obvious culprit is Pullman.  He goes to jail (watch for a cameo by punk rock muscleman Henry Rollins) but one night something, uh, ""strange"" happens and in the morning the cell is occupied by a young man (Balthazar Getty) with no apparent connection to Pullman, so he's released.  His character is a grease monkey in an auto shop run by the late Richard Pryor (in what is probably his final film role, and displaying symptoms of his MS--to disquieting effect).  Getty gets involved with a psychotic gangster (a very twisted Robert Loggia) and his moll (Arquette again...hmm...).  Meanwhile, there's a mysterious, maybe supernatural character played by Robert Blake(!) who's just plain creepy, and a subplot involving a porn film which gives Lynch fan Marilyn Manson (!!!) a very brief cameo.  The last half hour or so of the film defy explanation, and maybe even interpretation, but the theme of identity, as in state of being, seems to be in question.  The ""self"" is ultimately unknowable, and given to shifting at a moment's notice.  The ending leaves us off where we began, leading to the sort of head scratching that even a full bottle of Head & Shoulders won't help.

It certainly helps if you're familiar with the films of Bunel and surrealism in general.  Lynch seems to be drawing from a part of the unconscious that even Freud couldn't have guessed at, though.  The fact that he's an avid practitioner of transcendental meditation might give some insight, but not much.  Nevertheless, themes of power and cruelty that Lynch explored in ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" are continued here, and the new themes of identity are continued in ""Mulholland Drive,"" though each stands just fine on their own terms.  Lynch likes the idea of a mystery with no solution (this frustrated both network execs and viewers with ""Twin Peaks"") so in the journey of ""Lost Highway,"" getting lost is half the fun.

Still, if you just can't wait until a superior edition comes around, you're better off renting instead of buying.  When a better edition comes along, you can also knock up rating to five stars.

Why do they think true abstract thinkers cannot get over a relatively small technical detail and get to the point, which is how can this tale of fragmented human existence relate to me??????  In particular, the murder scenes of the wife are particularly grainy and are flashed briefly on screen.  This does not seem a coincidence to me.  It actually adds to the mystery to not ""really"" see the action.  Viewers are required to use their imagination and experience to make sense of this piece of work.  Perhaps, a flawless transfer of bright, sharp images would satisfy some, but I feel that the grainy look of this film complements the grating feel of the twisted plot and the jarring, discordant, alternative rock soundtrack.  I love David Bowie's I'm Deranged opening and closing the movie; this is spiritually uplifting.  I had the soundtrack before I saw the film.

Therefore, to be really useful, I suggest that the film is about the obsessive nature of alpha males who live life to the nth degree and never really pay too much for that privilege. Being chock full of testosterone has it's rewards and punishment.  Lost Highway has a strong supernatural aspect that is fine if you believe in things supernatural, whether it's Jesus, white magic, or the Devil.  Compare Angel Heart with Mickey Rourke for the devilish theme and dual identities.  Lost Highway is spooky and about a real segment in life that basically, ""only comes out at night.""  There is also the feeling that if you somehow escape your destiny, at best, your ending is just prolonged, and you are what you are no matter what.

Consider these possibilities: the yellow brick road, the stairway to Heaven, or Lost Highway.  Pick one and be on your Journey.  David Lynch has given us a blue print/road map for the Lost Highway (full-tilt lust) that should illuminate the pathway for those ""choosing"" to travel there.  The same is true of Saint Paul and God's stairway to Heaven, or Hollywood culture's get-rich-quick schemes on a yellow brick road.  We have all these choices for where we can go and how to get there.

I have been warned by Lost Highway, and have no desire to go there.  Nor do I want to ""escape"" my destiny.  Thank you David Lynch.  Arguing the shoddy DVD transfer (a matter of taste and opinion) is totally irrelevant to my needs.",1132358400,4,2503,4.692660550458716

I don't know if the film is actually supposed to be as gritty as it looked but some the less its poor picture quality and the audio was impossible to hear the dialogue at times and then the music comes on which blasts the speakers so loud that you have to hold the remote the entire film and adjust the volume though out.  At one point i had my tv completely maxed out and couldn't hear the dialogue and then at another point i had it at the lowest setting ive ever had it because of the music.  Poor sound editing or poor dvd?

If you liked blue velvet and the elephant man then you can skip this one because aside from the gratuitous Arquet nudity this film had few redeeming qualities.

895127,5,630451087X,"The films of Lynch are symbolic, metaphoric, atmospheric, and poetic indeed. Lost Highway is no exception. I read the LH FOUND rewiew, and while I agree with some points of it, I can say it leaves out alot. It is rare that Lynch divulges his motivations in a clear manner when discussing his films. But in an interwiew taken not long ago, Dave did admit one thing- that the films Lost Highway, and the Twin Peaks franchise occur in the same world. And while I will state herein that there is no singular meaning to any Lynch film, I have watched it enough times to write an informed opinion on Lost Highway, and the main character Fred Madison.

Fred is, as stated in another review, a disgruntled husband. His wife(Renee) is disinterested in him, her past as a porn queen still haunts her. Fred knows it and feels powerless to do anything about it. It is not off-par to say he wishes her dead, right from the beginning of the film. This sets off the metaphysical chain of events created by the now ""invited"" Blake(Mystery Man), culminating in the creation of a tangent or alternate universe, in which Fred is able to kill his wife, escape prison through transmutation, kill his wife's porn associates, learn the truth about his marriage, and travel back through time to kill his wife's lover, and set in motion the chain of events that occur throughout the movie. The whole film takes place in this tangent universe, and is initialized by the message over Fred's intercom, which is Fred's future self telling his present self that ""Dick Laurent is dead."" We then hear a car speed off, and the police sirens enter chase and vanish out of auditory range. So in a way, Fred has already killed his wife, but it hasn't actually happened yet!

The film becomes linear for a time. Fred plays his musical gigs as his hatred grows, unknown video tapes of their house and persons show up on a regular basis. They call in police to investigate, to no avail. Fred's increasing hatred of his wife then allows the mystery man to materialize into Fred's life, first masked over the face of his wife after some particularly bad sex, and then in person at a party, in an etherial exchange that should tell the viewer that the mystery man has metaphysical powers over time and space not clearly explained visually. It is after this encounter, that Fred does indeed kill his wife, and the transition between his home and the police station does indicate a mental incapacity for remembering events. Fred foreshadowed this to the police earlier in the film by saying he likes to remember things the way he remembers them.

Fred is now incarcerated on death row, a place he needs to escape from if he is to complete his new-found destiny, a destiny which he samples through a hallucination of a boathouse exploding in reverse(reverse space-time continuom). Once again, the mystery man, in control of time and space, physically combines Fred into the body of another person, Pete Dayton. And Since Pete is not Fred, at least physically, the jailors are forced to release Pete to the custody of his parents.

Pete was picked by the mystery man, because Pete has a direct connection to the people Fred intends to kill. Pete works as a mechanic at the shop where Mr. Eddy(Dick Laurent), the porn king gets his cars fixed. Here is where the movie becomes not so linear in structure. Pete begins to relive the affair he had with Renee, and Renee appears to him as Alice(Renee w/ Blond hair), simultaneously as a memory, and a spritual projection controlled by the mystery man who is trying to lead Fred to Dick Laurent. Slowly but surely these memories begin to pull Fred's personality out of Pete, who manages to kill one of the porn people, and scuttle off into the desert with Alice to meet the mystery man at the boathouse which explodes in reverse. During Pete and Alice's final love act at this point, Alice reminds Pete that he will never have her. This is because she is dead- Fred killed her. And this moment not only draws Fred out of Pete through memory, but it also brings Fred back through time to a point in time before any events of the movie have occured, and Pete Dayton is thereafter erased from existence. This is also part of the event that happened in front of Pete's parents that they will not speak about. They saw Pete vanish into nothingness when he came home with the mystery man, before he wound up in Fred's jail cell.

Fred now ends up at the Lost Highway Motel, where Renee and Dick Laurent are having sex. Renee leaves afterwards, and Dick Laurent is then accosted and killed by Fred and the mystery man. The mystery man then whispers something into Fred's ear. Fred then goes back to his old house, and says through the intercom ""Dick Laurent is dead"", closing the chain of events in this tangent universe like the mystery man told him to do in that whisper. Fred then flees from the police who he believes have been tailing him(they are the remnants of his earthly memories), and out onto the Lost Highway, Then Fred too is erased from all existence, and his tangent universe created by the mystery man, officially ends with the credits.

Remember this is only my opinion. I am not saying I am right or wrong, or anyone else is right or wrong. My gut tells me that Dave meant for these events to be actual occurences, rather than a psychotic dream. But you decide for yourself. Also the film Donnie Darko works in quite the same fashion, if you are looking for a comparison.",1111104000,6,5480,4.586734693877551

895132,5,630451087X,"I usually don't blast other reviewers, because everyone is entitled to an opinion, but c'mon...

I can't believe the reviews I've read about this film.  I read about people calling this film garbage, largely because they don't understand it.  You know what?  Go out and rent American Pie 6 or Rocky 22 if you're into a movie that requires no thought or study!  The facts are as follows:  Movies relying solely on reality are about as shallow as pop rock, hotel room paintings and Chuck E. Cheese.  For a movie to truly be a ""suspense,"" it needs to be be intriguing, and YES, hard to follow.  I hate to sound intolerant, but if you hate this movie, you're stupid.  Plain and simple.

David Lynch, in his later films, delves into dream worlds.  Both LOST HIGHWAY and MULHOLLAND DR. prove this fact.  The reason people get lost is that they can't decipher what is a dream and what is real.  Guess what?  In our own derranged minds, many of us find the same problem in our twisted lives.  Did I dream that, or did it really happen?  If you watch this movie twice, you will see the obvious clues which tell you when the narrator is dreaming and when he is not.  ALL of Lynch's films have a main character, a protagonist, and an antagonist...just like driectors and screen writers have been doing since the early 1900's.  People have been making psychological thrillers since the 1930's and they are just as hard to follow as some of the current films.  What people don't understand is this:  if you're making a psychological thriller, you need to be original and raise the bar.  Lynch CLEARLY does that here and with Mulholland Dr.

The story centers around Pullman's character.  He is suspicious of his wife, who he believes is cheating on him.  He freaks out, gets involved in a murder, and in a dream state, he imagines himself as Getty's character--a fictitious, make believe world.  The real treat of this film, the GEM if you will, is Robert Blake's imaginary character.  The scennes involving him and the video tape sequences are the creepiest thing I have ever seen in my life...and I love horror films.  Trust me--you will be creeped out forever.  The images are burned into your brain.

895175,4,630451087X,"You know, nine out of ten times that I show this movie to friends of mine, the reaction is usually pretty much the same: the dude who made that movie is nuts. Well, in all reality, Lynch didn't go nuts, Lynch just goes lynch on ""Lost Highway"", easily the most Lynchian of his works since his debut, the surreal ""Eraserhead"".

Gone are any forms of conventinal storytelling like there were in ""Blue Velvet"", ""Wild At Heart"" or ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", replaced by a surreal landscape where little makes sense and little is supposed to. The film is seperated into two parts: a much darker and intricate story about a jazz musician(Bull Pullman) who is being stalked by a crazy dude in white face(Robert Blake, showing signs of things to come as it were) and who kills his wife(Patricia Arquette). Or maybe he doesn't. I don't know.

Then the film shifts focuses(I won't say how because that's one of the crazy things about it) to a car mechanic(Balthazer Getty) who ends up having an affair with a mobster's girlfriend(once again, Patricia Arquette).

Now this all seems to be easy to follow and get, but this is just the set up for the movie, where Lynch takes his stab at film noir done by a crazy scientist. The movie seems to be perfectly understandable and normal at one point, but twists and turns so much that even after twenty times viewing, you are still lost. And that's the fun of a David Lynch movie. Everything is left up to your own interpretation of what's going on and what's happening, and not one person is wrong or right. Everyone can see ""Lost Highway"" differently.

The mood conjured by Lynch and his scorer Angelo Badalmenti is excellent, as it is in many Lynch films, and the modern music supplied by NIN honch(and laziest man in showbiz) Trent Reznor gives the film a modern twist(at least for the time it came out) without taking away from the decidely 40-ish tone that the movie conjures.

the film is TOO DARK, loaded with emotions mixed with LACK of emotions, horror, and sexuality driven to sickness.

which all sounds great, if only the director realised that people who are watching the movie didn't come here to get PUNISHED, and want to enjoy the film as well.

it could have been better if lynch would break the ""tense atmosphere"" once in awhile, so that the viewer could breath.

not to mention the film is way too LONG, so that at a point you just want it to end.

895177,4,630451087X,"Lost Highway could be 'Ultimate Lynch'.

The film is more a dream than a coherent story or meditation on anything.  It doesn't make much 'sense', but I don't think the point is to make any sense.

The film plays with the ideas of time, and of being in two places at once. In the beginning, Bill Pullman is Fred, a sax player in LA married to Renee (Patricia Arquette). Their marriage is...icy at best. One day they begin getting strange videos in the mail that suggest someone is getting into their house at night and taping them and their surroundings. Eventually, they get a tape of Renee's slaughtered corpse, and soon Fred gets thrown in jail.

One day, the guards walk by and notice someone else is in Fred's cell.  It's young Pete, a mechanic.  Since they can't hold him, he gets released and is soon back living with his parents (including Gary Busey) and working at an auto garage.  He meets up with a good customer, wiseguy Mr. Eddie, who also makes porn and has a hot number with him: Alice, also played by Patricia Arquette. And along the way, there's a bizarre little 'Mystery Man', played by none other than Robert Blake.

Yeah. Anyway, the film is heavy on style and atmosphere, the colors, the photography, the music (Angelo Badalamenti's score is complimented by NIN, Marilyn Manson, David Bowie, and Rammstein tracks) are fantastic, lending the film a deep, cold feel to the bizarre events.

I'm convinced that to overly scrutinize the plot is to miss the point. I'm not sure there is a point. This is some other world, where 'our' rules do not apply, and we can only be left to ponder the surface questions. Are Fred and Pete the same person? Does everyone have two different parts to them? What happens when they are separated, and how to do they communicate with each other?  It's doubtful you'll seek this film out by accident. If you like Lynch even a bit, it's his must-see film next to Blue Velvet. It's flat out bizarre. I still like it, though can't cite specifics.

Anyone saying otherwise are maybe hoping to generate interest in a new edition of the film on DVD or something, which I certainly wouldn't be against if it contains some nice extras.
If you're already a David Lynch fan then I won't preach to the choir because you already must love this film.  However, if you're new to Lynch's work, you must not expect anything 'normal' to happen.  He usually breaks the rules of linear story-telling.  This effort is no exception.  The film, according to one theory, is one man's nightmare dreamt from inside the cell of a penitentiary, but it is time displaced and characters switch roles.  The nightmare is based on what we can only assume is real events that involve the main character murdering a young woman whom he loves, but who is tied to a nefarious character named Mr. Eddy.  It's hard to tell who Lynch sees as the real villain here - Mr. Eddy or the girl.
Knowing the dream/nightmare premise, though, you can stop wondering what's going on and just enjoy the ride.  If you're of the Freudian psychoanalysis school of though there will be a lot to keep you focused.  If not, there's still enough linear filmmaking here to keep you enthralled as in a 'normal' movie, but there's enough strange weirdness (Robert Blake's character for instance) that tips you off that this is all a really wacked out nightmare.  The fact that it is probably based on actual events that the main character is remembering in the dream makes it all the more chilling.",1088640000,13,1659,4.589830508474576

895223,4,630451087X,"Lynch's film, like a Mobus strip, keeps you on one narrative track and renturns you first to a mirror image of what you've seen, and then back to the beginning.  On one level it's a horror film whose power (like that of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" or the oddly effective ""Blair Witch Project"" film) stems from its refusal to dispose of the things it dredges up.  On another, it's a meditation on desire and obsession, and an eerie commentary on the power of film and representation.

While it lacks the ultimate hopefulness of ""Blue Velvet,"" this is in some ways a tighter and much freakier film.  One of the most terrifying moments in recent cinema is the party scene, where the Pullman protagonist chats with the Robert Blake demonic figure who is both standing in front of him and at his home at the same time.  Lynch transforms characters into mirror images of each other, breathes weird life into the sunlit horror of L.A. with subtly perfect music, and throws in a few perfectly comical moments to boot.

This is not a happy film, but it is riveting and a technical masterpiece.",1087084800,,1084,4.590673575129534
895224,4,630451087X,"The title, Lost Highway, by itself lays ground for cognitive dissonance as Lynch presents a puzzling cinematic journey into a vivid nightmare.  In this nightmare the audience is to follow Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) who is coerced through visual hints into jealousy and suspicion as his wife acts peculiarly and mysterious videotapes of his home appear on his door step.  The nightmare intensifies as Lynch presents further suggestive indications that Fred's wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), is having an affair with a friend of hers.  However, as soon as the audience feels somewhat comfortable with the story Lynch throws a wrench into the cerebral machinery by adding a new idea.  An idea that drives the story in a different direction that generates further confusion as the nightmare snowballs.  Lynch tells a bizarre story about envy, love, jealousy, and revenge that reminds more of a painting than a film as the cinematography and mise-en-scene are extremely suggestive.  Lastly, the soundtrack is exceptionally well selected as it complements the dark theme of the film and helps to provide a terrific cinematic experience.",1086998400,,1132,5.29608938547486

It just didn't stand up to the hype... at all. It just looked like a B movie the whole way through. The beginning was so boring and drawn out that i could bairly tolerate it. i was VERY tempted to stop the video and return in without rewinding it due to the fact that it was so boring... and i havnt stopped watching a rented movie in years. this one was very close. some of the acting was pretty poor too... like, unfortunatly, ole hank rollins... ive seen him do much better than what he did in lost highway. the only reason i have this film more than one star is the fact that the director did do a good job, dispite the poor quality of the film istelf. as for the story line, i didn't like it at all. i like strange movies, but i just didn't care for this script at all. it did pick up towards the end a bit and i did like the pastey camera character, so that did help get the second star. My main beef with the movie was the lack of backround sounds and music. the film wasn't all that bad during the times when there was some sort of music in the backround.
art? who am i to say. all i am saying is that i didn't really care for this movie and would never suggest it to anyone i know, and they would trust me because they trust my film reviews for the most part. i may not know art, but i know what i like.. and i just didn't care for this. it just, how do you say..

 Always is interesting to see a movie made by the experimental director David Lynch, so ""Lost Highway"" has interesting parts, however, sometimes it gives the sensation that the only person in the world that is pleased with the events that appear on the screen is David Lynch, and that is a bad thing because the movie fans are the main reason why the movies are made. It's good to be creative, but you got to show a plot once in a while.

 But putting that aside, ""Lost Highway"" is an interesting exercise of film experimentation. The highlight may be Robert Blake as ""The Mystery Man"", he is really a creepy character.",1067126400,,812,4.86231884057971

Just listen to the song by Hank Williams.  I heard for the first time a year and a half after I saw the movie and it put the whole thing into perspective for me.
I saw this years ago in the theatre, so beyond that, all I remember are beautiful colors, Robert Blake calling himself on the phone (and looking just like Richard Benson - The Avenger!), and a stunning Patricia Arquette.  However, I'm game for another viewing after these reviews.
If you're just starting out with David Lynch, a good jump off point is The Elephant Man and Wild At Heart, then segue into the wierder stuff with Blue Velvet and Eraserhead (that movie makes me ill), maybe even Dune if that's your cup of tea.",1064361600,3,849,4.367088607594937
895308,5,630451087X,"Pigeon-holing Lynch as a noir director is perhaps a mistake, given the cramped definition many want to hang on the genre.  But with Lynch, you have a talented director showing just what is possible. (Polanski did the same with Chinatown.)  But with Lynch lines are blurred as image, dream, and story converge, and then flip and twist in unexpected ways, assisted by the director's use of both wondrous and disturbing imagery. To add to the layering is one of the best soundtracks for a movie I've heard in some time. Thematically each song (Lou Reed, Smashing Pumpkins, David Bowie, others) plugs into the movie, with all of its twists and turns. Partricia Arquette turns in a superb performance as the femme fatale(s). Her audition for Mr. Eddie to the crunching sound of Marilyn Manson's ""I Put a Spell on You"" is one of those scenes that burns into the mind as an unforgettable and dark tableu rather than as a piece of film. Arquette's moment, which is mostly visual, is as effective as Jane Greer's appearance in ""Out of the Past"", but more dangerous since the stakes are, if possible, higher: a man's mind and soul as opposed to simply his life. She is the object of obsession, she is archetype, and she is, as she tells her lover, unobtainable. Indeed. But she makes for one gorgeous nightmare.
Lost Highway may, given time, be viewed as the perfect distillation of Lynch's vision. (And I'm a big fan of Blue Velvet.) It is certainly one of the darkest rides into the American night.  Though the journey is a psychological one, Pullman's (Fred's) electrocution death at the end pulls all the dark threads, internal and external, together.",1062374400,8,1645,4.764912280701754
895309,1,630451087X,"I wasted 2 hours and 8 minutes of my life, which I'm never going to get back, watching this film. And for what reason? None. I didn't enjoy the film, I couldn't understand it, and that creepy bug eyed guy is going to give me nightmares. Up until now my worst film was `The Last Broadcast', but at least that was somewhat understandable. This is my new worst film. There is NO point to this film. Maybe some smart genius could work it out, and tell me there's some `hidden meaning' behind it all, but I'm sorry, I could have done something a lot better for 128 minutes.
I've never heard of David Lynch before, but he may need some therapy, though.
This film is very reminiscent of a silent movie - there's not much dialogue, and there's heavy focus on the imagery. I prefer more dialogue. Imagery does not explain certain scenes in this film. At certain parts, you can almost hear the music to the Twilight Zone playing - not literally, it just felt like it should be added over.
Patricia Arquette plays a mysterious brunette & an ice cool blonde, and manages to appear naked five times throughout the film, for no apparent reason. And have sex in the full glare of a car's headlights?! Whatever turns you on. And another chick gets naked too. Definitely a movie for the guys, I think. Girls, buy something decent.
When the video gets played, you almost expect the phone to ring, and tell you that you have seven days before you die - like `The Ring'. Did no one else see this? Very similar. Same bad quality video picture!
This film could have been cut in half, still kept in all that was necessary, and I still would have been bored. At 128 minutes, it was too long.
I expected the trailer to be better on the DVD. I've seen better teasers than that. It explained nothing about the film, and it just repeated the credits at the beginning. And how BORING were those beginning credits? The `lost highway' drove me mad, they could have turned a corner or something!
Giovanni Ribsi (better known as Frank, Phoebe's brother in `Friends') has a very small role in this, and is virtually unrecognisable with black hair - but you recognise the face pretty quickly if you're a fan of `Friends' or have seen him in `Gone In 60 Seconds'.
Gary Busey (Point Break, Lethal Weapon) also appears in this, looking very much like an ageing hippie! I recognised his voice instantly, and had a laugh at his appearance!
The transmogrification was very confusing. People have said Patricia Arquette playing two different characters in the same film was confusing. That wasn't so confusing. One was brunette, the other was blonde - not that hard to tell the difference.
Don't see this film unless you're a masochist. If you're eyeing it up in the shops, put it DOWN, and choose a GOOD movie.
Shawn, next time choose a better film, sweetheart. Definitely one of your worst choices. And you say I have bad taste in films?!",1061337600,6,2898,4.54302103250478

895311,4,630451087X,"Well, this was probably my favorite movie until Lynch's Mulholland Drive came out.
It's the sort of title where, if you're thinking about buying it, you've probably already seen it. You either love it in the way you love your favorite dream, or wish you hadn't wasted two hours of your life. For that reason, I don't see much use in discussing this exceptional film.
As for the DVD itself: Don't expect extras.
No problem there--a psychological masterpiece such as this deserves to stand on its own. Extras always sound nice, but they usually consist of some director with an overly-inflated ego trying to make his work sound like something more than a diversion while munching popcorn. Usually, the popcorn is better.
Lynch allows his movie stand on its own. It not only stands, it walks, runs, and grabs you by the collar. Great stuff.
Some reviewers noted a lack of sound quality. Probably, they have better sound systems than I do, and mine isn't all that bad. In a nutshell, the Lost Highway DVD is *far* better than the video release in terms of sound. I didn't get to see Lost Highway at the theater, so my first spin of the DVD was like hearing the movie for the first time. Wow. The soundtrack brings a new dimension to the movie.
The only reason I knocked a star off the rating was for the image. The overall image quality is pretty good, better than my VHS copy, but the decision not to present it in wide-screen was a bad one. No...it was an ignorant one. The film was clearly shot with a wide-screen ratio in mind. I don't know what the heck people were thinking. As my dad would say, ""They weren't.""
To me, sound and vision are the fundamentals of a film, with ""plot"" a distant third. (If plot is your main concern, grab a book--print media won't hurt you!) Without widescreen, you miss a couple of things, but more importantly, certain shots just don't look the way they should.

895365,5,630451087X,"The first thing I couldn't help observing was that Lynch doesnt make movies to please the conformistic and intellectually un-stimulated audiences. Very rarely do you find people who take their work to a level where they do not genuinely bother about the impending financial ramifications of their art.
The brilliance of Lynch lies in capturing a distinct post-modernistic aura while not heeding to that familiarly compulsive habit of modern day directors to opt for stereotyped symbolism or complicated logic, but concentrating instead on surrealistic visual images that nevertheless are immensely appealing to any mature viewer with a broader sense of aesthetics. Those who find it hard to appreciate his highly refined sensibilities and harp merely on the obviosly chaotic storyline are not appreciating his art in a holistic manner.
IMO, this is much better than his later work, Mulholland Drive, in terms of the sheer delightful lushness of the situations, the adept and smooth pacing and last but not the least, the inimitably stylized nature of his direction.

She isn't obviously a true Human being and several clues reveal that in the movie. She is also cheating on him and he suspects it. Also there is another person in the movie (Short Guy with a Pale Face) which really would be considered the Devil or a deciple of. His face was also seen in the film emerged with hers..one can only figure they are the same person because they are never seen in the same frame. Fred goes to Prison for the murder of his wife which he didn't commit. But for some reason he is being tortured by the devil you can only suspect. He tranformes into a guy that was killed on the highway the night before and was released from prison. Renee comes back but only this time her name is Alice to reak havoc on his existance again. Does Pete/Fred fall for her again ? Yes he does and he ends up right back were he started! He kills several people for the obcession of her and later finds out she really doesn't exist. Also he finds out who she really is in the cabin. The key to this movie is ...Haven't we met before? At your House remember? Basically this is a struggle of Obcession over a woman that is extremley sexy and attractive. Obviously we have all been there but I think not to this extent. This movie just shows that when you worship something more than your self ..were it can get you. The movie has a lot of twist and turns and unexplained portions and questions to be pondered over.

895402,5,630451087X,"David Lynch spent most of the early- and mid-1990s in a kind of torpor.  After the cancellation of Twin Peaks and the (deservedly) cool reception to ""Wild at Heart,"" Lynch turned to other projects, including his art and another television show that never really made it past the pilot stage.  In 1997, he returned, arms swinging, with ""Lost Highway,"" and it was certainly a project for which the wait was worth it.
Bill Pullman (whom I normally cannot stand as an actor, but he turns in a killer performance here) plays Fred Madison, an avant-garde jazz saxophonist who suspects his wife (the beautiful Patricia Arquette) is cheating on him.  Someone keeps leaving plain brown envelopes on their doorstep, with videotapes of their house inside.  When one of the tapes shows the couple sleeping, Madison calls the cops.  That night, at a party, he meets a Mysterious Stranger who convinces Madison that something's very wrong.  He doesn't know the half of it, and the rest of the movie is an unraveling of Fred's life, in more ways than one.
Some of the typical Lynch stuff is here: mysterious people who seem to be some kind of supernatural force, invisible characters, and characters that `morph' into new characters.  It's also a tribute to the film noir style with some amazing scenes (the desert seduction scene is one of the sexiest ever committed to film), and borrows many elements from ""Vertigo,"" a film that was truly ahead of its time.
""Lost Highway"" may seem like it's weird for the sake of being weird, and it's the kind of movie that appeals to those snobby filmgoers who like to brag about figuring out artistic mumbo-jumbo, but it's not.  Lynch, who typically says very little about his films, has given people two clues about ""Highway"": it's set in the same `universe' as Twin Peaks, and that the film is essentially a `psychogenic fugue,' a term described in the DSM-III-R as a state where someone under immense stress suddenly adopts an entirely new personality, with new memories.  With that in mind, the film isn't terribly difficult to figure out, if you are familiar with some of Lynch's recurring symbols and his style.  Each Lynch film has a certain theme, and the theme here seems to be how one person deals, psychologically, with his life when he discovers it was not what it seemed to be.  To say any more would ruin the fun, though, except to add that ""Lost Highway"" is almost a mirror image of ""Mulholland Dr.,"" so if you understand one, it's not difficult to understand the other.  I should also note that, personally, I found ""Lost Highway"" to be a (slightly) better film than ""Mulholland,"" but still believe ""Blue Velvet"" is Lynch's best, so that might offer some kind of measuring stick for those familiar with his other works.
Like Lynch's other films, ""Highway"" isn't for everyone, but it offers the same kinds of rewards for anyone who wants to engage himself or herself in following the trial of clues ""Highway"" offers.
Final Grade: A",1034812800,10,2971,4.78125
895403,5,630451087X,"Lost Highway is a great movie. It starts with a saxophone player and he and his wife getting broken into and videotaped while they sleep. This saxaphone player is then arrested for the murder of his wife. In prison he morphes into Pete Dayton, an auto-mechanic who has an affair with a mobster's mistress. That's, more or less, the basic outline.
 I loved this movie. It was VERY creepy and totally mindboggling, 2 things typically found in a Lynch film. The 2 things that really stuck with me were the dark, gloomy, shadowy atmosphere, and of course robert blake as the ""mystery man"". It also really sticks with you because your constantly thinking about it, trying to contemplate it. The great thing about Lynch is that his films don't have a definitive meaning. He obviously had his own meaning, but your supposed to have your own thoughts and your own interpretation.
 All in all, this is a beautiful film. I would strongly reccomend it to any REAL film fan. Very thought-provoking, so go and rent it. NOW!!!!

However,  the Canadian DVD release is probably the worst DVD I have ever seen.  For starters it is in 4:3 ration instead of widescreen 16:9.  Secondly, the film transfer is terrible.  It almost looks worse than VHS.  Truly a terrible picture.  Sound is just fine although nothing special.

895405,5,630451087X,"I recently saw Mulholland Drive and found it to be a bit too contrived from Lost Highway. This film is Lynch's best since Blue Velvet. The cinematography alone is enough to keep you watching. But the sheer weirdness of the film, the disjointed plotting and great performances make it a doubly rich treat for the mind and senses. Once again, Lynch plays with themes such as innocence, good, evil, the corruption of innocence, transformation, paranoia, dreams and nightmares. Glimpses of secret worlds that hide just behind the mundane.
I'll leave the finer plot points to other reviewers. Here's what stands out. The film sticks with you for days. Like any good Lynch movie we find yourself asking ""what did that scene mean?"" for days after you've seen the movie. You walk away with one interpretation of the film by find yourself with a different one later, after you've though about it some more. You've felt compelled to tell other about this movie. You may have even gone on the Internet to get other people's opinion of what the film is supposed to be about. You want to buy the soundtrack. Lost Highway had the best soundtrack of any of the Lynch movies. Mulholland drive didn't live up to the standard set here. Robert Blake was sincerely scary - more so than the Cowboy of Mulholland Drive - although I found him interesting too.  Noir! Nobody does is better today than Lynch! Surreal Film Noir!

The English soundtrack is included in Dolby 5.1, and (unlike the Canadian edition) it's in W-I-D-E-S-C-R-E-E-N.  Another review of this disc convinced me to purchase a copy from Amazon.de.  Surpisingly, Amazon.de recognized my Amazon.com login!  And placing the order was pretty easy, even though my German is almost non-existant.
The picture and sound quality are good (though not exquisite), and the disc even has some extras - which, on Lynch DVDs, are usually scarce. The sound track does appear to be slightly out of sync with the picture, but that could be an artifact of converting PAL to NTSC on the fly.  What I wouldn't give for a multi-standard widescreen monitor...
The film itself is a dark psychological study similar in many ways to David Lynch's more recent Mulholland Drive.  It's about obsession, murder, guilt, secret identities, and the demons that often drive people to desparate, destructive acts.  Don't try to make sense of it the first time through; just go with it.  Then, on repeat viewings, look at it as a symbolic map of a man's mind stressed beyond the breaking point.  Apply a little Jungian psychology, and its meaning should, if not exactly come clear, at least brush past you close enough to touch.
Lost Highway is an underrated masterpiece of psychological horror, and not to be missed by fans of David Lynch!  C'mon, you can get through the German...",1030579200,99,1502,4.786821705426356

I sat down and watched this with my girlfriend who kept recommending Lost Highway to me, so finally I managed to watch it, and just like Lynch's other movies, it takes more than one sitting to make any sense out of the entire thing.  The storyline can be explained by the Amazon review, but there are parts that feel too drawn out, and the largely incoherent storyline just adds fuel to the fire.  However, there are quite a few redeeming qualities.  Lynch's style over substance direction is at it's peak here, his best since Blue Velvet, the casting is superb, and the dialogue is great, and sometimes just plain hysterical (especially at the scene where Robert Loggia's character expreeses his views on driving to someone who was tailgating him).  While Lost Highway isn't as good as Lynch's previous Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and the recent Mulholland Drive, this movie is far from a failure.  The ensemble cast includes Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, Balthazar Getty, Robert Blake, Robert Loggia, Gary Busey, Henry Rollins, and cameo appearences by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez as a couple of unlucky porno actors.  The soundtrack is worth noting as well, featuring fantastic music by Manson, Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, Smashing Pumpkins, and Rammstein that help carry the film.",1027468800,,1417,4.953586497890296
895409,5,630451087X,"Of all David Lynch's movies I have seen yet (Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and this one), this was actually the most I was eagerly to watch (although I'm quite interested in his new apparent masterpiece ""Mulholland Drive""), since I am a huge Nine Inch Nails fans and always wanted to know why Trent Reznor produced the soundtrack. That was dued to the fact that he also produced Oliver Stone's 1994 underrated Natural Born Killers, which was a memorable soundtrack for a great movie. So I was in expectations this one could be a second part.
And it was. The movie is completely confusing, but doesn't lose its qualities then: it's strangely mind-blowing. Bill Pulman and Patricia Arquette do a good job here as a couple, but surely the oscar goes to Balthazar Getty, who plays Bill Pulman ""alter-ego"".
The movie's most intriguing hour, which Fred turns to Pete, is obviously a mention to psychogenic fugue, which is allowing yourself to changing identity to somebody else, believe you are somebody else. But the fuzz doesn't stop here: many things are complicated to understand, if possible to.
All in all, this movie deserves a 5 star in Spielberg's face, since it shows that it isn't necessary to have a high budget and good reviews to define a good movie.",1027036800,,1252,4.774193548387097

895451,3,630451087X,"David Lynch's 'Lost Highway', overall, doesn't make any sense but still isn't bad.  Be warned, this film does not have your standard kind of plot.  It is about an musician, Bill Pullman, who is suspicious of her wife's behavior.  He thinks she is sleeping with someone else.  Both seem psychologically depressed because they talk very softly and rarely smile.  Some strange incidents occurr and next thing you know, Bill Pullman is in jail for killing his wife.  Another bizzare incident occurrs in jail and Bill is transformed in a younger man.  What that you say?  Yes, you read that correctly.  The warden realizes Bill Pullman doesn't exist anymore so he releases the younger car machanic.
But, the warden has two guys spy on him after he is released.  The young guy goes through a bizarre sexual journey involving his girlfriend and Bill Pullman's wife.  Wait a minute, I thought she was killed?  Well, she was and wasn't.  His wife in the second half of the film has blond hair, but in the first half she had brown hair.  So in some ways, she is still alive.. I think.  Is is just me, or is 'Lost Highway' subliminally ripping off 'Vertigo'?  Remember how Kim Novak had blond hair in the first half and brown in the second half.  Who do you think you're fooling David Lynch?
Even though it doesn't make much sense, 'Lost Highway' has some really steamy sex scenes.  The color and lighting is perfect, bringing and erotic feel.  Lynch used two sexy ladies with nice breasts for our viewing pleasure.  Some may think they are exploitative, but they were done so well, I enjoyed every second of it.

895455,3,630451087X,"When I saw LOST HIGHWAY in the theatre I was glad to have the Lynch I knew and loved back on track. Although not as crystaline as BLUE VELVET or ERASERHEAD, LOST HIGHWAY is Lynch at his best: a filmmaker not at all concerned about story-telling, but one wholly intent on making pretty pictures. Of course, what most of us consider a pretty picture and what Lynch does are two different things. Still, with LOST HIGHWAY, and now with MULHOLLAND DRIVE, mystery, images, identity, and dreams again take the forefront. Who is who, what is what, and when is when, are all questions one asks themselves upon viewing this film. Trying to ""figure it out"" is an absolute exercise in futility, just know going into it that you're not going to get it, that pieces of the puzzle are missing, and that you can spend many frustrating hours trying to piece it together without any luck. For my money MD is a much better film than LH, hence the 3 star rating here, mainly for the fact that as utterly confusing as MD is it is more cohesive and subtle than LH, with much finer acting as well. Loggia's character is overwrought, and Pryor is an unfortunate novelty-casting mistake. Lynch, like Tarantino, almost strives to revive Hollywood throwaways, but in this case it just seems sad. Balthazar Getty is a poor-poor-man's Charlie Sheen, and only Pullman and Arquette seem to really grasp the futility of their character's lives. I defnitely enjoyed this as Lynch's comeback film (before he got supernormal with THE STRAIGHT STORY), but wouldn't trade in my Widescreen VHS version for the DVD. MULHOLLAND is the better film of the two, and I'm anxious to see what pops out of his head next.",1018915200,,1674,4.677966101694915

After the fourth or fifth trip out to the cabin in the sand, one welcomes the death of most of the leads as a cathartic end to the increasingly inane intrigue.

895458,4,630451087X,"It's difficult to review this film because of my opposing views about it. The first time I saw it, I absolutely loved it and thought it to be the best film I'd ever seen. The second time I watched it, it came across as a self-indulgent, average tale that had a few good moments but was overall a waste of time.
Taking on Freud's essay on the Uncanny, David Lynch concocts a bizarrely absorbing tale of doppelgangers, the unhomely home, and reversion to primitive fantasies. Indeed, it is so `uncanny' that the first time you watch it, it is deeply unsettling, and everything contained in it has the power to be creepy (it is incredible how scary someone with no eyebrows can be). What keeps you watching is that you have absolutely no idea what is going on, and yet the creepy vibe holds it together and keeps you desperate to reach the ending. Knowing how the film resolves (or frankly doesn't), however, takes a hell of a lot of the fun out of watching it a second time. Without the desire to discover how it all fits together, there is little within the stories themselves to entertain and enthral. Balthusser Getty, whilst good to look at (as he is, perhaps, Pullman's fantasy of a virile, potent young man), can't act worth a dime, and Bill Pullman's low-key performance prevents us from feeling any empathy with him. With no one to identify with except Patricia Arquette's femme fatale, whose character is so non-existent you can't really identify with her anyway, it is a fine work of intellectualism and great to talk about afterwards, but in terms of movie-making, it is dull, lacking in spectacle and entertainment, and has few of the quirks of, say, `Blue Velvet.'
I have given `Lost Highway' four stars, because of how much I enjoyed it the first time around. However, I would recommend seeing it at least twice before buying it, because I was amazed at how poorly I received it on the second viewing. The fact that the chronology of the film is kind of circular, unless it is all Pullman's fantasy, whilst stunning when you discover it, is merely illogical when you apply it to stringent scrutiny. Leaving more questions than answers is no bad thing, provided it is possible for the audience to come up with their own answers - in this case, it is more than impossible to answer any of the questions, so it is a thoroughly unsatisfactory experience. However, if all you desire is to see Patricia Arquette strip for the camera every few minutes, Henry Rollins hamming it up (as usual), and Bill Pullman miming some truly terrible saxophone-playing, this is the film for you.",1018569600,,2586,4.660831509846827

The first half of this movie alone would merit a ""greatest film of all time"" award from me.  In my opinion, the second half of the movie is a tiny bit weaker, and could have used a bit more of the flavor of the first half. That's not to say that the second half is bad.. it's just different.

895516,4,630451087X,"I have only watched this film once, but I have a couple of comments to make.  First, just as with ""Blue Velvet,"" this film is cursed with poor acting.  I had the dispiriting sensation that the actors were simply reading a script, and not even understanding it at that.  Totally inadequate for themes as sophisticated as Lynch's.  Second point, don't takes this film literally!  Other reviewers have made the point about so-called dream-logic, and there is certainly no rational logic afoot.  I noticed many interesting themes, such as Pullman-Getty and Arquette-Blake being just different aspects of the same person or dream character and the possibility of time being like a circular prison (Pullman leaves a message for himself at the end of the movie that he hears at the beginning), but the film is focused on none of those themes, for that in itself would make it too narrow to achieve the effect that it does.  This is one of the more cerebral films I have seen and treats its themes infinitely better than shallow and oxnoxious garnish like ""Fight Club,"" but even so I find myself alienated by the feeling that this movie is essentially insular and not really relevant to life in the way that all genuinely great works are.  An ambiguous effect, but I can now understand the obsession of the David Lynch-ites that I know.",1010880000,,1328,4.7685589519650655

It's hard for me to compare anything to Twin Peaks, which I believe is the greatest work of the 20th Century in pop culture(the TV series, not the movie).  Blue Velvet was also terrific.
Lost Highway is a mind blowing trip, and a ""thinking man's"" movie.  Great performances from Pullman, Arquette, Blake and especially Loggia, who I feel stole the film.

895532,5,630451087X,"Like the impossible situations in many Borges' short stories, Lost Highway presents an astonishing and uncanny tale in which David Lynch mixes his own obsessions with Hitchcock's Vertigo, Freud's Uncanny, and Bioy Casares' plays with time and space. Close to Borges, Bioy Casares short stories and novels deal with impossible plots where time and space are more related to the character's mind than reality. What is unbereable for Bill Pullman's personage, generates a mad trip to no place. Like in Bioy Casares' El Atajo (the Short cut), the character has to invent a complex net in order to accept his wife is not faithfull to him. Later, he has to accept more difficult things, so the plot responds to that. What makes this film extraordinaty (besides the usual Lightning and Sound excellencies)is the ""mirror"" structure, derived from the mirror images of Bill Pullman. At the beginning, he is in front of a mirror; later, before a transformation in someone else, he is at the mirror again; but this time, he takes the dark path by the side of the mirror. As a paranoid husband, he wants to be the husband and the lover at the same time. And the plot will pleased him in a strange way. As a mirror of this, Patricia Arquette's character will be doubled, being the wife and the lover of a mobster (Robert Loggia). The question the film tries to answer is: What do you have to do when you can't stand your wife betrayal? In which way you can control the woman you love? Is it really possible to set free the person you obsessively love? At last, like in Vertigo, there is no double (Madelaine and Judy are only one person). In Lost Highway, Lynch doubles the risk and he doubles both characters, the man and the woman. And this sort of Double Vertigo occurs in the placid yet sordid suburban paradise that Lynch has shown in Blue Velvet.
Regarding Sight and Sound, the DVD version is surely able to catch the atmosphere that VHS is not capable of. With some scenes almost completely dark, and with lots of whispers and strange sounds, DVD will show the intensity of this underrated film for those who did not see it at the theaters.",1008547200,,2133,4.630606860158311
895533,5,630451087X,"I found this to be one of Lynch's best movies, and also one of his easiest to understand.  Does that mean I'm more intelligent?  No.  The problem with this movie is people either praise it as an abstract puzzle that makes you think but can never be fully understood, or they hate it because it makes no sense.  This is not an art film, or some abstract jumble of images.  Don't let Amazon's review fool you; there is a plot here, and it's a very intriguing crime/thriller/mystery plot.  You don't need to be an artsy wannabe or a scholar to watch this movie, you just have to pay attention.  One line in this movie explains everything (it's near the beginning).  It doesn't hurt to know what a psychogenic fugue is, though (go look it up).
Anyhoo, this is Lynch at his BLUE VELVET best.  The first part of the movie is creepy enough to make anyone pull their blinds and lock their doors.  The second part of the movie is a great crime/thriller story.  This movie is for people who loved BLUE VELVET, MEMENTO, and even SNATCH, and who also saw what WILD AT HEART could have been.  This movie also has one of the best soundtracks ever made.

895534,3,630451087X,"I like David Lynch. He's one of my top-five all time favourite directors. BLUE VELVET &#8211; possibly his highpoint - was a great film that hit the mark on American suburbia. ERASERHEAD was strange, but comprehensible and fascinating. THE ELEPHANT MAN is a masterpiece. DUNE was, well, let's leave that one alone. WILD AT HEART won best picture in Cannes and deserved it too. TWIN PEAKS is just about the best television show there has ever been. But LOST HIGHWAY is just David Lynch trying to be too much David Lynch. It's too strange. It's too weird. It's, dare I say it, too elitist?
But LOST HIGHWAY is a fascinating film. This is mostly due to a wonderful score. Angelo Badalamenti deserves as much credit for any David Lynch film as Lynch himself. It seems that the one can not be without the other. Lynch has also managed to get an impressive amount of highly talented musicians to contribute on the soundtrack. Artists such as Lou Reed, Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, and The Smashing Pumpkins are all here. Goth rocker Marilyn Manson and the German industrial heavy-metal band Ramms+ein both made their fame on this film (whatch out for a cameo by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez in the film). LOST HIGHWAY also fronts great visuals. The film opens with a shot of a lonely stretch of road, in the dead of night, being lit up by the headlights of a car driving into the dark, with the Bowie song &#8220;I'm Deranged&#8221; playing in the background. And this sort of sets the tone for the film. Everything unfolds like a dream. The story telling is non-linear. It's fragmented. And it's, well, &#8220;dreamy&#8221;.
 It may seem that everything about this film appears to be &#8220;just right&#8221;. Strong visuals. Great music. But everything sort of falls through because there's really no way of &#8220;getting&#8221; the film. I've heard about a ducin or so different intepretations and, well, they all seem plausible. Some people seem to think that Bill Pullmann's character made some sort of deal with the devil (the mystery man being the devil) to escape from prison, and that is why the later mechanic as a lump on his forhead. Perhaps? I sort of lean to theory that Bill Pullmann, the mechanic, and the mystery man is the same person, and what we're really watching is Pullmann's desire to escape from his life and so he conjures up this mechanic to escape into; escapism does seem to be a favourable theme of David Lynch (as in ERASERHEAD).
LOST HIGHWAY is a film strictly for fans of David Lynch (or for people who in general like weird films). I like those types of film so I liked LOST HIGHWAY (albeit not as much as BLUE VELVET or WILD AD HEART). (...)",1006560000,2,2694,4.695560253699789
895535,5,630451087X,"This is an excellent movie. For many months I had posted a review here that got it totally wrong. I thought that the first character (played by Pullman) was a fantasy, and the second was real. (And I wrote it before Mulholland Drive came out.) Well, I saw Lost Highway again recently, and now I'm of a different opinion. Here's a few hints, but I'll try not to spoil anything.
The movie is chronologically linear, with one exception (the very first scene). It doesn't jump around in time like Mulholland Drive does.
It is a subjective movie, telling a story from one character's perspective; and when that character becomes delusional, the movie consists of his delusions. In the very last scene, however, you can see what is happening to the character in the real world: he acts it out while he's driving.
Pay attention to these lines: ""Sleep now,"" and ""We sentence him to death by electric chair."" And of course the one about Fred wanting to remember things his own way. The underlying story will be pretty clear to you.
This movie is eerie, the characters are mostly hostile toward one another, and you're left with an unsettled feeling when it's over. Some people don't like that, but if you enjoy The Twilight Zone you'll understand how a movie like this can be great.",1005609600,,1273,4.662222222222222
895536,1,630451087X,"One thing that really bothers me is when people claim to get something more 'abstract' and then are seen or see themselves as more intellectual.
  Lost Highway is one of those films where that happens. The movie is nothing more than a noirish episode of The Twilight Zone with a bunch of nudity and no explanations. It makes absolutely no sense unless you read about the movie beforehand to see an 'explanation' of the film. Yet, people still go on and on about how great it was. Despite the fact the already bad movie is filled with horrible, scarce dialogue. Horrible acting, general inaccuracies (huge archaic, gothic prison in LA, cops who can match prints while at the crime scene, false 'tidbits' used as fact to aid the story, etc.)and really obvious, obnoxious image systems.
  I've seen reviews that have said ""if you're into being spoonfed your story, don't watch this"". Well that's fine, but this isn't a matter of being spoonfed, it's a matter of someone trying to be so abstract that people feel dumb just because they don't get it. If you wanna look at something to find meaning in, go look at some abstract paintings, not a work of near unrelated sequential events that's filled with holes and is constucted rather poorly.
  If anybody besides the 'artistic' director known for being 'out there' did this film, it would be considered complete (...). But it's David Lynch, he's weird and therefor, this is great. At least that's how many see this (imagine if a plumber previously flawlessly fixed three broken toilets and then actually broke a toilet in half the fourth time he tried fixing one? Would you blindly praise his work because he did a great job the first three times).
  Don't buy this film unless you've seen it. And if you want to rent it, rent it at the library where it's only a buck. If you're looking for a great noirish thriller that actually makes sense and is told in an unconventional, intriguing way, go buy/rent Memento.",1005436800,4,1958,4.704678362573099

895570,4,630451087X,"LOST HIGHWAY is perhaps the most bizarre film David Lynch has ever directed, and that alone says quite a bit (considering that this is the man who gave us ERASERHEAD). But don't get me wrong. I'm all for films that makes you ponder and wonder about what it was all really about. So why only four stars? Well, first off, perhaps the film does deserve more. It might be more fair to give it a 4.5 instead of an even four. But I simply don't feel that this film matches up to David Lynch's other projects, such as WILD AT HEART and the excellent BLUE VELVET, and this may be the reason why I'm judging this film a bit harsher then what might be justified.
Because LOST HIGHWAY does get your attention (and it deserves it). I've got to give it that much. And if you have a taste for strange erotical and psychological thrillers with a surreal theme to them (did I just make myself sound like a psychopath?), then it's a fair to good chance that you'll enjoy this film. But it seems to me that David Lynch simply tries too hard in being ""different"" and weird. It's as if he doesn't want you to understand what's going on. As a viewer you'll only get the absolute minimum of information required to solve the enigma. The dialogues, for instance, resembles typical European art films where the characters only say one line to each other every ten minutes or so (ok, it's not that bad, but close). And a lot of elements in the film that seems to be of crucial importance, are just plain weird. And this will quickly seem pretentious and, dare I say, elitist.
Of course, everybody who has seen this film, has their own theory on what the film is about. Here's mine... Bill Pullman stars as Fred Madison. He's a mediocre musician who finds himself in a sort of existential crisis when he discovers that his wife, who's portrayed by Patricia Arquette, has been deceiving him (she's been starring in porn flicks). In a crime of passion, Fred kills his wife and is thus sentenced to death. On death row, Fred Madison decides for himself that this is not the way he wanted his life to end, so he ""dreams up"" (or rather ""escapes into"") a fictional fantasy world that he creates. A crucial line of dialogue in the film is when Fred Madison (when asked by a police officer why he doesn't like video cameras) declares: ""I like to remember things my own way. Not necessarily the way they happened"" So he turns himself into the handsome, young mechanist, Pete Dayton. But even in this fantasy world, Fred Madison can't keep the disappointments of his real life out, and things begin to move towards their end. And I guess that's about as much as I can say without spoiling the surprises. So as I see it, LOST HIGHWAY is a film about escapism. And this does seem to be a favourable theme for David Lynch. ERASERHEAD appears to be about the same thing (finding an escape from your everyday rotten existence).
The music in this film must be mentioned. It's great! David Lynch is widely known for being fanatical about mixing the sound for his films, and it clearly shows that the score is the result of a perfectionist. You could compare it to 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY. The musical score (albeit hugely different in mood and tone) possesses the same unparalleled quality. David Bowie contributes with the song I'M DERANGED (taken from his album OUTSIDE) which is used to create a dreamy feeling right at the opening (when we see the headlights of a car driving along a lonely stretch of road at the dead of night (David Lynch appears to have a fetish for roads and cars...)) Both the German industrial band Rammstein and goth-rocker Marilyn Manson (look for a cameo appearance by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez in the film) made their fortunes on this film. Trent Reznor (who produced the score) and Nine Inch Nails are also here. And Lou Reed contributes with the amazingly cool song, THIS MAGIC MOMENT. Of course, Angelo Badalamenti is also present to provide his smooth sounding jazz songs. It's truly magnificent!",991872000,,3995,4.5577190542420025
895571,5,630451087X,"I liked Lost Highway when I first saw it.  This, in spite of severe reservations (I HATED Blue Velvet).  Now, having seen it many times and read the screenplay, I am convinced it is an under-appreciated masterpiece.
The story:  Jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) has a vague notion that his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) is cheating on him.  Left on his front steps are a series of odd, anonymous surveillance-style videotapes of his house.  These tapes become more and more disturbing, as they get further and further INSIDE his house.  The last one is a doozy - it shows Fred having just horribly murdered and mutilated his wife.  In a jarring series of cuts, we find that he has, somehow without his knowledge, actually committed the crime.  He is convicted and sent to Death Row.  From there, things get stranger still, defying all logic...
Saying that the plot is meaningless is misleading.  While plot is certainly less important to Lost Highway than the skillfully woven mood of dread, it actually does make sense.  To understand it, one must make two assumptions:
1) What we are seeing is not literally real, but inside the main character's mind, and
2) that there IS a literal reality that is being represented, albeit through the extreme distortion of a mental breakdown.
Watch Lost Highway and think in terms of dream symbology:  if this were a dream of a repressed trauma, what would the dream be telling us about that trauma?  Surprisingly, a coherent and fairly consistent symbolic map of the ""real"" story emerges:  in dream interpretation, the house usually represents the dreamer him-/herself.  Locked away within it are dark secrets - like the repressed memory of Fred having murdered his wife.  But his subconscious mind tries to surface those memories through the symbolic videotapes.  Get the idea?
There is a lot more, including Jungian dream characters representing Fred's parents, his Shadow Self, his Anima and Animus.  If you've read up on clinical psychology, it helps.  But even if you haven't, Lost Highway will still talk to you, if you let it...to your subconscious, which will have no problem understanding the plot, even if the rest of your mind remains confused.

The picture actually seemed to be remastered a bit from the original video print (the fuzziness is mostly gone), and for some reason the movie didn't flow as clunkily as it had the other times I viewed it.
Lynch is an undeniably talented director, but if you rent (or buy) ""Lost Highway"" based upon his reputation alone, you might be disappointed.  The dream-like story (about a jazz saxophonist who may or may not have killed his wife, is put in prison, and mysteriously morphs into a young mechanic with mob links) lacks the smooth flow of events that was present in Lynch's excellent ""Blue Velvet.""  What's most distracting are the meaningless, drawn-out sex scenes that seem to come one after another in the second act; either Lynch really loved seeing Patricia Arquette naked, or he wanted to see how far he could push the movie's R rating.
All in all, ""Lost Highway""--even with its noticeable flaws--is better than most of the films mainstream Hollywood puts out.  Even if you don't like it, it will be hard not to claim this film  is a good conversation piece.",978393600,3,1744,4.832214765100671

The main character appears to be trapped in a continuously repeating time loop and intuitively knows that he is going through the same freakish nightmare - involving the brutal slaying of his wife - over and over again.  He can't escape and the film's denoument doesn't definitively resolve the mystery.  No one other than David Lynch could have made this film.  The viewer's only escape from the tension is appalling, graphic violence.  Robert Blake's character will positively give you the 'willies'.  He appears as a mephistopheles to Bill Pullman's character and alternatively haunts and then somehow helps him.  Honestly, though, I'm not sure I'll ever understand what is going on in this film.

THEY'RE ALL WRONG!

There is definitely enough cohesiveness of detail in this movie to rule out the possibility of it being either gibberish (the bad way of looking at it) or non-logical dream-like atmospherism (the good way of looking at it).  On the other hand, it doesn't /quite/ hold together in the way that, say, _12 Monkeys_ did in terms of plot elements fitting together to form a perfect structure.  In fact, it's somewhere in between--and there is no ""correct"" interpretation.  Is the movie about psychotic fugue, Faustian bargaining, or just plain insanity?  There's no way to know--Lynch doesn't give us enough clues.  However, the movie does hang together in a bizarre, intuitive way--much like _The Wind Up Bird Chronicle_ by Haruki Murakami, or The Firesign Theatre's _Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me The Pliers_.

My advice is, don't read the other reviews if you haven't seen it (they give too much away), but watch it twice.  The first time, you'll be confused.  Watch it again, keeping in mind that /the two transformations are simultaneous/.  Now watch it all cohere--until the ending...",971136000,4,1366,4.93859649122807

I like all of his films ( I will vehemently defend Dune and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) except for this disappointing effort. I like films that meander and are nonlinear in structure but Lost Highway is just boring and headache inducing. I recommend taking dramamine before being subjected to the sledgehammer aesthetics that Lynch throws at you on the screen. Also does the film have a point? Perhaps, but I was in so much  excruciating pain to even care about the characters or try to dechiper the plot. The other friends I watched this with were either asleep or checking their watches for when it would be over. This film is nowhere in the class of Eraserhead, Blue Velvet or Wild At Heart. At least Mr. Lynch redeemed himself with his next effort The Straight Story.",969408000,5,843,4.582781456953643

895611,4,630451087X,"To Amazon and David Lynch: I'll buy a copy of ""Lost Highway"" when it comes out on DVD, okay? The home theater setup that my partner and  I have invested in has spoiled us, and we don't even bother with VHS  anymore. Videotape pales in comparison to the superior audio and visual  quality of DVD.
The first time I saw ""Lost Highway"" was by way  of a very poorly transferred preview tape with a timecode at the bottom of  the screen. The lousy video and audio quality combined with the extremely  oblique plot and narrative structure left me scratching my head and saying,  ""HUH?"" Later, when the film made its way to one of our local  movie theaters, I decided to give it another chance. That the audio and  visual quality was vastly better goes without saying ... and I was also  able to mull over the story and at least try to piece together the puzzle.  After I viewed the film yet a third time, having rented a copy from a video  store, my opinion of it had improved greatly.
But make no mistake about  it: Viewers who like their movies spoon-fed to them and want plot and  narrative to be tidy and neat will not like this film. In ""Lost  Highway"" David Lynch has given us a world in which the notions of  cause and effect are not QUITE was we are accustomed to, a world in which  one might literally assume a new identity if pushed to emotional extremis,  a world in which one might come face to face with his own doppleganger in  the darkened hallway of one's own home.
You can watch ""Lost  Highway"" over and over, and each time you might feel like you've come  a little closer to putting all the pieces together and solving the puzzle  ... but the solution forever evades your grasp ... just barely. It's  frustrating and provocative all at once, an enigmatic Rubik's Cube of a  film. Many people don't like movies like this, but I do. The best works of  art are often the most intellectually challenging, and in David Lynch's  universe a good mystery doesn't necessarily have to have a solution.",966556800,11,2002,4.416438356164384
895612,3,630451087X,"In Lost Highway, David Lynch returns to some of the things that worked so well for him in Blue Velvet in 1986. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a very good script here, and to make up for that he tries too hard to be mysterious and arty. The first part of the film plays like an experimental low budget amateur venture (although the acting is professional). The sets are too dark and the games with the lighting lead to nothing. The long takes on the faces of the actors add nothing, and the long time spent fading to black creates nothing more than a mood of impatience. The supernatural hooey is strictly grade ""B."" The barroom lighting in most of the interiors recalls the apartment in Blue Velvet, but the apartment in Blue Velvet worked well because of its lay out and how it was set up to work effectively in the plot of the movie. Here we just have a lot of barroom lighting with little purpose.
Robert Blake, with his white clown face makeup as the ""mystery man,"" expands on the cameo character of Dean Stockwell in Blue Velvet, but he is not so interesting as we eventually see he is another tired personification of some kind of Lucifer. Patricia Arquette plays the female sex animal as Isabella Rossellini did in Blue Velvet and she is as sexy as sexy can be, but not as interesting as Rossellini because she is a little too perfect physically, and too psychologically familiar. Lynch's idea that women are evil temptresses leading men astray is worked on here, but yields nothing new.
Main problem besides the script is Lynch has no Dennis Hopper. And he has no contrast. Laura Dern in Blue Velvet was a perfect foil to Rossellini, really etching their contrasting characters for us, but against Arquette plays only a variation of herself. Bill Pullman is good in a grim, spiritless role. Balthazar Getty, with more to do, does it very well.
The movie is also very poorly edited. A lot of the first half hour could have been profitably tossed. The film only gets going after the prison scene. (The ""road rage"" scene in the Hollywood Hills was good.) The desert scene where Arquette seems to turn into Blake was a wonderful opportunity lost. Instead of sex by the headlights of the Mustang in front of a dreary wooden structure (I don't think the crew got farther than Victorville) how about sex among the cacti in the blazing sun in front of something adobe? And the Lost Highway Hotel? Gee, how did everybody end up there apropos nothing and without rhyme or reason? How convenient for the requisite gore to follow.",965952000,3,2526,4.603104212860311
895613,5,630451087X,"For many of you who saw Lost Highway, the meaning and interpretation of  the film has eluded you.  If you are anything like me, you spent hours  reviewing the movie, thumb on the pause button, notebook in lap!  The  beauty of the film truly lies in it's mystery.  It is a work of art, and as  with any artistic expression, the piece is left open for interpretation by  all.  Each persons opinion or conclusion neither being right or wrong.  My  original ideas included comparing Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield (Patricia  Arquette) to a modern day Eve, working with the devil/mystery man (Robert  Blake) as she lured the men in the movie into sin.  My other major theory  was that the main characters in the movie at one point sold their souls to  the devil, and he held total control over their fate, drawing them into his  den and forcing them to do his dirty work, i.e. porn, murder, etc.
Well,  my interpretations were all well and good, but I was interested in what was  going through the mind of David Lynch and Barry Gifford when they wrote the  movie.  I did a little research, and this is what I found...
Night  People
The idea for this movie came to David Lynch while reading a book  by Barry Gifford called Night People.  In the book, Barry uses the term  ""lost highway"" and those words sparked an idea in David's head.  From this  early point, David knew he wanted to make a movie about the unknown.  He  contacted Barry, and they set out to write the movie.
Murder
If any of  you are wondering if Fred actually killed Renee, the answer is yes.  Fred  lived in constant fear of loosing Renee, constant fear that she was  cheating on him, and most importantly, constant fear of her past.  He loved  Renee, but at the same time hated her.  Whenever he saw her, he saw her  past.  Sex with Renee was a torturous reminder of her experience in porn,  making it impossible for him to even finish.  Eventually, he just snapped.  If you watch the movie again, pause it at the point where he  watches the  final video tape, and jog slowly over the portion where we see Renee's  body.  You will see what kind of anger and rage exploded inside Fred when  he killed her.  Her torso is ripped apart, her upper and lower body are  completely separated and her hand is cut off and lying on the bed.  Continue to jog slowly and you will see Fred stare directly into the camera  with a piercing, maniacal gaze.
Psychogenic Fugue
Psychogenic fugue is  an existing mental condition in which the subject, wanting to escape  reality, creates a new reality inside their head.  The person will create  new friends, a new job, a new home, everything.  Pretty much the entire  movie takes place within Fred's head.  When the movie opens, Fred has  already killed Renee and he starts creating an alternate reality.  He  infuses his own reality with tiny portions of the truth, so some of what we  see is actually based on fact, but the majority is what Fred is creating  inside his own head.  A very important line in the movie is when Fred and  Renee are explaining to the police why they don't own a video camera.  Fred  says he doesn't like them, that he ""would rather remember things his way,  not necessarily the way they happened""
When Fred is imprisoned, his  mental illness kicks into high gear.  He is on death row, and any hope of  escaping his nightmare (his real life) is lost.  He is stuck in this cell  until his death.  His only way out is to completely escape to a new  reality.  This is when he essentially snaps and in his own mind, he takes  on a new identity, Pete.  The rest of the movie is him trying to live a  life he finds more attractive.  He is a young, good-looking guy, who has no  trouble getting any woman he wants.  Then he meets Alice (a now blonde  Patricia Arquette), his alternate version of Renee.
But, Fred is so  sick, that even in the reality that he is creating, Alice becomes a product  of his paranoia, eventually turning on him, declaring ""you will never have  me"" while they are having sex and then getting up and walking away.  This  is the point in the movie, in the desert, when Fred decides to abandon this  alternate reality and he reappears and Pete disappears.
The last scene  of the movie is Fred being chased by the police down the highway as he  begins to transform again, just like in the prison cell.  This reality  didn't quite work out the way he wanted it to, and now he is out there  somewhere, living a new life again.  Let's hope this one worked out for  him! &#61514;
Robert Blake
The mystery man is truly the most  fascinating aspect of this movie.  In my opinion, he is Fred's idea of the  devil.  He has supernatural powers and he feeds off the sins of mortals.  The scene at the party is one of the creepiest movie scenes I've seen, yet  at the same time it is hilarious.  The way the music and party noise fade  when the mystery man and Fred walk up to each other created a bizarre and  surreal exchange.  Another great scene of the movie is when Mr. Eddy and  the mystery man call Pete together.  ""Yeah Pete, I just wanted to jump back  on and let you know I'm glad your ok!""  Click.  That was great.  And of  course, I can't talk about the great scenes in the movie without mentioning  the ""tailgating"" scene.  Robert Loggia (Mr. Eddy) is a  master.
Conclusion
Keeping in mind David's use of psychogenic fugue as  the main characters mental illness, the movie is actually very simple.  Watching the movie again, keeping this all in mind, is an entirely new  experience.  The first several times I watched it I was intrigued by the  puzzle.  Now, watching the movie, I can relax, stop trying to figure out  how everything relates to everything else, and watch what is actually  happening.  I suggest, if you are a fan of the movie and haven't seen it in  a while, or if you learned some new things here, then go back and watch it  again.  You will realize more than ever that David Lynch is brilliant, a  master of the avant-garde.",964828800,435,5985,4.424074074074074
895614,5,630451087X,"I often think that David Lynch starts by creating his films by producing the soundtrack, then adding ""some visuals"" and the story evolves from it in an organic way. This certainly appears to be the case with  ""Lost Highway."" If you liked Twin Peaks: Fire walk with Me for  it's general level of weirdness then you'll love ""Lost  Highway""
The film is more coherant than Twin Peaks - less strange  stuff for the sake of it. The symbolism is much more subtle and grafted  onto the plot. It's a terrifying film, not because there is anything in  there that is gory but it's so quiet, dark and moody that you get an  uncomfortable feeling watching it (now *that's* directing).
The story?  Well, it's difficult to explain and makes Dune seem like ""The  Waltons"" in comparison. As Lynch puts it, it's about a man who  experiences a 'psychotropic fugue' to get away from his current  existance
The soundtrack is simply staggering and I don't just mean the  music. Lynch seems like the only director who actually USES sound to his  advantage to tell the story, scare or horrify the audience. The music is  terrific, I bought the album straight after seeing the video, David Bowie,  Angelo Badalamenti all in one.

The point in his art is to sit back and enjoy the intensity of his images and sounds, and as opposed to most films in our age, his style is the animal, the the other and more  accepted style is the machine.  But you see there is so much imagery impact  in his lurid mind-trip Lost Highway, that we find ourselves so unaccostumed  to this style, this dimension of film, that we make the fatal mistake of  rationalizing what has been created, and there, in the deliberation of so  many trivial elements to his film like the plot that we kill a sleek,  tantalizing, erotic rupture from normal film making and, almost surely, our  desolate reality.  Perhaps a mistake was made in calling this a 'film', but  rather a 'documented dream'.  Yeah I know it sounds hokey, but when was the  last time you could rationalize a dream that you found tangible and, well,  to your liking?  And it wasn't to your liking because it was organized and  a well plotted storyline, but because the images you witnessed were  intriguing, arousing somekind of hidden appreciation and focus in the most  abstract compilations of you cerebral cortex.  Lost Highway is delving into  that place, awakening your abilities to really enjoy the simplicity or  complexity of Lost Highway's images.

That being said, this is an excellent film. Lynch draws upon the stylings  of Fellini, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, Bergman, and Hitchcock to create a movie  that decidedly rebels against audience expectation, and this quality is its  strength.
In order to ""get"" this film, you should have some  familiarity postmodern literature (Delillo, Borges, Ashbery, etc.),  speculative/science fiction/horror literature (for example, Poe, Shepard,  and Lovecraft), along with a little knowledge of  theorists like  Baudrillard and Merleau-Ponty. Sorry to name-drop folks, but unless you're  interested in the aforementioned subjects, you probably won't be able to  understand this movie at all.
Of course, being unable to understand  something doesn't necessarily indicate that you won't enjoy it.

With Lost Highway I have been given  something to think about in order to understand.  I am constantly surprised  to discover so many people refusing to recognize greatness simply because  they do not understand it.

The film doesn't exactly play  fair in many respects, but then again we don't really want Lynch to anyway,  and it never really tells you that this is not an objective narrative.  Figuring out what Lynch is doing and what is being said is difficult and  Dave really makes you work for those nuggets, but thats the fun  here.
Again, not a film for everybody but, if you can handle very  subjective cinema, then you've got a chance.

895681,4,630451087X,"""The Lost Highway"" is by far one of the best movies I have seen. Bill Pullman is cool in this movie, and Patricia Arquette well she is self explanatory. I haven't quite understood why nobody likes this movie because  me and my friend thinks it is one of the best movies we've seen in a long  time. I find this movie very hillarious, especially the tailgating seen, me  and my friend was rolling on the floor after that. Not only is Bill Pullman  and Patricia Arquette great in this movie, but there are other actors such  as Henry Rollins, and Richard Pryor that make this movie even better. In my  opinion David Lynch did a great job in directing this video, his best work  yet!  I recommend this video for anyone who likes sick humor and a great  suspense.",944438400,,758,4.39568345323741
895682,1,630451087X,"David Lynch is a very skillful director. His use of the moving camera, special effects and use of filters is worthy of Martin Scorsese or Stanley Kubrick.  This movie uses all of these skills and really gives us a  haunting look at Lynch's vision.  The main problem with this movie,  however, is the plot.  There is none.  The film only makes some sense on a  subconscious and very ideological level.  It barely does that.  Unlike Blue  Velvet, which was at least a story of coming of age and lost innocence,  this movie has no point.  Blue Velvet at least made the comparison  between the dark world of Rossellini and the pure, sheltered and dull life  of Sandie.  Lost Highway attempts to deal with Pullman's obsession with his  cheating wife.  We never really feel that he is that bothered by it.  Even  as the mechanic, he still says nothing about her.  He does not have an  opinion on this new woman.  This whole film is a character study.  Yet the  only thing we know about Pullman is that he lives in a synthetic house with  a plastic-like wife and sweats a lot.  We never get into the emotions or  character of the main players.  If the movie is going to be this abstract,  it needs to deal with an emotion or human predicament; Lost Highway deals  with fancy camera angles and Arquette's naked body. It is a Remaking of  Blue Velvet with more sex and violence. All of the moments in the end up to  nothing.  They are just like most of Lynch's work, totally empty.",944438400,2,1472,4.433962264150943
895693,4,630451087X,"After reading many of the comments below, it's obvious that many viewers think this film is either total nonsense or that it's all in Fred's head (his own view of things, and that he has killed his wife).
I have seen  ""Lost Highway"" only twice, a few years apart, yet both times I've  arrived at an alternate interpretation...  What if this is some Faustian  tale with Pullman at the mercy of some devilish character?  Yes, I'm  getting farfetched, but it makes sense.  There is something sinister, even  supernatural, going only here.  Blake's man in black is entirely scary,  something straight out of a nightmare.  That party scene with the cellphone  where Blake is two places at once is very disturbing.  At first I wondered  if Blake was merely a figment of Fred's imagination, but ruled this out  because of the shot of Blake talking with another party-goer shortly  afterwards, and of his later interaction with characters like Loggia.  Consider Blake's monstrous appearance.  The character even looks  diabolical.  Deathly pale, with these evil black eyes.  He doesn't look  human at all, he looks dead (and I did toy with the idea of his being a  personification of Death)--and devilish.  He has this creepy dialogue about  meeting Pullman before and having ""been called""... it had this  Faustian aura to it, like Pullman had made some devil's bargain and then  forgotten about his end of the deal.  (Conversely, I can see how some  viewers would, instead, see Blake as a mental evil alter ego of Pullman's  murderous side.)
Patricia Arquette's character is like some sultry  seductress, ensuring Pullman's (and Getty's) damnation.  Notice that really  quick shot of her face at the beginning, before Pullman turns on the light,  when she is actually Blake!
When Pullman morphs into Getty in the prison,  I kept wondering if the movie was about ""lost souls"" and if both  Pullman and Getty were pawns of the mephistophelian Blake.  (I never  considered that Pullman and Getty were one and the same person.  Pullman is  too cultered, too artistic, to be the hoodlum Getty--who also is very  disturbed by Pullman's sax music)  Notice that Getty's character is,  initially, quite dazed--as though he has returned from the dead-- and he  has a wound on his forehead suspiciously like a bullet hole (this  disappears over time).  Getty's parents avoid discussing what ""has  happened"" to Getty--tears in their eyes--and I immediately figured  that Getty had died horribly and been returned to them...  The parents are  so grateful to just have him back (notice how blase they are about his  choice of friends and all-night outtings)that they don't question anything.  Getty's character is also told by Blake that they have ""met  before.""  Again, I wondered if this were a Faustian pact.  In the end,  Pullman returns, ever at the mercy of a persuing Blake (tormenting him with  videocam) and flees, futilely down an unending highway into damnation (?)  or insanity.  His face deforms as he screams, as though a mixture of all  the lost souls, or of his body switching rapidly from Pullman to Getty and  back?  Or, is it all just insanity?
Does it really matter?
The  whole atmosphere of the film (and its mind-blowing full-circle ending)is  remarkable and disturbing.  There is some great humor too in the film  involving Loggia (the road-rage scene, and Loggia's eerie phone call to  Getty, ""I'm glad you're doing fine..."")  Damn creepy.
""Lost Highway"" is a must-see.  I still don't have all the  answers and I know they'll never come.  But it's the mood and eerie visual  images (the reverse shot of the exploding cabin, like a premonition)that  make this film so brilliant (and some awesome music tracks).  This film  will haunt you for years to come.",942537600,20,3757,4.940322580645161
895694,2,630451087X,"""Lost Highway"" is one of those movie where you lovethe look and feeling, but you end up not enjoying the film because of it's structure.  David Lynch is a talented director, but here he presents a poor example of style exercising. The problem is, it makes no sense. It seems as if Lynch only filmed scene notes and not a finished, well-structured screenplay.  Some scenes seem as if they've just been thrown in, for no reason,just so we could see them. ""Lost Highway"" has some wonderfully intense moments, like when the little pale man in black does a telephone trick on Bill Pullman, making it seem as if he's in two places at once. But, who is this guy? What perpose does he have? What perpose does any of this have? In the area of style, it's a great movie. But you scratch your head too many times because nothing is in order, there's no story really. You could only recommend this movie for a few series of images, and that's it. This is about style, not cinema. Even the soundtrack surpasses the film with darkly entertaining songs like Marilyn Manson's ""I Put A Spell On You."" Other than that, this is a poor movie that needed a screenplay.",941241600,,1147,4.483253588516747

895697,5,630451087X,"I truly think that ignorance can be summed up by the review entitled ""TAKE THE NEXT LEFT AND AVOID LOST HIGHWAY"".  The reviewer claims that most people like it because they are merely pretentious art school  folk.  Not so.  The movie makes sense. But (and get this), only if you  think about it!
I personally go with the Mr. Showbiz review.  Lynch has  come as close to making a movie like a dream that one can possibly get.  There's one piece of dialogue that's very telling:  Fred Madison says that  he doesn't like video cameras because he likes to remember things the way  he remembers them, not necessarily the way they actually happened.  In a  sense, this sums up the whole film:  this is how Fred remembers  things.
Or perhaps you subscribe to a different explanation.  As one of  the stars of the film said, ""Think OJ.""  A man kills his wife,  then convinces himself he didn't do it.
To refer to the Mr. Showbiz  review once more, you're always right where Lynch wants you to be.  The  film is about nothing but itself.  That's the dividing factor.  If a person  can open his mind, and immerse himself in Lynch's nightmarish (and yet all  too realistic) realm, then that person will enjoy the film.  If a person it  too narrow-minded to do so, and needs to have the plot spoon-fed to them,  instead of drawing their own conclusions, then they will hate the film.  It's as simple as that.",934156800,,1396,4.48995983935743

The trick to this movie is  to just give it a chance!  Do not by any means, overanalyze it.  Let the  film take it's course because it will bedazzle you!  The subtlety and  moodiness of Lost Highway set the tone, and the characters are just there  looking as dumbfounded as we are.  Richard Pryor even makes a cameo  appearance only adding  to the bizarre nature of this film. I read EVERY  review to this film and I have come to the conclusion that alot of you just  didn't get it, you may even feel a bit bamboozled.
