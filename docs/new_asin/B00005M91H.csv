7944923,2,B00005M91H,"As an avid fan of this TV series, I already own the original 39 episodes, so I felt I couldn't miss with this DVD.  Wow, was I wrong.  I realize the footage isn't of the best quality as this was filmed over 50 years ago, so no problem there.  The bad part was content.  These episodes are nowhere near as funny or entertaining as the original Honeymooners episodes we have all come to know and love.  I don't care if all of a sudden 100 episodes were found in someone's vault -- I wouldn't buy them.  None of these ""lost episodes"" can stand up to the original 39.  Yeah, I love Ralph, Norton, Alice and Trixie and always will, but if I had to do this purchase over again, I wouldn't.  Utterly disappointing, so don't waste your hard-earned money.",1298937600,,746,4.316546762589928
7944924,5,B00005M91H,"Okay, whoever calls Honeymooners Tiresome Junk has obviously been way too brainwashed by today's dead bodies and sex in the city crap that is all the rave.  I agree ""I love Lucy"" is also great and I have all of theose sets too.  But, I disagree!  What's better than a sterotyped frantic Cuban (Ricky Ricardo), a crazy red-head a frumpy housewife and a grouchy old man.  And, that does get more tiresome than the honeymooners.  Going to Hollywood, Ricky's catawallin, Lucy's schemes, etc.  Very predictable and yet I love them all.  So, don't be a Benedict Arnold you dirty bum and buy the Honeymooners.",1136592000,14,602,4.730769230769231
