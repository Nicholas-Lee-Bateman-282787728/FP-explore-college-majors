5819731,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"Rudolph  Anaya,writer extraordinaire and of Hispanic origin,is responsible for this truly great and lucid work which portrays the heart of the Hispanic culture. This work brings to the fore,the heart and soul of the New Mexican Hispanic settlers who people this vast and glorious state. One feels the passionate spirituality that lies at the center of these hard-working,honest people's lives. The family loyalty,the beliefs,the confrontation of the mysteries of Life, the very pulse of these people as they face their fears,dreams and conflicts are all presented in this work. One admires their dignity,their fierceness,the constant battle with the evils of ignorance and the intense Faith of these peope in this work. Mr. Anaya and those who helped portray his story have left a remarkable legacy.",1379635200,5,799,5.392
5819732,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"We saw this film in a theater, a miracle considering it's limited distribution. This movie is well made & well acted, with a good story & great scenery. Unfortunately, hardly anyone got to see it! If it had half a chance (wider distribution & promotion) it would have done well.

It holds a place in my heart because my mom's family is from Abiquiu, NM, where the film was made. I recognized the church and Cantina (bar), where the bullet holes from my grandpa's gun still grace the ceiling in his honor- as former Abiquiu Deputy Sheriff Lee Maestas.
I wish it would get a second distribution, but I'll settle for my own copy of the DVD (and one for my mom, daughters, etc). I'd love to show this film to my mom, where the school teacher has her maiden name & the mention of the sheriff was probably my based on my grandpa.

Amazon.com, please sell the DVD of BLESS ME, ULTIMA - ASAP!
Thank you!",1372032000,6,895,4.3532934131736525
5819733,4,B00DJYJQ6I,"Based on the novel by Rudolfo Anaya, this PG-13 coming-of-age story is set in rural New Mexico late in WWII. When a New Mexican boy starts the first grade in 1944, he carries a red Big Chief tablet identical to the one I carried to the first grade in 1945! When his much-loved grandmother arrives to spend her last days with his family, he can't help but notice that an owl also has taken up residence.

He sees a culture clash that includes traditional ways, witchcraft, Catholicism, and just a bit of secular U.S. Army after his adult brothers return from the war.

We see:
  * Luke Ganalon (television roles) as Antonio, the super-observant first grader who witnesses the fatal actions of an hysterical posse, the bullying of a lonely classmate, the damage wrought by a faithless priest, the inspiration of a wonderful school teacher, and the healing powers of his beloved abuela.
  * Miriam Colon (""The Southside"") is Ultima, the healer who is immediately called on to save a young man dying as a result of witchcraft. This actress's career dates back to old Marlon Brando films; she's always been beautiful.
  * Castulo Guerra (""Undocumented"") is Tenorio, the firebrand who wants to incite a witch burning. He blames her for his daughters' debauchery.

This story does not shrink away from fatalities, nor does it whitewash the prejudice found in small rural communities. Our little hero is in jeopardy for his life a couple of times and that owl can be pretty fearsome! Guns are fired and people die, but the central family unit survives intact. Whew!

As we left the theater, we discussed the phenomenon of watching an entire movie that has no television sets, refrigerators, telephones, cell phones, or GPS units. However did they survive in those ""good old days?"" Closed captions will be appreciated on Amazon's DVD.",1362873600,33,1825,4.858064516129033
5819734,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"I'm retired, and see 150-180 films a year.  Bless Me, Ultima appeared in my local theatre with no hint it was coming via trailers or advertising.  It is close to perfection.  A good story for adult viewers, a beautiful
natural setting, and actors/acting for which you can only feel affection.  This is a gem appreciated by small
audiences.",1361836800,54,339,4.793103448275862
5819735,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"A lovely film based on Rudolfo Anaya's novel about a 7 year old Hispanic boy named Antonio growing-up and preparing for First Communion in rural New Mexico in the 1940s.  The setup of the story is simple enough but within his parents' two families played out all the dramas both eternal and contemporary that one could imagine.  His mother's family, the Luna's, was far more timeless, tranquil, religious (Catholic) and tied to the land (farmers), including Ultima a ""curendera"" who healed people using native cures going back to time immemorial.  His father's family the Mares'es (all vaqueros/cowboys) was ""like the sea,"" more sceptical, more worldly and also never really at peace.  Much plays out then as little Antonio prepares for his first communion and tries to figure out how the world around him really works.",1361577600,38,819,5.044444444444444
5819736,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"Bless me, Ultima is a 2013 adaptation of the 1972 widely acclaimed coming of age novel by Rudolfo Anaya, centering on Chicano culture in rural New Mexico in the mid 1940s. Through the eyes of a 6 year old boy, we watch the struggles between good and evil, between religion and atheism, between the farm and the city.

The acting is terrific. Luke Ganalon is the young boy and he is marvelous, especially in the quiet moments, of which there are many. More familiar are Benito Martinez (he played David Aceveda on TVs The Shield) as the father, veteran actress Miriam Colon as Ultima, and veteran actor Castulo Garcia as the head of a family feuding with Ultima. David Rees Snell (he played Det. Gardocki on The Shield) has a small role as a priest. Everyone does a great job, but especially touching is Colon as the elderly healer. And if you're familiar with Martinez from his action styled previous roles, this turn as a rural farmer trying to raise his family will show you just how versatile an actor he is.

Writer/director Carl Franklin is most famous for One False Move (1992), Devil in a Blue Dress (1995), and Out of Time (2003) and his penchant for films set in the past serves him well in this film.

The beautiful photography comes from Paula Huidobro and the haunting musical score is courtesy of Mark Kilian.

Variety said the film has survived the leap to the big screen with much of its magic intact, thanks to a respectful if somewhat wooden adaptation and praised the rich atmosphere, visuals and music. The LA Times called it a deeply satisfying feat of storytelling and said Colon Magisterially played the title character.

Some viewers may find the film a tad slow, but a film set in  the 40s about rural New Mexico really can't be fast paced. Indeed, many of the smaller and quieter moments in the film are what makes it so special.

Bottom line: a beautiful coming of age story set in rural New Mexico in the 40s.",1361491200,28,1936,4.561959654178675
5819737,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"This is one of the best of many excellent movies I have seen in my ;life.  Rudolfo Anaya captures the essence of the northern/eastern Hispanic culture in New Mexico and weaves it an engrossing tale that actually follows the book quite well.  I would suggest that people order and read the book before this comes out, though.  I guarantee it will not spoil the movie experience.  Note that there are some cultural things that are unique to the location and heritage, but Anaya magically places most of them in context.  You will learn from this and wish it would never stop.",1361491200,7,573,4.633663366336633

5819758,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"I read the book Bless Me, Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya years ago in college. Now I teach college English and was looking for a new movie to introduce in one of my classes. Thrilled when I found this adaptation. Great casting and a good script make this movie a great choice. The beginning is a little abrupt, but the movement slows down and works through the major plot events well with insight into each of the characters. Of course, movie adaptations rarely capture every detail and nuance of the book, and while there are some things left out (the Golden Carp storyline is probably the most notable absence), those omissions don't negatively impact the character development, plot pacing, and delivery of themes.

My students liked the movie, too. We had a great discussion on many levels following the viewing. Also, the day I was set to being the movie, I was out sick, so a colleague covered class for me. He liked the movie so much, he decided to show it in his class as well.",1491696000,,978,4.556818181818182
5819769,4,B00DJYJQ6I,"I read ""Bless Me, Ultima"" as a child. I grew up in northern New Mexico, and my great-grandmother was a curandera. With that being said, the story and its significance hold a special place in my heart and my roots in a much different way than most. It was also a proud moment for myself that a movie based on the traditions practiced and cherished by my family for centuries were represented in a film. For that I am grateful.

The movie setting and story were great. Some of the key points from the book were there. I also felt the portrayal of old New Mexico tradition was there. However, some key points were missed. I feel there was too much emphasis on certain things that didn't matter, or even coincide with the novel, nor with the culture behind it. I'm not trying to knock the artistry behind it. However, because this is ""mi cultura"", I expected more I guess.

Will I recommend it to others? Absolutely. I would recommend the book far more than the movie, only because I felt there was more lacking from the movie than should have been.",1491004800,4,1045,4.4375

5819938,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"I was intrigued about this movie as to whether it would be close to the stories I'd heard my mother tell when she was a child (being of Mexican descent you hear a LOT OF TALES!).  There was a lot of it that seemed familiar.  I actually got to watch with my mom and get her opinion.  She really enjoyed it, and she seemed to agree with a lot of how the story was told, including Ultima's beliefs. For what I hear, great grandmother was a bit like that.  In any case, the story is well told, and the characters are quite familiar if you come from that culture, but when it comes to family issues, it relates to all cultures.
The dubbed version is not that great (they usually aren't, but that's not the production's fault. ) It lacks the emotion you get from the original version.  Still, I do recommend it, but I think you should watch it in English, and use subtitles if you must.  I'm glad I got it.",1432684800,,900,4.173410404624278

original charm of the book, but left me feeling completely proud of my Hispanic heritage. As a former English teacher, I taught this book
to my sophomore students, and it gave me the opportunity to illustrate unique aspects of the Hispanic culture in an entertaining and magical

5819982,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"One of the most beautiful movies ever made.  I loved the book, as well.  It has been called ""controversial"" because its message is that we, as human beings, draw from ALL of our ancestral and cultural knowledge, knowledge we learn in school, and also from the traditions and religions which guide us in life. When Antonio is torn apart by conflicting information he receives from many different traditions he is exposed to in childhood, he learns that moral responsibility involves discovering what one truly believes in his/her own heart and that all traditions have some things we can learn and grow from--that it isn't always a matter of ""either/or"" but perhaps a more inclusive and accepting idea that the deeper truths are true on many levels.  I can understand that readers who insist on rigid ""right/wrong"" answers all the time feel threatened by the idea that often we must know that there is a basic ""okayness"" to questioning, learning,and struggling to make sense of paradox. Our culture tends to be uncomfortable with that kind of thinking, and yet the great contemplative saints of all traditions have long expressed this idea.

In the movie, Antonio explains in the end how Ultima was able to teach him to make strength from his experiences, and to be curious and wonder about many things in life. He tells how she taught of the eternal soul, and how it grows as a result of embracing life and the things that occur. Ultima taught Antonio, and others, about both good and evil. She had a very powerful impact on many people in the movie, and her powers were able to unearth the secret to understanding life. The owl in the movie is known as Ultimas soul. This is why when the owl was shot, Ultima also died. This owl was passed down to her, and is the reason for her mystical powers. The owl protects Antonio and comforts him. At the end of the movie, before Ultima passes, she has Antonio bury the owl so he feels as if he is really burying her. Throughout the movie, Antonio is confused about what he is supposed to become and the differences between good and evil. Antonios father wants him to become a farmer, and be able to appreciate the land God has provided. His mother wants him to become a priest, being a daughter of farmers. Ultimas mission is to help him understand what his destiny is. Antonio is curious about why some people are evil, and if God will ever forgive them. Antonio tries his best to get into touch with God, and make sure God forgives his sins. As the movie concludes, Antonio matures a lot.

As the movie comes to its end, we are told that Ultimas magic is her personality. Ultima accepts the good and bad in life, she sympathizes with and for others, and she is complete. Antonios father describes this as her magic. Therefore, Ultimas mystical power isn't her ability to do spells. Instead, it is her understanding of life. She passes this magic to Antonio through her explanation of life.
  The owl symbolizes Ultimas magic and her understanding. In a way, it represents her spirit; she dies with the owl. The owl was passed down to her from the person who taught her all about life, and gave her the wisdom she currently attained. Therefore, the owl also symbolizes wisdom.
  In all the dangerous situations and main occurrences, Antonio was present. He played a huge role. The way he handled every situation was unbelievable, especially of a child of his age. His decisions and actions displayed maturity. Many characters refer to Antonio as one with a pure heart or innocent. Also, he stays with God even when its hardest for him.

For example, she did not only know the value of spiritual value but also know the value of Catholic faith though she was a mystical tradition person. In this movie, Ultima was also a Antonio's protecter. Her owl plays important role in this movie. The owl represents Ultima's life force. For example, when Antonio is almost shut by the man, the owl tried to protect him from the man who tried to shut him. By experiencing so many happenings with Ultima, Antonio began to have questions about considering right or wrong which is based on belief. He was really easy to be influenced by other people around him because of his innocence.

5820235,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"The movie Bless me, Ultima expresses a deeply thought-provoking story that combines the elements of darkness, innocence, faith and peoples wonder of life in a way leading the readers to explore the hidden rationale of life. The story is about a wise curandera guides a six-year-old boy resolving dilemmas caused by the struggle of faith and capriciousness of destiny.
  In the movie, Ultimas mystical healing power left us indelible impression as she magically cures moribund Uncle Lucas. To Antonio, her enigmatic strength opens a new horizon to look at life. It implies the strange magic hidden in everyones heart. And that is what Ultima tried to teach him, that the evil and tragedy of life could be defeated by the magical strength that resides in the human heart.
  One of the most interesting symbols in the movie was the owl. On the one hand, I believe the owl symbolizes the malevolent and vengeful side of Ultima. When Tenorio curses Ultima of being a bruja, the owl rips out his eye while Ultima crosses through the door with a cross over it. On the other hand, the owl also represents a protective spirit of Ultima. When the owl is shot for saving Antonio, Ultima died shortly after. And Antonio knows that when hes buried the owl, he is also buried Ultima.
  With progressing plots, Antonios loss of innocence is getting more evident as he becomes more cognizant and aware of the good and evil present in the world. When Antonio is occupied with the questions of his uncertain destiny, he once believed that the first Communion would answer all his worries, but Ultima teaches him that he must reconciles the problems with his development of maturity and arrives a conclusion himself. Taking part from both sides, Antonio becomes a man with his own belief.

Viewing this movie brought back childhood moments of my life, where someone or something seemed to intervene to move the moment forward.  In Bless Me, Ultima, there is the magic of a purely innocent boy being guarded and guided by an old spirit of good and healing.

There is no mistaking the movie's message of an ounce of good warding off a mountain of evil. Where religious ritual clashes with shamanic practice and the fate of many lies in the blessing of a few.  The more life we've lived might determine how much we understand and appreciate this movie.  I bought this for a special healer in my life who's blessed me along my path.

But, as is so often the case, the film version lacks the heft and poignance of a book. The pairing of the book and film could offer an ideal experience. So much of Tony's struggle is internal, and Anaya's language so rich that the message (on paper) reads artfully and carefully layered. Without Tony's inner monologue, though, the urgency of his religious and ethical quandaries is lost. And, for me, that is the core and pathos of the book--the inherent paradox of committing to a belief system with rigid boundaries, judgements, and exclusivity. And yet without one, who are we? Where are the boundaries, how do we judge? Do we? Who is in? Who is out? Who decides? These are the questions I did not find myself wrestling with in the film; whereas, they are woven into the text.

5820412,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"A book like Bless Me Ultima is hard to shift to a new container.

This film wonderfully captured the stories that Anaya used. The stories from Santa Rosa were full of magic, and revenge, and fear, and honor, and loss. In the book, Anaya tied those stories together with a lyrical magical realism. The film did not require that literary device, and it was wisely dropped.

There is a real New Mexican quality of spareness in this movie. The kitchen tables brought tears to my eyes. I could picture my mother and her sisters sitting at those table all night long, drinking coffee and telling stories. Sometimes filmmakers are so taken with the beauty of New Mexico that they fail to take into account the empty spaces. It is the scale of sky and land that makes essential the spiritual grappling of humans. This film switched back and forth in scale, reminding us how big and how small we are. I am not the sort of movie fan who usually learns who the cinematographer is, but Paula Huidobro's cinematography was perfect.

The movie did an ok job at presenting conflicts, even though they left out two main points; the golden carp and Antonio's religious struggle. The movie correctly displayed social prejudice from the novel.  But it failed to include major symbols such as the golden carp.  In the movie, there was a lot of allusion to the bible.  The movie portrayed many Catholic ideas and practices, which contributed to Antonio's culture.  The setting was accurate and the movie did an outstanding job in choice of setting.  One difference that I found interesting is that in the struggle/death scene between Tenorio and Narsico is in the rain, whereas in the book, it is in the snow.  I also found that I was disappointed with the exclusion of the struggle over religion and the golden carp.

It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a simple slice-of-life story, a WWII coming-of-age narrative, a supernatural parable, or a cautionary tale about the dangers of religious zealotry.  Why does Ultima favor Antonio? Why isn't he suspicious of her, like his siblings are? How has he changed after she's gone/what impact did she have on him? I assume she shows up to pass her wisdom onto Antonio, but why him? And was she successful? These questions were never answered; neither were many smaller questions.

The real curanderas had knowledge of remedies using herbs and other natural skills to help and heal people. As well as sensing spirits whether good or evil.

This includes the arrival of Ultima (Miriam Colon), a sort of cultural shaman, who has come to live out her final days with his family. Weather-beaten and leather-skinned, Ultima is filled with old person wisdom and the power to both heal and cast out evil spirits. It is the latter, in particular, that ends up causing trouble with some of the people in the village, who suspect her of being a ""bruja.""

Written and directed by Carl Franklin, ""Bless Me, Ultima"" is what ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" might have been like had Harper Lee seen fit to imbue it with generous touches of Magic Realism (in that version Boo Radley probably would have been an actual ghost).  As befits the genre that also brought us ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" ""Bless Me, Ultima"" comes replete with incantations, magic spells and a Significant Owl that passively observes all the human activity, then swoops in at keys moments of the story to make its presence felt. Antonio is surrounded by adults who are steeped in religious superstition, and he is forced to bear witness to some pretty horrendous actions arising from that fact. But he also learns from Ultima that, while evil may indeed exist in the world, one can overcome it by becoming one with nature and the spirits that inhabit it.

The structure of ""Bless Me, Ultima"" tends to be episodic and choppy, a situation that leaves a number of plotlines underserved and a number of characters (Antonio's older brothers, for instance) underdeveloped.  On the other hand, the wide-eyed Luke Ganalon makes for an appealing and charming Antonio, and Benito Martinez (""The Shield,"" ""Sons of Anarchy"") scores as the dad who dreams of one day moving his family to California.

Despite all the supernatural and preternatural touches, ""Bless Me, Ultima"" feels overall pretty familiar as coming-of-age tales go, but the unusual setting and Ganalon's performance earn it a mild recommendation.",1380585600,,2221,4.943699731903485
5820545,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"This is an excellent movie. It captures the sense of innocence I experienced while reading the book. It's well written, well acted, beautifully filmed and well worth the time and money I spent on it. It's the kind of movie that will certainly pass the test of time. I wish I could've seen it in a grand movie theater.  I highly recommend it.",1380412800,3,341,4.412698412698413
5820546,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"I love the book! They did a great job transferring it into film. I grew up in Santa Rosa, NM which is in/near where most of the story takes place, so it was nice to see some of that in the film as well.",1380412800,,202,3.6136363636363638
5820547,5,B00DJYJQ6I,"I lived in New Mexico for most of the eighties and nineties, went to UNM, studied Native American and Chicano culture in my Anthropology classes. For a non-native I know northern NM pretty well. I have fished the Chama River (in the film) and hiked all over the Sangre de Christo Mountains. This small but searingly beautiful film captures the spirit of the place so well. Look a little deeper, and see that the film, through the eyes of the holy curandera Ultima, and the gifted little boy she blesses so deeply, examines the very essence of the true meaning of religion. Antonio's father says almost off-handedly to his son that it is simply perfect sympathy with living and all things in the world. This not so simple farmer speaks the purest truth. Antonio ""plays the priest"" for his friends in the schoolyard, but refuses to condemn his suffering and agnostic friend who has struggled so painfully with God. I have known and worked with good Catholic priests (the one in the film is just harsh and punitive), yet this film is about true Holiness and where it is found-in a woman of purest blessing, and the courageous sympathy (or empathy) of a small boy. Another recent cinematic treatment of NM-Breaking Bad, examines a man's long descent into disharmony and chaos, through the seamier aspects of parts of Albuquerque- also very authentic, but I am so glad that this little film examines the deeper spirituality of this area so dear to me.",1380326400,12,1446,4.742063492063492
5820548,5,B00DJYJQ6I,Bless Me Ultima is one of those movies that pulls you in and has you experience all of the emotions and experiences of it characters.  It is one of the best productions I've come across.  It is truly beautiful.,1380240000,,210,4.358974358974359
5820549,3,B00DJYJQ6I,"I suspect something essential from the book was left out.  It's always good to learn different properties of native plants and use them to help the sick.  However, when that feeds broader superstitions, widespread paranoia and suspicion can lead to disaster.  The little boy learns to appreciate what helps the community and reject what drives them apart.",1379894400,,355,5.192982456140351

It is a decent enough film but the book is so very much better that I highly recommend reading that instead, or also.  I read the book a long time ago, passed it on to my children who also read it and to this day, we all still regard it as one of the best and most impressive books we've ever read.  A few of us have read it more than once.  It is not often that a film made from a book equals, much less outshines, the book and this one does not.  It is okay but if you can, read the book.",1508889600,,597,3.6692913385826773
