8456099,3,B00542SGSC,"It would be a understatement to say that Pyar Ka Punchnama is the most misogynistic film of the year. Through this film, all the men are losers and the women cunning, vile and treat men like dogs. However these men have only themselves to blame for succumbing to pathetic heights of despair but they love their plight.

Rajat [Kartik], Chaudhary [Raayo] and Liquid [Divyendu] are three friends who have staid lives and are looking for love and attention, someone they could have romance with. So Rajat meets Neha ( Nushrat) and they move in together. Chaudhary meets Riya ( Sonali) but she still pines and craves for her boyfriend Varun( Padam). Liquid pines for his colleague Charu ( Ishita) but she likes him for favors and her heart is with Abhijeet( Ravjeet). Thus the story is about these three losers and how they get abused by the women they passionately love.
The director Luv Ranjan has done a great job with this movie. Most of the are conversations, these friends have with each other are the ones you might have had with your friends and even found some of your buddies in similar predicaments. The screenplay is witty and the situations hilarious, although I feel it could have used some editing because the proceedings get lengthy towards the end. The most amazing scene was the monologue by Kartik at the end about the perils of a relationship, had me in splits and pressing the repeat button. This scene alone is worth the time spend watching the film.
The songs are okay and funny, especially Ishq na kariyo kaake and Kutta.
This film is to be enjoyed. Four stars . 9/15/2011",1321315200,,1592,4.685714285714286
