8342320,5,0978518721,"In Program Two, of the ""Origins & Oracles"" series, Michael Tsarion explains exactly why the world is in the present state of decay, and who it is that really rules from the top of the ""power pyramid."" We discover that earth's crime-soaked history has been manipulated by powerful secret societies with bloodline connections to ancient alien visitors who crossed their own DNA with that of earth's indigenous inhabitants. According to Michael Tsarion's astonishing thesis, some of these original ""Fallen Angels"" are secretly interred beneath the ground in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in other locations around the globe. These ""undead"" vampiristic kings of old have been feeding off the death and mayhem, the pain and fear of human beings for millennia and their servants, upon the earth's surface, have orchestrated wars, assassinations, and a climate of perversity and debauchery to feed their dark masters soon to arise again from their unholy repose. This arising is forced due to the approach of powerful constellational alignments and the coming of an ""Age of Revealing"" referred to in ancient Maya texts, and in the Book of Revelations. It is of paramount importance that each and every human being discovers what these alignments will mean, what the future holds, and what the world's ancient scriptures are warning us about. This riveting investigation into the occult history of the world will open your eyes and allow you to make sense of the agendas of government and religion, the strange preoccupations of the media, and much of what will transpire in future years.

Additionally, Michael also reminds to us of the importance of cleansing the ""inner temple."" He reminds us that a toxic mind creates a toxic society. It is schizoid people who inevitably create a schizogenic society, and who are responsible for raising-up the sadistic ""Orwellian"" regimes which prey over the good and the free. Michael delineates for us the age-old connections between mind and world, between microcosm and macrocosm, so that we are again empowered with proactive and sustainable solutions. Michael insists that we must re-learn how to put our own inner houses in order before our efforts at overcoming our inhuman adversaries can be successful. Other stratagems are merely akin to ""re-arranging the furniture on the Titanic,"" and have not been working. Therefore, it is time for humanity to show zero-tolerance for all the false paths and leaders, and to have the truth about change. These are just a few of the topics covered in this monumental 13 hour presentation.",1301184000,5,2559,5.166265060240963
