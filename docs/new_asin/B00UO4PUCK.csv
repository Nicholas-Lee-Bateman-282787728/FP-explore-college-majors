7066090,3,B00UO4PUCK,When I purchased this I didn't realise that it was a short film (12 min),1452211200,,72,3.8666666666666667
7066091,4,B00UO4PUCK,Very well done for a short; well acted and portrayed.  Beautifully filmed and good music.  Would be nice to see an expanded version; to see here Harley takes it from there.,1451779200,,172,4.516129032258065
7066092,3,B00UO4PUCK,"It was a self-realizing adventure in love between two guys who probably never thought that they could fall in love with  easch other. Lars Slind has a great future ahead of him: being a 'greek' god and a very charassmatic persona! My fantasy is that he has his foot in my 'camp!', but, I'm sure he is 100% str8!. Hoping to see him in a full length film, with a story line much like 'Harley.'",1447718400,,391,4.213333333333333

7066096,1,B00UO4PUCK,"What I saw was sentimental, poorly acted as well as poorly cast. I did not see much because each time I tried only the last 15 minutes or so were streamed. Amazon's reply to my complaint was generic, useless.",1445644800,2,208,4.358974358974359
7066097,4,B00UO4PUCK,It doesn't dwell and leaves lots of unanswered questions but that is the nature of a short.  Well worth the rental.  Would like to see the short expanded into a feature to answer some of the questions raised.,1445212800,,208,4.447368421052632
7066108,3,B00UO4PUCK,short movie not bad  but could have been longer with a plot however for a first film,1479254400,,84,3.9411764705882355
7066109,5,B00UO4PUCK,"Short and too the point with solid performances, especially by Lars Slind,  this is a diverting story about the consequences of a gay bashing.",1478649600,,142,4.916666666666667

7066116,1,B00UO4PUCK,I really did not like this one at all.  It's a matter of personal taste,1463184000,,71,3.7333333333333334
7066117,3,B00UO4PUCK,It was OK. Like the idea but not the execution. Acting was marginal.,1461110400,,68,4.3076923076923075
8707760,5,B00UO4PUCK,A thoroughly enjoyed this short film. It is just nice to see new artists creating new works. And at an affordable price. Will be looking for more works like this in the future.,1516665600,,176,4.363636363636363
8707761,2,B00UO4PUCK,Too damn short--just a few minutes long. Could have been a good movie if standard length.,1503014400,,89,4.625
8707762,4,B00UO4PUCK,"I enjoyed this short film. We don't always know or appreciate what we've got until it's gone. Acting was a little stilted at times but the message came through loud and clear. The characters we all likeable. Give it a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1489536000,,261,4.574468085106383

8707767,4,B00UO4PUCK,enjoyed!,1483574400,,8,8.0
8707768,3,B00UO4PUCK,"A stiff and unconvincing story line about two men, one of whom is a body builder but also openly gay, the other a man of very slight build who has been the victim of a severe beating (perhaps because he is also perceived as gay). While the second man is recovering from his injuries, the first, played by Lars Slind, worries about whether his friend will even survive. When he does, there is a denouement about Slind's character's feelings for his friend. The short film is not entirely unpredictable and there is a sense that the script writer simply had an anti-bullying message to convey. A third character in the film, played by Hannah Elder, seems to be in the script simply to perform a kind of Greek chorus role, as her relationship to either of the men is unclear outside of platonic friendship.",1483401600,,803,4.583333333333333
