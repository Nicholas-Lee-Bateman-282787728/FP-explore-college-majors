8406753,5,B003VE9WQU,These DVDs are a great addition to any family's collection. We've started giving them as gifts and they are a hit.,1393459200,,114,4.476190476190476
8406754,2,B003VE9WQU,This video was too short and it lacked Israeli content. The clips seem dated and pieced poorly. Never the less I'm still buying the whole series.,1357689600,,145,4.615384615384615
8406755,4,B003VE9WQU,"I used to LOVE the classic Shalom Sesame, so I was excited to buy this for my friend's 2-year-old. The kid stared raptly at the TV, so from her perspective it was probably very good, but I was underwhelmed.

- Several filler sketches (repeats from other episodes) with no connection to Israel, Hebrew, Judaism, or any of the Rechov Sumsum cast

- The entire DVD has only one 20-min episode (my friend said: ""I hope you didn't spend too much on this."" I didn't, but still.)

-  It was a fairly soft intro to 'Shalom', falafel, counting, and not much else.

- Fairly long intro ad

I'll probably still try to get the others at some point, but maybe I'll rent or borrow them instead of buying each episode separately.",1341532800,2,714,4.453846153846154
8406756,5,B003VE9WQU,"We are not Jewish, but my husband is being sent to Israel for training for his job for a month.  So I purchased this & the adventures of Israel, for our 3 year old daughter. So she could see & understand where her father was & so they could have something to talk about when he calls home.  She loves these videos so much & learning about a different culture I purchasing the 5 DVD set.  Not to mention, that I learned some facts & helped me deal with the fact he was going to Israel.  Thanks Sesame Street for helping us see a different culture & country without leaving the comfort of our home.  The only con was my daughter, Loves Elmo & he only appeared in 1 of these DVD for a minute.  Shalom Sesame, a little more of Elmo, please.",1339027200,,736,4.111888111888112
8406757,5,B003VE9WQU,"We love these DVDs! We had gone to a promotional event at our local Jewish Community Center and saw one episode and loved it. We are now trying to collect them all. They are perfect for Jews of any denomination. I love that my children are learning about Israel, holidays and Hebrew from the makers of Sesame Street and with the great characters from it! I would recommend for any Jewish family!",1318118400,,395,4.5
8406758,3,B003VE9WQU,"I was disappointed in this DVD and have no desire to see it multiple times. But who cares? My 3-year-old loves it and is now counting in Hebrew! I loved the original Shalom Sesame, but the new one is much more appropriate for the preschool age group. Pros: No Elmo, and Grover is the primary muppet. Things are simple enough for young children to enjoy. The residents of Rechov Sumsum are a joy and not condescending. I enjoyed seeing the Arab muppet and gorgeous Ethiopian-Israeli resident Lemlem. Cons: Annelise van der Pol is loudly saccharin. Hebrew words are presented with extreme American accents. No Kippy the porcupine (actually this might be a pro for some!). Each 20-something minute episode gets its own DVD (wasteful/expensive!), and you have to watch the commercials every time. In this first 20-something-minute episode, there are a full 3 sketches that have nothing to do with Israel or Judaism. Nice sketches, but why?  I am looking forward to (my child) enjoying future episodes.",1293062400,5,997,4.970059880239521
