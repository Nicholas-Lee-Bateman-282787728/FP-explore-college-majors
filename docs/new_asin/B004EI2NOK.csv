4337281,4,B004EI2NOK,"Not as good as the first but still a fun movie.  If you like bloody over the top slasher flicks then you will enjoy this, if you have not seen the first one SEE IT!!  I will be adding this to my collection in Feb.",1295481600,13,213,3.7111111111111112
4337282,1,B004EI2NOK,"First I want to say that I really enjoyed the first film and was looking forward to the second film. Bottom line was that the story was rushed and didn't make any sense. We were given more of the background of the character however the twist at the end didn't make sense and I saw it coming. I knew that this movie was going to bad from the first kill, which didn't look real, it looked fake and plastic.

The fun and spirit of the first film is gone. I was extremely disappointed and I really wanted to like this film. I would recommend watching it if you can see it for free otherwise don't waste your time or money.",1294444800,8,618,4.15
4337283,2,B004EI2NOK,"I loved the 1st movie....but this sequel really disappointed me.  Yes it was UNRATED...which sadly just made the kills so over the top they were silly and not very effective...the belt sander kill was just ridiculous.....not to mention the stupid sex scene.
SADLY DISAPPOINTED.....Certainly not worth the Bluray price....better to wait for a USED DVD copy for about $3.",1293753600,8,369,5.254237288135593
4337284,4,B004EI2NOK,"I didn't expect much from the first ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatchet/dp/B002MWWOQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatchet</a>"" and to my surprise it became one of my all time favorite slasher flicks, the character was great, story was cool and the film was full of gore, and gore for some reason I like! Well the unstoppable force of Victor Crowley is back in ""Hatchet 2"" starting exactly where the first film left off. I can say I haven't been this excited for a movie in a while and, I was not disappointed one bit!
If you have seen the first film than you already know what your in for, if you haven't seen the first film, what the heck is wrong with you? Expect alot of gore, some nudity, alot of guns and idiots weilding them, one of the biggest damn chainsaws Ive ever seen, revenge ohhhhh sweet revenge and a whole lotta fun and entertainment!
The only things I didn't like were the characters and some of the acting, I definitely liked the cast of the first film more but that still wasn't enough for me to not love this movie as a whole. If your tired of all these lame slasher remakes (except the ""Halloweens"" which were great, haters) than get a copy of this, sit back and enjoy the gore filled ride that is ""Hatchet 2"", enjoy and long live Victor Crowley, or not.....see you in the swamp!",1292803200,22,1342,4.739316239316239
4337285,5,B004EI2NOK,"My girlfriend and I drove for 5 hours to see this in Northern VA, at the only AMC theater we could find. We weren't dissappointed, it was a fun time. Great special effects, the gore is as over the top if not more than the first one (which is a classic). The acting isn't so hot over all, but a few mentions of other great films were a treat as well as the 80's slasher humor well intact. I've waited for the announcemnt for this blu ray for quite some time, If I was any more excited about this release date I would be two people. BUY IT!",1291939200,23,538,3.990740740740741

Tony Todd has a plan and I wonder why these specific people must go to try to end him???? The same stuff, bad acting and the plotline is not real linear. But again if you liked the first and you like gore and blood galore go for this one too. One little clever bit though was in the first one you had the tour guy in this one you have his twin brother (not really but) trying to find what happened to him (he is actually in all three).",1462752000,,704,4.222222222222222

4337350,4,B004EI2NOK,"I found this to be a good sequel to the original. The people behind this did great at recreating the feel/tone/humor/excitment the first one had. The characters were mostly well acted and the kills were still gruesome. Also I like how the mythology of the first film was expanded.

Now for flaws. While I love Danielle Harris, I can't help but realize she plays her character differently then the actor from the first film. Danielle's Marybeth felt a little more emotion driven, while the previous Marybeth was more emotionally grounded. Mainly I just wish the actor hadn't changed, but would've been fine with either actor. There were a few twists that felt somewhat forced or randomly thrown into the film. Most were fine but the last one, felt stupid.

SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT
I was dissapointed at how, the characters were hyped up to be the A Team, but ultimatly turned into just another group of people, not very differnt from the first film. Also it seems Zombie, just brought them into the swamp for a reason but as it turns out, doesn't care if they live or die. Had there been one extra line of dialogue stating Zombie had some kind of beef with everyone present, I would've been fine with the ultimate portrayal of the characters.

Ultimatly, I like it but there were more problems with this one. 3/5 critique 4/5 personal scale.",1393891200,,1342,4.677966101694915

4337357,2,B004EI2NOK,"I wanted to like this movie. I am a big fan of slasher movies. I also like the actors in this movie Kane Hodder, Danielle Harris and Tony Todd but the movie was awful. I expected it to be a lot better. The first one is a real classic compared to this. The three lead horror actors did great in their parts but they couldn't make up for the bad writing and the bad acting from the rest of the cast. What bothered me so much is the change of the origin of Victor. I know Green had to add more story for it to be different but he must of been smoking some whacky tabacky when he came up with this. Victor's father had an affair with a nurse while his wife was dying from terminal illness so the dying wife turns out to be a witch and curses the nurse's baby that turns out to Victor. That's how Victor was born. It was stupid and unnecessary.
  The gore in this movie is good. I found the movie to be boring. Harris and Todd kept me watching. I thought along with Hodder they were the only good parts about the movie. The other actors were unlikable. You need to care about the characters for their to be any impact if they die or their life is at risk. Todd was a bad guy and we only like him because a great horror actor. Hodder of course plays the monster Victor so really the only likable character in this is Harris. With Harris some viewers may have trouble with her replacing the old Marybeth who was great. I think Harris did great though. I liked the ending. I am a big Harris fan so I bought this one but it's for true horror movie fans. There have been worse slashers. This isn't the worst but there is a little distance from being an average slasher movie. I think if you are a new horror fan I'd just rent or rewatch the first one. Hardcore fans will see the good aspects of it. Having three horror legends in Harris, Hodder and Todd certainly makes it worth it for true fans. Enjoy!",1389571200,,1893,4.113513513513514

4337364,3,B004EI2NOK,"After the first film, ""Hatchet"", I proposed the idea that Victor Crowley was, in fact, a family of disfigured monsters living in the Louisiana swamps who keep replacing their deceasedified kin.  I liked this idea because I REALLY don't like indestructible monsters and nobody has used the idea yet.  There should be some hope of success for our protagonists.  Well, Adam Green wasn't as clever as me.  Despite this minor disappointment, I thoroughly enjoy the first film.  Anytime you have a gas powered belt sander (REALLY!!) in a horror film, you know the mayhem is going to be marvelous.  Well, (SPOILER!!!!) it's back!!!  If you read that, don't worry; you don't know how it's used.  Though not so different from the first, there are a few things you should know about ""Hatchet II"" (clever title, no?).  Let's peel back the layers.

ADAM GREEN IS A LIAR
You see, Adam insisted that the first film was intended as a serious horror film that happened to have a few comical moments.  I call him a liar because it's not as bad as calling him a failure.  The gratuitous gore and nudity were so over the top, and the dialogue so witty, it could only be called a horror comedy.  I sure hope he drops the claim of ""serious horror"" for ""Hatchet II"" because it can get downright silly at times, and I don't really like calling people names.

ADAM GREEN DIDN'T FAIL
His ultimate goal was to make homage to the golden age of horror with ample use of practical visual effects and plug and play characters.  In this, Adam succeeded.  The list of actors is mostly a who's who of unrecognizable horror icons.  Tony Todd (Candy Man), Kane Hodder (Jason), Tom Holland (Writer of ""Fright Night"" and ""Childs Play""), r. a. Milhailoff (Leatherface), Perry Shen (nothing of note) and Danielle Harris (those unnecessary Halloween remakes).  Not exactly a distinguished cast, but what the hey.  The first ""Hatchet"" had a better cast and script, but when talking about ""Hatchet"" it's all about the gore.

MY GOROMETER IS BROKEN
The gore in ""Hatchet II"" has moved up the ratchet.  In fact it's just plain off the chart.  If you're into creative kills and over-the-top gore, this will do it for you.  If you like gore and violence to be realistic and believable, you'd better move along; this ain't it!  For the rest of us, this is just goofy fun.  When film makers get this creative about killing people, you start to wonder about their mental state.  After a while you stop wondering; they're obviously demented.  I usually mix some comment about sex and nudity with the gore; what I call ""Gordity"".  These are the staples of the horror movies this film pays homage to.  Well we get a real treat in ""Hatchet II"" with what may be the most messed up case of necrophilia put to film.  That's all the detail you'll get from me.

ADAM IS BACK ON THE HOOK
Just so you don't think I'm blind, there are a few things about ""Hatchet II"" I wasn't all that thrilled with.  I mentioned the less-than script earlier.  This script is basically a scaffold to set up a lot of creative kills.  That's not all bad, but definitely knocked down the entertainment value of everything that wasn't a kill.  The first film had pretty decent character development which made the kills all the more visceral.  The characters in this film were mostly cords of wood for chopping.  To make matters worse, one piece of wood gets killed out of view.  I hardly see the point of that since the character was so thin to begin with.  It was just a lost opportunity to have one more killification.  Lastly, the decision to give us a good look at Victor Crowley (said mutated killer) ought to come with a prerequisite, good makeup job; just saying.

SHOULD YOU ENTER THE SWAMP?
Let's make this simple:

 If ample amounts of over-the-top gore produced while a mutated maniac creatively kills large amounts of yahoos in the swamp gets you excited, then this is the film for you.
If you actually like clever dialogue, realistic violence, characters you care about, and good makeup, then steer very clear of ""Hatchet II"" or any other ""Hatchet"" film for that matter (Just to be safe).

I personally thought the production values were acceptable enough to enjoy the cavalcade of kills.  The lack of good characters and a decent script were a bit disappointing, but the fast paced gore made it palatable.

Adam Green's ""Hatchet"" series goes a long way in re-discovering that horror films can be fun..and still be scary. ""Hatchet II"" takes off right where the first one left-off. Victor Crowley is raising hell in ""his"" swamp, and the lone survivor, Marybeth (this time played by Danielle Harris) escapes Victor's clutches...only to insist on returning to retrieve the bodies of her fallen family members, and try to kill Victor Crowley once and for all.

Like the best ""Friday the 13th"" sequels, the reason the characters return to the killer's lair is secondary. ""Hatchet II"" jumps right to a fun montage of kills and we get more of Victor's back-story. One really nice element to this film is that we get to see Kane Hodder's acting chops. Playing Victor's doomed daddy, Kane puts in a top-notch performance, and it's nice to see him carry a role where he's not hidden behind a mask or under layers of latex.

You'll find yourself chuckling, and jumping in equal measure with ""Hatchet II"", which is the real draw of these films for me. Yes, there is tons of blood and imaginitive kills (a belt sander, and the biggest chainsaw ever seen outside of Texas), and of course you get a sprinkling of gratuitous nudity and sex, but for me what really stood out with the first film were the characters and humor. While I don't think the characters were as well developed in this sequel, they weren't just your usual slaughter-fodder found in most slasher flicks.

If you are looking for something a little over the top, something with plenty of chuckles as well as a few cringe worthy moments, then I highly recommend you give ""Hatchet II"" a viewing.",1377043200,,2477,6.008498583569405

If you're not a gore fan, I can't think of much of a reason to recommend it.  The film is simple to follow and you don't care about the characters; they are simply there to get slaughtered and there's hardly any character development.

HOWEVER, the sequel... my God. The acting is so bad, there is a negative improvement from the last one. Basically the characters show emotions that are so damn obviously staged. You do not get pulled into the depravity and sadness of Victor's legend.

Then the backstory doesn't explain fully how Victor's curse began. I can't give anything away, but how a woman rises from the dead to give some voodoo curse because of some cheating makes 0 sense. Did she make a pact with the devil or was she the daughter of a witch. No idea, but not interesting at all.

The kills are lamer that a limbless baby. He just hacks at people once or shoves his fingers through them, then voila, a ton of fake blood gushes onto a tree or wall. This happens for everyone that dies pretty much. At least the director got his wish of putting the belt sander to the face in.

The comedy is poor too. Just a supposed funny black guy being bold and a naughty slut. They're both not funny... just the beginning when the video camera of the recently deceased porn director is found is LOL.

So anyways... story, acting, kills, and comedy are all horribly executed. It's a garbage movie with a weak ending to top it all off. Just stay away from this.

4337384,2,B004EI2NOK,"As a fan of 80's slasher flicks, I almost liked this so-called homage, but not enough; it lacked cohesiveness.  Parts of it came across like a catalog of FX or a compilation of their greatest hits/kills.  They even slipped in a `kill' montage that rapidly demonstrated their prowess with special effects while dispatching a slew of characters they didn't have to deal with in this movie.  As bragged in their bonus feature Behind the Screams, they wanted to top the number of kills from the first feature.  That alone, is not a good reason to make a sequel; it's not the Guinness World Records.  It takes more than that to make a high quality movie.  Instead, the filmmakers wasted this opportunity backtracking too much, squandering chunks of time by rehashing things already known, and creating gaping segments where all their characters did was yap incessantly.  At times, it was maddening to watch.  Instead of moving the story forward, they stalled with lengthy exposition and speculation on whether or not a ghost can be killed.  If Victor Crowley is indeed a ghost, he appears amazingly substantial for a mere spirit.  It also didn't help that the characters employed an odd mix of acting styles throughout.  Danielle Harris pitched her performance in the range of hysteria and never lowered it but a notch or two for the entire movie.  Meanwhile, everyone else was either nosily posturing, joking, or calmly debating the finer points of names, gator hunting, and cookies.  This left Danielle in an odd world of her own where frantic behavior was the norm and levity in the face of danger the realm of the crazy.  If they had spent less time yapping about inconsequential matters and more time dealing with the monster in the swamp, they might have made a much better film.

4337386,4,B004EI2NOK,"HATCHET 2

After the first film was released it started to gather that all important cult fan following. That was more than enough for Adam Green [Hatchet, Frozen] to get his sequel financed. Of course he already had plans on doing that any way so it worked out. Now this time around he is looking to add to something that was already loved by many. In a lot of cases like that films can fail miserably if not done right. Luckily he knows what his audience wants and who they are so it turned out pretty good.

The second film picks up where the first left off with Marybeth looking for another ride back into the swamp. She still wants revenge for her family and now for her fallen friends form the first film. She goes to Reverend Zombie [Tony Todd] who appeared in the first film briefly for help. She knows he once had a haunted swamp tour and wants him to take her out there once again. He agrees but puts together a crew of hunters to find Victor and take him out. He of course has reasons all his own.

Now this is a fun film just like the first one with campy 80's over the top cool kills and such. The acting is about the same as last time and it is cool to have Tony Todd in a bigger role this time. Perry Shen returns form the last film, but didn't he get killed? Yes he did but he is playing the twin brother this time. This explains why the brother in the first film had no idea where to go, you'll see. Any way I was happy to see that because he had one of the best scenes ever on that last film.

The kills like I said are cool like they should be and the body count is higher this time I believe. Like the last film the special features here are excellent. The behind the scenes are great and the commentary is great. I fact Adam Green delivers on all his commentaries, not all directors are good talkers for some reason. So I was happy with all the special features once again.

This film while good feels a like a bit of a step down though for some reason. All the elements of the first film are there but it just doesn't seem like it is on the same level. I think that while the humor is there it just isn't as humorous. That was my favorite thing about this first movie. Don't get me wrong this is still a very good flick and very fun, you know, turn the brain off flick.",1319241600,2,2291,4.070953436807096

Hatchet 2 (2010) picks up right where Hatchet ended, with Marybeth hitting the water, however the transition isn't exactly smooth, as Danielle Harris replaces Feldman, who does not reprise her role as Marybeth.  The version of the film on DVD is ""uncut and unrated"", supposedly identical to that which played in theaters.

As in the first film, the best thing about Hatchet 2 are the kills, which are prodigious, extremely gory, and intended to go beyond what has been done before.  The carnage is so excessive and over the top, that you become numb to the violence, as the film loses any ties to reality, becoming more of a bizarre spectacle, rather than a really horror thriller.

Marybeth escapes from the swamp and seeks help from Reverend Zombie (Tony Todd), the owner of the tour boat destroyed in first film.  Zombie gathers together a group of assorted losers, puts a bounty of five grand on Crowley's head, and heads into the swamp on a boat with Justin (Parry Shen), the brother of the tour operator butchered in Hatchet.  Marybeth has recruited her Uncle Bob (Tom Holland), to join the manhunt.

Much time was spent in Hatchet building up the mythology of Victor Crowley, a deformed freak who was accidentally killed by his father, when he plunged a hatchet into his head, while trying to rescue him from a cabin that was on fire.  In Hatchet 2, even more is revealed, as Reverend Zombie (Tony Todd) recounts the story of Crowley's birth, and identifies the three boys who started the fire that led to Victor's death.  This background information is mostly filler material, as all you really need to know about Crowley is that if he sees you, he will try to kill you in a most unpleasant fashion.

Most in the hunting party are along just to be slaughtered.  This is accomplished in mostly spectacular fashion, as Crowley employs a variety of implements and tools, to crush, spilt open, rip, and sever various limbs and body parts, and cause blood to spurt out.  Crowley is a creative and inspired soul, who strives to avoid repeating himself.

Despite all the buildup regarding the legend of Victor Crowley, telling a credible story really isn't a major concern, as we're supposed to believe that $5000 is enough motivation for a boatload of morons to go on an expedition for Crowley's head.  But when the hunting party gets to the swamp, most don't try very hard to find their prey.  It is a pleasure to see to Crowley rip and tear his way through these idiots, just as was intended.  Marybeth, Uncle Bob, Zombie, and what remains of the group, take refuge in Crowley's shack.  When the manic appears, only Trent (R.A. Mihailoff) is able to challenge Crowley in a fight.

Tiny Marybeth puts up only token resistance, as she is dragged like a doll by Zombie, leaving Uncle Bob to his fate.  Reverend Zombie is a totally despicable piece of trash, and it's wonderful seeing Crowley hack him in two, and then jerk his spine, before pulling his skin off.  This scene a pure delight, but there is scant time to enjoy it.  The maniacal finish with Marybeth cutting loose on a rubbery faced Crowley, is a bit anticlimactic.  A little breathing space between these violent acts might have worked better.  Although the ending appears to be conclusive, we may not have seen the last of Victor Crowley.

The special effects are nearly all practical, and while not always realistic looking or that well executed, they are usually very entertaining, even if the timing of the kills is completely predictable.  Aside from Daniele Harris whose performance is passable, the acting is generally quite bad, largely due to a screenplay that doesn't have much regard for realism or character development.  The terribly amateurish dialog does the actors few favors.

Hatchet 2 continues in the same spirit as Hatchet, but raises the bar, with more brutal and spectacular kills.  Needless to say, if you liked Hatchet, you will probably appreciate the excesses of the sequel.  Unfortunately there is no commentary track by director Green, but there is a pretty comprehensive featurette that hits some of the high points regarding the production.

Adam Green clearly has the blood and guts part down pat, if he only could improve on his storytelling skills, he could be near the top of the heap in the horror genre.  Green's films are notable, perhaps even notorious, but have performed rather poorly at the box office and garner mediocre ratings among movie viewers.  Even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen/dp/B0034G4OVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen</a>&nbsp;(2010), a more mainstream effort, did not fare that well.  Perhaps dazzling special effects can't overcome the lack of a well told story.  Green has expressed concerns that he may be on thin ice with the movie ratings board.

It has extremely poor acting by all the actors and actresses (especially the main girl playing the teenager who never once sounded believable in either her determination to take out the swamp monster nor did she ever show much in the way of emotional accuracy whenever her life was in danger during the spots where she surely SHOULD have) and to be totally honest, expect NOTHING in the way of horror for the first 50 minutes.  Yes that's right- the first 50 minutes equates to about 70% of the movie.  Yikes.

Despite these unavoidably distracting flaws, what Hatchet II *does* do extremely well is show some of the most gruesome and creative deaths that the horror genre has to offer.  I'll spoil only one death- a guy gets his face ripped apart in a boat motor.  They really went the extra mile to show every nook and cranny of blood-splattering goodness too.

So what exactly happens during the first 50 minutes?  Not a whole lot.  You have a man in the back woods with a VERY intimidatingly creepy voice gathering a collection of hunters to his house and encourages them to search for the swamp monster.  This segment seriously lasts at LEAST 20 minutes.  Then you have the slow and ominous boat ride through the murky swamps and through the woods in search of the monster- this is another 20 minutes.  Then -actually right in the very beginning- a fair explanation concerning the storyline and why the swamp monster is out for revenge.  That's about 10 minutes.

Overall, a good movie with some good gore thrown in. Like I said, there is probably a 100% chance for anther Hatchet film. Maybe it'll be the best out of the series since they seem to be getting better.",1305936000,,890,4.085714285714285

4337398,4,B004EI2NOK,"I must say I really enjoyed Hatchet 2.  Though originality is zip, I still found it somewhat refreshing.  Essentially it's a rehash of the first film with the body count and the gore upped a notch.  The survivor of the first film's massacre, Marybeth(here played by Danielle Harris) decides to go back to the swamp and take care of killer Victor Crowley once and for all.  She gets Reverend Zombie(Tony Todd) to accompany her, and he rounds up a bunch of locals to go on the hunt.  Of course Reverend Zombie has his own selfish reasons for going along on this shindig.  And of course another massacre ensues.
I'm not gonna say that you'll like this film if you liked the first one, coz it seems as though many folks who liked the first one hated this one.
I though it was a lot of fun.  In recent years there has been a tidal wave of horror films that claim to be in the style of 70/80 horror grindhouse cinema.  I found most of these films to be failures through their use of CGI gore and sometimes MTV style editing.  I'm not saying that the Hatchet films totally get it right in that department, but it's obvious that Adam Green is a huge fan of 80s slasher films, and has really put forth the effort to make a modern day 80s slasher film.....if that makes sense.  It's not a spoof, nor is it a self referential ""I know I'm in a slasher movie and I know the rules"" kind of deal either.  It plays the horror thing straight, but is also tongue in cheek at the same time.  It's not laugh out loud funny, and many folks have complained about this.  Personally I'm glad it's not funny.  Yes, it has a few chuckles along the way-a film like this has to-but in the end we're dealing with gory, fun slasher movie schlock.
Folks have made comments about the ""fake looking"" effects.  Well, I gotta say that the effects in this film were one of the high points for me.  They add to the fun.  Good ol' prosthetic gore effects.  To those raised on and spoiled by CG gore, this won't be welcome.  But really, CG gore looks very phony, and lets face it, it's cheating.  If you've ever been unfortunate enough(unless you get off on it) to see images of corpses and mutilated bodies, they do have a ""fake"" look about them.  They sure as hell don't look like CGI.  I'd guess the gore in this film is probably more realistic that we know.  But who cares anyway?  It's cool!!
So yes, I definitely give kudos to Adam Green for giving us another Victor Crowley bloodbath....80s style!  I hope there's a third.",1303689600,11,2490,4.337662337662338

4337400,3,B004EI2NOK,"I had a different review up about this (about my first viewing), but it kept getting bad votes because it wasn't a review about the movie, instead I talked about the quality of the film streamed here at Amazon.com (you know, about the product cause that's what reviews are supposed to be about). So, here I am to re-review the product (streaming quality) and the actual film.

The streaming quality (back when I first rented this) was terrible. The colors were all off, and it was super pixely. I could barely make anything out. So it was a poor rental experience. No, it was not my TV. I can't say if they've fixed any of this, because I rented it when it first came to PPV and streaming.

As for the movie (at first viewing) I hated it. I think it was partly due to the quality of the film (which I really like), it was very distracting.

However, I rewatched it the other night in HD and it wasn't nearly as bad as I recalled. It still has a lot of issues compared to the first film, but it was still entertaining.

The main issue I originally had was Danielle Harris' accent. It was terrible. The 2nd go round I knew what to expect and really it was only bad when she got to emotional scenes. Because it made her seem like a terrible actress, which she isn't.

The kills were extremely over the top impossible. Never could happen the way they happen in this movie. Some of you out there might like that, but lately I like mine awesome/cool looking, but realistic. So while its awesome they went back to old school latex and makeup and none of that cgi BS, I thought they were just way too over the top.

The first film was a perfect mix of comedy/horror. This movie is more on the serious side, but still has slight comedy in it. Know that going into these films or you will possibly be disappointed.

I've got a lot more to say about this movie, but that's reserved for my horror movie/book review blog: Shivers of Horror. Link in my profile.",1301356800,,1947,4.317808219178082

The scenery and deaths were so but this one misses on every level. It has F-level acting while the first one was passable and the gore is ridiculously unrealistic and fake while the first one had great death scenes. Unbelievably bad for a movie much cheaper looking. The new girl was a bad actor all the fake crying got annoying. I personally feel like this may of worked better if it followed a completely different group of unfortunate souls who wandered onto Mister Crowleys' land by accident instead of picking up with Marybeth's narrow escape. It just makes so much sense that after getting away from a deformed monster who is capable of ripping people apart with his bare hands, the first thing I would want to do is go right back into the thick of it just to bring my mangled family's body back home.

Later Jack discovers Marybeth is a Dunstan and orders her out and to go talk to Rev. Zombie. Victor shows up at Jack's shack, rips out his intestine then uses it as a cord to pop off his head. The killing and gore in this movie can best be described as ""Troma"" style. Every death scene hits a major squirting artery. This beginning scene also has the bulk of the movie's nudity as Jack views a found video camera.

Marybeth, who is perhaps the worst at acting in this film, visits Rev. Zombie (Tony Todd) who explains how Victor Crowley became a ghost/legend/killer with a remarkable story telling voice aka the James Earl Jones of horror movies. As it turns out, Zombie's boat was lost in Honey Island Swamp. He forms a posse (including one hot blond for one last nude/sex scene) to retrieve his boat and to kill Victor Crowley once and for all.

People die in all kinds of ways as Crowley seems to have an endless supply of gasoline powered tools. Notice when faces are being smashed, they have a tendency to bounce back as if they are made of rubber. In the old house, where everything is grown over, there is a new door. Cletis was my favorite redneck character. He was realistic.

Critics that pan the acting, script, violence, etc., really need to take a step back and realize that this was the intention of filmmaker Adam Green, to make an old school slasher film with buckets (and buckets and buckets) of blood and gore, humorous, if cheesy dialogue, and of course, the mandatory female nudity.

The sequel, as you've probably heard already, picks up immediately where the first one left off, with Marybeth (this time played by scream queen Danielle Harris) escaping the clutches of Victor Crowley (again played by Kane Hodder, reprising his duel role as Victor and also his father). Marybeth, along with Reverend Zombie (Tony Todd, of the Candyman and Final Destination film series), assemble a team of characters to venture into the swamp to ""make sure it's safe""; in actuality, they're really going to find Marybeth's father and brother's bodies, and hopefully kill what's left of Victor Crowley.

I had alot of fun watching this movie, even though it seemed to take a while to set up for the characters to finally enter the swamp, it was entertaining just to wait and see just how Victor was going to kill people this time. I noticed this movie has a much more serious, darker tone than the first one, but it still has plenty of funny and outright crazy moments. The Blu-ray picture seemed to be pretty dark, and on another TV I watched it on, the picture seemed very grainy; I don't know if this was the intention of Adam Green, but it didn't distract from the fun of it all.

The kills were pretty ridiculous this time around, although not as insane as I thought they were going to be. One of the scenes in particular, involving Victor's trusty hatchet, is outright brutal, which is just how I like it.

So if you're a fan of old school horror/slasher movies, and especially a fan of the original film, I definitely recommend checking this out.",1296604800,3,1966,4.7063953488372094

What kills Hatchet II (no pun intended) is that it just doesn't pack the same kind of bloody punch that the first film did.  Sure it's bloody enough, and the gore effects are inventive as well, but everything else; from the acting, to the set pieces, to the script, is just way below what the first film managed to accomplish.  Still, there's plenty of odes to the first film, and even a nod to Adam Green's Frozen and direct-to-DVD favorite Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, which is actually kind of cool.

Part II SIDEBAR: So after Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder; Friday the 13th parts VII-X, Hatchet) survived being burned alive and speared through the neck with an iron gate pole, he pulled a Jason Voorhees and aquatic-ambushed our final survivors Ben (Joel David Moore; Shark Night 3D, The Diary of Anne Frankenstein in Chillerama) and Marybeth (Tamara Feldman; Perfect Stranger)with the credits rolling as Crowley slovenly rages with Marybeth in his clutches. Replacing Tamara Feldman, Danielle Harris (Halloween I-II, The Black Waters of Echos Pond) assumes the role of our surviving heroine whose initial goal was to rid the swamp of Crowleys curse since, in fact, it was her gator-hunting father (Robert Englund; Zombie Strippers, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Freddy vs Jason) and brother who were killed in part 1s opening scene.

Writer/director Adam Green (Frozen, The Diary of Anne Frankenstein in Chillerama) delighted audiences with his spoofy horror (Hatchet) paying homage to the Gods of 80s slasher movies, and now he has returned to develop his killers folklore. This sequel picks up immediately as Hatchet (2006) left off: with Marybeth in Crowleys clutches in the swamp. And just as quickly as she finds safety, we learn that her family ties run deeper than both part 1 revealed and deeper than even Marybeth realizes.

Horror icons Tom Holland (Fright Night, Childs Play), R.A. Mihailoff (Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Pumpkinhead II, Smothered) and Tony Todd (Final Destination 5, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) round out the cast, which curiously includes Parry Shen (The Hazing/Dead Scared) playing the brother (Shawn) of part 1s tour guide (Justin).

Hatchet succeeded by virtue of its simplicity: some twenty-somethings randomly get killed in gloriously gory fashion after some basic exposition about their mutant killer is sprinkled in for flavor. This sequel, however remaining playfully spoofy, tries to be more than its stage-setting predecessor, and this may have been its downfall.

The special effects in part 1 yielded outstandingly fun on-screen death scenes. A significant drop from 2006s $1.5M budget (which was utilized as best Ive ever seen), this sequel clocks in at $800K. And whereas some gore effects were great, the huge action gap between the opening kill and the third act was really quite boring and it wicked away the spoofy bad movie charm of the caricatured characters. That was quite a weak point.

But when the kills start to add up, it all gets fun again and perhaps redeems the film for those patient enough to suffer through the first 60 minutes. The ensuing macabre shenanigans include a sex scene kill complete and a double chainsaw killboth boasting some mean genital mutilationalong with more decapitation, torso-rending, impalement antics, a brutal curb stomp and a messy head smash. Theres even a rope-and-reel disembowelment followed by strangling someone with their own intestines. The effort is all there, but the execution doesnt always measure up to the original.

With a little patience, fans of the original should enjoy this even if it fails to do proper justice to its origins.",1521244800,,3298,5.223062381852552

8426947,5,B004EI2NOK,"Well needless to say, after watching and enjoying the first Hatchet movie I just knew that this one would be a very necessary watch.  I decided to rent this sequel from Netflix feeling uncertain if this chapter was going to do the first any justice.  Well largely to my surprise, this sequel did just that and more.

A Brief Plot Synopsis:  This movie picks up exactly where the last Hatchet left off with Marybeth(this time played by Danielle Harris), poking Victor Crowley in the eye to escape him. After being rescued and eventually left stranded by local crazy, Jack Cracker(John Carl Buechler), Marybeth follows Cracker's advice that he gave her before being thrown out of his house, to see Reverend Zombie(Tony Todd) to find out about a secret about her father that Cracker wasn't willing to tell her.  Well Marybeth doesn't find out about this secret pertaining to her father but she makes a deal with Rev. Zombie to get to go to the forbidden Honey Island Swamp where her father and brother were killed to deal with Victor Crowley provided she brings her uncle Bob along.  Her uncle while reluctant at first decides to go along with a crew of assorted weirdo locals.  As they set foot on the land by Victor Crowley's house, all he** breaks loose once again.

There's not that much to say or know about the new characters this time.  They're just a mixed bag of rag tag rednecks looking to collect the money that Rev. Zombie offered them if they can survive and even kill Victor Crowley.  They range from the weakest to the toughest.  Joining the group is Shaun's brother Justin(also played by Parry Shen) of whom is very worried about his brother and has no idea if he's alive or not.

The gore is still remarkable and the kills are even more intense than before.  There is some chasing going on here and there that is quite exciting as well.  Victor is still ripping apart heads, piercing heads, chopping off heads, using his belt sander, and whatever else he comes to do to kill anyone on his land.

It's awesome how finally much more detail is given in regards to Victor's past in terms of his total origin, who the vicious kids were that started the fire, and even an explanation of what keeps Victor alive.

My only criticism of this movie is the humor isn't as emphasized nor is the light-hearted campy side that was inherent in the first movie.  The comedy is here and there with no particular comic relief character.  That's a minor issue but still there could've been more laughs to be had in this movie.

There's not as much female nudity as there was the first time but the nudity that there is is definitely exquisite.

Overall, this movie proves a very well done follow up to the last movie as it: Gives the viewer more info on Victor Crowley, offers a higher body count, lots of great gore and satisfying kill scenes, some female nudity, gorgeous and sexy Danielle Harris making for both excellent eye-candy as well as giving her best performance since Halloween 5, beautiful cinematography and mostly well lit night shots, Tony Todd being bad-a** as usual, and most of all Victor Crowley still proving one deadly powerhouse of fear and brutal deaths.  Highly recommended!!!  10 stars out of 10!!!",1506729600,,3219,4.65017667844523
