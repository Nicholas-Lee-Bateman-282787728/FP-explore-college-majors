8315381,2,B000NY1ECQ,"This is an edited version of WEF: Going Platinum. Several of the fights from that event are missing as is most of the between round analysis.  Also, my copy appeared to be a DVD-r with an ink-jet printed label on the disc. I highly recommend WEF: Going Platinum (especially if you are an MFS fan - you get Matt Hughes, Jens Pulver, Jeremy Horn, Laverne Clarke, and even Pat Miletich himself) but would recommend you pass on this version which only shows about 2/3 of the event.",1201737600,2,477,4.482758620689655
