4138532,5,B003L77G1K,I am enjoying the series. I like to  be able to watch it when I choose. If you like the series this is the way to go.,1318118400,,117,3.3333333333333335
4138533,5,B003L77G1K,As always I love Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J. The really revealing character here is Mr. Deeks Eric Olsen and Daniela Ruah. They are such a funny combination and they look very good as a couple. Hats off to Ms. Hunt as well. She is a very convincing agent because of her size and looks nobody will look twice or even once that she has license to kill. GREAT SHOW MORE SEASON IS A MUST.,1317081600,3,387,4.105263157894737
4138534,5,B003L77G1K,"Second season of NCIS LA is as good as the first one.

As we already liked very much NCIS (very big success in France, second only to House M.D), the spinoff pleases us the same way as the East Coast serie.

The only thing I regret : on the West Coast, Gibbs is not giving claps with his hand on his team's heads. The humorous Hetty replaces him as she can !

I add for foreigners like me, that there is a great improvement in the second season for languages : we can see all episodes spoken in the original English, and French subtitled (or two other languages for subtitles). In the first season , zone 1, we had to listen the episodes in French language or in English but without subtitles.

Purchases highly recommended.",1317081600,,724,4.340740740740741

4138536,5,B003L77G1K,"I think that season 2 was even better than season 1. All the actor's have gotten to know each other and it all works. I hope this show does as well as NCIS. Love both shows bunches!!!

4138539,4,B003L77G1K,I want the entire 2nd season on DVD but the product package says only one disc.  Does this mean there are missing episodes?  Or only synopses?  Help?,1313280000,,149,4.444444444444445
4138540,5,B003L77G1K,"NCIS LA is just as exciting as the original, NCIS!  The characters are intermingled for just the right atmosphere.  Each week builds on the other week and this series has the stuff it takes to be the number one hit that it is.  I love the action, the humor, the comradery among the characters and the actors are very believable.  5 stars definitely!",1310342400,2,349,4.492063492063492
4138541,5,B003L77G1K,"""NCIS: Los Angeles"" enjoyed a strong second season as a spinoff of popular TV drama ""NCIS"", coming into its own as the West Coast Office of Special Projects, and taking on a variety of terrorism, espionage, and criminal cases involving the Navy and Marine Corps.

This season, the superb buddy team chemistry of special agents G. Callen and Sam Hanna (Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J) was augmented with a second, surprisingly effective team featuring NCIS special agent Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) and LAPD Liaison detective Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olson).  Deeks's rough initiation into NCIS and his humorous challenges in building chemistry with the skeptical Kensi were a recurring theme.  There were strong hints by season's end that Deeks and Blye were on their way to a real partnership.

Team psychologist Nate Getz (Peter Cambor) was quietly eased into undercover work; his place was taken by pert computer geek Nell Jones (Renee Felice Smith), who forced computer expert Eric Beal (Barret Foa) to step up both his professional and personal game.  Linda Hunt was priceless as diminutive but inscrutable Operations Manager Hetty Lange, whose unmatched experience and skills kept the whole team on its toes.  Rocky Carroll as NCIS Director Vance did some nice cross-over episodes.

The long-running mysteries of G. Callen's origins and Hetty's background came into sharp focus at season's end, as Hetty bailed on the team to perform an off-the-books mission into Central Europe.  Stonewalled by Director Vance and a new operations manager, the team quit en masse to follow Hetty into Europe, on what might be a rescue mission, or a colossal ambush.  The end game will be revealed in Season Three, just approved by CBS on 18 May.

""NCIS: Los Angeles: The Second Season"" is very highly recommended to fans of the show and of the NCIS franchise.",1305763200,36,1849,5.052631578947368

4139951,5,B003L77G1K,"Bought Seasons 1-3.

Love Season 2,  but with reservations & questions.

Season 1 was a great experience for me.  Do not like, what I see as a ""negative vibe on NCIS.  I chose to watch NCIS-Los Angeles because LL Cool J is one of my favorites & I wanted to see what he could do.  He was great in SWAT, so I figured I could watch a version of NCIS just for him.

I was pleasantly surprised with the character line-up for NCIS-LA.  Hetty & Kensi are great female characters.  I had been having trouble seeing Chris O'Donnell as anybody but Robin from Batman, but he grew on me.

Nate & Dom did not fit for me.  Could not quite believe either.

However, with the introduction of Deeks, near the end of Season 1, better character interaction was created for me.

Season 2 seemed to have all it parts working well, with the exception of the Hunter character in some episodes.  AGAIN, a negative aspect was introduced unnecessarily.

There are too many story lines possible for the NCIS-LA team to work with for the writers to throw in the negative aspect.

Work environments do not have to be antagonistic.

With that said, let's get to Season 3; Deputy Director Grainger.  Who NEEDS him to back stab Hetty; be heavy handed and disrespectful of the people who work at their jobs?

Having Director Vance make occasional appearances was fine.  Grainger, as a major addition, turned me off the show.

To CBS, get rid of the Grainger character.  I can only speak for myself and a few friends I spoke with about this.  You took a great show and working cast and screwed it up royally.",1420416000,,1574,4.464788732394366
4139952,5,B003L77G1K,Hey--anything with Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J---gotta be good.  I am just collecting the series---have watched them from the beginning!!,1418688000,,139,5.619047619047619
4140003,5,B003L77G1K,"Here is my impression of this second season:  SUPERB, TREMENDOUS, SENSATIONAL, MARVELOUS, COLOSSAL ....and its good, too!!
Yes, as  growing fanatic of the NCIS series, I must say these programs have enchanted me to no end.  I have come to love the cast, especially
Daniela Ruah who is as beautiful (and hot!) as she is complicated a woman.  It seems all these type of shows have people who have had problems
with their families or parents: Bones and her Mother, Beckett and her  Mother, Booth with  his Father and Mother, Lisbon (THE MENTALIST) with
her Mother, Castle with his Father (his Mother is a pain in the a** but alive) and of course Agent Callen and his family.  The other cast members are
good, even LL Cool J, though I think the name is goofy.  The other girl in the computer room  Renee Smith is cute as a button and I think is
developing a relationship with the other talkie tech Eric Beale.  But the stars of the show, I think, is Chris O'Donnell and Deeks (Christian Olsen)
though I have to add Daniela and Helen Hunt as marvelous players.  I am impressed by Hunts toughness and yet loyalty to her underlings.
I won't go into details of the episodes, though we are learning slowly about the backgrounds of the players and their preivious activities.  I
particularly like Deeks and Kensi and keep hoping their relationship will get stronger (and mushier!) as time goes on.  They are almost stealing
the show, and Kensi is up there with the Deschanel Sisters as a hot,  beautiful and extremely talented woman.  Magnifiquo!
  Anyhow, there are a number of  superb stories throughout the series.  I do not like LA , spending most of my life in Chicago and NY, but I
have come to respect it a bit more.  Some parts of the city look beautiful, others not so,  but I love the mountain terrains and palm tree lined
drives;  I would, however, miss the lack of el or subway complexes that I have spent so much time riding; I fact I worked for the Staten Is. Rapid
Transit (fairly rapid!) before I retired.  If the reader likes NCIS (the original) they will like this series.  I do miss the lack of a Forensic pathologist
or a Lab scientist like Abby who I adore, but the rest is first class entertainment.  I bought the first five seasons on DVD from Amazon and are
getting season 6 on my Video library.  I am in the middle of season 3 and it is excellent.  FIVE STARs!!!  Buy it!!",1418342400,,2387,4.462962962962963

The growth of their relationship as partners and now as a couple has really made the show even more enjoyable and created an active and passionate fandom who ""ship"" these two truly neat characters and also has a huge interest in the show's other characters and storyline.

4140191,5,B003L77G1K,"The reason I love this episode is that it focuses on the member of the team who is normally considered a class clown, and isn't taken seriously by his teammates (at least it looks that way). This episode changed that though.

***SPOILERS****

Deeks, a former member of LAPD, and now part of NCIS:LA, has been undercover tracking organizations that prey on children. Deeks has been emotionally shaken by what he has witnessed. Toward the end of the episode, he finds out that one of the LAPD officers he's been working with has been involved with those organizations all along.

He's arrested by Deeks' team, and makes a crack about the 'victims' to Deeks. Deeks gets so furious that he almost kills the guy. Callen and his team talk him down, saying ""Deeks, he's not worth it."" Ultimately, it's Kensi, Deeks' partner, who calms him down. He walks away, but not without laying a few punches on the guy, splitting his lip and knocking the wind out of him. When he says, ""You saw that! You all saw that!"" Callen goes, ""I didn't see a thing. You guys?"" ""Not a thing."" Just the right response.

This episode shows how even the comic relief can get a little serious, and righteously angry. It made for a refreshing change from the series (what I had seen of it until then, anyway), and made me respect Deeks that much more. I recommend it for anyone looking for good, solid, contemporary drama that gets the viewer involved.",1395100800,2,1418,4.615079365079365

Over the course of the season, I became more intrigued. When the episode titled Hand-to-Hand aired...I was hooked. Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen) brought with him a personality that is hard to ignore. I was praying that he would become at least a regular guest star, but was ecstatic when it became known he would be one of the main players in the show. The second season definitely picked up momentum. The relationships became more personal and the actors, while doing a great job already, have begun to loosen up. The interactions are more authentic as time goes on and they all become more comfortable with each of their roles. I can honestly say that I enjoyed this season immensely. Olsen, Ruah,  O'Donnell, LL Cool J, Hunt, and Foa ALL do such an amazing job. They have begun to feel more like a family. This show is now on its fifth season.

4141004,4,B003L77G1K,"When it comes to watching TV it seems there is better programming on these days than ever. Even compared to what folks consider the golden age of television there seem to be more shows on worth watching now then at that time. Even the spin offs, programs that link themselves to already hit shows have gotten better. Case in point, NCIS LOS ANGELES.

I was never a big fan of the original series NCIS (which stands for Naval Criminal Investigative Service) that took a look at the investigative unit for the Navy and Marines that focused on crimes committed involving either or. When I got around to watching it on DVD I realized why it was such a hit show and that folks were watching. With the success CBS had in generating 2 spin off shows in their CSI franchise it only made sense they'd try the same here. But NCIS LOS ANGELES while similar is completely different.

Rather than focus solely on the criminal aspects and turning the show into another police procedural, this one takes on more international criminals and more often than not terrorist activity. This is not a group that works regularly in the public eye (though with the number of shoot outs on city streets seen here it's hard to believe they've never been filmed or made newsworthy in their world). This is a more clandestine group preferring to go undercover in an attempt to thwart bad guys and terrorist on US soil.

I never got the chance to watch season one but came in with this DVD collection of season two. It kicks in right away with a thread that will involve several episodes throughout continuing to the shows cliff hanger season two finale. This involves the past of agent G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell) the teams leader. Callen continues to have flash backs of his past while still unable to remember it all. Various episodes here take on things seen in those flashbacks and just who he really is. On the surface he's the teams on the scene leader, the man who decides who does what and gets the job done. But even Callan answers to someone.

That someone is Hetty Lange (Linda Hunt), an old operative in the field who now focuses her attention on pulling together jobs for the team to take on. Hetty is in charge of the LA field office for this group and is a legend in her time. She also inspires many things in the team beginning with fear, respect and love. While cautious around her, the team would do anything to protect her and in fact do so in one episode this season.

The next important piece of the team is Sam Hanna (LL Cool J), the rough and tough partner for Callan, an ex-Navy SEAL member who's seen bad and good times both. Hanna is a conundrum of sorts, being the muscle on the team but at the same time its spiritual guide as well. Sam takes no gruff but also knows there are better things in this world.

The other set of partners are far different than these two. Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) is another ex-military agent whose partner was killed in season one. Kensi is the optimistic agent but never let it be said that she's soft. She's as deadly as any other agent and perhaps more so when need be. Her new partner is the team's liaison with the local police, Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen), a quick witted flirtatious member who jokes non-stop but who displays a serious side as well. Deeks may seem silly at times but inside he carries as much baggage as the rest of the team which makes itself known in various episodes here.

The team is aided in the background at home base by two tech geeks who supply them with backgrounds when they go undercover, information when they're in the field and support as often as needed. Eric Beale (Barret Foa) and Nell Jones (Renee Felice Smith) are unconventional when it comes to military protocol but the tops in their field when it comes to anything high tech. This team finds the buried information that helps lead the field teams to find the bad guys.

With the teams in place this show seems much like the original. The team works well together, each banters back and forth in a good natured way and the Kensi/Deeks team hints at a possible romance between the two eventually (though it never plays out in this season). The entire group is like an extended family, each one concerned about the other and with a closeness one can only wish they had. This closeness is so intense that by the last episode of the season the team quits NCIS to go search for Hetty who has disappeared.

The team is also one that you hope we actually have in place, a team that is willing to do what it takes to protect their country. Themes of loyalty, family and honor run throughout the season two set and all combine to make these character modern day heroes, something we seem to be short of or rarely hear of these days in real life. And its important that a young generation realize that there are heroes in this world.

Season two features the team taking on various bad guys throughout. Villains involved in human trafficking, stolen weapons, hijacked information, and terrorist's attempts on the country are all just a day at the office for this group. And while the occasional quip might be made after a case is solved, the team never takes things lightly or without a touch of personal psychological damage. But they pick up and do it all over again the next episode.

The cast involved here are amazing. O'Donnell has the charisma and intensity that many associate with Matt Damn in the Bourne films. He's a much unappreciated and underrated actor and it shows here. LL Cool J may just be another rapper to some but his acting chops have upgraded with each role he's ever played. That sharpening of skills gives his performances here the edge that is needed. Ruah and Olsen play their roles with an ease that seems natural to both. Their playful back and forth banter that has the undercurrent of a personal interest in each other is subtle yet there at all times. And Hunt as the enigmatic Hetty is a treasure. This is the role she was made for. No one knows for sure if the legends about Hetty are true or just legend, but they make a point of walking lightly around her while at the same time adoring her. It is in great part due to the performance Hunt displays here that the whole legend becomes believable.

The only bad thing one can say about this season 2 set is that it ends leaving you wanting more. But it will be some time before season 3 arrives. Until then you have to make do looking for the episodes on TV or streaming. Myself I tend to like to wait so that I can sit down for a few nights with folks that now seem like old friends. Once you watch this set you may feel the same way too. Now I just need to make sure and pick up season one.",1332806400,3,6702,4.439837398373983
4141055,2,B003L77G1K,"I was frankly appalled by the second season of NCIS LA. I had enjoyed the first season on blu-ray, and bought the second (on dvd, because blu-ray was not available). Unfortunately, instead of actual police drama and case-solving, each episode has now become a vehicle for building up to the main characters gunning down large numbers of people, instead of orderly crime solving and appropriate action as a result. The contrast between the nicey-nice depictions of the attractive-by-design characters and their death-squad behavior is something I find jarring and inappropriate. I'm gone from being a fan of this show, or ever watching or buying it again.",1332115200,2,654,5.179245283018868
4141056,4,B003L77G1K,"I keep forgetting this is a branch of NCIS because it doesn't have that military look that most of the military shows have. I don't find the communication devices very believable but they make the stories doable and gives the writers the ability to create stories ""out of the box"". The characters are working hard but don't seem to have much synergy going, but I can see them trying very hard to create a culture unique to this series. Maybe they'll get there. Hetty and Sam are the glue. So I'll keep watching the series just because the actors are trying so hard and for the entertainment factor.",1331424000,,598,4.546296296296297
4141057,5,B003L77G1K,"I enjoyed NCIS for several seasons but was unsure about the spin off. They rarely manage to live up to expectation, and for the few that do there's unsually a trade off in detraction from the original.

NCIS LA is that extreme rarity, it suffers from neither of these problems.

Character development is excellent, the interactions and human dynamics that are displayed by the team are superb.

The storylines are well written, if  bit action heavy for my personal taste.

The actors have been excellently cast and the sets leave almost no room for complaint or criticism.

Watching series one and then working through the shows sequentially is best as it keeps everything within a sequential timeline, but it's just as easy to watch individual episodes as stand alone shows.

The second series builds to an interesting climax around one letter, namely G, and culminates in odd corners of the world with badges on tables and agents on beaches, but they're not enjoing the good life.

The only detractor is it's hard to imagine anyone surviving so much gunfire without a guardian angel.

Even with the proliferation of these type shows this grows on you with each episode, it pulls you along, and you might just find yourself watching two or three episodes a night. I did, and I enjoyed every one.",1325894400,,1296,4.801801801801802

4141059,5,B003L77G1K,"I like it due to its offshoot of NCIS.

4141061,5,B003L77G1K,"Okay this is a great series and the pack is great but just one little thing I have come to hate on certain sets including this season and the previous. They print the episode guide on the inside of the main cover so you have to pull it out to read it and yes it made the front plastic cover part of the case split. What is this idea and what total idiot thought of it, obviously someone who doesn't buy dvd's and wants to read the episode guide. Come on its stupid and annoying. Otherwise great set and great features as well.",1320969600,,526,4.116504854368932

We also watch them while we are away they travel with us and at the price you can play them over and over.
