3078387,4,B00127IUA2,"This was a little different.  Usually the ""haunting"" movies deal with someone being scared, possessed or something of the kind.  The beginning can be pretty gruesome for some, the killing melee started off immediately.  I did enjoy the movie but at the same time, many of the movies on Prime seem to me like ""B"" rated movies.  This is my opinion of this one.  Keeping that in mind I was able to enjoy it, this was a good plot and it could of been done so much better.  The acting was okay some was and some wasn't plausible.  To say that a killing spree was on is a little unfair when you know that the ghosts only wanted revenge for the taking of their lives.  There were points were you know that things were impossible, people disappearing, blood and body parts cleaned up, I will say that the ghosts killed in a gruesome and painful way.  I did feel bad for the female lead when you find out why things happened the way they did but I was glad that at least she worked at trying to save herself and not the typical screaming, crying and curling up in a corner with me begging one of the other actors to get rid of her.",1405036800,,1122,4.205607476635514
3078388,4,B00127IUA2,"Alright, I don't know why I should have to say this, but some people still seem not to get it somehow...This is an OLAF ITTENBACH film. That means: laughable-to-mediocre acting, low budget everything, shot to video (or at least in a similar style), and last - but most prominently - ridiculous gore and violence. So, of course, that is precisely what we get in this film.

That said, I hadn't anticipated that this movie would be legitimately creepy at times, but it was. Granted, the other 90% of the time I was laughing or cocking my eyebrow as the convoluted ""diabolical plot"" story unfolded, so I'm sure anything with the slightest semblance of seriousness was surprising to me. Regardless, the make-up was done extremely well, and the blood was bountiful. The script was silly, but the story is actually pretty bad*ss. I mean, come on, rotting ghosts who vengefully kill anyone who steps into the house in which they were brutally murdered? Awesome.

The first few instances when Rebecca's father appear to her are, for me, very reminiscent of Pascow from Pet Sematary (or Jack from American Werewolf, take your pick) as well as a particular scene from Beetlejuice (which, incidentally, is my favorite movie of all-time). I saw these both at a young age, so perhaps I wouldn't otherwise have the fondness that I do for this flick. But even purely as a gorehound, this one delivers. And no obnoxious sex (or worse yet, rape) scenes. Kudos, Olaf! Oh, another element that I enjoyed (which is also probably because of Beetlejuice) was the lighting. This movie has a lot of blue, which I feel suits/sets the tone well. Sorry/You're welcome for yet another stream-of-consciousness ""review"".",1339545600,2,1690,4.905594405594406
3078389,4,B00127IUA2,"has done some good movies. My favorite is the very hard to find ""The Burning Moon"" this movie isn't near as good. A lot of it is VERY slow. I think a lot of the acting is bad. It might not be all the actors fault could be a weak screen play. I have never been big into paranormal activity horror. Ok this was passable. What I liked about the movie was of course the blood and gore and Olaf Ittenbach knows how to present that. The first 5 min.s of the movie is very good. I liked the movie BUT it wasn't great.",1317427200,5,510,3.9134615384615383

3078391,4,B00127IUA2,"I *beep* loved this movie! It definitely deserves more than 4.6 (the rating that it has on IMDB)! The first 40 minutes are pretty slow (not boring, just slow), but after that it gets really entertaining and it has A LOT of AWESOME gore (a few effects look pretty cheap though)! Oh and it has the craziest intro in a movie ever! The acting is bad, but I don't care (and no one should) because acting isn't important in low-budget gory movies, so I give it 8/10!

8244476,3,B00127IUA2,"For the genre this was not bad. Clearly the strongest part of this film was the story line at least until the end. There it became a little cliche. There was too much gore and over the top slashing/hacking. The pace was a little tedious at first and the dialogue a little pedestrian but not dreadful, it is clearly European which made it more interesting frankly. I would recommend this film to only a select few of my friends because of the gore.",1406073600,,447,4.397590361445783
