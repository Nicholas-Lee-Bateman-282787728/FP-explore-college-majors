8058487,5,B00099FNH2,"The video is presented in two halves.  The first half is Bob and Lefty's tips of the trade.  They take you thru how they like to use their glues, their vises, sharpen hooks, handle bucktail, etc.. This is done in a casual back and forth style.  Realize you are watching two legends at work, sharing their secrets.  What you are watching is greatness, unscripted and honest.  You can't possibly purchase better instruction.

The second half of the video is Bob showing how to tie the minnow and Lefty showing the deceiver.  Both segments are filmed such that you see the fly and what they're doing. Bob and Lefty go through do's and dont's.  This part was great, and though it's only 2 types, it is 2 archtypes, who's variety is limited only by the creativity of who's behind the bench (you).

This film is a treasure.",1325203200,,817,4.541095890410959
8058488,5,B00099FNH2,"I got this dvd last month. Lefty and Bob are  the go to men in fly fishing and tying. I have been tying for about 45 years myself and learned a few tips about tying. As I was watching the dvd I would look in the background and noticed all the materials they had. I thought I had a room full.
  I learned the right way to tie the Clouser flies. This is great for the beginner, they go thru a pattern step by step.
  This is one fantastic DVD I recommend it highly.",1203638400,3,463,3.882978723404255
8058489,3,B00099FNH2,"I am retired an decided that I wanted to learn how to tie flies. I bought a couple of books and read them. Since I live in a remote area with no other fly tyers near me that I know of,  I thought that it would be useful to buy a video so that I could actually watch an experienced fltyer at work. Well, this video was a real disappointment. It does show some basic techniques and useful tips. It also shows how to tie two specific types of flies - Lefty's Deceiver and the Clouser Minnow. However, in general it presents the information in a VERY disorganized and incomplete manner. I also felt that the video itself was way too short. It's really too bad, because the fly tyers in the video are obviously knowledgeable and very experienced. I really expected much more from this video than I got. It wasn't a complete waste of money, but it could have been so much better.",1186790400,9,873,4.290909090909091
