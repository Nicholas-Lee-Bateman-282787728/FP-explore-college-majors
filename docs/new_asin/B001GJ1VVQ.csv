8305488,1,B001GJ1VVQ,"I bought this DVD hoping to see many of the star stripper routines from the golden age of burlesque. What a total disappointment this disc is!! First the music is so annoying (jazz combo)and has nothing to do with the film footage and most of the routines are not on a stage and almost no credits are given to who we are watching. The most shocking is first we see Blaze Starrr's name and there is some footage of her dancing and talking but we don't hear what she is saying and after only a few  minutes we see Tempest Storm dancing beside a swimming pool outdoors in what looks like Palm Springs, CA. There is no introduction to her nor does her name appear so anyone watching this might think it is still Blaze Starr. Since Tempest Storm is still alive she should sue this person selling this awful DVD. The most complete routine and on a stage is Lili Sy. Cyr's bubble bath routine. As for Betty Howard she only dances and never removes any clothing so there is no strip tease. Most of the final scenes are young ladies lying on beds and rolling around, no stripping on a stage and one young lady is totally nude the entire time on the bed. For someone who has studied and taught about the golden age of burlesque and it's stars this DVD is a total waste of money. This is the second DVD I have ordered from Amazon hoping for good footage of these star's routines (the other, Burlesque! A DVD Documentary) was even worst than this one. The best is still Behind the Burly Q documentary. Forget about buying this DVD!!",1350777600,,1520,4.352112676056338
