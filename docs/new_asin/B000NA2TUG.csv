2763399,5,B000NA2TUG,This DVD takes you back to the wonderful Big Red Machine of the 1970's and that glorious 1990 WS. A must for any serious Reds fan.,1361923200,,130,4.038461538461538
2763400,4,B000NA2TUG,You don't have to live in Cincinnati to enjoy this bit of history.  The '75 game may go down as one of the best ever!  Just a great piece of nostalgia for baseball fans,1240099200,4,168,3.911764705882353
2763401,1,B000NA2TUG,I was a big fan of the Reds in the 70's.  This DVD is a major disappointment.  It is full of too close shots of players swinging the bat and Joe G. telling you what happened - you don't actually see it. Most of the game shots are of a player running or swinging the bat. Very few actual plays are shown.  Most home runs are shown with a close-up of a player swinging and then a cut to the outfielder looking over the wall. It almost felt like they didn't have the real game action and were cutting the story together from clips they had. All in all it doesn't capture any of the excitement of the 75 series. One of the best ever. 76 is much of the same.,1198972800,18,653,3.969465648854962
2763402,5,B000NA2TUG,"I was a big fan of the BRM when I was a tyke. I almost gave this a 4 because it does not do that team justice: they were one of the greatest teams ever, and frankly, at the very end of the original era in baseball: as the new series ""The Bronx is on Fire"" shows, the very next year, free agent reality created the age of the team of hessians. There's a sense in watching this of not really getting how these guys were so good that they just completely blew out the Yankees in 1976. Having grown up through the 75, Gowdy 'we was robbed' nonsense (that apparently cost him his job, and Snyder doing it on the news in NY), it was good to see them frame the series as a great battle and quote Fisk even as saying he was honored to play in Game 6.

It is great that quality stuff like this is available for so little money. I am going to look for some stuff that is more in depth, though.",1186272000,12,883,3.9329608938547485

8176284,5,B000NA2TUG,"If you're a Cincinnati Reds fan, you'll love this DVD.  It icludes the full MLB videos of three great Reds' World Series victories, 1975, 1976 and 1990.  You can see the ""Big Red Machine"" at it's best beating the Red Sox in 1975 and  the Yankees in 1976. The great ""wire to wire"" Reds who swept the Oakland As in four straight in the 1990 World Series are also featured.  It's a great DVD that  belongs in your library.",1414886400,,419,4.253164556962025

8176286,2,B000NA2TUG,"The editing, film & story total was very shallow & simplistic done in this video. I wish the video was as good as the Reds were those three years. If the video payed more attention to Joe Morgan, Tony Perez & Lou - 1990 Reds Manager- the video would have been much better.",1362700800,,272,4.150943396226415
