7960462,5,B0000648XI,"I just loved these DVDs, we bought every one that's been released and want more! Many of these we remember from our grammar school years. I can hear the clik-clik of the old projector, and smell the classroom scents of crayons and paste. These films don't have commentary, they are shown as they were intended to be seen. They are hysterically funny, and since they weren't meant to be funny, that makes it MORE funny! Anyone who watched films in schoolfrom the 50s through the 70s will get a kick out of these DVDs.",1103932800,,516,4.5
7960463,5,B0000648XI,"This is the first DVD in this series that I have watched, and I was blown away.

My two favorites have to be ""Shake Hands with Danger"" a Caterpillar-financed safety film featuring countless construction mishaps set to a country western soundtrack, and ""Purely Coincidental"" featuring some of the most earnest over-acting you'll ever see in an educational film.

Also not to be missed is ""All Together"" a 1970 Lou Rawls narrated recruitment film trying to get more African Americans into the Navy.  Right on!",1032307200,6,507,5.011904761904762
