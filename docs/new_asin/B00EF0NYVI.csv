5910618,4,B00EF0NYVI,"The gem of this bunch is Funerals are Fatal. At one point in that story Poirot mentions something that someone said, but shouldn't have said. ""That was stupid of her, wasn't it?"" asked Rosamond Shane, a niece to one of the deceased characters herein. Poirot shook a forefinger at her. ""It shows you, Madame, the dangers of conversation. It is a profound belief of mine that if you can induce a person to talk to you for long enough, on any subject whatever, sooner or later they will give themselves away.""

And in Funerals are Fatal it was something one person said which could not possibly be true and once you realize that, that this person is the murderer, the explanation of the crime falls rather easily into place. Of course, if you miss this one sentence then you will find yourself in big trouble as to who did what to whom. Of course Poirot, unlike readers such as myself sometimes, never misses anything.

Cards on the Table and Taken at the Flood round out the balance of this set (along with the Mystery of the Blue train which is afflicted by a stale performance by the otherwise accomplished Elliot Gould).",1379289600,24,1121,4.5721393034825875

5910660,1,B00EF0NYVI,"The Mystery of the Blue Train-- Horribly overacted, played for high camp;  bad hair (Lennox) and ridiculous miscasting of Mason and Knighton.  While the original book was convoluted and contained many subplots, this ""adaptation"" chopped, cut and pasted the story way too much. The book was quite good, this film, not so much.

Cards on the Table-- Hands down the worst of all of Poirot.  I absolutely loathe rewrites, particularly when they are unnecessary and they not only fail to improve the story, but actually make it worse.  From one of Christie's most interesting stories, this ""adaptation"" is much more concerned with inexplicably reversing two character roles;  eliminating a key murder;  creating a filial relation where none existed and, as usual for this series, anyway, the introduction of homosexual relationships (here, two) that were not in the original story and worst, making one of these invented relationships the entire lynchpin of the mystery.  Despite good performances, the butchery done to this story makes the CD it's on a good frisbee, nothing more.

After the Funeral--This is the strongest entry in Season 10 and one of the best in the Poirot series.  Several liberties taken with this story, yet, unlike the horrible Cards on the Table, this filmed version's liberties are almost excusable.  Some characters were eliminated or condensed, which helped the storytelling, while others were unnecessary and added nothing to the exposition.  The real jewel here is the brilliant Monica Dolan as Ms. Gilchrist.  Her performance is stunning and makes watching this, totally worthwhile.

Taken At the Flood -  Whoever adapted this to film either was illiterate, ignorant or just arrogant.  The title is taken from Shakespear's Julius Caesar and in sum, refers to how some may benefit from the misfortune of others.  Christie's tale was one of opportunism.  Unfortunately the writers of this filmed version completely missed the point, made a change that was both unnecessary and which completely altered a main character's entire motivation.  Sadly, this is the third worst adaptation in the series.  Don't get me wrong, of 70 films, there were only four real dogs, this is one of them.",1424649600,,2208,5.18361581920904

5910674,5,B00EF0NYVI,"We purchased ""Poirot: The Early Cases"" a year or so ago, and became hopelessly addicted to Poirot mysteries! We have since acquired some of these later series, and they are still of such high quality and character that we watch them over and over again.
One thing I've sadly noticed on these later offerings is the insertion of bad language here and there, and some bedroom scenes that really aren't necessary.
Otherwise, David Suchet 's portrayal of Poirot is still so perfectly played, and once in awhile Capt. Hastings and Ms. Lemon even show up, adding to the sparkle and fun of these wonderful series.

What's a bigger concern to me when I buy these DVDs is the quality.  In the past, I've had discs that ""Freeze Up"".
Then the entire set has to go back and to make sure that the replacement set hasn't got the same problem, hidden in one of the other discs, you have to watch them all, all over again.  This has to be finished within thirty day or Amazon won't replace them.  Kinda ruins the enjoyment when you have to do someone elses quality control work and you can't
save an episode or two to watch on a rainy day.  This set did have a ""Freeze Up"" but after 2-3 seconds it continued.

I don't know if this featurette has been included on the DVD version or some other version of ""Poirot ,""  but it is not been repeated in the previous Blu-Ray Series numbers 1-9, and interviews with the cast members from Series 10 indicate that it was a new special taped during that time.

5910684,3,B00EF0NYVI,"It was really good news to see lesser known Christie stories dramatized, but not so good news to view unhelpful, even annoying changes from the books.  I am glad to hear that #10 is a dip and that these get back on track.  Overall, there is the change as to the solo status of Poirot, without his previous sidekicks, who added warmth and camaraderie.  But, the change is true to the stories and reflects accurately the aging detective, whose circumstances of life change as his friends move on with theirs.  With such a large canon of titles, we do have a good portion with the old gang.

Since another group is doing these recent ones, alterations in style can be expected.  They still hold the quality of production, the skill of David Suchet, but disappoint with storyline changes.  Unfortunately, they go even further with very unedifying modernizations, which it is charitable to even call gratuitous in some cases.  In ""Cards on the Table,"" for instance, the adding and treatment of the homosexual element served no one.  If it was to be realistic and/or deferential to a segment of lifestyle, why did Poirot treat it with such marked reproach as he did with the detective particularly?  Served no one.

I appreciate being informed by a reviewer the significance of the title ""Taken at the Flood.""  That was a puzzle to me, not knowing the Shakespearean quote. To count the positives of the set, there is enough salvaged from editing to resemble the actual Christie stories.  And, adding a ""positive negative,"" these have not been as grossly hacked as the current day Marple offerings.  And again, there is a large group of the beloved Masterpiece Mystery adaptations available to have and hold and definitely re-enjoy through the years.  Hence, it is still possible with these newer ones to cut the losses and move on.",1403395200,3,1825,4.80448717948718

A&E also censored the audio for language they felt offensive and re-edited the shows to put in commercial breaks.

But now we can rejoice!  Acorn has gone back to the original British masters, restored the widescreen image as it was produced, and the audio is uncensored.

5910696,3,B00EF0NYVI,"Some things are very hard to mess up or turn to something catastrophically bad. Agatha Christie's Poirot stories combined with the acting of David Suchet are one such combination. It's a recipe for success.

Any joy or success that the tenth series of Poirot had was due to this combination, but the result was a mediocre series of feature length telefilms.  When you had someone a recipe for Prime Rib and you end up with something that tastes more like Hamburger steak, you have to ask why.

The answer is a creative team who decided to change some of Christie's stories. I've been clear in the past that I can stomach or even enjoy some revisions. I'm a huge fan of the Series 11 episode Appointment with Death which arguably is the most radical departure from Christie's original story in the entire first twelve series.

The difference between Appointment with Death and the episodes in Series 10 is that the telefilm of Appointment with Death was actually a well-thought out story and its revisions held in a very cohesive narrative and there was an actual point in mind

The addition in Series 10 stories on the other hand seemed to randomly insert revision with names changed and characters motivation being different for no particular reason whatsoever.  These were obvious hack elements inserted into a much better story.

To be fair, Mystery of the Blue Train was not one of Christie's favorite stories, but the additional changes such as having a rich man (Elliot Gould) having locked his disturbed wife in a convent or giving the idiot husband of Lady Tamplin a major role in the denouement of the story made the telefilm vision worse.

However, Cards on the Table should have been one of the best stories of the entire program's history. The premise was brilliant: four different detectives  invited by the mysterious Mr Shaitana to dine with four sleuths and four potential murderers invited to dinner and the host is murdered. And arguably it was looking that way for the first seventy percent of the film as we saw the detective interact. It continued until the writers felt the need to insert some Jerry Sprnger-appropriate sexual situations including one of the detectives having hired the very creepy Mr. Shaitana to take compromising photos of him.

The best episode of the season was After the Funeral which was the most logical and consistent story the whole season and didn't tamper too much with Christie's original plot except for the addition of another Jerry Springer sex situation.

Finally, we had Taken at the Flood which has two problems. One, the villain is too obvious and second is more central to the essence of the story.  The title of the book comes from Julius Caesar, "" ""There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to fortune..."" which is about taking advantage of an unexpected situation that comes to you. In the book, the villain takes advantage of an accident that occurs to gain power and wealth. In the telefilm, the incident has been changed so it's no longer an accident and thus title Taken at the Flood no longer makes any sense. Bravo.

This isn't to say Series 10 wasn't without its good moments, but these were often undermined by horrible production decisions and writers who haphazardly rewrote Christie's stories in ways that just didn't work. Series 10 adds gratuitous sex but  loses a lot of intelligence.

Having seen all the Series 11 episodes, the good news is that Poirot films did get better. Thus Series 10  marked a dip in series quality rather than a legendary and irredeemable ""Jumping the shark"" season",1392681600,11,3599,4.789983844911147

5910699,4,B00EF0NYVI,"This is, as one would expect, well acted, and well directed and filmed.  The plots are excellent.  Our only complaint is that these later stories seems to be darker than the earlier ones.  There is no Miss Lemon or Cpt. Hastings to lighten the mood, and the majority of the characters have evil in their pasts or in their hearts, even if they didn't commit this particular crime.  For entertainment, we find them a bit too sad because of the plight of the cast in general.",1391644800,2,472,4.453488372093023
5910700,5,B00EF0NYVI,"Remastered for a high-definition presentation, the video and audio quality are astounding.  Now the viewer can see and hear every obscure clue that Monsieur Poirot eventually uses to identify the murderer in the room (who always happens to be sitting among the other suspects, despite Poirot's infallible reputation as an investigator who never fails in catching the bad guy).

I'm teasing.

5910706,5,B00EF0NYVI,"This series continues the quality established by prior Agatha Christie Poirot productions. David Suchet remains the crafty Belgian detective we have all come to love and each show is entertaining and satisfying to the end.

8604858,5,B00EF0NYVI,I love the Poirot series. They have closed captioning and David Suchet is hands-down the best Poirot ever protrayed.
