7902892,5,B000003K7P,"Turn the channel on the television,  a comet cuts across the screen, behind it trails a...sword of stars.  The interpretation of the past can always be perceived in more than one way.  This episode shows that  beautifully, along with finalizing the idea that, yes, here is a man who is  something more, here is the Sisko.  In a loop of more than 60 episodes, it  shows that Benjamin Sisko is a man of destiny.  It still fills me with awe  every time I see it and I have seen it more than ten times already!
  Upon continued thought I realize that ""Destiny"" is the second episode in a vital three-episode sequence dealing with the early development of the Emissary.  The sequence commences with the pilot, ""Emissary,"" where Kai Opaka informs Sisko of his true destiny.  Next is episode 61, ""Destiny,"" with which this review essestially deals.  The final member of this triad is episode 89, ""Assession,"" where further proof is given to the Sisko and all remaining doubt is erased.
  It is my feeling that watching these three episodes is a must to fully appreciate the beauty and nuances of the seventh season,
which brings this story to a close of the greatest of all Star Treks.",958348800,,1178,4.618357487922705
