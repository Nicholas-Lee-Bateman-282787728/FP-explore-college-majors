4514279,5,B0050ITR4W,I would definitely recommend this album.  The music blended well with the movie and is great to listen to at home.,1360972800,,114,4.428571428571429
4514280,1,B0050ITR4W,"This movie had a lot of promise and started well.  The main character was well done and believable.  The plot was thrilling and smart--not the typical Hollywood car-chase, shoot-em-up adrenaline rush.  Having said all that, they ruined everything good about this movie with an unbelievable 9/11 conspiracy theory twist near the end.  Not only is the plot twist stupid, it's been done over and over again--the US government and the CIA are behind everything wrong in the world, blah, blah, blah.  In this movie, the government conspires to prop up drug dealing and terrorism--wow, that's brilliant.  I've got news for you, drug dealing and terrorism are thriving on their own without government help.  Most of all I'm just angry at another potentially good movie wasted with a staggeringly foolish storyline.  Skip it and save your time.",1347580800,13,836,5.095588235294118
4514281,5,B0050ITR4W,"I didn't know what to expect.

What I got was beyond unexpected.

I'd watch a beer commercial with Brian ""Hannibal Lector"" Cox, so that got me into this film, even though I'm numb from all of the post-Iraq/post-Afghanistan tragedies played out on the screen.

This one will tax the patience of those who can't handle heavy cockney accents. I didn't notice if there were ""English"" subtitles because I see so many UK films and go there often; but, if there are, I suggest Americans make use of them.

What makes this film spectacular?

Not the acting - which is solid - or the directing - which is commendable.

It is the ""twist"" - wherein we put the whole tale together and understand what the ""war on terror"" myth is really all about.

Fiction, you say?

There is compelling...HUGELY COMPELLING...evidence to the contrary.

Who really benefits from the rampant drug peddling in our hero's rundown apartment complex?

Who really is behind the ""terrorist plot"" that is the centerpiece of the film?

Frankly, I'm surprised they even got this released...and not at all shocked that I never heard of it until stumbling across the film at Netflix.

You're either going to adore or despise the revelations; the difference, sadly, being a reflection of your consciousness regarding ""what lies beneath...""",1342310400,3,1296,4.921658986175115
4514282,5,B0050ITR4W,"The star of this film, Toby Kebbell, does a knock-out job playing a Solider whom just returned home to London from Afghanistan.
He meets up with his best mate, whom was in Afghanistan with him, and the story begins. Twists, deception,drugs,terrorist cells, action galore and a ride of a film.
I won't go into detail for I see other comments have basically given the movie away by telling you scene to scene.
Want to see a great film with an incredible under-rated actor? This is it!",1341792000,4,482,4.616279069767442
4514283,5,B0050ITR4W,"This is a flawless depiction and the gold standard to compare any other film in this or a related genre to.  It is the definition of understatement and understated personalities in this work.  Don't read anything else on it, as most people will complain and spoil out of ignorance of either the subject or film making in general.  It is also R-rated for a reason.",1340755200,2,363,4.553846153846154
4514284,5,B0050ITR4W,"I can't decide whether or not the story told in The Veteran is plausible, but the character played by the lead actor is definitely appealing.  A veteran of the endless war in Afghanistan, afflicted with PTSD, but completely lacking in self-pity and enormously resourceful, Tobey Kebbell plays this difficult role perfectly.

Throughout The Veteran, the viewer has the feeling that if just one normal person without a lot of baggage reached out, the unusually capable and self-reliant protagonist could become just about anything he wanted.  Instead, he is forced to live his life in a domestic war zone where his few friends are fair game and pathetically vulnerable.  From a guerilla war in Afghanistan to urban free fire zones in his homeland, Kebbell's character doesn't have much of a chance.

The story is even more compelling because the lead character's innate decency plays a conspicuous role in shaping the arc of his life.  Combat hardened and proficient though he is, there remain some people on whom he cannot bring himself to inflict terminal violence.

Urban working class Britain is an ugly place to come home to.  When the only people you meet are vicious thugs and their victims, it's not only ugly it's potentially deadly.

Brian Cox is not at his best in a supporting role that he plays in an offhanded, by-the-numbers way, but Tobey Kebbell is great.  His performance makes this film really effective.  Hard to believe that the same actor is versatile enough to have played crackhead Johnny Quid in Rock'n'Rolla.",1338336000,2,1532,4.9921259842519685
4514285,3,B0050ITR4W,"Other reviewers pointed out that it is gritty, the character development is good, the acting mediocre, the action realistic, etc. All true. The plot twists are, admittedly, clever. And those are the reasons that I gave it three stars.
Now the downside.

BTW - if you do want to see a movie along a similar theme, done perfectly and professionally, with the same film-noire atmosphere, the same grey skied semi-nihilistic English settings, see the extremely good Harry Brown, starring the spectacular and subtle Michael Cain.

.

OK - bottom line here. Throughout this movie we are introduced to a number of characters. We develop , if you will, a 'relationship' with them as we are expected to do with most movies. But here is the breakdown.
There are two people in the movie whom we really like. the female lead, a frightened yet brave heroine working as a double agent.
And the hero / antihero who wants to do the right thing, and who develops deeper feelings for the female. There is also a young black man who wants only to keep his young charge from getting deeply involved with the gang / drug world in their town.
Every one of the nice people gets killed. Hero gets butllet in chest in final scenes, gasps out last breath while young teenage punk who murders him, sneers.
There are any number of scumbags in the movie , but the two who stand out are a drug / gang boss, and a young punk who just wants to kill someone.  They both live and carry on in the drug trade. So - if you don't mind investing your time and emotional energies in people who are all going to be killed, while the killers go their merry way, then go for it. But for me, it just left a bad taste in my mouth.",1336521600,40,1744,4.278787878787878
4514286,5,B0050ITR4W,"A couple other reviews describe this movie well. Its a ""War Vet with an attitude"" movie I expected to be a 'C' and was easily an 'A-' just because its done so well. The underappriciated Brian Cox plays the Gov't official 'bad guy' here who recruits our parartrooper war vet 'hero' to eliminate underground terrorists hiding in the UK. Of course with Brian Cox in the role you know dbl-cross and lies will certainly surface and that's what happens to our hero 'the Veteran'. The scenes involving 'urban combat' with a drug dealers 'soldiers' are really well done and the ending while brutal, and not easy to watch, 'concludes' the film in a depressing, but satisfying way.",1335571200,,671,4.743589743589744
4514287,4,B0050ITR4W,"By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

The Veteran tells the story of Robert Miller (Toby Kebbell) an Afghanistan soldier returning home to South London. He finds a rundown neighborhood taken over by gun-toting gangs. Robert can't find work but his skills don't go unnoticed. Jones (Ashley Thomas) a local drug lord offers him a job as part-body guard, part enforcer. Our proud veteran turns him down.
He eventually finds work through an ex-army mate (Tom Brooke) doing undercover surveillance for a couple of questionable government operatives (Tony Curran and Brian Cox).
Robert is supposedly keeping tabs on suspected terrorist cells. He learns, however, he's caught up in a conspiracy where the good guys and the bad guys blur. In order to survive he has to shift back into his role as a soldier but this time the battlefield is at home.
Robert becomes a reluctant anti-hero. The director of The Veteran had two characters in mind when developing the story - Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) and William Munny (The Unforgiven).
One of the underlying stories within The Veteran is a hopeless love story between Robert and Alanya, who is in deep cover, within the conspiracy. He wants to save her from hurt because he's seen innocent women die in Afghanistan who he couldn't protect.
The Veteran is bleak, gritty and a rather hopeless tale, but it's still worth a watch.
The ending reminded me of Gran Torino.",1333497600,12,1423,4.929166666666666
4514288,4,B0050ITR4W,"""There are over 2,000 terrorists operating in the U.K. alone and that number is increasing daily."" Miller's (Kebbell) army enlistment is over and he is not sure of what he wants to do. When he meets a group headed by Gerry (Cox) he finds his niche. Along with his new found friends he begins to hunt down and eliminate terrorists and a local gang of drug dealers. Having seen many of the recent war movies in the last few years I went in expecting to see long and boring (like 90% of the others). I was very surprised by this one. While not an amazing movie by any stretch this is a very good movie that is comparable in many ways to ""Munich"". A small group hunts down and tries to eliminate the bad guys one by one. Saying that pretty much sums up what the movie is about and while the acting is not great it is still very much worth watching and better then 90% of the movies that have been like this recently. Overall, a surprisingly good movie that deserves to be watched. I give it a B.",1330646400,2,991,4.193717277486911

In my opinion (solely based on the ending, which was terrible) the director clearly wanted to send a message that soldiers are bad and drug dealers are not so bad, the last 5 minutes of this movie has to rank among some of the worst script writing I have ever seen.

Also out hero finds himself in a less sophisticated war fought on the streets where young man weaponized by the big guys terrorize their community.  If it sounds like peaceful civilian life is doomed, it really is.  Our hero learns that all too late.

The acting and character development are simply superb.  We care about this hero and the female double agent caught in this terrifying open-ended war.

The makers of the film wanted to put out something more than just the usual ""Hollywood do good, good guy gets the girl and the popcorn"" like we usually see in the junk that Hollywood is pumping out. Enough of the feel good baloney. Life is life and its not always going to come out good.

The double cross did take me by surprise and yes I was sorry to see the good players all killed off. But this is a  gritty tale of life in a dirty world.

The story line was mediocre with the usual ""CIA is pure evil and is funding Al Qaeda"" and it really didn't go into him having to deal with coming back from Afghanistan. It showed his apartment in the beginning and him banging his wall a few times with some radio chatter in the background as he went into a PTSD moment, but then it turns into a confused shooter movie.

Seriously, this film has the British OAS, or what ever they're called, being the ACTUAL terrorists, training Al-Qaeda to pull attacks at their behest.

One, as for them movie. Up until the last 5 or 10 minutes it's a interesting enough movie. After that, I'm not sure what was the goal. Like some other reviewer said, I wish I could have my 90 minutes back.

Two, many of the reviews here talk about how this movie so accurately portrays the struggles Veterans experience upon returning home. Let me say, I DO NOT deny struggles. But, my concern here is, it seems the average citizen cannot conceive of a Veteran having anything to offer of than the power of the sword. Or here in America those evil black rifles. We've been told that Veterans are killing machines.

Ironically, this movie plays on the stereotype that the CIA is running the World, all the while using another stereotype, namely, those in the military can't help but kill. Either way, a gullible populace is rule for the day.

If you watch this movie, may you then actually go out and meet a Veteran. Speak with a Veteran, get know a Veteran. Then ask yourself, why does the government lie so much about Veterans?",1386028800,2,1137,4.504854368932039

What I did not like: The old saw about how the CIA is the root of all evil; the hero running about part of the time with an M4 that is missing a rear sight, who wins in the end.

Overall, I think it is interesting enough to watch once, but not twice.",1383350400,,403,4.025
4514578,1,B0050ITR4W,"The veteran tried to cover all the bases and left you guessing WTF was that supposed to be about? At fist it leads you to believe that it's going to be a vigilante justice movie with the protagonist dealing out PTSD fuled pain to all the thugs in the naborhood. Character introductions to the gang controlled estate initially seem to support this plot. All the ingrediants are there, the friend having a hard time with the gangs complete with troubled little brother and oh let me guess he needs help bring down the big bad leader. The gang leader wants something from the reterning veteran, his skills and knowledge of warfare and is also ready to step in as the antagonist. The old army pal at at the pub that will reluctantly but eventually join the fight and be the hero he wanted to be in the war. Stereotypes are all present and reporting for duty but nobodys home to take roll call, because plot twists without a plot are just nonsensical.

Then the movie switches and trys to dramatically deal with the protagonists stress and pain over the war. brining up a battle that went south presumably involving civilian casualties. Suddenly they drop the first half of the movie and try to go somewhere between ""The Siege"" and ""Killer Elite"" in plot and style. With the protagonist running a source like hes been a handler his whole life. After a few brief car rides and short conversations the writers hope you'll just buy an undying love between the veteran and his good looking informant. strong enough love that she would risk her life to rescue the veteran from and encouter that really didn't make any sense other than as an excuse for the woman to be a hero. Then after begining this connection the two arbitrarily deside she needs to go away. The point I'm trying to make is that major plot changing events are decided on the fly with little regard to the audience and not enough build up for any buy in.

Spoilers ... really its not going to ruin it for you, it will probly save you 90 minutes that you will otherwise never get back.

At this piont its my firm belief that the writers relised two things 1. how many loose ends they had left and 2. that they weren't coherent enough to keep their stuff wired tight for the next 15-20 minutes of movie. So they decided to kill everybody. Everybody but the gangleader, crime pays. Really I can't make this up, it's like the writers just watched a bunch of vines and tryed to let each scene be its own deal. Then they end it with some gun violence.

Bottom line as a prime member I guess I watched this for free but I'd rather have the 90 minutes back. Although if you are a prime member just jump to the end watch the last gun fight as a vet myself it's about as close as the movies usualy get. Also, it ends about as well as one lone gun man going up aganst many should he gets shot right in the face!",1381795200,13,2858,4.376647834274953

It contains a lot of violence and is largely about violence.  At one point I thought this might be based on a novel, because I thought the writing was well developed.  The plot has a realistic quality and even though not all plot twists were surprises, some of the details of how they were carried out were terrific.  It has a more realistic edge to it than popular ""war porn"" movies like ""Hurt Locker"".  But viewers who are preconditioned by Hollywood formula for happy endings, will not enjoy this one.

Strong dialogue with the exception of one short villain-explains-it-all-in-case-the-viewer-is-too-dumb-to-figure-it-out scene.  A lengthy firefight scene that includes good guys as bad shots, the need to reload, and other uncharacteristically accurate aspects.

The only possible draw back is a thick accent for one or two characters, but since so much is carried by the acting, even if you don't understand it, you won't miss much. Most of the actors have a quite pleasant, easy to understand accent.",1377216000,,756,5.5964912280701755

In this story there is the added fact of the soldier living in a low income housing project with a resident drug dealer/gang leader. The story gives the feeling that if the soldier could get along with civilian employers, and have a ""normal"" job, he could have avoided all the turmoil.
But he finds a job in covert law enforcement that turns out to be administered by corrupt socialist types, and as usual, falls in love with a double agent, that he eventually has to rescue.
Only it doesn't turn out so well for him in the end. Made me wish for a good old fashioned ending.",1372982400,3,644,4.330578512396694
4514590,4,B0050ITR4W,"I know that this sacrilegious but I would compare this in many ways to ""Taxi Driver"" with better acting. Comparatively, this was a far more controlled rage that was more nuanced and simply more credible. I love the carnival sense of the characters in Taxi Driver but this movie played to a raw, gritty street credibility. Herein was such a tempered performance that along with the script is sheer genius. In the end nothing is resolved and I think it is a very important message as it relates to this theme of political intrigue and war. The politics are left leaning and the message is that war is big business and terror is the new method of sheep herding and everybody is a pawn. ""We're in the g.o.d.(Guns Oil and Drugs) business where our moral authority is our military might. I expect great things from these writers and this actor. The flat affect of post traumatic stress and the volatile misdirected rage boiling under the surface are spot on and nothing short of masterful.

The only difference is that this film basically has a pretty unknown cast with the exception of Brian Cox from ""The Bourne Identity"". I thought the acting was very good and the story quite believable, especially the monologue that Brian Cox's character gives near the end.

Having said that, we may proceed. The plot twist at the end was, Right. On. Target. (another reviewer blasted it for being unrealistic. WRONG.

Sorry to whomever said Tony whats-his-face (lead) was one of the better underrated actors out there, but this guy is flat as a board.  I mean, he's ""ok""... certainly not the worst... but if I had to write a theme song for this movie it would be titled ""It's OK.""  He's ok (the lead actor), the storyline is ok, the flow is ok, the characters are ok, etc., etc.  Nothing super special here.

Since at the time of my viewing the official description on Amazon.com for this movie is obviously incorrect (North Africa? 1960?  ETA: this is the description for Deserter), here is some relevant info about the film:  young Brit man who's back home in London after serving in Afghanistan gets involved with helping ferret out terrorist sleeper cells.  He likes the double-double agent lead-female character.  He is a consummate bad-ass and single handedly beats up entire groups of bad guys - a la Bruce Lee but without the martial arts mastery.",1363305600,7,1163,4.679802955665025

8451257,5,B0050ITR4W,"I have gone back and watched this movie more than once.  It's pure fiction, but very realistic in its premise and process.  Similar to John Wick in a way, our anti-hero isn't shown as invincible and rarely has any strategy that's all that perfect.  While he can gain the upper hand at times out of ambush tactics, the enemy has the numbers and he has insufficient intel and manpower to ever be truly victorious.  So the violence simply escalates, and we're left with the real fact that NOBODY wins a gunfight - period.  Even when you live through one, it's never the end of it - whether scarred physically, emotionally, or subject to revenge violence - this kind of behavior doesn't end well for anyone, and should be avoided with all possible means.
