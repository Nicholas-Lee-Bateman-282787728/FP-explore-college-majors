7308930,3,B010CVV2AI,"Not needing to summarize what this is about as you can read the other reviews. I will say I have never read the light novels and am basing my thoughts on only the anime. It was at best 3 stars. The characters were highly annoying, lead by Enju. There was more crying and whining than I could stomach. The villains were weak and the pacing was rushed at times. Even the main character, Rentaro was unimpressive. For me, the best part was when it ended. It may appeal to you, but not me. I would suggest you watch a couple episodes first to make sure you like it before purchasing.",1446681600,3,579,4.2727272727272725
7308931,4,B010CVV2AI,"This series was a decent one... however I've been an avid reader of the light novels for a long time so being able to see all of my favorite characters animated with voices was, honestly, enough for me. The series itself from an anime-only perspective was disappointing and just an average one, maybe even below average if you try to think about it critically. I rate it a 4/5 due to my love for the light novels and how hyped I was from seeing the anime just to see it all animated, but the actual rating the anime itself deserves is none greater than a 2.5/5.

The main problems with this series is the lack of inner monologue for Rentaro, the perception of Enju as a character, the overall ""feel"" of the series, and most importantly, the pacing.

Rentaro was jam packed with inner monologue within the light novels. Anyone who's read them will agree. However, like most light novel adaptations go, they completely forget about inner monologues because they know people who haven't read the source material will find inner monologues incredibly boring.

Enju as a character within the light novels is given tons more impact and will overall be a more lovable character. Even though she is treated pretty badly in the anime series, within the light novels it is MUCH worse. You're generally able to appreciate and respect her more as a character to the point where you're actually jealous of how strong she is as a character. The way she is treated allows more impact to be placed on her for when a certain something happens later on in the series.

The overall feel to the series was destroyed within the anime adaptation. What is actually a deep, borderline psychological action series in the light novels is turned foremost into a loli-harem in the anime. It's actually pretty sad seeing as how the series has everything it needs to be a great one in the light novels, but focusing on the large amount of nymphets just to draw more attention and boost sales was a poor choice by the animators. It really brought down what I thought was a great light novel series.

And ending with the most important one, is the pacing. Think of other popular light novel adaptation anime series'. Sword Art Online. The typical episodes-per-novel adaptation ratio was about 7:
Season 1: Aincrad arc, 14 episodes, two light novels. Fairy Dance arc, 11 episodes, two light novels (both significantly shorter than Aincrad's LNs)
Season 2: Phantom Bullet arc, 14 episodes, two light novels. Calibur, 3 episodes, 1/3 of a novel (about 9 episodes per novel), Mother's Rosario, 7 episodes, 1 light novel.
The Devil is a Part-Timer, 13 episodes, 2 light novels.
High School DxD, first 2 seasons, 24 episodes, 4 light novels. 6 episodes per light novel.
The 3rd season was 3 light novels adapted into 12 episodes, however it was intentionally skewered a bit. Ishibumi Ichiei, DxD light novel author, decided that the 3rd season should have the 3 novels rearranged in a different order as he thought it would flow together a better storyline than he wrote (which it did, season 3 was the best season of DxD hands down). As such, some things were removed.

There were also a lot of less-important light novel adaptations, such as Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata or Juuou Mujin no Fafnir. Both of those series' received a 12 episode anime adaptation that covered 2 light novels.

So, as you can see, the typical norm for light novel adaptations is about 6 or 7 episodes per individual novel. That's typically what it will take for things to not be rushed. It is a lot easier to tell a story in TV animation show form than it is to tell a story through a book, as actually seeing things will help a story to be told as opposed to just having to read every single detail. So, to have about 2 hours of content per book (which typically takes anywhere from 4 to 6 hours to read) is pretty perfect.

So, what about Black Bullet? In the 13 episode anime series, 4 light novels were covered. That's right, FOUR. The content of FOUR light novels was covered in a span of 13 episodes.
That's an average of 3.25 episodes per light novel. As every episode of anime has 20 minutes of content minus opening and ending themes (and commercials if you watch it in Japan itself), that's basically 65 minutes of content per entire novel. That also doesn't even take into account any recap time given at the beginning of an episode... which is something that every single series I listed above had either none or very little of. Black Bullet didn't really have a lot of recap time either, but did have some.

With how long the Black Bullet light novels are, it doesn't take a genius to realize that 65 minutes isn't nearly enough time to cover the contents of the entire thing. I don't think I really even need to continue talking about this... it's just pretty obvious at this point that the series was extremely rushed.

So, as I said above, I'd rate the anime series on its own accord a 2.5/5. It's still enjoyable, despite being a bit below average. It's just really hard to dis-include the epiphany of flaws the series has. However, if you've read the light novels (at least up until #4), you're bound to enjoy the series if you liked the light novels. You'll probably rate it a 4/5 like I did as well.

Thanks for reading and hope this helped!

7308932,5,B010CVV2AI,"Five years ago, the Gastrea destroyed large parts of the world. Today, we follow Rentaro Satomi and his partner Enju Aihara, civil servants who destroy rouge Gastrea in the Kanto region of Japan. All civil security agents have pairs, one Promoter (Rentaro) and one Initiator (Enju). Initiators are all Cursed Children, youngsters born with the gastrea's blood infecting them, outcast from society. Promoters are humans (mostly) with unparalleled power, capable of fighting alongside their Initiator companions.
Thirteen episodes, running to the end of the Third Kanto War arc. A kick to the feels every episode or 2 will keep you down just long enough for the action to hit like a fire.",1439078400,6,686,5.133928571428571
7308933,5,B010CVV2AI,"MINOR SPOILERS
I love this show. I've heard of people comparing it to Attack on Titan and calling it a lame knock off, but really it isn't. It may be somewhat similar with the setting but that's all. It takes place it a post apocalyptic world where a virus which turns people into these monsters which are determined to wipe out humanity. The story revolves around Rentaro and his initiator Enju who fight these monsters. They tend to joke around a lot at the begging of the show while transitioning to more dark themes involving Rentaro, Enju, and humanity.

Story: The story was really good with excellently done action scenes. I really felt it for the characters throughout the story. The only part I didn't like about it was the plot holes they left in some of the scenes for their past. Also I didn't really like how they almost turned him into a crazy dictator like figure similar to Shu from Guilty Crown. Otherwise a very well done plot.

Characters: I really appreciated the relationship between Rentaro and Enju. He really almost seems to be like a father to her, despite her proclaiming she's going to marry him. Kisara was kind of an anomaly in the show I guess? She was really kind and understanding throughout the show especially towards Rentaro. But then she becomes some psycho who lives only for revenge? Overall the characters are fairly well developed but have some inconsistency.

Music: I have to admit I loved the soundtrack. It fits almost perfectly in the action scenes transitioning well from periods of sadness felt by the characters in the show.

Animation: The animation wasn't groundbreaking or anything in comparison to some others but the landscape scenes are starkly beautiful. The only part I didn't like is how they animated a few of the monsters. It really seemed out of place the way they looked.

Opening/Ending: I can not get enough of them! I love the music so much it draws me into it every time!

Rating:
  My Personal Rating: 9.5
  Rating of the Show with Flaws: 8.0
  Overall Rating:: 8.9

7308934,5,B010CVV2AI,"In the future, a pandemic called Gastrea nearly wiped out the human race.  Evolving the infected into monsters which kill and infect others, humanity hides in a few cities behind monoliths made of Verundium, which not only weakens the creatures but allows them to be killed.  However there is another weapon humanity has - the lost generation.  These girls were infected with Gastrea, but have the ability to fight the monsters toe-to toe, but at a cost of the virus taking over after using their powers after a certain amount of time.  This follows a pair of Security agents, a watcher and his partner as they not only try to live day to day but have to deal with discrimination, hate, and fear.  The only question is, who are they protecting - and why should they?

This was a great series, it has everything.  Humor, love, action, and the darker side of humanity - fear, hate for a group of girls who are different, and also fear of the future.  I say give it a watch and see what can happen if fear controls civilization.",1436140800,5,1025,4.5027027027027025

7308954,3,B010CVV2AI,"The other reviews summed this anime up well so I will just say a few things. Its a decent watch and has some unexpected turns that keep you interested throughout the series. I was hooked by the story and the main character was more of a badass as the series went on. The anime reminds me of Darker than Black in some aspects (mainly the walls around the city and the pending doom). I was put off by the loli-harem parts of the show but they do try to keep it funny and not sexy.

I feel like this anime tried to be too many things and that's why I gave it 3 stars. Its funny, action, serious, adult, loli, harem, apocalyptic, mysterious, vague, and so much more. They introduced a cool story idea and several interesting characters but never really go into their backgrounds or the why/how they ended up on the sides they did. I feel like there is a lot going on in this world and we only get to see one guy and his partner defeat a set of monsters. They may answer some of my concerns in the manga but as for the show it has some holes. I would just take the story for face value and you won't be disappointed. The show was surprising if anything.",1453161600,,1148,4.147982062780269

7308956,3,B010CVV2AI,"I like the story, but There is rather a lot of swearing!  the GD word being most used close second SH then the F word. I know it seems weird that i'm mentioning something like this, but i really don't like swearing and there seems to be more and more swearing in anime. I desperately hope swearing won't become prevalent in anime. even though it seems like it will. I'm glad that fan service seems to be reducing, but if swearing is going to replace it then i wish someone will at least say an anime has swearing in it so i would know before buying. I always try to find out if a series has fan service or swearing in it but usually only find out about the fan service.",1449273600,2,669,4.106870229007634

Wish it coulda run a little longer and flushed out some more hinted at story lines but it had a pretty well rounded ending that didn't leave you hanging and completely frustrated so I appreciate that.

8722046,4,B010CVV2AI,"Fun, fast paced, action-packed, cute, cool, hilarious, and heartbreaking all in thirteen episodes. The main partnership of Rentaro and Enju is very easy to fall in love with, and many supporting characters are also easy to like. The villains were interesting whether they were despicable or sympathetic, and the world-building wasn't bad. It may not break the mold for shonen action series, but it still does it very well.

The reason I give this four stars instead of five is because the show is in desperate need of more backstory and a second season that I don't expect will happen. Guess I'll be getting the light novels now.",1484524800,,629,4.824074074074074

The survivors are forced to live within the Monolith walls, that includes materials that able to harm these parasites. The only way for human-kind to combat these creatures is to utilize cursed children that have traces of the virus in them. They are partnered up so that they can be guided and form a tag-team with them.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Due to its relatively serious plot and nature, there's plenty of dark things portrayed in this anime, which serves as a reminder that reality is harsh and cruel. Those that are unfortunate or aren't strong enough will be victimized by others. While there are some silly situations to break up the drama and suspense, the anime is still pretty serious and shows much death and carnage, as well as scenes that may generate sympathy and/or empathy from the viewer. Luckily, that's what the cute girls are for. They help break up the seriousness of the anime in small portions.

- Analysis: Humans in reality and the virtual world generally will struggle to survive. Even when life throws its punishment, humans in general have been known to persevere. This anime showcases many of the people that have their own reasons for fighting. Most of them would rather die fighting for what they believe in rather than living a peaceful life. A respectable mentality to some, or an irritating perspective to others.

 It would also seem that many of the characters simply want to be recognized as being human. Unfortunately, discrimination and fear go hand-in-hand in this anime, making that seem almost impossible. Which is sad. But some foreshadowing gives implication that it will get better with each new generation. Thus, giving meaning to the word hope.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Contains 13 episodes on 2 Blu-rays. Run time is about 5 hours long. Which is normal for a 12-13 episode anime. Rated TV-MA for violence, blood, and some fan-service.

- Conclusion: Overall, great buy as this is an interesting anime with cool characters and fight scenes. An interesting world with creepy and deadly monsters that attempted to wipe out the human race. The character interactions also draw some emotional appeal, as well. There's moderate fan-service. This anime is more suitable for male viewers due to the genres that it consists of.
