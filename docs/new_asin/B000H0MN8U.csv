8135702,3,B000H0MN8U,"I spent my vacation watching numerous B horror movies and happend to see this film on sale for a penny on Amazon. It was worth a penny but not much more than that. I don't expect people who love big budget films to love this film and it could have been better. The movie plays like a home video more than a motion picture and was hard for me to watch. I love B horror movies but this is more of a slasher film than a horror film. Yes there are what looks like zombie soldiers but that isn't until almost the end of the movie. Scream Queen Debbie Rochon is in this movie as the main star entering a fort that looks like hell. The acting is terrible but all B movies actors are terrible so I was not expecting much from the acting category. It just could have used more horror and less slasher. This film would have played better with the Zombie soldiers instead of a slasher who dunnit flick. I would suggest that if you are not into low budget films stay away this will disappoint you. If you are into low budget slasher films than this might just be ok. And I mean just ok, because great or original it is not.",1295395200,,1111,4.124423963133641
8135703,3,B000H0MN8U,"I picked up ""Fort Doom"" cheap and really didn't expect too much from it.  It turned out to be a pretty decent slasher film set in the old West.  Scream Queen Debbie Rochon stars as a madam moving her trade to Missouri, where she has recently inherited a house, after the Civil War.  Coming along for the ride are her sister, two prostitutes, and a young  photographer the sister befriended on the train.  Once they arrive in town they meet some strange characters: the creepy mortician(played by Billy Drago), the not too welcoming sheriff, and the seemingly friendly town doctor.  Then bodies start piling up.

At first the killings are blamed on Indians, but Rochon and her group have other suspicions.  There are more murders and then the killer is revealed, but there's another plot twist in store.

""Fort Doom"", despite its low budget, has a professional quality about it.  The filmmakers were careful to write dialog that was realistic of its era.  The sets and costumes were also very good.  My rating would have been higher had there been any extras on the DVD.  We get to see some bloopers during the end credits, but that's it.

If you're in the mood for something a little bit different in the horror genre, give ""Fort Doom"" a try.",1169424000,5,1242,4.637614678899083
