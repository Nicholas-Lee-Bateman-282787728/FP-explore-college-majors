7966140,5,B00006ADE1,"I bought this DVD at a local movie store. I was torn between this one and the episodes when Eriol first comes in. I wasn't sure if I made the right choice by getting this one. Now I know I did!
The DVD first starts out with Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo and Meilin in the city, shopping. The dream card appears and shows all but Meiling a daydream. Tomoyo has a dream of Sakura wearing her costumes. Syaoran has a dream of himm giving away the cards to Sakura! Sakura has a dream about the dream she has been having, the Sakura in her dream gives her a strange message ""It will definately be all right"" which offsets Sakura a bit.
Then the movie continues with The casting of the class play of ""Sleeping Beauty"" with Sakura cast as the Prince and Syaoran as the Princess. But as they were practicing the sand card attacks!
Then they all perform the play. It is going well (even though Syaoran overdoes his part a bit). That is untill the Dark card attacks. But with the help of the Light card which was in Sakuras heart, Sakura saves everyone and the play.
Finally, Meilin is baking a cake when she gets a call from her mother that she must go home! Sakura invites Meilin over and we find out about Meilin and Syaoran's past. Twin card attacks and Meiling and Syaoran use their martial arts skills to defeat it. Syaoran tells Meilin that she isn't a nusicance and doesn't get in the way. She leaves happy.
This is by far better than the dub version. I absoulutly love the music! I love the opening theme and I love the song that plays when Sakura calls her wand! This is definately a must see!",1055548800,9,1587,4.311036789297659
7966141,5,B00006ADE1,"And the road goes ever on...(Got this one as a Christmas present, but whatever works!)
This round begins with a non-dubbed episode wherein the four center kids, Tomoyo, Shaoron, Meilin, and Sakura, go out for the day, and are visited by the Dream card, that shows all but Meilin some very interesting daydreams!
Second, the roles for the class play in the school arts festival are doled out, and while Sakura and Shaoron are rehearsing together, they get ambushed by the Sand card. Also undubbed.
In the third episode, yet another undubbed(Whoo-Hoo!), two of the most powerful cards yet arrive in the middle of the aforementioned school play, which, by the by, is Sleeping Beauty - with Sakura as the Prince, and Shaoron as the cute-as-a-button Princess!(With costumes designed and made by Tomoyo-Chan, of course! And I thought the gender-swapped Cinderella done by Toya's school was a riot!) Just remember Sakura, Dark cannot survive without Light!(And visa-versa.)
Finally, we close out on an episode that did make the dub cut, and for good reason! In the wake of the Twin card's arrival, Meilin's mom calls and tells her in no uncertain terms that she's coming home! The subtitled is definately worth the trip for the opening scene wherein Meilin gets said call, and the flashbacks that reveal the origin of her and Shaoron's relationship and engagement(okay, so I was wrong, it wasn't by parental arrangement. What do you want, the dub chopped that scene!).
Next, the Earth Card, Keroberos, Yue, and...the Final Judgment! Bring...it...on!

7966142,5,B00006ADE1,"Highly entertaining, cute, funny, and action packed is just a few words I would use to describe the 4 episodes in this DVD.
Episode 40 - Meiling, Sakura, Tomoyo, and Li decide to spend some time together shopping, with Li finding it harder and harder to hide his feelings for Sakura. The Dream Card shows up and shows her a glimpse of the near future and her upcoming confrontation against ""The Judge.""
Episode 41 - Sakura and Li prepare to rehearse for their class play, ""Sleeping Beauty"" when the Sand Card interrupts and almost swallows them into the ground.
Episode 42 - The day of the play and everyone dresses up for their parts, Sakura playing the part of the handsome prince and Li as the sleeping princess?!? All goes well, except that Li gets nervous on stage and goes slightly overboard when playing his part. The Dark and Light Cards appear and warn Sakura of the coming of the Judge, Yue. Who is he and should Sakura be concerned, YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!!!
Episode 43 - Meiling receives a call from her mother to return home. We see a glimpse of her past with Li and why she fell in love with him. Sakura and Meiling decide to have a slumber party and Sakura convinces her that she is important to Li's goal to capture the Clow Cards. Her advice is put to the test when the Twin Card appears and it takes Li and Meiling Martial Arts ability to stop it.",1036886400,14,1364,4.395256916996048
7966143,5,B00006ADE1,"In this 11th volume of Cardcaptor Sakura, the Clow Saga of the show is drawing to a close with 4 great episodes. The Disc feature her pinkish-black outfit from Ep. 43 against a yellow background.

*Sakura and Sakura from the dream - Sakura and the others' outing is cut short by the dream card. Tomoyo begins seeing multiple Sakuras while Sakura confronts the form of herself that she has been seeing in her dreams. What does it have to say? Rather what shocking revelations does the Dream Card reveal to Shoaran?
*Sakura, Shaoran, and a sea of sand - The class decides to perform the play of Sleeping Beauty. Everyone randomly gets a role with Li and Sakura as the leads....in opposite gender roles! Li is embarrased as he and Sakura practice lines one day before school, but the magical moment is halted by a sand storm!
*Sakura and the Pitch-dark Litery fest - It's finally the night of the play and everything goes accroding to plan (with the exception of Shaoran's bad acting) until every thing goes black. Sakura must seal the mystery card before it engulfs even herself.
