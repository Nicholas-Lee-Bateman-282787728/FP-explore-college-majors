8439555,5,B004S7G6MC,"I based purchasing this dvd set on the reviews of J Zangari ""phikus"" and D. Saewitz ""Switz"" reviews and the fact that I was at this show as well as many others. Dead on reviews! This by far is the best video release by Phish in quite awhile. While being at the show is a totally different experience than watching it on a TV, this dvd certainly captured the exuberance of the night.

I got to talk to the hand held onstage cameraman, Marty, at the 2nd show in Amhesrt just after Utica. He said that all the shows are being shot for archive purposes only. If the band decides it was a great show, they will release a dvd. Marty said that everything is being shot in Hi-Def, which explains why the online clips look great last year. He also said the hardest part of shooting these shows was that he had to train 2 camera people every show to run the studio camera and the other hand held camera. There are only 4 guys in the video department that travel with the band. Who do I need to talk to about applying?!?

Hoping this year will be another great outing. I have tickets for 8 shows so far.",1334275200,,1092,4.195238095238095
8439556,5,B004S7G6MC,"I remember getting Vegas, and while I enjoyed the show, odd choice for dvd release, and no attempt was made to capture the granduer of the light show. Walnut Creek boasted a display of phish aligning with weather, just didn't see the magic. Brooklyn I thought was a great ""2.0"" performance, but still the dark and down of phish yrs IMO. Coral Sky was neat, and good lord the Clifford Ball captured the Clifford Ball, but Live in Utica is finally a dvd that captures Phish being Phish that make the off nights ok and anything better completely mind-blowing. I feel that Alpine Valley showed a great performance that was very rehearsed, the band was out to hit the notes and play a setlist to prove that they were back and more was in store. Live in Utica seemed to show Phish getting onstage practiced yet unrehearsed, ready to have fun and give the tiny venue in the armpit of NY a special night. The 'Good Times Bad Times' was more than appropriate as the entire evening the band seemed to have a tight but loose approach that was as precise as a matured band need be. More importantly is the band and the audience being there to have fun. With plenty of setlist weaving and extremely fun guyute teases, I feel this DVD release finally captures the magic of the light show and the band's approach to musi that makes them who they are.  THE CD'S ARE A NICE GESTURE BUT FREE FLAC DOWNLOADS TO ANYONE WHO PURCHASED WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS OF A WASTE. STILL FIVE STARS B/C DVD IS SUCH A PERFECT REPRESENTATION OF A GREAT BAND.",1318550400,12,1520,4.428571428571429
8439557,3,B004S7G6MC,"my ""almost....part 1"" review concerned the alpine valley 2010 DVD release....while musically it was a solid show, i had suspicions about how ""true"" the 16:9 aspect was. coming on the heels of that release is ""live at utica"", another release from 2010. this time i was impressed with the visual experience, and there's not much for me to fuss about in that regard....very nice-looking show. however, this time, unlike the alpine valley DVD, the performance is kinda rusty IMO. trey teases ""guyute"" and ""wilson"" often in the first set, which normally would be worthy of mention just for the ""fun"" dynamic; however, since the full versions of ""guyute"" and ""wilson"" were lethargic at best on this particular night, the teases come off as painful reminders moreso than nods to greatness. even sure-fire jam vehicles like ""david bowie"" and ""run like an antelope"" appear to lack confidence, and sound in danger of derailing at any moment. the band returns in the second set more focused & disciplined, but for a $30-ish price tag, a casual customer might debate if that one set alone justifies paying that kind of money.

if you're looking for a nice representation of current phish soundwise, alpine valley 2010 is the way to go. if you want a nice-looking show, then utica 2010 is your best bet, but keep your expectations in check with the performance....",1309392000,5,1351,4.899563318777292
8439558,5,B004S7G6MC,"It's a great show.  Music aside, this is a very well shot DVD.  I wish it was a little less ADD and the shots were a bit longer, but it's better than any DVD before this.  The soundboard mounted cam is amazing, but I wish they used it more.  Overall, one of the best if not the best shot Phish DVD.  Definitely worth picking up.

(And musically it's great too)",1308441600,3,360,4.071428571428571
8439559,3,B004S7G6MC,"i knew before buying this set that the cd's were not the complete show. however, i did not know, and nothing anywhere will tell you, that some songs have been shortened. Antelope is missing about 5 minutes of its ending (the best part!). it just ends mid buildup. pretty big letdown.

bottom line: you're buying this for the dvd's. the cd's are a bummer.",1307750400,17,354,4.53125
8439560,5,B004S7G6MC,"Great show for the band to pick for this DVD release and man did they do it right!  Sound and picture are top quality and the band is in top form.  A must have for anyone even remotely into Phish!

And I wonder what happened to Page's right ring finger tip during set break?  Get the DVD and you will see what I'm talking about.",1306540800,2,328,4.0
