5636150,3,B00BKQ12F0,"A Promise To My Father-Tim Gray  This documentary shows that the Holocaust still has far reaching effects on the survivors and children of survivors.  It would have been wonderful to find the family treasures, but would he had a fight to claim them and get them home?  More heartbreak? Our histories as individuals give us a frame of reference for who we are.  While we are responsible for the people we become, understanding those who went before us give us an appreciation/understanding for our current settings.  It's an interesting venture.",1374364800,,544,5.0

I was raised by people who had numbers tattooed on their arms and my heart went out to them for all their suffering.

This documentary follows Mr. Arbeiter through a return to his home in Poland and recounts the difficult times he and his family (and many others) suffered through during World War II.

5636160,2,B00BKQ12F0,"This is one of probably hundreds of documentaries and movies, some based on actual events, others not, about the Holocaust that I have watched in my lifetime, and it is among my least favorites. The subject of this film is among many who are melodramatic and tend to repeat the same stories as their male peers. It's not that I don't believe the Holocaust was anything less the the most horrific tragedy of the 20th century, it's just that I am starting to wonder whether the memories that seem to be repeated over and over by different people are things they all experienced or simply  memories of events they have heard about? I believe, for instance, in everything I've heard and seen about Josef Mengele, but how could so many who survived have actually laid eyes on him? There is no way he could have examined every prisoner at Auschwitz or that only the ones he did examine survived to tell their stories. That's just one example of an event or experience that perhaps only a few survivors saw or experienced but many repeat as if it also happened to them. The subject of this documentary is bad at embellishing, which seems to be the case with most male holocaust survivors who participate in documentaries. I have a hunch female survivors are more honest, or at least less likely to embellish. Women featured in documentaries rarely show signs of emotion, or drama. This, to me, makes them more believable. Still, God bless all of the survivors and their families. And thank God they lived to tell us all what those evil, disgusting, monsters did.",1467676800,,1555,4.675182481751825

It is also a shining example of incredible triumph over adversity and devastation amidst impossible conditions. It is not enough to tell a sad story- there are plenty of those about the Nazi genocide. It is even more important that eye witnesses speak of the human experience, and how they have overcome the trauma. This is a brilliant story of hope and caution to "" never forget"" .

5636216,5,B00BKQ12F0,"I like to watch Holocaust documentaries that focus on the human experience and have been able to watch several really engaging ones here on Amazon, especially via Prime instant video streaming. ""A Promise to My Father""  is a compelling documentary that traces the journey of 87-year-old Israel Arbeiter, or ""Izzy"" as he is known, back to Poland to revisit his memories of growing up with his family, and of surviving the horrors of the Holocaust.

Izzy lost his parents and 7-year-old brother in the Holocaust, and his oldest brother was last seen in 1939, and never seen again since, presumably lost in the great tragedy that was the Holocaust. The title of the documentary refers to the promise Izzy's father extracted from him, just as the ghetto they were living in was being liquidated. Izzy's father reminded his son to carry on, and preserve their traditions, words that Izzy lived by ever since. When questioned why he thinks he survived unspeakable horrors such as living through various labor and concentration camps, including the death camp Auschwitz, Izzy attributes it to God watching over him, an unshakeable faith made all the more remarkable given the terrible losses suffered, and the harrowing events experienced. The one thing I was disappointed by was the failure to find the family relics buried in Izzy's old family home in Poland back in 1939. I hope Izzy has found some measure of peace within through his journey back to his old homeland.",1389657600,9,1464,4.9471544715447155

5636224,5,B00BKQ12F0,"Poignant and presented in a way that follows Israel Arbeiter's journey (1939) through the nightmare years of Nazi terror. The teenager from Plock, Poland, returns to his home in 2012 and narrates his own path thru the complex of concentration and forced labor camps in Nazi Germany. 'A Promise To My Father,' is the acknowledgment of his father's last sustaining  words to 'Izzy.' This personal journey offers words of remembrance to two different school groups and for the young Germans words of forgiveness. To those of his own generation who would deny knowledge, there is anger and for those who tried to help a recognition of their angst.

Intertwined in the narrative is his meeting with a young girl. Anna's path crosses Izzy's several times before they meet once again in a DP camp. Marriage, moving to the United States, children and grandchildren give meaning to these two Holocaust Survivors. An incredible journey that leaves one with a feeling of 'hope.'

 Comprehensive, easy to understand, and an intriguing journey.",1378771200,2,1031,5.0828402366863905
