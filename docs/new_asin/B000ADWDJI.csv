Having this collection brought me back to the great times growing up on Saturday mornings.  All of the characters are there.  The Looney Tune collection doesn't just focus on Bugs Bunny  and Daffy Duck. Now that I have children, I have introduced them to the characters and they love watching them. I highly recommend this collection.",1214524800,3,464,4.621951219512195

Nevertheless, that is true, but it just is a shame that this generation who is more into greats like Spongebob Squarepants, and Rugrats, really doesn't understand the majestic great like Looney Tunes. Arguably, the animation that Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and company have made over the years, has still withstood the test of time, and a revival with the highly hyped Golden Collections, but they also have made that into a road-block as well.

The Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection, is a 6 disc DVD collection, consisting on snippets from the highly hyped Golden Collections. The first two volumes, the premire and spotlight collections, fair well by bringing in some of the greats from Warners' classic era such as the legendary Chuck Jones gem What's Opera Doc?, the Chuck Jones cult gem One Froggy Evening, the fast and furious Speedy Gonzales, and so many more. While they have faired well, they just have been broght on as a cheaper alternative to the bigger and better Golden Collections. The animated here however, has been remastered fairly well, but the audio has been tuned to a different tone on some classics, and not the original themes most die hard fans really have known for years.

The third volume, fairs as the real winner: The Movie Collection. Instead of highlighting what is considered as half of the Golden Collection like before, here all that there happens to be on this project is a pair of Warner Brothers cartoon full-length greats: The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie, and Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales, a more welcomed departure from the 2 previous volumes. The movies here are just as funny and hilarious with elements and snippets of great classic cartoons within each film such as Duck Dodgers In The 24th 1/2 Century, Ali Baba Bunny, Tweety & The Beanstalk, and so many other looney treats. Here, the movies and the artwork have been beautifully restored, and overall fair as the actual winner in this multi-packed cartoon bundle.

All in all, the Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volumes 1-3 is fairly adequate, but for die hard fans, it really isn't at all worth the dollars it delivers. For anybody who does want their looney fix, I honestly suggest you get the movie collection seperately, and the two previous Golden Collections and the just recently issued Golden Collection Volume 3 instead. That definitely is all folks!
