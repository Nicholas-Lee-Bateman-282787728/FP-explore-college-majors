8155231,5,B000K9I37I,"Senator Findley has been ""a voice in the wilderness"" dealing with this issue for decades. His moral stand has resulted in incredible harrasment and the loss of his political career. AIPAC directly funded his opponents and was directly responsible for his losing his seat in 1982.
[...]
Findley's arguments are logical, intellegent and well-researched. He deserves great respect for coming out for human rights on this issue decades before the current changes in opinion that allow people like President Carter, Walt & Meresheimer & other notables to speak out.
The video is good, consider it a short intro to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and how the iron grip of the Pro-Israel lobby here in the US perpetuates the conflict, by denying justice.

Think for yourself--look beyond the hysteria. What is the issue REALLY about? Is it really a 2000 year-old conflict that we should just stay out of?

Or is it simply the theft of another people's land?",1216166400,8,950,5.044585987261146
8155232,5,B000K9I37I,"Thoroughly researched and a very, very convincing thesis/book. Findley's book is loaded with shocking but believable cases of the abuses being perpetrated on a ""Spineless Legislature."" You will not put this book down, as Findley's revelations will keep the pages turning in utter shock! WOW!!!",1189382400,7,293,5.533333333333333
