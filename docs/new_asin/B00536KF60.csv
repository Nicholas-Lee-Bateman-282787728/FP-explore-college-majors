8455015,4,B00536KF60,"I just managed to catch this film on TCM very recently and found it to be solid entertainment.
The photography, special effects and stock footage were quite good for 1931 black & white.
It held my attention and I watched it twice (recorded). Of course, I was struck by the sheer beauty and poise of Fay Wray.
She was incredibly sexy in a modest way. It's of interest to note that Jean Harlow was originally
picked to play the love object in KING KONG but was not available; all the better.
This film, DIRIGIBLE, is currently unavailable and deserves to be reissued in that it relates to the
earlier days of airplane and dirigible flight and although the story is fictional in the exploits depicted,
it is not that far fetched at all. Directed by FRANK CAPRA.
