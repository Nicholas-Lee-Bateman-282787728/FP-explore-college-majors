8219741,1,B000VSDN32,"If you're looking for the ultimate movies directed by Yuen Wo Ping, give this one a miss as you'll do better watching Jet Li movies. However, there is one film, Born Invincible, that does live up to the namesake of martial arts essential, as it features some of the most awesome fight sequences ever captured on film.",1373587200,,317,4.578947368421052
8219742,5,B000VSDN32,"I bought this collection with low expectations and was absolutely thrilled to find out that two of the movies are absolutely great.  Of the remaining four, one is crazy enough to warrant another viewing and the remaining three I found to be exceptionally boring.  But, that's okay that only two of the movies are great because they are so great that they totally warrant the purchase of this collection.  Those two movies are 'Invincible Armour' and 'Dance of the Drunk Mantis'

----------------------------------

'Invincible Armour' is just plain great.  The first 10 maybe 15 minutes are kinda slow.  But, when the main character starts fighting, you'll notice because he'll beat the crap out of everybody and it's *awesome*.  This movie has a *lot* of fights in it and they're all cool.  In fact, it has so much fighting in it that I actually felt a little exhausted watching the movie (a good problem to have if you're watching a Kung Fu movie!).  Every actor in the movie is very skilled and it shows.  The fights are incredible and just plain well-done.  You won't have the irritating problem where every sound of people getting hit or blocking an attack is this loud, slapping sound.  The sound actually varies! That, and the main character is just awesome.  It actually looks painful when he hits people.  The storyline is decent enough to enjoy, but it certainly won't blow you away.

In short, this is a great movie and I totally recommend it to anybody who likes Kung Fu films.

-------------------------------------

'Dance of the Drunk Mantis' is also a phenomenal movie.  The fighting isn't as frequent and exhausting as in 'Invincible Armour', but there's enough and it's paced well enough that you won't spend a lot of time begging for the next fight to start.  Also, the fights are cool.  And, as one of the other reviewers stated, the fight between Sam the Seed and Rubber Legs is phenomenal and is also in my top list of most awesome fight scenes.  It's very memorable.  That scene also happens to feature some of the most hilarious dialogue you will ever hear out of a Kung Fu film.  I don't want to spoil the fight, but just know that it's a fight between two masters and they did a great job of portraying that atmosphere.

-------------------------------------

The video quality for both movies is about the same.  They also have the best video quality out of all the movies in the collection which really isn't hard to do.  But, both movies are still very watchable.  The only real problem I have with the quality of these two movies is that the sound, for me at least, is *really*, *really*, *REALLY* low!  I had to crank up all the sound settings on my computer considerably before I could get it to a decent level where I could hear it.

Anyway, these two movies will most likely be the best reason for you to buy this collection and they are worth it.",1287792000,3,2881,4.679282868525896
8219743,5,B000VSDN32,"For any fan of martial arts films this collection is essential. It contains one of the best martial arts epics ever filmed (Invincible Armour) and is worth the purchase price just for this film alone. But it dosn't stop there ,you also have (Dance Of The Drunk Mantis) the sequal to Jakie Chans (Drunken Master) and (Born Invincible) both are very good films in ther own right. And thats only half of the collection. You get three other films on top of that. So if these movies are not in your collection you can't go wrong purchasing this dvd which is in my opinion awsome!",1258329600,2,574,4.476190476190476
8219744,4,B000VSDN32,"When you get 6 movies for the price of one you can't expect Criterion Collcetion video quality. The video quality is decent, I can't say much more on these movies than Morgoth already has.

But if you crave some quality old school kung fu at a great price this is your best bet. Worth the price of admission just to see the surreal yet insane Taoism Drunkard, previously released as Drunken Wu Tang.",1224460800,,399,4.465753424657534
8219745,1,B000VSDN32,"Brought to you by the same people who gave us Grindhouse Experience volume 1 & 2, The Martial Arts Essentials features great kung fu titles but the DVD transfers are among the worst you have ever seen.  SLP mode VHS with picture rolls and shaky picture.  Such a shame...",1213747200,2,270,4.489795918367347
