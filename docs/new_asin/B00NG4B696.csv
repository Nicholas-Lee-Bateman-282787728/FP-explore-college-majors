8677847,5,B00NG4B696,"One could expect little else than excellence from King's College and the historical legacy of Lessons and Carols. I have an earlier version which has the more normal early readings done in succession starting with a chorister or working up to the Dean of the Chapel. This version has about four Scripture readings of the Christmas narrative interspersed with several more contemporary expressions. The music, however, is very much in line with the tradition of the service and most excellently sung. I can without qualification recommend this DVD.",1481068800,,547,5.2272727272727275

8677850,5,B00NG4B696,"A beautiful program. Beautifully sung. The phrases are always so well planned and executed. One wonders if the text is ever a factor for these boys and men. They seem to have faces devoid of expression of the magic of the texts. The only seem to react to the music. The readings and variety of readers was charming, as was the extra material about the boys and their lives as choirboys. It was lovely to see so much history about the choir and its lovely tradition and history. One wonders where some of these vocal scholars are found. They are certainly not equal. Many legends about this choir and its tradition abound, it was good to have it all sorted out in documentary fashion. John Rutter's commentary was charming to go with the others. The Tavener pieces were delightful additions.",1450569600,3,790,4.65

8677854,3,B00NG4B696,"We have the CAROLS FROM KINGS produced over a decade ago, and it is beautiful.

This one is much less exciting, but the big let down was the lack of option for ""music only.""  We put the other DVD in and skip all the text while the house is filled with the carols.  On this one, we could not find that option, thus it does not get put in to play as atmospheric background music and video.  Too bad.",1422057600,4,397,3.9873417721518987
