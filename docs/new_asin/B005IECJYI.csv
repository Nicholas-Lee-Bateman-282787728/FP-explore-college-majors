8474526,5,B005IECJYI,"The Perfumed Arrow is one of the best operas ever filmed, and it features
 the greatest opera singer of all time, Ivy Ling Po. The lavish Shaw Brothers sets
delight the eyes! This movie is entertaining, joyous, and beautiful. The songs
show the complexity of Huangmei opera, because the tempo can change
extremely quickly, and the singers have to be exceptionally skilled in their craft.
I highly recommend this movie. Anyone who purchases a copy will experience
the feeling of having discovered treasure, because it contains vast cultural wealth.",1323216000,,547,5.146067415730337
