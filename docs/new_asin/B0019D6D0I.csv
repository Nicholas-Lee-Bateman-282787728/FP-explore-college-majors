8273596,2,B0019D6D0I,"There's the potential for a good movie in The Rover, a Napoleonic Joseph Conrad yarn that sees Anthony Quinn's beached sailor falling in love with Rosanna Schiaffino's mad girl who lives with her aunt Rita Hayworth only to see her fall in love with Richard Johnson's naval officer, but it only sporadically survives Terence Young's remarkably hamfisted direction and some thuddingly bad editing from Peter Thornton that ensures the action is covered but never looks particularly good and that character moments seem to get lost along the way. It's never as bad as the strikingly badly handled naval skirmish that sees Quinn beating a British blockade but it takes too long for the story to take hold and Young never makes it feel as if any of it matters as much as finishing on time and spending all that lovely money he's getting for making it. There's a decent but repetitive Ennio Morricone score that tries to give it some emotion and the cast try their best to bring some life to it (with the dishonourable exception of a dreadful Anthony Dawson, Young's favorite supporting actor, who's quite exceptionally dismal as a British captain), but this never rises above the level of just-about-acceptable-if-there's-nothing-better-on-the-other-side.

The Spanish PAL DVD does have both English and Spanish soundtrack options, but be warned that the picture quality is like a third-generation videotape - though at present it's just about the only way you can see the film.",1332806400,6,1472,5.082644628099174
8273597,4,B0019D6D0I,"I have been wanting to see this movie for so long. I have never seen Hayworth and Quinn paired together. Both started their careers, I believe, as Spanish dancers. Hayworth is beautiful and Quinn gives a stellar performance as a dedicated sailor that earns the respect even of his enemies.

Beautiful coastline photography. Enjoyable movie without all the gore and bad language of todays movies.",1116892800,8,395,5.076923076923077
