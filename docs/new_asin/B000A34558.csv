8073584,3,B000A34558,"DVD description says 2005, which may well be when it was made. Since all the info was mid 1990s or earlier, I suspect this was a videotape transferred to DVD. It does feature a very young Nick Pope. At the end it did say Copyright 1998, so seven years later put on DVD. So, nothing new, but decent look at where abduction research was seventeen years ago. Video quality good.",1448496000,,375,4.371428571428571

8073586,5,B000A34558,Interesting abduction stories along with plenty of information from plenty of sources with some farmiliar faces like Whitley strieber and a younger Nick Pope a serious look at abductions. I've bought quite a few ufo DVDs off amazon this is probably the best one I will say though that you don't need an abduction to be a spiritual person that just comes with having an open mind,1389916800,9,378,4.656716417910448

8073588,5,B000A34558,"The ""UFO Abductions: A Global Phenomenon ""DVD set was generally well done.
It had eye witness accounts with interviews of various ufologists as well as some scientists. I found the set very entertaining as well as thought provoking. The footage on the different sitings was surprisingly well defined and clear. The overall narration was generally clear and the perspectives presented, although somewhat biased towards the reality of the abduction experience, still had much supporting evidence. I think this is a good pick for those looking for an overview of the subject.",1240704000,19,572,5.2967032967032965
