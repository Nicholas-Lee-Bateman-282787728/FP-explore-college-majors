2628244,5,B000H5U5US,"This is a great ten disc set showcasing what the History Channel always did best in my opinion - document World War II. I haven't liked how the History Channel has ""mainstreamed"" its offerings over the last few years, and thus this set is a real treat for long time viewers. It's also great for your kids to watch if they think that history is boring - it will change their minds. The following are the set's contents:

DISC ONE:

World War II: The War in Europe - Part 1

This disc contains four episodes from War Chronicles, a multiple-episode series of war documentaries written and directed by Don Horan, and hosted and narrated by actor Patrick O'Neal. Running about 26 minutes each in length, the episodes included on this disc were produced in 1983 and 1985. They feature no interviews, just O'Neal and at times, an anonymous narrator who, inexplicable, drops in additional voice-over material explaining in detailed narration over the graphic archival footage, the various battle campaigns. Primitive visual aids are used to highlight the action  which at times consist of just O'Neal, pointing at a map. The episodes included are:

The Greatest Conflict: From the German Blitzkrieg to the Allies' bloody battle for Berlin.

North Africa...The Desert War: Details the German attack on Kasserine Pass, where the British 1st Army and untested American troops faced the full force of Germany's seasoned Afrika Corps.

The Beachhead at Anzio: Follow the story of the Allied landing, the brutal German counterattack, and the final Allied offensive that would turn the tide of this historic battle.

D-Day...The Normandy Invasion: discusses the largest amphibious assault in world history.

DISC TWO:

World War II: The War in Europe - Part 2

A continuation of disc one material. The episodes included are:

Pursuit to the Rhine: The Allies thrust forward under tactical air support to break through German lines, and the enemy resistance ultimately crumbled.

The Bomber Offensive: Air War in Europe: The Allies launched this historic raid on a German munitions factory and ultimately paid an extraordinary price in men and machines, but this battle would prove to be a turning point.

The Battle of the Bulge: It was the largest pitched battle in American military history, the last major engagement of the European campaign, and the scene of some of the war's fiercest fighting, leading to a final blow against the Nazis.

The Battle of Germany: The final campaign of the European theater unfolded in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge with the British and Canadian offensive, the historic crossing of the Rhine at Remagen, and Eisenhower's final drive to Berlin.

DISC THREE:

World War II: The War in the Pacific - Part 1

Again, this is just O'Neal explaining in detailed narration over the graphic archival footage, the various battle campaigns. The episodes included are:

Island Hopping: The Road Back: Follow the epic story of the Allies' island-by-island Pacific campaign in which they utilized massive amphibious assaults.

Jungle Warfare: New Guinea to Burma: In the jungles of the Pacific, soldiers battled not only the Japanese, but malaria, heat exhaustion, and swarms of parasites.

Air War in the Pacific: Chronicling the war's first days through the suicidal Kamikaze attacks and the bombing missions that brought the war to the Japanese homeland, this documentary utilizes extensive air combat footage.

The Bloody Ridges of Peleliu: From the opening naval bombardment, to the hand-to-hand combat and vicious guerrilla warfare, this is the complete story of this brutal and historic battle.

DISC FOUR:

A continuation of disc three. The episodes included are:

The Return to the Philippines: From MacArthur's strategy to the heroics of the ground troops, the 7th Fleet's naval forces, and the pilots of the Air Force, the saga of the Philippines is a story of unstoppable determination.

Okinawa...The Last Battle: Winston Churchill described it as the most intense and famous battle in military history. Witness the desperate, suicidal resistance of the Japanese in the final battle of the Pacific campaign.

In addition to the two War Chronicles episodes, this disc contains a 1995 episode of the Biography series, hosted by Jack Perkins. Perkins, who seemed to pop up on A&E every half hour in the 1990's, was a genial host with a trademark AM radio voice delivery that hooked people into watching his shows. Here, Perkins narrates a 45 minute tribute, with help from interviews with military historians, to Admiral William Halsey who led the Battle of the Bismarck Sea and helped neutralize the Japanese offensive.

DISC FIVE:

Biography: General Douglas MacArthur: Return of a Legend

This disc contains another 50 minute A&E Biography episode, hosted by Jack Perkins, discussing the life and career of General Douglas MacArthur. This episode is narrated by noted actor Fritz Weaver:

General Douglas MacArthur: Return of a Legend: General Douglas MacArthur was one of America's greatest and most complex commanders, a warrior so tough and determined that he helped win World War II with a simple promise: ""I shall return."" Featuring rare footage and interviews with MacArthur's comrades, family, and friends, this Biography program reveals the man who remains a hero to millions.

DISC SIX:

Okinawa: The Final Battle

This disc contains a 50 minute documentary made in 1995, narrated by Fritz Weaver again, exploring the bloody battle in the Pacific.

Okinawa: The Final Battle: At Okinawa, over 250,000 people fought a desperate battle for control of the island, in which nearly half of them died. Dramatic footage, much of it unseen for decades, captures the chaos and destruction of this battle, and military historians probe its lasting legacy.

DISC SEVEN:

Empires of Industry: War Planes of World War II

This disc contains a 50 minute documentary, narrated by Peter Thomas, exploring the planes that were used during WWII. This 1998 documentary is part of the popular A&E Empires of Industry series:

War Planes of World War II: Flight was born in America at the turn of the century. But World War II saw more planes built in a single year - 300,000 - than had been built in the previous forty. Modern shots of restored aircraft, historic footage ranging from factory floors to dogfights, and interviews with pilots and designers recapture the aviation industry's finest hour.

DISC EIGHT:

Nuremberg: Tyranny on Trial

This disc contains a History Channel 1995 50 minute documentary, narrated by Paul Sparer, giving a detailed look at the war tribunals in Nuremberg.

DISC NINE:

Great Blunders of World War II - Part 1

This disc contains four, 21 minute episodes from The History Channel miniseries, Great Blunders of World War II.  These compact little docs from 1998 are fascinating looks at the fatal mistakes made by the Axis powers, that aided the Allied victory:

The German Blunder at Dunkirk: The 1940 Blitzkrieg upon Europe drove the British Expeditionary Force into the sea at Dunkirk, but the reckless plan of attack turned the chance to destroy the British into history's greatest escape.

Hitler's Declaration of War on the U.S.: Even with Hitler's forces ravaging Europe, America hesitated to join the fight against him. All that changed, however, with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and a foolish decision by Germany to ally with Japan.

The Pilot who Bombed London: One lost and confused German pilot mistakenly dropped his bombs on London, igniting what became known as the Blitz and pushing Britain's durability to its furthest limits.

Hitler's Flying Blunders: The Luftwaffe's lighting-fast, short-range fighter-bombers were used in support of highly mobile ground forces, a strategy which ultimately went horribly awry.

In addition to these four episodes, two additional episodes of Great Blunders of World War II are included: The Battle of the Bulge and A Bridge Too Far.

DISC TEN:

Great Blunders of World War II - Part 2

A continuation of the material on disc nine.

Japan's Mistakes at Midway: On June 4, 1942, the fanatical and efficient Japanese war machine wanted to finish off the U.S. Pacific Fleet, but their blind arrogance and underestimation of American willpower led them to disaster instead.

The Failure of the Kamikaze: Steeped in the ancient code of the Samurai, Kamikaze forces on land, sea, and air sacrificed themselves in battle in a desperate bid for victory that spelled ultimate doom for the Japanese Empire.

Death at Stalingrad: In Hitler's quest to take Stalingrad at all costs, he underestimated both the Russian winter and the steadfastness of the Russian people in the face of the Nazi threat.

Operation Sea Lion: In the wake of the British army's flight from France, the British were all but beaten. But a Nazi invasion of England was inexplicably postponed, diverting certain triumph and ultimately leading to the Allied victory.

In addition to these four episodes, two additional episodes of Great Blunders of World War II are included: The Bomb Plot to Kill Hitler and The Scattering of Convoy PQ17.",1165536000,143,9115,5.115462525320729
2628275,5,B000H5U5US,"I gave this series of DVDs 5 Stars because of the manner by which the story is told and it is also a comprehensive collection of some of the very best film taken of the war and much of the film is quite rare, some that I've not seen before.. Actor, Patrick O'Neal, adds his little bit of Magic to the Mix. And lastly, for the money, it is one of the best collections available. For historians, I believe some of the rare unseen film will make this a must have collection. Do not pay attention to the negative reviews of this set of DVD's. It is as good if not better in many places then the BBC Collection and the World at War Set. Great editing and narration.",1375833600,2,660,4.124031007751938
2628276,4,B000H5U5US,"Very informative, and amazing footage. I would very much recommend this DVD series.
My wife was even glued to it!!!",1346976000,,115,4.8

2628278,1,B000H5U5US,"This is the worst video documentary I have EVER seen, not the material, the quality. I have seen much of the footage in other documentaries but this looked as if it was filmed from the television screen into a video camera, uploaded to a disc and sold as something original. Don't take my word for it, I probably wouldn't take the word of a stranger either BUT!! you've been warned ;-(",1326931200,3,385,4.436619718309859
2628279,5,B000H5U5US,"There is a certain bit of redundancy in all of these movies pertinent to WWII, and usually some bit of data one has not heard or seen is there too. Movies, as they age, will have certain flaws that are a bit worrisome, but the wrinkles in my face are also, yet they come with the territory. These films are no exception, but if you are a history buff, as my lady and myself, they are informative.

Good purchase for us.",1309996800,2,419,4.172839506172839

2628281,4,B000H5U5US,"So far I have enjoyed watch the DVD's and beings I like History this was right up my ally. I'm glad that I wasn't in that war, but Vietnam was rough too. So I guess we all had some kind of War in our lives. You get shot at you are in War regardless if the news media call it a police action.",1295654400,,291,3.634920634920635
2628282,5,B000H5U5US,The videos are great. They are features from the history channel and there is some very good footage.,1278806400,2,101,4.666666666666667
2628283,2,B000H5U5US,"There is a poor organization of the material which results in great redundancy between chapters, and worst, a fast run over important material. As example, the Battle of The Bulge is covered at nauseas in several chapters, while the Marianas Turkey Shoot  gets seconds of coverage. Also the narration is rushed, barely in sync with the video show, and poorly supported with maps.",1268438400,5,379,5.015873015873016
2628284,2,B000H5U5US,"generally the shows on history channel are pretty good, but not this one.
It's a simple documentary of all the major event without any depth of analysis.
It listed the unit number, location, date and even time -- which might be important
for historians but definitely very boring for general public.

The only chapter seems to be interesting to me is the last one: Nuremberg Trial.

Even for record purpose, it's missing a lot of stuff. It talked nothing
about Russian battleground, nothing about China(WWII actually started at 1931
when Japan invaded China).

Even for western front line, it's also missing a lot of stuff, it covers ground
war pretty extensively, there are some coverage on Air war, but almost nothing on
the navy battle.

The scenes are duplicated, same scene appears over and over again. Looks like
someone just casually stitch them together.

I wouldn't recommend it at all.",1266451200,6,895,4.94
2628305,2,B000H5U5US,"bought this item hoping it would be like the shows you see on the history channel about the history of ww2, after watching the first two discs its apparent that this series is at least 30 years old. It reminds me of watching old science movies in class. the graphics they have are a picture and yard stick for goodness sakes!",1266192000,3,325,4.344262295081967
2628306,2,B000H5U5US,"I used to be a great fan of the History Channel documentries,  before it transformed itself into the Ice Trucker Channel. I particularly liked the ones narrated by Edward Herrmann. Some of the best documentaries are not in this set. For example, no bios of Hitler, Churchill, Eisenhower or Patton, though there is one on General MacArthur. The only attempt at an overall view of the war are in the first four disks, which covers some of the major battles in Europe (none from the Eastern front) and the Pacific. These 4 disks cover 14 battles, plus a bio of Admiral Halsey, in about 3 1/2 hours. Given the number of battles covered don't expect much depth in these docs. The narrator is the late actor Patrick O'Neal, whose narration voice is an acquired taste. Strangely, the Battle of Okinawa is covered both on these disks and on disk 6. The other topics covered appear to be picked at random from History Channel vaults. The best of this uneven lot are the two disks (9 and 10) on Great Blunders of WW2. Discs 5 through 8 are a rip off, with only 50 minutes of programming on each disk. Surely, A&E, the compiler, could have offered more and better choices.",1263859200,5,1161,4.5285714285714285
2628307,5,B000H5U5US,"I got this for my dad for Father's Day, and I haven't seen it since we live in different state's, but he said it was very good and was very happy with it, he being a retired military man I thought he would enjoy this...I recommend this for any war buff or military person.",1247529600,,272,4.055555555555555

2628309,5,B000H5U5US,"A history buff should really look past the narration and look at the footage.  A majority of the narration in this collection occurred in the early 1980's when soaps ruled the networks and cable was just beginning, so looking at the material from that era, its understandably rough material.

If the narration bothers some, I suggest putting the soundtrack of your favorite war movie on and then watch the images.  Most films of WWII did not have sound, so most anything that you hear in these films are constructed from a sound affects studio done by hand or pre-recorded sounds already in their library.  You cannot possibly judge this by today's cinema standards.

I would recommend picking it up for under $25  because some of the films are already available on other collections, but its nice to have them all gathered in one set.  So that would cost you about $1 per film in this collection.  A bargain.",1235433600,4,909,4.708860759493671

2628311,4,B000H5U5US,I purchased this set for one of my grandchildren and liked it so much that I bought another one for another grandchild.,1203379200,,119,4.454545454545454
2628312,2,B000H5U5US,"I agree with the majority, that this set is very incomplete.  While content presented on WW II is good, I have other issues.

The running time is approximately 810 minutes (not 892 minutes) on 10 DVDs in the standard cases, which requires at least 6 inches of shelf space.  Only 4 DVDs were required, but 10 DVDs were used.

I mainly purchased this set for the 10 Military (Great) Blunders episodes.  I was hugely disappointed that all episodes ran between 20:55 and 21:07 minutes.  I have some of these episodes on VHS and they ran 22 minutes and I was hoping that original running times of perhaps 23 minutes, would be in this set.  The problem is the History Channel (and the rest of the TV universe) keeps cutting runing times for more commercials.  So, the original episodes no longer exists and you get  heavily edited programs.  Maybe, if the History Channel had shipped the original, uncut episodes, 892 minutes may have been correct.

Bottomline, while there are much better choices for WW II content, there is some unique information, so that you don't feel too ripped off.  But, Cable Networks (e.g. History Channel) are the worst of the worst, with commercials galore and distracting on-screen logos.  That's why we buy these DVDs, right?",1180396800,39,1250,4.785046728971962

However, this series should be named ""The United States in World War II.""  There is only a very occasional mention of the critical role of Soviet Union in the war and no footage of the monumental struggle that took place on the Eastern Front.

It seems that if the Americans were not in the fighting, the rest of the war did not exist. Want to know who really won the war; check out the Eastern Front. For serious readers, the war in the U.S.S.R. was the most brutal war in recorded history.",1471824000,,441,4.261904761904762
