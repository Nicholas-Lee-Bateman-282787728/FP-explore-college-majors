8067693,3,B0009VV77U,"I believe the title of this set of cartoons should be more specific about its content. I thought there would be more variety here. My grandchildren enjoy watching it, though, and the transaction was perfect.",1402876800,,207,4.942857142857143
8067694,5,B0009VV77U,"It is (and has been) recommended to youngsters of all ages! It was an entertaining, fun, and very funny DVD!",1395360000,,108,4.45
8067695,4,B0009VV77U,"If you're into old animation, this is a real treat. Granted, the title of the release is misleading as previously posted, but the contents are well worth it. You'll get 2 hours of Dave Fleischer Cartoons in pretty good quality. Some cartoons are turned red, but some preserve the original technicolor quite well. I didn't expect prestine quality and restored cartoons when I bought this budget DVD and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The complete HUNKY AND SPUNKY adventures from the Fleischer Studios' COLOR CLASSICS series are on this DVD, plus another donkey wartime cartoon, as well as a HUNGRY LION cartoon (funny gruesome in many ways) and a color and sound FELIX THE CAT cartoon (""Bold King Cole""), which is quiet surreal. As far as GABBY goes, I know he hasn't got many fans out there, but apart from the repetitive stories you'll get masterful animation from the Fleischers. Herein are seven of the eight GABBY Cartoons produced. Not too bad for a budget DVD. Let's hope somebody will restore these marvels, if that happens to be possible. Until then, this DVD suits me.",1305072000,,1090,4.803191489361702
8067696,1,B0009VV77U,"Make no mistake....these cartoons are from the 1940's, but they consist of two hours of ""Hunky and Spunky"" (a mother and son wild donkeys) and ""Gabby"", an overbearing little character I saw for the first time from the movie ""Gulliver's Travels"". Two hours of just THEM! I would never have bought the DVD had I known that. I can take a few Hunky and Spunky cartoons, I cannot take two hours of GabbY. The title should have had some clarification.",1286841600,11,445,4.575
