8280920,5,B001B157D2,"I loved this DVD as it relieved some of the nausea that I experienced from morning sickness early on and then really helped me eliminate bad leg cramps and lower back pain in the latter stages of my pregnancy. Following on from the first volume in this series of nurturing pregnancy massage techniques, this video is more specific and suggests some really great massage techniques that target all the different problem areas. I used to wake up every night suffering from bad cramps in my lower legs until my partner and I tried out the prenatal massages in this DVD. Couldn't be happier with this product. Will be referring to it in the future if I need to!",1413590400,3,657,4.576271186440678
