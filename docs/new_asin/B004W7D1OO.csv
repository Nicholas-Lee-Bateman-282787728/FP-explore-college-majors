I bought the whole series 1-6 and was very disappointed I have been more interested watching paint dry than listen to his dull teaching for 90 minutes he is very irritating ""if you hear what I'm trying to say"" and his constant scratching the strings to get a beat was very irritating as well.  There might be some useful information but it is so boring I doubt anyone can sit through it for one little tidbit of information.
Another thing that kills this dvd series is the lack of a workbook and to try to play along with him was impossible because the backing tracks were so low all you could hear was him scratching out a beat on the strings and ""I hope you heard what I was trying to do"" everything muddled together very disappointing series I'd rather go to the dentist",1412899200,,953,4.378531073446328
