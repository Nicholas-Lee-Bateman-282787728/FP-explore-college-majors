630117,4,6303362966,"On a lazy Sunday afternoon, while watching some b-grade football, it was decided to incorporate a quality action film into the mix. While looking through the recommended features we came across a film called Crackerjack. The first scentance of the first review stated ""This is the greatest bad movie of all time"" and we were easily sold without reading any further. When selecting your action B you must choose wisely. The criteria for selecting isn't highly specific outside of a few crucial factors. 1) It should have been released in the mid 80's-90's, 2) The main character should preferably be a supreme tough guy, & 3) It should have the promise of offering a highly cliched plot with very poor production value. Crackerjack maintains a healthy level of all these concepts while delivering an extra dose in the ""tough rogue cop"" area. Like the other handful of reviewers said, this is a direct rip off of Die Hard. However that isn't something that upsets us. In fact we love cheap knock offs. We enjoyed Surviving the Game despite it's blatant duplication of Death Ring, without any complaints.

Crackerjack starts off in typical rogue cop fashion as a shootout takes place in a run down building. Here we meet our main character Jack Wild seemingly on a suicide mission. Throwing all caution to the wind, Jack Wild puts himself right in the face of danger while pounding out one-liners with ferocity. It's as if he attended the Chad Mcqueen School of ""Go Stuff Yourself"" graduating cum laude. After the shootout Jack's partner tells him how crazy he is earning him the nickname ""Crackerjack"" and eventually gets put on a leave of absence due to his loose cannon tactics. In order to wind down his brother & sister in-law force him on a trip to mountain resort for some R&R. Obviously this idea would need some catastrophic situation which takes place with a crew of mercenaries run by an ex-mob boss. The crew's plans are to steal a slue of diamonds, blow up the resort, and create an avalanche to cover up the heist. Yes it's a misguided as it sounds. The heist appears to be going off without a hitch until Jack Wild gets involved and single handedly takes down the entire operation. By the end it appears Jack Wild has seen the error of his ways, but will never loose the tough guy within.

Crackerjack clumsily plays out with such an awful plot that you will either stop in within 10 minutes or watch ahead for anything salvageable. For B lovers the choice will be obvious. Films like these are few and far between now a days, rendering them too valuable to pass up. Sure there are plenty of bad movies made every year, but the current flops are a different degree of what the B of 90's had. These films have an unmistakable feel that just can't be explained. Maybe a childhood filled with watching these styles of late night B has left us a bit bias, but we just can't get enough. If you're a fan of the over-cliched cop action films of this decade then Crackerjack will be right up your alley. Without even watching you'll probably be able to recite lines that you'll just assume are there. The plot couldn't be more obvious and perfect all at once. The only draw back was some lulls in which we never advocate. When it's action B you have to leave your viewers on a constant buzz of intensity.",1356825600,8,3308,4.605084745762712

630294,3,6303362966,"I used to think this was a smal action-gem. Years after after having seen it, I bought it and I was a little bit disappointed. As it turns out ""Crackerjack"" isn't really the forgotten gem, I had hoped for, but rather a quite ordinary, run-of-the-mill kind of 80'ties action-flick. Strangely though still a worth while trip down memory lane - at least for me.
Crackerjack is the story of a big city cop working those high profile cases involving organized crime, until one day someone decides, Jack is getting to close for comfort and have a car bomb plantet in his vehicle. Only the bomb doesn't kill Jack but rather his wife and children. Jack is distraught and disappears into a bottle. But Jack has a brother, and he and his wife launches an intervention. They drag Jack - almost kicking and screaming - up into the mountains to a beautifully located mountain resort, hoping a change in scenery might shake up things a bit. In the beginning it doesn't work, but then he comes across the local guide (Nastassja Kinski) and things starts to look a bit less bleak.
Things are about to take a turn for the worse though: A group of unscrupulous gangsters are about to take over the resort and bring everybody's lives in jeopardy, in the pursuit of wealth. And who has to go save the day? Why.. Crackerjack of course.",1426377600,,1314,4.572033898305085
