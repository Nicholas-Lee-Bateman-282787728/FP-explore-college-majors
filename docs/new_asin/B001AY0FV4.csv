8280159,5,B001AY0FV4,"How often does one see a film that, immediately after viewing it, leaves one feeling awe struck and perplexed by the intensity of it all? If after seeing ""A Day at the Beach"" (from 1970), does not elicit that kind of reaction, consider yourself immune from human emotions. In ""A Day at the Beach"" Mark Burns as 'Uncle Bernie' literally bares his soul in an anguish that is too real to be thought of as merely ""acting"".  What an unforgettable and mesmerizing performance! All the more so, when you consider the fact that the film was supposedly ""lost"" or ""misplaced"" by its American distributor---Paramount Pictures and, Mark Burns never got to see himself in one of the greatest portrayals/performances in film history. But, ironically, this is always the case with any great work of Art (film or otherwise), that uncannily resembles---like unto a mirror---life itself!

Some of the reviews here, have given very good insight into the film. However, I tend to think that the subtext to the story is not so much about ""alcoholism"" per se, but more about alienation and the cold reality of life that we as human-beings unnecessarily impose on one another and on ourselves. One can certainly sympathize with this ""character"" that has seemingly given-up on life and has lost all concern and compassion for himself and others, except that of his niece/daughter 'Winnie' (in one of the most sensitive and touching performance by a child-actor from Beatie Edney). However, as his state of drunkenness increases, he becomes negligent in his care of the child as well, that is made all the more heart-wrenching because her love for him remains truly unconditional. A sad and powerful film experience that will tear and nag at your very soul! This harrowing film masterwork is reminiscent and very similar in theme to Louis Malle's own ""Le fou follet"" (""The Fire Within"" from 1963).

I should tell you that, although Roman Polanski wrote the screenplay, the film was directed by Simon Hesera and was shot in Denmark, standing-in for an English seaside resort on a bleak and rainy day. ""A Day at the Beach"" is the kind of film that a select few will instantly recognize and distinguish it for its rarefied elements likened unto pure Alchemy itself.

The DVD picture and sound quality is very good, despite the slight technical flaws in the film itself (it seems like the film went through some post-dubbing that isn't synchronized all that well. But this is mostly in the outdoor scenes and is not overly distracting from the action taking place). NTSC, English (no subtitles), NR 84 mins.

I hope one day this film is made available to a wider audience, perhaps through Criterion. Offbeat, dreamy and unique---this is a film not to be missed!!!!...ScottyB",1297728000,6,396,5.107692307692307
8280163,5,B001AY0FV4,"Watching anyone self-destruct is a sad subject for entertainment, but two (2) films come to mind about the self-hating alcoholic's love affair with the bottle.  ""The Days of Wine and Roses"" is one of those films and ""A Day at the Beach"" is the other, with the latter far more extreme and memorable (for me).

The entire location setting is a drizzle/rain day at the Beach (the atmospheric filming is spectacular) with father visiting his daughter on a visitation visit (daughter lives with Mother and her new husband).  The daughter wears leg braces, which even expands her sympathy value and it worked.  I was a crying mess by about the halfway mark in the film.  Daughter watching father sinking lower and lower is horrorfying.  He can't seem to be able to control himself and she can't do a thing to help him.

Whether you are a drinker or not, it matters none.  All you need is an interest in a very disfunctional father/daughter relationship and have the strength to witness an extremely emotional story with excellent Actors all around.
