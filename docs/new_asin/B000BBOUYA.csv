2411293,4,B000BBOUYA,"""There ain't no soft-hearted gunfighters"" says Matthew Sebanek (Warren Oates) to Clayton Drumm (Fabio Testi) late in Monte Hellman's lyrical western ""China 9 Liberty 37"" (a/k/a ""Amore, piombo e furore""). The English title is simply the words on the sign at a crossroads, which is shown at the start of the film.

Hellman fans will be happy to finally find this film available on DVD, as a 2005 release by Mill Creek Entertainment. The second movie on the DVD, ""Gone With the West"" (a/k/a ""Little Moon and Old Jug""), is a James Caan-Sammy Davis Jr. western best described as ""The Rat Pack on LSD"". The cast includes ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."". It is a horrible western made even worse by the condition of the print they used to make the DVD, but it does feature one of the most intense cat-fights in cinema history.

The print for ""China 9"" is a bit better but suffers from a poor ""pan and scan"" full-screen treatment and weak audio tracks. It also has some editing glitches, which probably resulted from the need to cobble together a decent print for transfer to DVD. And I suspect the original release was longer than this 98minute version.

Hellman and Oates also collaborated on ""The Shooting"" and if you enjoyed that effort you should really like ""China 9"". In ""China 9"" he plays a retired gunfighter mining gold on land he refuses to sell to the railroad. Testi (the best of a long line of English-challenged pretty-boy European actors who worked in the western genre in the 60's and 70's) is hired by the railroad to kill Matthew. But the two gunfighters hit it off and Testi refuses to complete the job. In the meantime Matthew's wife Catherine (Jenny Agutter) comes on to Clayton. They run off together believing she has killed Matthew but he survives and begins to hunt them down. To add additional complications to the story, the railroad recruits a squad of gunfighters to kill both Matthew and Clayton.

Clayton Drum is good western hero. Although he drinks a lot of cocaine based tonic, he maintains his professional integrity and refuses to sell out to the wild west show promoters or the dime novelists. The world may be changing and making him irrelevant but he sticks to his principles. ""My life is not for sale"".

Fans of ""The Hunting Party"" will find a familiar storyline, Fellini fans will find a nice homage to their favorite director, and Sam Peckinpah fans will find an actual appearance-while just a small speaking part it is more than just a cameo.

The action sequences are extremely well staged, although the effects are on the cheap side. The action in the big final showdown scene is totally credible and leaves one wondering why other directors can't exercise their imaginations and come up with equally plausible shootouts. Plus there is an extremely nice twist to the story's resolution that you don't see coming. Finally, Hellman goes out on a slick ""mise en scene"" shot that actually advances the story a final notch.

""China 9"" is an absolute must-see for fans of Jenny Agutter. Hellman liked to give his films an overexposed grainy look (as if the film stock was pushed a couple of stops in processing). Combined with minimal makeup this gave his heroines a strikingly haunting and earthy beauty, check out Millie Perkins in ""The Shooting"" and ""Ride the Whirlwind"". Like Perkins, Agutter has never looked better and is more than credible as the catalyst of this love triangle.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1137888000,4,3459,4.753333333333333
2411294,5,B000BBOUYA,Product arrived safely. It is a good commodity. Thank you.,1450224000,,58,4.9
2411295,1,B000BBOUYA,"The quality of the movie and the sound track were so poor it was not enjoyable to watch.  Also, my friend had seen it before, and he noted that there were many important scenes edited out of this version.  Very dispointing.",1441843200,2,223,4.414634146341464
2411296,5,B000BBOUYA,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO STREAMED VERSION (there are a few so make sure you choose the correct one).  This is the uncut longer version (not the shortened 93 minute version) us fans have been looking for!! It is anamorphic widescreen 2.35 and looks pretty good (compared to copies and dupes of the pan and scan version) but could look better with a proper restoration from the likes of Criterion (who love Monte Hellman films). This is a cult classic starring the wonderful Warren Oates, Fabio Testi and Jenny Agutter (her scenes are back in!) and has some great cinematography. Just wished Amazon offered this version to purchase instead of renting. I have been waiting a LONG time to finally see the uncut version of this great western and would kill to have this in my video library! This is the only version you should seek out and not the others (since there seems to be no legit widescreen DVD of this cut).",1431820800,11,937,4.610778443113772
2411297,1,B000BBOUYA,Does Amazon do this with all their films?  All nudity is edited out.  Besides that the picture and sound were awful.,1429228800,2,116,4.476190476190476
2411298,1,B000BBOUYA,"Quality was terrible.  It felt like I was watching and old home movie on 8mm, or worse.  Also, it is my understanding this version was heavily edited.",1428451200,,150,4.518518518518518

2411301,2,B000BBOUYA,this film has been cut despite what the advertising says.........low quality film transfer its like watching a old old VHS tape.......sound quality also bad had difficulty following dialogue with no subtitles to help.......unless you are a big fan of Monte Hellman and want to see early example of his work I would advise you to not waste your money,1421625600,,349,4.932203389830509

2411305,4,B000BBOUYA,"It is a beautifully filmed movie that reminds me in places of Roeg.  Jenny oh Jenny.  Really feels like a product of its time in a great way.  I love romantic westerns and those sentimental moments that simple music put over the right image and the power that can create.  This movie has a few of these scenes.  Fabulous print as far as I am concerned.  This should be read in the context of ""Jenny oh Jenny"" and what distortions in judgement this may produce.  I like the film.",1407715200,,478,4.303370786516854

2411307,2,B000BBOUYA,Hard to judge to film when it is such a poor quality transfer. Even a young Jenny Agutter can't help,1403827200,,100,4.05
2411308,3,B000BBOUYA,Deleted scenes. I am not happy. When I purchase a movie I want the FULL movie not one with scenes deleted. Not satisfied at all.,1396137600,,128,4.16

2411312,3,B000BBOUYA,While this was a pretty good western this version was not remastered and was edited . The uncut remastered version (98 MIN.) is a much better viewing on YouTube which is excellent! The streaming was very good and this rating is strictly for the movie quality.,1387670400,,259,4.6521739130434785
2411313,1,B000BBOUYA,"production values were awful, probably due to the age of the movie which is why they shouldn't have released it to video",1383350400,,120,4.5

2411315,3,B000BBOUYA,"Well made, good performances by all but lacked the fast-paced action of the usual Italian western. Warren Oates was right at home in this role.",1364515200,,143,4.76
2411316,1,B000BBOUYA,"Horribly edited version with almost half an hour missing. Quality is terrible. Looks like it came from VHS. Not only that, but it's edited actually out of sequence in one spot and the rest is just chopped up like a lawn mower did it. If you are looking for the classic movie, look elsewhere, 'cause this isn't it.",1363305600,3,313,4.413793103448276
2411317,2,B000BBOUYA,"This movie is advertised as being uncut, but this is not true.  The Jenny Agutter scenes are edited by zooming in on the scene which does not shorten the length of the movie.

2411318,1,B000BBOUYA,"Seven or eight years ago I saw this movie on the 'Westerns Channel' and it was the complete, uncut, unedited, film. Since the full movie exists and is available for broadcast, why can't it be put on DVD? The movie studios don't seem to care at all about the consumers whose money they rely on to keep them in business! They have replaced 'supply and demand' with 'buy what WE demand"". Well, I, for one, will not buy anything other than the full movie. If it is never released, then so be it; but I refuse to buy a cut up version.",1197763200,52,529,4.196078431372549

2411320,2,B000BBOUYA,"Warning: This DVD appears to have been transferred directly from a low quality film print, and the scenes have been editted and cut (for what purpose, I have no idea).

2411321,1,B000BBOUYA,"What is it with the studios and China 9, Liberty 37?  The original R-rated version was a must see for Jenny Agutter fans.  However, all DVD versions (this one included) have the great Jenny scenes completely edited out.  If it's Jenny you want to see, my suggestion is to spend your funds on Equus or Walkabout.  Maybe one day the studios will get the message that viewers want the unedited/uncut version of this movie.",1186617600,47,419,4.621621621621622
