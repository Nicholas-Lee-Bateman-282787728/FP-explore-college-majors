8031807,5,B0002TR30E,"Equistretch Level 2 is a fabulous evolution of the conditioning established in the first Equistretch.  The exercises address all the fitness issues which are (or should be!) important to a rider.  I am finding Level 2 especially helpful in developing overall flexibility, left-right symmetry, core strength, and awareness of and control over the all-important rider's seat.  The workout leaves me feeling so much better that it's easy to make time for it.",1274745600,,455,5.291666666666667
